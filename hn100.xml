That all changed when Alfonso Bialetti invented the Moka Express in 1933, inspired by a washing machine his wife used to do laundry. But the Moka didn’t really catch on until after WWII, when Alfonso’s son Renato refined the octagonal Art Deco design to maximize heat capture in the base and replace the flammable wooden handle with a modern Bakelite one.</p><p>More importantly, Renato was a marketing genius who innovated advertising techniques in the 1950s to include billboards, commercials, and even animations — introducing “l’omino coi baffi” (the little man with a mustache), based on Renato himself. The little man appeared on the side of the Moka pot and also starred in cartoons showing how quick and easy it was to make coffee with the Moka Express: all you need is water, coffee, and fire to brew espresso-style (it’s not quite espresso) coffee in the comfort of your own home. Since then, an estimated 300 million Moka pots have been sold, and today you can find them in 90% of Italian homes.</p></div><div><p>The Moka Express consists of three primary cast aluminum parts: a bottom chamber for water, a middle funnel-shaped filter basket for coffee grounds, and a top chamber to collect the brewed coffee.<br>‍<br>To brew, fill the bottom chamber with water up to just below the safety release valve in the wall. Then add medium-fine ground coffee (slightly coarser than you’d use for espresso) to the filter basket, but don’t tamp it down. Screw the top chamber back on and place on a stovetop at medium heat. Be careful to avoid an open flame going beyond the edges of the base, otherwise you’ll end up with a stalactite of melted plastic at the end of your handle — as you can see in this well-loved Moka pot that we scanned.&nbsp;<br>‍<br>As the water heats up, it creates steam. The steam pressure forces the hot water up through the coffee grounds in the filter basket and into the top chamber. Take it off the heat before the volcanic sputtering phase at the end; this only adds bitterness to your coffee.</p><p>The aluminum components prove to be pretty hearty, and if you don’t use abrasive cleaners, the Moka pot develops a coffee patina that some believe enhances the flavor. The gasket around the filter basket wears out over time and will eventually need to be replaced. Here you see how the rubber has dried and cracked, making a secure seal impossible. Steam and water would escape, resulting in an incomplete extraction.</p><p>Renato Bialetti died in 2016 at the age of 93, and his ashes were interred in a giant Moka pot. Not long after, Bialetti declared bankruptcy but managed to stay afloat after consolidating their business and securing loans. They moved some of their manufacturing outside of Italy, and our CT scans make us wonder if the new Moka Express that we bought on Amazon is a counterfeit or if the quality of the product has fallen off in recent years. Let’s take a look.</p><p>We didn’t need a CT scanner to observe grease around the threading and unwanted aluminum shavings in the lower chamber, but cropping into the center column, we see an uneven surface finish with aluminum debris that hopefully wouldn’t find its way into our coffee.</p><p>The quality of the casting in this piece is also inferior. Cropping into the walls, we find the new Moka pot riddled with porosity. These tiny voids in the aluminum may not represent a problem for the performance of the brewer, but they suggest that changes to the casting process or the use of new suppliers may have had unintended consequences. The old Moka pot had visible flash inside the lower chamber from where the pieces of the mold came together, but there’s none to be seen in the new one. Even if Bialetti isn’t what it once was, the Moka pot is here to stay as a beloved brewing technique and icon of industrial design.</p><p><a href="https://www.lumafield.com/article/discover-the-art-and-science-of-coffee-with-x-ray-ct">Explore the Scans</a></p></div></div></div><div role="listitem"><div id="aeropress"><p><img alt="Intro image for the scan." loading="lazy" src="https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb266dacb057e3fa39ea6_Aeropress_N93A9864.png" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 50vw" srcset="https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb266dacb057e3fa39ea6_Aeropress_N93A9864-p-500.png 500w, https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb266dacb057e3fa39ea6_Aeropress_N93A9864-p-800.png 800w, https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb266dacb057e3fa39ea6_Aeropress_N93A9864-p-1080.png 1080w, https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb266dacb057e3fa39ea6_Aeropress_N93A9864.png 1500w"></p></div><div><div><h3>AeroPress</h3><h5>Aerobie, 2005</h5><p>The AeroPress was invented by Alan Adler, a retired engineering professor and coffee enthusiast, and introduced to the world in 2005. Unlike traditional brewing methods, the AeroPress utilizes a unique combination of air pressure and immersion brewing, delivering a smooth, rich cup of coffee in under a minute. Its ease of use and portability made it an instant hit among coffee lovers and travelers alike. Over the years, the AeroPress has garnered a devoted following, inspiring coffee championships and daring experiments with brewing techniques.</p></div><div><p>The AeroPress consists of two main parts: a cylindrical chamber and a plunger with a rubber seal. To brew coffee with the AeroPress, you place a paper or metal filter inside the bottom of the plastic mesh filter chamber (on the top in the visualization at left). You then add coffee grounds on top of the filter and pour hot water into the chamber. Give the coffee and water mixture a stir to ensure even extraction.<br>‍<br>Once the coffee has steeped for the desired amount of time, insert the plunger into the top of the chamber. Gently pressing down on the plunger creates air pressure that forces the brewed coffee through the filter and into the cup below. You can adjust the plunger’s pressure to create different coffee strengths and flavors, allowing full customization.</p><div><p>The silicone seal gasket wears down over time, but not as much as you would expect from this seven-year-old AeroPress. Cropping into it from the side, there’s a 0.5 mm gap that we can measure in our Voyager analysis software. Removing used coffee immediately after brewing and storing the AeroPress with the seal pushed all the way through the chamber (as shown) can help minimize wear by reducing compression to extend the gasket’s life.&nbsp;</p><p>Now let’s compare our old AeroPress to a brand new one.</p></div><p>The densities of the old AeroPress chamber and plunger were very similar, both appearing light green in our color map. The chamber of the new AeroPress, however, is made of lower density plastic, which shows up as darker in our color map. Perhaps this change in material will lead to reduced wear over time for the plunger. Though the original AeroPress was made of clear polycarbonate, the company switched to using BPA-free copolyester in 2009 and then in 2014 they changed to (also BPA-free) polypropylene — a durable but lightweight thermoplastic. The density shift evident in our comparison scans is the difference between the copolyester and polypropylene models.</p><p>If you’re an AeroPress user, dealing with leaks or drips during brewing can be frustrating and messy. Loose or improperly sealed filters and caps are common culprits that can allow water to escape. Another cause is using water that’s too hot, which can lead to plastic expansion and gaps. To avoid leaks, ensure the filter is securely placed and the cap is tightly screwed for a proper seal. Using a slightly coarser grind size can alleviate pressure and reduce leaks. Optimal water temperature (175°F to 185°F) minimizes plastic expansion and potential gaps, helping to ensure a leak-free cup of coffee.</p><p><a href="https://www.lumafield.com/article/discover-the-art-and-science-of-coffee-with-x-ray-ct">Explore the Scans</a></p></div></div></div><div role="listitem"><div id="gooseneck-kettle"><p><img alt="Intro image for the scan." loading="lazy" src="https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb2455eb38b96ebfcd84e_Fellow_Kettle_N93A9891.png" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 50vw" srcset="https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb2455eb38b96ebfcd84e_Fellow_Kettle_N93A9891-p-500.png 500w, https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb2455eb38b96ebfcd84e_Fellow_Kettle_N93A9891-p-800.png 800w, https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb2455eb38b96ebfcd84e_Fellow_Kettle_N93A9891-p-1080.png 1080w, https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb2455eb38b96ebfcd84e_Fellow_Kettle_N93A9891.png 1500w"></p></div><div><div><h3>Gooseneck kettle</h3><h5>Fellow, 2022</h5><p>The gooseneck kettle gained prominence with the rise of manual pour-over brewing methods, such as the V60 and Chemex, which require precise control over water flow and distribution. The long, slender spout of a gooseneck kettle allows you to pour water in a slow, controlled, and circular motion. An even saturation of the coffee grounds promotes consistent extraction and ultimately a well-balanced and flavorful cup of coffee. The gooseneck design also helps prevent splashing, ensuring a mess-free and enjoyable brewing experience. Fellow is at the top of the gooseneck game with their Stagg EKG electric kettle line. Let’s see how they manage to achieve unmatched precision in temperature control with our CT scans of both the kettle body and base.</p></div><div><p>With a sleek minimalist design, the Fellow Stagg kettle combines both form and function. Its precision-pour spout has a stainless steel fluted tip that provides optimal control of water flow. Cropping into the counterbalanced handle, we discover the dense embedded weight that shifts the center of mass closer to your hand and makes it easy to maintain a steady stream of water while pouring.<br>‍<br>Notice the recessed edge around the circumference of the kettle body base. This increases the surface area exposed to the heating element and speeds up the formation of the convection current to evenly distribute heat throughout the kettle.</p><p>With the powerful 1200 W heating element (the thin coil wire), the kettle reaches optimal temperature very quickly — in under three minutes. Hidden in the base, we also see a thermal cutoff switch, a mandated safety device that helps prevent fires by interrupting electrical current when the temperature exceeds a certain limit. If you peek into most kettles, you’ll also see a temperature sensor poking its head up. This “boil-dry protection” automatically shuts off when it detects that the water has evaporated or the kettle has been left empty for too long. In the center we see the copper rings that link up with the base coupler.</p><p>But the base is where the magic really happens. In the lower left corner is a small LCD temperature display screen. On the lower right is the main button and dial. There are two toggle switches on the back. On the left, you can switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius (F/C), and on the right, you can set the kettle to hold a temperature for up to an hour. There’s also a hidden game in the Stagg EKG and Corvo EKG kettles. If you remove your kettle from the base and toggle the F/C switch back and forth, you’ll unlock a snake-like game called Wormy that you can play using the dial.</p><p>Decreasing the opacity of the lower-density snap-fit plastic exterior, we have an excellent view into the kettle base’s internal circuitry. There’s a cable strain relief entrance at the top that keeps the power cord safely connected to the device. The larger wires we see here deliver 120 V household current to the heating element. The smaller wires power the digital electronics (screen and dial).</p><p>The Fellow EKG Stagg kettle features a sophisticated PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) controller that uses a solenoid relay switch and MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor). Instead of kicking on and overshooting the target once the temperature has fallen well below it, the PID controller’s non-mechanical approach ensures uniform heating and precise temperature control with minimal fluctuations (±0.3° C). The solenoid relay and MOSFET work in series; the MOSFET flutters to modulate power supply to the heating element inside the kettle. Departing from basic on/off mechanical relays — the annoying click sound that other kettles make — Fellow’s advanced system employs Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) for gradual power adjustments.</p><p><a href="https://www.lumafield.com/article/discover-the-art-and-science-of-coffee-with-x-ray-ct">Explore the Scans</a></p></div></div></div><div role="listitem"><div id="burr-grinder"><p><img alt="Intro image for the scan." loading="lazy" src="https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb2376f778a04b8e28821_Coffee_Grinder_N93A9928.png" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 50vw" srcset="https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb2376f778a04b8e28821_Coffee_Grinder_N93A9928-p-500.png 500w, https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb2376f778a04b8e28821_Coffee_Grinder_N93A9928-p-800.png 800w, https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb2376f778a04b8e28821_Coffee_Grinder_N93A9928-p-1080.png 1080w, https://assets.website-files.com/6202f89a2c14fae9e9222dc3/64ebb2376f778a04b8e28821_Coffee_Grinder_N93A9928.png 1500w"></p></div><div><div><h3>Burr grinder</h3><h5>Porlex, 2018</h5><p>The scientific precision characteristic of the Third and Fourth Wave of coffee culture places a premium on grind quality. Blade grinders, like in a blender, chop coffee beans with their sharp edges and get the job done quickly, but they produce grounds that are uneven in size and shape. Burr grinders offer a more consistent and precise grind size compared to blade grinders. They use two serrated components, known as burrs, to crush the coffee beans to a uniform size, resulting in a more even extraction during brewing. Burr grinders also generate less heat than blades during the grinding process, minimizing the risk of overheating the coffee grounds and preserving the delicate flavors and aromas.</p></div><div><p>This handheld burr grinder made in Japan by Porlex is perfect for on-the-go brewing, making it a great companion for an AeroPress. The stainless steel body holds 40 grams of coffee in the hopper. Instead of twisting the body like a pepper grinder, you crank the handle like an old-fashioned coffee mill to turn the internal conical burr, while the external ring burr remains stationary. Ground coffee collects in the bottom chamber, and you disassemble to retrieve it. You can see we missed a few grounds on our last cup of coffee; there are remnants in the bottom right of the chamber.</p><p>Conical burrs allow for a wider surface area, which leads to a slower and more controlled grinding process. Compared to flat burrs, conical burrs also create a more uniform particle size distribution, reducing the potential for clogs and jams. Porlex grinders use high-quality precision-milled ceramic materials. Ceramic remains sharper for longer than steel, does not rust, and imparts no metallic flavor to the coffee. Ceramic burrs have high thermal capacity and don’t warm the coffee during grinding. All of the advantages a burr grinder has over a blade grinder are taken to their highest level with ceramic burrs.</p><p>Burr grinders also have the advantage of unmatched precision in their ability to adjust grind size to suit different brewing methods. We compared our six-year-old Porlex grinder to a new one, and discovered a redesigned ring burr with additional teeth. Instead of the original six, there are now 15 steps of adjustment. Each click on the adjustment ring under the burrs changes an average of 37 microns, allowing you to dial your exact specifications for everything from cold brew to espresso.</p><p>We also compared the tiny lower teeth and found no detectable wear and only a slight misalignment between the burrs on the used grinder. Despite the somewhat labor-intensive nature of this analogue tool, the quality of its materials and construction allow it to outperform newer technologies.</p><p><a href="https://www.lumafield.com/article/discover-the-art-and-science-of-coffee-with-x-ray-ct">Explore the Scans</a></p></div></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="RADEON" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/radeon.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
With the in-development Linux 6.6 kernel <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.6-DRM-Graphics-Drivers">adding support for more upcoming Radeon graphics processors</a>, that means more auto-generated header files for the new IP blocks... I was curious to see the overall size now of the AMDGPU kernel driver along with its associated code like the AMDKFD compute driver. It's now above 5 million lines for the kernel driver portion.
</p><p>
Following the DRM-Next merge to Linux 6.6, I ran some <em>cloc</em> stats on the AMD Linux kernel graphics driver code. In particular, the <em>drivers/gpu/drm/amd/</em> area that contains the modern code around the AMDGPU DRM driver with AMDKFD compute, display code, common header files, etc (but not counting the older "Radeon" driver in <em>drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/</em>). This open-source AMD Linux kernel graphics driver amounts to more than 5 million lines:
</p><pre>    2173 text files.
    2172 unique files.                                          
       5 files ignored.

github.com/AlDanial/cloc v 1.90  T=16.28 s (133.2 files/s, 309249.2 lines/s)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Language                     files          blank        comment           code

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>Of course, much of that is auto-generated header files... A large portion of it with AMD continuing to introduce new auto-generated header files with each new generation/version of a given block. These verbose header files has been AMD's alternative to creating exhaustive public documentation on their GPUs that they were once known for.
</p><p>
Meanwhile the open-source NVIDIA "Nouveau" driver is around 201k (21.7k blank lines, 24.3k lines of comments, and 155k lines of code). Or the Intel i915 DRM kernel graphics driver is around 381k lines via the same cloc judgment.
</p><p>
It's also worth reminding users that this is just the kernel graphics driver code and not counting all of the code within Mesa for providing the OpenGL and Vulkan driver support or other user-space components.
</p><p>
The entire Linux kernel source tree as of this morning comes in at around 34.8 million lines, including the documentation, various in-tree utilities/tools, other helpers, etc. That figure is from 4,414,747 blank lines, 4,246,577 lines of comments, and 26,168,342 detected lines of code.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>I’ve been thinking recently about anti-racism and what it looks like to support
colleagues from underrepresented groups at work. The other day someone in a
Slack group made an offhand comment that they’d sent a message to an engineer’s
manager to say that the engineer was doing exceptional work.</p>

<p>I think telling someone’s manager they’re doing great work is a pretty common
practice and it can be really helpful, but it’s easy to forget to do and I wish
someone had suggested it to me earlier. So let’s talk about it!</p>

<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1280918150289281025">tweeted about this to ask how people approach it</a> and as usual I got a ton of great replies that I’m going to summarize here.</p>

<p>We’re going to talk about what to say, when to do this, and why you should ask first.</p>

<h3 id="ask-if-it-s-ok-first">ask if it’s ok first</h3>

<p>One thing that at least 6 different people brought up was the importance of
asking first. It might not be obvious why this is important at first — you’re
saying something positive! What’s the problem?</p>

<p>So here are some potential reasons saying something positive to someone’s
manager could backfire:</p>

<ol>
<li>Giving someone a compliment that’s not in line with their current goals. For
example, if your coworker is trying to focus on becoming a technical expert
in their domain and you’re impressed with their project management skills,
they might not want their project management highlighted (or vice versa!).</li>
<li>Giving someone the wrong “level” of compliment. For example, if they’re a
very senior engineer and you say something like “PERSON did
SIMPLE_ROUTINE_TASK really well!” — that doesn’t reflect well on them and
feels condescending. This can happen if you don’t know the person’s position
or don’t understand the expectations for their role.</li>
<li>If your coworker was supposed to be focusing on a specific project, and
you’re complimenting them for helping with something totally unrelated,
their manager might think that they’re not focusing on their “real” work.
One person mentioned that they got reprimanded by their manager for getting
a spot peer bonus for helping someone on another team.</li>
<li>Some people have terrible managers (for example, maybe the manager will feel
threatened by your coworker excelling)</li>
<li>Some people just don’t like being called out in that way, and are happy with
the level of recognition they’re getting!</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall: a lot of people (for very good reasons!) want to have control over the
kind of feedback their manager hears about them.</p>

<p>So just ask first! (“hey, I was really impressed with your work on X project
and wanted to send this note to $MANAGER to explain how important your work
because I know she wasn’t that involved in X project and might not have seen
everything you did, is that ok with you?”)</p>

<h3 id="when-it-s-important-to-highlight-work-that-isn-t-being-recognized">when it’s important: to highlight work that isn’t being recognized</h3>

<p>Okay, now let’s talk about when this is important to do. I think this is pretty
simple – managers don’t always see the work their reports are doing, and if
someone is doing really amazing work that their manager isn’t seeing, they
won’t get promoted as quickly. So it’s helpful to tell managers about work that
they may not be seeing.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of types of important work that might be underrecognized:</p>

<ul>
<li>work by someone from another department (maybe their manager doesn’t
understand how helpful their contribution was to the company because they
don’t work with your team that much, but your coworker’s work made a huge
difference!)</li>
<li>work that happened in a private channel (for example if someone spent hours
helping you with something 1:1 and it really made a big difference to the
success of your project)</li>
<li>work preventing problems, which often isn’t as visible as firefighting work</li>
<li>work by people from underestimated groups (maybe your coworker’s work isn’t
being recognized as much as it should be because of racism/sexism/etc!)</li>
<li>documentation/code review/other kinds of work that aren’t always as visible
as programming</li>
<li>work by remotes (if remote work is less visible at your company)</li>
<li>work by someone in a role that’s typically underrecognized (someone mentioned
support as an example)</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, everyone agreed that it’s always great to highlight the contributions of
more junior coworkers when they’re doing well.</p>

<h3 id="why-it-matters-it-helps-managers-make-a-case-for-promotion">why it matters: it helps managers make a case for promotion</h3>

<p>For someone to get promoted, they need evidence that they’ve been doing
valuable work, and managers don’t always have the time to put together all that
evidence. So it’s important to be proactive!</p>

<p>You can work on this for yourself by writing a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/">brag
document</a>, but having statements from
coworkers explaining how great your work really helps build credibility.</p>

<p>So providing these statements for your coworkers can help them get recognized
in a timely way for the great work they did (instead of getting promoted a year
later or something). It’s extra helpful to do this if you know the person is up
for promotion.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-do-it-be-specific-explain-the-impact-of-their-work">how to do it: be specific, explain the impact of their work</h3>

<p>Pretty much everyone agreed that it’s helpful to explain what specifically the
person did that was awesome (“X did an incredible job of designing this system
and we haven’t had any major operational issues with it in the 6 months since
it launched, which is really unusual for a project of that scale”).</p>

<h3 id="how-to-do-it-highlight-when-they-re-exceeding-expectations">how to do it: highlight when they’re exceeding expectations</h3>

<p>Because the point is to help people get promoted, it’s important to highlight
when people are exceeding expectations for their level, for example if they’re
not a senior engineer yet but they’re doing the kind of work you’d expect from
a senior engineer.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-do-it-send-the-person-the-message-too">how to do it: send the person the message too</h3>

<p>We already basically covered this in “ask the person first”, but especially if
I’m using a feedback system where the person might not get the feedback
immediately I like to send it to them directly as well. It’s nice for them to
hear and they can also use it later on!</p>

<h3 id="public-recognition-can-be-great-too">public recognition can be great too!</h3>

<p>A couple of folks mentioned that they like to give public recognition, like
mentioning how great a job someone did in a Slack channel or team meeting.</p>

<p>Two reasons public recognition can be good:</p>

<ol>
<li>It helps build credibility for your colleague</li>
<li>It lets the person you’re recognizing be part of the
conversation/reciprocate to the feedback-giver, especially if the work was a
collaboration.</li>
</ol>

<p>Again, it’s good to ask about this before doing this – some people dislike
public recognition.</p>

<h3 id="on-peer-bonuses">on peer bonuses</h3>

<p>A few people who work at Google (or other companies with peer bonuses)
mentioned that they prefer to give peer bonuses for this because it’s a more
official form of recognition.</p>

<p>Lots of people mentioned other forms of feedback systems that they use instead
of email. Use whatever form of recognition is appropriate at your company!</p>

<h3 id="anyone-can-do-this">anyone can do this</h3>

<p>What I like about this is it’s a way everyone can help their coworkers – even
if you’re really new and don’t feel that qualified to comment on how effective
someone more senior is at their job, you can still point out things like “this
person helped me do a project that was really out of my comfort zone!”</p>

<h3 id="maybe-expand-the-set-of-people-you-do-this-for">maybe expand the set of people you do this for!</h3>

<p>I think it’s very common for people to promote the work of their friends in
this way. I’ve tried to expand the set of people I do this for over time – I
think it’s important to keep an eye out for coworkers who are really excelling
and to make sure their work is recognized.</p>



<p>I wanted to just talk about this one specific practice of telling someone’s
manager they’re doing great work but there are a LOT of other ways you can help
lift your coworkers up. Lara Hogan’s post <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/what-sponsorship-looks-like/">what does sponsorship look
like?</a> has a lot of
great examples.</p>

<p>Mekka Okereke has a wonderful Twitter thread about another way you can support
underrepresented folks: by being a <a href="https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1027552459873378304">“difficulty anchor”</a>. It’s
short and definitely worth a read.</p>

<p><small>thanks to Sher Minn Chong, Allie Jones, and Kamal Marhubi for reading a draft of this</small></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/31/23853618/x-privacy-policy-update-biometrics-job-history">https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/31/23853618/x-privacy-policy-update-biometrics-job-history</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37338585">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>X, the platform previously known as Twitter, is expanding the amount of data it collects on users. The social network has updated its <a href="https://twitter.com/en/privacy#x-privacy-1">privacy policy</a> to include carveouts for “biometric information” and “employment history,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-31/x-plans-to-collect-user-biometric-data-job-and-education-history?sref=ExbtjcSG">as spotted by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>.</p><p>“Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes,” the privacy policy reads. It doesn’t include any details on what kind of biometric information this includes — or how X plans to collect it — but it typically involves fingerprints, iris patterns, or facial features. </p><p>X Corp. was named in a <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jnswire/jns-media/4e/52/13288870/2023ch06416.pdf">proposed class action lawsuit</a> in July over claims that its data collection violates the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. The lawsuit alleges that X “has not adequately informed individuals” that it “collects and/or stores their biometric identifiers in every photograph containing a face” that’s uploaded to the platform.</p><p>One possibility for using biometric data is enabling passwordless sign-ins. According to <a href="https://www.thetapedrive.com/p/x-twitter-and-linkedin-to-support">findings from app developer Steve Moser</a>, X plans on rolling out support for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/5/23293643/apple-passkeys-fido-alliance-passwordless-google-microsoft">passkeys</a>, which can use your device’s fingerprint, facial recognition, or PIN to log in to your account.</p><p>The privacy policy adds that X may also collect “your employment history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and abilities, job search activity and engagement.” That’s likely related to the job search features that X owner Elon Musk has hinted at including. The platform <a href="https://twitter.com/XHiring/status/1695154429828247798?s=20">rolled out the beta of a hiring feature</a> for companies last week and <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1697145283472244974?s=20">also plans on adding video and audio calls</a> with “no phone number needed.”</p><p>The current privacy policy, <a href="https://twitter.com/en/privacy#twitter-privacy-1">which you can read here</a>, makes no mention of the collection of biometric data or information related to employment history. According to a notice at the top of the page, the new policy doesn’t go into effect until September 29th, 2023.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>IBM has returned to the facial recognition market — just three years after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21284683/ibm-no-longer-general-purpose-facial-recognition-analysis-software">announcing it was abandoning work on the technology</a> due to concerns about racial profiling, mass surveillance, and other human rights violations.</p><p>In June 2020, as Black Lives Matter protests swept the US after George Floyd’s murder, IBM chief executive Arvind Krishna <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200609031426/https:/www.ibm.com/blogs/policy/facial-recognition-susset-racial-justice-reforms/">wrote a letter to Congress</a> announcing that the company would no longer offer “general purpose” facial recognition technology. “The fight against racism is as urgent as ever,” he wrote. “IBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which is not consistent with our values and Principles of Trust and Transparency.” Later that year, the company redoubled its commitment, calling for US export controls to address concerns that facial recognition could be used overseas “to suppress dissent, to infringe on the rights of minorities, or to erase basic expectations of privacy.”</p><p>Despite these announcements, last month, IBM signed a $69.8 million (£54.7 million) contract with the British government to develop a national biometrics platform that will offer a facial recognition function to immigration and law enforcement officials, according to documents reviewed by <em>The Verge</em> and <a href="https://libertyinvestigates.org.uk/">Liberty Investigates</a>, an investigative journalism unit in the UK.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.find-tender.service.gov.uk/Notice/021422-2023?origin=SearchResults&amp;p=1">contract notice</a> for the Home Office Biometrics Matcher Platform outlines how the project initially involves developing a fingerprint matching capability, while later stages introduce facial recognition for immigration purposes — described as “an enabler for strategic facial matching for law enforcement.” The final stage of the project is described as delivery of a “facial matching for law enforcement use-case.”</p><div><p>The Home Office Biometrics Matcher Platform includes “strategic” matching of photos in a database</p></div><p>The platform will allow photos of individuals to be matched against images stored on a database — what is sometimes known as a “one-to-many” matching system. In September 2020, IBM described such “one-to-many” matching systems as “the type of facial recognition technology most likely to be used for mass surveillance, racial profiling, or other violations of human rights.”</p><p>IBM spokesman Imtiaz Mufti denied that its work on the contract was in conflict with its 2020 commitments. “IBM no longer offers general-purpose facial recognition and, consistent with our 2020 commitment, does not support the use of facial recognition for mass surveillance, racial profiling, or other human rights violations,” he said.</p><p>“The Home Office Biometrics Matcher Platform and associated Services contract is not used in mass surveillance. It supports police and immigration services in identifying suspects against a database of fingerprint and photo data. It is not capable of video ingest, which would typically be needed to support face-in-a-crowd biometric usage.”</p><p>Human rights campaigners, however, said IBM’s work on the project is incompatible with its 2020 commitments. Kojo Kyerewaa of Black Lives Matter UK said: “IBM has shown itself willing to step over the body and memory of George Floyd to chase a Home Office contract. This won’t be forgotten.”</p><p>Matt Mahmoudi, PhD, tech researcher at Amnesty International, said: “The research across the globe is clear; there is no application of one-to-many facial recognition that is compatible with human rights law, and companies — including IBM — must therefore cease its sale, and honor their earlier statements to sunset these tools, even and especially in the context of law and immigration enforcement where the rights implications are compounding.”</p><div><p>“There is no application of one-to-many facial recognition that is compatible with human rights law.”</p></div><p>Police use of facial recognition has been linked to wrongful arrests in the US and has been challenged in the UK courts. In 2019, an independent report on the London Metropolitan Police Service’s use of live facial recognition found there was no “explicit legal basis” for the force’s use of the technology and raised concerns that it may have breached human rights law. In August of the following year, the UK’s Court of Appeal ruled that South Wales Police’s use of facial recognition technology breached privacy rights and broke equality laws. The force paused its use of facial recognition after the verdict but has since resumed using the technology.</p><p>Other tech firms have imposed partial bans on the use of their facial recognition services for law enforcement. In the days after IBM declared its plans to leave the facial recognition sector, Amazon and Microsoft both announced moratoriums on the sale of their facial recognition services to police departments in the US.</p><p>Amazon initially announced a one-year moratorium on police use of its Rekognition software in June 2020 and said it would be extending the ban “indefinitely” the following year. A spokeswoman for the company confirmed that the moratorium, which prohibits “use of Amazon Rekognition’s face comparison feature by police departments in connection with criminal investigations,” is still in place.</p><p>Microsoft said in June 2020 that it would not sell facial recognition software to US police departments until a national law is introduced governing use of the technology. When contacted by <em>The Verge</em> and Liberty Investigates, a spokeswoman for Microsoft referred to the company’s website, which states that use of the Azure AI Face service “by or for state or local police in the US is prohibited by Microsoft policy.”&nbsp;</p><p>The UK Home Office did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <div><p><span><strong>MINNEAPOLIS/ST. PAUL (08/22/2023) —</strong>A team of University of Minnesota Medical School researchers successfully tested a new antifungal therapy to treat fungal meningitis. The trial results were published today in the peer-reviewed journal </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciad440/7246927?searchresult=1"><span>Clinical Infectious Diseases</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The research team tested a new oral formulation of the antifungal medication amphotericin among people who had HIV and cryptococcal meningitis—a common fungal infection around the brain. Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common cause of central nervous system infection in people living with HIV worldwide. Conventional amphotericin B can only be administered directly into veins and is highly toxic. The new lipid nanocrystal formulation—which was tested in the EnACT trial—can be taken orally and is non-toxic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“An orally administered amphotericin that is effective against nearly all fungus and non-toxic sounds like the holy grail of antifungal medicines. While further clinical trials are needed in other fungal conditions, the EnACT trial establishes proof of concept for the safe and effective treatment of invasive fungal infections,” said </span><a href="https://med.umn.edu/bio/david-boulware"><span>David Boulware</span></a><span>, MD, MPH, an infectious disease physician and professor at the University of Minnesota Medical School and M Health Fairview. Dr. Boulware is also the senior investigator of the EnACT trial.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In this randomized trial, 141 HIV-positive people with cryptococcal meningitis received the oral amphotericin combined with oral flucytosine. This combination was found to be promising for cryptococcal meningitis in regard to antifungal activity, similar survival and less toxicity in comparison to intravenous amphotericin B. Statistically fewer lab abnormalities occurred with the six weeks of LNC-enabled oral amphotericin B compared to one week of intravenous amphotericin B. In the group given two IV loading doses then the experimental oral amphotericin formulation, 90% of participants survived &gt;4 months compared to 85% who received one week of standard intravenous amphotericin.</span></p><p><span>“With the rising incidence of life-threatening fungal infections, our currently available conventional methods are limited by rising rates of drug resistance and toxicities,” said </span><a href="https://med.umn.edu/bio/mahsa-abassi"><span>Mahsa Abassi</span></a><span>, DO, assistant professor at the U of M Medical School and co-investigator on the trial. “The development of new antifungal regimens that are orally available, less toxic, and can treat highly resistant fungal infections is crucial.”</span></p><p><span>The trial was conducted in partnership with researchers from the U of M’s Medical School,&nbsp; School of Public Health, the Infectious Diseases Institute of Makerere University in Uganda and Matinas BioPharma, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“We are very pleased that the important EnACT data are being shared with the clinical and scientific community at large through publication in this peer-reviewed journal,” said Theresa Matkovits, PhD, and Chief Development Officer of Matinas. “The results from EnACT in cryptococcal meningitis and our experience with patients enrolled in our ongoing Compassionate/Expanded Use Access Program support our belief that MAT2203 has the potential to become an important part of the regimen for treatment of invasive fungal infections, including in the highest-need patients who require longer-term treatment and have limited or no treatment options.&nbsp; The publication of the EnACT data in Clinical Infectious Diseases is yet another milestone for our development program. We would like to thank all the EnACT participants, our dedicated investigators, and the entire clinical study team in Uganda for their commitment to this important clinical trial.”</span></p><p><span>Funding for the EnACT trial was provided by the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>###</span></p><p><span><strong>About the University of Minnesota Medical School</strong></span></p><p><span>The University of Minnesota Medical School is at the forefront of learning and discovery, transforming medical care and educating the next generation of physicians. Our graduates and faculty produce high-impact biomedical research and advance the practice of medicine. </span><a href="https://med.umn.edu/odei/about/commitments-acknowledgements"><span>We acknowledge</span></a><span> that the U of M Medical School, both the Twin Cities campus and Duluth campus, is located on traditional, ancestral and contemporary lands of the Dakota and the Ojibwe, and scores of other Indigenous people, and we affirm our commitment to tribal communities and their sovereignty as we seek to improve and strengthen our relations with tribal nations.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/30/usenet_revival/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/30/usenet_revival/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37336606">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The USENET management committee has reconvened and there are green shoots of growth in the original, pre-World Wide Web social network.</p>
<p>USENET, or NetNews, is a text-only social discussions forum, or rather a set of a great many forums, called "newsgroups," carried by multiple servers around the world. Although the original developers <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2010/05/20/usenet_duke_server/">closed down</a> their instance in 2010, that was just one server out of hundreds, and many are still running just fine. It never went away – it's still alive, you can get on it for free, and there is a choice of client apps for most OSes to help you navigate.</p>
<p>Although USENET is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network, the Big-8 board is the closest thing it has to a central governing authority. Board member <a target="_blank" href="https://www.big-8.org/wiki/User:Tristan_Miller" rel="nofollow">Tristan Miller</a> told <em>The Reg</em>: "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.big-8.org/wiki/User:Jason_Evans" rel="nofollow">Jason Evans</a> and I <a target="_blank" href="https://www.big-8.org/wiki/Press_releases/2020-11" rel="nofollow">re-established the Board</a> in 2020, after a long period of dormancy. We were joined a few months later by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.big-8.org/wiki/User:Rayner_Lucas" rel="nofollow">Rayner Lucas</a>."</p>

    

<p>Among other things, the board manages the list of newsgroups, and now that there's an active board again, it has been busy. It deleted some very old groups at the moderators' request, and added the first new newsgroup in many years for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/27/gemini_protocol/">the Gemini protocol</a>. If you have a News client, news:comp.infosystems.gemini ought to open it. The board has also revamped the website, run a Reddit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nn4vp8/were_the_usenet_big8_management_board_ask_us/" rel="nofollow">Ask Me Anything session</a>, updated the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.algebra.com/~ichudov/stump/" rel="nofollow">GNU Stump</a> and WebStump packages used by moderators, and more.</p>

        


        

<p>USENET is older than the web, and works more like email: servers carry a list of newsgroups, and sync messages with each other. Although the original developers <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2010/05/20/usenet_duke_server/">closed down</a> their instance in 2010, that was just one server out of hundreds.</p>
<p>(One of the things that contributed to the downfall of USENET was when people worked out how to post binary files, encoded as multi-part blocks of ASCII text.

<p>Getting online is pretty easy. Get an account on a USENET server. Install a client, tell it the server address. Download the list of groups, subscribe to some, and new messages get delivered to your client. That's it.</p>
<p><em>The Reg</em> FOSS desk uses a service called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eternal-september.org/" rel="nofollow">Eternal September</a>, after the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September" rel="nofollow">event</a> when AOL added USENET access to its internet client and tens of thousands of newbies flooded in without knowing the rules. We'll give you one hint: scrupulously follow the "netiquette" of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/23/email_like_a_pro/">plain-text, bottom-posted email</a>.</p>

        

<p>Eternal September only carries text groups, no binaries, but it offers totally free accounts, whereas some higher-capacity servers such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eweka.nl/en" rel="nofollow">Eweka</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://giganews.com/" rel="nofollow">Giganews</a> charge for access.</p>
<p>As for a client – well, as we mentioned <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/26/new_betas_of_firefox_and_tbird/">when introducing their new ESR versions</a>, we use Thunderbird. It's free, it works, and it runs on all the big desktop OSes. There are lots out there, though. Even <a target="_blank" href="https://groups.google.com/" rel="nofollow">Google Groups</a> is still alive, if woefully neglected.</p>
<p>As a big science fiction reader, this vulture enjoys dipping into <code>rec.arts.sf.written</code> and <code>rec.arts.sf.fandom</code>. The computer history group <code>alt.folklore.computers</code> is still pretty busy. There is life in several retrocomputing channels, and we've been enjoying talking about Acorn RISC OS and Fortran among other things. ®</p>

							<p>India recently achieved a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/23/1195411957/india-joins-an-elite-club-as-first-to-land-a-spacecraft-near-the-moons-south-pol">space exploration milestone</a> by becoming the first nation to land a rover on the Moon’s mysterious south pole. The ambitious <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/Chandrayaan3_Details.html">Chandrayaan-3</a> mission’s rover <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragyan_(rover)">Pragyan</a> has begun using its onboard instruments to study this unexplored frontier up close. Early results reveal the rover’s groundbreaking capabilities to analyze lunar soil composition, with potential implications for discovering frozen water.</p>
<p>Pragyan’s instruments are unlocking clues about the elemental makeup of the lunar surface near the south pole. A specialized <a href="https://appliedspectra.com/technology/libs.html">Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy</a> (LIBS) tool became the first equipment to ever perform in-situ measurements of this region’s composition. By shooting intense laser pulses at the soil, LIBS can induce plasma emissions that identify elemental signatures.</p>
<p>ISRO announced the rover’s LIBS results definitively confirm the <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/LIBSResults.html">presence of sulfur</a> at the landing site. Additionally, preliminary scans detect traces of aluminum, iron, calcium, chromium, titanium, manganese, silicon, and oxygen in the soil. Further hydrogen detection efforts are underway.</p>
<p>These atomic ingredients offer initial glimpses into the south pole’s geological story. LIBS provides a versatile technique to chemically analyze alien soils faster than traditional sample returns.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.livemint.com/science/news/chandrayaan3-what-happens-to-vikram-lander-and-pragyan-rover-after-14-days-heres-what-you-should-know-11692854593821.html">Pragyan’s two-week surface mission</a> will continue employing LIBS and other tools to scan for water ice deposits thought to exist in the permanently shadowed craters of the south pole. Finding accessible water sources could benefit future lunar habitation and deep space exploration.</p>
<p>India overcame <a href="https://www.theweek.in/news/sci-tech/2019/11/16/how-did-chandrayaan-2-fail-isro-answer.html">past setbacks</a> to achieve this south pole milestone. The country boldly envisions Chandrayaan-3 inaugurating an ambitious lunar exploration program. With the rover already making history through its technical innovations, India’s lunar dreams appear brighter than ever.</p>

<p>NASA officials sounded an alarm Tuesday about the agency's Deep Space Network, a collection of antennas in California, Spain, and Australia used to maintain contact with missions scattered across the Solar System.</p>
<p>Everything from NASA's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/nasa-leader-warns-agency-needs-more-funding-to-fly-artemis-missions/">Artemis missions to the Moon</a> to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/08/voyager-2-phones-home-and-says-everything-is-cool/">Voyager probes in interstellar space</a> rely on the Deep Space Network (DSN) to receive commands and transmit data back to Earth. Suzanne Dodd, who oversees the DSN in her position at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, likes to highlight the network's importance by showing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/07/the-webb-telescope-just-offered-a-revelatory-view-of-humanitys-distant-past/">gorgeous images from missions like the James Webb Space Telescope</a> and the Perseverance rover on Mars.</p>
<p>"All these images, and all these great visuals for the public, and all the science for the scientists come down through the Deep Space Network," Dodd said Tuesday in a meeting of the NASA Advisory Council's Science Committee.</p>
<h2>DSN is in deep&nbsp;sh!#</h2>
<p>But Dodd doesn't take a starry-eyed view of the challenges operating the Deep Space Network. She said there are currently around 40 missions that rely on the DSN's antennas to stay in communication with controllers and scientists back on Earth. Another 40-plus missions will join the roster over the next decade or so, and many of the 40 missions currently using time on the network will likely still be operating over that time.</p>
<p>"We have more missions coming than we currently are flying," Dodd said. "We’re nearly doubling the load on the DSN. A lot of those are either lunar exploration or Artemis missions, and a lot of Artemis precursor missions with commercial vendors. So the load is increasing, and it’s very stressful to us.”</p>
<p>“It’s oversubscribed, yet it’s vital to anything the agency wants to do," she said.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/01/vint-cerf-internet-competition-has-evaporated-since-dial-up/">Vint Cerf</a>, an Internet pioneer who is now an executive at Google, sits on the committee Dodd met with Tuesday. After hearing from Dodd and other NASA managers, Cerf said: "The deep space communications system is in deep—well, let me use a better word, deficit. There’s a four-letter word that occurs to me, too."</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1158020682.jpg" data-height="1000" data-width="1500" alt="An antenna at NASA's Deep Space Network station near Madrid."><img alt="An antenna at NASA's Deep Space Network station near Madrid." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1158020682-640x427.jpg" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1158020682-1280x853.jpg 2x"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1158020682.jpg" data-height="1000" data-width="1500">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> An antenna at NASA's Deep Space Network station near Madrid.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because astronauts are involved, the Artemis missions will come with unique requirements on the DSN.</p>
<p>"We're not going to have bits of data. We're going to have gigabits of data," said Philip Baldwin, acting director of the network services division at JPL. "I don't want 1080p for video resolution. I want 8K video."</p>
<p>Each of the three stations on the Deep Space Network has a 70-meter (230-foot) dish antenna, the largest antennas in the world for deep space communications. Each location also has at least three 112-foot (34-meter) antennas. The oldest of the large antennas in California entered service in 1966, then was enlarged to its 70-meter diameter in 1988.</p>
<p>“We have reached a really critical point on the DSN’s aging infrastructure," said Sandra Cauffman, deputy director of NASA's astrophysics division.</p>
<h2>Artemis I case study</h2>
<p>Dodd presented some numbers from late last year to highlight the problem. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/12/after-decades-of-false-starts-nasa-really-is-returning-to-the-moon-this-time/">During the Artemis I mission</a>, NASA's Orion spacecraft spent about 25 days traveling from Earth to a distant orbit around the Moon, then returned to a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. The Deep Space Network's antennas collectively spent 903 hours tracking and communicating with the Orion spacecraft during Artemis I.</p>
<p>But there's more to the story. There were 10 small rideshare secondary payloads that flew into deep space on the Space Launch System rocket on Artemis I. These CubeSats ranged in size from a shoebox to a briefcase, with small antennas and low-power transmitters that required large antennas on Earth to make a reliable connection.</p>
<p>Eight of these CubeSats were tracked with the DSN, according to Dodd. "They got 871 hours of tracking, nearly as much as Artemis for eight little CubeSats," she said.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure who thought it was a good idea to put up (so many) CubeSats with Artemis I," Dodd said.</p>

The unbundling is largely targeted at enterprises, as Microsoft will keep bundling Teams in its Microsoft 365 Business plans that are offered to small businesses. Microsoft will also offer a no Teams option, priced at €1 less per month for the Business Basic plan or €2 less per month for Business Standard or Premium plans.</p><p>Alongside the Teams unbundling, Microsoft is also planning to improve its documentation on interoperability with Microsoft 365 and Office 365 for rivals like Zoom and Slack to integrate into Exchange, Outlook, and Teams.

Slack alleged that Microsoft had “illegally tied” its Microsoft Teams product to Office and is “force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers.” </p><p>Microsoft will now have to wait on EU regulators to decide whether its unbundling of Teams from Office suites in EU markets is enough. “We believe these changes balance the interests of our competitors with those of European business customers, providing them with access to the best possible solutions at competitive prices,” says Linde. “We also recognize that we are still in the early stages of the European Commission’s formal investigation. We will continue to engage with the Commission, listen to concerns in the marketplace, and remain open to exploring pragmatic solutions that benefit both customers and developers in Europe.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

		<p><span>I</span><span>t is</span>, in fact, possible to have a decent time on Goodreads. You just have to ignore everything about the way the site is designed and how you’re supposed to use it. When I first signed up in early 2012, I obeyed all the prompts. I populated my “to-read” shelf with the platform’s recommendations. I followed the pages of my favourite writers, as if Nabokov and Kafka were going to start posting updates. I papered my profile with quotes by Sigmund Freud and Philip Roth and deadpanned that my favourite books were simply “the big ones.” I didn’t mind all the beige, the slowness of the search feature, the sense that, if I turned around too quickly, I might catch the platform taking a nap. The site catered to my undergraduate hunger for pretension, my need to perform my taste—a flame it continues to fan very capably in its users.</p>

<p>Gradually, things started to go off the rails. My to-read list ballooned alarmingly, not from titles I felt drawn to out of genuine desire but ones the algorithm pushed on me. The thrill of discovery, too, felt compromised: every time my feed told me a friend had added a book that I’d found first, I felt a frisson of annoyance. <em>Have some imagination</em>. Then, after I posted a review of a recently published novel, the author reached out to thank me for it. I froze. The review had been positive, but that wasn’t the point—I thought this was a private party, not the town square. There were <em>writers</em> here? Just hanging around and <em>watching</em> us? The pressure to moderate my ratings for an invisible audience was immediate. It was one thing to show off for my friends; this felt like a reminder that the stakes were people’s livelihoods. It was my first hint that Goodreads wasn’t—or wasn’t only—a place for readers to gather and connect. It was trying to cater to authors and publishers too—groups whose priorities are very different.</p>

<p>On the surface, Goodreads seems to have mission clarity. It bills itself as “the world’s largest site for readers and book recommendations” and frames its function as one of community making: “to help people find and share <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/category/books/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">books</a> they love” (though recent headlines would suggest it’s closer to the opposite). In practice, Goodreads is great for many things, but none of them includes what it’s ostensibly “for.” I still use the site daily—but only because I abandoned that first profile and set up a second, anonymous one that ignores its purpose as a social network. Instead, I use it to get a rough and ready sense of how a book might be selling based on the number of ratings and the speed at which they accrue. I use it to drop five stars on upcoming books by friends, giving their work a tiny boost in a landscape where a book can live or die based on hype. I use it to check when a paperback edition comes out or to see which country got the better cover design. In exchange, I accept that parts of the site randomly vanish between desktop and mobile, or that a single typo while looking for a book makes the search function collapse, or that, some days, it decides <em>audiobook</em> is the only format in existence. </p>
<p>The awfulness of the user experience is surprising, given Amazon’s purchase of Goodreads in 2013. The acquisition had the potential to make the platform a major channel for book sales and marketing, though consensus seems to be that Amazon has largely abandoned it. The resulting site and its splintering purposes often feel incoherent. As an experience, it’s not entirely clear who it’s for, where its responsibilities lie, and what its function should be in a rapidly changing literary ecosystem. But despite the site’s muddied purposes and tendency to breed controversy, the book industry is still dependent on it, even beholden to it. As books coverage declines and marketing budgets shrink, Goodreads offers a rare way to get a title in front of a huge audience—approximately 90 million users—of self-selecting readers. It runs buzzy giveaway campaigns, author interviews, and lists rounding up the season’s biggest books. All these features are aimed at getting a fraction of those 90 million readers to click that prized “to-read” button, a crude prediction of that book’s future in the marketplace.</p>
<p>With so many stakeholders aiming to drive up the number of reviews, the genre of the review itself takes on an outsize significance. Much has been written about the practice of “review bombing”—when users flood a forthcoming book with one-star reviews out of an agenda rather than textual engagement. The point isn’t for people to talk smack about a book they didn’t like but to hurt the fate of one they probably haven’t read and that probably isn’t out yet. Goodreads’ lack of content moderation, and the ensuing capacity to spook authors into decisive action, has been a problem for at least four years. It was an issue in 2019, at the peak of the conversation about sensitivity readers, when a number of authors delayed or pulled their books because reader reviews criticized them for cultural misrepresentations. It was an issue again in June this year, when <em>Eat, Pray, Love</em> author Elizabeth Gilbert <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/12/1181714943/elizabeth-gilbert-halts-new-book-release-russia-ukraine" rel="noopener" target="_blank">decided to indefinitely delay</a> her new book’s publication after Goodreads users objected to a <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/russia/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Russia</a>-set book following the country’s invasion of <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/ukraine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ukraine</a>. Though Goodreads told the <em>New York Times</em> it has improved its process for flagging “suspicious reviews” and “taken steps to improve its ability to detect and remove content that violates the site’s community guidelines,” it’s obviously still a problem. </p>

<p>When the Gilbert news broke, the headlines were both widespread and familiar. The <em>Times</em> led with “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/26/books/goodreads-review-bombing.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">How Review-Bombing Can Tank a Book before It’s Published</a>.” <em>The Atlantic</em> condemned “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/goodreads-review-bombing-amazon-moderation/674811/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Wrath of Goodreads</a>.” Bestselling author Rebecca F. Kuang—whose latest novel, <em>Yellowface</em>, is a satire about the publishing industry’s own racial insensitivity—wrote in the <em>Guardian</em> that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/25/goodreads-is-right-to-divide-opinions-wrong-to-boil-them-down" rel="noopener" target="_blank">disagreement on the site</a> is “a sign of a lively, healthy reading culture” but problems come when it devolves into simplistic claims of moral righteousness. In a rare piece that centred the experience of the reader rather than the agonies of the writer, Greta Rainbow <a href="https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/books/a44567428/the-gamification-of-reading-is-changing-how-we-approach-books/#" rel="noopener" target="_blank">explored</a> how the site gamifies reading and influences other people’s purchasing behaviours. Controversy, Rainbow argues, only reinforces this goal: “by exerting influence and extracting attention, Goodreads is working exactly as it should.” Running through these pieces like a refrain was the aggrieved affirmation of the site’s importance as a tool for garnering pre-publication buzz.</p>
<p>Given Goodreads’ status as a load-bearing pillar of publicity, it’s surprising that it’s never really taken off as a promotional tool for writers, especially when it explicitly offers the option to be one. Tucked in like an afterthought—not mentioned on the “About” page or in its list of purposes—is the Goodreads Author Program. Stephen King is a member. So is Colleen Hoover. “It rarely ends well when authors barge into spaces meant for readers,” wrote Kuang in the <em>Guardian</em>. In general, she’s right. But, as I was so shocked to discover in 2012, this space is meant to be for authors too—a place where they can set up a profile, do Q&amp;As with their fans, blog, and share their own reading material. </p>
<p>For a site that professes to serve readers and readers alone, having a program where authors can enter the fray seems like it muddies the waters even further. Where the guiding ethos of the “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/guidelines" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Review Philosophy</a>” for users is largely “be honest and have fun,” on the writer’s side, things are more censorious. “The community perceives you as a public figure,” it warns, “and we expect you to act professionally”—a hard pill to swallow if you’re getting review-bombed. Plus, its functionality is just bad. I’ve been trying to sign up since my first book got a retail page, but for whatever reason, every time Goodreads asks me, “Are you Tajja Isen, author of the books below?” and I give all the required documentation, I can never convince it that the answer is yes. </p>
<p>Which leaves me with only one way to relate to the platform as an author: reading reviews about my own work. I’d never dare write to a reader unprompted, even to thank them for saying I changed their life. Or to engage in good faith with one-star Stacy, who called me a “mixed race woman pretending to own African American women’s struggle” [sic]. Believe it or not, in the Wild West of Goodreads, there’s a rule against authors replying to something like that.</p>

                                  <p>Tati Bruening, a 22-year-old content creator and photographer, just wants to share memes and post about cooking green beans. Every time she logs onto Instagram, however, her feed is swamped by a combination of perfectly curated photos and professionally created content.</p><p>"It's really bizarre to me that everyone's gone to this place in their mind that content has to be so curated," Bruening told us. "So curated that you can't show what you're cooking for dinner, because that's not cool enough."&nbsp;</p><p>Frustrated with the state of the platform, Bruening launched the "Make Instagram Instagram Again'' crusade in 2022. Using her handle, Illumitati, the campaign pushed back against the platform's changes that prioritized algorithmically suggested videos over a chronological feed of accounts you follow. Thousands of users, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kylie-jenner-kim-kardashian-instagram-stop-trying-to-be-tiktok-2022-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">even some celebrities like Kylie Jenner</a>, got on board. Soon enough, Instagram scaled back its aggressive recommendations push.&nbsp;</p><p>At the core of Bruening's frustration was a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kim-kardashian-kylie-jenner-smarter-than-mark-zuckerberg-instagram-changes-2022-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">sea change that had swept across Instagram</a>: Instead of everyday photos from regular people, the platform had become a curated platform where even seemingly authentic content was meticulously planned.&nbsp;</p><p>The fatigue average people feel when it comes to posting on Instagram has pushed more users toward private posting and closed groups. Features like Close Friends (a private list of people who have access to your content) and the rise of group chats give people a safer place to share memes, gossip with friends, and even meet new people. It's less pressure — <em>they won't mind if I didn't blur out the pimple on my forehead</em> — but this side of Instagram hardly fulfills the original free-flowing&nbsp; promise of social media.</p><p>"There's this very weird, unspoken social standard of what's allowed on Instagram," Bruening said. "I know that for my age group, it's like you give up on it entirely, and then you just post only to your Close Friends or alternate accounts. There's this sublayer of Instagram that's much more true to what the app once was, but it is just not viewable to the general public."</p><p>Bruening isn't alone. Despite the efforts of big incumbents and buzzy new apps, the old ways of posting are gone, and people don't want to go back. Even <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagrams-adam-mosseri-spills-on-podcast-threads-creator-monetization-dms-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, admitted</a> that users have moved on to direct messages, closed communities, and group chats. Regularly posting content is now largely confined to content creators and influencers, while non-creators are moving toward sharing bits of their lives behind private accounts.</p><p>As more people have been confronted with the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/entrepreneur-mental-health-social-media-instagram-tiktok-2022-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">consequences of constant sharing</a>, social media has become less social and more media — a constellation of entertainment platforms where users consume content but rarely, if ever, create their own. Influencers, marketers, average users, and even social-media executives agree: Social media, as we once knew it, is dead.</p><h2><strong><em>Social</em></strong><strong> media to social </strong><strong><em>media</em></strong></h2><p>No app better defines the changing nature of social media than Instagram. The app started as a digital scrapbook — a place to keep up with real-world connections, close friends, and family. While other networks had more users (Facebook) or generated more news (Twitter), <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-app-how-it-looked-at-launch-2010-2019-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Instagram seemed to define</a> the ideal form of this era of social media. Instagram became a verb, an aesthetic, and a generational signifier.</p><p>"You sort of end up in this world that is beautiful and you are following your friends and following your family," Jeffrey Gerson, a former Instagram product-marketing manager, told us about the early days of the app. "How often do you get the chance to see the world through your second cousin's eyes?"</p><p>But as Instagram grew up, things began to change. Sarah Frier, a Bloomberg tech reporter and editor and the author of "No Filter," which chronicles the history of Instagram, wrote that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21506016/instagram-10-year-anniversary-sarah-frier-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">users learned curation</a> from the introduction of photo filters. After filters and editing tools came hashtags, an explore tab, and the option to privately save people's photos. What was once an enjoyable pastime became a minefield of considerations: What should I say in the caption? Are emojis still cool? Is it better to just stay mysterious and let the images speak for themselves? This running list of questions made the posting process overwhelming, robbing Instagram of its early magic.</p><blockquote><q>There's this very weird, unspoken social standard of what's allowed on Instagram.</q></blockquote><p>As posting became higher stakes, new features also pushed users away from the original mission: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-data-reveals-how-instagram-reels-photos-compare-engagement-reach-2022-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Instagram began prioritizing video</a>, then livestreaming, and then shopping. Each change muddled the purpose of Instagram even further. Everyday people were still posting to the platform, but more and more of the content became professionalized. Bloggers brought their audience, editing skills, and expensive cameras to the platform. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-do-instagram-influencers-make-money" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Influencers started to snag brand deals</a>, and fashion bloggers made the platform into a career. Instagram encouraged the rise of influencers with programs that helped creators understand best practices, gave them technical support, and set up discreet payment programs.</p><p>Today, the app has become an aspirational entertainment app — a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-influencers-are-key-to-social-commerce-shopping-2021-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">place where users can shop</a>, find information, and get inspired (or, more commonly, overwhelmed) by snapshots of the best moments of a person's life. Nearly every photo on Instagram now is hand selected from an album of dozens of nearly identical images. The only difference is the one you're seeing isn't too perfect but just perfect enough for sharing. These shifts had a downstream effect on everyday users: The cadence of posting content changed. "Your friends don't post that much to feed," Mosseri admitted during a recent interview on the "20VC" podcast.&nbsp;</p><p>Hannah Stowe, a 23-year-old who lives in New York, said that while she uses Instagram every day, she rarely finds herself posting these days. "I used to post on Instagram weekly/bimonthly, but now it's much less frequent, like four or five times a year," she told us in a DM. "I add stories more impulsively but way less than I used to. Now it's probably like once a week. If that."</p><p>While sharing has tailed off, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-surpasses-instagram-time-spent-us-adults-emarketer-8-2023" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">consuming content hasn't slowed</a>, especially since the start of the pandemic, Andrea Casanova, an influencer strategist, told us. When people were confined to their homes, the apps saw an influx of photos "from people who either have a specific lifestyle or had specific talents," she said. This, in turn, reinforces typical people's decision to not post on their own feeds, Casanova said, because they assume the bar for what people want to see is higher.</p><p>"Culture in general has kept a lot of people from showing up because they don't think their life is aesthetic, or they don't think that they're selling anything, so why would they post on social media? 'I just don't have the lifestyle that all of these creators have, so I don't know what I would be sharing' and therefore fall into this loop of never sharing anything," Casanova said.</p><p>As users post less and less to Instagram, new apps have tried to stake their claim as the next big thing. The French social-media app BeReal, which gained popularity for its more authentic experience, peaked at 75 million downloads per analytics firm Sensor Tower and a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bereal-buzzy-gen-z-social-media-app-raise-630m-valuation-2022-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">$630 million</a> valuation. Growth has stalled a year later, with a monthly active user base of 51 million, a sliver of Instagram's 1.4 billion. Other apps like Dispo, Poparazzi, and Locket have all used various gimmicks to try and recapture social media's halcyon days — each had a moment in the sun at the top of the US Apple app-store charts — but none have truly broken through. Even ByteDance, which has the same parent company as TikTok, failed to recapture the fading magic with the photo-sharing platform Lemon8.</p><blockquote><q>I'm honestly just tired of social media. I'm tired of consuming content all the time.</q></blockquote><p>And now there is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-instagram-threads-is-destined-to-be-boring-2023-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Threads, Instagram's latest play</a> in the space to fill the void that was left as Twitter has undergone so much volatility. While Mosseri has hailed the text-focused platform as a "less angry place for conversations, " Threads' daily active-user count is down 79% a month after it launched — to 10.3 million daily active users, data from Similarweb found. Even with the backing of Meta, Threads may not have the juice to make it through, because it doesn't offer users a new way to interact. It follows in the footsteps of other buzzy startups that rise to the top for weeks, even days, before users get bored. The core issue is that these apps don't solve anything new. They are mostly copycat versions of each other.&nbsp;</p><p>"People are looking for that 'groundbreaking app,' and we still haven't gotten that yet," Casanova said.</p><h2><strong>It's going down in the DMs</strong></h2><p>In an era where a lot of frequent social-media users are sick of being "<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkbpk7/its-normal-to-feel-anxious-about-being-seen-and-perceived-after-covid-pandemic-v28n2" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">perceived</a>" and having hundreds, or even thousands, of eyes on them, many are retreating to the days of tighter connections and communities.&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm honestly just tired of social media," said 23-year-old Walid Mohammed, who works in the creator economy. "I'm tired of consuming content all the time."&nbsp;</p><p>And if Instagram was the bellwether for the rise and fall of the "social" social-media era, it is also a harbinger of this new era. "If you look at how teens spend their time on Instagram, they spend more time in DMs than they do in stories, and they spend more time in stories than they do in feed," Mosseri said during the "20VC" interview. Given this changing behavior, Mosseri said the platform has shifted its resources to messaging tools. "Actually, at one point a couple years ago, I think I put the entire stories team on messaging," he said.&nbsp;</p><p>These closed spaces aren't just more private than the Instagrams and TikToks of social media, however — they also offer something algorithms can't serve: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/discords-website-for-videogaming-and-sneaker-reselling-cook-group-hub-2020-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">niche communities</a>.</p><p>"You have this really interesting countermovement backwards into these much smaller and much more hyper-specific communities," said Gerson, who recently has helped grow Castro Labs, a queer social-media startup.</p><p>That opens the door for new apps that can capitalize on the more direct sharing preferences of the younger generation. Discord, for instance, has grown to nearly 170 million monthly average users — it could even be on a path to an IPO. Other, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/geneva-vs-clubhouse-discord-chat-app-gen-z-users-creators-2022-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">smaller apps such as Geneva</a> have also provided new ways to connect with people locally or with similar interests. For instance, the content creator Nina Haines launched a group called SapphLit, a self-described "sapphic book club born out of the queer BookTok community."</p><p>Victoria Johnston, a 22-year-old software engineer, imagines the ideal social-media platform as a "safe space where people can just connect and you don't feel pressured to have a big following or a presence or be really well known." Johnston, like many others, wants to go beyond a screen. She wants a social network that helps her find community in her everyday life.</p><p>"On a space like Geneva or any kind of group networking or chatting app, you're just trying to connect with people with like-minded backgrounds and you're not trying to prove anything to anyone," Johnston said. "You're really just finding those niche communities that you probably wouldn't be able to find on a major social-media app."</p><p>And as more users and creator communities migrate toward closed spaces, the behemoths like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-testing-group-profiles-collaborate-creators-2022-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Instagram are also trying to capitalize</a> on this reality by introducing features like paid-subscription services that offer exclusive group chats.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><q>You have this really interesting countermovement backwards into these much smaller and much more hyper-specific communities.</q></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/creator-economy-influencer-marketing-experts-to-follow-linkedin-newsletters-podcasts-2023-5#lia-haberman-is-a-college-professor-who-writes-a-weekly-newsletter-breaking-down-the-latest-influencer-marketing-news-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Lia Haberman,</a> an adjunct professor at UCLA Extension and an advisor for the American Influencer Council, said that Gen Alpha, the age cohort of 13 and younger, are "not embracing traditional social-media platforms and customs." This presents a problem for influencers and brands, since smaller, more direct spaces are harder to penetrate.</p><p>"How does a brand show up in somebody's DMs or Discord server if they're not invited?" Haberman said. But in many ways, that's the point. People can still go on Instagram to check on their favorite celebrities and influencers, but young people don't want brands and marketers infiltrating the closed communities where they spend most of their time.</p><p>Social media promised to create an intricate web that brought us all closer to one another, but the wave of exposure led to an openness that many people just aren't interested in. Most people wouldn't let the first person they stop on the street sift through their camera roll. They want their achievements, failures, and little life moments to be kept sacred. So after a decade of airing our most intimate moments in public, the pendulum is shifting back. People are more selective with their communities and are reverting back to an old-school way of interacting. It's hard to know how the change will affect the online atmosphere over the long term — some evidence suggests the shift will <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/social-media-twitter-facebook-political-polarization-mechanism-2022-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">create a healthier digital experience</a>, but it also risks further dividing people into like-minded echo chambers.</p><p>Whatever the result, it's clear that the Instagram era of social media is over and the new era of "authentic" online sharing is emerging — just without an audience.</p><hr><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/amanda-perelli" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Amanda Perelli</a> is a senior creator economy reporter covering social media influencers, advertising and marketing trends for Insider.<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/sydney-bradley" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Sydney Bradley</a> is a senior reporter covering the creator economy, influencers, and tech for Insider.&nbsp;</p></em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div disabled="" sortable="">
          <p dir="auto">FWIW, a while ago I created an MIT-licensed OSS project <a href="https://github.com/paraterraform/para"><code>para</code></a> to manage terraform plugins. If I recall correctly, this was out even before Terraform Registry (TFR) was GA.</p>
<p dir="auto">The idea behind <code>para</code> is to provide greater control over package indices, as well as an option to maintain personal or fully local indices. What it means is that one can use a Github repo to build out a community repo, or each plugin maintainer can provider their own feed which can be referenced on per-project basis.</p>
<p dir="auto">I'd imagine that unless there is way to make things working with TFR [without violating licenses], <code>para</code> can be used as an alternative, or can inspire plugin management system to be built within OpenTF.</p>
<p dir="auto">I haven't used Terraform for a while so IDK if HashiCorp broke the interface used by <code>para</code> (in which case it should be easy to fix <code>para</code>,  or extend OpenTF to provide a new and more convenient integration interface fir plugin management).</p>
<p dir="auto">P.S.: I used FUSE in <code>para</code> to inject TF-compatible file structures and plugin contents in runtime to avoid need for extra configuration, but in retrospective a FUSE-less mode powered by an additional config file to pre-load plugins would've been a great addition. This one you would only need to invoke <code>para</code> once to rebuild TF plugin dir whenever you need to change/update plugin versions, rather than on every invocation.</p>
<p dir="auto">P.P.S.: Pun intended in a form of "para-terraform," as in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Paraterraforming involves the construction of a habitable enclosure on a planet which eventually grows to encompass most of the planet's usable area.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">UTM SE</h2>
<p dir="auto">UTM/QEMU requires dynamic code generation (JIT) for maximum performance. JIT on iOS devices require either a jailbroken device, or one of the various workarounds found for specific versions of iOS (see "Install" for more details).</p>
<p dir="auto">UTM SE ("slow edition") uses a <a href="https://github.com/ktemkin/qemu/blob/with_tcti/tcg/aarch64-tcti/README.md">threaded interpreter</a> which performs better than a traditional interpreter but still slower than JIT. This technique is similar to what <a href="https://github.com/ish-app/ish">iSH</a> does for dynamic execution. As a result, UTM SE does not require jailbreaking or any JIT workarounds and can be sideloaded as a regular app.</p>
<p dir="auto">To optimize for size and build times, only the following architectures are included in UTM SE: ARM, PPC, RISC-V, and x86 (all with both 32-bit and 64-bit variants).</p>

But with the crypto world crashing that spring, the stock never took off. Within months, Applied Blockchain pivoted again — renaming itself Applied Digital.</p><p>If its previous iteration had been too late to cash in on the bitcoin mining craze, the company wasn’t going to miss the next big one: artificial intelligence.</p>
    

<p>Applied Digital’s stock finally began to soar in May,<b> </b>when CEO Wes Cummins announced that the company had signed a cloud hosting deal potentially worth $180 million with an unnamed but prominent AI customer, and another one for up to $460 million with another big player in the booming AI space. By July, the stock had surged some 450 percent for the year, becoming — for a time, at least — one of the big winners in today’s AI-driven stock market.</p><div data-category-uppercase="true" data-sponsored="true"><a aria-label="Alpha Opportunities in Emerging Markets" href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/2c1111olwhbe42u6talfk/innovation/alpha-opportunities-in-emerging-markets" data-cms-ai="0"><picture>

<p>Applied Digital is hardly alone in trying to capture some AI magic. Ever since ChatGPT burst onto the scene last November — with its “large language model” boasting a humanlike writing capability that at first blush seems to ensure productivity gains for everyone from publishers and movie studios to investment banks and hedge funds — so-called “generative AI” has turned the markets on their heads.</p>
    

<p>Coming off the worst year in recent history for venture capitalists, private market players like Andreessen Horowitz, Coatue Management, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital, and Softbank quickly redirected their dollars to AI upstarts. Meanwhile, the stock prices of the big tech names suspected to be the major beneficiaries of this often-called “revolutionary” form of artificial intelligence have skyrocketed. The 2022 tech downturn became a faint memory as some five tech companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia — accounted for the lion’s share of the stock market’s remarkable comeback this year, with the S&amp;P 500 rising 20 percent through July. Nvidia, maker of the superfast chips that switched from powering bitcoin mining to making generative AI possible, has gained more than 250 percent so far in 2023, making it the S&amp;P index’s top gainer.</p><p>In the midst of this bonanza, Applied Digital’s CEO — who is also the president of B. Riley Asset Management and was at one point the owner of about 25 percent<b> </b>of Applied Digital’s shares — posted on Twitter (now X) in June that the company had ordered 26,000<b> </b>top-tier H100 GPUs, or video processing cards, from Nvidia for $40,000 apiece. To those casting a wary eye on the company, it seemed too good to be true. A purchase that big would allow Applied Digital to “jump to the top of the pile in high-performance computing, alongside Google, Meta, and [Amazon Web Services],” short-seller Dan David said in a Wolfpack Research report that called the company “an embarrassing and predictable stock promotion.” He noted that the cost to purchase such equipment would run more than $1 billion — more than Applied Digital’s market cap of nearly $600 million. <b> </b></p>
    

<p>“The explosion of interest in AI after the emergence of ChatGPT has predictably attracted the worst promoters and scumbags to peddle fake AI wares to credulous investors,” says David, who claims Applied Digital is one of them. (The company did not respond to a request for comment.)</p><p>Applied Digital is one of nearly a dozen companies that short-sellers have been eyeing this year as questionable beneficiaries of AI mania. The shorts say their antennae are on the alert for even more. But so far, the skeptics are fighting an uphill battle. Short interest is relatively high in several of these stocks, and it’s been costly to bet against them. As of August 25, Applied Digital short-sellers, for example, had placed bets on 19 percent of the outstanding shares of the company. The short-sellers in aggregate are down almost 30 percent this year on the name, having lost about $10 million, says S3 Partners — although those who shorted Applied Digital at or near its peak would have profited.</p>
    

<p>Orso Partners co-founder Nate Koppikar, who is also short Applied Digital, has a term for what he sees going on. He calls the phenomenon “the grift shift” — arguing that companies and venture capital funds have pivoted from their losing crypto and tech bets to cash in on the AI moment.</p><p>All told, generative AI and machine learning start-ups raised about $39.4 billion this year, with $19.4 billion of that in the second quarter, according to PitchBook’s second-quarter Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning Report.</p><p>Though money has been pouring into everything said to be “AI,” a few critics are starting to wonder whether the latest technology is really transformational or merely evolutionary. Meanwhile, large language model problems like “hallucinations,” “drift,” and “degradation” are starting to populate the tech literature, in reference to the various types of errors cropping up in generative AI as studies indicate that the products’ output appears to have worsened over time.</p><p>Some investors are starting to grow antsy. AI has dominated the spotlight this year, but “investors are growing impatient with the lack of revenue growth from generative AI innovators,” says PitchBook. “No longer are big tech stocks going up after new-product or partnership announcements, putting pressure on start-ups to gain traction.”</p><p>Says Koppikar, “This looks like a great market for fraudsters to chase because of the ability to ‘Theranos’ your product” with semifunctional prototypes and claims of AI being used in products that are really just powered by humans. He argues that many of the new AI companies “are complete frauds or will never have scalable revenue models,” adding, “There is going to be a staggering amount of capex burned on AI that goes nowhere.”</p>

    <sh2>
        Last year, Koppikar was one of the first
    </sh2>
 investors to predict the cascading downturn in tech and growth stocks, based in part on the interdependency of the companies. He sees a more extreme version of that interdependency at work here, noting that many of the highly touted AI start-ups are backed by big companies like Nvidia, which needs the start-ups to buy its chips in what Koppikar calls a round-trip move. “The big tech companies are driving this. They fund the start-ups and make them buy products from them. It’s a recycling of cash,” he says.</p><p>For example, CoreWeave, a cloud service start-up, recently announced it is taking out a $2.3 billion collateralized loan backed by Nvidia chips. CoreWeave’s biggest investor<b> </b>is Nvidia, and participants in the debt offering include Magnetar Capital, Blackstone, Coatue, DigitalBridge Credit, BlackRock, PIMCO, and Carlyle Group.</p><p>“Nvidia’s explosive revenue growth really tells us nothing about the future of AI,” Koppikar explains. “It turns out every scammer in America is trying to buy H100 chips right now so that they can say they own them. In 2021, scam companies put Bitcoin on their balance sheets — now the scams have shifted over to putting $40,000 H100s on the balance sheet.”</p><p>Koppikar places Applied Digital, with its big order of Nvidia chips, squarely in that category. The company would seem to be a marginal player in the big-stakes world of AI — except for the fact that two customers it claims to have lined up are among the top-ten AI companies that Bloomberg anointed in late June as “the ones to watch right now.”</p><p>When Applied Digital in May announced a potential deal worth $460 million, it declined to name the customer. But later, CEO Cummins tweeted that both that company and the other client were on the Bloomberg top-ten list. His tweet was followed by a research report from brokerage and investment banking firm Craig-Hallum Capital Group, which handled a $125 million equity offering for Applied Digital in late June, noting that one of the company’s new cloud customers is an “LLM provider based in London.”</p><p>Short-sellers David and Koppikar point out that only one company is both on the Bloomberg list and headquartered in London, and that is Stability AI. Its product, Stable Diffusion — a model that allows users to create images based on a few word prompts — was initially so exciting to investors that the company was able to raise $100 million last October from prominent VCs including Coatue and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Stability AI quickly garnered a valuation of $1 billion.</p><p>But since then, the company’s high-flying status has been tarnished by revelations that founder Emad Mostaque lied about his Oxford University credentials, misled investors, and is burning through cash and losing executives, as outlined in a scathing <i>Forbes</i> article. <s> </s></p><p>David calls Stability AI “one of the most dubious AI start-ups in a field awash with speculative promotions.”</p><p>Adds Koppikar: “It looks like Applied Digital signed up a customer that has no way to deliver anything close to the revenues it’s claiming.” He calls the situation “a cautionary tale for AI.”</p><p>Stability AI did not respond by press time to <i>Institutional Investor</i>’s request for comment. But elsewhere, Mostaque has denied the accusations leveled against him. He has also predicted that AI will be “the biggest bubble of all time” and admitted that it is still in its early stages and “not quite ready” for mass-scale adoption in most industries, including banking.</p><p>On July 14, Applied Digital disclosed its other big AI cloud service customer: Character.ai, a neural language model chatbot application founded by former Google executives that generates humanlike text responses and can participate in “contextual” conversation.</p><p>Both Stability AI and Character.ai go a step beyond the text capabilities of ChatGPT, which many businesses believe can help write emails, summarize 10-Ks, draft legal documents, and even, some argue, offer strategic advice. These two programs are among the new generative AI offerings that add images — or sometimes videos — based on word prompts.</p><p>With Character.ai, users can interact with virtual avatars of celebrities like Taylor Swift and Elon Musk. The downside of the program is apparent on Reddit, where a subreddit called CharacterAI_NSFW gives explicit instructions on “how to sex the bots.” (NSFW stands for “not safe for work.”)</p><p>The subreddit’s advice is straightforward: “You just have to spend time flirting with them and slowly pushing the action forward while the content filter fights you. . . . Once you’ve romanced the bot to the point it actually likes you and is consenting, then you can start sexing it.”</p><p>Koppikar offers a note of caution on the video game–based AI programs. “This won’t be anywhere near as big as people think until they find a way to make it not creepy.”</p><p>In response, a spokesman for Character.ai cited the company’s terms of service, which state that “pornographic content is against our terms of service, and will not be supported at any point in the future.” Meanwhile, Character.ai has posted statistics showing that users have spent more time there, where they can engage with famous or fictional people, than on ChatGPT.</p><p>As of March, the Character.ai start-up was valued at $1 billion, according to PitchBook. Its most prominent backer is Andreessen Horowitz, which once boasted the biggest VC crypto fund. But now that such bets have sputtered, the VC firm has launched a new fund to invest in AI start-ups.</p><p>Not surprisingly, VC heavyweight Marc Andreessen, the firm’s co-founder, has become an effusive cheerleader for AI. In a recent lengthy blogpost titled “Why AI Will Save the World,” he argues that “what AI offers us is the opportunity to profoundly augment human intelligence to make all of these outcomes of intelligence — and many others, from the creation of new medicines to ways to solve climate change to technologies to reach the stars — much, much better from here.”</p><p>Among the benefits, says Andreessen, will be the ability of every child to have an “AI tutor that is infinitely patient, infinitely compassionate, infinitely knowledgeable, infinitely helpful.” In his vision of the future, every business and political leader, scientist, artist, doctor, and inventor will have an AI assistant to help maximize his or her endeavors.</p><p>“In short,” says Andreessen, “anything that people do with their natural intelligence today can be done much better with AI, and we will be able to take on new challenges that have been impossible to tackle without AI, from curing all diseases to achieving interstellar travel.”</p><p>Andreessen’s paean may represent peak AI fever. But right now, it’s about as popular to cast aspersions on the miracles of AI as it was two years ago to dismiss crypto as the future of money, or before that, to criticize SPACs as the preferred way to take a company public.</p><p>But although generative AI may well unleash untold gains for society, it also seems that its benefits could be less exciting than the hype suggests.</p>

        Generative AI has already proved
    </sh2>
<b> </b>to be subject to some peculiar flaws. One is “hallucinations” — the ability of a model to invent facts. In one instance, OpenAi, the company behind ChatGPT, was sued in a Georgia state court by radio host Mike Walters, who claims the ChatGPT tool said he had embezzled money from a special-interest group for which he’d served as a financial officer — which is not true. ChatGPT “published libelous matter” regarding the talk show host, the lawsuit alleges.</p><p>Elsewhere, a Texas judge has banned attorneys from using ChatGPT to create filings without human oversight following an incident in which the program made up court cases.</p><p>OpenAi declined to comment on those cases.</p><p>Ben Dickson, a software engineer and the founder of the blog TechTalks, says that hallucinations are a “serious problem. LLMs are wont to generate plausible text that is not factually correct, such as made-up names of papers and journals.”</p><p>Moreover, there is new research, as well as anecdotal evidence, indicating that ChatGPT’s output has gotten worse, or “drifted,” over time.</p><p>For example, research by Stanford University and UC Berkeley professors looked at ChatGPT’s ability to identify prime numbers. Even with something as straightforward as math, the researchers found that in March, ChatGPT had 84 percent accuracy in identifying prime versus composite numbers, but by June had only 51 percent accuracy performing the same exercise.</p><p>“The findings are a warning about the risks of building applications on top of black-box AI systems like ChatGPT that could produce inconsistent or unpredictable results over time,” Dickson wrote on his blog.<b> “</b>My rule of thumb is ‘Only trust the model when you can verify,’” he told <i>Institutional Investor </i>in an email.</p><p>Outside the halls of academia, users have also noticed problems. As first reported in Business Insider, Peter Yang, a product lead at Roblox, tweeted in May that the model was generating faster outputs but that the quality was worse. When asked on Twitter what questions were the problem, Yang responded, “Just simple questions like making writing more clear and concise and generating ideas.”</p><p>OpenAI has denied there is any degradation in GPT-4’s capabilities. “We make each new version smarter than the previous one,” Peter Welinder, vice president of product and partnerships at OpenAI, tweeted in July. “Current hypothesis: When you use it more heavily, you start noticing issues you didn’t see before.” (Welinder declined <i>II</i>’s request for further comment.)</p><p>Meanwhile, Reuters recently reported that monthly traffic to ChatGPT’s website declined in June for the first time since its launch in November, according to analytics firm Similarweb.</p><p>“ChatGPT trends are ugly: Traffic is down, and interest — measured by Google — is in free fall,” says Koppikar. “This is not the type of trend you see in an exponential growth story at this early stage.” He points out that Facebook, in contrast, showed consistent explosive growth for years.</p><p>“AI isn’t the biggest thing since the internet,” Koppikar says. “It is a cute excuse to buy tech stocks again, though.”</p><p>More recently, Yang tweeted: “I haven’t seen a ‘100 AI tools you can’t miss’ thread in weeks. Have we peaked?”</p>

 are now touting their usage of AI, but many have been employing the technology for years. “These things already exist. It’s machine learning and regression analysis,” says Koppikar. The big difference with generative AI, he notes, is that Nvidia’s latest chips are many times more powerful than the earlier ones, meaning they can do computational analysis much faster.</p><p>Experts in the field agree. “In terms of underlying techniques, ChatGPT is not particularly innovative,” Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief AI scientist, told a group of reporters and business executives on Zoom recently. “It’s nothing revolutionary, although that’s the way it’s perceived in the public,” he said, according to a report on ZDNet, a tech insider newsletter.</p><p>How much ChatGPT’s degree of innovation matters is up for debate. If analysts can use ChatGPT to read 200-page documents in a matter of minutes and prepare a report, that can save companies time and money. “But when you see people talking about using these models to make investment decisions, there’s little evidence that I’ve seen that these models can do that,” says Angelo Calvello, founder of Rosetta Analytics, a small quant investment firm. (He is also an opinion columnist for <i>Institutional Investor</i>.) That said, big asset managers might be able to cut their staff 70 percent over time, Calvello argues, because generative AI “could write the IR letters, it could analyze documents. It’s all about efficiency.”</p><p>Of course, that is a major reason people are investing in AI’s perceived beneficiaries. Hedge fund manager Dan Loeb is one professional who claims to be ahead of the curve in investing in AI.</p><p>“We have watched AI evolve and believe the technology has matured to the point that it is driving a transformational technology platform shift similar to those seen roughly once per decade: the personal computer in the 1980s, internet in the 1990s, mobile in the 2000s, and cloud in the 2010s,” he wrote in a recent letter to his Third Point hedge fund’s investors. “AI is creating interesting investment opportunities in the information technology ‘stack,’ and we have increased our exposure to companies throughout the software and semiconductor value chains that should benefit from mass adoption of large language models, one of the foundational technologies underlying generative AI.”</p><p>The Third Point CEO says his hedge fund has been investing in “AI-enabled business models” since 2016. At that time, it made a Series B venture investment in Upstart, a fintech player that claims to use AI in making loans.</p><p>Upstart “ultimately became the firm’s most lucrative investment,” Loeb writes in his letter to investors. To be sure, Third Point did make a fortune in Upstart; its 16 percent stake in the company was worth as much as $3.9 billion in the third quarter of 2021 — the peak of the recent tech bubble — as the hedge fund began to unload its shares. (When Third Point invested in Upstart in 2016, the entire company was valued at a mere $200 million, notes PitchBook.) By the end of March 2022, Third Point was completely out and the stock was tanking. Upstart is now worth less than 10 percent of its value at the peak.</p><p>Short-sellers scoff at the designation of Upstart as an AI stock and have shorted 33 percent of its outstanding shares. This year, though, that trade has been another loser for the shorts, as Upstart rallied off its bottom during the generative AI boom. But though shares fell by about 50 percent in August after Upstart reported a big quarterly loss, shorts were still out $639 million, or nearly 100 percent, betting against Upstart this year as of August 25, according to S3 Partners.</p><p>One of the few AI shorts that has been profitable this year is SoundHound AI. Culper Research’s Christian Lamarco calls the company “a flailing AI wannabe claiming to have revolutionary technology, a growing restaurant business, and a massive backlog of contracts.” The 17-year-old company was brought public via a SPAC in 2022. It is not profitable, and insiders are dumping the stock, according to Culper’s July report. In it, Lamarco writes that SoundHound now “claims its AI technology will revolutionize phone and drive-thru ordering, but we think this foray is an utter failure.”</p><p>Culper asserts that SoundHound’s AI simply doesn’t work — it relies on call centers staffed by humans, say former employees that his firm interviewed. Short-sellers had made $8.25 million, an 18 percent gain, by August 25 by taking on SoundHound this year, says S3 Partners.</p><p>In response to Culper’s report, a company spokesperson said that “SoundHound’s voice AI platform powers millions of devices (cars, TVs, [internet of things] devices) and responds to billions of queries without human involvement, including via our customer service voice solutions. With its restaurant business, SoundHound is one of the only companies where humans are neither monitoring nor interfering in the ordering process. This includes our recently announced partnership with White Castle, where our AI-only drive-thru solution is scaling to 100 locations next year.”</p><p>By far the biggest company in the AI space that short-sellers are targeting is C3.ai — which has been more resilient to their attacks. Two-short sellers, Sahm Adrangi’s Kerrisdale Capital and Ben Axler’s Spruce Point Capital, have taken aim at C3.ai, noting that it is another pivot to AI and — like the others — has never been profitable in several years of existence.</p><p>“The company was originally founded as C3 Energy to develop analytics solutions for public utilities preparing for the emergence of cap-and-trade and smart grids,” Adrangi wrote in a recent report on the company. “But management’s master stroke was rebranding operations as C3.ai in 2019 and going public with the ‘AI’ stock ticker, thus securing its place as the default artificial intelligence stock play for the undiscriminating investor despite the bulk of its business coming from relatively dated analytics models built for a very small number of utility, energy, and government customers.”</p><p>As Adrangi tells <i>II</i>, “I don’t think you can claim to be an AI business just by calling yourself AI.”</p><p>C3.ai, helmed by software entrepreneur and Silicon Valley luminary Tom Siebel, “does have a real business. It’s just not worth where it’s currently trading at,” Adrangi explains. “In the most recent 12 months, it basically nearly burned as much cash as it had revenue.”</p><p>Axler says investors are “clearly making a bet” on Siebel, who sold his previous company, Siebel Systems, to Oracle for $5.85 billion in 2005. For his part, Siebel has lashed out at the short-sellers. In a Bloomberg interview, he called them “scumbags who should be in jail.”</p><p>And in a response posted on its website, C3.ai calls the Kerrisdale report “a highly creative and transparent attempt by a self-acclaimed short-seller to short the stock, publish an inflammatory letter to move the stock price downward, then cover the short and pocket the profits.” It also says Kerrisdale erred on two specific accounting criticisms in the report — gross margin and unbilled receivables.</p><p>The stock recovered some of the losses it incurred after the latest Kerrisdale report following a better-than-expected earnings report. But that has not mollified the short-sellers.</p><p>“We’re probably in the early-innings stage of where we are in the AI cycle, and it still remains to be seen who are going to be the winners and losers,” says Axler, who first began shorting C3.ai in February 2022. “But ultimately, we don’t see C3.ai as being a big winner.”</p><p>It has been a tough slog for the short-sellers so far. As of August 25, C3.ai short sales were 34 percent of the float, and this year, short-sellers had lost almost $380 million, a 51 percent decline, betting against Siebel, according to S3 Partners. The stock is up more than 150 percent this year, although it’s down almost 40 percent from its peak in June.</p><p>Applied Digital is also down about 40 percent from its high point — which came in July, when the company announced the Character.ai deal and shortly after insiders had registered plans to sell their shares. Short-seller reports by David and Koppikar also dinged the stock. Then, on August 14, investors sued the company in a Dallas federal court, repeating short-sellers’ claims that Allied Digital had misled investors about its business model and the independence of its board members, based on close ties to B. Riley, its underwriter and Applied Digital CEO Cummins’ employer. (Applied Digital has denied the allegations.)</p><p>Despite the recent setbacks for some of these stocks, AI is still driving the markets higher. Notably, last week Nvidia reported record quarterly sales of $16 billion, far ahead of market expectations. How long the momentum can last is another question.</p><p>Cautions Adrangi: “With all these overvalued, overhyped stocks, it’s hard to call when the bubble will burst. But one day it does.”<br></p>

You might think that with the original cognomen locked into place for such families, members would get a second cognomen so that there would be at least one part of their name that could identify them.

Other languages need a different word for male and female people so their either end up collecting personal information that they wouldn't need for the service they are offering or they have to find some impersonal way to address you.<p>An example with Italian. Welcome is benvenuto for men and benvenuta for women. Welcome back is either bentornato or bentornata. It's impossible to use them unless we ask for the genre of the customer or use a DB / AI to infer it from the name. We still need a way to let the customer fix any mistake, a mistake which would probably be unwelcome.</p><p>So the common workaround is to use words like ciao, which is informal and possibly not well received by older people, or buongiorno which is OK for most of the day but not in the night (good morning vs good evening) or just use the name.</p><p>Best solution, if you don't need names to serve your service or because of regulations, don't ask them, use only the email address and make GDPR happier.

Some rare family names are two characters and usually they will have a single character given name. Some people have single character family name and single character given name.</p><p>Then you get people from different ethnic groups who put the family name at the end. Often these are characterised by a long given name and then an interpunct joining that with the family name, but that's not always done. For instance a popular singer at the moment has the Chinese name 希林娜依·高 where 高 is a fairly normal Chinese surname so it's easy to identify as such. A very popular actress is named 迪丽热巴·迪力木拉提 so it's not always the case you can easily tell which name is which.</p><p>Even for those with simple construction, so the characters are FAB (family name, and 2 characters for given name). You'll find that within a family, where you might expect pet names, it's common instead to call each other by AB, except when they're annoyed and use the full name FAB. In a business context, someone with a higher rank might be F先生 (Mr F), F总 (Manager F), F董 (Director F), but close colleagues might call you AA, BB, 小A, 小B etc - but typically they won't get to choose that, they'll be told by the person "you can call me ___" and they might allow different people to use different names or react with their official title if someone uses too informal a name with them.</p><p>I've got Chinese friends who exclusively use an English name at work in China. I've got a friend who later moved to the UK, and most people in the UK know her by her Chinese name, but except for a few close school friends, nobody in her working life in China even knew her real name because the company she worked for only used English names (this isn't very common though).</p><p>In other countries, many people don't use their first name much. In the UK, I've known quite a few people who've primarily used their middle name, and others (including me) are generally known by others with a name that isn't among any of their given names. Sometimes these are common transformations, e.g. David to Dave, David to Dai (in Wales), but other times people just use initials or nicknames (e.g. I've got a friend who pretty everybody calls Danger, it started as a joke with friends, but now even his parents sometimes use it!)</p><p>Anyway, that was a long diversion, but it's always safer I think to ask for the full name as one field that not try to change it, but use it exactly as provided for official purposes, and to also ask for a preferred name for your communication with them. In cases were you share the name to other people, e.g. an online community, you might want an additional display name which might well be different again.

I guess the answer depends on how you plan to handle the names once they got submitted.<p>I happen to be handing that data over to airlines, which has some of the less forgiving, yet fragmented name requirements. If you handle this incorrectly, your customer can't fly, even after they paid for the flight. And for those who say that this doesn't matter as much: <i>It absolutely does</i>. People do get confused by this more frequently than you think. I've seen people losing an entire trip that they saved for, all because of unclear naming requirements.</p><p>The way I deal with this is to provide a country and locale specific name fields. You don't have to detect the geolocation or track the user for this, just let them choose whatever locale setting they want, and give them the "sensible" layout. Here are some examples:</p><p>- In Vietnam, we use last name then first name.</p><p>- In Indonesia, we use first name, then last name, but also give an option to declare that the person doesn't have a last name.</p><p>- In Singapore, we use a single field to input the first name and last name.</p><p>Even when you've handled the layout convention carefully, the 3rd party you're handing the data to, if one exists, might not give the same care and attention that you do. In my case: some airlines just haven't gotten around the idea that some people simply don't have last names. When a person with a single name wants to fly, airlines want the customer to use the name for both first and last name (e.g. If the person's name is David, then the airline expects "David David"). If you require First Name and Last Name as the input, and don't elaborate on how to fill them, the customer might simply fill the last name with a dot (".") character. The airlines / any other 3rd party won't accept that.  For this, I suggest to detail out the ways in which you handle the data and go talk to your providers, if any.</p><p>All in all, it's a pretty tough challenge, and the wisdom around this isn't going to fit inside a single HN post. I do commend you for actually thinking about this problem. Good Luck.

I‘ve been Mr First Name, Mr Middle Name, Mr Last Name, and so on.

Sometimes I suspect it’s recorded incorrectly but also used incorrectly in a different way.</p><p>Normally it’s not a problem, but like you say, airline tickets can cause issues. I think I’ve been demoted from “check in online” to “check in at a counter because we need to check your paperwork” a bunch of times because my passport doesn’t match my name on my ticket. Often it’s not even the name order – the airline will only sell my ticket with a first name and last name field (meaning I have to drop my middle name, which is on my passport) or they ask for all three and then concatenate first and middle with no space and truncate the last few letters.</p><p>Everything would be so much easier if I could just <i>enter my name</i>.

The idea that there is a single category of "western name" is wonky.<p>Another is that my spoken/given name is after my "middle" name. Especially American forms don't deal well with that. In Sweden, you usually underline the given name, since it's used to address the person. Now I see a comment here saying that's a thing in the Philippines. That's interesting.

And of course everyone knows we should just use "name" and that's it. Perhaps a greeting/displayname if we need to do "Hello $customer" in an email.<p>But still. There are often hard requirements <i>that are impossible to reconcile</i>  with the "just store one name" idea.
As an example: you need to produce alphabetically sorted lists. It would rarely be acceptable to produce lists of people sorted by their given names in Western Europe for example. So as an example if you really do need to have BOTH "Doe, John" and "John Doe" what do you do in case you know at least 99% of users will have names following this format? Do you force people to enter their name twice? In that situation I would:</p><p>- Store it as a single name column, with more columns as required (greeting, sortable, ).</p><p>- Present a UX that is appropriate for the region of 99% users. So for western Europe show a "first name", "last name", but don't store that: just set the name column to "$firstname $lastname" and the index name column to "$lastname, $firstname" and greeting to "$firstname" for example. That way I at least let 99% of your users only input the name once.</p><p>- But (and this is important) offer an alternative way of specifying it for those who don't have a name that conforms to the format. You let just that small fraction of users enter a name/indexname/greeting instead.</p><p>And yes: the above ONLY applies if it's really a hard requirement to separate them, because the last name sorting was really a requirement. Of course there are other requirements that force other solutions. The "just one input" is the correct solution for all the cases where it is possible.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>So… I’ve had the most unreal week of coding. Zero exaggeration, I’ve halved the
RAM requirements of the search engine, removed the need to take the system
offline during an upgrade, removed hard limits on how many documents can be indexed,
and quadrupled soft limits on how many keywords can be in the corpus.</p><p>It’s been a long term goal to keep it possible to run and operate the system
on low-powered hardware, and so far improvements have been made, to the point
where my 32 Gb RAM developer machine feels spacey rather than cramped, but this
set of changes takes it several notches further.</p><p>But to roll back the tape to more somber times.</p><p>Marginalia Search went offline for almost a week due to some problems
with the <a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/release-notes/v2023-08-0/">latest release</a>.</p><p>I won’t go into the details too much here, it was a string of fairly trivial
scaling problems in a process with a run time of 1 day when it works well
and 2-3 days when it doesn’t. Had to restart it a few times, mostly because
it ran out of RAM.</p><p>The cause of the <em>outage</em> was the fact that the system needs to go offline
during an index switch in the first place. If it could have staid online while
all this went on, nobody would have been the wiser…</p><p>The reason for this is that the URL database is wiped during an upgrade.</p><p>Inserting and updating rows in a database table rapidly approaching a billion rows
is <em>slow</em>, and the processes involved in loading the new data uses a crap-ton of RAM
and can’t co-run with the index service which does the same; and the primary key for
the table is also a 32 bit integer so … you can’t really go beyond 2 billion in the
first place.</p><p>While the processes to get the system up and kicking again were ticking along,
I had a moment to reflect on the problems, came up a plan to slay the dragons
responsible for needing any sort of outage, while at the same time drastically
reducing the system requirements.</p><h2 id="the-first-dragon--the-url-database">The First Dragon: The URL database.</h2><p>The URL database is one of the oldest components of the search engine and a
lot of the design decisions that went into it made sense at the time, but that
hasn’t been the case for years since. Everything about the system is alien
to how it looked back when the tables were first drawn up.</p><p>Migrating the data has been such a nasty prospect that it’s mostly been left to
be as-is modulo some fairly small changes (ALTER TABLE … takes a few hours in prod).</p><p>At the heart of the URL database is two tables that are only ever written to while loading a new
index, and only ever read via primary key lookups. There’s an additional index keeping paths
unique within domains, and it is just absurdly large for what it does.</p><p><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/87_absurd_success/olddesign.png" alt="An excerpt of the tables involved"></p><p>There’s a URL table mostly responsible for assigning an unique numeric ID to each URL,
and a PAGE_DATA table, where each PAGE_DATA entry contains information such as the title and
of a link, if we’ve indexed it.</p><p>So what if we smack these two tables together into a single table <strong>sqlite database</strong>,
keep the data real simple, make the loader process responsible for generating unique IDs,
and have some other table for enumerating URLs we aren’t indexing… yeah that’s pretty doable.</p><p>It’s an unconventional choice to mix sqlite and mariadb like this, but the two serve different needs.
The system needs a persistent view of the world, but that view is relatively small, like sub 1 GB most likely,
but also plug-and-play state changes (with state in the terabytes). It does fly in the face of every
conventional wisdom, but has real benefits.</p><p>So, something like this:</p><p><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/87_absurd_success/newdesign.png" alt="The new tables"></p><p>We’re still softly relating the DOCUMENT and DOMAIN tables acoss databases, but we never actually need to join
the two; in fact in a disaster scenario, the most important bits of the DOMAIN table can be re-constructed from the DOCUMENT table.</p><p>I’m glossing over some details…</p><h2 id="generate-unique-url-ids-with-no-index">Generate unique URL IDs with no index</h2><p>The URLs table was using 32 bit IDs, and it was always on the brink of integer rollover
and a known scaling issue. Part of why the URL database is wiped is to keep the ID
column from overflowing.</p><p>This doesn’t really work if we want to generate unique IDs in a way that won’t require us
to keep a collection of each URL we’ve seen in memory. URLs are sometimes repeated so we
can’t just use a counter and increment each time.</p><p>Each record also had a DOMAIN ID, but each URL only has a single domain. In the old solution
there was a unique constraint on URL ID and DOMAIN ID. That’s not really desirable, as indices
get very expensive for tables this large.</p><p>So let’s <em>construct</em> a 64 bit ID instead of letting the database assign one for us. Say the lower
26 bits are an ordinal, bits 26-56 are a document ID, and the highest most bits are reserved for the
index to do sorting tricks with.</p><p>This permits about 67,000,000 documents per domain (~10x English Wikipedia), and 2 billion domains,
which is nearly 100 times as many domains as the number of domains Marginalia has seen referenced
anywhere on the web. Nice and future proof.</p><p>We’re moving a lot of data sanity responsibility out of the database and into the process that
generates the data, but they are a lot cheaper to enforce on that end so that’s a feature, if a
bit unconventional.</p><p><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/87_absurd_success/urlscheme.png" alt="bit coding scheme for the new ID"></p><h2 id="unexpected-benefits">Unexpected Benefits</h2><p>So getting rid of all these humongous indices and large tables mixing hot and cold URL data means
the MariaDB server doesn’t need 36 Gb of RAM anymore. The hot data left in MariaDB is a few hundred
megabyteas at most, and the server most likely won’t need more than 2 Gb assigned to it.</p><p>The SQLite data needs an index too, but only for its primary key, and the actual hot part of
the index should be sub-gigabyte. It’s this much smaller because we’re indexing an order of
magnitude less data, and the index is of a single 64 bit long. There is no additional unique
constraint!</p><p>Additionally, since the output from the loader is now just a bunch of files, it turned out to
be pretty easy to create an automatic backup of these files. That means that in the case of
a bad deployment, the system can recover from a disaster within a few hours as contrasted with almost
a week like before.</p><p>If I had stopped there, it would be a pretty sweet change, but I felt emboldened by the success
and decided to turn to the other piece of ancient technical debt.</p><h2 id="the-second-dragon--reverse-index-construction">The Second Dragon: Reverse index construction</h2><p>The previous changes mostly affected the loader. It outputs a urls database and a (document,words[])-oriented
journal of document data. We need to transpose that data into something that is not only on the shape (word,documents[]),
but then make it indexable.</p><p>To help do this, a lexicon is used to map from keyword strings to a dense mapping of term ids. The first word you insert
gets id 0, the next word id 1, etc. This is basically a long-&gt;int open hash map. The system maps from string to long using
a 64 bit hash function.</p><p>The problem with this is that it gets full. This is mostly a Java problem, since Java doesn’t permit arrays with more than 2
billion entries; and the implementation used chokes all the way back at 1 billion. You can work around it, but even if you do,
the next problem is that at 1 billion entries, it uses 12 Gb of RAM.</p><p>The index service sits at a well-endowed 60 Gb RAM in production right now, most of which is off-heap memory so it could do with
going on a bit of a diet. It’s on-heap (i.e. within-JVM) size somewhat exceeds 32 Gb wich is especially unfortunate, as it prevents
the use of <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.org/display/HotSpot/CompressedOops">CompressedOOPs</a>, which is something you really want in Java.</p><p>The old reverse index construction has, like the URLs table, been around for a hot minute. It’s mostly been around due to how
unpleasant it is to work with. I was really struggling to find a good abstraction while I originally built it, and it’s been
<em>append only code</em> since. It’s not made better by this inherently being very finicky programming. If anything is even the slightest
bit off, everything falls apart in deeply inscrutable ways.</p><p>Very loosely, the shape of the algorithm was something like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span>  highestWordId <span>=</span> findHighestWordId<span>();</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>long</span><span>[]</span> counts <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>long</span><span>[</span>highestWordId<span>];</span>

</span></span><span><span>    documents<span>[</span>offsets<span>[</span>word<span>]++]</span> <span>=</span> document
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This part writes about a terabyte of data out of order to a memory mapped file. Since it is almost completely
out of order, most of these changes are constantly being committed to disk. You may have heard
that SSDs deal with random access much better than mechanical hard drives. For read access this is largely
true, for small writes it is not, due to an effect called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_amplification">write amplification</a>.</p><p>In brief, every time an SSD updates a single byte anywhere on disk, it needs to erase and
re-write that entire page. To avoid this it has caches that gather adjacent writes into a single operation,
but these caches aren’t terabyte sized, and do nothing in this scenario.</p><p>So while we’re writing a terabyte, the hard drive is writing something like half a petabyte. This is understandably slow and puts an insane amount of wear on the disk.</p><p>For a long time a stopgap has been in placed called a <code>RandomWriteFunnel</code>, which buckets the writes
into smaller files first, and then writes the larger file in-order. This is very slow, but not
as slow as spraying and praying like the original algorithm did.</p><p>I’ve understood for a long time that this is not the civilized way of transposing index data. What you do instead is
to create a series of smaller indexes where everything fits in memory, and then you merge them. Merging sorted lists
is fast and even mechanical hard drives agree with the operation. Still a bit finicky though, especially since we’ll
merge sorted lists of sorted lists that need merging.</p><p>If you construct the index this way, you <strong>no longer need the lexicon</strong>! It’s possible to use the 64 bit string hashes
for term ids instead!</p><p>Initially a few head-scratchers cropped up:</p><ul><li><p>The input to the index construction is compressed. How can parts of it be read quickly? — Don’t. Create multiple smaller files instead, and read them one by one.</p></li><li><p>What is a good way to merge indexes? — Don’t. Merge the data before the indexes are created.</p></li></ul><p>An abstraction called a <code>preindex</code> is introduced, which is basically what was constructed in the
code sample above. Two arrays, one with wordIds, and one with counts; both indexing a third array
with document data.</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/MarginaliaSearch/MarginaliaSearch/blob/master/code/features-index/index-reverse/src/main/java/nu/marginalia/index/construction/ReversePreindex.java">index-reverse/…/ReversePreindex</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/MarginaliaSearch/MarginaliaSearch/blob/master/code/features-index/index-reverse/src/main/java/nu/marginalia/index/construction/ReversePreindexDocuments.java">index-reverse/…/ReversePreindexDocuments</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/MarginaliaSearch/MarginaliaSearch/blob/master/code/features-index/index-reverse/src/main/java/nu/marginalia/index/construction/ReversePreindexWordSegments.java">index-reverse/…/ReversePreindexWordSegments</a></li></ul><p><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/87_absurd_success/preindex.svg" alt="Preindex"></p><p>Since the inputs are small, these preindexes are easy to construct as we can do most of it in RAM. It’s so much easier when you can do you can assume the data fits in RAM. We can then commit them to disk as we generate them, and add a subsequent merging step to construct one final preindex.</p><p><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/87_absurd_success/merging.svg" alt="Successive merging of files"></p><p>The preindex is finally turned into the reverse index by adding static btree indices to the words
table and each document block like before. This is a relatively quick process.</p><p><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/87_absurd_success/index.svg" alt="The final output"></p><p>This does not only require much less RAM since the lexicon is out, it’s also quite a bit
faster than the original algorithm. But wait, there’s more! The lexicon had the unfortunate
side-effect of giving each set of processed data its own dialect, a word might be given one ID
in one run, but probably another ID in another run. This meant that you needed to process all data
at the same time. Foregoing the lexicon, it’s possible to merge disparate sets of data, and e.g.
reuse the output of processing a large set of seldom-changing data (say Wikipedia), and join it with
more frequently changing index data.</p><h2 id="in-closing">In closing</h2><p>This set of changes has been absurdly successful. The system RAM requirement has been halved,
almost every single known scaling problem and operational paper cut has been addressed. It’s also
had unexpected benefits I’ve only begun to consider.</p><p>I wish I knew what happened, or how to replicate it. It’s involved more upfront design than I
normally do, by necessity. I like feeling my way forward in general, but there are problems where
the approach just doesn’t work. This is squarely within that domain.</p><p>Sometimes you just tug at the right yarn I guess, and then problems unravel one by one.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>The federal government will not force adult websites to bring in age verification following concerns about privacy and the lack of maturity of the technology.</p><p>On Wednesday, the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, released the eSafety commissioner’s long-awaited <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/04/labor-to-consider-age-verification-roadmap-for-restricting-online-pornography-access" data-link-name="in body link">roadmap for age verification</a> for online pornographic material, which has been sitting with the government since March 2023.</p><p>The federal government has decided against forcing sites to bring in age verification technology, instead tasking the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, to work with the industry to develop a new code to educate parents on how to access filtering software and limit children’s access to such material or sites that are not appropriate.</p><figure id="eab0beff-bb27-476a-8c7f-8af05fd88457" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:3,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/20/australia-eyes-uk-online-bill-in-fight-with-tech-companies-over-encryption-child-safety&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Australia eyes UK online bill in fight with tech companies over encryption and child safety&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;eab0beff-bb27-476a-8c7f-8af05fd88457&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>“It is clear from the roadmap at present, each type of age verification or age assurance technology comes with its own privacy, security, effectiveness or implementation issues,” the government’s response to the roadmap said.</p><p>The technology must work effectively without circumvention, must be able to be applied to pornography hosted outside Australia, and not introduce the risk to personal information for adults who choose to access legal pornography, the government stated.</p><p>“The roadmap makes clear that a decision to mandate age assurance is not yet ready to be taken.”</p><ul>

</ul><p>The new tranche of codes will be developed by eSafety following the implementation of the first set of industry codes in December this year.</p><p>The government will also bring forward an independent statutory review of the Online Safety Act in 2024 to ensure it is fit for purpose and this review will be completed in this term of government. The UK’s approach to age assurance will also be monitored as the UK is “a key likeminded partner”.</p><p>In the roadmap, eSafety’s research found of the 75% of 16 to 18-year-olds who said they had seen online pornography, nearly one-third had seen it before the age of 13, and nearly half between 13 and 15.</p><p>The report suggested to trial a pilot of age assurance technologies, but this was not adopted by the government. The report also noted the government’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/07/government-considers-centralising-digital-id-verification-on-mygov-in-wake-of-optus-breach" data-link-name="in body link">development of a digital ID</a> in the wake of the Optus and Medibank data breaches, but said it was not suggesting the government ID be used for confirming ages on pornographic websites.</p><p>The roadmap said there was also a gap in sex education, particularly for LGBTQ+ people, with online pornography filling the place in many cases.</p><p>“In our research, [participants who identified as lesbian, gay or bisexual] were also significantly more likely to say there were some positive effects of online pornography on young people learning about sex and exploring sexuality than straight participants. Some stakeholders reflected this may be due to a lack of other representations or learning sources for young LGBTIQ+ people – including a lack of inclusive sex education in schools.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-14">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-14" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>The government said it had funded $83.5m over six years for age-appropriate, evidence-based respectful relationships education.</p><p>While Pornhub remained the most popular pornographic site for Australian users, the report also noted that Australian-based industry bodies reported the local creators tended to be female or LGBTQ+, operating as sole traders.</p><p>“Between these two ends of the spectrum are a variety of businesses with different business models and levels of size, maturity, capacity, and capability to adopt technological measures to promote children’s safety. What constitutes appropriate steps for one provider might create an undue burden for another.”</p><p>Rowland said the roadmap underscored the value of the industry codes and developing standards to keep children safe.</p><p>“The government supports this approach, and will work with the regulator to ensure the full and successful implementation of the Online Safety Act,” she said.</p><p>“While the government awaits the outcome of this process, the digital industry is on notice that we will not hesitate to take further action should it fail to keep children safe.”</p></div></div>]]></description>
