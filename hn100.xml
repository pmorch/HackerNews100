<article>
<p>Hi!  I'm <a href="https://was.tl/">Eric Wastl</a>. I make Advent of Code.  I hope you like it!  I also make <a href="https://was.tl/projects/">lots of other things</a>.  I'm on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/was.tl" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@ericwastl" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://github.com/topaz" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ericwastl" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p><em>Advent of Code</em> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar">Advent calendar</a> of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in <a href="https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code">any</a> programming language you like. People use them as <a href="https://twitter.com/dznqbit/status/1037607793144938497">interview prep</a>, company training, <a href="https://gitlab.com/imhoffman/fa19b4-mat3006/wikis/home">university</a> <a href="https://gribblelab.org/teaching/scicomp2021/index.html">coursework</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mrdanielklein/status/936267621468483584">practice</a> <a href="https://comp215.blogs.rice.edu/">problems</a>, a <a href="https://adventofcode.com/leaderboard">speed contest</a>, or to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/search?q=flair%3Aupping&amp;restrict_sr=on">challenge each other</a>.</p>
<p>You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7kd8jt/what_would_you_say_are_the_minimal_skills_for/dre0uu3/">problem solving skills</a> will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.</p>
<p>If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to  it with others or directly via <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/support">AoC++</a>.</p>
<h2>--- General Tips ---</h2>
<p>If you get stuck, try your solution against the <em>examples</em> given in the puzzle; you should get the same answers.  If not, re-read the description.  Did you misunderstand something?  Is your program doing something you don't expect?  After the examples work, if your answer still isn't correct, <em>build some test cases</em> for which you can verify the answer by hand and see if those work with your program.  Make sure you have the entire puzzle input.  If you're still stuck, maybe <em>ask a friend</em> for help, or come back to the puzzle later.  You can also ask for hints in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/" target="_blank">subreddit</a>.</p>
<h2>--- Frequently Asked Questions ---</h2>
<p id="faq_codeselect"><em>Is there an easy way to select entire code blocks?</em> You should be able to triple-click code blocks to select them. You'll need JavaScript enabled.</p><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl
use warnings;
use strict;

print "You can test it out by ";
print "triple-clicking this code.\n";
</code></pre>
<p id="faq_auth"><em>How does authentication work?</em> Advent of Code uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth" target="_blank">OAuth</a> to confirm your identity through other services.  When you log in, you only ever give your credentials to that service - never to Advent of Code.  Then, the service you use tells the Advent of Code servers that you're really you.  In general, this reveals no information about you beyond what is already public; here are examples from <a href="https://api.reddit.com/user/reddit/about" target="_blank">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://api.github.com/users/octocat" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Advent of Code will remember your unique ID, names, URL, and image from the service you use to authenticate.</p>
<p id="faq_compete"><em>Should I compete on the global leaderboard?</em> Maybe. Solving puzzles is hard enough on its own, but competing for a spot on the global leaderboard also requires <a href="https://blog.vero.site/post/advent-leaderboard">many</a> <a href="https://kevinyap.ca/2019/12/going-fast-in-advent-of-code/">additional</a> <a href="https://gist.github.com/mcpower/87427528b9ba5cac6f0c679370789661">skills</a> and a lot of practice. Depending on the puzzle, that day's leaderboard usually fills up anywhere between two minutes and an hour. If that sounds interesting, go for it! However, you should do Advent of Code in a way that is useful to you, and so it is completely fine to choose <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/e2wjhf/comment/f90ksek/">an approach that meets your goals</a> and ignore the leaderboard entirely.</p>
<p id="faq_difficulty"><em>Why was this puzzle so easy / hard?</em> The difficulty and subject matter varies throughout each event. Very generally, the puzzles get more difficult over time, but your specific skillset will make each puzzle significantly easier or harder for you than someone else. Making puzzles is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7idn6k/question_why_does_the_difficulty_vary_so_much/dqy08tk/">tricky</a>.</p>
<p id="faq_unlocktime"><em>Why do the puzzles unlock at midnight EST/UTC-5?</em> Because that's when I can consistently be available to make sure everything is working. I also have a family, a day job, and even need sleep occasionally. If you can't participate at midnight, that's not a problem; many people use <a href="https://adventofcode.com/leaderboard/private">private leaderboards</a> to compete with people in their area.</p>
<p id="faq_highcontrast"><em>I find the text on the site hard to read. Is there a high contrast mode?</em> There is a high contrast alternate stylesheet. Firefox supports these by default (View -&gt; Page Style -&gt; High Contrast).</p>
<p id="faq_puzzleideas"><em>I have a puzzle idea! Can I send it to you?</em> Please don't. Because of legal issues like copyright and attribution, I don't accept puzzle ideas, and I won't even read your email if it looks like one just in case I use parts of it by accident.</p>
<p id="faq_puzzlebugs"><em>Did I find a bug with a puzzle?</em> Once a puzzle has been out for even an hour, many people have already solved it; after that point, bugs are very unlikely. Start by asking on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/" target="_blank">subreddit</a>.</p>
<p id="faq_streaming"><em>Can I stream my solution?</em> Please try to avoid giving away the solution while people are competing. If a puzzle's global daily leaderboard isn't full yet and you're likely to get points, please wait to stream/post your solution until after that leaderboard is full. If you are unlikely to get points or the daily leaderboard is already full for the puzzle you're working on, streaming is fine.</p>
<p id="faq_ai_leaderboard"><em>Can I use AI to get on the global leaderboard?</em> Please don't use AI / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank">LLMs</a> (like GPT) to automatically solve a day's puzzles until that day's global leaderboards are full. By "automatically", I mean using AI to do most or all of the puzzle solving, like handing the puzzle text directly to an LLM. The leaderboards are for human competitors; if you want to compare the speed of your AI solver with others, please do so elsewhere. (If you want to use AI to <em>help</em> you solve puzzles, I can't really stop you, but I feel like it's harder to get better at programming if you ask an AI to do the programming for you.)</p>
<p id="faq_copying"><em>Can I copy/redistribute part of Advent of Code?</em> Please don't. Advent of Code is free to <em>use</em>, not free to copy. If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs. If you're making a website, please don't make it look like Advent of Code or name it something similar.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mainContent">





  
  <h3>The New OpenWrt One on sale now for $89  — Ultimate Gift for Right-To-Repair Enthusiasts</h3>


<p>November 29, 2024</p>


  
    <p>Today, we at SFC, along with our OpenWrt member project, announce the production release of the OpenWrt One.  This is the first wireless Internet router designed and built with your software freedom and right to repair in mind.  The OpenWrt One will never be locked down and is forever unbrickable.  This device services <strong>your</strong> needs as its owner and user.  Everyone deserves control of their computing.  The OpenWrt One takes a great first step toward bringing software rights to your home: you can control your own network with the software of your choice, and ensure your right to change, modify, and repair it as you like.</p>

<p>The OpenWrt One demonstrates what's possible when hardware designers and manufacturers prioritize your software right to repair; OpenWrt One exuberantly follows these requirements of the copyleft licenses of Linux and other GPL'd programs.  This device provides the fully copyleft-compliant source code release from the start.  Device owners have all the rights as intended on Day 1; device owners are encouraged to take full advantage of these rights to improve and repair the software on their OpenWrt One.</p>
  

  
    
      <p>Priced at <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007795779282.html">US$89 for a complete OpenWrt One with case</a> (or <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008143000598.html">US$68.42  for a caseless One's logic board</a>), it's ready for a wide variety of use cases.  Manufactured in collaboration with Banana Pi, the OpenWrt One uses the MediaTek MT7981B SoC, with MT7976C wifi, 1 GiB DDR4 RAM, 128 MiB SPI NAND + 4 MiB SPI NOR flash, two Ethernet ports (2.5 GbE and 1 GbE), a USB host port, M.2 2042 for NVMe SSD or similar devices, and mikroBUS expansion header.  The OpenWrt offers both PoE (Power over Ethernet) via the 2.5 GbE port , or direct power via the USB-C power port with 12V USB-PD.  A convenient USB serial interface is built into the other USB-C port: expert users won't miss any boot messages!  This hacker-friendly device is unbrickable, providing a switch to separately flash the NOR and NAND portions of the flash memory.</p>

<p>This new product has completed full FCC compliance tests; it's confirmed that OpenWrt met all of the FCC compliance requirements.  Industry “conventional wisdom” often argues that FCC requirements somehow conflict with the software right to repair.  SFC has long argued that's pure <acronym title="Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt">FUD</acronym>.  We at SFC and OpenWrt have now proved copyleft compliance, the software right to repair, and FCC requirements are all attainable  in one product!</p>

<p>You can order an OpenWrt One now!  Since today is the traditional day in the USA when folks buy gifts for love ones, we urge you to invest in a wireless router that can last!  We do expect that for orders placed today, sellers will deliver by December 22 in most countries.</p>

<p>Everyone can purchase <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007795779282.html">a complete OpenWrt One with case</a> or <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008143000598.html">just the board</a> via those links and other sale outlets, too.  Regardless of where you buy from, for every purchase of a new OpenWrt One, a US$10 donation will go to the OpenWrt earmarked fund at Software Freedom Conservancy.  Your purchase not only improves your software right to repair, but also helps OpenWrt and SFC continue to improve the important software and software freedom on which we all rely!</p>

<p dir="auto">Privastead is a privacy-preserving home security camera solution that uses end-to-end encryption.
It has three key benefits:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>End-to-end encryption using the OpenMLS implementation of the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol.</li>
<li>Software-only solution that works with existing IP cameras with minimal trust assumptions about the IP camera.</li>
<li>Rust implementation (camera hub, MLS code for the mobile app, and untrusted server).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Components</h2><a id="user-content-components" aria-label="Permalink: Components" href="#components"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Privastead camera solution has three components:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A camera hub, which runs on a local machine and directly interacts with IP camera(s).</li>
<li>A mobile app that allows one to receive event notifications (e.g., motion) as well as livestream the camera remotely.</li>
<li>An untrusted server that relays (encrypted) messages between the hub and the app. In addition, Privastead uses the Google Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for notifications. Similar to the server, FCM is untrusted.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Threat Model and Guarantees</h2><a id="user-content-threat-model-and-guarantees" aria-label="Permalink: Threat Model and Guarantees" href="#threat-model-and-guarantees"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The key advantage of the Privastead camera solution over existing home security camera solutions is that it provides strong privacy assurance using end-to-end encryption.
More specifically, it makes the following assumptions:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It assumes that the local machine running the hub and the smartphone running the mobile app are secure and not compromised.</li>
<li>It assumes that the server is fully untrusted and under the control of the adversary.</li>
<li>It makes minimal trust assumptions about the IP camera. That is, it assumes that the camera does not have a covert, undisclosed network interface card (e.g., cellular) to connect to the Internet on its own (therefore, it's best that this is explicitly checked and verified by user). Other than that, the IP camera is untrusted and hence Privastead does not directly connect the camera to the Internet; rather, the camera is connected to the hub directly.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">It then provides the following guarantees:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It guarantees that only the hub and the mobile app have access to unecrypted videos.</li>
<li>It guarantees that the server cannot decrypt the videos.</li>
<li>It provides forward secrecy and post-comproise security through MLS (see definitions below).</li>
<li>It does NOT currently hide the timing of events and livestreams from the adversary (who we assume is in control of the server and/or FCM channel).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Definitions: According to MLS: ``Forward secrecy means that messages sent at a certain point in time are secure in the face of later compromise of a group member. Post-compromise security means that messages are secure even if a group member was compromised at some point in the past.''
What do these mean in Privastead?
In Privastead, the camera hub and the mobile app are the only members in an MLS group used for transfer of videos.
They mean that if the key used to encrypt a video between the hub and the app is compromised, that key cannot be used to decrypt any of the videos sent before and after the compromised video.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Supported Cameras</h2><a id="user-content-supported-cameras" aria-label="Permalink: Supported Cameras" href="#supported-cameras"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Privastead camera can theoretically support any IP camera (or any other camera that has an open interface).
The current prototype relies on RTSP and ONVIF support by the camera.
The former is used for streaming videos from the camera and the latter is used for querying events.
So far, the following cameras have been tested:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Amcrest, model: IP4M-1041W (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amcrest-UltraHD-Security-4-Megapixel-IP4M-1041W/dp/B095XD17K5/" rel="nofollow">Link</a> on Amazon)

<p dir="auto">Ntfs2btrfs is a tool which does in-place conversion of Microsoft's NTFS
filesystem to the open-source filesystem Btrfs, much as <code>btrfs-convert</code>
does for ext2. The original image is saved as a reflink copy at
<code>image/ntfs.img</code>, and if you want to keep the conversion you can delete
this to free up space.</p>
<p dir="auto">Although I believe this tool to be stable, please note that I take no
responsibility if something goes awry!</p>
<p dir="auto">You're probably also interested in <a href="https://github.com/maharmstone/btrfs">WinBtrfs</a>,
which is a Btrfs filesystem driver for Windows.</p>
<p dir="auto">Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ebiggers">Eric Biggers</a>, who <a href="https://github.com/ebiggers/ntfs-3g-system-compression/">successfully reverse-engineered</a> Windows 10's
"WOF compressed data", and whose code I've used here.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">On Windows, from an Administrator command prompt:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>ntfs2btrfs.exe D:\</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Bear in mind that it won't work with your boot drive or a drive containing a
pagefile that's currently in use.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you are using WinBtrfs, you will need to clear the readonly flag on the
<code>image</code> subvolume before you can delete it.</p>
<p dir="auto">On Linux, as root:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>ntfs2btrfs /dev/sda1</code></p>

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Two things are true.</p>
<p>The first is going to sound bad in a culture where engineers are encouraged to apologize for existing while it is totally acceptable for a grifter that can't code to insist that they're a "thought leader". It is that, in my immediate professional environment, I am consistently acknowledged to be one of the best engineers around. As a rough rule, I study more than the average engineer around me by up to two orders of magnitude. I've been made an offer at the senior level at one of the best companies in the state, various Serious People happily re-employ me, and become incensed when I see lazy commit messages. I'm doin' pretty good.</p>
<p>The second, and this one is going to sound bad because I sometimes need to convince people to employ me, is that I am <em>clearly worse</em> than almost everyone that emails me along all of these dimensions. I only have a dim understanding of how my 3-4 years of experience coming from a strong background in <em>psychology</em> has rounded to "senior engineer", I've only ever written tests for personal projects because no employer I've ever seen actually had <em>any</em> working tests or interest in getting them, and I wrote the entirety of my Master's thesis code without version control because one of the best universities in the country doesn't teach it. In short, I've never solved a <em>truly</em> hard problem, I'm just out here clicking the "save half a million dollar" button that no one else noticed. I'm a fucking moron.</p>
<p>I know the second is true because I see how truly complex some of the things people do for a living are, and I know the first is true because I have been effortlessly <em>cruising</em> my way to the top 3-4% of the country's income bracket as an immigrant. <em>How are they both true?</em></p>
<h2 id="i">I.</h2>
<p>Throughout high school, I was a truly horrendous art student. It was my least favourite class, as I had recently moved to an international school, and the local Malaysian syllabus didn't waste time on things like "creativity", or "culture", or really anything other than maths and language. I'd turn up, I'd not really understand how the other students from Western backgrounds were translating mental images into drawings so effortlessly, and I'd score the lowest possible passing grade. Eventually I decided that I "wasn't artsy" and didn't draw anything other than doodled cubes for about ten years.</p>
<p>A great deal of life experience later, I decided that it simply couldn't be that hard, and it would be an amazing accomplishment to get through this barrier. In 2022, I tried a course called <a href="https://drawabox.com/">Drawabox</a>, which was incredibly boring and led to no progress. On a whim, I decided to look on <em>Hackernews</em>, a place that at the time I thought of as exclusively for technical articles, for a good drawing tutorial, whereas previously I had allowed myself to be guided onto the rocky shoals of Reddit. They are actually dumber on there, sorry Reddit.</p>
<p>This led me to Betty Edward's <a href="https://www.drawright.com/">Drawing On The Right Side Of The Brain</a>, a book whose title profoundly upsets me as someone that left psychology due to the field's horrendous epistemology. The book came with glowing recommendations, but it also came with <a href="https://www.drawright.com/before-after/marks-before-and-after-selfportrait-drawings">before and after</a> pictures that I assumed were too good to be true. The <em>after</em> picture felt so unattainable that saying you could get to that level felt like a weight loss scam. Still, I was determined, and my intuition said the testimonials were real despite all of that, so I gave it a go.</p>
<p>The first thing the book asks you to do is draw your hand as best as you can, so that you've got a frame of reference. I sat still for 30-45 minutes and poured my heart and soul into it. This is the result I got.</p>
<p><img alt="A malformed drawing of a left hand, with too-long fingers and a bulbous thumb." src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/73ba7ae7.jpeg"></p>
<p>This was <em>the best drawing I had ever made in my life</em> at the time, and it clearly leaves a lot to be desired. The book continues by providing some theory and exercises. The first exercise after this was to trace the lines in a drawing by eye, and if I recall, you are asked to trace it upside-down.</p>
<p><img alt="Upside_Down_Man.jpeg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/97b580f4.jpeg"></p>
<p>This was actually more-or-less exactly what the drawing was. At this point, I have done exactly two drawings, with no unshown practice of what I assumed was the vital mechanical skill of drawing, but decide to trace two more (from the internet this time) while dogsitting at a friend's house. You will note that these are both strongly nerdy fantasy-themed, because at the end of the day, I am very much a stereotypical programmer.</p>
<p><img alt="Knight_Drawing.jpeg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/ae262928.jpeg"></p>
<p><img alt="Dragon_Drawing.jpeg" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/83f658e8.jpeg"></p>
<p>Now <em>these</em> are the best drawings of my life, <em>again</em> with no unseen practice. They're a bit unclean and I made the initial components <em>way too big</em> so they both don't fit on the page. But at this point, as simple as these look, I am flabbergasted at the results I've gotten. I've lost 100 KGs with this One Simple Trick, doctors hate me (but this is because I didn't go into medicine like my parents wanted).</p>
<p>I have no idea if this newfound skill carries over when I'm not tracing lines, and instead drawing from life. I read a chapter or two more, and finally, with great trepidation, I take a stab at drawing my hand again. And is thus that, in about six hours of reading and practice spread over months, I moved from this:</p>
<p><img alt="A malformed drawing of a left hand, with too-long fingers and a bulbous thumb." src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/73ba7ae7.jpeg"></p>
<p>To this:</p>
<p><img alt="A pretty good hand drawn from a foreshortened perspective!" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/d02dbded.jpeg"></p>
<p><img alt="A hand making a finger gun!" src="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/images/b4dada97.jpeg"></p>
<p>I was prepared to go <em>my entire life</em> missing out on the joys of art until I picked up the right book. I am still typically the worst artist when I enter a room full of artists, but people <em>outside those rooms</em> (who didn't read one book) occasionally think I'm pretty okay, which is something I never expected to experience.</p>
<h2 id="ii-the-one-book-barrier">II. The One Book Barrier</h2>
<p>With this in mind, there seem to be two major clumps of engineers.</p>
<p>There are the engineers who have read 1+ books on a given topic, and sometimes on <em>several</em> topics, and they all come off as extremely competent. These are, for the most part, the people that make up the audience of this blog. Of course, you do not <em>literally</em> need to read a book - a sufficiently high volume of technical blogs or courses are probably the equivalent at varying levels of efficiency - but take it for granted there is some Large Sum of information that someone has studied.</p>
<p>Then there are engineers (and people in every profession) who <em>never try for the entirety of their careers</em>, and this is the majority of every profession. I spoke to a reader who is employed as an extremely high-level engineer, Seth Newman - by the way, I'll connect you if you want to hire a genius data engineer in the U.S - who described the average professional as sleepwalking through their working lives, and this rung true. Of course, they are not <em>literally</em> asleep so something else is going wrong, but the description still seemed apt. There is movement - enough movement to fall down a flight of stairs - but none of the awareness needed to avoid such an outcome.</p>
<p>Then there are people like myself, where I have read <em>exactly</em> one good book on most topics relevant to my profession, but have never gone particularly deep. I have a firm grasp of the Git data model through Pro Git, for example, but know nothing about the algorithms underlying it - which is still enough to dominate a truly randomly selected engineer. I've read enough of the arcane tomes that I can cast a cantrip and it looks like magic to the sleepwalking, but I look at a project like <a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia">Evennia</a> and realize that some people are out there casting Quickened Silent Still Maximized Disintegrate, which is <em>extremely impressive</em> for the non-D&amp;D nerds out there. I have spoken to high-performers in all sorts if fields at this point, and <em>every single one</em> has said that their profession is plagued by people that are essentially not even trying. I'm not sure how this is possible in things like medicine - have you seen how hard they have to work to pass those exams? - but it is nonetheless true.</p>
<h2 id="iii-our-endless-numbered-levels">III. Our Endless, Numbered Levels</h2>
<p>In the same conversation with Seth, I asked about what allowed him to work on the type of problem he was involved in, while I'm out here just trying to convince people to stop applying "flexible" schemas to every problem as if MongoDB has taken their kids hostage. This led to the topic of how deep specializations can go, and just how goddamn good people can get. I know very little about basketball, but Seth linked me to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i93vF0WOX6w">this video</a> where one of the worst players in the NBA, ten years post-retirement and out-of-shape, assassinates both amateur and professional athletes from lesser tiers. And he's <em>one of the worst players</em>, or so I've been told by people that actually know basketball.</p>
<p>But I can give a good example from my own experience too.</p>
<p>Here in Melbourne, I was considered a decent sabre fencer. I cleaned up most other amateurs, but there were always a couple of people around that would just wipe me out then go compete for the State championship. In particular, I've mentioned in <a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/fury-driven-development/">earlier writing</a> that I trained with a guy that eventually won Nationals here.</p>
<p>That guy once fenced someone trying to qualify for the Olympics, and was unable to score a <em>single</em> point on him. So we know that someone <em>struggling</em> to qualify for the Olympics is way better than the best fencer I know, and arguably the best in the country.</p>
<p>Malaysia entered one fencer into the 2012 Olympics, Yu Peng Kean, who was eliminated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing_at_the_2012_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_sabre"><em>15 to 1</em></a> by the guy that actually won that year. There are fencers that seriously train that can barely score a point on me. I can barely score against the top guy in Australia. That guy can barely score against someone trying to make the Olympics, and <em>that</em> guy can probably barely score against the guy that actually won the whole thing.</p>
<p>This is actually hardly a surprising result. One only needs to look at Magnus Carlsen's absolute domination of chess players that have trained their whole life, but it <em>feels</em> different when you're actually going up against it yourself. Competing against the top fencer in Australia feels <em>oppressive</em>. He is always effortlessly slightly out of reach, slightly faster, slightly more precise, and you're left feeling like a toddler trying to tackle an adult. And because I <em>do</em> have that level of edge over some people, untrained as they are, I know that's <em>exactly</em> what it's like from his perspective.</p>
<p>And there are two steps <em>at least</em> that large <em>after</em> you get to the National champion level? <em>Jesus Christ</em>.</p>
<h2 id="iv-incentives">IV. Incentives</h2>
<p>This is an aside, but there are many areas where I sleepwalk. I have mentioned many times that I am <em>not</em> making good progress on my piano lessons, and while it is true that I feel like I lack some natural talent in the area, it is also true that I simply don't practice enough.</p>
<p>However, I don't play the piano professionally and no one would pay me to do so. I can't help but feel that something has gone dreadfully wrong in society in that we've decided to start incentivizing people with no talent or interest to participate in the technology space. Many of them are extremely wide awake in other areas, be it sports, art, mathematics, whatever. Unfortunately for complex reasons related to some sectors having more money than they know what to do with, large organizations being impossibly hard to run well, and talking magazines covers trying to launder company funds into personal status, we're willing to pay people to be extremely bad programmers and extremely bad leaders. In fact, calling yourself a PowerBI developer is probably the single easiest way in the world to slack off 6+ hours a day in air-conditioned rooms at <em>well</em> above an average wage.</p>
<p>But since they're producing nothing <em>anyway</em>, or are a net negative to society accounting for opportunity cost, I can't help but feel that they'd somehow be so much more fulfilled if they got the sack somehow and we provided them all that money to just like, take care of their children and stop fucking around with databases they keep damaging. Of course, that likely isn't actually feasible (especially at executive compensation) but I can't stop thinking of this quote from the late Christopher Hitchens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/NegtQIkhz6g?si=O_5rhL0_cG9VvuD0&amp;t=24">My worst job was my first job.</a> It was very important to me, because in those days you had to be a member of the union to get a job in Fleet Street, in London journalism. And I couldn't get into the union so I couldn't get a job. And if you couldn't get a job then you couldn't get a union card. But finally there was a new job created - for a new magazine - I can still pronounce its horrible name, "The London Times Higher Education Supplement". And because it was a new job I didn't need to join the union, it was a new creation, so I got job and union card, and I was so proud, and so happy. I was the social science editor... and I cannot tell you how boring it was and how bad I was at it. And how I would literally watch the clock as the long day crept by. But it was a job, and it brought me to London, and it made me a member of the National Union of Journalists. And it was everything I wanted and it made me miserable. Finally, I was so bad at it that it could no longer be concealed from the editor. I got the sack, very traditionally in Britain, I got the sack on Christmas Eve. I was very depressed, I thought "how will I ever recover", "I'll never get another job", "maybe I can't even keep my union card". But I still sometimes think about it, and think "If I had been any good at that job, I might still be doing it."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="v">V.</h2>
<p>Something about having your skin in the game is that your relationship with sleepwalkers changes. That is, instead of resenting them, you're <em>glad that they're so bad</em> because they give you people to beat without having to dedicate your entire life to perfect performance.</p>
<p>There's some great reading on a similar concept in video games by Dan Luu, on how it takes <a href="https://danluu.com/p95-skill/">very little effort</a> to be a high performer. To be a high performer either means that you can do some fairly unambiguous task (like a backflip) <em>or</em> it can mean that you're performing well relative to other people.</p>
<p>Reading one book <em>typically</em> gets you to the point where you can do things like "add new functionality to this React app without incurring technical debt". This is good enough to make an ethical living, so long as you intelligently chose to do a thing that society pays for - sorry if you didn't, I'd build society differently if I was writing the rules. Reading multiple books is how you get good enough to compete for the absolute highest-paid jobs out there, where the fact you can do the above in a day instead of a week matters, and in the latter case you're simply going to have to read N+1 books, where N is whatever your competition is reading. It's an arms race.</p>
<p>But because Deloitte and the average developer don't read <em>any</em> books, they're just easy pickings. When you're trading off all your skin-in-the-game and working a permanent job, your interactions with these people leave you feeling helpless. You have to work with whoever the boss tells you too, and if they suck then you just have to deal with that.</p>
<p>If you're a bit more mercenary, then you get to turn up to interviews/meetings and dunk on them all day, and still have time to work out and be lazy. The last time I interviewed at a serious company, I was informed that I obliterated the competition so thoroughly that I "turned the planet into glass from orbit", and <em>I was still a weaker engineer than any of the seniors already at that company</em>. There are some jobs where I can't compete with the empty-suited masses, like perhaps government contracts, but that's because those industries aren't in the business of buying what I'm selling. I'm selling results and trust. Big enterprise is buying plausible lies that get executives promoted. I'll beat big consultants <em>every</em> time with the kind of person I actually want to work with.</p>
<p>Heck, you could probably eliminate almost all dud candidates during technical interviews by asking what their favourite tech book is, then only talking to candidates where you know enough to check if they've read that book. You'd have a false negative on anyone that read a great book you didn't know about, but I'm guessing almost no false positives.</p>
<h2 id="vi">VI.</h2>
<p>But now we get to a complicated case - what about the people that try very hard but nonetheless get no results? I know several people that run teams incompetently but are <em>genuinely trying</em>. However, no amount of training seems to get them there. They harass engineers, they panic, they don't know how to hire, they usually overestimate their own skill, but they're <em>trying</em>. They just <em>keep</em> trying to get Scrum right. They're sleepwalking straight into a lake, and all we can see are the flailing arms of a drowning person.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of things that cause this outcome, but I wanted to highlight a meta-skill that many of us have but can't quite articulate, and I suspect it's what they're missing. That is, how do you know what books to read?</p>
<p>For example, I started with <em>Drawabox</em> which was plausible on its face, but found that Betty Edward's book was substantially better for my goals. In fact, not only was it better, Drawabox simply assumed that I knew the One Weird Trick that Edwards highlighted, and moved straight on to mechanical skill - it is entirely possible I could have gotten through the whole course and had no appreciable progress with that missing puzzle piece. There were actually quite a few resources available, but I had some inkling I was on the wrong track. How do we have people that are basically doing the same thing with Scrum and not thinking "Wait, this is <em>not</em> working, what am I doing wrong? Is this even remotely the right course?"</p>
<p>I don't think I can explain <em>exactly</em> how I do it, or if there's a precise algorithm. It certainly seems like you need a little bit of bullshit detection, so in the tech space I'll typically only read something from a person who has built something impressive themselves. Big points for maintaining something open source or otherwise having some indicator of knowledge that is impossible to fake. If they've built something more nebulous, like "a big company", they score far fewer points because you can luck out or bullshit your way there. You can't lie your way into code compiling.</p>
<p>There are some other weird rules too, none of them hard and fast. Catchy names tend to result in getting dinged for a bit. The best books seem to have either boring or sophisticated covers. Anything with the word "leadership" in it is probably nonsense. The more the author brags about their awards, the more I think they're lying. A colloquial tone (like mine, sadly) tends to lose a few points, though it isn't a knockdown if the topics are nuanced. Thinking about this now, these are all things that seem extremely convincing to the drowning sleepwalkers.</p>
<p>Management at my day job brought us an Agile consultant the other day, who they loved, but they asked the engineers "How highly we'd rate our Agile training on a scale of 1 - 5" when that questions doesn't even mean anything. Some people <em>loved it</em>, and there's almost a 100% correlation with their love of that session and their reading of the wrong books.</p>
<p>Even <em>within</em> a book, you have to be able to discard large segments that don't have merit. The Phoenix Project is a good example: Gene Kim has written a whole book about organizational transformation, but he only put <em>one</em> bad actor into the whole book then made everyone else super competent and earnest. That's <em>not what big companies are like</em>, so you need to have enough of your brain switched on to get the good ideas then realize the rest of it is cringe-worthy leadership fanfic.</p>
<p>Not having whatever that ability is seems to cripple many people's ability to learn and better themselves. This is why it's so concerning when you hear some executives disclose their reading material - it is typically <em>immediately obvious</em> that there is almost no way they are actually good at their job. It is similarly why my eyes roll back into my skull when a leader tells me they do their learning on LinkedIn - like, what the fuck are you sickos on about? Have vendors been causing you brain damage to make sales easier?</p>
<h2 id="vii">VII.</h2>
<p>I was going to say that this was a post about how we should all take a moment to reflect on the unreasonable effectiveness of cracking open a book in the age of YouTube, but I guess what I actually want to say is <em>do not under any circumstances encourage people to read books</em>, it's easy money for the rest of us. My next blog post is going to be filled with anti-Git propaganda and links to Scrum resources. Godspeed, you glorious bastards.</p>

I lingered over the organic Honeycrisps, pausing to look at the $3.99-per-pound price tag, before filling my produce bag with several conventional Galas, which sold for a more reasonable $1.69 per pound. Though I had my heart set on the Honeycrisps, I’d recently had one too many bland, mealy ones with none of the fruit’s signature snap and sweet, tangy flavor, and I was unsure if I was ready to take that risk again, especially given the price.&nbsp;
</p>

<div id="mntl-sc-block_3-0"><p> It would have been an easier decision if Honeycrisps were as good today as they used to be. I first tasted one 10 years ago, standing at my mother-in-law’s kitchen counter in St. Louis on a cool September day. I grasped the rosy fruit she handed me and took a bite. The apple’s paper-thin skin produced an audible crunch, and a burst of sweet, tart juice immediately filled my mouth. I chewed carefully. I couldn’t recall the last time I ate an apple for pleasure, on its own—not in my hand as a grab-and-go breakfast as I rushed out of the house, not sliced up and slathered with <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/creamy-peanut-butter-taste-test-8627519" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">nut butter</a>, and not peeled, cored, chopped, and baked into a <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/pennsylvania-dutch-apple-pie-recipe-8399305" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">pie</a>. The Honeycrisp apple was revelatory for me: It was an apple that I truly enjoyed eating on its own.&nbsp;</p><p>And I did, for several years, until I noticed that the Honeycrisp apples I bought were, with increasing frequency, a miss. There were a few good ones here and there, but I often came across Honeycrisp apples that were dry and mealy. Beyond the hefty price tag, there was little to distinguish them from other standard apple varieties. <span></span>Honeycrisps from my farmers market were typically better than those I purchased from the grocery store, but even those Hudson Valley–grown apples weren’t immune. As recently as September of this year, I had several Honeycrisp apples from a local farm that were terribly mushy and flavorless, making me wonder if they had mistakenly labeled another apple variety—nothing about those apples was like the fruit I had once loved.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m not the only one who has noticed the fluctuation in quality. My colleagues <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/daniel-gritzer-5118638" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3">Daniel</a> and <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/megan-o-steintrager-7371874" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4">Megan</a> have both had their fair share of inferior Honeycrisps in the past couple of years. I also found multiple instances of people complaining about Honeycrisp quality on Reddit: Three years ago, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/t16tq8/why_do_honeycrisp_apples_suck_now/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="5">a user wrote</a> that the Honeycrisp apples they bought were “unrecognizable from the big sweet apples from the late 00s and 10s.” Another user, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/19bcwve/what_the_hell_happened_to_honeycrisp_apples/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="6">who posted earlier this year</a>, mourned the loss of the “super sweet and crisp” apples they were able to find 10 years ago. The Honeycrisps of today, they wrote, are “bitter and barely sweet at all" and "On top of that they aren’t crisp either!”</p><p>What went wrong? <span></span>The answer is both simpler and more complex than you might think, and it’s impossible to answer that question without looking at how the Honeycrisp apple came about—and how it shot to stardom so quickly.

<h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0"> <span> The Honeycrisp: Origins and Rise to Stardom </span> </h2>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0"> In 1983, David Bedford, one of the seed breeders behind the Honeycrisp apple and a research scientist at the University of Minnesota, had his first taste of the fruit. Crisp and juicy with a pleasant tanginess, the apple was unlike any he’d had before. “It caused me some question,” he tells me, recalling the sensory shock he experienced. “I remember biting it and thinking, well, what’s going on here?”&nbsp;He describes picking up textural and flavor notes similar to Asian pears and watermelons, and trying to decide if the fruit was underripe or overripe. "I don't know if it was a moment or a day or a week that it took me to decide, I don't know what it is, but it's good." The tree, labeled MN1711, bore fruit that was a cross between the Keepsake apple and another experimental variety identified only as MN1627; the tree had failed a winter hardiness test, and the university’s apple breeding program had designated it for the compost heap. Bedford, however, decided to give the tree another chance. It paid off, because it yielded what has since become <a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/about-minnesota/state-symbols/state-fruit-honeycrisp-apple/#:~:text=The%20Honeycrisp%E2%84%A2%20apple%20%28Malus,tree%20with%20high%20quality%20fruit." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1">Minnesota’s state fruit</a> and one of the most popular apple varieties today.
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0"> Together with Dr. Jim Luby, the former director of the University of Minnesota’s fruit breeding program, Bedford worked on improving the hardiness, texture, and flavor of the apple—placing it in the university’s evaluation program and observing it under different conditions—until they thought it was good enough to release to the public in 1991. “We had convinced ourselves on the breeding team that this is good, but we had no idea really what the rest of the world was thinking,” Bedford says. “It became clear in time that the world—the consumers—really did like this texture.”&nbsp;
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0"> For much of the 1960s and 1970s, Bedford tells me, there seemed to be no interest beyond the Red Delicious, the one “nice big shiny red apple that you could have year-round.” The Red Delicious was the result of the industrialization of the food system: National grocery stores and distributors wanted durable, aesthetically pleasing fruit that could be transported and stored easily, taste be damned. The skin was thick and leathery like naugahyde, with sweet, insipid flesh.
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0"> When Grady Auvil, the founder of Washington-based fruit company Auvil Fruit, began importing Granny Smith apples from New Zealand to the United States in the 1970s, it was a refreshing break from the Red Delicious for American consumers. The Granny Smith paved the way for the Honeycrisp: Americans welcomed the green apple’s tart flavor and crunch, signaling to growers and retailers that consumers were ready for different kinds of apples. When Bedford and Luby introduced Honeycrisp seedlings to nurseries and farmers in 1991, “there was at least some open-mindedness,” says Bedford. “Consumers had been sort of awakened to this idea that there was more to apples than Red Delicious.”&nbsp;
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0"> The Honeycrisp apple redefined what an apple could be. It was different from any other apple most American shoppers had encountered before, especially for consumers who frequented conventional grocery stores rather than farmers markets, where tastier heirloom varieties could be found even during the heyday of the Red Delicious. Unlike many other apple varieties, the Honeycrisp apple, journalists Deena Shanker and Lydia Mulvany noted in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-08/the-curse-of-the-honeycrisp-apple" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1">Bloomberg</a> in 2008, “wasn’t bred to grow, store, or ship well," Instead, "It was bred for taste: crisp, with balanced sweetness and acidity.” Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/apples-have-never-tasted-so-delicious-heres-why/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2">Bedford told <em>Scientific American</em></a> that you could separate the world of commercial apples into two phases: before Honeycrisp and after Honeycrisp. Before the variety’s debut, common grocery store apples were either soft and mealy or firm and dense. The Honeycrisp introduced the concept of a crisp apple to the public and, Bedford says, set a new bar for both customers and breeders—so much so that Bedford estimates, unofficially, that 50% of the new apple varieties coming onto the market today are Honeycrisp offspring.&nbsp;
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0"> This success is due to the fact that the Honeycrisp is—no exaggeration—built differently. It has a remarkably thin skin, and a crispness that is the result of the Honeycrisp having much larger cells than other apples. Apple cells contain vacuoles filled with juice; the cells are stacked on top of one another and held together by the lamella, or what Bedford describes as the “glue” that gives an apple its firm, crunchy texture. When you bite into an apple, your teeth cut through razor-thin skin and the layers of cells, fracturing the vacuoles of juice. It's these oversized cells that give the Honeycrisp its unique flavor and texture, making for a truly delicious apple with a crisp texture that people have come to crave.&nbsp;
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0"> Because the Honeycrisp was designed to thrive in Minnesota’s climate, Bedford and Luby made the apple available in the rest of the Midwest first, where growing conditions were fairly similar to those in the apple’s home state. Though nurseries began selling Honeycrisp cuttings in 1991, it took several years for the fruit to arrive at farmers markets and grocery stores in the Midwest. And when it did, it quickly became a word-of-mouth phenomenon.&nbsp;
</p>

<div id="mntl-sc-block_21-0"><p> People could not get enough. And unlike common apple varieties like the Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, or Granny Smith, the Honeycrisp wasn’t available to purchase year-round. Instead, it was only sold from September, when the apple was at its peak, to February. This scarcity drove up demand even more.</p><p>“People would go to their local apple orchard or to their supermarket because they had heard about [the Honeycrisp apple] in Minnesota or they tasted something,” Dr. Matthew Clark, the head of the University of Minnesota’s fruit breeding program, tells me. “Word got out, people were wanting it,” as the eating experience was “unlike any other.” Soon, growers were planting the Honeycrisp in New York and Washington.&nbsp;
</p></div>

</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0"> <span> Signs of Trouble </span> </h2>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0"> The tree, however, proved difficult to grow, especially in Washington State, the heart of commercial apple production in the United States. (According to the US Apple Association, Washington is projected to produce 179 million bushels—about 63% of all the apples grown in the United States—in the 2024/2025 calendar year, making it the country’s top apple growing state.) “Really a variety cannot be successful unless it’s grown commercially in Washington,” Bedford says. “We sent trees out, they tested it, and I had more than one grower call me and say, ‘That’s the worst tree I’ve ever tried to grow here. I’m pulling all the trees out.’” Not only is the fruit a poor fit for the state’s climate, which is much warmer than Minnesota, but it’s also prone to several physiological and storage disorders, like bitter pit and soft scald, which can affect both the presentation and eating quality of the fruit when it’s stored for an extended period of time.&nbsp;
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0"> In order to ensure the health of the tree, it’s essential to thin or selectively remove parts of it, a labor-intensive process. “Even if you’ve done all that hand-thinning and invested a lot in the crop, you can lose a lot of it to [bitter pit],” Josh Morgenthau, the owner of Fishkill Farms in Fishkill, New York, says. “It’s very fickle.” Unfortunately, even when farmers apply all of the best practices for ensuring the quality of their Honeycrisp crop, bitter pit can continue to show up in storage, and Morgenthau estimates that about 20% of fruit that looks clean when picked is no longer sellable because bitter pit shows up after a few months.

<p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0"> The fruit’s extraordinarily thin skin may be pleasant for biting through, but it also means the apple is prone to sunburn, in which the parts of the apple that get more sun exposure experience what scientists call “<a href="https://fruit.wisc.edu/2024/08/01/understanding-sunburn-in-apples-causes-symptoms-and-management/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1">tissue collapse</a>,” causing the fruit to turn brown or black. The delicate skin also makes it time-consuming to harvest: To prevent the apple’s sharp stems from puncturing neighboring apples in storage, the stems must be clipped extra-short. “Now, if you only had to do a couple hundred of those a day, no big deal,” Bedford muses. “But when you’re picking hundreds of thousands of these things, that slows down the picking process, which increases your costs.” (Dr. Kate Evans, the breeder at Washington State University who came up with the Cosmic Crisp apple, tells me that “something like 10 billion apples a year get picked by hand in the state of Washington.”)
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0"> Despite the challenges, growers in Washington—enticed by the profits the Honeycrisp could potentially bring and ignoring their initial bad experiences with it—eventually ended up planting acres and acres of Honeycrisp trees. As of 2017, the apple variety made up 13% of Washington’s apple acreage, making it the state’s <a href="https://wpcdn.web.wsu.edu/cahnrs/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/TB70E.pdf" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1">fourth-largest cultivar</a> after Red Delicious, Gala, and Fuji. “Farmers don’t miss out on an opportunity for something new and exciting,” Clark says. “Growing apples has tight margins and Honeycrisp and other premium apples give growers an opportunity to make some money and increase those margins.” Given the perceived quality and popularity of Honeycrisps, the variety could sell for far more than many other kinds of apples, making it possible for farmers to make a good deal more money on their crop.&nbsp;
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0"> Then there’s the question of storage. Honeycrisp apples can spend up to seven months in common storage (which refers to a climate at 37ºF/2.7ºC) or 10-plus months in controlled atmosphere storage, a reduced oxygen environment near freezing conditions (typically 32ºF/0ºC) that slows down the respiration rate of apples and prevents further ripening. Dr. R. Karina Gallardo, an economics professor at Washington State University, tells me that the longer the storage time, the higher the probability of disorders—which means the more likely it is that consumers purchase a poor-tasting apple.&nbsp;
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0"> An apple, however, doesn’t have to be stored very long to develop less-than-ideal flavors and textures. Though Honeycrisps are considered a good storage apple, a fruit that “stores well” could mean many things: It may look perfectly good, but doesn’t guarantee it will still taste good. “An apple can be pretty soft and mealy in six months,” Bedford says. “There’s no magic time for all apples.” There are numerous factors that can impact the quality of an apple in storage—especially when it’s a fickle variety like Honeycrisp, which requires careful tending to at every stage of its life.&nbsp;
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0"> Many farmers who invested heavily in planting Honeycrisp trees likely did not take into account just how difficult it would be to grow, harvest, and store the apples. And maybe some just decided it was worth the risk. At its most expensive, at the peak of the Honeycrisp craze in 2012 and 2013, the apple fetched a hefty price nationwide, with <a href="https://www.esquire.com/food-drink/food/a20018/honeycrisp-price-explained/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"><em>Esquire</em></a> reporting it at of $4.50 per pound in New York City.
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0"> To satiate the public’s hunger for the Honeycrisp, a once highly seasonal apple available only in Minnesota, growers have made the apple variety available year-round by planting enough fruit to store for long periods of time. Planting the Honeycrisp in Washington marked not only the shift of the apple from its place of origin—Minnesota—to a growing region it wasn’t well suited to, but was also a shift from a more small-scale, local apple industry to one that was geared towards Big Apple from the start. Growers in Washington never intended to sell their tidy little Honeycrisp crop at local markets during its short season—they wanted to supply the apples year-round, and in large enough quantities to stock supermarket shelves across the country in order to make some serious money.&nbsp;
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0"> The move to Washington facilitated the arrival of the Honeycrisp everywhere and made it possible for consumers to purchase the apple variety wherever and whenever they wanted. All the problems with the Honeycrisp became much more common once the apple was grown and distributed on such a large scale; as Cornell University pomology professor Ian Merwin told <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/twin-cities/2024/02/25/honeycrisp-apple-prices-fall-supply-quality-questions" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1">Axios</a> reporter Nick Halter, “There is no question that the quality that’s in the market is not what it was 10 years ago.” Apples are spending longer than ever in storage, and “even with advances in refrigeration in technology, that further erodes their quality.”<br>

<h2 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0"> <span> Where the Honeycrisp Stands Today </span> </h2>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0"> Apple growers very possibly over-invested in the Honeycrisp crop without truly understanding that they likely couldn’t deliver a premium product year-round on such a large scale—especially with such a capricious variety grown outside its native zone. For many consumers, the Honeycrisp crop of today has not lived up to the apple’s reputation, and for the first time ever, there is an oversupply of Honeycrisp apples. With a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/predictions-2024-honeycrisp-pricing-continue-slide-james-williams-ampsc/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1">surplus that is 71% higher</a> than the five-year average, the national average for the cost of the apple is just $1.70 per pound. It is the cheapest the apple has ever been—and possibly the least satisfying and delicious it’s ever been.&nbsp;
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0"> As Bedford noted above, it is impossible for an apple variety to be “successful” unless it is grown in Washington. But what does success even mean? Turning the Honeycrisp into yet another commodity ultimately defeats the purpose of what Bedford and Luby were trying to achieve: a truly delicious apple with excellent eating quality. The Honeycrisp is a victim of its own success, and has become exactly what Bedford and Luby despised about the variety’s predecessors: a boring commodity apple.
