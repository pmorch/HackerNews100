<p>Hello Podman community!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today is a special day for all of us – we’ve officially hit 500,000 downloads of Podman Desktop! We want to say a big thanks to each and every one of you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It feels like yesterday that Podman Desktop was merely an idea. Over the last year, the initiative started with different groups and multiple prototypes have been made. This allowed us to understand the real need and interest for a desktop GUI. More importantly, it helped define our mission and goal: enable simple workflows for developers working with containers and Kubernetes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More and more of you are leveraging Podman Desktop in your daily developer workflows and this is truly amazing!&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>What makes Podman Desktop special?</strong></h2>



<p>Podman Desktop is completely open source. Some of you have been contributing in many different ways but your feedback and your use cases are central to the way we prioritize our efforts on the tool. We love to hear from you, we love to understand the pain points you are facing in your daily workflows, and that is the core foundation of how we operate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you to all of you who have been contributing and helping the tool to be what it is today – either by reporting a bug, or proposing a pull request!&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than anything, with Podman Desktop, we aim to bridge the gaps between a developer environment and a production environment – so you can benefit from consistency and predictability to streamline your developer workflows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you still haven’t seen what Podman Desktop can do, give a look at this quick overview video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeJ_cwdoQm8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeJ_cwdoQm8</a>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>On to the next milestone: 1M downloads!</strong></h2>



<p>The journey has just begun for Podman Desktop and we are committed to improve, enhance and mature it everyday. We’ll continue to focus on experiences working with containers. In the next few months we’ll also enrich the capabilities for working with Kubernetes – and obviously continue on our mission to help you transition from containers, to pods, to Kubernetes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are interested in contributing, we would like to invite you to join the following discussions:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li><strong><span>Inspect objects in Kubernetes deployment environments</span></strong> – We will expand our Kubernetes (K8s) capabilities with a new K8s dashboard and additional K8s objects support so you can better understand and compare K8s environments. <a href="https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/discussions/3297">Review our early ideas and tell us what would help you.<br></a></li>



<li><strong><span>Install and configure additional features more easily</span></strong> – <a href="https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/discussions/3244">Check out our designs</a> for an upcoming onboarding feature to provide guided walkthroughs to help you install and configure new container capabilities.<br></li>



<li><strong><span>Find answers to questions quickly and easily</span> </strong>– <a href="https://podman-desktop.io/docs/intro">Podman Desktop’s documentation</a> is expanded and improved; what are we missing? What would you like to see us cover? <a href="https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/discussions/3319">Let us know</a>.</li>
</ol>







<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>Thank you again to our users and contributors. We’re more than happy with this milestone and we are looking forward to the next one!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Please continue to help the project, by reporting issues and feedback. You can also show your support in three ways:</p>



<ul>
<li>Give us a star on the github repository: <a href="https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop">https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop</a>&nbsp;</li>



<li>Add yourself in the list of adopters: <a href="https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md">https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md</a>&nbsp;</li>



<li>Enable telemetry data in the tool which helps us understand how to improve the tool and diagnose certain issues (the data are anonymized).</li>

<p>As the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/31/vogtle-unit-3-nuclear-reactor-long-delayed-starts-delivering-power.html">first new U.S. nuclear power reactor since 2016</a> begins operations, more Americans now say they favor expanding nuclear power in the United States than a few years ago, according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/06/28/majorities-of-americans-prioritize-renewable-energy-back-steps-to-address-climate-change/">a recent Pew Research Center survey</a>.</p>


<div>

<p>To measure public attitudes in the United States toward the use of nuclear power, we analyzed data from a survey of 10,329 U.S. adults conducted from May 30 to June 4, 2023. Everyone who took part in the survey is a member of the Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way, nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/u-s-survey-research/american-trends-panel/">ATP’s methodology</a>. Here are the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2023/06/PS_2023.06.26_climate_TOPLINE.pdf">questions used for the analysis</a>, along with responses, and its <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SR_23.08.18_nuclear-energy_methodology.pdf">methodology</a>.</p>



<p>This post also incorporates findings from a Center survey of 10,701 U.S. adults conducted March 13-19, 2023. Here are the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sr_2023.04.18_climate_topline.pdf">questions used in that survey</a>, along with responses, and its <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sr_2023.04.18_climate_methodology.pdf">methodology</a>.</p>



<p>We tracked the number of U.S. nuclear power reactors over time by analyzing data from the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) <a href="https://pris.iaea.org/PRIS/home.aspx">Power Reactor Information System</a>. The IAEA classifies a reactor as “operational” from the date of its first electrical grid connection to the date of its permanent shutdown. Reactors that face temporary outages are still categorized as operational. Annual totals exclude reactors that closed that year.</p>

</div>


<p><strong>A majority of Americans (57%) say they favor more nuclear power plants to generate electricity in the country, </strong>up from 43% who said this in 2020.</p>

<p>Americans are still far more likely to say they favor more solar power (82%) and wind power (75%) than nuclear power. All three energy sources emit no carbon.</p>



<p>Advocates for nuclear power argue it could play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions from electricity generation. Critics highlight the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-energy-nuclearpower/nuclear-energy-too-slow-too-expensive-to-save-climate-report-idUSKBN1W909J">high cost of nuclear power plant projects</a> and the complexities of handling radioactive waste.</p>



<p><strong>Support for nuclear power has increased among both parties since 2020.</strong> Half of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents now say they favor expanding nuclear power, an increase from 37% in 2020. And two-thirds of Republicans and Republican leaners now favor more nuclear power, up 14 percentage points since 2020, when 53% said they support more nuclear power.</p>

<p><strong>When asked about the federal government’s role,</strong> <strong>41% of Americans say it should encourage the production of nuclear power. </strong>Some 22% think the federal government should discourage the production of nuclear power, and 36% think it should neither encourage nor discourage it. The share of Americans who think the federal government should encourage nuclear power production is up 6 points from last year.</p>



<p>Still, a far larger share of Americans think the federal government should encourage the production of wind and solar power (66%).</p>



<h4 id="gender-partisan-differences-in-views-of-nuclear-power">Gender, partisan differences in views of nuclear power</h4>



<p>Attitudes on nuclear power production have long differed by gender and party affiliation.</p>



<p>Men are about twice as likely as women to say the federal government should encourage the production of nuclear power (54% vs. 28%). Similarly, <strong>men are far more likely than women to favor more nuclear power plants to generate electricity</strong> (71% vs. 44%).</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/09/29/concern-over-climate-and-the-environment-predominates-among-these-publics/#most-adults-across-these-publics-would-prioritize-renewable-energy-sources-over-fossil-fuel-production">Views differ by gender globally</a>, too, according to a Center survey conducted from fall 2019 to spring 2020. In 18 of the 20 survey publics, men were more likely than women to favor using more nuclear power as a source of domestic energy.</p>



<p>In the U.S., Republicans are more likely than Democrats to favor more nuclear power and to say the federal government should encourage its production.</p>

<p>Two-thirds of Republicans say they favor more nuclear power plants to generate electricity, compared with half of Democrats. </p>



<p>Republicans have supported nuclear power expansion in greater shares than Democrats each time this question has been asked since 2016.</p>



<p>The 17-point partisan difference on nuclear power is smaller than those for other energy sources, including fossil fuel sources such as offshore oil and gas drilling (48 points) and coal mining (47 points).</p>

<p><strong>The U.S. currently has </strong><a href="https://pris.iaea.org/PRIS/CountryStatistics/CountryDetails.aspx?current=US"><strong>93 nuclear power reactors</strong></a><strong>,</strong> plus one that’s <a href="https://world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Georgia-Power-takes-next-step-for-Vogtle-4">under construction in Georgia</a>. These reactors collectively generated <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3">18.2% of all U.S. electricity in 2022</a>, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.</p>



<p>Half (47) of the United States’ nuclear power reactors are in the South, while about a quarter (22) are in the Midwest. There are 18 reactors in the Northeast and six in the West, according to data from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</p>



<p><strong>The number of U.S. reactors has steadily fallen since peaking at 111 in 1990.</strong> Nine Mile Point-1, located in Scriba, New York, is the oldest U.S. nuclear power reactor still in operation. It was first connected to the power grid in November 1969. Most of the 93 current reactors began operations in the 1970s (41 reactors) or 1980s (44), according to data from the IAEA. (The IAEA classifies reactors as “operational” from their first electrical grid connection to their date of permanent shutdown.)</p>



<p>One of the many reasons nuclear power projects have dwindled in recent decades may be perceived dangers following <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/brief-history-nuclear-accidents-worldwide">nuclear accidents</a> in the U.S. and abroad. For example, the 2011 <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56252695">Fukushima Daiichi accident</a> led the Japanese government to greatly decrease its reliance on nuclear power and prompted other countries to <a href="https://www.oecd.org/publications/impacts-of-the-fukushima-daiichi-accident-on-nuclear-development-policies-9789264276192-en.htm">rethink their nuclear energy plans</a>. More recently, Russian military attacks in Ukraine have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/05/europe/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-disaster-threat-explainer-intl/index.html">raised fears of nuclear power plant accidents</a> in the area.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://getconvoy.io/blog/why-open-source/">https://getconvoy.io/blog/why-open-source/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37214342">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><div><p>Two weeks ago, we had a YC open-source founders event at the new YC office. A common question in these types of events is, “Why open source?”. It was the first question the moderator asked all the panellists, and sure, they all gave great answers! Fun fact: I met an open-source founder, and she said: we all just like open-source and try to justify it with something-something data privacy. 😂&nbsp;And it dawned on me that I hadn’t put in writing the answer to this question for Convoy, so here you go.</p>
<p>As a quick recap -- Convoy is an open-source high-performance webhooks gateway to manage webhooks end-to-end. It is designed to be an highly scalable multi-tenant webhooks gateway to support multiple backend services sending and receiving webhooks. It comes baked in with several features like retries, rate limiting, circuit breaking, customer-facing webhooks dashboards, support for both sending &amp; receiving webhooks and a lot more.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This post might include subjective opinions you may not completely agree with, but it’s our why. Ready, set, let’s go.</p>
<h3 id="technology-abstraction-or-saas-business">Technology Abstraction or SaaS Business?</h3>
<p>First and foremost, many problems in the infrastructure software domain are the necessary abstractions engineers need to do their job. This is true for many problems in the domain, like — Message Queues, Databases, API Gateways, Load Balancers, Service Discovery, Container Orchestration, etc. In these problem domains, companies oftentimes build out a managed service business over their core (open source) technology providing uptime, reliability, governance, etc., on a <a href="https://www.usagebased.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">usage-based pricing model</a> as their core revenue strategy rather than monetize over the availability of a feature or not.</p>
<p>This type of clean technology abstraction is what I believe is missing in the webhooks provider space. In another post, I will write my technical vision for webhooks. But for this post, here’s a snippet — If you simplify the problem of a webhooks service, you’re left with a message queue dedicated to webhook events. This in itself is not a SaaS business. It’s simply a necessary abstraction gap that needs filling. If you agree to the precursory premise, open-sourcing the core technology is a no-brainer; we are never returning to the Oracle closed-source proprietary databases era.</p>
<p>Technologies that are necessary abstractions to enable developers to do their job needs and should be open-sourced. It comes with the territory. I don’t want opaque binaries with a promise of their internal behaviour. I want it alongside its source code to inspect it, have a concrete understanding of how it works, and extend it if I need to. Sadly, this can come under much debate with the recent <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-adopts-business-source-license" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">license changes</a> at HashiCorp. But I do not believe this is sufficient reason to bring back proprietary infrastructure software with unnecessary sales cycles prior to usage.</p>
<h3 id="distribution">Distribution.</h3>
<p>Open source is the ultimate form of distribution for infrastructure software tools. Again, the core premise is these tools are necessary building blocks to achieve my goal. My goal can be anything from side projects to company production-grade projects. All that is important is I need this tool to achieve this objective. One advantage you get free of charge is being open-source enables the adoption of your tool to the ends of the earth. It’s always an amazing feeling interacting with engineers from various continents joining our Slack Community and asking questions about deploying &amp; using Convoy—one of the best feelings ever. ✨</p>
<p>At Convoy, our mission is simple; we genuinely want to put our technology into the hands of as many engineers as possible without having to worry about long sales cycles, data compliance issues, and being constrained to your immediate network &amp; friends. Open source helps us side-step all these problems at once, enabling engineers anywhere to utilize Convoy in the best way that fits their system architecture.</p>
<h3 id="sustainability">Sustainability.</h3>
<p>Open source is the ultimate form of sustainability. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/grow-fast-or-die-slow" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">92% of SaaS companies fail</a>, regardless of funding or growth. Failure of your business should not bring down my infrastructure nor force me to redesign my system architecture when I am not ready to do so. Providing open-source software is the highest form of care for sustainability for your users. Minor segue: at the YC event, I learned to differentiate project/market fit from product/market fit. The former describes the adoption of your project, while the latter describes the revenue of your business. Conflating the two can be erroneous.</p>
<p>At Convoy, regardless of the business of Convoy, we want the technology always to be available to developers, enabling them to fork it and ensure their system survival. As awkward as it sounds, this benefit provides sustainability even to open-source companies’ license changes. This is possible because most (if not all) license changes aren’t back-dated. Two examples that quickly come to mind are <a href="https://opensearch.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Opensearch</a> to Elastic and now <a href="https://opentf.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OpenTF</a> project to Terraform.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, the open-source companies industry is still early. RedHat clocked 20 last year. What do I think? I think many open-source companies/founders will start thinking of licensing and monetization very early in their project to prevent license change drama in their communities. This is already happening with projects like <a href="https://redpanda.com/blog/open-source" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Redpanda</a> and <a href="https://www.dragonflydb.io/blog/announcing-dragonfly" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DragonflyDB</a>. Sustainability is dear to us, and being open-source helps us achieve this.</p>
<h3 id="defensibility">Defensibility.</h3>
<p>Lastly, Open source is the ultimate form of defensibility for our business. Similar to how I described that open source helps you distribute your software to as many developers as possible. It is also an invitation to improve and build the best version of the software to fit the needs of your users. That invitation is to like-minded engineers seeking the right abstractions to solve their problems which eventually builds a community that ensures the success of your project isn’t easily toppled.</p>
<p>At Convoy, we do not want to build in a silo; being open source is the closest form of an invitation to build the best abstraction possible for developers. Here, competition is irrelevant. You focus on working with your users to craft the best product and abstraction. Nothing is sweeter. :)</p>
<p>And that’s why we chose to open-source Convoy. If you’re an open-source founder, I’m genuinely curious what your thoughts are and why you have chosen you open-source your startup’s core tech. If you have a blog post to share, that’ll be fantastic as well.</p></div></main></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Has it really been that long? Apparently so. Valve originally announced their <em>rebranding</em> of Steam Play with Proton back on August 21st, 2018. Seems like a good time for a quick reflection being halfway to a decade old now.</p>
<p>The problem: before, during and just after the original Steam Machine push developers just weren't porting many games to Linux, and on the whole really when you look back Linux gaming was in a period of mostly stagnation. Nothing much was happening. A lot of the early porting work that came along was slowly dying off since the Steam Machines didn't provide the boost Valve and Linux gamers were hoping for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Originally, “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190204114909/https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9439-QHKN-1308" target="_blank">Steam Play</a>” simply meant you could buy a game on Steam and get access to all versions of it. So if you purchased a game on Windows, you could play it on Linux if it had a Native Linux version (same again for macOS). Clearly though, that wasn't enough for what Valve had planned. So if Valve wanted to make Linux a <em>better</em> platform for people to actually use it, they needed <em>something</em> more.</p>
<p>Popular games needed to be able to run on Linux if more people were to use it, because what good is a platform for gaming if tons of the most played games weren’t compatible? As Valve saw with the Steam Machines (not the only reason of course) it doesn’t end well.</p>
<p>I remember being sat in my office at the time, going over my TODO list of various articles and games to cover, planning the week ahead. Ready to then probably go to bed and then <em>BAM</em> — out of nowhere this <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/221410/announcements/detail/1696055855739350561" target="_blank">announcement</a> comes along from Valve that basically said <em>“you're going to be hella busy, better get a lot of coffee”. </em>Valve had partnered up with <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/" target="_blank">CodeWeavers</a> and <strong>Proton</strong> was the answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proton being the name Valve gave to their fork of <a href="https://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank">Wine</a> with a bunch of added extras, and it has changed Linux gaming forever. Steam Play is more than just Proton though, be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">read my full Steam Play Proton guide</a>. <em>Side-note: John Carmack (id Software / Oculus VR / Keen Technologies) even thought Wine was the solution</em><a href="https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/298628243630723074" target="_blank"><em> </em><em>back in 2013</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Of course Proton wouldn't have been possible without all the many years of work that went into the Wine project in the first place, and everyone who contributed to Wine should be applauded for their effort. Valve has funded a lot of extra work though to get things like<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk" target="_blank"> DXVK</a> and<a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton" target="_blank"> VKD3D-Proton</a> for the translation from Direct3D to Vulkan into a state where performance can be really great! <em>Valve also funds work on Linux graphics drivers, Linux kernel work and the list goes on.</em></p>
<p>Just how much has Proton changed things though? Well, we certainly <em>wouldn't</em> have the Steam Deck if it wasn't for Proton. There's no way Valve would have released their handheld without as many games as possible, clearly learning their lesson on the failure of the Steam Machines. But as we all know, the Steam Machines burned so Proton and the Steam Deck could rise from the ashes.</p>
<p>Proton just makes a <em>lot</em> of sense. It didn't take long for Valve to expand Proton to go initially from a few select Valve-approved titles, to being able to run anything we choose to try with it. From there, Linux gaming just seemingly <em>exploded</em>. And then eventually we saw <em>why</em> Valve made Proton with the Steam Deck announcement coming less than three years later in July 2021.</p>
<p>When you look at the crowd-sourced reports on<a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank"> ProtonDB</a> over 11,000 titles are reported to work by multiple people. It's a small fraction of Steam's overall game count but ProtonDB relies on people actually going and writing a report.</p>
<p>Valve's own Deck Verified rating system <em>just</em> for the Steam Deck hit plenty of milestones since the Steam Deck's release too, now having over<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/steam-deck-hits-over-10000-verified-and-playable-games/" target="_blank"> 10,000 titles rated to be Playable or Verified</a>. Although both ProtonDB and Deck Verified include a mixture of Native Linux releases and Windows games run with Proton. The <em>point</em> is - being on Linux now for a gamer means quite often a huge amount of your games do actually "just work". It's <em>almost</em> magical.</p>
<p>The real number of games playable on Linux will never be truly known though, because on Steam there's many tens of thousands of games and a lot of them will likely "just work" with Proton if they don’t have a Native Linux build available…and many more are releasing every week. This is a truly incredible place to be in. When you think about Linux and Steam Deck together having <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/linux-overtakes-macos-users-on-steam-thanks-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank">just less than a 2%</a> user share on Steam overall — these are some insane numbers for game compatibility for a niche platform.</p>
<p>Thanks to Proton, I've been able to discover a <em>ton</em> of new favourite games, some I would never have played before. Games like Deep Rock Galactic, God of War, Death Stranding, Baldur’s Gate 3, Brotato, Beat Saber and so on. You get the idea, there’s a truly ridiculous selection of games available and at times it’s a little <em>paralysing</em> scrolling through my Steam Library deciding what to play — a delightfully annoying problem to have huh?</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18291519851692554532gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18291519851692554532gol1.jpg"></a><em>Pictured - Baldur's Gate 3, shot taken on Kubuntu</em></p>
<p>Gamers using Linux (be it desktop or Steam Deck) in 2023 are now in a place where they can get <strong>excited</strong> alongside friends who use Windows or traditional consoles, because they know there's a good probable chance at release that whatever new exciting game coming out will work without much trouble.</p>
<p>Proton is far from perfect though and it does mean in a few ways that Valve, CodeWeavers and everyone else working on it are playing catch-up with Microsoft on compatibility and whatever changes Microsoft suddenly decides to announce that affects gaming. That, and how many different ways game developers can abuse various APIs to do things in weird ways. Valve and co are a dedicated bunch though, <em>constantly</em> fixing up issues from AAA games like<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/proton-experimental-beta-gets-steam-deck-performance-fix-for-elden-ring/" target="_blank"> ELDEN RING</a> where Valve quickly worked to implement optimizations, same again for problems with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/valve-fix-dead-space-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Dead Space</a> to the likes of<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/codeweavers-blog-about-their-linux-steam-deck-work-on-proton-with-pooshooter/" target="_blank"> PooShooter: Toilet Invaders</a> (what a fun highlight that was eh?). There's also the constant third-party launcher breakage, that Valve are also fixing up each time it happens.</p>
<p>Valve produce updates to Proton <em>constantly</em> to improve compatibility, with over 300 revisions to the main <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">changelog</a> (although some a minor text corrections) it's clear to see how much work goes into it. With various new main versions of Proton through 4, 5, 6, 7 now onto 8 and multiple updates to Proton Experimental almost <em>every</em> month.</p>
<p>So here's to Proton, the magnificent tech that allows playing all kinds of games across Linux systems from desktop to Steam Deck and wherever else you decide to stick Linux. Nice one Valve. Cheers.</p>

Most large enterprises are still trying to analytically sort what “AI” means for them, and are still many quarters from embracing this new technology.</p><p><strong>4 Waves of AI Adoption</strong></p><p>Indeed, there are likely at least 4 waves of AI to consider in these early days.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e546148-0348-4f04-b9ac-80f696579aa5_2210x1124.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e546148-0348-4f04-b9ac-80f696579aa5_2210x1124.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e546148-0348-4f04-b9ac-80f696579aa5_2210x1124.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e546148-0348-4f04-b9ac-80f696579aa5_2210x1124.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e546148-0348-4f04-b9ac-80f696579aa5_2210x1124.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e546148-0348-4f04-b9ac-80f696579aa5_2210x1124.png" width="1456" height="741" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7e546148-0348-4f04-b9ac-80f696579aa5_2210x1124.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:741,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:667092,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e546148-0348-4f04-b9ac-80f696579aa5_2210x1124.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e546148-0348-4f04-b9ac-80f696579aa5_2210x1124.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e546148-0348-4f04-b9ac-80f696579aa5_2210x1124.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e546148-0348-4f04-b9ac-80f696579aa5_2210x1124.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Wave 1: GenAI native companies</strong><span>. ChatGPT, Midjourney, Character.AI, Stable Diffusion, Github copilot, and other early launches that have now gained significant revenue and user traction. Obviously there are some great ML companies that pre-date GenAI that continue to participate in the current era (Hugging Face, Runway, Scale, WandB are a few that come to mind).</span></p><p><strong>Wave 2 (current wave): Early startup adopters and fast mid-market incumbents.</strong><span> This is the first wave of startups to launch on top of GPT-3.5/4 like Perplexity, Langchain, Harvey or others. In parallel, a small number of founder led multi-billion companies like Navan, Notion, Quora, Replit, and Zapier launched AI-powered products quickly and are the early adopters of the wave. Microsoft, Adobe, and Google are notable outliers as very large enterprise moving fast to AI - Microsoft likely due to its inside track with OpenAI, and Adobe as diffusion models tend to be cheaper and simpler to train than the large scale LLMs.</span></p><p><strong>Wave 3 (coming soon): Next wave of startups currently being founded.</strong><span> It will be exciting to see what is in this mix and may include new formats like voice and video in addition to using natural language in more verticals and more ways, as well as new types of infrastructure. Companies like </span><a href="https://elevenlabs.io/" rel="">Eleven</a><span> Labs/</span><a href="https://lmnt.com/" rel="">LMNT</a><span>/LFG Labs, </span><a href="https://www.braintrustdata.com/" rel="">Braintrust</a><span>, and many more will provide incremental experiences. There is a big wave of new startups coming. The current YC batch alone appears to have a 100 or more AI startups….</span></p><p><strong>Wave 4 (coming 2024/2025?): First big enterprise adopters.</strong><span> Since enterprise planning and build cycles are so long, anticipate the first really products (versus demos or prototypes) from larger companies other than MSFT, Adobe, Google, Meta to start to show up in a year or two. This is when revenue to AI infra companies will start to ramp significantly relative to today, when hype will peak, and we will see further accelerated investment in AI.</span></p><p><strong>The Future Is Bright</strong></p><p><span>There is enormous potential for this new wave of tech to impact humanity. For example, Google’s</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09617.pdf" rel=""> MedPaLM2</a><span> model outperforms human physicians to such a strong degree that having medical experts RLHF the model makes it worse (!).</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab5c2822-dab3-4311-9085-6c1788c57bb5_1314x624.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab5c2822-dab3-4311-9085-6c1788c57bb5_1314x624.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab5c2822-dab3-4311-9085-6c1788c57bb5_1314x624.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab5c2822-dab3-4311-9085-6c1788c57bb5_1314x624.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab5c2822-dab3-4311-9085-6c1788c57bb5_1314x624.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab5c2822-dab3-4311-9085-6c1788c57bb5_1314x624.png" width="1314" height="624" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ab5c2822-dab3-4311-9085-6c1788c57bb5_1314x624.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:624,&quot;width&quot;:1314,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:389886,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab5c2822-dab3-4311-9085-6c1788c57bb5_1314x624.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab5c2822-dab3-4311-9085-6c1788c57bb5_1314x624.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab5c2822-dab3-4311-9085-6c1788c57bb5_1314x624.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab5c2822-dab3-4311-9085-6c1788c57bb5_1314x624.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Given the strong potential it will be exciting to see all the immense innovation in education, healthcare, enterprise and consumer software, and other aspects of life coming via this tech breakthrough. </p><p>We are only 8-9 months since chatGPT woke the world to this new era of AI, and exciting times are ahead as we follow this tech discontinuity down our timeline.

The logic was this: the outcome for blog posts is a heavy-tailed statistical distribution—most pieces will be read by barely anyone, but a small subset of outliers will do hundreds if not thousands of times better than average. Ben Kuhn has </span><a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/outliers/" rel="">a good post detailing this idea</a><span>. He writes:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>The most important thing to remember when sampling from heavy-tailed distributions is that </span><em>getting lots of samples improves outcomes a ton</em><span>.</span></p><p>In a light-tailed context—say, picking fruit at the grocery store—it’s fine to look at two or three apples and pick the best-looking one. It would be completely unreasonable to, for example, look through the entire bin of apples for that one apple that’s just a bit better than anything you’ve seen so far.</p><p>In a heavy-tailed context, the reverse is true. [...] Every additional sample you draw increases the chance that you get an outlier.</p></blockquote><p>Kuhn goes on to give the same advice I got from my writer friends:</p><blockquote><p>Often, you’ll have a choice between spending time on optimizing one sample or drawing a second sample—for instance, editing a blog post you’ve already written vs. writing a second post[.] Some amount of optimization is worth it, but in my experience, most people are way over-indexed on optimization and under-indexed on drawing more samples.</p></blockquote><p><span>I’ve now written 37 blog posts and I no longer think this is true. Each time I’ve given in to my impulse to “optimize” a piece it has performed massively better (in terms of how much it’s been read, how many subscribers it’s generated, and, most importantly, the number of </span><a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query" rel="">interesting people brought into my world</a><span>). I’ll analyze the numbers in more detail in a little bit, but the general picture is this: if I spend twice as long working on a piece, it does on average four times better. (If I include outliers, the ambitious pieces do eight times better than the normal pieces.) The work I put in has </span><em>increasing returns</em><span>—the more time I spend writing, the bigger difference each additional hour does.</span></p><p>This conclusion is based on a minuscule sample, so take it with a grain of salt. But doesn’t it make sense that working on blog posts should have increasing returns? The distribution of outcomes for blog posts looks like this, with more successful posts on the left:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

starting from a place where the rate of change is higher than if you start a new piece. So why waste that and pull a new sample?</p><p><span>There is an element of luck, too. Some pieces just do inexplicably well. Those who argue that you shouldn’t overwork a piece seem to be saying that luck swamps hard work. For me, that is not true. Hard work trumps luck. It is better for me to work hard on a few pieces rather than do more pieces and hope for luck.</span></p><p>Let’s look at the numbers from my Substack so you can get a sense of what I’m basing my intuition on.</p><p><span>I am, I reckon, a slow writer. Looking at the statistics, the vast majority of blog posts take somewhere between 2-7 hours to write (which I wouldn’t call over-optimizing). I need more like 20-70 hours. Sometimes, however, I stare into the mist that rolls in off the ocean and I tell myself to get with the times and write something fast, real fast! and then I hammer out a piece in what feels like a frantic hurry—which, when I look at the time stamps, turns out to be 10-20 hours. Let’s call the pieces that take me ten hours “normal essays” (because they at least </span><em>approach </em><span>the normal time range) and the others “effort pieces”.</span></p><p><span>Here is a box graph showing how many new subscribers</span></p><p><span> I get by writing a normal essay compared to an effort piece:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F348468ed-c7eb-475b-8ef7-f7a793b69556_183x380.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F348468ed-c7eb-475b-8ef7-f7a793b69556_183x380.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F348468ed-c7eb-475b-8ef7-f7a793b69556_183x380.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F348468ed-c7eb-475b-8ef7-f7a793b69556_183x380.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F348468ed-c7eb-475b-8ef7-f7a793b69556_183x380.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F348468ed-c7eb-475b-8ef7-f7a793b69556_183x380.png" width="183" height="380" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/348468ed-c7eb-475b-8ef7-f7a793b69556_183x380.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:380,&quot;width&quot;:183,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F348468ed-c7eb-475b-8ef7-f7a793b69556_183x380.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F348468ed-c7eb-475b-8ef7-f7a793b69556_183x380.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F348468ed-c7eb-475b-8ef7-f7a793b69556_183x380.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F348468ed-c7eb-475b-8ef7-f7a793b69556_183x380.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>You can read it this way. If I have forty hours to write, I can spend ten hours on four pieces and get on average ~92 subscribers, or I can spend twenty hours each on two pieces and get ~403.

I’ve not been surprised so far. When I follow the wisdom that says you should have a high cadence, my subscriber growth falls by half. I can either write ambitious pieces that I’m proud of, or I can approach the normal internet ethos and lose ground. I’m not particularly obsessed with growing the blog, but I’m happy that worldly incentives for me align with being an artisan rather than a content producer.&nbsp;</p><p>My stat skills are rusty, so I’m not sure how robust these results are. The sample is small enough that you’d think it was a social psychology study. But given the big effect size, I guess the results are significant even though the sample is minuscule?

He has </span><a href="https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/write-faster-130" rel="">a piece encouraging people to “just hit the fucking keyboard,”</a><span> and he claims he wrote it in 30 minutes, and if he’d done “it a little faster it probably would’ve been a little better.” I like that essay.</span></p><p><span>My impression is that Sasha feels pretty miserable when he tries to do what I do; he gets blocked and contrived and starts chainsmoking when he works hard on a piece. It seems a lot of people feel that way. And if the reason you write fast is that it is the only way you </span><em>can</em><span> write or the only way you can write without censoring yourself—then I think that is a wonderful reason to write fast. If you try to push a piece to a level of excellence that is beyond you, you will not finish any pieces at all. And that is not going anywhere. You need to write a lot to figure out the craft, and you need to finish and publish pieces, too, because there are certain things you only learn that way. So if you feel blocked, by all means, lower the expectations and hit the keyboard with both hands like a bongo. But if you lower your expectations more than you </span><em>have</em><span> to, you are missing out. That is all I’m saying. People will be more willing to share your post if you’ve done a meticulous job, and that compounds. Also, there are things you can only learn by going hard.&nbsp;</span></p><p>So that is a caveat. Don’t optimize pieces so hard that you hate yourself and give up writing.</p><p><span>I should also say something about what I mean by “optimizing” a piece. I’m not talking about fretting over adjectives or whether to move a comma or not. I hit the keyboard almost as fast as Sasha—I do about a thousand words a day and that is on top of working and homeschooling my daughters—it’s just that I cut nearly everything. When I’m writing, I’m looking for weaknesses in my </span><em>thinking</em><span> (which I can usually only spot once I’ve my thoughts on the screen). I write a draft. I critique it; I get people more mean than me to critique it; I get people who are experts on strange things to critique it from their strange perspectives. Then I go and research and rewrite my thoughts again and again as my understanding evolves. I’m transforming my thinking. Then I do a light edit for tone. I leave a few misspellings.</span></p><p>When I started, I thought this obsessiveness—spending months on pieces and then throwing half of them away—would sentence me to obscurity as a writer. The reason I wrote like this wasn’t because of the intuition outlined in this essay. I did it because I couldn’t help myself. I like everything around me to be well-crafted and beautiful, and I don’t mind feeling frustrated at times to make that happen.</p><p>I guess what I’m trying to say in this essay is: I’m awed and surprised and deeply pleased that this turned out to be a good strategy. You don’t have to be a content farm to find a community of readers; you can just put your heart into making unreasonably thorough stuff.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/effort-pieces?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/effort-pieces?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><em><span> read an early draft and helped me cut the weakest part.</span></em></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

SDXL is actually two models: a base model and an optional <a href="https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-1.0">refiner model</a> which siginficantly improves detail, and since the refiner has no speed overhead I strongly recommend using it if possible.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2023/08/stable-diffusion-xl-wrong/sdxl_comparison_hu7f68f586d4596602386cf35420774188_17704_320x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2023/08/stable-diffusion-xl-wrong/sdxl_comparison_hu7f68f586d4596602386cf35420774188_17704_768x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2023/08/stable-diffusion-xl-wrong/sdxl_comparison.webp 886w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2023/08/stable-diffusion-xl-wrong/sdxl_comparison.webp" alt="Comparisons of the relative quality of Stable Diffusion models.

With a L4 GPU, each 1024x1024 image takes about 22 seconds to generate and you can only generate one image at a time on midrange GPUs unlike previous Stable Diffusion models since it uses 100% of the GPU’s power, so some more patience is necessary. You <em>can</em> generate at a smaller resolution faster but it is strongly not recommended because the results are much, much worse.</p><p>diffusers also implemented support for two new features I haven’t experimented with in my previous Stable Diffusion posts: <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/using-diffusers/weighted_prompts">prompt weighting</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/training/dreambooth">Dreambooth LoRA</a> training and inference. Prompt weighting support with diffusers leverages the Python library <a href="https://github.com/damian0815/compel">compel</a> to allow weighting of terms more mathematically. You can add any number of <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> to a given word to increase or decrease its “importance” in the resulting positional text embeddings, and therefore the final generation. You can also wrap phrases: for example, if you are generating <code>San Francisco landscape by Salvador Dali, oil on canvas</code> and it does a photorealistic San Francisco instead, you can wrap the artistic medium such as <code>San Francisco landscape by Salvador Dali, (oil on canvas)+++</code> to get Stable Diffusion to behave as expected. In my testing, it fixes most of the prompt difficulty introduced in Stable Diffusion 2.0 onward, especially with a higher <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598">classifier-free guidance</a> value (by default, <code>guidance_scale</code> is 7.5; I like to use 13)</p><blockquote><p><em>All generated examples from the LoRA models in this blog post use a <code>guidance_scale</code> of 13.</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="lora-the-explorer">LoRA the Explorer</h2><p>But what’s most important is <a href="https://dreambooth.github.io/">Dreambooth</a> LoRA support, which is what makes bespoke Stable Diffusion models possible. Dreambooth is a technique to finetune Stable Diffusion on a very small set of source images and a trigger keyword to allow the use a “concept” from those images in other contexts given the keyword.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2023/08/stable-diffusion-xl-wrong/teaser_static_hu67055eecdd74e88adcf6c40d8410c1bc_53032_320x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2023/08/stable-diffusion-xl-wrong/teaser_static_hu67055eecdd74e88adcf6c40d8410c1bc_53032_768x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2023/08/stable-diffusion-xl-wrong/teaser_static_hu67055eecdd74e88adcf6c40d8410c1bc_53032_1024x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2023/08/stable-diffusion-xl-wrong/teaser_static.webp 1650w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2023/08/stable-diffusion-xl-wrong/teaser_static.webp" alt="Demo image of how Dreambooth works. via Google"><figcaption><p>Demo image of how Dreambooth works. <a href="https://dreambooth.github.io/">via Google</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Training Stable Diffusion itself, even the smaller models, requires many expensive GPUs training for hours. That’s where <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA">LoRAs</a> come in: instead, a small adapter to the visual model is trained, which can be done on a single cheap GPU in 10 minutes, and the quality of the final model + LoRA is comparable to a full finetune (colloquially, when people refer to finetuning Stable Diffusion, it usually means creating a LoRA). Trained LoRAs are a discrete small binary file, making them easy to share with others or on repositories such as <a href="https://civitai.com/">Civitai</a>. A minor weakness with LoRAs is that you can only have one active at a time: it’s possible to merge multiple LoRAs to get the benefits of all of them but it’s a delicate science.</p><p>Before Stable Diffusion LoRAs became more widespread, there was <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01618">textual inversion</a>, which allows the text encoder to learn a concept, but it takes hours to train and the results can be unwieldy. In a <a href="https://minimaxir.com/2022/09/stable-diffusion-ugly-sonic/">previous post</a>, I trained a textual inversion on the memetic <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ugly-sonic">Ugly Sonic</a>, as he was not in Stable Diffusion’s source dataset and therefore he would be unique. The generation results were mixed.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2023/08/stable-diffusion-xl-wrong/ugly_sonic_ti_hu0a2d6f8f06743f432175198b6f69b9e0_73978_320x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2023/08/stable-diffusion-xl-wrong/ugly_sonic_ti_hu0a2d6f8f06743f432175198b6f69b9e0_73978_768x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2023/08/stable-diffusion-xl-wrong/ugly_sonic_ti.webp 768w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2023/08/stable-diffusion-xl-wrong/ugly_sonic_ti.webp" alt="Ugly Sonic, but not the good kind of ugly."><figcaption><p>Ugly Sonic, but not the good kind of ugly.</p></figcaption></figure><p>I figured training a LoRA on Ugly Sonic would be a good test case for SDXL’s potential. Fortunately, Hugging Face provides a <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/dreambooth">train_dreambooth_lora_sdxl.py script</a> for training a LoRA using the SDXL base model which works out of the box although I tweaked the parameters a bit.

I thought that the <code>wrong</code> LoRA trick would just improve the quality and clarity of the generated image, but it appears the LoRA is <em>making SDXL behave smarter</em> and more faithful to the spirit of the prompt. At a technical level, the negative prompt sets the area of the latent space where the diffusion process starts; this area is the same for both the base model using the <code>wrong</code> negative prompt and the LoRA which uses the <code>wrong</code> negative prompt. My intuition is that the LoRA reshapes this undesirable area of the vast highdimensional latent space to be more similar to the starting area, so it’s unlikely normal generation will hit it and therefore be improved.</p><p>Training on SDXL on bad images in order to improve it is technically a form of <a href="https://openai.com/research/learning-from-human-preferences">Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</a> (RLHF): the <a href="https://openai.com/research/instruction-following">same technique</a> used to make ChatGPT as powerful as it is. While OpenAI uses reinforcement learning to improve the model from positive user interactions and implicitly reducing negative behavior, here I use <em>negative</em> user interactions (i.e. selecting knowingly bad images) to implicitly increase positive behavior.

    <p>We always thought of the Macintosh as a fast computer, since its 68000 microprocessor was effectively 10 times faster than an Apple II, but our Achilles heel was the floppy disk.  We had limited RAM, so it was often necessary to load data from the floppy, but there we were no faster than an Apple II.  Once we had real applications going, it was clear the floppy disk was going to be a significant bottleneck.</p><p>

	One of the things that bothered Steve Jobs the most was the time that it took to boot when the Mac was first powered on. It could take a couple of minutes, or even more, to test memory, initialize the operating system, and load the Finder.  One afternoon, Steve came up with an original way to motivate us to make it faster.	</p><p>

	Larry Kenyon was the engineer working on the disk driver and file system.  Steve came into his cubicle and started to exhort him. "The Macintosh boots too slowly.  You've got to make it faster!"</p><p>

	Larry started to explain about some of the places where he thought that he could improve things, but Steve wasn't interested.  He continued, "You know, I've been thinking about it.  How many people are going to be using the Macintosh?  A million?  No, more than that.  In a few years, I bet five million people will be booting up their Macintoshes at least once a day."</p><p>

	"Well, let's say you can shave 10 seconds off of the boot time.  Multiply that by five million users and thats 50 million seconds, every single day. Over a year, that's probably dozens of lifetimes.  So if you make it boot ten seconds faster, you've saved a dozen lives.  That's really worth it, don't you think?"</p><p>

	We were pretty motivated to make the software go as fast as we could anyway, so I'm not sure if this pitch had much effect, but we thought it was pretty humorous, and we did manage to shave more than ten seconds off the boot time over the next couple of months.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My academic training is in Fine Art, painting, and printmaking. My professional career for the past 20 years has been in software engineering, including machine learning. This makes me uniquely situated to <strike>panic about</strike> discuss image-generative AI systems like Midjourney, DALL-E, etc.</p> <p>This essay comes to you in two parts (both of which are right here on this page).</p> <p><a href="#part1">Part I</a> is a mostly-un-opinionated technical description of how one popular branch of AI image generation currently works. If you’re already familiar enough with stable diffusion to understand the terms “latent space” and “text transformer,” you can skip ahead.</p> <p><a href="#part2">Part II</a> is a very opinionated prediction of how this technology will be successfully used and by whom.</p> <h2 id="-part-i-stable-diffusion"><a name="part1"></a> PART I: Stable diffusion</h2> <h3 id="i-a-the-latent-space">I a) The Latent Space</h3> <p>If you want to talk about colors, there are more and less useful ways to name them for different tasks. Take the color “pinkish purplish autumn mist” and make it a little warmer; what color is that? Mix a little ultramarine, a little alizarin crimson, a tiny dot of cadmium yellow, and a good blob of titanium white. Make <em>that</em> a little warmer; what color is that? Take the RGB color <code>234, 182, 227</code>, and make it a little warmer; what color is that? Or the HSV color <code>308° 22° 92°</code>. Or the Lch color <code>80/30/330</code>.</p> <p>When we use lists of numbers to name points in a physical space, we don’t do so randomly.</p> <p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/vector_space.png" alt="Several points plotted on an x and y axis, labeled with the numbers (5, 4), (6, 5) and (-5, -10)"></p> <p>We pick a numbering to ensure that when the numbers are close, the locations they name are close, and when the numbers are very different, the locations they name are far apart.</p> <p>We can also use a list of numbers to describe a non-physical space, like the space of colors:</p> <p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/rgb_space.png" alt="A cube of colors representing all of RGB space, with red increasing to the left, green to the top, and blue into the picture plane"></p> <p>And we want the same rules to apply: similar colors should have similar numbers, and similar numbers represent similar colors. There are many ways to give colors numbers — RGB, Lch, CMYK — and each numbering results in slightly different relationships between those colors. The goal is always “put similar things near to one another,” but we might define “similar things” in a variety of subtly different ways.</p> <p>The numbers don’t contain the appearance of colors nor the literal pigments they’re made from — it’s a labeling system, not a filing system. The numbers for a color are both a label and a set of instructions: mix this much red light, this much green light, and this much blue light, and you’ll get the color that these numbers label.</p> <p>Words are more complicated than colors. Still, one could imagine assigning every word a bunch of numbers — perhaps hundreds, instead of just three — in such a way that “mom” and “dad” have similar numbers, and “mom” and “prestidigitation” are further apart.</p> <p>Researchers have used AI to take lots and lots of text and (by assuming that words that appear near each other in text are related in some way) build a space of words that’s like that.</p> <p>Whole images are even more complicated than single words or colors, but (by using thousands of numbers) we can imagine “spaces” where similar images are represented by similar lists of numbers.</p> <p>We <em>could</em> do that by listing every RGB color of every pixel in an image — that will make some similar images close to each other! There are downsides, though. That method takes <em>millions</em> of numbers. Worse, some similar pictures won’t be near to one another at all: for instance, the RGB pixels in a picture of a black cat and the RGB pixels in a picture of a white cat will be very, very different, even if they’re otherwise very similar pictures of cats.</p> <p>So how do we build a useful space for images? It’s one thing to assume words that appear near one another are similar because the same word gets used in millions of different situations, with <em>heaps</em> of nearby words. Most images only get used once, and maybe not near any other images at all!</p> <p>We can <em>borrow</em> our latent space of words, though: Lots of pictures have captions, labels, or words nearby. Researchers have used AI to build image spaces where pictures with similar <em>captions</em> are near one another. Pictures labeled “cat” are near to each other and pictures labeled “car” are near to each other, and pictures labeled “Miyizaki cat-bus” are somewhere between.</p> <p>In generative AI research, these image-spaces space is called image “latent spaces.”</p> <p>A latent space can give you a list of numbers that approximates any image you might ever want to see, and every random uninterpretable image, too. It’s Borges’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel">Library of Babel</a> but for pictures.</p> <p>How do we navigate that space full of sense and nonsense to find the numbers for images we want to see?</p> <h3 id="i-b-stable-diffusion">I b) Stable diffusion</h3> <p>(Understand that what I’m about to describe, called stable diffusion, isn’t the only way to accomplish this, but it’s a popular one)</p> <p>Imagine seeing a picture of a cat on a staticky television: If you squint, you can make out the cat. If you wanted to, you could paint out the static and reveal the cat more clearly.</p> <p>Imagine seeing a cat behind a <em>lot</em> of static. You could squint, sketch in some lines, squint at those lines, and probably get a picture of a cat, though not exactly the same picture of a cat.</p> <p>And maybe you can imagine seeing pure static and convincing yourself there’s a cat in there somewhere, and with a lot of squinting, slowly teasing out a staticky picture of a cat, then a less staticky one, and then a clear picture of a cat.</p> <p>This is stable diffusion: We took millions of images, made them a little noisy, put them in latent space, and trained the computer to clean them up. And then, we took the noisy images, made them noisier, and trained the computer to make them less noisy. And we made those noisier, and then even noisier, until the images were obliterated, and the computer could, step by step, hallucinate its way back to <em>some</em> image. Not necessarily a good one, or a useful one, but a non-noisy image.</p> <p>We can also take our word space and train the computer to try and associate an image in image-latent-space to some words in word-latent-space and say how likely an image is to have a particular caption. A picture of a cat is likely to have the caption “my cute kitty mister french fry” and unlikely to have the caption “the engine from a 1959 Austin Healey.”</p> <p>The last piece of the puzzle is called “cross attention,” which is a fancy way of saying, “glue several AI systems together, so they can do two things at once.” In particular, we can ask the computer to remove some static from an image AND nudge that image to be more likely to be captioned with some specific text.</p> <p>And that’s it — that’s generative AI.</p> <p>Note some important things:</p> <ul> <li>while every image in the training set is representable by some numbers in latent space, the images themselves are not there in any specific way.</li> <li>To steer the process, the words you type get turned into points in a word latent space, which then gets retranslated into a movement in <em>image</em> latent space. That’s hard! And making small adjustments to the result using just words can be <em>very</em> hard!</li> <li>The kinds of images that are very common — statistically likely — get organized in bigger and more well-organized parts of latent space.</li> <li>There are other systems for steering the denoising process — using text labels is just one of them — but all of them involve cross-attention between the denoising and some other goal.</li> </ul> <p>A test of understanding: why does this produce extra fingers and deformed hands? The wrong way of thinking: every input image the model has trained on has correct hands, so it should learn to draw correct hands! The latent space describes <em>every possible image</em>. The nudge away from noise prioritizes clarity. The nudge towards a text label is satisfied by any image that would best be labeled by that text. Image captions rarely mention people’s hands, especially not with correct and incorrect numbers of fingers. There’s not much pressure toward perfect hands, and adding negative labels like “no deformed hands” relies on a very small number of images out there labeled “deformed hands.” (You might have better luck with a negative label for “polydactyly” since that label correlates very strongly to extra fingers) Most generative systems have separate components specifically to correct faces because the same issue applies; the core system is content if there’s something face-like, while our eyes are very picky about faces being correct, with the eyes pointed in the same direction most of the time.</p> <p>A test of understanding: why does adding an artist’s name, like James Gurney, produce better images overall? Most image captions are nouns: a person, an object — the picture’s focal point. The background can be nonsense; if the foreground is a teapot, it’s fair to caption it as “a teapot.” Non-teapot parts of the image aren’t under much pressure. An artist’s style is a gestalt; it doesn’t exist in just one part of the image, but the whole thing; every pixel is under correlated pressure, so a coherent outcome is a little more likely.</p> <h2 id="-part-ii-who-should-use-ai-image-generation-and-how"><a name="part2"></a> PART II: Who should use AI image generation, and how</h2> <p>There are some opinions here that will be unpopular with my artist friends. Some will be unpopular with technologists or neophilic managers. I certainly don’t want you to think I am <em>pleased</em> about any of these opinions, or that I <em>want</em> them to come to pass; these are simply my predictions based on a goodish understanding of both generative AI and traditional image-making.</p> <p><strong>An opinion popular with creatives: Physical media artists will keep their jobs.</strong></p> <p>The human desire for real paintings, sculptures, woodcuts, embroideries, and so on isn’t going to vanish.</p> <p>I don’t have much to say about that; I mostly mention it so we can set that segment of artists aside and concentrate on the larger swath of commercial image-makers.</p> <p><strong>An opinion popular with tech and unpopular with creatives: The output of physical media will continue to be used in training generative AIs.</strong></p> <p>I absolutely understand the desire to prevent this. Knowing your work has been used without permission to train a computer to replace people’s livelihoods is extremely violating. But understanding the technical basis, I don’t see any plausible way to outlaw it while still allowing fair use in all the ways human artists have been for thousands of years. Images similar to those used to build the latent space may be <em>recoverable</em> with the right prompt and some luck, but they’re not inherently there, any more than my memory of an Andy Warhol is inherently a copyright violation. I can sell Andy Warhol pastiches I make based on that memory. I can augment my memory by having a morgue file of images to train my memory on.</p> <p>If you have a vision for how this can be structured legally, restricting ML uses of imagery without restricting human uses, I’d love to hear about it!</p> <p><strong>An opinion popular with tech-loving managers and unpopular with creatives: Generative AI will replace a slice of illustration and writing: in particular, the kind where the content doesn’t actually matter:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>This blog post needs a header image that’s vaguely related, not because it needs illustration but to fit the page layout.</p> </blockquote> <p>Or</p> <blockquote> <p>This spammy site needs a new blog post once a week for SEO reasons.</p> </blockquote> <p>No one from one end of the process to the final consumer particularly cares about the image or the text as long as it doesn’t stand out; it is furniture.</p> <p>This kind of work never paid particularly well and is now rapidly vanishing. My heart goes out to the people suffering because this work is vanishing, but I also can’t see any way out, even with much stronger legal regulation of generative AI than I expect we’ll ever see.</p> <p>Why only that slice?</p> <p>If you’ve ever used a generative system, I can pretty much guarantee that you spent an embarrassing amount of time making tiny adjustments to your prompt and retrying. Producing a compelling image with generative AI is pretty easy; maybe one in ten images it generates will make you say, “Wow, cool!” But producing a specific image with generative AI is sometimes almost impossible.</p> <p>If you visit (often NSFW, beware!) showcases of generated images like <a href="https://civitai.com/images">civitai</a>, where you can see and compare them to the text prompts used in their creation, you’ll find they’re often using massive prompts, many parts of which don’t appear anywhere in the image. These aren’t small differences — often, entire concepts like “a mystical dragon” are prominent in the prompt but <em>nowhere</em> in the image. These users are playing a gacha game, a picture-making slot machine. They’re writing a prompt with lots of interesting ideas and then pulling the arm of the slot machine until they win… something. A compelling image, but not really the image they were asking for.</p> <p>Why is it so hard to get what you want?</p> <p>Let’s return to the technical discussion for a second.</p> <p>Text is a difficult way to steer an image because while the text latent space is related to the image latent space, there are still multiple translation steps: from the actual prompt to the text latent space to a function in the image latent space. The process can only accommodate so much text at a time (usually ~75 words; if there are more than that, you must break the prompt into separate guiding systems in cross-attention). OK. Are there better ways to direct image generation to have specific results?</p> <p>Yes! It’s much easier to translate an image into a latent space constraint. Images translate very well into image latent space; that’s what image latent space is for. Here are some ways folks have invented to prompt image generation using images rather than words</p> <ul> <li>Create an image that would reduce to the same line art as another image</li> <li>Create an image that would reduce to the same depth map as was pulled from another image</li> <li>Create an image with matching poses pulled for another image</li> <li>Create an image whose style matches another image even though the content differs</li> <li>match perspective lines of another image</li> <li>match the colors palette of another image</li> </ul> <p>These are all very powerful constraints that can exert precise control over the content and composition of a generated image.</p> <p>The only challenge in using them is: where do all these guiding images come from? Who can take the time to understand the concepts we want illustrations of and turn them into a line drawing, a sketch of poses, or a style? Is there some existing job title for that?</p> <p><strong>An opinion popular with creatives and unpopular with techy managers: Generative AI isn’t much use for sophisticated needs if there isn’t an illustrator involved.</strong></p> <p>I believe that will continue to hold true even for future versions of Midjourney, DALL-E, and so on; I think the amount of text they can handle will increase, and the quality and resolution of images they produce will increase, but the fundamental challenge of getting specific imagery is not going to vanish without more fundamental changes in the approach.</p> <p><strong>Finally, an opinion popular with no one: Commercial illustrators will keep their jobs, but will mostly need to learn to use AI as a part of their workflow to maintain a higher pace of work.</strong></p> <p>This <em>doesn’t</em> mean illustrators will stop drawing and become prompt engineers. That will waste an immense amount of training and gain very little. Instead, I foresee illustrators concentrating even more on capturing the core features of an image, letting generative AI fill in details, and then correcting those details as necessary.</p> <p>Here’s a process for digital painting that I’ve tested and found… plausible:</p> <ul> <li>Produce a line drawing traditionally, focusing on the composition and key ideas</li> <li>Have the generative AI suggest a dozen potential approaches to color and lighting; pick one or two</li> <li>Paint almost entirely over those AI generated pixels, adjusting and correcting the color to suit my vision</li> </ul> <p>Obviously, this is not a workable approach for artists that put great care and emotion into their color choices. I don’t think there <em>will</em> be any one approach that works for all artists. But for artists working on deadlines, I foresee them using AI to fill in whatever step is the least important and most tedious: crowd scenes, cityscapes, vegetation. Just like a blog post header image is furniture for the page, there is furniture for many images — not important, but still necessary. For better or worse, that furniture is becoming the territory of generative AI.</p> <p>The more concerning problem is that while generative AI <em>research</em> is heading in this direction, offering more and more ways to direct image generation using image inputs, the products that are entering the market are not easy to slot into an illustrator’s workflow at all. All my experiments have been done running open-data models on my own computer in order to have useful levels of control.</p> <p>I have more to say on the subject of machine creativity and also the gacha-like nature of generative AI, but I think it best to leave this post here, with that vision of commercial illustration yet to come, and the hope that generative AI products will start catering to it.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>What helps a programming language gain traction? Patrick Martin remembers why he used to use Delphi.</p>

<h2>
 But first what is Delphi?
</h2>

<p>
 It is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.
</p>

<h3>
 And why write about it?
</h3>

<p>
 It’s not a controversial statement that Delphi is not what it once was in its heyday [
 <a href="#[OracleAtDelphi05]">
  OracleAtDelphi05
 </a>
 ]. Nevertheless, I think it’s worth reviewing what might have formed part of the secret sauce that was part of its success back then. The current version now supports building 64-bit projects across the 3 main desktop platforms, to select one area of evolution of the product.
</p>

<p>
 Furthermore the original aspects that were key for me are not only still there, but better than before.
</p>

<h3>
 Non goals and own goals
</h3>

<p>
 There are many things I will not be discussing in this article. For example, there is always Much To Discuss when it comes to choice of programming language – I am told – but I will be attempting to steer clear of controversy of that nature.
</p>

<p>
 Comparing laundry lists of features between languages in some kind of checklist knockout tournament is certainly not the aim here.
</p>

<p>
 Instead, I want to recall – or if you will, eulogise – a rich seam of features of the tool that for me made Delphi the game changer that it was then...
</p>

<p>
 Back when I used it full time, these techniques were what made it so productive and what’s more fun to work with, and I humbly submit that there are few tools that come close to touching it even now.
</p>



<h2>
 First, a quick review
</h2>

<p>
 Delphi is a commercial product for developing software [
 <a href="#[Embarcadero-1]">
  Embarcadero-1
 </a>
 ], [
 <a href="#[Wikipedia-1]">
  Wikipedia-1
 </a>
 ], with a proprietary IDE and version of Object Pascal [
 <a href="#[Wikipedia-2]">
  Wikipedia-2
 </a>
 ] that integrates tightly with the solution [
 <a href="#[Embarcadero-3]">
  Embarcadero-3
 </a>
 ]. There is even a free version you can download from [
 <a href="#[Embarcadero-2]">
  Embarcadero-2
 </a>
 ], and if you can puzzle your way past the registration djinns, you can have it installed and up and running in a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
 Table 1 shows a heavily abridged table of releases with my comments for some key milestones.
</p>



<p>
 For prior art: there is even an ACCU article [
 <a href="#[Fagg98]">
  Fagg98
 </a>
 ] article, and if you want a much funnier, arguably less slightly less technical summary of the early days, try this on for size [
 <a href="#[Stob12]">
  Stob12
 </a>
 ].
</p>

<p>
 Here are seven bullet points I’ve chosen to give a flavour of the system:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Fast
  </strong>
  <p>
   Compile times were always in the vanguard, currently there are quotes of many thousands of lines per second.
  </p>
  <p>
   The time from a standing start of just source to a fully linked native executable that was ready to go was also very, very short. In the days of ‘spinning rust’ drives, this is a feature that really mattered – there is a nice little review here [
   <a href="#[Hague09]">
    Hague09
   </a>
   ].
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Strongly typed
  </strong>
  (mainly
  <a href="#FN02">
   <sup>
    2
   </sup>
  </a>
  )
  <p>
   <code>
    for
   </code>
   loops could only be Ordinal types. I got over the shock of not being able to increment a
   <code>
    double
   </code>
   type very quickly and never looked back.
  </p>
  <p>
   You could (and should) declare enums and sub-range types. It would then be a compilation
   <em>
    and runtime
   </em>
   error to assign incorrect values to these types, if you chose to enable the strict compilation mode, which you almost always should.
  </p>
  <pre>    type
    // everyone likes cards
      Suit = (Club, Diamond, Heart, Spade);
    // small things that it's just embarrassing 
    // to get wrong
      SmallNumber = -128..127;
      SomeCaps = 'A'..'Z';
      Month = 0..11;</pre>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Run time type information at all times
  </strong>
  <p>
   One could always identify the type of an object at runtime and it was built into the language – with a little more effort one could browse all the types in the programs’ type system. This will come in useful for building up complex objects, as we will see.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Straightforward dependency management
  </strong>
  <p>
   The language has files called units – basically modules, which supported interface and implementation sections for exported symbols and internal only code.
  </p>
  <p>
   Circular dependencies were a compile time error, it’s worth taking a second to let that sink in.
  </p>
  <p>
   This required the developer to structure their program as a Directed Acyclic Graph, which strongly encouraged a way of organising one’s code in such a way that one really only had to inspect the interface section of a new dependency unit, and then choose whether to make it a dependency in the implementation or not.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rinse and repeat for the rest of the program.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the order of initialisation and finalisation of the units was straightforward and robust (even if spelled incorrectly – see later ☺).
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Extensible RTL and Visual class libraries exploiting the strengths of the language
  </strong>
  <p>
   Object Pascal supports class properties (read/write, write-only, read-only) as a first class feature. Objects on the stack are simply not allowed – I suspect eliminating this capability freed Delphi from having to deal with a large class of issues related to dynamic runtime use of code. Coupled with the ability to use the RTTI, these work together to support configurability of classes from properties.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Source-based component model
  </strong>
  <p>
   It’s worth bearing in mind that the time when Delphi was conceived was the era of the rise of the component-based software model [
   <a href="#[Wikipedia-4]">
    Wikipedia-4
   </a>
   ]. For example, people could pay (remember paying for software?) a nugatory amount for a component that would emulate Excel and embed it into their software.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the very first release of Delphi was a thorough guide to writing components, proselytising for the style of authoring components. This was really high quality work and – true story – we kept a copy of the Delphi 1 guide chapters that didn’t survive to later releases around to consult, as it remained relevant.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   You could go deep if you wanted
  </strong>
  <p>
   For those minded to use them, the features of a language for the ‘hard core programmer’ were also there:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    full access to the FFI of binaries of other languages at link time
   </li>
   <li>
    a range of selectable calling conventions (see [
    <a href="#[Wikipedia-3]">
     Wikipedia-3
    </a>
    ] for details of these)
   </li>
   <li>
    capability to hand-craft dynamic loading of code modules
   </li>
   <li>
    all the usual crazy casting stuff some programmers like to do (rarely needed in Delphi)
   </li>
   <li>
    inline assembly.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>
 Contention: Delphi was inherently very dynamic for its time
</h2>

<p>
 This is my central thesis.
</p>

<p>
 In 1999, I could fire up the IDE, load the source of a visual form connected to, say a database and see and navigate records fetched from the database
 <em>
  live in the designer
 </em>
 . The development environment was quick and effective to work in, and I had access to the source for debugging and simply improving my mind by reading the code.
</p>

<p>
 That feature just on its own, helped to teach me a lot about the engineering of a coherent architecture. And for those prepared to take the time to investigate, it had a cornucopia of treasures to uncover beyond the super user friendly surface.
</p>

<h3>
 Example: how the ability to read and
 <em>
  debug into
 </em>
 the source make a difference
</h3>

<p>
 Figure 1 is a simple UI app I created in a few clicks with no code. Setting one breakpoint and stepping in using one key combination I see where the application launches the main UI form and then enters the main Windows interactive message loop.
</p>



<h3>
 Delphi’s streaming system and form design
</h3>

<p>
 Now the real killer app for the app development was the fully synchronised visual designer
</p>

<p>
 Let’s have a look at some actual code to plug together some hypothetical framework objects. Note, this process relies upon the concepts of
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  properties
 </li>
 <li>
  the Delphi closure type (reference to method call on object instance)
 </li>
 <li>
  and RTTI to allow the RTL to work all the magic of wiring up the properties
 </li>
 <li>
  there is also a hint of a framework which defines the ownership from the line
  <code>
   TfrmClock.Create(Application);
  </code>
  <pre>      begin
        frmClock := TfrmClock.Create(Application);
        lblTime := TLabel.Create(frmClock)
        lblTime.Caption := '...'
        tmrTick := TTimer.Create(frmClock);
        tmrTick.onTimer = tmrTickTimer;
        frmClock.AddChild(tmrTick);
        // ...
      end;  </pre>
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
 And let’s have a look at some hypothetical DSL code to describe the moral equivalent of that code
</p>

<pre>  object frmClock: TfrmClock
    Caption = 'Clock'
    object lblTime: TLabel
      Caption = '...'
    end
    object tmrTick: TTimer
      OnTimer = tmrTickTimer
    end
  end</pre>

<p>
 Full disclosure: Of course it’s actual real DSL (edited slightly for space)!
 <em>
  The IDE would generate all of that for you.
 </em>
</p>

<p>
 Now, with the mere addition of the following line to a class method called
 <code>
  tmrTickTimer
 </code>
 … we have a clock app!
</p>

<p>
 <img alt="The clock app." src="https://accu.org/journals/overload/27/153/martin_2703/1.png">
</p>

<pre>   lblTime.Caption := TimeToStr(Now);</pre>

<p>
 So, that’s assembling visual components visually sorted then.
</p>

<h3>
 Registry singletons done right (TM)
</h3>

<p>
 Listings 1–4 are an example illustrating how deterministic initialisation of modules would allow for very simple, yet very robust registration concepts, giving the following output:
</p>

<pre>  Registry Adding: TSomeProcessor
  Registry Adding: TAnotherProcessor
  Program starting
  Registration complete
  Program exiting
  Registry Removing: TAnotherProcessor
  Registry Removing: TSomeProcessor</pre>

<p>
 Note the initialisation follows the lexical ordering in the program unit
 <em>
  in this case
 </em>
 (but see later), and also that the de-init occurs perfectly in the inverse order.
</p>









<p>
 Add this
 <code>
  uses
 </code>
 directive into
 <code>
  SomeProcessor
 </code>
 , adding a source level dependency to
 <code>
  AnotherProcessor
 </code>
 from the
 <code>
  SomeProcessor
 </code>
 <em>
  implementation
 </em>
 (Listing 5).
</p>



<p>
 The output is:
</p>

<pre>  Registry Adding: TAnotherProcessor
  Registry Adding: TSomeProcessor
  Program starting
  Registration complete
  Program exiting
  Registry Removing: TSomeProcessor
  Registry Removing: TAnotherProcessor</pre>

<p>
 Note this happens when updating the implementation of single unit, not the program code, which remains blissfully agnostic of the changes. In this way we have been able to clearly and unambiguously capture a program dependency that was previously not knowable from inspecting the source.
</p>

<h3>
 There are corollaries
</h3>

<ul>
 <li>
  RAII
  <em>
   per se
  </em>
  is out, although your classes must of course still behave sensibly
  <ul>
   <li>
    this may have been noticed – properties need to have workable defaults (or default behaviour that makes sense)
   </li>
   <li>
    once you have committed to a property based system for configuring objects, what constructors could you possibly write? Instead of solving that hard problem, the component is plugged into the framework
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  no automatic destruction of class instances
  <ul>
   <li>
    destruction is explicit in Delphi’s Object Pascal and – key point – with the Delphi component framework the object deletion would be handled for you correctly
   </li>
   <li>
    coupled with the streaming system’s ability to ‘automagically’ find and instantiate the right classes when streaming in a definition, you spend a lot less time worrying about ‘ownership’ – because (a) it’s done for you, and (b) if you wanted to do it yourself, you may well get it wrong or find yourself fighting the existing framework every step of the way
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  classes are exclusively references types – so no objects on the stack, à la c++
  <ul>
   <li>
    this may feel like an intolerable constraint, but it happens to fits in well with the concept of dynamic extensibility -&gt;
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The code to construct an object can be supplied, even updated on the fly, because
   <em>
    all objects are the same size
   </em>
   – they are the size of a pointer!
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    delivering essentially, a ‘plugin’ system that is capable of plugging in classes and their type metadata
    <em>
     on the fly
    </em>
   </li>
   <li>
    by the way: the IDE does this every time you rebuild a component package you are working on in the IDE
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  Exceptions can only throw objects, and also, given the singly rooted hierarchy we can always walk our way to the actual instance type if you have imported its interface
  <ul>
   <li>
    conveniently an extensible object designer system can simply roll back the stack from the offending starting point
   </li>
   <li>
    <em>
     what is more
    </em>
    if the function was a property setter invoked by the IDE, then the IDE system can simply reject arbitrary failed attempts to set a property
    <em>
     without additional a priori knowledge of the internals of the components that are interacting
    </em>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>

<h3>
 Example of design-time and run-time exception handling
</h3>

<p>
 So, let’s see an example of the exception handling strategy in action. Here is the behaviour when I attempt an operation in the IDE that cannot be fulfilled (Figure 2) and how that component raised it in the code (Figure 3). Note that the same code is run in the IDE, via the component package which can be plugged in via the IDE’s extensibility.
</p>





<p>
 In order to investigate this I only had to add this code and hit ‘Debug’ – hence seeing the code by debugging the application, which will generate the same exception.
</p>

<pre>  procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
  begin
    SQLConnection1.Open;
  end;</pre>

<p>
 In the IDE, the property set on the object fails, and the user is notified.
</p>

<p>
 In the application, the default exception handler installed for the application is invoked, as I elected to not install my own handler, or write an exception handling block.
</p>

<p>
 That’s the power of a unified and usable approach to exception handling. Figure 4 shows how it looks in the app.
</p>



<h2>
 C’mon it can’t have been that perfect, can it?
</h2>

<p>
 Now I have to explain why Delphi is not enjoying the popularity it once did.
</p>

<h3>
 Web applications
</h3>

<p>
 Delphi was great for software that would be popped into the post, on a CD or floppy disks.
</p>

<p>
 When the web based application revolution came, that became irrelevant for many new applications. I feel the offerings within the Delphi toolbox for web development didn’t seem to cut through on the feature set, and of course at the time, everything from the OS to the Development tool needed to be paid for.
</p>

<p>
 Given the competition at the time was the LAMP stack Linux + Apache + MySql + PHP, it was clear how that would play out.
</p>

<h3>
 It was proprietary
</h3>

<p>
 So, a fact of life is: individual companies get in trouble, go off-beam etc. this can be a real concern. For example the 64-bit compiler took a long time to appear, and some companies like to take a very long view on their enterprise applications.
</p>

<h3>
 Cost concerns
</h3>

<p>
 It could end up looking pricey compared to free tools. Yet: ‘beware false economies’.
</p>

<h3>
 Quality issues
</h3>

<p>
 There were some releases that had surprisingly persistent niggles: the debugger in Delphi 4 could be a real pain, especially given the Delphi 3 debugger was an absolute pleasure to work with. This is the kind of thing that worries thoughtful programmers and managers with an eye to the future.
</p>

<p>
 Another syndrome that I saw which was very sad, is that the marvellous extensible IDE was at risk from poorly programmed component packages. The IDE would be blamed for instability, when in fact, the code that it loaded into its core might well be the cause. With an improved architecture, that might have been mitigated, but perhaps not eliminated.
</p>

<p>
 And finally: of course, native code is not to be 100% trusted, yet can only be run as 100% trusted.
</p>

<h3>
 Interfacing with code from other systems
</h3>

<p>
 Some might believe this was not possible, but in fact it was.
</p>

<p>
 Of course the interaction with the Windows libraries was mainly via the win32 API, proving the point.
</p>

<p>
 So, there was nothing preventing the user from making their own integrations, however these did require some expertise and effort to produce the translation units that could make use of the foreign function interfaces.
</p>

<p>
 In fact, one of the long standing issues with Delphi for some people was that the translation units would not be updated quickly enough when new systems or features arrived in Windows. This resulted in the Delphi programmers either having to roll their own or wait for new Delphi releases.
</p>

<h2>
 In retrospect
</h2>

<p>
 So, in 2019, what conclusions can we draw?
</p>

<h3>
 Rapid Application Development with true visual design
</h3>

<p>
 Properties, Methods and Events allow complex UI to be defined in a very minimalist fashion, which is A Good Thing. There are many camps on this topic, but I hope I demonstrated above, the system supported fully visual development, all the way from specified in the designer to fully defined in code and all the waypoints between, and what is more: cleanly.
</p>

<p>
 That was a strength – not all apps need to be coded the same way, or need the same level of complexity.
</p>

<h3>
 Strong typing can actually be fine for RAD
</h3>

<p>
 Caveat: with the right level of compiler and runtime co-operation.
</p>

<p>
 Personally, I enjoyed debugging in Delphi, as it seemed that faults tended to be more reproducible and more easily reasoned through that some other languages.
</p>

<h3>
 Modules are awesome
</h3>

<p>
 When the programmer needs to employ a unit from another unit, they really only need to choose whether they want to add it to the interface or not – and there is a habit forming effect from the constant gentle reminder that it was preferable to factor your code well such that dependencies could be added in the implementation.
</p>

<p>
 In some cases one could simply add a reference to a different module to a code file in order to modify/patch the programs’ behaviour – see prior example.
</p>

<h3>
 How many of these concerns sound familiar even today?
</h3>

<p>
 I suspect we can learn much from the design precepts of the previous glory days of Delphi and take some lessons forward for the next iteration of our tools. The observant reader will spot that I mention both compile time and run-time behaviour of a feature quite often. This is uppermost in my mind because although a hypothetical rapid development environment may have well tuned strictness and guarantees in the compiler or in the serialisation system, the true art is ensuring that there is the minimum ‘impedance mismatch’ between those two concepts.
</p>

<p>
 There is little point in polishing those systems if I then end up spending my time fighting the edge cases when they interact. Typically that borderland is where the tool support is weakest, and also, it tends to be the most user visible portion of applications. My contention is that in making that area just easier to operate in, Delphi allowed developers to focus on the parts of application development that added the most value to the user.

And I naturally stuttered through a canned answer about how they use arbitrage opportunities in the market to profit off of mis-priced securities, etc. Then he asked me, "but what benefit do we provide? Why is working here good for society?"</p><p>I blanked, and didn't answer for about 15 seconds. Then, I tried to start piecing together an answer until he stopped me, told me he had found my Facebook, and wasn't appreciative of my politics (I was moderately lefty in high school, significantly more so now; maybe this conversation is part of why). He had _printouts_ of some posts I had made criticizing George W. Bush, talking about why I thought we should be raising taxes on higher earners, supporting Obamacare, etc. He told me that he didn't think I had the "cojones to stomach the job" (direct quote), and told the recruiter not to bother with the last interview and that I had failed.</p><p>I _sobbed_ on the train home; I think it was the worst I had ever felt about an interview in my entire life, and yet looking back at it, I think this was the best possible outcome. Imagine if I had worked for this asshole.</p><p>I've worked for companies I don't personally agree with in the past; it's part of living in a society(TM). I am able to hold my nose to a certain extent to make an income for my family (heck, I am currently having to cross picket lines to come to work, which makes me feel icky). But I can't fathom what hell I would have been living under had I gotten and taken that job.

I had a hard stop to get to JFK, so I was getting anxious and ready to walk.  He finally comes gets me.  The place is tiny and everyone is squeezed into two large tables, one being a large round dining room table.  No one made a sound, and it seemed like a sweatshop.</p><p>Not kidding, we maybe spent about ten minutes talking about my experience, and he took the remaining 20-30 minutes talking about how he was likely going to leave soon to do a Masters in PolySci.

I withdrew the next day when I got back home.</p><p>They sold to a major newspaper about 8 months later.  Not sure what the terms were or if it would have been a quick payout for me, but my gut says that would have been a miserable 8 months.  The job I took instead turned out to be four years at a great company.  It ultimately failed, but I was managed by a sharp boss who I greatly respected, and colleagues who many ended up being great friends.

                  <p><span>To me the aptitude tests are red flags.
Once had a successfull technical round plus agreement on work conditions and compensation when the last step was completing an aptitude test. Two parts (had a chance for a single practice round). One was finance related calculations (this was a developer job for a CAD application) mixed with logic and pattern completion tests, with less than adequate time to complete - yet both progress and accuracy was judged without specifics how. The second part was 'which one do you find more important' kind of personality test with all important answers of independent matters (all three are important in their own place), all without a context that would require different choices, expecting universal answers, and again, not enough time but rushing through without deliberation or contemplation of the right answer.
I was asking how will they use the results and they said something like 'to determine abilities, suitability for advancements and future roles in the company'. All after position related technical interviews succeeded.
I chose not to be judged this way now and in the future, in case they take it dead seriously. If not, then opt out because of that, being unnecessary.
Since they told it is mandatory and everyone (10k+ employee) have to be judged the very same way and repeatedly throughout the course of employment with bleeding heart (interesting task, same wavelength with technical manager, remote work in 2019, good enogh salary, being without income for 3 months already) I said no (after rounds of emails with HR trying to negotiate this away).
I am afraid of an organization with this level of robotic stubbornness about vaguely relevant attempt of measuring a persons whole personality and future at the company in 30 minute automated tests with unveryfiable methodology.</span></p></div></td></tr>

<p>Deploying apps for the Linux desktop is hard. A major problem has historically been library compatibility. Different Linux distributions, and even different versions of the same distribution, have had incompatible libraries. Unfortunately, there hasn’t always been a culture of backwards compatibility on the Linux desktop.</p>
<p>This is finally changing. The stability of the Linux desktop has dramatically improved in recent years. Core library developers are finally seeing the benefits of maintaining compatibility. Despite this, many developers are not interested in depending on a stable base of libraries for binary software. Instead, they have decided to ignore and override almost all libraries pre-installed on the user’s system.</p>
<p>The current solutions involve packaging entire alternate runtimes in containerized environments. <a href="https://www.flatpak.org/">Flatpak</a>, <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">Snap</a>, <a href="https://appimage.org/">AppImage</a>, <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>: these all provide an app packaging mechanism that replaces most or all of the system’s runtime libraries, and they now all use containerization to accomplish this.</p>
<p>Flatpak calls itself “the future of application distribution”. I am not a fan. I’m going to outline here some of the technical, security and usability problems with Flatpak and others. I’ll try to avoid addressing “fixable” problems (like theming) and instead focus on fundamental problems inherent in their design. I aim to convince you that these are not the future of desktop Linux apps.</p>
<h2 id="size">Size</h2>
<p>Suppose you want to make a simple calculator app. How big should the download be?</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, the latest <a href="https://appimage.github.io/KCalc/">KCalc AppImage</a> (if you can even figure out <a href="https://github.com/AppImage/appimage.github.io/blob/master/data/KCalc">how to download it</a>) is 152 MB. For a <em>calculator</em>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://ludocode.com/assets/blog/flatpak-kcalc.png" alt="A screenshot of KCalc, a calculator app.">
</figure>
<p>This is uncompetitive with Windows on its face. If I ship an app for Windows I don’t have to include the entire Win32 or .NET runtimes with my app. I just use what’s already on the user’s system.</p>
<p>Other solutions like Flatpak or Steam download the runtime separately. Your app metadata specifies what runtime it wants to use and a service downloads it and runs your app against it.</p>
<p>So how big are these runtimes? On a fresh machine, install <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.kde.kcalc">KCalc from Flathub</a>. You’re looking at a nearly 900 MB download to get your first runtime. <em>For a calculator</em>.</p>
<pre><code>        ID                                      Branch    Op   Remote    Download
 1.     org.freedesktop.Platform.GL.default     20.08     i    flathub   &lt; 106.4&nbsp;MB
 2.     org.freedesktop.Platform.VAAPI.Intel    20.08     i    flathub    &lt; 11.6&nbsp;MB
 3.     org.freedesktop.Platform.openh264       2.0       i    flathub     &lt; 1.5&nbsp;MB
 4.     org.kde.KStyle.Adwaita                  5.15      i    flathub     &lt; 6.6&nbsp;MB
 5.     org.kde.Platform.Locale                 5.15      i    flathub   &lt; 341.4&nbsp;MB (partial)
 6.     org.kde.Platform                        5.15      i    flathub   &lt; 370.1&nbsp;MB
 7.     org.kde.kcalc.Locale                    stable    i    flathub   &lt; 423.1&nbsp;kB (partial)
 8.     org.kde.kcalc                           stable    i    flathub     &lt; 4.4&nbsp;MB</code></pre>
<p>Note that the app package itself is only 4.4 MB. The rest is all redundant libraries that are already on my system. I just ran the <code>kcalc</code> binary straight out of its Flatpak install path unsandboxed and let it use my native libraries. It ran just fine, because all of the libraries it uses are backwards compatible.</p>
<p>Flatpak wants to download 3D drivers, patented video codecs, themes, locales, Qt 5, KDE 5, GTK 3, ICU, LLVM, ffmpeg, Python, and everything else in <code>org.kde.Platform</code>, all to run a calculator. Because unlike AppImage, the runtime isn’t stripped down to just what the app needs. It’s got every dependency for any app. It’s an entire general-purpose OS on top of your existing OS.</p>
<h4 id="sharing-runtimes">Sharing Runtimes?</h4>
<p>Flatpak says this is so that apps can share runtimes. But the whole point of their runtime system is to let apps use different runtimes. Each branch of a runtime (representing, say, a different base version of Ubuntu) is a completely independent runtime image.</p>
<p>They claim that they deduplicate runtimes. I question how much can really be shared between different branches when everything is recompiled. How much has <code>/usr</code> changed between releases of Ubuntu? I would guess just about all of it.</p>
<p>Steam at least fares somewhat better. The Soldier runtime is a 610 MB download, still large. But Steam only publishes a couple of official runtimes, so most games do actually share runtimes.</p>
<p>Flatpak allows anyone to define their own runtimes. <a href="https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/available-runtimes.html">freedesktop.org publishes some Flatpak runtimes</a> for common use, but these aren’t necessarily the ones apps are using. For example Fedora publishes apps with its own runtimes, and these are the ones available by default in its Software store.</p>
<p>If you install GIMP in Fedora 34’s Software store, it defaults to Fedora’s Flatpak of GIMP. This pulls in Fedora 35’s 650 MB runtime, not any freedesktop.org runtime. Nothing will be shared with our freedesktop runtime KCalc we installed from Flathub earlier. On my machine <code>/var/lib/flatpak</code> is using over 3 GB of disk space for just these two apps.</p>
<p>This is apparently working as intended. They want runtimes to be a free-for-all, filling your hard drive with gigabytes of custom junk for every app. I can’t imagine what system updates will be like in the future when you have a few dozen apps storing tens of gigabytes of runtimes that all want to be kept up to date.</p>
<h4 id="disk-space-is-cheap">“Disk space is cheap!”</h4>
<p>They say disk space is cheap. This is not true, not for the root devices of modern computers. Built-in storage has in fact been shrinking.</p>
<p>Software has gotten so much slower and more bloated that operating systems no longer run acceptably on spinning rust. Laptop manufacturers are switching to smaller flash drives to improve performance while preserving margins. Budget laptops circa 2015 shipped with 256 GB or larger mechanical drives. Now in 2021 they ship with 120 GB flash. NVMe drives are around $100/TB and laptop manufacturers inflate these prices 500% or more so upgrading a new laptop can be pricey.</p>
<p>Chromebooks are even smaller as they push everything onto cloud storage. Smartphones are starting to run full-fledged Linux distributions. The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 4</a> and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400/">400</a> use an SD card as root device and have such fantastic performance that we’re on the verge of a revolution in low-cost computing. Surely Flatpak should be usable on these systems! There is no reason why a 16 GB root device shouldn’t fit every possible piece of non-game software we could want. Flatpak isn’t part of the revolution; it’s holding it back.</p>
<p>Why shouldn’t storage shrink anyway? <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/">Software should be getting more efficient, not less.</a> Even if bandwidth were free and hard drives grew on trees, it would not excuse such drastic bloat. The waste involved in these app packaging solutions is downright offensive. Apollo landed on the moon with 4 kB of RAM and 72 kB of ROM, yet we can’t run a calculator with less than 150 MB. Any engineer worth his salt should be optimizing for efficiency, not dismissing it as irrelevant, especially when it so clearly impacts the user experience.</p>
<h4 id="memory-usage-startup-time">Memory Usage, Startup Time</h4>
<p>The penalties of huge alternate runtimes aren’t just in storage and bandwidth.</p>
<p>Each app with a new runtime adds another hundred megs or more of RAM usage. This adds up fast. Most computers don’t have enough RAM to run all their apps with alternate runtimes. The Raspberry Pi 400 has only 4 GB of RAM. Low-end Chromebooks have only 2 GB. Budget laptops tend to have 8 GB, mostly thanks to the bloat of Windows 10, but these app packaging solutions are catching up to it.</p>
<p>A bigger problem is that these apps can actually take several seconds to start up. They have to load all their own libraries from disk instead of using what’s already on the system, already in memory.</p>
<p>Snap is the slowest of all, largely because it stores all its data in squashfs images. Snap mounts all registered snaps at startup instead of just extracting the metadata they need beforehand, possibly in an effort to mitigate this slowness. They’re just moving part of the slow startup time to the boot time of your computer. All sorts of snap crap now shows up in <code>mount</code> and <code>fdisk -l</code>. The more snaps you have installed, the slower your computer will start, even if you don’t use them.</p>
<p>Today, on my machine, the KCalc Snap takes a full seven seconds to start up. Not just the first time after boot; every time, without fail. Seven seconds to start a calculator.</p>
<p>Canonical started converting their basic desktop apps like the GNOME Calculator to Snap in Ubuntu 18.04. The user experience was so terrible that they <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/fa8ewy/ubuntu_2004_lts_to_revert_gnome_calculator_and/">quietly converted them back to normal apps</a> in Ubuntu 20.04. If these technologies are not even good enough for their own apps, those as basic as a calculator, why would they be good enough for yours?</p>
<h2 id="drivers">Drivers</h2>
<p>A major problem with alternate runtimes is drivers. New graphics hardware needs new graphics libraries which have a ton of dependencies. Mesa depends on LLVM for compiling shaders. The NVidia driver depends on a kernel module whose version must exactly match that of the library. All of these libraries have their own transitive dependencies like libdrm, libstdc++ and glibc. If you want new hardware to work, you need to be using new versions of all of these libraries.</p>
<p>Linux distributions, especially those with rolling releases or <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Ubuntu-20.04.3-LTS-Coming">hardware enablement packages</a>, do a great job of keeping these libraries up-to-date for new hardware. Bundled runtimes do not.</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbWbBYAolo&amp;t=111s">the pain Steam has to go through to get drivers working</a> in the Steam Runtime. They use various heuristics to determine whether to override each library in the runtime with that of the host system, so each app is running on a Frankenstein hodge-podge of libraries. This is not the way to build stable software.</p>
<p>Flatpak recognizes that mixing libraries with the host system is a mess. Instead, they want to bundle their own graphics drivers in the runtimes, keeping them regularly updated for new hardware. But they can’t control the most important part, the kernel, so they can’t directly package drivers that depend on specific kernel versions or proprietary kernel modules. So the runtime is broken into <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2015/09/23/playing-games-with-runtime-extensions/">extensions</a>, and extensions can go the Steam route of pulling in the native driver or even download specific NVidia drivers on-the-fly to match the kernel module.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/AppImage/pkg2appimage/blob/master/excludelist">AppImage mixes host libraries with the runtime as well</a>, but not dynamically; they just decide what to exclude at packaging time so it’s even less reliable than Steam. <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/overview.html">Docker has an NVidia toolkit</a> that must be installed on both the host system and the containerized runtime to get drivers working. <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/the-graphics-core20-snap-interface/23000">Snap is doing who knows what.</a> None of these are proper solutions.</p>
<p>Drivers are supposed to be the responsibility of the operating system. This is what it’s good at. Why are we working so hard to get around what the operating system offers by default for native apps?</p>
<p>This isn’t an issue specific to video games by the way. Lots of modern apps are now directly using hardware accelerated graphics, even <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty#readme">terminals</a> and <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/hardware-accelerated-rendering">text editors</a>. Many apps need the GPU for background computation. Productivity apps like video editors, apps that use machine learning, scientific tools like space/astronomy visualization, anything that does 3D like Google Earth… All of these need access to modern video hardware. This will only grow as apps get faster and provide more features and richer user interfaces.</p>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>Flatpak allows apps to declare that they need full access to your filesystem or your home folder, yet graphical software stores still claim such apps are sandboxed. This has been <a href="https://flatkill.org/2020/">discussed before</a>. Here’s what happens when I search GIMP in the Software app on a fresh install of Fedora 34:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://ludocode.com/assets/blog/flatpak-gimp-sandboxed.png" alt="Fedora claims GIMP is sandboxed. If you click “High” next to “Permissions”, you see a little exclamation mark saying it has “File system” permissions.">
</figure>
<p>Such an app can drop a malware executable anywhere in your home folder and add a line to your <code>~/.profile</code> or a desktop entry to <code>~/.config/autostart/</code> to have it auto-started on your next login. Not only will it run outside of any container, it will even persist after the app is uninstalled.</p>
<p>This is exactly what a nefarious app would do to break out of its sandbox. This is also what a virus would do that exploited a security vulnerability in a sandboxed app.</p>
<p>Suppose libjpeg has a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability. You open a seemingly innocuous JPEG in Flatpak GIMP and it drops its payload set to autostart in your home folder. How did the sandbox help here? The behaviour of this virus is identical regardless of whether GIMP is sandboxed. The only differences are that a) the libjpeg in the alternate runtime is likely to stay out-of-date longer than the one from your Linux distribution; and b) the virus is more likely to work against the sandboxed app because all installations will be using the exact same binary of libjpeg.</p>
<p>The Snap Store app, to its credit, displays a warning: “This application is unconfined. It can access all personal files and system resources.” Which apps display this warning, you ask? All of them. KCalc has it. All of the Editor’s Picks have it. In my testing for this blog post I could not find an app that does not display the warning.</p>
<h4 id="its-better-than-nothing">“It’s better than nothing!”</h4>
<p>Flatpak and Snap apologists claim that some security is better than nothing. This is not true. From a purely technical perspective, for apps with filesystem access the security is exactly equal to nothing. In reality it’s actually worse than nothing because it leads people to place more trust than they should in random apps they find on the internet.</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-i-have-a-problem-with-appimages-on-linux/">this writer</a> complaining about the security of AppImages while praising Flatpak and Snap:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I install applications via source, apt, Snap and Flatpak–I don’t discriminate. As long as an application will install and run as expected, I’ll install it, regardless of the package format.</p>
<p>With one exception: AppImages.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>On the rare occasion I’m willing to use an AppImage, I will only do so when I absolutely trust the developer. Why? Remember, an AppImage is an application you simply download and run. Anyone can build an AppImage, proclaim it a must-have piece of software, roll something nefarious into it, and make it available for download.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He expresses deep skepticism of AppImages, but not of Flatpaks or Snaps, because he believes their security measures keep him safe. This is the danger of lying about sandboxing.</p>
<h4 id="permissions-and-portals">Permissions and Portals</h4>
<p>Flatpak is working on a <a href="https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/sandbox-permissions.html">fine-grained permission system</a> to improve the security of its sandbox. Permissions are things like whether the app is allowed to access the microphone or the printer. Portals are things like a file open dialog that runs outside the sandbox, so the app in the sandbox gets only the file the user chose.</p>
<p>Flatpak documents these portals and provides <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/libportal">libportal</a>, a client library to access them. However this isn’t really intended for individual apps. It’s all meant to be integrated in the toolkits. From the <a href="https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/sandbox-permissions.html#portals">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interface toolkits like GTK3 and Qt5 implement transparent support for portals, meaning that applications don’t need to do any additional work to use them (it is worth checking which portals each toolkit supports).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently, developing client APIs for apps themselves is antithetical to Flatpak’s mission. They want the apps running on Flatpak to be unaware of Flatpak. They would rather modify the core libraries like GTK to integrate with Flatpak. So for example if you want to open a file, you don’t call a Flatpak API function to get a file or request permissions. Instead, you call for an ordinary GTK file open dialog and your Flatpak runtime’s GTK internally does the portal interaction with the Flatpak service (using all sorts of hacks to let you access the file “normally” and pretend you’re not sandboxed.)</p>
<p>This is the most complicated and brittle way to implement this. It’s also not at all how other sandboxed platforms work. If I want file access permissions on Android, I don’t just try to open a file with the Java File API and expect it to magically prompt the user. I have to call <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting">Android-specific APIs to request permissions first</a>. iOS is the same. So why shouldn’t I be able to just call <code>flatpak_request_permission(PERMISSION)</code> and get a callback when the user approves or declines?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faqQuJkqCIA&amp;t=1347s">This is why.</a> Fedora is auto-converting all of their rpm apps to Flatpak. In order for this to work, they need the Flatpak permission system and Flatpak in general to require no app changes whatsoever.</p>
<p>Why on Earth would they do a mass automatic conversion of apps? Your guess is as good as mine. The video claims that Fedora’s apps are higher quality than upstream, and Fedora makes their Flatpaks available on older distributions. I think it’s more likely they just want huge numbers of auto-converted apps to make it look like Flatpak is useful. Whatever the reason, it’s clear that this requirement has influenced many of their poor design decisions.</p>
<h4 id="identifier-clashes">Identifier Clashes</h4>
<p>So Fedora auto-converts all its apps to Flatpak. Does it at least namespace them to something specific to Fedora?</p>
<p>No, it doesn’t. Fedora publishes its Flatpak of GIMP as <code>org.gimp.GIMP</code>. This conflicts with the official <code>org.gimp.GIMP</code> published by the GIMP developers on Flathub. On a fresh install of Fedora 34, if you add the Flathub repository and type <code>flatpak install org.gimp.GIMP</code>, you get prompted for which one to install:</p>
<pre><code>[nick@fedora active]$ flatpak install org.gimp.GIMP
Looking for matches…
Remotes found with refs similar to ‘org.gimp.GIMP’:

   1) ‘fedora’ (system)
   2) ‘flathub’ (system)

Which do you want to use (0 to abort)? [0-2]:</code></pre>
<p>If you choose option 1, you get a build of GIMP with Fedora’s patches that uses the 650 MB Fedora 35 runtime. If you choose option 2, you get a different build of GIMP that uses the 1.8 GB freedesktop.org GNOME runtime.</p>
<p>Isn’t the whole point of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation">reverse DNS</a> that the <code>org.gimp</code> prefix is reserved for people who actually own the <code>gimp.org</code> domain? How can Fedora justify publishing apps while masquerading as the upstream developers? If major Linux distributions won’t even respect DNS, who will?</p>
<p>Flathub doesn’t enforce DNS ownership either by the way. They let anyone publish anything; they merely <a href="https://github.com/flathub/flathub/wiki/App-Submission#someone-else-has-put-my-app-on-flathubwhat-do-i-do">prefer</a> that apps are controlled by their authors. A sane security strategy would be to require a DNS challenge to allow a publisher to use a specific app prefix.</p>
<h2 id="complexity">Complexity</h2>
<p>Endless articles have been written about the importance of simplicity in software design. <a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html">Worse is Better</a> is perhaps the earliest example. A modern refrain is “<a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3639050/complexity-is-killing-software-developers.html">software complexity is killing us</a>”. The state of software development is downright miserable in 2021.</p>
<p>You would think that these packaging mechanisms would embrace simplicity if they want to attract software developers. In fact they are doing the opposite. The driver, sandboxing, and permission/portal issues we’ve discussed barely scratch the surface of the complexity involved in making this all work. In “worse is better” terms, they’re not even “the right thing” anymore. At this point they’re just pushing complexity for its own sake.</p>
<p>Proponents of containerization believe it is the solution to every problem, the hammer for every nail. We now have multiple Linux distributions based on containerizing everything (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://getfedora.org/coreos">Fedora CoreOS</a>, <a href="https://www.mocaccino.org/">MocaccinoOS</a>.) We have a major movement to adopt Docker and Snap on embedded (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.balena.io/os/">balenaOS</a>, <a href="https://ubuntu.com/core">Ubuntu Core</a>.) Docker may soon be running on your fridge and in your car.</p>
<p>Keep watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbWbBYAolo&amp;t=760s">the video linked earlier</a> to see the descent into madness: Steam nested in a Flatpak; the Scout runtime nested in the Soldier runtime pulling in drivers from the Freedesktop runtime; Steam making IPC calls to its Flatpak container to make parallel containers with yet more runtimes.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://ludocode.com/assets/blog/flatpak-and-steam.jpg" alt="Various combinations of Steam and Flatpak containers and runtimes. Not pictured: Steam and the game running directly on the user’s native environment, like they do on every other OS.">
</figure>
<p>The complexity gets far worse than the above video even shows. Flatpak uses <a href="https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/">libostree</a> to store all its data in a content-addressible deduplicated layer above the filesystem. Steam now uses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Koy71b_AjmU">libcapsule</a> which uses <code>dlmopen()</code> namespaces so that game executables and driver libraries can load different versions of libstdc++ into the same process. We haven’t even talked about Wine/Proton which is a whole other layer of crazyness.</p>
<p>This is a vivid example of software complexity taking us to the brink of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko">collapse</a>. This is the most complicated way imaginable to distribute software. What will happen when large numbers of apps have been shipped that depend on this scaffolding? How will this ever be maintained? How many people on Earth will truly understand how this all works?</p>
<h2 id="services">Services</h2>
<p>All of these app packaging systems require that the user have some service installed on their PC before any packages can be installed.</p>
<p>AppImage, to its credit, technically does not require a service to run apps, but it <a href="https://docs.appimage.org/user-guide/run-appimages.html#integrating-appimages-into-the-desktop">doesn’t integrate with the desktop without it</a>. I needed to use an AppImage app for a while and my solution was to just leave it in my <code>~/Downloads</code> folder and double click it from my file manager to run it. This is a terrible user experience.</p>
<p>All of the desktop integration (launcher entries, mimetypes, icons, updates) is provided by either <code>appimaged</code> or AppImageLauncher, one of which must be installed by the user for any of this to work. So in practice, AppImage is no different than any of our other solutions: it requires a service to be usable.</p>
<p>If a user doesn’t have the service, well that’s another hoop they have to jump through to install an app. A few distributions, notably Fedora, pre-install Flatpak. A few distributions, notably Ubuntu, pre-install Snap. SteamOS pre-installs Steam. Other than these special cases, users have to install the correct service before installing an app. Developers have to teach them to do so and lose all of the users who can’t figure it out or can’t be bothered.</p>
<h4 id="app-stores">App Stores</h4>
<p>A major goal of most of these technologies is to support an “app store” experience: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>, <a href="https://flathub.org/home">Flathub</a>, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam Store</a>, <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">Snapcraft</a>, and <a href="https://appimage.github.io/">AppImageHub</a> (but not <a href="https://www.appimagehub.com/">AppImageHub</a>?) These technologies are all designed around this model because the owners want a cut of sales revenue or fees for enterprise distribution. (Flathub only says they don’t process payments <a href="https://github.com/flathub/flathub/wiki/App-Submission"><em>at present</em></a>. It’s coming.)</p>
<p>This is the real reason Ubuntu wants everyone to use Snap instead of helping us build apps that run natively on Ubuntu. This is also why they keep the Snap server source code closed. They want it to be “open” the way Android is “open”, where there is only one official store and sideloading apps is as annoying as possible.</p>
<p>This is very far from the traditional Windows experience of just downloading an installer, clicking Next a few times, and having your app installed with complete desktop integration. This is true freedom. There are no requirements, no other steps, no hoops to jump through to install an app. This is why the Windows Store and to some extent even the macOS App Store are failing. They can’t compete with the freedom their own platforms provide.</p>
<p>I know free software and privacy people don’t want to allow proprietary apps this level of freedom on their PCs. But the vast majority of users and independent software vendors don’t care. What users want is easy (and efficient!) installation. What the biggest software vendors want is the freedom to ship software directly to customers, without the intervention of a service or hub.</p>
<p>This is indeed possible on the Linux desktop. Let’s talk about that in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-state-of-backwards-compatibility">The Current State of Backwards Compatibility</h2>
<p>There seems to be a collective trauma in the Linux community in depending on libraries to remain binary compatible across distributions and version upgrades. These alternate runtime tools are clearly built by people who refuse to consider using <em>anything</em> on the user’s system (in the case of Flatpak, not even driver libraries.) It’s true that in the past, open source library ABIs were flaky. I’m here to tell you that you no longer have to be afraid.</p>
<p>The backwards compatibility situation has gotten much better in recent years. The Linux kernel has been slowly exporting its legendary culture of backwards compatibility up the stack. Core libraries like glibc (since 2.1) and libstdc++ (since GCC 5) are intending to remain backwards compatible indefinitely. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedesktop.org">freedesktop.org</a> has made huge progress standardizing runtime environments across distributions. Debian and others have mostly stopped making ABI-breaking customizations to their packages. Websites like <a href="https://abi-laboratory.pro/">ABI Laboratory</a> track ABI changes to provide early warnings of breaks. The Linux Standard Base (LSB), though now seemingly defunct, made significant progress in standardizing capabilities and preventing ABI breakage.</p>
<p>Just in the past week, I’ve used several Linux apps distributed as plain binary tarballs that run on my native environment. The generic Linux binary releases of <a href="https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX">DevilutionX</a> and <a href="https://cdn.openttd.org/openttd-releases/12.1/openttd-12.1-linux-generic-amd64.tar.xz">OpenTTD</a> use my native SDL for graphics, sound and input. <a href="https://code-industry.net/masterpdfeditor/">Master PDF Editor</a> uses a long list of native libraries including Qt 5. The <a href="https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/embedded-software/qnx-software-development-platform">QNX Software Center</a> was compiled for the LSB and uses my native GTK 3. These run perfectly, no alternate runtime needed. Why? Because most libraries today are actually decently backwards compatible.</p>
<p><a href="https://gog.com/">GOG.com</a>’s strategy for Linux support is just about the opposite of Steam’s, and works just like traditional installers for Windows. Each game is built for a particular Ubuntu LTS release: 14.04, 16.04, 18.04. As long as your libraries are at least that new, the game will run. They ship self-extracting install wizards built with <a href="https://icculus.org/mojosetup/">mojosetup</a>, which is a bit like the Windows-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wise_Solutions">WISE</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InstallShield">InstallShield</a> installers of old (except they don’t require root access.) You download and run the installer as your normal user, hit Next-&gt;Next-&gt;Next and your game is installed. Full desktop integration, no giant alternate runtimes, no root permissions, no service required. Any ISV can ship software this way: just a self-installing executable shipped directly to users.</p>
<p>It’s not perfect. In particular mojosetup doesn’t install missing dependencies (yet) and GOG doesn’t totally follow the XDG specs for install paths (yet). These are minor, fixable problems, nothing on the scale of Flatpak. This is <em>simple</em>, this is true freedom, and the contrast in user experience is striking. I would take a mojosetup installer over an AppImage or Flatpak or Steam any day of the week.</p>
<p>For developers, yes, this may be harder than making an AppImage. There will still be occasional bugs that crop up between library versions. There will still be occasional differences between distributions. These are things you can work around. It may be painful at first but it will be worth it: you will provide a much superior user experience by working around the issues with your users’ libraries rather than attempting to replace them.</p>
<h4 id="forcing-distributions-to-maintain-compatibility">Forcing Distributions to Maintain Compatibility</h4>
<p>The backwards compatibility situation will continue to get better with time. The more proprietary software is shipped for the native Linux desktop, the less likely major distributions will accept upstream breakage. Imagine if millions of office workers used Excel on Ubuntu. How loudly do you think businesses would complain if a distribution upgrade broke it?</p>
<p>In 2014, Linus Torvalds suggested that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PmHRSeA2c8&amp;t=648s">Valve could save the Linux desktop</a>. He hoped they would publish a large volume of proprietary games that depended on the Linux desktop core libraries, finally forcing distributions to preserve their ABI. Unfortunately, as he predicted, that didn’t happen. Instead of relying on the native runtime libraries Steam replaced most of them with its own.</p>
<p>Steam needed to replace some libraries to make games work back in 2012. Today this is no longer necessary. So why are they still pushing their runtimes? How much progress could we make if Steam deprecated their runtimes, abandoned containerization for new games, and let all new games just use the native system libraries? How loudly do you think gamers would complain if a distribution upgrade broke their favourite game?</p>
<p>A few years ago Canonical decided to drop 32-bit libraries from Ubuntu 19.10. After much outrage, including <a href="https://itsfoss.com/ubuntu-19-10-drops-32-bit-support/">Wine and Steam threatening to drop support for Ubuntu</a>, they reversed their decision. Imagine how stable Ubuntu could be if Steam games depended on even more of the system libraries.</p>
<p>To any library developers reading this, it’s hard to over-emphasize how important backwards compatibility is to the popularity of a platform. Backwards compatibility is a major part of why Windows is still the dominant desktop OS. Microsoft has managed to keep the Win32 API stable for over 25 years. GUI apps built for Windows 95 still work out of the box on Windows 10. Businesses actually care about this! They use ancient proprietary software that is critical to their business whose source code has long been lost to the sands of time. A platform that breaks their software is no platform at all.</p>
<h4 id="the-gtk-problem">The GTK problem</h4>
<p>There is one glaring exception to my claims regarding Linux library stability. That exception is GTK. <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/mortenw/2014/06/23/how-does-one-create-a-gtk-application/">GTK famously breaks their libraries</a> with reckless abandon. This has historically been one of the biggest problems with shipping a binary app for Linux.</p>
<p>I believe this is partly due to a militant position on free software. Some advocates believe so strongly that users should be able to recompile their software that they force them to do so. They break libraries seemingly on purpose just to say, “Recompile! Oh you can’t? That’ll teach you to use binary software!” Of course users don’t want to recompile their software, but what users actually want is usually lost on GNOME developers.</p>
<p>With the recent release of GTK 4, there is little reason to believe the situation will improve. At one point they proposed <a href="https://davmac.wordpress.com/2016/07/05/why-do-we-keep-building-rotten-foundations/">bumping the soname on all major <em>and minor</em> releases</a>. Thankfully they have <a href="https://blog.gtk.org/2016/09/01/versioning-and-long-term-stability-promise-in-gtk/">reversed course</a>, but their latest versioning scheme still indicates their desire to accelerate the pace of major releases, allowing them to more frequently make breaking changes and remove deprecated functions. They do at least intend to remain ABI stable within a major release series, but given their track record, by the time anyone trusts GTK 4 to remain stable it will be obsolete.</p>
<p>This sounds like bad news, but there is a silver lining here: while they’re mucking about with GTK 4, they <em>aren’t</em> breaking GTK 3.</p>
<p>The ongoing transition to GTK 4 gives us an opportunity here. The GTK 3 ABI is finally a stable target, and it’s still pre-installed in most distributions because lots of built-in apps haven’t upgraded yet. If we can get a sufficient number of binary apps depending on it, distributions will be forced to maintain it and even pre-install it “forever”, the same way Microsoft maintains the Win32 API “forever”.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend that all app developers (open source or otherwise) delay upgrading to GTK 4 as long as possible. The longer we can delay the switch, the more stable GTK 3 will be. If the GTK team want us to use GTK 4, they will need to prove its stability over many years, not simply replace it with GTK 5.</p>
<p>I’m not saying GTK 3 is good. All I’m saying is it exists. No other toolkit can claim to be practical for desktop apps <em>and</em> relatively stable <em>and</em> pre-installed on the vast majority of Linux desktops. We all hope something better will come along one day but in the meantime GTK 3 is what we’ve got.</p>
<p>There has never been a better time to ship a binary app that targets the Linux desktop. And I don’t mean targets its own bundled runtime; I mean truly targets the user’s runtime environment. The time is now.</p>
<h2 id="is-flatpak-fixable">Is Flatpak Fixable?</h2>
<p>Here’s the thing. I actually think <a href="https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap">Bubblewrap</a>, the sandboxing tool used by Flatpak (and now Steam), is pretty good. It’s the key technology to make app sandboxing good enough to compete with Android or iOS. If it was used to hide sensitive stuff like <code>/home</code> but otherwise just mounted the native <code>/usr</code> straight into the sandbox, it could be great. Unfortunately, Flatpak does the exact opposite.</p>
<p>If the Flatpak developers truly want an app distribution system that rivals Android and iOS, the sandbox, permissions and portal system should be the only focus.</p>
<p>They should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abandon everything related to runtimes, and instead mount the native <code>/usr</code> (or a restricted set of core libraries from <code>/usr</code>) read-only into each container;</li>
<li>Add metadata to Flatpaks to declare library dependencies that the Flatpak service will install with the host distribution’s package manager (perhaps with generated <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MetaPackages">meta-packages</a> that can be cleanly removed);</li>
<li>Build a fine-grained user-interactive runtime permission system that requires the app to make Flatpak-specific API calls to activate permission dialogs; and</li>
<li>Deprecate install-time permissions (especially filesystem access) and remove all apps from Flathub that use them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under this system, apps would be encouraged to statically link many of their dependencies, but use the system GTK/Qt/SDL, OpenGL/Vulkan, OpenSSL/curl, and other large or security-critical libraries. The community could maintain guidelines and wrappers to make apps that dynamically link against the system libraries cross-version and cross-distribution. Apps would be expected to make changes to run sandboxed and request permissions directly through a Flatpak client API.</p>
<p>This is much more akin to how iOS and Android work. But it means abandoning like 95% of Flatpak. It would be such a drastic change that they might as well start over under a different name. I don’t see it happening.</p>
<p>An app store based on a sandboxing technology for native apps is a reasonable idea. I certainly don’t think it should be used for everything though. I don’t think it’s at all necessary for software like Excel or Photoshop. Users do not care about sandboxing those sorts of apps and their vendors will refuse to be sandboxed anyway.</p>
<p>But for small apps and games from independent developers, a proper sandboxed app marketplace can in theory increase their reach. It can eliminate much of the trust that would otherwise be necessary to run them on your computer and can bring native apps closer to the ease of use of web apps.</p>
<p>It’s certainly not easier for developers, but good native apps still provide such a vastly better user experience than web apps that it’s possible a proper sandboxed app store can create a resurgence in native apps. Microsoft obviously failed with their attempt, but macOS kind of didn’t. Maybe there is a way Linux can succeed as well.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Snap and Flatpak in their current incarnations have been around for at least five years. AppImage, Steam and Docker have been around even longer. None of the above is new. The problems with alternate runtimes were known from the very beginning, yet little progress has been made in fixing them. I don’t believe these are growing pains of a new technology. These are fundamental problems that are mostly not fixable.</p>
<p>All of these technologies are essentially building an entire OS on top of another OS just to avoid the challenges of backwards compatibility. In doing so, they create far more problems than they solve. Problems of compatibility are best solved by the OS, the real one, not some containerized bastardization on top. We need to make apps that run natively, that use the system libraries as much as possible. We need to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko&amp;t=3176s">drastically simplify everything</a> if we have any hope of attracting proprietary software to Linux.</p>
<p>If you are a Linux distribution maintainer, please understand what all of these solutions are trying to accomplish. All your hard work in building your software repository, maintaining your libraries, testing countless system configurations, designing a consistent user experience… they are trying to throw all of that away. Every single one of these runtime packaging mechanisms is trying to subvert the operating system, replacing as much as they can with their own. Why would you support this?</p>
<p>I implore you, do not use these packaging tools. Don’t add their services to your Linux distributions, don’t use apps packaged this way, and don’t ship apps that use them. Mass containerization and alternate runtimes cannot possibly be the future of desktop apps on Linux. If this is really the direction it’s going, the future will be so shitty that we’ll all end up back on macOS or Windows.</p>
<p>Personally, I’m much more interested in how to get Excel and Photoshop on Linux rather than untrustworthy drive-by apps and games, so I don’t really care about sandboxing, permissions, portals, app stores, alternate runtimes or really any of the stuff Flatpak does. Those are all counter-productive to convincing Microsoft and Adobe to port their software suites to Linux. Attracting these vendors will only happen by empowering them with a stable platform, not locking them in a box.</p>
<p>In future posts I’ll be going over some of the problems with targeting desktop Linux directly, presenting some of the stuff I’m working on, and hopefully coming up with real solutions that don’t depend on alternate runtimes.</p>
<p><em>Updates: A link to libportal was added, a reference to AppImageLauncher was added, and the description of GTK 4’s versioning scheme was corrected.</em></p>

<p>During summer vacation car rides as a kid, I remember the thrill of seeing an unusual license plate from a faraway state. There were 50 possible plates to see (plus D.C.) each with distinct colors and often the state motto. Today the game of license plate bingo has gotten incredibly complex.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By my count, there are currently 8,291 different vehicle license plates offered by the 50 states and the District of Columbia. States now offer a vast menu of personalized plate options for a dizzying array of organizations, professions, sports teams, causes and other groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My count was conducted over June and July 2023, so this should be considered a snapshot, as I'm sure some plates have changed already. </p>
<p>For years, members of the military and veterans have been able to pick plates reflecting the honors they have received and the missions they have served in. Drivers have also been able to pick plates drawing attention to a large number of medical conditions such as breast cancer, downs syndrome, diabetes and autism, raising funds for various foundations through registration fees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doctors, first responders and even amateur radio operators have long been able to pick a plate reflecting their affiliations. But today, if you are a realtor, accountant, architect, chiropractor, pharmacist or optician you too can share your profession with a customized plate in several states.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course not just anyone can grab many of these specialized plates. Proof of service and professional credentials are required to qualify for many of these plates. Some are reserved for members of the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Senate. </p>
<p>You can even find the face of Dolly Parton on Tennessee's "Dollywood Foundation For Children" plate, and don't miss aging rocker Alice Cooper who you can find on Arizona's "Alice Cooper’s Solid Rock" plate (raising funds for his non-profit that provides free music lessons for kids). </p>

<h2 id="too-many-plates">Too Many Plates?</h2>
<p>Maryland ranks 19th in the United States with an estimated 2022 population of 6.1 million residents. But Maryland leads the pack when it comes to the number of license plates it offers drivers. I counted 989 distinct plates listed on the Maryland Department of Motor Vehicles’ website.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/08/Artboard-1@2x-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1742" height="2598" srcset="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/Artboard-1@2x-1.png 600w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/Artboard-1@2x-1.png 1000w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/08/Artboard-1@2x-1.png 1600w, https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/content/images/2023/08/Artboard-1@2x-1.png 1742w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>A chart showing the number of license plates issued per state in June / July 2023, with Maryland leading the pack at 989 plates.</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Maryland caving enthusiasts will be glad to know they can pick a “National Speleological Society” plate (although only one such plate was issued between 2018 and 2022). Likewise the “American Sewing Guild”, “Baltimore Yacht Club” and “Westie Rescue, Inc.” are among the organizations with only a single plate issued during this time period. Maryland “Barbershop Quartet Singers” did slightly better with three plates issued in this time period, just ahead of “Baltimore Rock Opera Society’s” two plates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Texas, the second most populous state with nearly five times the population of Maryland offers the second largest number of license plates, coming in at 476 designs. Texas has taken a more practical approach to accommodating the demand for custom plates, outsourcing the whole effort to a private company called My Plates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hawaii offers the fewest number of plates, with just 14 designs to pick from (plus decals with messages drivers can attach). But a small number of plates offered doesn’t mean lower quality plates. In 2022, the <a href="https://www.alpca.org/bestplate/2022/?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com"><u>Automobile License Plate Collector’s Association</u></a> chose Hawaii’s beautiful “Polynesian Voyaging” as the "Best New Plate”. The “Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park” is also quite beautiful.</p>

<p>The explosion of full color images on special plates has also created some concerns for law enforcement’s use of Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs), which automatically scan the plates of cars as they drive down the road or through tolls. Many police cars are equipped with ALPRs that <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy-technology/location-tracking/automatic-license-plate-readers?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com"><u>scoop up all of the plates</u></a> that drive by. A <a href="https://www.aamva.org/getmedia/97faaff8-b5b3-4490-989c-0ed4f7244edd/LicensePlateReaderProgramBestPracticesGuide-October2021.pdf?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com"><u>report</u></a> by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators warned that high contrast backgrounds in these special plates can cause readability issues for ALPRs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some states have tried to reign in the sheer number of new plates being proposed each year, but with little success. In 2010, the Florida Senate <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2016/01/22/florida-lawmakers-cant-stop-loving-specialty-license-plates/?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com"><u>tried to restrict plates</u></a> only to designs that had at least 4,000 pre-orders, but the measure did not advance.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="animals-and-conservation">Animals and Conservation</h2>
<p>Some of the most popular special plates feature animals and messages about nature conservation. Whales, sharks, moose, salamanders, eagles, deer, butterflies, salmon, trout and loons can be found on plates around the country. Fees from many of these animal plates help fund state conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Animal conservation plates were some of Florida’s most lucrative license plate designs for the 2020-2021 fiscal year. The “Sea Turtle” plate brought in $2.4 million, “Save the Manatee” brought in $1.3 million and “Protect Wild Dolphins” brought in $1.1 million in revenue. Texas’ “Horned Lizard” plate raised $6.5 million in fiscal year 2019. California’s “Protect Our Coast &amp; Ocean” featuring a whale tail pulled in $1.1 million in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="controversial-plates">Controversial Plates</h2>
<p>License plates have been the subject of dozens of legal cases challenging the messages imprinted on them by the state. In 1976, a New Hampshire resident <a href="https://www.nhpr.org/news/2017-11-01/live-free-die-decades-old-fight-over-n-h-motto-to-get-supreme-court-shout-out?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com"><u>successfully pleaded his case </u></a>to the U.S. Supreme Court that he had the right to obscure the state’s motto “Live Free or Die” on his plates, which conflicted with his religious beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, a group of atheists in Mississippi <a href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/13182/atheists-sue-mississippi-for-in-god-we-trust-plates-i-dont-want-jesus-riding-on-my-car?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com"><u>sued the state</u></a> when the governor changed the state seal to include the words “In God We Trust”, which appeared on the standard license plate design. The plaintiffs objected to the fact that there was no alternative design without the slogan without having to pay an extra fee for a special plate. The court found that the plaintiff's free speech argument was valid, but recently the Governor introduced a new standard plate that does not mention God, rendering the case moot. </p>
<p>"I consider it a victory because the Governor's previous comments suggest he would not have chosen a design without a religious reference if it were not for the pressure that was applied to him," wrote Jason Alan Griggs, one of the plaintiffs in the case in an email to Beautiful Public Data. </p>

<p>A 2016 <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/transportation/transportation-license-plate-policy-update?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com"><u>report</u></a> from the National Conference on State Legislatures (NCSL) warned state administrators of the controversy that can come with political messages on special plates. “Specialty license plate designs may encounter resistance, however. While courts have consistently stated that license plates are private speech, the fact that they are issued by government agencies can incite much controversy and debate,” said the report.</p>
<p>But the full scope of American political expression is not evenly distributed in the plates offered today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anti-abortion license plates such as “Choose Life” can be found in <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/choose-life-license-plates?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com"><u>34 states</u></a>. Only four states appear to offer pro-abortion rights plates. Nebraska and Pennsylvania offer Planned Parenthood plates, with Nebraska’s displaying “My Body, My Choice” on the tag. Virginia has a “Trust Women, Respect Choice” plate and Alaska offers “Pro-Family, Pro-Choice”.</p>
<p>At least nine states offer Revolutionary War Gadsden Flag “Don’t Tread on Me” plates. 22 states offer either “God Bless America” or “In God We Trust”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could only find three plates in the whole dataset that represented the LGBTQ community: “Indiana Youth Group”, “South Carolina Equality” and “Maryland Equality”. </p>
<p>Texas offers a "Juneteenth" plate, and Arkansas has a Martin Luther King, Jr. plate. I couldn't find any plates related to Black Lives Matters, which was surprising considering the scale of the civil rights movement in recent years. </p>
<h2 id="big-money-for-charities-and-for-the-state">Big Money for Charities and for the State</h2>
<p>Some organizations pull in huge amounts of money from the fees shared by the state. California’s well-publicized “<a href="https://www.artsplate.org/?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com"><u>Arts Plate</u></a>” which costs $50 initially with a $40 annual renewal (or $103 initially with an $83 annual renewal for personalized plates) pulled in $2.2 million for the California Arts Council non-profit in 2019. In 2022, the non-profit Blue Ridge Parkway Foundation raised $556,000 from its North Carolina specialty plate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>License plate fees also are major sources of revenue for state motor vehicle departments. Florida pulled in over $44 million just from specialty license plates in the 2020-2021 fiscal year. </p>
<h2 id="made-by-prison-labor">Made By Prison Labor</h2>
<p>Yes, license plates are still made by cheap prison labor in most states. 80% of all license plates issued in the U.S. today were made by state prisoners, with only 12 states opting out of the practice. According to a 2022 <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/human-rights/captive-labor-exploitation-of-incarcerated-workers?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com#:~:text=Our%20nation%20incarcerates%20more%20than,people%20working%20on%20the%20outside"><u>ACLU report on prison labor</u></a> in the U.S., many states offer no pay at all to prisoners, while the average hourly wage across the country was between 13 and 52 cents per hour.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>👨🏻‍💻</p><div><p><b><strong>Nerdbox</strong></b></p><p>For this post, I had to scrape data from 51 different state motor vehicle agencies. Every site was different, which created a challenge. Some sites like <a href="https://www.in.gov/bmv/registration-plates/license-plates-overview/license-plate-designs/?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com" rel="noreferrer">Indiana</a>'s and <a href="https://www.dol.wa.gov/vehicles-and-boats/license-plates/get-custom-plates/special-design-plates?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com" rel="noreferrer">Washington</a>'s were very nicely built, with easy to read lists of plates, large plate images and clean descriptive text. Other states (I'm looking at you <a href="https://www.dmv.nh.gov/sites/g/files/ehbemt416/files/inline-documents/list-of-plates-table.pdf?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com" rel="noreferrer">New Hampshire</a> and <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/passenger-plates-manual-0/download?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com" rel="noreferrer">Massachusetts</a>) did the minimum and just linked to a PDF with low-res blurry thumbnails of the plates.</p><p>I filed six freedom of information requests seeking plate issuance and revenue numbers, while some states helpfully published these numbers on their websites. You can find the responses in my <a href="https://github.com/jonkeegan/us-license-plates?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com" rel="noreferrer">GitHub repository</a> for this story, along with the dataset and thumbnail images.</p><p>Using some <a href="http://bit.ly/command-line-gfx?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com">command line graphics</a> (ImageMagick) I resized the plate images to a uniform 2:1 ratio and made the sizes consistent.</p><p>I used Jupyter Notebooks and matplotlib to analyze the data and make the chart.</p></div></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>BUFFALO, N.Y. – Inflammation is the body’s response to injury and infection, but it is also a factor that can lead people to use social media, according to a new study by a University at Buffalo communication researcher.<br></p><p>Across three studies involving more than 1,800 participants, the findings — published in the journal Brain, Behavior and Immunity — indicate that increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), which the liver makes in response to inflammation in the body, can promote social media use among middle-aged adults and college students.</p><p>“It seems that inflammation not only increases social media use, but our results show preliminary evidence that it’s also associated with using social media to specifically interact with other users, like direct messaging and posting to people’s pages. Interestingly, inflammation did not lead people to use social media for other purposes—for example, entertainment purposes like watching funny videos,” says David Lee, PhD, an assistant professor of communication in the UB College of Arts and Sciences, and the study’s first author.</p><p>“To our knowledge, this is the first evidence showing the role of the immune system as a potential antecedent to social media use.”</p><p>Social media platforms attract billions of users worldwide, which has led to questions about possible effects on physical and mental health. Lee and his co-authors, however, ask a more fundamental question: What draws people to use social media in the first place?</p><p>But inflammation as possible contributor? The association is not as unlikely as it might initially sound.</p><p>Although people generally think of psychological reasons, like boredom and loneliness, as drivers of social media use, a growing amount of research suggests that experimentally elevating inflammation promotes social engagement behavior. So Lee wondered to what extent normal circulating levels of a downstream biomarker for systemic inflammation, like CRP, might have on social media use.</p><p>If inflammation does indeed increase social affiliative motivation, it should also lead people to turn to social media, under such circumstances, as a means to fulfill social needs.</p><p>The current paper used an existing data set of middle-aged adults for the first study, who completed survey questionnaires and provided blood samples the researchers analyzed for CRP. The authors collected their own data for the second and third studies using similar methods for college students.</p><p>“Inflammation is typically followed by behaviors and symptoms associated with sickness that can help the body heal,” says Lee, an expert in the effects of social media use. “Humans are social beings, and when we’re sick or injured, it may be adaptive for us to approach others who can provide social support and care.”</p><p>Understanding and identifying when and why people use social media can inform intervention strategies that teach people when to seek connections, social support, or strengthen their offline relationships.</p><p>“If social media use is driven by the motivation to connect with others, we can teach people to use social media for that purpose,” he says.</p><p>The findings also shed light on how to effectively manage social media use.</p><p>“For some people the relationship between social media use and inflammation may be a positive feedback loop, a cycle where more social media use leads to more inflammation, and more inflammation then leads to more social media use,” he says.</p><p>Lee plans to continue working with his collaborators to gain more insight into how inflammation influences social behaviors online and offline, as well as whether the inflammation-social media use link may be different for specific populations, such as teenaged girls or individuals with low self-esteem.</p><p>“Following this line of research can further inform our understanding about the potential links between the body and daily social behavior,” he says.</p><p>Lee’s research team included Tao Jiang, PhD, postdoctoral researcher at Northwestern University, Jennifer Crocker, PhD, emeritus professor of psychology at The Ohio State University, and Baldwin Way, PhD, associate professor of psychology, also at Ohio State.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>I am sure that many of the erudite readers of this little book know <em>On the Origin of Species</em> by Charles Darwin inside and out. If there is someone who still has this gap in their education, you are urged to fill it without any further delay. Darwin’s book is fundamental for understanding how life works. And it is surprising to think how this book, which literally changed the history of the world, is actually only a summary of the countless observations that Darwin gathered for decades throughout the scientific disciplines and throughout the world in support of his theory of the evolution of living species. His plan, in fact, was to write a colossal and minutely detailed work that was meant to report all the fruits of his decades of research. It would be a work invulnerable to any and all criticism.</p>



<p>As is well known, things did not work out that way. Alfred Russel Wallace’s announcement that he had arrived at Darwin’s same conclusions regarding evolution induced Darwin to change his plans and summarize in <em>Origin</em> his most brilliant and most evidentially supported deductions, leaving the rest of the material for subsequent elaboration. Nevertheless, the enormous corpus that he was working on did not go to waste. On the contrary, the first two chapters of his magnum opus, which was supposed to be entitled simply <em>Natural Selection</em>, became the two volumes of <em>The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication</em>, and much of the rest of the material was readapted in the elaboration of his later works. In any event,<br>
in the third chapter of <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, dedicated to the famous “struggle for existence” that is the dominant motif of the whole book, Darwin tells a marvelous story of relationships. This story is essential for understanding both the bonds between living beings and how difficult it is to imagine the consequences of intervening in those relationships.</p>



<p>Darwin writes: what animals could you imagine to be more distant from one another than a cat and a bumblebee? Yet the ties that bind these two animals, though at first glance nonexistent, are on the contrary so strict that were they to be modified, the consequences would be so numerous and profound as to be unimaginable. Mice, argues Darwin, are among the principal enemies of bumblebees. They eat their larvae and destroy their nests. On the other hand, as everyone knows, mice are the favorite prey of cats. One consequence of this is that, in proximity to those villages with the most cats, one finds fewer mice and more bumblebees. So far so clear? Good, let’s go on.</p>



<p>Bumblebees are the primary pollinators of many vegetable species, and it is common knowledge that the greater the amount and the quality of pollination the greater the number of seeds produced by the plants. The number and the quality of seeds determines the greater or lesser presence of insects, which, as is well known, are the principal nutriment of numerous bird populations. We could go on like this, adding one group of living species to another, for hours on end: bacteria, fungi, cereals, reptiles, orchids, would succeed one another without pause, one by one, until we ran out of breath, like in those nursery rhymes that connect one event to another without interruption. The ecological relationships that Darwin brings to our attention tell us of a world of bonds much more complex and ungraspable than had ever previously been supposed. Relationships so complex as to connect everything to everything in a single network of the living.</p>



<p>There is a famous story along these lines told for the first time by the German biologists Ernst Haeckel and Carl Vogt. As the story goes, the fortunes of England would seem to depend on cats. By nourishing themselves on mice, cats increase the chances of survival of bumblebees, which, in turn, pollinate shamrocks, which then nourish the beef cows that provide the meat to nourish British sailors, thus permitting the British navy—which, as we all know, is the mainstay of the empire—to develop all of its power. T. H. Huxley, expanding on the joke, added that the true force of the empire was not cats but the perseverant love of English spinsters for cats, which kept the cat population so high. In any event, underlying the joke is the simple truth that all living species are connected to one another in some way or other by relationships, visible or hidden, and that acting directly on one species, or simply altering its environment, can have totally unexpected consequences. Darwin tells us that trying to imagine the final consequences of any alteration in these relationships would be as “hopeless” as throwing up a handful of sawdust on a windy day and trying to predict where each particle would land.<sup>9</sup> History is full of such attempts, almost always gone wrong, to modify the presence or the activities of single species.</p>



<blockquote><p>T. H. Huxley, expanding on the joke, added that the true force of the empire was not cats but the perseverant love of English spinsters for cats, which kept the cat population so high.</p></blockquote>



<p>Let’s take as an example the affair of the color red. When Cortés and his conquistadores first entered the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán (present- day Mexico City), they found a very rich and very populous city (in Europe at the time only Naples, Paris, and Constantinople had larger populations). In the enormous market square, a quantity of goods never seen before, many of them of great value, were just waiting to be exported to European markets. Among them were bales of finely woven cotton and delicate yarns of an amazing carmine red. The dye used by the Aztecs to produce this incredible tone of red was obtained from a tiny insect, the cochineal, that lives on cactus plants (various species belonging to the genus <em>Opuntia</em>, the prickly pear). The color was so beautiful and precious that states under Aztec domination were required to furnish annually to the emperor a certain number of sacks full of cochineals as tribute. A fine brilliant carmine dye was, and still is, obtained from the dried bodies of these insects.</p>



<p>The production of this dye remained, for almost two and a half centuries, a monopoly of Spain, which guarded the secret jealously and made it into a widespread and highly profitable commerce in Europe. The Spanish sold their dye to whoever could afford it, but above all to the English, who soon became its most enthusiastic and passionate buyers. Enamored of Spanish carmine, which they used to color their military uniforms (their famous <em>red coats</em>), the English found a way to buy it at a high price even during their frequent wars against Spain, in which those very uniforms were used. As Italians say, the heart will not be ruled. That special hue of carmine provided by the Spanish dyes was essential for the British army. Any other red would have made their coats less red, demeaning the glorious nobility of the uniform. After all, what kind of image would they have projected in battle with faded uniforms? Their enemies would have died laughing; and that was no way to win a war.</p>



<blockquote><p>Enamored of Spanish carmine, which they used to color their military uniforms (their famous red coats), the English found a way to buy it at a high price even during their frequent wars against Spain, in which those very uniforms were used.</p></blockquote>



<p>For the next 250 years, despite the best efforts of the English to free themselves from this commercial yoke, the secret of that prodigious dye remained unknown to all but a select fortunate few of Spanish producers. But no production secret can stay that way forever, and so in the closing years of the eighteenth century, British spies succeeded in spiriting away the tightly kept formula: in order to obtain the longed-for carmine, you needed cochineals, and to get cochineals you had to have prickly pears. With the right information in hand, all that remained was to find the right place to begin production. There was no shortage of candidates; the empire was enormous and spread over all the continents. The choice fell on the fortunate Australia. Prickly pears had never grown there, but its climate was perfect for their rapid growth, so both prickly pears and cochineals were imported.</p>



<p>The results were not long in coming. The cochineals died immediately on arrival in Australia, while the prickly pears, useless at this point, were abandoned to their Australian destiny. A destiny of conquerors. Unlike the cochineals, the prickly pears found the Australian environment ideal for their dispersion. With no natural enemies or obstacles and with lots of birds to disperse their seeds, in just a few years the plant spread throughout a vast territory. Having arrived in Australia from Brazil in 1788, the prickly pear was dispersed over an estimated seventy-three million acres, and its expansion did not stop there. It went on conquering new territories at an astounding rate of 1.2 million acres per year. Thus, large amounts of cultivated land, farms, pasture, and agricultural areas of Queensland and New South Wales were invaded by prickly pears, driving away farmers and impeding any kind of productive activity. The problem soon became very serious, forcing the authorities, starting in the second half of the nineteenth century, to look for possible solutions.</p>

<hr>



<p>In 1901, the government of New South Wales offered £5,000 to anyone who came up with an idea to block the invasion. In 1907, even though the reward had been doubled, it seemed that no one was able to provide an adequate solution. Naturally, there was no shortage of far-fetched proposals. Many people came forward with stratagems that were, let’s say, radical. Among them: increase the number of rabbits as predators of the prickly pear, another interesting story of species introduction gone awry. Or, another gem, evacuate an enormous area of land and use airplanes to spray mustard gas (the gas widely used in World War I) to exterminate the animal population, which was responsible for the dispersal of prickly pear seeds. Fortunately, neither of these proposals was taken into consideration, and for decades the only weapon against the devastating advance of the species was to cut down and burn the plants.</p>



<p>Then, in 1926, a solution was finally found: an Argentine lepidopteran (moth) known as <em>Cactoblastis cactorum</em>, a parasite of various species of <em>Opuntia</em>. By nourishing themselves on cladodes (as the modified leaves of prickly pears are called) the moth larvae managed to debilitate the prickly peril in many parts of Australia. This stratagem enjoyed an extraordinary and unexpected success. In a short time, except in the cooler parts of Australia, where the moth spread less effectively, the prickly pear menace was eliminated.</p>



<p>So it all worked out? In part. Although the introduction of the <em>Cactoblastis</em> in Australia is often cited as a successful operation, so much so that the community of Boonarga, just east of the city of Chincilla in Queensland, even dedicated its Cactoblastis Memorial Hall to the moth. Nature always wants the last word. Over time, populations of prickly pears resistant to the parasite evolved in Australia, and this is a first, though not fatal, complication that will, however, require a more careful control of the cactus population in the future. But the second and more important difficulty is that the Australian success in the use of the lepidopteran induced many other nations with analogous prickly pear problems to go down the same road, with totally unexpected results. As Darwin advised us, trying to predict what will happen in a situation like this is like trying to predict where a piece of sawdust will land on a windy day.</p>



<p>In the 1960s the <em>Cactoblastis</em> was introduced to the Caribbean islands of Montserrat and Antigua as a control agent of the local cactus populations. In Australia, the sawdust fell in the right spot, but in Central America, it didn’t. The moth, in fact, using all kinds of carriers, spread quickly to Puerto Rico, Barbados, the Cayman Islands, Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. Through the importation of prickly pears from the Dominican Republic, it arrived for the first time in Florida in 1989, and from there it began to spread at a velocity of over a hundred miles per year along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. During its expansion, by now completely out of control, this parasite has endangered many cactus populations in the United States and the Caribbean, threatening entire ecosystems, some of them unique. A classic example is the attack on the prickly pear on the Bahamian island of San Salvador, one of the main sources of food for the only extant populations of <em>Cyclura</em> iguanas.</p>



<p>And as if all this were not enough, hurricanes, involuntary transport, and trade have recently transported the <em>Cactoblastis</em> to Mexico, where it has been sighted for the first time on the island of Mujeres, just off the Yucatan peninsula. In Mexico, unlike in Australia, the prickly pear is a vital plant. It even appears in the national emblem and on the flag. Its fruit and cladodes are a staple food for the population. Prickly pears are used to feed livestock in periods of drought, and some species of <em>Opuntia</em> are still used by the cochineal dye industry. If the <em>Cactoblastis</em> were to spread to the Mexico mainland, the damage would be enormous.</p>



<p>But no other natural disaster provoked by humans following rash decisions based on inadequate knowledge of natural relationships will ever be able to rival what Mao Tse-Tung accomplished in the late 1950s. Between 1958 and 1962, the Chinese Communist Party led an economic and social movement in the whole country that came to be known as the Great Leap Forward. This was an enormous collective endeavor meant to transform China in just a few years from an agricultural nation into a great industrial power. The movement’s results, unfortunately, fell dramatically short of what had been hoped. The reforms through which the party intended to effect this radical national change involved every area of Chinese life, and some of them had devastating effects for the country.</p>



<p>In 1958, Mao was rightly convinced that some of the scourges that had plagued the Chinese for centuries had to be eradicated immediately and in a radical fashion. Keep in mind that when the Communists took power in the autumn of 1949, they found themselves governing a nation gravely distressed by a soaring incidence of infectious diseases: plague, cholera, measles, tuberculosis, polio, and malaria were endemic in most of the country. Cholera epidemics were very frequent, and the infant mortality rate ran as high as 30 percent.<sup>10</sup></p>



<p>The creation of a national health service and a massive vaccination campaign against plague and measles were the first, meritorious, actions undertaken to improve the situation. Water purification and sewage treatment infrastructure was installed throughout the country, and imitating what had been done previously in the Soviet Union, health care personnel were trained and sent into rural areas to serve as proper health care administrators, educating the population in basic health and hygiene practices and treating diseases with all available resources. But, obviously this wasn’t enough; the diffusion of carriers that spread disease had to be curtailed: mosquitoes, responsible for malaria; rats, spreaders of plague; and, finally, flies had to be exterminated. These three scourges from which China had to be liberated were soon joined by a fourth: sparrows, which by eating fruit and rice cultivated laboriously in the fields were one of the most terrible enemies of the people. Chinese scientists had calculated that each sparrow ate ten pounds of grain per year. So for every million sparrows killed, food for 60,000 people would be saved.</p>



<p>This information was the basis for the “Four Pests Campaign,” and sparrows were public enemy number one. Today, any proposal for ecosystem modification as radical as this call to eliminate four species from a territory as vast as China would, obviously, be considered ill-considered. But in 1958, lots of people thought it seemed like a good idea. So the party’s campaign to recruit the citizenry to combat these four pests was begun. Millions of posters were printed up illustrating the necessary eradication and the means to implement it.</p>



<blockquote><p>Chinese scientists had calculated that each sparrow ate ten pounds of grain per year. So for every million sparrows killed, food for 60,000 people would be saved.</p></blockquote>



<p>For the battle against sparrows, the people were told to give no quarter and to use all available means. One of the directives was to frighten the sparrows with noise, produced in any way possible, so they would be forced to fly constantly without ever coming to rest, until they fell to the ground exhausted. Pans, casseroles, gongs, rifles, trumpets, horns, plates, tambourines—any source of noise was put to use. Here is a description of what happened by a Russian observer, Mikhail A. Klochko,<sup>11</sup> who was working as a consultant in Beijing when the four pests campaign was launched:</p>



<p><em>I was awakened early in the morning by the sound of a woman screaming. Rushing over to the window, I saw a young woman running back and forth on the roof of a nearby building, frenetically shaking a bamboo pole with a large sheet tied to it. Suddenly, the woman stopped yelling, apparently to catch her breath, but an instant later, down at the end of the street, a drum started beating, and the woman went back to her blood-curdling screams and the mad shaking of her peculiar banner. This went on for several minutes. Then the drums stopped beating and the woman fell silent. I then realized that, on all the upper floors of my hotel, women dressed in white were waving sheets and towels that were meant to prevent sparrows from landing on the building. This was the opening of the Great Sparrow campaign. All day long I heard drums, gunshots, and screams and saw fluttering sheets, but never at any time did I see a single sparrow. I cannot say whether the poor birds had perceived the mortal danger and flown off in advance to safer terrain, or if there had never been any sparrows in that place. But the battle went on without abatement until noon, with the entire staff of the hotel mobilized and participating: porters, front office managers, interpreters, chambermaids and all the rest.</em></p>



<p>Although Klochko’s account makes it seem that all this activity was not very effective, the actual results were, unfortunately, devastatingly successful. The government acclaimed the schools, working groups, and governmental agencies that achieved the best results in terms of number of pests killed. The estimates provided by the Chinese government, totally unreliable for their enormity, indicated a billion and a half rats and a billion sparrows killed. Even though they are enormously exaggerated, these figures nevertheless tell us of a massacre whose dramatic consequences would soon be evident. Sparrows, in fact, do not feed exclusively on hulled grains. On the contrary, their main food supply are insects.</p>



<p>In 1959, Mao, realizing his mistake, replaced the sparrows as a target pest with beetles, but the damage had already been done. The almost total lack in China not only of sparrows (which had to be reintroduced from the USSR) but of practically all other birds led to an immeasurable increase in the insect population. The number of locusts began to increase exponentially, and immense swarms of insects making their way through the fields of China destroyed most of the crops. From 1959 to 1961, a series of ill-starred events partially related to natural disasters and partly caused by the mistaken reforms of the Great Leap Forward (the idea to exterminate the sparrows being one of the worst), led to three years of famine so harsh that it caused the deaths of an estimated 20 to 40 million people.</p>



<p>Playing with something whose working mechanisms are not well known is clearly dangerous. The consequences can be completely unpredictable. The strength of ecological communities is one of the engines of life on Earth. At every level, from the microscopic to the macroscopic, it is these communities, understood<br>
as relationships among the living, that allow life to persist.</p>

  <div data-layout="50-50">
      <p>Before you settle on basing design decisions on a handful of strict breakpoints, make sure you consider the vast fragmentation of screen sizes and browser viewports.</p>
      <div>
        <p>Here at <a href="https://set.studio/">Set Studio</a>, we conducted a little casual experiment to answer “how fragmented are viewport sizes?”. We gathered over <strong>120,000 datapoints</strong> with over <strong>2,300 unique viewport sizes</strong>. The data mainly came from users in the USA and Europe, therefore it is not necessarily representative of a global audience, but still useful for this article.</p>
<p>The experiment only ran for 48 hours, but the data we got was pretty interesting. Let’s dive in and take a look.</p>

  <h2>What does 120,000 datapoints represent?</h2>
  <p>It's important to understand just how many 120,000 is in relative terms. For comparison, let’s presume each datapoint is a person.</p>
  <div data-layout="50-50">
    
    <p>Wembley stadium has a capacity of <strong>90,000</strong>, so our datapoints could fill Wembley once and still fill another third of the available capacity.</p>
  </div>
  <div data-layout="50-50">
    <p>The population of our home town, Cheltenham, is around <strong>116,000</strong> so our datapoints could almost populate the entire town!</p>

        <p>If we slice out the top 20 unique viewports from the gathered datapoints, it’s primarily small sizes. You could presume these are mobile devices — especially the top 10 — but it’s also worth considering that viewports vary on conditions too.</p>
<p>Even on one iOS device, there's a minimum of 3 environments a website could find itself in, based on operating system states.</p>

    <h2>"Mobile" vs "Desktop"</h2>
    <p>We've only captured width and height for each datapoint for this experiment and these dimensions were gathered using <code>window.innerWidth</code> and <code>window.innerHeight</code>. We decided to treat any width greater than 800px as “desktop”, or as we prefer to call it, a large viewport.</p>
    <div data-layout="50-50">
        <p>You might be thinking “800px is way too small for desktop”, which if we were measuring screens, you would be right. We’re <strong>measuring viewports here though</strong>. A viewport is the window size of the browser, not the screen size.</p>
<p>If you’re on a desktop device reading this, how many windows are filling the entire screen? How much screen space does the browser you’re reading from take up?</p>
<p>It’s safest to presume that users on desktop or laptop devices are not filling their entire screen with a browser. Heck, even tablet users <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/ipad/ipad08c9970c/ipados">don't fill the screen with a browser</a>, so make sure you <strong>consider that when figuring out your larger viewport designs</strong> — especially if you’re concealing content for small screens and showing it for “desktop users”. Ask yourself if needing to hide content for small screens and not larger screens means that content is as necessary as you initially thought.</p>
<p>Also consider the sheer fragmentation of “desktop” viewports when working with layouts. Yes, configuring layouts and font sizes using media queries might make sense if you’re using the classic 768px, 1024px and 1280px breakpoints, but what about the vast array of sizes in between?</p>

      <div>
        <p>The main point we’re trying to get across is that you simply do not know how users are going to visit your website or web app. Instead of making design decisions on strict, limited breakpoints, keep in mind the sheer amount of fragmentation there is in viewports.</p>
        <p>Our recommendation to clients is always to be the <a href="https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/">browser’s mentor, not its micromanager</a>. Create flexible rules and allow the browser to do what it does best: calculate the best outcome based on the conditions it finds itself in.</p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <p>This goes all the way back to planning your projects too. When mapping out page content, ask yourself how it will be for the weird viewport sizes that don’t fit the typical mould? Always try to simplify and condense content to make it useful for everyone.</p>
<p>And finally, always remember that you <strong>do not know what conditions your website will be visited on</strong> and you have little to no control over that. Accept that lack of control and use the limitations to breed creativity and also, laser focus your UX work.</p>
<p>It’s certainly how we do it, here at <a href="https://set.studio/">Set Studio</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
        <article role="article">
  

  <div>
    <p>I was recently trying to figure out how likely a bunch of end-to-end tests were to be flaky, and wanted to gather some stats about their pass/fail rates on my local machine before including them in a broader test suite.</p>

<p>These tests run for a long time, as they execute extensive scenarios against a live service over HTTP. In this post I’ll share the approach I ended up with using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">GNU Parallel</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>A quick aside</strong>: If you wanna follow along and run the upcoming examples in your own terminal, use this command to generate some test files. They’ll emulate a flaky test by sleeping between 5-15 seconds, then randomly exiting with a failure (exit code 1) or success (exit code 0):</p>

<div><pre><code>parallel <span>"echo 'sleep </span><span>\$</span><span>((</span><span>\$</span><span>RANDOM%10+5)) &amp;&amp; [ </span><span>\$</span><span>((</span><span>\$</span><span>RANDOM%2)) = 1 ] </span><span>\</span><span>
  &amp;&amp; printf PASS </span><span>\</span><span>
  || (printf FAIL &amp;&amp; exit 1)'"</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>'&gt;'</span> potentially_flaky_<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>.sh ::: <span>{</span>1..5<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<hr>

<p>Typically to gather flakiness stats I’d use a couple of nested loops, one for each test I want to run, and another for each attempt. I like doing this kind of stuff in <code>bash</code> for its simplicity/portability:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>tests</span><span>=(</span>
  potentially_flaky_1.sh
  potentially_flaky_2.sh
  potentially_flaky_3.sh
  potentially_flaky_4.sh
  potentially_flaky_5.sh
<span>)</span>

<span># For each test</span>
<span>for </span><span>test </span><span>in</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>tests</span><span>[@]</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>;</span> <span>do</span>
  <span># For each attempt of that test (1 through to 10)</span>
  <span>for </span>attempt <span>in</span> <span>$(</span><span>seq </span>1 10<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>do</span>
    <span># Capture timestamp for when the test started</span>
    <span>start</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>date</span> <span>"+%s"</span><span>)</span>
    <span># Run the test and capture its exit code</span>
    bash <span>"</span><span>$test</span><span>"</span> <span>&gt;</span> /dev/null
    <span>status</span><span>=</span><span>$?</span>
    <span># Calculate duration of the test run</span>
    <span>end</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>date</span> <span>"+%s"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>duration</span><span>=</span><span>$((</span>end <span>-</span> start<span>))</span>

    <span># Print results</span>
    <span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>$test</span><span> attempt </span><span>$attempt</span><span> took </span><span>${</span><span>duration</span><span>}</span><span>s "</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>[[</span> status <span>-eq</span> 0 <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then
      </span><span>printf</span> <span>"PASS</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
    <span>else
      </span><span>printf</span> <span>"FAIL</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
    <span>fi
  done
done</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This approach ended up being tediously slow though… since the tests take a while to execute, running them sequentially wasn’t gonna cut it.</p>

<p>I knew about GNU Parallel, but had never used it before. <code>$ man parallel</code> and 15 minutes later, I was “living life in the parallel lane” (as the <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1146014">GNU Parallel book</a> encourages you to do!)</p>

<p>Rewriting the above to work using <code>parallel</code> ended up looking like:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>tests</span><span>=(</span>
  potentially_flaky_1.sh
  potentially_flaky_2.sh
  potentially_flaky_3.sh
  potentially_flaky_4.sh
  potentially_flaky_5.sh
<span>)</span>

parallel <span>--progress</span> <span>--jobs</span> 5 <span>--delay</span> 2 <span>--timeout</span> 3600 <span>--shuf</span> <span>--results</span> out.csv <span>\</span>
  bash <span>{</span>1<span>}</span> ::: <span>${</span><span>tests</span><span>[@]</span><span>}</span> ::: <span>{</span>1..10<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The joy of finding the right tool for the job can’t be beat - more performance and functionality, with less code!</p>

<p>Let’s go into a bit more detail…</p>

<h3 id="passing-inputs">Passing inputs</h3>

<p>In GNU Parallel, you specify a command that is to be executed in parallel. In the example provided, the command is <code>bash {1}</code>. The <code>{1}</code> is a placeholder that gets replaced with each input value (if you have more than one input you can use <code>{2}</code>, <code>{3}</code> etc).</p>

<p>The inputs to the command are specified after the <code>:::</code> operator. In this case, the inputs are the array of test scripts (<code>${tests[@]}</code>) and a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 (<code>{1..10}</code>). These inputs are provided to the command in all possible combinations.</p>

<p>So in this case, we have 5 test scripts and we want to run each one 10 times, <code>parallel</code> will execute each command 50 times in total.</p>

<h3 id="controlling-concurrency">Controlling concurrency</h3>

<p><code>parallel</code> provides a number of options that can be used to avoid resource contention, here are a few that I found useful for my tests:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>--jobs 5</code>: Caps the number of concurrent jobs to 5 (by default <code>parallel</code> will try to execute as many jobs as you have CPU cores).</li>
  <li><code>--delay 2</code>: Ensures each job waits for 2 seconds before starting, preventing a thundering herd problem.</li>
  <li><code>--timeout 3600</code>: Terminates any jobs that have been running for over an hour.</li>
  <li><code>--shuf</code>: Runs the jobs in a shuffled order.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="capturing-output">Capturing output</h3>

<p>By default the output of your command will be printed to your terminal, however in this case since I wanted to capture stats - using <code>parallel</code>’s capability to output a CSV file instead was very helpful:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>--results out.csv</code>: Outputs job completion results to the given file which includes duration, exit codes, and captured stdout/stderr.</li>
  <li><code>--progress</code> prints live progress as the jobs are executing.</li>
</ul>

<p>The CSV file ends up looking like this (only including the first lines for brevity):</p>

<div><pre><code>Seq,Host,Starttime,JobRuntime,Send,Receive,Exitval,Signal,Command,V1,V2,Stdout,Stderr
4,:,1692491267.732,6.025,0,4,1,0,"bash potentially_flaky_5.sh",potentially_flaky_5.sh,9,FAIL,
2,:,1692491263.646,12.025,0,4,0,0,"bash potentially_flaky_3.sh",potentially_flaky_3.sh,3,PASS,
1,:,1692491261.604,14.067,0,4,1,0,"bash potentially_flaky_5.sh",potentially_flaky_5.sh,2,FAIL,
5,:,1692491269.779,6.023,0,4,1,0,"bash potentially_flaky_1.sh",potentially_flaky_1.sh,3,FAIL,
3,:,1692491265.686,11.055,0,4,1,0,"bash potentially_flaky_4.sh",potentially_flaky_4.sh,8,FAIL,
</code></pre></div>

<p>It’d be trivial to use this output to aggregate/chart stats.</p>

<h3 id="exploring-further">Exploring further…</h3>

<p>This is barely scratching the surface of what <code>parallel</code> can do. I strongly recommend the excellent, free, and funny <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1146014">book by Parallel’s author Ole Tange</a>. The first chapter takes 15 minutes to get through and covers 80% of what you’re likely going to use.</p>

<p>The book covers things such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Distributing jobs across different hosts using SSH, a powerful feature for leveraging multiple machines.</li>
  <li>Monitoring the mean time for job completion and setting timeouts for jobs based on a percentage of the mean, providing more control over long-running tasks.</li>
  <li>Retrying if jobs are known to be failure prone.</li>
  <li>Resuming jobs if parallel execution stops midway, ensuring you don’t lose progress.</li>
  <li>Limiting amount of jobs that can run based on CPU utilization (or other signals).</li>
  <li>Limiting concurrency with a semaphore (and an excellent analogy about toilets).</li>
</ul>

<p>Happy paralleling!</p>

The Fortune 100 have a use case for these companies, the rest are overpaying.</h2><div><a rel="noopener follow" href="https://kjhealey.medium.com/?source=post_page-----5ebda64c0853--------------------------------"><div aria-hidden="false"><p><img alt="Kieran Healey" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*isjUJeU0W_8rw-ANvMGhtQ@2x.jpeg" width="44" height="44" loading="lazy" data-testid="authorPhoto"></p></div></a></div></div><figure><figcaption>A Recession is coming are you ready to explain your expensive bills to your CEO? AI generated image from craiyon.com</figcaption></figure><p id="fe84">I have been working in Data Engineering for about 8 years now. When I started, I caught the tail end of the Hadoop era. I got my start on a technology known then as MapR at a boutique Energy Firm in Houston, Texas. This was a period of personal growth and learning. From Python, Spark, Scala, Docker, Airflow and how to check in code to Gitlab. It was an exciting time. As a junior developer you are more fascinated by what you can do with a language rather than what you can solve. This is the way.</p><figure><figcaption>shamelessly stolen from tenor.com</figcaption></figure><p id="cbd3">As I progressed in my career, became some-what wiser (debatable), more business oriented (less debatable), and apathetic with the technology I was using, I realized that most companies overspent and under deliver on their data projects. But why? It seems like there are tons of companies who are buying into the marketing hype surrounding the two major Data Platform as a Service offerings: Databricks and Snowflake. My Cached Take for the week: <strong>80% of companies do not need what these companies are offering for the price they are paying</strong>. The global economy is headed for a recession. That’s not my opinion, that’s the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/15/1170246247/federal-reserve-forecasters-warn-of-a-possible-recession-later-this-year" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Federal Reserve’s</a>. So in a time where most companies should be cutting back, how and where should you cut?</p></div><div><p id="d836">Both of these platforms are charging their customers for Ferraris, when most companies would be happy with a Toyata Camry with some After Market parts. Don’t get me wrong, both platforms are doing impressive things; Snowflake’s Data Cloud is really coming to life with their partnership with NVIDIA and Databricks is putting runs on the board with the Spark Human API. These are not reasons you should use their platforms. These are marketing gimmicks to garner the attention of the decision makers to loosen the company purse strings. This is a fundamental mistake in the way businesses operate. Pay to make a problem disappear. We operate as if these platforms solve problems, when fundamentally they do not and often exacerbate large inefficiencies that already exist within an organization. If you want to make a big impact be Anti-Hype.</p></div><div><p id="4652">Alright, so how do you become Anti-Hype, you ask? Trust in people. People solve problems; thus, we should encourage businesses to get to the core of their data problems first before they start to spend $$$. Here is a list of things you can do to as a cost conscious, Anti-Hype data person.</p><h2 id="9292">1. Sit down with your customer and be their Data Advocate</h2><p id="639e">This is probably the hardest thing to do, because ultimately, your business wants <strong>“The Art of the Possible”</strong>. What a way to pass any and all responsibility to the engineer while maintaining none of the responsibility of defining your product. It’s a great reminder that despite all of the hype around data, people do not know what they want. This is a huge red flag in any project I commit to because it shows an immaturity and lack of understanding of how the customer wishes to translate data into business value. The most important thing about being Anti-Hype is truly understanding customer desire and translating that into an apporpriate and measured response. Questions I would ask to engage the customer are: How do you see yourself using the data? Are you going to passively look at the data daily, or are you going to require some functionality to send data to another vendor? What is the frequency of the Data? What is the volume? Any engineer can code, a great Anti-Hype engineer asks questions until they hear “I do not know”. Once this is said, then you can draw on your experience and expertise to help design and architect a solution that meets their needs.</p><h2 id="684a">2. Do the boring stuff: Make a Data Model</h2><p id="8284">This art has been lost amidst the Data Hype Train. Most people are focused on going as fast as possible without realizing the architectural hole they might be burying their careers under. Modern Data Stack is great at producing velocity, but if you are fast at doing things wrong it might spell doom if your other systems rely on the Modern Data Stack to finish performing analysis on very wide and long tables. Think about your architecture, decide on a data architecture for your Data Warehouse (Kimball, Inmon, etc) and a visualization layer (Snowflake Schema, Star Schema, Galaxy Schema). If you are doing data lake, define the columns you want to partition on, colocate columns that you would filter on. Define when you should compact files, when to Z-order. If Data needs to move bidirectionally decide on how data updates on load in both directions. Talk with your stakeholders. Ask the question how they want to see the data, colocate the fields they want to see together, push the data fields they don’t want to see to other tables. If you can sniff out the inefficiencies in your Data early and make architecture that handles your specific data, you often find you do not need the power that a Snowflake or Databricks has to offer. Do the real work. Work with people. The Code will write itself. I promise.</p><h2 id="a98b">3. Accept and adopt Open Source technologies that can replace Expensive SaaS Solutions.</h2><p id="fa58">If you are looking to replicate the core functionality of Snowflake for your Analytics Platform, look no further than <a href="https://duckdb.org/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">DuckDB</a>. It can run on FS-like systems (s3, Azure Blob, etc) and Databases. I have been using the <a href="https://duckdb.org/2022/09/30/postgres-scanner.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Postgres duck-db</a> extension to much success and could see it replacing the separation of Storage and Compute that Snowflake offers. Keeping a pulse on these technologies can help improve your bottom line, while this does not include all of the security features that come out of the box in both Snowflake and Databricks, a talk with your local Dev Ops Engineer/ manager to discuss how to secure your implementations. As always, the human element of your job is the most important step. By interacting, exploring, and translating technologies from Hype to business value, you can help save money while maintaining nearly the same level of core functionality as a Databricks and/or Snowflake.</p></div><div><figure></figure><p id="9d88"><em>That’s all for now! I hope you all have learned to be a little more Anti-Hype. </em><strong><em>Kieran Healey</em></strong><em> is a doer at heart, a video game coder at night, a DnD cultist on Sundays, and a lover of technology.

Alas, the time comes in every man’s life when he must hang up his hat and retire to his home in the Bahamas. As my swan song, I have thrown together, as requested, a few thoughts on how to handle my kind. I hope you find the attached 120-page PowerPoint presentation useful. Below you will find a brief summary.</p><p><b>Be ready for the “bait and switch”: </b>Do not be fooled by the eloquent veterans who will turn up to your office to plead for your business. The work will mostly be done by clever but pimply 20-somethings, armed with two-by-two matrix frameworks recycled from client to client. What they lack in wisdom will be made up for in long hours. You need not feel sorry for them. They are cocooned in a shell of fancy meals, lavish hotels and private drivers—at your expense. </p><p>At first you will find them to be of no use at all—detrimental, even—as they harry your management team with endless questions and urgent requests for data. Eventually, they will win you over with their brains and gumption—or be quietly replaced. Meanwhile, those grey-haired senior partners will pop by from time to time. Beware.</p><p><b>Watch out for “land and expand”: </b>We consultants are masters of the clandestine sale. If you hire us for a two-month project, it will assuredly take 12. By the time it ends, our tentacles will have spread. Ask for a new company strategy, blink, and we will be cutting your costs, fixing your <small>IT </small>systems and tinkering with your supply chain.</p><p>Like many other bosses, you may one day tire of our eye-watering rates and decide to poach the cleverest consultants for yourself. We will happily oblige. The most reliable missionary for the merits of consulting is one of our own. The more senior, the better. Hire them, but do not give them the cheque book.</p><p><b>Question everything: </b>Every self-respecting consultant knows that big recommendations demand big numbers. As a rule, divide everything you see by two. Never trust a benchmark; I made up most of mine. And carefully read those endless notes at the bottom of charts. That is often where the dirtiest secrets are buried. Be doubly dubious of any consulting reports your underlings happen to commission, especially when they recommend a bigger budget for said underling.</p><p><b>Take none of the blame: </b>As a freshly minted chief executive, you are undoubtedly brimming with ideas. Many of them are terrible. Some may prove catastrophic. Among the valuable services offered by management consultants is the human shield. Make sure your board knows it was they who recommended the disastrous new product line or the overpriced acquisition. You always had your doubts, but trusted their illustrious reputations. Equally, your consultants may, from time to time, stumble upon a good idea. You thought of it first.</p><p><b>Experiment with polygamy: </b>Your consultants will do their utmost to woo you into exclusivity. There will be much talk of “long-term partnership”. Yet it is a one-sided monogamy they seek. Fidelity is not in a consultant’s nature. Chances are they are already advising your competitors, with only the thinnest of Chinese walls between teams.</p><p>Follow their example and hire their rivals, too. Ideally, sit them in adjacent rooms at your offices. Consultants are fiercely competitive, and nothing will better spur them on to even longer reports than seeing their nemeses wandering the halls of your company. If bored, invite representatives of two warring firms to a meeting and watch them tussle for your favour.</p><p>As I look back on my career, I am not too proud to admit that I have occasionally fleeced the odd firm. But I maintain that my profession is a noble one. “Impact”, after all, is our industry’s watchword. (Admittedly, I never was quite clear what it meant, but you cannot deny it sounds lofty.)</p><p>One final thought to conclude: there is never a problem too big or small for a consultant. That I can confirm from experience. Your bill, including expenses, is attached. Good luck. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p><b>Read more from Bartleby, our columnist on management and work:</b><br><i><a

<p><span>Opinion</span> Information wants to be free. This usefully ambiguous battle cry has been the mischievous slogan of hackers since early networking thinker Stuart Brand coined it in the early 1980s. Intended as part of a discussion about the inherent contradictions of intellectual property, it has bestowed irony in many other places since.</p>
<p>Veilid would seem to be one such place. The open source project has <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/12/veilid_privacy_data/">recently announced</a> a secure communications framework, designed for decentralized peer-to-peer use through a multi-hop mesh routing system that combines strong encryption with untraceability. In particular, it is designed to be included in any app that wants to have impervious comms without central servers or third-party visibility. This is new, at least as far as its functionality is not tied to narrow use cases, and important. You never, ever want to roll your own networks, cryptographic systems or security management: now you don't have to.</p>
<p>The irony comes from Veilid's origins, the legendary <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2008/01/25/ddos_scientology_controversy/">Cult of the Dead Cow</a> hacker collective. Like Tor before it, where the US Navy intelligence agency gave us an intelligence agency resistant network, Veilid isn't so much poacher turned gamekeeper as the creation of a mirror world. Information may want to be free, but it also wants to be free from interlopers and snoopers. If Veilid achieves its aims of a massive global network of mesh nodes, it will gain that freedom by becoming far too expensive to break.</p>

    

<p>This is particularly timely, as it is not just another nail in the coffin of state efforts to defeat personal secure encryption by diktat, but a permanent mausoleum as monumental&nbsp;as the Pyramids of Giza.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Backdoor backwardness</h3>
<p>The official madness over data security is particularly bad in the UK. The British state is a world class incompetent at protecting its own data. In the past couple of weeks alone, we have seen the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/11/electoral_commission_vulnerability/">hacking of the Electoral Commission</a>, the state body in charge of elections, the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-66523032" rel="nofollow">mass exposure</a> of birth, marriage and death data, and the bulk release of confidential personnel information of a number of police forces, most notably <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/17/man_arrested_in_ni_police/">the Police Service Northern Ireland</a>. This was immediately picked up by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/7b29e72c-bcba-44a5-abb0-c9a57d35cb9c">terrorists</a> who like killing police. It doesn't get worse than that.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/12/veilid_privacy_data/">Veilid: A secure peer-to-peer network for apps that flips off the surveillance economy</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/16/openzfs_zfsbootmenu_2_2/">OpenZFS 2.2 is nearly here, and ZFSBootMenu 2.2 already is</a></li>

</ul>
<p>This same state is, of course, the one demanding that to "protect children," it should get access to whatever encrypted citizen communication it likes via the Online Safety Bill, which is now rumored to be going through British Parliament in October. This is akin to giving an alcoholic uncle the keys to every booze shop in town to "protect children": you will find Uncle in a drunken coma with the doors wide open and the stock disappearing by the vanload.</p>
<p>That assumes the best case scenario, where the deliberately weakened encryption needed for state access somehow resists attack by others. In practice, as those who <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/29/apple_online_safety_bill_opposition/">actually understand encryption</a> have said at endless length, it is impossible to guarantee or even expect this. Companies which don't deliberately compromise user security will be fined – hence Signal, WhatsApp and others have said they'd leave the UK rather than comply. In practice, this will mean geo-locking their apps in the App Store and Google Play to prevent installation to UK devices, a move that will hurt ordinary people but which is absolutely no barrier to anyone with motivation. Like criminals.</p>

        


        

<p>It is just stupidity stacked on incompetence balanced on political Dunning Krugerism, and the advent of Veilid drowns the lot in a tidal wave of foetid futility. What can a government do about a framework? What can it do about open source? The idea behind Veilid is to add end-to-end, peer-to-peer encrypted functionality to any app that can use it, which by itself is a force multiplier for privacy. The intent is for developers to integrate the framework as any other, as a seamless part of their products. As it stands, if the Online Safety Bill becomes law, then developers who do this will be excluded from UK commercial activity.</p>
<p>Software doesn't have to work like that, as users of open source audio and video tools already know. Codecs can come encumbered with patent and licence fees that exclude them from shipping with FOSS products. Make them external, optional libraries, and the FOSS product can ship and user install the libraries themselves. Those libraries aren't functional products until that point, which makes them trickier to attack legally.</p>
<h3>Smack 'em in the supply chain</h3>
<p>It is entirely possible to see not just Veilid but other end-to-end encryption systems taking this approach, a UK-only product that complies with the Snooper's Charter but which has the potential to pick up protection from another block of software, which doesn't itself need the ability to communicate with anything. It's not ideal, and opens up the potential for supply chain attacks and user confusion, but these are fixable with a bit of thought and care. Unlike the state strategy which promoted this little bit of evolution.</p>
<p>The only way to outlaw encryption is to outlaw encryption. Anything less will fail, as it is always possible in software to create kits of parts, all legal by themselves, that can be linked together to provide encryption with no single entity to legislate against. Our industry is fully aware of this. Criminals know it too. Ordinary people will learn it as well, if they have to. This information is free to everyone – except the politicians, it seems. For them, reality is far too expensive. ®</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>We spend huge amounts of time sweating the details of our&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thinkst.com/" target="_blank">products</a>. We want to remove all the friction we can from using them and want to make sure we never leave our users confused. To get this right, we do a bunch of things: we use simple language, we make extensive use of context-sensitive help and where it’s needed, we nudge users with illustrative examples.</p>



<p>Recently we bumped into something that made us rethink our use of examples.</p>



<h2>Background</h2>



<p>Paid Canary customers also receive a private Canarytokens server as part of their subscription. This is a private, managed version of the service publicly available at&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.canarytokens.org/" target="_blank">www.canarytokens.org</a>. They get to mint an unlimited number of Canarytokens, get access to some tokens before they are released to the world and are able to trivially customise the service.</p>



<p>Canarytokens typically (but not always) rely on a DNS zone that’s unique per-customer. When a customer signs up, we create a DNS zone for them and usually that’s sufficient for their needs.</p>



<p>However, one of the advanced customisations for customers is the ability to create their own DNS zone with a name they pick. They’d typically do this to make the underlying hostname obviously tied to their company, so their custom DNS zone might look like  <code>assets.their-company.com</code>. This requires users to pick a zone name, and as a UX guide we autogenerated a name for them. We happily used&nbsp;<code>someprefix.their-company.com</code><sup>2</sup><sup data-fn="a2d01372-26bc-4218-8b7a-3d2b0445e9a0"><a href="#a2d01372-26bc-4218-8b7a-3d2b0445e9a0" id="a2d01372-26bc-4218-8b7a-3d2b0445e9a0-link">1</a></sup>, as an example:</p>

<p>When we built the UI for this feature, the inclusion of the <code>someprefix</code> example was to make it easier for customer to configure DNS on their end, given that DNS can be tricky to get right. It wasn’t the intention that customer <em>only</em> use a zone called <code>someprefix</code>, we simply picked it because we needed <em>something</em> to use in our examples. If the example zone name becomes an implicit standard then the risk is that it lets attackers more confidently guess about Canarytokens based on discovered hostnames.</p>



<p>Recently, one of our engineers was working in this area of code and wondered how many customers simply followed the example shown and picked <code>someprefix.their-company.com</code>&nbsp;as their custom domain of choice, as opposed to choosing another. His intuition was spot on. Among customers using this feature, ~40% used the example we provided:</p>

<p>We use the custom domain to make Canarytokens less identifiable. If 40% of them use the same custom name, then the disguise is not as effective.</p>



<h2>Learning</h2>



<p>To be sure, this is not an individual customer problem. Looking at other configuration options present in our UI, the pattern is clear. When given an example, a significant number of users default to using that same example in their customisation. The behaviour is consistent across customers and configurations. This surprised us! <sup data-fn="2edb2cf0-2747-4fb9-9bfe-e692050a1185"><a href="#2edb2cf0-2747-4fb9-9bfe-e692050a1185" id="2edb2cf0-2747-4fb9-9bfe-e692050a1185-link">2</a></sup></p>



<p>It’s important to realise this isn’t a customer-side issue; they shouldn’t have to consider the impact of every configuration option we choose to put in front of them. They don’t have the full context and knowledge, and expecting them to be experts in the nitty gritty of Canarytoken discoverability makes no sense. Frankly it’s a reason enterprise software is often so terrible; tons of options you barely understand or know about, and are configured according to tutorials/examples rather than understanding. This is a lesson for us internally about how we guide customers through using Canarytokens, and more generally through Canary.</p>



<p>Fortunately this particular case has a simple enough fix. Going forward, we will show multiple examples of prefixes. A user looking to add a custom domain will see a variety of example zones when they visit the page, and the examples will cycle each time they open the configuration page. We want to convey that they have options in choosing the name, and we show them a variety of sample options. Our hope is that this will prompt customers to pick their own names, and if they <em>do</em> rely on our examples then those are now spread over a large list of examples.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>The outsized impact what seemed like a very minor placeholder choice made years ago helped us reevaluate how we select the examples we show customers. It’s a strong reminder about sweating every small detail in the UI; we were surprised at the oversized effect of our examples.</p>



<p>Going forward this particular placeholder has been altered and is already live for customers. We will report back with a count with the new active examples in the future.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>(well, not exactly <em>everywhere</em> …)</p>

<p>This is not an easy post for me to write, being a bit of a criticism / “you can do better” note for organisers of conferences that cater to a global community.</p>

<p>It’s not easy because most of the conferences I attend are community driven, and I have helped organise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSS.IN">community conferences</a> in the past. It is a thankless job, a labour of love, and you mostly do not get to enjoy the fruits of that labour as others do.</p>

<p>The problem is that these conferences end up inadvertently excluding members who live in, for lack of a better phrase, the Global South.</p>

<h2>Visas</h2>

<p>It always surprises me when I meet someone who doesn’t realise that I can’t just book tickets to go anywhere in the world. Not because this is information that everyone <em>should</em> be aware of, but because this is such a basic aspect of travel for someone like me. As a holder of an Indian passport, I need to apply for a visa to travel to … well <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_Indian_citizens">most countries</a>.</p>

<p>The list of countries that require a visa are clearly defined by post-colonial geopolitics, this is just a fact of life and not something I can do very much about.</p>

<h2>Getting a Visa</h2>

<p>Applying for a visa is a cumbersome and intrusive process that I am now used to. The process varies from country to country, but it’s usually something like:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Get an invitation letter from conference organisers</li>
    <li>Book all the tickets and accommodation for the trip</li>
    <li>Provide bank statements for 3-6 months, income tax returns for ~3 years (in India, those statements need attestation by the bank)</li>
    <li>Maybe provide travel and employment history for the past few years (how many years depends on the country)</li>
    <li>Get an appointment from the embassy of the country you’re traveling to (or their service provider)</li>
    <li>Submit your passport and application</li>
    <li>Maybe provide documentation that was not listed on the provider’s website</li>
    <li>Wait for your passport with visa (if granted) to be mailed back to you</li>
</ul>

<p>The duration of visa (that is how long you can stay in the country) depends on the country.</p>

<p>In the EU, I am usually granted a visa for the exact dates of travel (so there is no flexibility to change plans). The UK allows you to pay more for a longer visa.</p>

<p>The US and Canada grant multi-year visas that allow one to visit for up to 6 months by default (in the US, whether you are permitted to enter and how long you may stay are determined by the person at the border).</p>

<h2>Timelines</h2>

<p>Now we get to the crux of the problem: this process can take anywhere from a few days (if you are <em>very</em> lucky) to a few months (if you are not).</p>

<p>Appointments are granted by the embassy or the third party that countries delegate application collection to, and these may or may not be easily available. Post-pandemic, I’ve seen that several embassies just aren’t accepting visitor visa appointments or have a multi-month wait.</p>

<p>If you do get an appointment, the processing time can vary again. Sometimes, it’s a matter of a few days, sometimes a few weeks. A lot of countries I have applied to recommend submitting your application at least 6 weeks in advance (this is from the date of your visa appointment which might be several weeks in the future).</p>

<h2>Conference Schedules</h2>

<p>If you’re organising a conference, there are a few important dates:</p>

<ul>
    <li>When the conference dates are announced</li>
    <li>When the call for participation goes out</li>
    <li>When it ends</li>
    <li>When speakers are notified</li>
    <li>The conference itself</li>
</ul>

<p>These dates are based on a set of complex factors — venue availability and confirmation, literally writing and publishing all the content of the website, paper committee availability, etc.</p>

<p>But if you’re in my position, you need <em>at least</em> 2-3 months between the first and the last step. If your attendance is conditional on speaking at the conference (for example, if your company will only sponsor you if you’re speaking), then you need a minimum of 2-3 months between when speakers are notified and the conference starts.</p>

<p>From what I see, this is not something that is top-of-mind for conference organisers. That may happen for a host of perfectly understandable reasons, but it also has a cost to the community and individuals who might want to participate.</p>

<h2>Other Costs</h2>

<p>Applying for a visa costs money. This can be anything from a few hundred to over a 1000 US dollars.</p>

<p>It also costs you time — filling in the application, getting all the documentation in place, getting a physical visa photo (must be no older than 6 months), traveling to an appointment, waiting in line, etc. This can easily be a matter of a day if not more.</p>

<p>Finally, there is an <em>emotional</em> cost to all this — there is constant uncertainty during the process, and a visa rejection means <em>every</em> visa you apply for thereafter needs you to document that rejection and reason. And you may find out just days before your planned travel whether you get to travel or not.</p>

<h2>What Can One Do?</h2>

<p>All of this clearly sucks, but the problem of visas is too big and messy for any of us to have any real impact on, at least in the short term. But if you’re organising a conference, and you want a diverse audience, here are a few things you <em>can</em> do:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Announce the dates of the conference as early as possible (allows participants to book travel, visa appointments, maybe club multiple conferences)</li>
    <li>Provide invitation letters in a timely manner</li>
    <li>Call for participation as early as possible</li>
    <li>Notify speakers as soon as you can</li>
</ul>

<p>I know of conferences that <em>do</em> some if not all of these things — you know who you are and you have my gratitude for it.</p>

<p>If you made it this far, thank you for reading.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/temporarily-abled/">https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/temporarily-abled/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37205731">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          <p>That’s a quote from Cindy Li — “We're all just temporarily abled”. I first heard it in <a href="https://practical-accessibility.today/">Sarah’s course</a> and it’s been on repeat in my mind ever since June 6th.</p>
<p>June 6th I was on vacation at the beach with my family and tried something that, looking back now, maybe I’m too old for. And I injured my knee.</p>
<p>I knew immediately it was bad.</p>
<p>I laid there in the sand, unable to get up, and let the surf crash over me. After a few waves, I got on my belly dragged myself free.</p>
<p>Fortunately this all happened the day before we flew home, but sitting there on the beach at sunset I knew my vacation was over at that point.</p>
<p>That was almost three months ago now. I’m still limping. It’s getting better but it’s slow. The doctor told me, “Just be aware: this isn’t days or weeks recovery. This is months.”</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve tried to make the best of summer while kids are out of school but my mobility has been limited. </p>
<p>Through all of it, I’ve found myself noticing “accessibility” helpers more than ever before: that railing on the stairs, that ramp off to the side of the building, that elevator tucked away in the back.</p>
<p>All things I rarely noticed before but have since become vital.</p>
<p>And that phrase plays on repeat in my head — “we’re all just temporarily abled”. From <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/practical-accessibility/">my notes on Sarah’s course</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 in 5 people currently have a disability. 100% of people will have some form of disability in their lifetime. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suppose it’s easy to misunderstand ability as a binary thing. But now I’m understanding more how fluid it is, as it inevitably comes in and out of each of our lives — “100% of people” in their lifetimes.</p>
<p>In classic human fashion, it’s one of those things you take for granted until it's gone.</p>
<p>(I’m taking a moment for self-reflection here.)</p>
<p>I know I’m privileged. My knee is healing each day, and fortunately all I have to do is sit at a desk for work.</p>
<p>I am more grateful now for the abilities I have, for the accessible helpers in the world I overlooked before, and for the people who make them possible.</p>
