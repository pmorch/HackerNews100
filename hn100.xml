<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A month’s supply of Miebo, Bausch &amp; Lomb’s prescription dry eye drug, costs $800 or more in the U.S. before insurance. But the same drug — sold as <a href="https://ois.net/novaliq-transforming-tears/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EvoTears</a> — has been available over-the-counter (OTC) in Europe since 2015 for about $20. I ordered it online from an overseas pharmacy for $32 including shipping, and it was delivered in a week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is, of course, both shocking and unsurprising. A 2021 RAND <a href="https://www.rand.org/news/press/2021/01/28.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> found U.S. prescription drug prices are, on average, more than 2.5 times higher than in 32 other developed nations. Miebo exemplifies how some pharmaceutical companies exploit regulatory loopholes and patent protections, prioritizing profits over patients, eroding trust in health care. But there is a way to fix this loophole.</p>



<p>In December 2019, Bausch &amp; Lomb, formerly a division of Valeant, acquired the exclusive license for the commercialization and development in&nbsp;the United States&nbsp;and&nbsp;Canada&nbsp;for NOV03, now called Miebo in the U.S. Rather than getting an approval for an OTC drug, like it is in Europe, Bausch secured U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval as a prescription medication, subsequently pricing it at a high level. Currently, according to GoodRx, a monthly supply of Miebo will cost $830.27 at Walgreens, and it’s listed at $818.38 on <a href="https://pharmacy.amazon.com/dp/B0CJV1CC69" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Pharmacy</a>.</p>



<p>The strategy has paid off: Miebo’s 2024 sales — its first full year — hit <a href="https://ir.bausch.com/sites/bauschhealth-ir/files/2025-02/4q24-bausch-lomb-earnings-presentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$172 million</a>, surpassing the company’s projections of $95 million. The company now forecasts sales to exceed <a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/bausch-lomb-taps-broadcaster-erin-andrews-push-fast-growing-dry-eye-disease-drug" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$500 million annually</a>. At European prices, those sales would be less than $20 million. Emboldened with Miebo’s early success, Bausch &amp; Lomb raised the price another 4% in 2025, according to the drug price tracking firm 46brooklyn.</p>



<p>Bausch &amp; Lomb has a track record of prioritizing profits over patients. As Valeant, its business model was simple: buy, gut, gouge, repeat. In 2015, it raised prices for Nitropress and Isuprel by over <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pharmaceutical-companies-buy-rivals-drugs-then-jack-up-the-prices-1430096431?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">200% and 500%</a>, respectively, triggering a 2016 congressional hearing. Despite promises of reform, little has changed. When he was at Allergan, Bausch &amp; Lomb’s current CEO, Brent Saunders, pledged “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/allergans-social-contract-protect-medical-innovation-from-goldberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responsible pricing</a>” but tried to extend patent protection for Allergan’s drug Restasis (another dry eye drug) through a <a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2018/07/20/allergan-mohawk-patent-restasis/">dubious deal with the Mohawk Indian tribe</a>, later rejected by courts.</p>





<p>Now at Bausch &amp; Lomb, Saunders oversaw Miebo’s launch, claiming earlier this year in an investor call, “We are once again an innovation company.” But finding a way to get an existing European OTC drug to be a prescription drug in the U.S. with a new name and a 40-fold price increase is not true innovation — it’s a price-gouging strategy.</p>



<p>Bausch &amp; Lomb could have pursued OTC approval in the U.S., leveraging its expertise in OTC eye drops and lotions. However, I could not find in transcripts or presentations any evidence that Baush &amp; Lomb seriously pursued this. Prescription status, however, ensures much higher prices, protected by patents and limited competition. Even insured patients feel the ripple effects: Coupons may reduce out-of-pocket costs, but insurers pay hundreds per prescription, driving up premiums and the overall cost of health care for everyone.</p>



<p>In response to questions from STAT about why Miebo is an expensive prescription drug, a representative said in a statement, “The FDA determined that MIEBO acts at the cellular and molecular level of the eye, which meant it had to go through the same rigorous process as any new pharmaceutical — a full New Drug Application. Unlike in Europe, where all medical device eye drops are prescription-free and cleared through a highly predictable and fast pathway, we were required to design, enroll and complete extensive clinical trials involving thousands of patients, and provide detailed safety and efficacy data submissions. Those studies took years and significant investment, but they ensure that MIEBO meets the highest regulatory standards for safety and effectiveness.”</p>



<p>Bausch &amp; Lomb’s carefully worded response expertly sidesteps the real issue. The FDA’s test for OTC status isn’t a drug’s mechanism of action — it’s whether patients can use it safely without a doctor. Miebo’s track record as an OTC product in Europe for nearly a decade shows it meets that standard. Bausch &amp; Lomb provides no evidence, or even assertion, that it ever tried for OTC approval in the U.S. Instead, it pursued the prescription route — not because of regulatory necessity, but as a business strategy to secure patents and command an $800 price. In doing so, B&amp;L is weaponizing a regulatory loophole against American patients, prioritizing profit over access, and leaving their “significant investment” as the cost of monopoly, not medical necessity.</p>



<p>Even if you accept Bausch &amp; Lomb’s self-serving rationale, the answer is not to allow the loophole to persist, but to close it.&nbsp;The FDA could require any drug approved as OTC internationally be considered for OTC status in the United States before greenlighting it as a prescription product — and mandate retroactive review of cases like Miebo.</p>





<p>The FDA’s OTC monograph process, which assesses the safety and efficacy of nonprescription drugs, makes this feasible, though it may need to be adjusted slightly. Those changes might involve incorporating a mechanism to make sure that overseas OTC status triggers a review of U.S. prescription drugs containing the same active ingredients or formulations for potential OTC designation; developing criteria to assess equivalency in safety and efficacy standards between U.S. OTC requirements and those of other countries; and establishing a retroactive review pathway within the monograph process to handle existing prescription drugs already marketed OTC internationally.</p>



<p>EvoTears thrives abroad without safety concerns, countering industry claims of stricter U.S. standards. This reform would deter companies from repackaging OTC drugs as high-cost prescriptions, fostering competition and lowering prices.</p>



<p>While this tactic isn’t widespread, it joins loopholes like late-listed patents, picket fence patents, or pay-for-delay generic deals that undermine trust in an industry whose employees largely aim to save lives.</p>



<p>Miebo also shows how global reference pricing could save billions. Aligning with European prices could cut consumer costs while reducing doctor visits, pharmacy time, and administrative burdens. For patients who skip doses to afford groceries, lower prices would mean better access and health. Reforms like the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act’s Medicare price negotiations set a precedent, but targeted rules are urgently needed.</p>



<p>Unexplained differences in drug prices between the U.S. and other wealthy countries erode the public’s trust in health care. Companies like Bausch &amp; Lomb exploit systemic gaps, leaving patients and payers to foot exorbitant bills. An OTC evaluation rule, with retroactive reviews, is a practical first step, signaling that patient access takes precedence over corporate greed.</p>



<p>Let’s end the price-gouging practices of outliers and build a health care system that puts patients first. Just as targeting criminal outliers fosters a law-abiding society, holding bad pharmaceutical actors accountable is crucial for restoring trust and integrity to our health care system. While broader approaches to making health care more fair, accessible, and affordable are needed, sometimes the way to save billions is to start by saving hundreds of millions.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lightpanda.io/blog/posts/why-we-built-lightpanda-in-zig">https://lightpanda.io/blog/posts/why-we-built-lightpanda-in-zig</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46165249">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Because We're Not Smart Enough for C++ or Rust</p><div><p><img src="https://cdn.lightpanda.io/website/assets/images/blog/authors/francis-bouvier.jpg" alt="Francis Bouvier"></p><div><h3>Francis Bouvier</h3><h4>Cofounder &amp; CEO</h4></div></div><figure><img src="https://cdn.lightpanda.io/website/assets/images/blog/posts/why-we-built-lightpanda-in-zig/zigligihtpandalarge.png" alt="Why We Built Lightpanda in Zig"></figure><h2 id="tldr">TL;DR<a href="#tldr" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>To be honest, when I began working on Lightpanda, I chose Zig because I’m not smart enough to build a big project in C++ or Rust.</p>
<p>I like simple languages. I like Zig for the same reasons I like Go, C, and the KISS principle. Not just because I believe in this philosophy, but because I’m not capable of handling complicated abstractions at scale.</p>
<p>Before Lightpanda, I was doing a lot of Go. But building a web browser from scratch requires a low-level systems programming language to ensure great performance, so Go wasn’t an option. And for a project like this, I wanted more safety and modern tooling than C.</p>
<h2 id="why-we-built-lightpanda-in-zig">Why We Built Lightpanda in Zig<a href="#why-we-built-lightpanda-in-zig" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Our requirements were performance, simplicity, and modern tooling. Zig seemed like the perfect balance: simpler than C++ and Rust, top-tier performance, and better tooling and safety than C.</p>
<p>As we built the first iterations of the browser and dug deeper into the language, we came to appreciate features where Zig particularly shines: comptime metaprogramming, explicit memory allocators, and best-in-class C interoperability. Not to mention the ongoing work on compilation times.</p>
<p>Of course it’s a big bet. Zig is a relatively new language with a small ecosystem. It’s pre-1.0 with regular breaking changes. But we’re very bullish on this language, and we’re not the only ones: <a href="https://ghostty.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ghostty<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>, <a href="https://bun.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bun<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>, <a href="https://tigerbeetle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TigerBeetle<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>, and <a href="https://zml.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ZML<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a> are all building with Zig.

<h2 id="what-lightpanda-needs-from-a-language">What Lightpanda Needs from a Language<a href="#what-lightpanda-needs-from-a-language" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Before diving into specifics, let’s talk about what building a browser for web automation requires.</p>
<p>First, we needed a JavaScript engine. Without one, a browser only sees static HTML: no client-side rendering and no dynamic content. We chose V8, Chrome’s JavaScript engine, because it’s state of the art, widely used (<a href="https://nodejs.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Node.js<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>, <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Deno<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>), and relatively easy to embed.</p>
<p>V8 is written in C++, and doesn’t have a C API, which means any language integrating with it must handle C++ boundaries. Zig doesn’t interoperate directly with C++, but it has first-class C interop, and C remains the lingua franca of systems programming. We use C headers generated primarily from <a href="https://github.com/denoland/rusty_v8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">rusty_v8<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>, part of the <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Deno project<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>, to bridge between V8’s C++ API and our Zig code.</p>
<p>Beyond integration, performance and memory control were essential. When you’re crawling thousands of pages or running automation at scale, every millisecond counts. We also needed precise control over short-lived allocations like DOM trees, JavaScript objects, and parsing buffers. Zig’s explicit allocator model fits that need perfectly.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-c">Why Not C++?<a href="#why-not-c" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>C++ was the obvious option: it powers virtually every major browser engine. But here’s what gave us pause.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Four decades of features</strong>: C++ has accumulated enormous complexity over the years. There are multiple ways to do almost everything: template metaprogramming, multiple inheritance patterns, various initialization syntaxes. We wanted a language with one clear way to do things.</li>
<li><strong>Memory management</strong>: Control comes with constant vigilance. Use-after-free bugs, memory leaks, and dangling pointers are real risks. Smart pointers help, but they add complexity and runtime overhead. Zig’s approach of passing allocators explicitly makes memory management clearer and enables patterns like arenas more naturally.</li>
<li><strong>Build systems</strong>: Anyone who’s fought with CMake or dealt with header file dependencies knows this pain. For a small team trying to move quickly, we didn’t want to waste time debugging build configuration issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re not saying C++ is bad. It powers incredible software. But for a small team starting from scratch, we wanted something simpler.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-rust">Why not Rust?<a href="#why-not-rust" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Many people ask this next. It’s a fair challenge. Rust is a more mature language than Zig, offers memory safety guarantees, has excellent tooling, and a growing ecosystem.</p>
<p>Rust would have been a viable choice. But for Lightpanda’s specific needs (and honestly, for our team’s experience level) it introduced friction we didn’t want.</p>
<h3 id="the-unsafe-rust-problem">The Unsafe Rust Problem<a href="#the-unsafe-rust-problem" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>When you need to do things the borrow checker doesn’t like, you end up writing unsafe Rust, which is surprisingly hard. <a href="https://zackoverflow.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Zack<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a> from <a href="https://bun.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bun<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a> explores this in depth in his article <a href="https://zackoverflow.dev/writing/unsafe-rust-vs-zig/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">When Zig is safer and faster than Rust<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>.</p>
<p>Browser engines and garbage-collected runtimes are classic examples of code that fights the borrow checker. You’re constantly juggling different memory regions: per-page arenas, shared caches, temporary buffers, objects with complex interdependencies. These patterns don’t map cleanly to Rust’s ownership model. You end up either paying performance costs (using indices instead of pointers, unnecessary clones) or diving into unsafe code where raw pointer ergonomics are poor and Miri becomes your constant companion.</p>
<p>Zig takes a different approach. Rather than trying to enforce safety through the type system and then providing an escape hatch, Zig is designed for scenarios where you’re doing memory-unsafe things. It gives you tools to make that experience better: non-null pointers by default, the GeneralPurposeAllocator that catches use-after-free bugs in debug mode, and pointer types with good ergonomics.</p>
<h2 id="why-zig-works-for-lightpanda">Why Zig Works for Lightpanda<a href="#why-zig-works-for-lightpanda" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Zig sits in an interesting space. It’s a simple language that’s easy to learn, where everything is explicit: no hidden control flow, no hidden allocations.</p>
<h3 id="explicit-memory-management-with-allocators">Explicit Memory Management with Allocators<a href="#explicit-memory-management-with-allocators" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Zig makes you choose how memory is managed through allocators. Every allocation requires you to specify which allocator to use. This might sound tedious at first, but it gives you precise control.</p>
<p>Here’s what this looks like in practice, using an arena allocator:</p>

<p>This pattern matches browser workloads perfectly. Each page load gets its own arena. When the page is done, we throw away the entire memory chunk. No tracking individual allocations, no reference counting overhead, no garbage collection pauses. (Though we’re learning that single pages can grow large in memory, so we’re also exploring mid-lifecycle cleanup strategies). And you can chain arenas, to create short-lived objects inside a page lifecycle.</p>
<h3 id="compile-time-metaprogramming">Compile-Time Metaprogramming<a href="#compile-time-metaprogramming" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Zig’s comptime feature lets you write code that runs during compilation. We use this extensively to reduce boilerplate when bridging Zig and JavaScript.</p>
<p>When integrating V8, you need to expose native types to JavaScript. In most languages, this requires glue code for each type. To generate this glue you need some code generation, usually through Macros (Rust, C, C++). Macros are a completely different language, which has a lot of downsides. Zig’s comptime lets us automate this:</p>

<p>The registerType function uses comptime reflection to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find all public methods on Point</li>
<li>Generate JavaScript wrapper functions</li>
<li>Create property getters/setters for x and y</li>
<li>Handle type conversions automatically</li>
</ul>
<p>This eliminates manual binding code and makes adding new types simple by using the same language at compile time and runtime.</p>
<h3 id="c-interop-that-just-works">C Interop That Just Works<a href="#c-interop-that-just-works" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Zig’s C interop is a first-class feature: you can directly import C header files and call C functions without wrapper libraries.</p>
<p>For example, we use cURL as our HTTP library. We can just import libcurl C headers in Zig and use the C functions directly:</p>

<p>It feels as simple as using C, except you are programming in Zig.</p>
<p>And with the build system it’s also very simple to add the C sources to build everything together (your zig code and the C libraries):</p>

<p>This simplicity of importing C mitigates the fact that the Zig ecosystem is still small, as you can use all the existing C libraries.</p>
<h3 id="the-build-system-advantage">The Build System Advantage<a href="#the-build-system-advantage" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Zig includes its own build system written in Zig itself. This might sound unremarkable, but compared to CMake, it’s refreshingly straightforward. Adding dependencies, configuring compilation flags, and managing cross-compilation all happen in one place with clear semantics. Runtime, comptime, build system: everything is in Zig, which makes things easier.</p>
<p>Cross-compilation in particular is usually a difficult topic, but it’s very easy with Zig. Some projects like <a href="https://thamizhelango.medium.com/why-uber-chose-zig-as-their-c-c-toolchain-a-technical-deep-dive-771584e57c5b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Uber<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a> use Zig mainly as a build system and toolchain.</p>
<h3 id="compile-times-matter">Compile times matter<a href="#compile-times-matter" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Zig compiles fast. Our full rebuild takes under a minute. Not as fast as Go or an interpreted language, but enough to have a feedback loop that makes development feel responsive. In that regard, Zig is considerably faster than Rust or C++.</p>
<p>This is a strong focus of the Zig team. They are also a small team and they need fast compilation for the development of the language, as Zig is written in Zig (self-hosted). For that purpose, they are developing native compiler backends (i.e. not using LLVM), which is very ambitious and yet successful: it’s already the default backend for x86 in debug mode, with a significant improvement in build times (<a href="https://ziglang.org/devlog/2025/#2025-06-08" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">3.5x faster for the Zig project itself<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>).

<h2 id="what-weve-learned">What We’ve Learned<a href="#what-weve-learned" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>After months of building Lightpanda in Zig, here’s what stands out.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The learning curve is manageable.</strong> Zig’s simplicity means you can understand the entire language in a few weeks. Compared to Rust or C++, this makes a real difference.</li>
<li><strong>The allocator model pays off.</strong> Being able to create arena allocators per page load, per request, or per task gives us fine-grained memory control without tracking individual allocations.</li>
<li><strong>The community</strong> is small but helpful. Zig is still growing. The Discord community and <a href="https://ziggit.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ziggit.dev<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a> are active, and the language is simple enough that you can often figure things out by reading the standard library source.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>

<h3 id="is-zig-stable-enough-for-production-use">Is Zig stable enough for production use?<a href="#is-zig-stable-enough-for-production-use" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Zig is still pre-1.0, which means breaking changes can happen between versions. That said, we’ve found it stable enough for our production use, especially since the ecosystem has largely standardized on tracking the latest tagged releases rather than main. The language itself is well-designed, and most changes between versions are improvements that are worth adapting to. Just be prepared to update code when upgrading Zig versions.</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-hardest-part-about-learning-zig">What’s the hardest part about learning Zig?<a href="#whats-the-hardest-part-about-learning-zig" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>The allocator model takes adjustment if you’re coming from garbage-collected languages. You need to think about where memory comes from and when it gets freed. But compared to Rust’s borrow checker or C++‘s memory management, it’s relatively straightforward once you understand the patterns.</p>
<h3 id="can-zig-really-replace-c-for-browser-development">Can Zig really replace C++ for browser development?<a href="#can-zig-really-replace-c-for-browser-development" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>For building a focused browser like Lightpanda, yes. For replacing Chromium or Firefox, that’s unlikely: those projects have millions of lines of C++ and decades of optimization. We’re more likely to see Rust complementing C++ in those projects over time, for example how Firefox is leveraging <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Servo<!-- --> <svg fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="1em"><path d="M7 17L17 7"></path><path d="M7 7h10v10"></path></svg></a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.synadia.com/blog/synadia-tigerbeetle-zig-foundation-pledge">Synadia</a>
and TigerBeetle have together pledged $512,000 to the <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig Software Foundation</a> over the next two
years in support of the language, leadership, and communities building
the future of simpler systems software.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-zig-for-tigerbeetle"></h2>
<p>I first saw Zig in 2018, seven years ago. Two years later, I chose
Zig over C or Rust for TigerBeetle.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-rust"></h2>
<p>In 2020, I was following Rust closely. At the time, Rust’s default
memory philosophy was to crash when out of memory (OOM). However, for
TigerBeetle, I wanted explicit static allocation, following <a href="https://spinroot.com/gerard/pdf/P10.pdf">NASA’s Power of Ten Rules
for Safety-Critical Code</a>, which would become a part of <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/TIGER_STYLE.md">TigerStyle</a>,
a methodology for creating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3WYdYyjek4">safer software in
less time</a>.</p>
<h2 id="simplified-memory-management"></h2>
<p>What I learned is that if you could centralize resource allocation in
time and space (the dimensions that prove tricky for humans writing
software) then this could not only simplify memory management, to design
away some of the need for a borrow checker in the first place, but, more
importantly, also be a forcing function for propagating good design, to
encourage teams to think through the explicit limits or physics of the
software (you have no choice).</p>
<h2 id="not-fearlessly-multithreaded"></h2>
<p>From a performance perspective, I didn’t want TigerBeetle to be
fearlessly multithreaded. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKgfk8lTQuE">Transaction
processing workloads tend to have inherent contention</a>, even to the
point of power law, precluding partitioning and necessitating a
single-threaded architecture. Therefore, Rust’s borrow checker, while a
phenomenal tool for the class of problems it targets, made less sense
for TigerBeetle. TigerBeetle never frees memory and never runs
multithreaded, instead using explicit submission/completion queue
interfaces by design.</p>
<h2 id="correctness-is-a-design-problem"></h2>
<p>Finally, while the borrow checker could achieve local memory safety,
TigerBeetle needed more correctness properties. TigerBeetle needed to be
always correct, and across literally thousands of invariants. <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2023/03/26/zig-and-rust.html">As matklad
would say, this is a harder problem!</a> I had also spent enough time in
memory safe languages to know that local memory safety is no guarantee
of local correctness, let alone distributed system correctness. Per
systems thinking, I believe that total correctness is a design problem,
not a language problem. Language is valuable. But no human language can
guarantee the next Hemingway or Nabokov. For this you need philosophy.
Even then it’s not a guarantee but a probability.</p>
<p>With Rust off the table, the choice fell to C or Zig. A language of
the past or future?</p>
<h2 id="why-zig"></h2>
<p>Zig was early, which gave me pause, but I felt that the quality of
Andrew Kelley’s design decisions in the language, the standard library
(e.g. the unmanaged hashmap interface) and the cross-compilation
toolchain, even five years ago, was already exceptional.</p>
<h2 id="more-than-a-language-a-philosophy"></h2>
<p>Andrews’s philosophy resonated with what I wanted to explore in
TigerStyle. No hidden memory allocations. No hidden control flow. No
preprocessor. No macros. And then you get things like comptime, reducing
the grammar and dimensionality of the language, while simultaneously
multiplying its power. The primary benefit of Zig is the favorable ratio
of expressivity to language complexity.</p>
<h2 id="a-better-c"></h2>
<p>As a replacement for C, Zig fixed not only the small cuts, such as
explicit alignment in the type system for Direct I/O, or safer casts,
but the showstoppers of spatial memory safety through bounds checking,
and, to a lesser degree (but not guarantee), temporal memory safety
through the debug allocator.</p>
<h2 id="checked-arithmetic"></h2>
<p>Zig also enabled checked arithmetic by default in safe builds, which
is something I believe only Ada and Swift do (remarkably, Rust disables
checked arithmetic by default in safe builds—a default I would love to
see changed). TigerBeetle separates the data plane from the control
plane by design, through batching, so the runtime cost of these safety
checks was not material, being amortized in the data plane across bigger
buffers. While a borrow checker or static allocation can simplify memory
management, getting logic and arithmetic correct remains hard. Of
course, you can enable checked arithmetic in other languages, but I
appreciated Andrew’s concern for checked arithmetic and stricter
operands by default.</p>
<h2 id="safety-as-a-spectrum"></h2>
<p>In all these things, what impressed me most was Zig’s approach to
safety when working with the metal. Not in terms of an on/off decision,
but as a spectrum. Not aiming for 100% guarantees across 1 or 2
categories, but 90% and then across more categories. Not eliminating
classes of bugs, but downgrading their probability. All while preserving
the power-to-weight ratio of the language, to keep the language
beautifully simple.</p>
<h2 id="essential-simplicity"></h2>
<p>Many languages start simple and grow complex as features are added.
Zig’s simplicity is unusual in that it comes from a subtractive
discipline (e.g. no private fields) rather than a deferred complexity;
minimizing surface area is part of the ethos of the language. The
simplicity of Zig meant that we could hire great programmers from any
language background—they could pick up Zig in a weekend. Indeed, I’ve
never had to talk to a new hire about learning Zig.</p>
<h2 id="skate-to-where-the-puck-is-going"></h2>
<p>Finally, there was the timing. Recognizing that TigerBeetle would
take time to reach production (we shipped production in 2024, after 3.5
years of development), giving Zig time to mature, for our trajectories
to intersect.</p>
<p>Investing in creating a database like TigerBeetle is a long term
effort. Databases tend to have a long half life (e.g. Postgres is 30
years old). And so, while Zig being early in 2020 did give me pause,
nevertheless Zig’s quality, philosophy and simplicity made sense for a
multi-decade horizon.</p>
<h2 id="fast-forward-five-years-later"></h2>
<p>How has the decision for Zig panned out?</p>
<h2 id="surviving-vopr-vörtex-and-jepsen"></h2>
<p>TigerBeetle is tested end-to-end under some pretty extreme fuzzing.
We did have three bugs that would have been prevented by the borrow
checker, but these were caught by our fuzzers and online verification.
We run a fuzzing fleet of 1,000 dedicated CPU cores 24/7. We invest in
deterministic simulation testing (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/internals/vopr.md">VOPR</a>),
as well as non-deterministic fault-injection harnesses (e.g. <a href="https://tigerbeetle.com/blog/2025-02-13-a-descent-into-the-vortex/">Vörtex</a>).
We engaged Kyle Kingsbury in <a href="https://jepsen.io/analyses/tigerbeetle-0.16.11">one of the longest
Jepsen audits to date</a>—four times the typical duration. Through all
this, Zig’s quality held up flawlessly.</p>
<h2 id="tight-tolerances-and-velocity"></h2>
<p>Zig has also been a huge part of our success as a company.
TigerBeetle is only 5 years old but is already migrating some of the
largest brokerages, exchanges and wealth managements in their respective
jurisdictions. Several of our key enterprise contracts were thanks to
the CTOs and even CEOs of these companies also following Zig and seeing
the quality we wanted to achieve with it. I don’t think we could have
written TigerBeetle <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/uhtjdz/rust_vs_zig_reality_somewhat_friendly#c_8rtrto">as
it is, in any other language</a>, at least not to the same tight
tolerances, let alone with the same velocity.</p>
<h2 id="pre-10-breaking-changes"></h2>
<p>Zig’s language specification will only reach 1.0 when all
experimental areas of the language (e.g. async I/O) are finally done.
For TigerBeetle, we care only about the stable language features we use,
testing our binaries end to end, as we would for any language.
Nevertheless, upgrading to new versions, even with breaking changes, has
only been a pleasure for us as a team. The upgrade work is usually fully
paid for by compilation time reduction. For example, the upgrade from
Zig 0.14.1 to Zig 0.15.2 (with the native x86_64 backend) makes debug
builds 2x faster, and even LLVM release builds become 1.6x faster. With
each release, you can literally feel the sheer amount of effort that the
entire Zig core team put into making Zig the world’s most powerful
programming language—and toolchain.</p>
<h2 id="one-level-deeper"></h2>
<p>Back in 2020, from a production perspective, Zig was more or less a
frontend to LLVM, the same compiler used by Rust, Swift and other
languages. However, by not shying away from also investing in its own
independent compiler backends and toolchain, by appreciating the value
of replacing LLVM long term, Zig is becoming well positioned to gain a
low-level precision and compilation speed that generic LLVM won’t always
be able to match.</p>
<h2 id="long-live-the-bdfl"></h2>
<p>We want Andrew to take his time, to get these things right for the
long term. Fred Brooks once said that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">conceptual
integrity</a> is “the most important consideration” in system design,
that the design must proceed from one mind.</p>
<p>In this spirit, I am grateful for Andrew’s remarkably strong
leadership (and taste) in the design of the language and toolchain.
There can be thankless pressure on an open source project to give in to
the tragedy of the commons. But if anything, in hindsight I think this
is what I’ve most appreciated about choosing Zig for TigerBeetle, that
Zig has a strong BDFL.</p>
<p>Of course, some may hear “BDFL” and see governance risk. But I fear
the opposite: conceptual risk, the harder problem. Brooks was
right—conceptual integrity is almost certainly doomed by committee.
Whereas governance is easier solved: put it in the hands, not of the
corporates, but of the people. The individuals who choose each day to
continue to donate.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-pledge"></h2>
<p>This is why our pledge today, along with all other ZSF donors, is a
simple donation with no strings attached. The Zig Software Foundation is
well managed, transparent and independent. We want it to remain this
way. The last thing we want is some kind of foundation “seat”. Andrew is
Chef. We want to let him cook, and pay his core team sustainably (e.g.
<a href="https://ziglang.org/news/2025-financials/">92% percent of
budget goes to directly paying contributors</a>).</p>
<h2 id="surfing-the-swell"></h2>
<p>If cooking is one metaphor, then surfing is another. I believe that
technology moves in waves. The art is not in paddling to the wave with a
thousand surfers on it. But in spotting the swell before it breaks. And
then enjoying the ride with the early adopters who did the same. <a href="https://isaacfreund.com/software/river/">River</a>, <a href="https://ghostty.org/">Ghostty</a>, <a href="https://bun.com/">Bun</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hexops/mach">Mach</a> and many fellow
surfers.</p>
<h2 id="partnering-with-synadia"></h2>
<p>In fact, it was through Zig that I met <a href="https://x.com/derekcollison">Derek Collison</a>, who like me had
been sponsoring the language in his personal capacity since 2018. As a
former CTO at VMware, Derek was responsible for backing <a href="https://antirez.com/">antirez</a> to work full time on Redis. Derek
later went on to create <a href="https://nats.io/">NATS</a>, founding <a href="https://www.synadia.com/">Synadia</a>.</p>
<p>As we were about to increase TigerBeetle’s yearly donation to Zig, I
reached out to Derek, and we decided to do a joint announcement, <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/zig-donation">following Mitchell
Hashimoto’s lead</a>. For each of our companies to donate $256,000 in
monthly installments over the next two years, with Synadia matching
TigerBeetle, for a total of $512,000—the first installment already
made.</p>
<h2 id="for-great-justice-take-off-every-zig"></h2>
<p>Please consider <a href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/">donating</a> or
increasing your donation if you can. And if you are a CEO or CTO, please
team up with another company to outmatch us! Thanks Andrew for creating
something special, and to all who code for the joy of the craft:</p>
<p>Together we serve the users.</p>

      <p>I have a hobby.</p>
<p>Whenever I see the comment <code>// this should never happen</code> in code, I try to find out the exact conditions under which <em>it could</em> happen.
And in 90% of cases, I find a way to do just that.
More often than not, the developer just hasn’t considered all edge cases or future code changes.</p>
<p>In fact, the reason why I like this comment so much is that it often <strong>marks the exact spot</strong> where strong guarantees fall apart.
Often, violating implicit invariants that aren’t enforced by the compiler are the root cause.</p>
<p>Yes, the compiler prevents memory safety issues, and the standard library is best-in-class.
But even the standard library <a href="https://corrode.dev/blog/pitfalls-of-safe-rust">has its warts</a> and bugs in business logic can still happen.</p>
<p>All we can work with are hard-learned patterns to write more defensive Rust code, learned throughout years of shipping Rust code to production.
I’m not talking about design patterns here, but rather small idioms, which are rarely documented, but make a big difference in the overall code quality.</p>
<h2 id="code-smell-indexing-into-a-vector"><a href="#code-smell-indexing-into-a-vector" aria-label="Anchor link for: code-smell-indexing-into-a-vector">Code Smell: Indexing Into a Vector</a></h2>
<p>Here’s some innocent-looking code:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>if</span> <span>!</span>matching_users<span>.</span><span>is_empty</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span> <span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>let</span> existing_user <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>matching_users<span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span><span>//</span> ...
</span></span></span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>What if you refactor it and forget to keep the <code>is_empty()</code> check?
The problem is that the vector indexing is decoupled from checking the length.
So <code>matching_users[0]</code> can panic at runtime if the vector is empty.</p>
<p>Checking the length and indexing are two separate operations, which can be changed independently.
That’s our first implicit invariant that’s not enforced by the compiler.</p>
<p>If we use slice pattern matching instead, we’ll only get access to the element if the correct <code>match</code> arm is executed.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>match</span> matching_users<span>.</span><span>as_slice</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span> <span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span><span>[</span><span>]</span></span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>todo!</span><span><span>(</span><span><span>"</span>What to do if no users found!?<span>"</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span><span>[</span>existing_user<span>]</span></span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span><span>{</span>  <span> Safe! Compiler guarantees exactly one element
</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>        <span> No need to index into the vector,
</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>        <span> we can directly use `existing_user` here 
</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span><span>}</span></span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>_</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Err</span><span><span>(</span><span>RepositoryError<span>::</span></span>DuplicateUsers</span><span><span>)</span></span>
</span></span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note how this automatically uncovered one more edge case: what if the list is empty?
We hadn’t explicitly considered this case before.
The compiler-enforced pattern matching requires us to think about all possible states!
This is a common pattern in all robust Rust code: putting the compiler in charge of enforcing invariants.</p>
<h2 id="code-smell-lazy-use-of-default"><a href="#code-smell-lazy-use-of-default" aria-label="Anchor link for: code-smell-lazy-use-of-default">Code Smell: Lazy use of <code>Default</code></a></h2>
<p>When initializing an object with many fields, it’s tempting to use <code>..Default::default()</code> to fill in the rest.
In practice, this is a common source of bugs.
You might forget to explicitly set a new field later when you add it to the struct (thus using the default value instead, which might not be what you want), or you might not be aware of all the fields that are being set to default values.</p>
<p>Instead of this:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>let</span> foo <span>=</span> Foo <span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    field1<span>:</span> value1<span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>    field2<span>:</span> value2<span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>..</span><span>Default</span><span><span>::</span></span>default<span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span>  <span><span>//</span> Implicitly sets all other fields
</span></span></span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Do this:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>let</span> foo <span>=</span> Foo <span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    field1<span>:</span> value1<span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>    field2<span>:</span> value2<span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>    field3<span>:</span> value3<span>,</span> <span><span>//</span> Explicitly set all fields
</span></span></span><span><span>    field4<span>:</span> value4<span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span><span>//</span> ...
</span></span></span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Yes, it’s slightly more verbose, but what you gain is that the compiler will force you to handle all fields explicitly.
Now when you add a new field to <code>Foo</code>, the compiler will remind you to set it here as well and reflect on which value makes sense.</p>
<p>If you still prefer to use <code>Default</code> but don’t want to lose compiler checks, you can also destructure the default instance:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>let</span> Foo <span><span>{</span> field1<span>,</span> field2<span>,</span> field3<span>,</span> field4 </span><span><span>}</span></span> <span>=</span> <span>Foo<span>::</span></span>default<span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This way, you get all the default values assigned to local variables and you can still override what you need:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>let</span> foo <span>=</span> Foo <span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    field1<span>:</span> value1<span>,</span>    <span><span>//</span> Override what you need
</span></span></span><span><span>    field2<span>:</span> value2<span>,</span>    <span><span>//</span> Override what you need
</span></span></span><span><span>    field3<span>,</span>            <span><span>//</span> Use default value
</span></span></span><span><span>    field4<span>,</span>            <span><span>//</span> Use default value
</span></span></span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This pattern gives you the best of both worlds:</p>
<ul>
<li>You get default values without duplicating default logic</li>
<li>The compiler will complain when new fields are added to the struct</li>
<li>Your code automatically adapts when default values change</li>
<li>It’s clear which fields use defaults and which have custom values</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="code-smell-fragile-trait-implementations"><a href="#code-smell-fragile-trait-implementations" aria-label="Anchor link for: code-smell-fragile-trait-implementations">Code Smell: Fragile Trait Implementations</a></h2>
<p>Completely destructuring a struct into its components can also be a defensive strategy for API adherence.
For example, let’s say you’re building a pizza ordering system and have an order type like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>struct</span> </span><span><span>PizzaOrder</span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>size</span><span>:</span> PizzaSize,
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>toppings</span><span>:</span> <span><span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span>Topping<span>&gt;</span></span>,
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>crust_type</span><span>:</span> CrustType,
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>ordered_at</span><span>:</span> SystemTime,
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>For your order tracking system, you want to compare orders based on what’s actually on the pizza - the <code>size</code>, <code>toppings</code>, and <code>crust_type</code>. The <code>ordered_at</code> timestamp shouldn’t affect whether two orders are considered the same.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem with the obvious approach:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>impl</span> </span><span>PartialEq <span>for</span></span><span> <span>PizzaOrder</span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span><span><span>fn</span> </span><span>eq</span></span><span><span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span>, <span>other</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>Self</span></span><span><span><span>)</span></span></span></span><span> <span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span></span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>        <span>self</span><span>.</span>size <span>==</span> other<span>.</span>size 
</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>            <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span>toppings <span>==</span> other<span>.</span>toppings 
</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>            <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span>crust_type <span>==</span> other<span>.</span>crust_type
</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>            </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>    </span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now imagine your team adds a field for customization options:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>struct</span> </span><span><span>PizzaOrder</span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>size</span><span>:</span> PizzaSize,
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>toppings</span><span>:</span> <span><span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span>Topping<span>&gt;</span></span>,
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>crust_type</span><span>:</span> CrustType,
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>ordered_at</span><span>:</span> SystemTime,
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>extra_cheese</span><span>:</span> <span>bool</span>, <span> New field added
</span></span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Your <code>PartialEq</code> implementation still compiles, but is it correct?
Should <code>extra_cheese</code> be part of the equality check?
Probably yes - a pizza with extra cheese is a different order!
But you’ll never know because the compiler won’t remind you to think about it.</p>
<p>Here’s the defensive approach using destructuring:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>impl</span> </span><span>PartialEq <span>for</span></span><span> <span>PizzaOrder</span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span><span><span>fn</span> </span><span>eq</span></span><span><span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span>, <span>other</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>Self</span></span><span><span><span>)</span></span></span></span><span> <span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span></span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>        <span>let</span> <span>Self</span> <span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>            size<span>,</span>
</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>            toppings<span>,</span>
</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>            crust_type<span>,</span>
</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>            ordered_at<span>:</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span>
</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>        </span><span><span>}</span></span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>;</span>
</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>        <span>let</span> <span>Self</span> <span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>            size<span>:</span> other_size<span>,</span>
</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>            toppings<span>:</span> other_toppings<span>,</span>
</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>            crust_type<span>:</span> other_crust<span>,</span>
</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>            ordered_at<span>:</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span>
</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>        </span><span><span>}</span></span> <span>=</span> other<span>;</span>
</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>
</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>        size <span>==</span> other_size <span>&amp;&amp;</span> toppings <span>==</span> other_toppings <span>&amp;&amp;</span> crust_type <span>==</span> other_crust
</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>    </span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now when someone adds the <code>extra_cheese</code> field, this code won’t compile anymore.
The compiler forces you to decide: should <code>extra_cheese</code> be included in the comparison or explicitly ignored with <code>extra_cheese: _</code>?</p>
<p>This pattern works for any trait implementation where you need to handle struct fields: <code>Hash</code>, <code>Debug</code>, <code>Clone</code>, etc.
It’s especially valuable in codebases where structs evolve frequently as requirements change.</p>
<h2 id="code-smell-from-impls-that-are-really-tryfrom"><a href="#code-smell-from-impls-that-are-really-tryfrom" aria-label="Anchor link for: code-smell-from-impls-that-are-really-tryfrom">Code Smell: <code>From</code> Impls That Are Really <code>TryFrom</code></a></h2>
<p>Sometimes there’s no conversion that will work 100% of the time.
That’s fine.
When that’s the case, resist the temptation to offer a <code>From</code> implementation out of habit; use <code>TryFrom</code> instead.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of <code>TryFrom</code> in disguise:</p>

<p>The <code>unwrap_or_else</code> is a hint that this conversion can fail in some way.
We set a default value instead, but is it really the right thing to do for all callers?
This should be a <code>TryFrom</code> implementation instead, making the fallible nature explicit.
We fail fast instead of continuing with a potentially flawed business logic.</p>

<p>It’s tempting to use <code>match</code> in combination with a catch-all pattern like <code>_ =&gt; {}</code>, but this can haunt you later.
The problem is that you might forget to handle a new case that was added later.</p>
<p>Instead of:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>match</span> <span>self</span> <span><span>{</span>

<p>Use:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>match</span> <span>self</span> <span><span>{</span>

<p>By spelling out all variants explicitly, the compiler will warn you when a new variant is added, forcing you to handle it.

<p>Using <code>_</code> as a placeholder for unused variables can lead to confusion.
For example, you might get confused about which variable was skipped.
That’s especially true for boolean flags:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>match</span> <span>self</span> <span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>Self</span><span><span>::</span></span>Rocket <span><span>{</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>..</span> </span><span><span>}</span></span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span><span>{</span> <span> ... </span> </span><span><span>}</span></span>
</span></span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>In the above example, it’s not clear which variables were skipped and why.
Better to use descriptive names for the variables that are not used:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>match</span> <span>self</span> <span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>Self</span><span><span>::</span></span>Rocket <span><span>{</span> has_fuel<span>:</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> has_crew<span>:</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>..</span> </span><span><span>}</span></span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span><span>{</span> <span> ... </span> </span><span><span>}</span></span>
</span></span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Even if you don’t use the variables, it’s clear what they represent and the code becomes more readable and easier to review without inline type hints.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-temporary-mutability"><a href="#pattern-temporary-mutability" aria-label="Anchor link for: pattern-temporary-mutability">Pattern: Temporary Mutability</a></h2>
<p>If you only want your data to be mutable temporarily, make that explicit.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> data <span>=</span> <span>get_vec</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span><span>data<span>.</span><span>sort</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>let</span> data <span>=</span> data<span>;</span>  <span><span>//</span> Shadow to make immutable
</span></span><span>
</span><span><span><span>//</span> Here `data` is immutable.
</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This pattern is often called “temporary mutability” and helps prevent accidental modifications after initialization.
See the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/idioms/temporary-mutability.html">Rust unofficial patterns book</a> for more details.</p>
<p>You can go one step further and do the initialization part in a scope block:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>let</span> data <span>=</span> <span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> data <span>=</span> <span>get_vec</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span>    data<span>.</span><span>sort</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span>    data  <span><span>//</span> Return the final value
</span></span></span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span><span>//</span> Here `data` is immutable
</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This way, the mutable variable is confined to the inner scope, making it clear that it’s only used for initialization.
In case you use any temporary variables during initialization, they won’t leak into the outer scope.
In our case above, there were none, but imagine if we had a temporary vector to hold intermediate results:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>let</span> data <span>=</span> <span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> data <span>=</span> <span>get_vec</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>let</span> temp <span>=</span> <span>compute_something</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span>    data<span>.</span><span>extend</span><span><span>(</span>temp</span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span>    data<span>.</span><span>sort</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span>    data  <span><span>//</span> Return the final value
</span></span></span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>temp</code> is only accessible within the inner scope, which prevents it from accidental use later on.</p>
<p>This is especially useful when you have multiple temporary variables during initialization that you don’t want accessible in the rest of the function.
The scope makes it crystal clear that these variables are only meant for initialization.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-defensively-handle-constructors"><a href="#pattern-defensively-handle-constructors" aria-label="Anchor link for: pattern-defensively-handle-constructors">Pattern: Defensively Handle Constructors</a></h2>
<div>
  
  
  
  <p>The following pattern is only truly helpful for libraries and APIs that need to be robust against future changes.
In such a case, you want to ensure that all instances of a type are created through a constructor function that enforces validation logic.
Because without that, future refactorings can easily lead to invalid states.</p>
<p>For application code, it’s probably best to keep things simple.
You typically have all the call sites under control and can ensure that validation logic is always called.</p>

</div>
<p>Let’s say you have a simple type like the following:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> </span><span><span>S</span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>pub</span> <span>field1</span><span>:</span> String,
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>pub</span> <span>field2</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span>,
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now you want to add validation logic to ensure invalid states are never created.
One pattern is to return a <code>Result</code> from the constructor:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>impl</span> </span><span><span>S</span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> </span><span>new</span></span><span><span><span>(</span><span>field1</span><span>:</span> String, <span>field2</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span></span><span><span><span>)</span></span></span></span><span> <span><span>-&gt;</span> <span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span>, <span>String</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>

</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>        </span><span><span>}</span></span>
</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>        <span>if</span> field2 <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>            <span>return</span> <span>Err</span><span><span>(</span><span><span>"</span>field2 cannot be zero<span>"</span></span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>        </span><span><span>}</span></span>
</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>        <span>Ok</span><span><span>(</span><span>Self</span> <span><span>{</span> field1<span>,</span> field2 </span><span><span>}</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span>
</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>    </span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>But nothing stops someone from bypassing your validation by creating an instance directly:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>let</span> s <span>=</span> S <span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    field1<span>:</span> <span><span>"</span><span>"</span></span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>    field2<span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This should not be possible!
It is our implicit invariant that’s not enforced by the compiler: the validation logic is decoupled from struct construction.
These are two separate operations, which can be changed independently and the compiler won’t complain.</p>
<p>To force <strong>external code</strong> to go through your constructor, add a private field:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> </span><span><span>S</span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>pub</span> <span>field1</span><span>:</span> String,

</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>_private</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span>, <span> This prevents external construction 
</span></span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span><span>impl</span> </span><span><span>S</span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>

</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now code outside your module cannot construct <code>S</code> directly because it cannot access the <code>_private</code> field.
The compiler enforces that all construction must go through your <code>new()</code> method, which includes your validation logic!</p>
<div>
  
  
  
  <p>Note that the underscore prefix is just a <strong>naming convention</strong> to indicate the field is intentionally unused; it’s the lack of <code>pub</code> that makes it private and prevents external construction.</p>

</div>
<p>For libraries that need to evolve over time, you can also use the <code>#[non_exhaustive]</code> attribute instead:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>#</span><span>[</span><span>non_exhaustive</span><span>]</span></span>
</span><span><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> </span><span><span>S</span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>pub</span> <span>field1</span><span>:</span> String,
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span>pub</span> <span>field2</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span>,
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This has the same effect of preventing construction outside your crate, but also signals to users that you might add more fields in the future.
The compiler will prevent them from using struct literal syntax, forcing them to use your constructor.</p>
<div>
  
  
  
  <p>There’s a big difference between these two approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#[non_exhaustive]</code> only works across crate boundaries. <strong>It prevents construction outside your crate.</strong></li>
<li><code>_private</code> works at the module boundary. <strong>It prevents construction outside the module</strong>, but within the same crate.</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of that, some developers find <code>_private: ()</code> more explicit about intent: “this struct has a private field that prevents construction.”</p>
<p>With <code>#[non_exhaustive]</code>, the primary intent is signaling that fields might be added in the future, and preventing construction is more of a side effect.</p>

</div>
<p>But what about code within the <strong>same module</strong>?
With the patterns above, code in the same module can still bypass your validation:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>//</span> Still compiles in the same module!
</span></span><span><span>let</span> s <span>=</span> S <span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    field1<span>:</span> <span><span>"</span><span>"</span></span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>    field2<span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>    _private<span>:</span> <span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Rust’s privacy works at the module level, not the type level.
Anything in the same module can access private items.</p>
<p>If you need to enforce constructor usage even within your own module, you need a more defensive approach using nested private modules:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>mod</span> <span>inner</span> <span><span>{</span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    <span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> </span><span><span>S</span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>

<p>Now the only way to create an instance of <code>S</code> is through the <code>new()</code> method, and the only way to access its fields is through the getter methods.</p>
<h3 id="when-to-use-each"><a href="#when-to-use-each" aria-label="Anchor link for: when-to-use-each">When to Use Each</a></h3>
<p>To enforce validation through constructors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For external code</strong>: Add a private field like <code>_private: ()</code> or use <code>#[non_exhaustive]</code></li>
<li><strong>For internal code</strong>: Use nested private modules with a private “seal” type</li>
<li><strong>Choose based on your needs</strong>: Most code only needs to prevent external construction; forcing internal construction is more defensive but also more complex</li>
</ul>
<p>The key insight is that by making construction impossible without access to a private type, you turn your validation logic from a convention into a guarantee enforced by the compiler.
So let’s put that compiler to work!</p>

<p>This is especially useful for guard types that need to be held for their lifetime and results from operations that must be checked.
The standard library uses this extensively.
For example, <code>Result</code> is marked with <code>#[must_use]</code>, which is why you get warnings if you don’t handle errors.</p>

<p>This is much more readable and the compiler will catch mistakes if you pass the wrong enum type.
You will notice that the enum variants can be more descriptive than just <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.
And more often than not, there are more than two meaningful options; especially for programs which grow over time.</p>
<p>For functions with many options, you can configure them using a parameter struct:</p>

<p>This approach scales much better as your function evolves.
Adding new parameters doesn’t break existing call sites, and you can easily add defaults or make certain fields optional.
The preset methods also document common use cases and make it easy to use the right configuration for different scenarios.</p>
<p>Rust is often criticized for not having named parameters, but using a parameter struct is arguably even better for larger functions with many options.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Defensive programming in Rust is about leveraging the type system and compiler to catch bugs before they happen.
By following these patterns, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make implicit invariants explicit and compiler-checked</li>
<li>Future-proof your code against refactoring mistakes</li>
<li>Reduce the surface area for bugs</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a skill that doesn’t come naturally and it’s not covered in most Rust books, but knowing these patterns can make the difference between code that works but is brittle, and code that is robust and maintainable for years to come.</p>
<p>Remember: if you find yourself writing <code>// this should never happen</code>, take a step back and ask how the compiler could enforce that invariant for you instead.
The best bug is the one that never compiles in the first place.</p>

I have a Delaware registered LLC (10 years old), I managed to get even an EIN remotely. 
However, I can't open a bank account remotely and so I have just been paying the registered agent fees and Delaware gov taxes for the LLC all these years.

The LLC hasn't really had any annual meetings/etc. but taxes are always paid on time. How do I use my LLC to apply for a B1/B2 to visit the US?</p><p>OR should I just close it and try the normal route?

</p>
<p>MetaComputing is now offering an alternative to Intel, AMD and the Snapdragon X series. Specifically, the company has introduced a mainboard that can be installe in the Framework Laptop 13 or in a mini PC case. This mainboard is equipped with a CIX CP8180 ARM chipset, which is also found inside the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Minisforum-releases-new-MS-R1-mini-PC-with-powerful-CIX-CP8180-ARM-chipset-and-up-to-64-GB-of-RAM.1159513.0.html" target="_self">Minisforum MS-R1</a>. This processor has a total of eight ARM Cortex-A720 performance cores, the two fastest can hit boost clock speeds of up to 2.6 GHz.

This chipset is likely slower than the Snapdragon X Elite or a current flagship smartphone chip, but it should still provide enough performance for many everyday tasks. Either way, this mainboard upgrade might only be interesting for developers for the most part, because <a href="https://www.cnx-software.com/2025/11/11/500-minisforum-ms-r1-arm-linux-ai-mini-pc-features-cix-cp8180-12-core-soc-up-to-64gb-lpddr5x/" target="_blank">early tests</a> show that the SoC already draws about 16 watts at idle, which means battery life will likely be fairly short when combined with the 55Wh battery of the Framework Laptop 13.
</p>
<h2>Price and availability</h2>
<p>The MetaComputing ARM AI PC Kit is available now at the manufacturer’s <a href="https://metacomputing.io/products/metacomputing-arm-aipc" target="_blank">official online shop</a>. The base model with 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD and a mini PC case costs $549. The mainboard can be installed in a previously purchased Framework Laptop 13. Users who don’t own a Framework Laptop can order a bundle including the notebook for $999. MetaComputing charges an additional $100 for 32GB RAM. Shipping is free worldwide, but these list prices do not include import fees or taxes.</p></div><div id="c15113124"><p><iframe id="nbcYT_15113124" name="nbcYT_15113124" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dfFpXEY1Y1U" title="YouTube Video Player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><div id="c15113121">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><p>2025-12-05</p><section><p>5 min read</p><img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5NoiDo8eH6E6bTJYfEqoe9/60cbcc5d7d59e4c68a99a22026d221d8/image2.png" alt=""><div><p>On December 5, 2025, at 08:47 UTC (all times in this blog are UTC), a portion of Cloudflare’s network began experiencing significant failures. The incident was resolved at 09:12 (~25 minutes total impact), when all services were fully restored.</p><p>A subset of customers were impacted, accounting for approximately 28% of all HTTP traffic served by Cloudflare. Several factors needed to combine for an individual customer to be affected as described below.</p><p>The issue was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a cyber attack on Cloudflare’s systems or malicious activity of any kind. Instead, it was triggered by changes being made to our body parsing logic while attempting to detect and mitigate an industry-wide vulnerability <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/waf-rules-react-vulnerability/"><u>disclosed this week</u></a> in React Server Components.</p><p>Any outage of our systems is unacceptable, and we know we have let the Internet down again following the incident on November 18. We will be publishing details next week about the work we are doing to stop these types of incidents from occurring.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="what-happened">What happened</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>The graph below shows HTTP 500 errors served by our network during the incident timeframe (red line at the bottom), compared to unaffected total Cloudflare traffic (green line at the top).</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/43yFyHQhKjhPoLh4yB7pQ8/c1eb08a3e056530311e6056ecac522ed/image1.png" alt="500 error codes served by Cloudflare’s network during the incident" width="1999" height="955" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>Cloudflare's Web Application Firewall (WAF) provides customers with protection against malicious payloads, allowing them to be detected and blocked. To do this, Cloudflare’s proxy buffers HTTP request body content in memory for analysis. Before today, the buffer size was set to 128KB.</p><p>As part of our ongoing work to protect customers using React against a critical vulnerability, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-55182"><u>CVE-2025-55182</u></a>, we started rolling out an increase to our buffer size to 1MB, the default limit allowed by Next.js applications. We wanted to make sure as many customers as possible were protected.</p><p>This change was being rolled out using our gradual deployment system, and, as part of this rollout, we identified an increase in errors in one of our internal tools which we use to test and improve new WAF rules. As this was an internal tool, and the fix being rolled out was a security improvement, we decided to disable the tool for the time being as it was not required to serve or protect customer traffic.</p><p>Disabling this was done using our global configuration system. This system does not use gradual rollouts but rather propagates changes within seconds to the entire network and is under review <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/"><u>following the outage we recently experienced on November 18</u></a>.</p><p>In our FL1 version of our proxy under certain circumstances, this latter change caused an error state that resulted in 500 HTTP error codes to be served from our network.</p><p>As soon as the change propagated to our network, code execution in our FL1 proxy reached a bug in our rules module which led to the following LUA exception:</p>
            <pre><code>[lua] Failed to run module rulesets callback late_routing: /usr/local/nginx-fl/lua/modules/init.lua:314: attempt to index field 'execute' (a nil value)</code></pre>
            <p>resulting in HTTP code 500 errors being issued.</p><p>The issue was identified shortly after the change was applied, and was reverted at 09:12, after which all traffic was served correctly.</p><p>Customers that have their web assets served by our older FL1 proxy <b>AND</b> had the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset deployed were impacted. All requests for websites in this state returned an HTTP 500 error, with the small exception of some test endpoints such as <code>/cdn-cgi/trace</code>.</p><p>Customers that did not have the configuration above applied were not impacted. Customer traffic served by our China network was also not impacted.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="the-runtime-error">The runtime error</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Cloudflare’s rulesets system consists of sets of rules which are evaluated for each request entering our system. A rule consists of a filter, which selects some traffic, and an action which applies an effect to that traffic. Typical actions are “<code>block</code>”, “<code>log</code>”, or “<code>skip</code>”. Another type of action is “<code>execute</code>”, which is used to trigger evaluation of another ruleset.</p><p>Our internal logging system uses this feature to evaluate new rules before we make them available to the public. A top level ruleset will execute another ruleset containing test rules. It was these test rules that we were attempting to disable.</p><p>We have a killswitch subsystem as part of the rulesets system which is intended to allow a rule which is misbehaving to be disabled quickly. This killswitch system receives information from our global configuration system mentioned in the prior sections. We have used this killswitch system on a number of occasions in the past to mitigate incidents and have a well-defined Standard Operating Procedure, which was followed in this incident.</p><p>However, we have never before applied a killswitch to a rule with an action of “<code>execute</code>”. When the killswitch was applied, the code correctly skipped the evaluation of the execute action, and didn’t evaluate the sub-ruleset pointed to by it. However, an error was then encountered while processing the overall results of evaluating the ruleset:</p>
            <pre><code>if rule_result.action == "execute" then
  rule_result.execute.results = ruleset_results[tonumber(rule_result.execute.results_index)]
end</code></pre>
            <p>This code expects that, if the ruleset has action=”execute”, the “rule_result.execute” object will exist. However, because the rule had been skipped, the rule_result.execute object did not exist, and Lua returned an error due to attempting to look up a value in a nil value.</p><p>This is a straightforward error in the code, which had existed undetected for many years. This type of code error is prevented by languages with strong type systems. In our replacement for this code in our new FL2 proxy, which is written in Rust, the error did not occur.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="what-about-the-changes-being-made-after-the-incident-on-november-18-2025">What about the changes being made after the incident on November 18, 2025?</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>We made an unrelated change that caused a similar, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/"><u>longer availability incident</u></a> two weeks ago on November 18, 2025. In both cases, a deployment to help mitigate a security issue for our customers propagated to our entire network and led to errors for nearly all of our customer base.</p><p>We have spoken directly with hundreds of customers following that incident and shared our plans to make changes to prevent single updates from causing widespread impact like this. We believe these changes would have helped prevent the impact of today’s incident but, unfortunately, we have not finished deploying them yet.</p><p>We know it is disappointing that this work has not been completed yet. It remains our first priority across the organization. In particular, the projects outlined below should help contain the impact of these kinds of changes:</p><ul><li><p><b>Enhanced Rollouts &amp; Versioning</b>: Similar to how we slowly deploy software with strict health validation, data used for rapid threat response and general configuration needs to have the same safety and blast mitigation features. This includes health validation and quick rollback capabilities among other things.</p></li><li><p><b>Streamlined break glass capabilities:</b> Ensure that critical operations can still be achieved in the face of additional types of failures. This applies to internal services as well as all standard methods of interaction with the Cloudflare control plane used by all Cloudflare customers.</p></li><li><p><b>"Fail-Open" Error Handling: </b>As part of the resilience effort, we are replacing the incorrectly applied hard-fail logic across all critical Cloudflare data-plane components. If a configuration file is corrupt or out-of-range (e.g., exceeding feature caps), the system will log the error and default to a known-good state or pass traffic without scoring, rather than dropping requests. Some services will likely give the customer the option to fail open or closed in certain scenarios. This will include drift-prevention capabilities to ensure this is enforced continuously.</p></li></ul><p>Before the end of next week we will publish a detailed breakdown of all the resiliency projects underway, including the ones listed above. While that work is underway, we are locking down all changes to our network in order to ensure we have better mitigation and rollback systems before we begin again.</p><p>These kinds of incidents, and how closely they are clustered together, are not acceptable for a network like ours. On behalf of the team at Cloudflare we want to apologize for the impact and pain this has caused again to our customers and the Internet as a whole.</p>

In a retraction notice dated Friday, November 28, the journal <a href="https://doi.org/10.1006/rtph.1999.1371" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Nouvelle fenêtre"><em>Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology</em></a> announced that the study, published in April 2000 and concluding the herbicide was safe, has been removed from its archives. The disavowal comes 25 years after publication and eight years after thousands of internal Monsanto documents were made public during US court proceedings (the "Monsanto Papers"), revealing that the actual authors of the article were not the listed scientists – Gary M. Williams (New York Medical College), Robert Kroes (Ritox, Utrecht University, Netherlands), and Ian C.

<h3>
Most Technical Problems Are Really People Problems
</h3>
</div><div id="post-body-7374304832122251961">
<p><img height="360" id="image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg7QOyg3tGApI64WD9aRzm3Osedu5QzuscDmKGEeIwDQq0_w8LTnDiX5F4R7pAxY5SN6wRNICTO55ifch-iIVXenTD-HBB3WHfLMGmoJST0xqNwD_CP0MiRzNxYKAvxpnuT6TDck5xWk9a6YMbd6bYZrG6mYGf1kF6ipL4EmqvbT0FXkVrTD70ZRhRvh_A=w640-h360" width="640">&nbsp;</p><p>I once worked at a company which had an enormous amount of technical debt - millions of lines of code, no unit tests, based on frameworks that were well over a decade out of date.&nbsp; On one specific project, we had a market need to get some Windows-only modules running on Linux, and rather than&nbsp;cross-compiling, another team had simply copied &amp; pasted a few hundred thousand lines of code, swapping Windows-specific components for Linux-specific.</p><p>For the non-technical reader, this is an enormous problem because now two versions of the code exist.&nbsp; So, all features &amp; bug fixes must be solved in two separate codebases that will grow apart over time.&nbsp; When I heard about this, a&nbsp;young &amp; naive version of me set out to fix the situation....</p><p><b>Tech debt projects are always a hard sell to management, because even if everything goes flawlessly, the code just does roughly what it did before.</b>&nbsp; This project was no exception, and the optics weren't great.&nbsp; I did as many engineers do and "ignored the politics", put my head down, and got it done.&nbsp; But, the project went long, and I lost a lot of clout in the process.</p><p>I realized I was essentially trying to solve a <i>people</i> problem with a <i>technical</i> solution.&nbsp; Most of the developers at this company were happy doing the same thing today that they did yesterday...and five years ago.&nbsp; As <a href="https://andrewharmellaw.github.io/" target="_blank">Andrew Harmel-Law</a>&nbsp;points out, code tends to follow the personalities of the people that wrote it.&nbsp; The code was calcified because the developers were also.&nbsp; Personality types who dislike change tend not to design their code with future change in mind.</p><p><b>Most technical problems are really people problems.</b>&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; Why does technical debt exist?&nbsp; Because requirements weren't properly clarified before work began.&nbsp; Because a salesperson promised an unrealistic deadline to a customer.&nbsp; Because a developer chose an outdated technology because it was comfortable.&nbsp; Because management was too reactive and cancelled a project mid-flight.&nbsp; Because someone's ego wouldn't let them see a better way of doing things.</p><p>The core issue with the project was that admitting the need for refactoring was also to admit that the way the company was building software was broken and that individual skillsets were sorely out of date.&nbsp; My small team was trying to fix one module of many, while other developers were writing code as they had been for decades.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had one developer openly tell me, "I don't want to learn anything new."&nbsp; I realized that <b>you'll never clean up tech debt faster than others create it.</b>&nbsp; It is like triage in an emergency room, <b>you must stop the bleeding first</b>, then you can fix whatever is broken.</p><h2>An Ideal World&nbsp;</h2><p>The project also disabused me of the engineer's ideal of a world in which engineering problems can be solved in a vacuum - staying out of "politics" and letting the work speak for itself - a world where deadlines don't exist...and let's be honest, neither do customers.&nbsp; This ideal world rarely exists.&nbsp; The vast majority of projects have non-technical stakeholders, and telling them "just trust me; we're working on it" doesn't cut it.&nbsp; I realized that <b>the&nbsp;<i>perception</i>&nbsp;that your team is getting a lot done is just as important as getting a lot done.</b></p><p>Non-technical people do not intuitively understand the level of effort required or the need for tech debt cleanup; it must be communicated effectively by engineering - in both initial estimates &amp; project updates.&nbsp; Unless leadership has an engineering background, the value of the technical debt work likely needs to be <i>quantified</i>&nbsp;and shown as <i>business</i> value.</p><h2>Heads Up&nbsp;</h2><p>Perhaps these are the lessons that prep one for more senior positions.&nbsp; In my opinion, anyone above senior engineer level needs to know how to collaborate cross-functionally, regardless of whether they choose a technical or management track.&nbsp; Schools teach Computer Science, not navigating personalities, egos, and personal blindspots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I have worked with some incredible engineers, better than myself - the type that have deep technical knowledge on just about any technology you bring up.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was younger, I wanted to be that engineer -&nbsp;the "engineer's engineer".&nbsp; But I realize now, that is not my personality.&nbsp; I'm too ADD for that. :)</p><p>For all of their (considerable) strengths, more often than not, those engineers shy away from the interpersonal.&nbsp; The 
tragedy is that they are incredibly productive ICs, but may fail
 with bigger initiatives because they are only one person - a single 
processor core can only go so fast.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps equally valuable is the "heads <i>up</i> coder" - the person who is deeply technical, but also able to pick their head up &amp; see project risks coming (technical &amp; otherwise) and steer the team around them.</p>

<article>
    

    
    <div>
            <p>I don't like RSS readers. I know, this is blasphemous especially on a website where I'm actively encouraging you to subscribe through RSS. As someone writing stuff, RSS is great for me. I don't have to think about it, the requests are pretty light weight, I don't need to think about your personal data or what client you are using. So as a <em>protocol</em> RSS is great, no notes. </p><p>However as something I'm going to consume, it's frankly <em>a giant chore</em>. I feel pressured by RSS readers, where there is this endlessly growing backlog of things I haven't read. I rarely want to read all of a websites content from beginning to end, instead I like to jump between them. I also don't really care if the content is chronological, like an old post about something interesting isn't less compelling to me than a newer post. </p><p>What I want, as a user experience, is something akin to TikTok. The whole appeal of TikTok, for those who haven't wasted hours of their lives on it, is that I get served content based on an algorithm that determines what I might think is useful or fun. However what I would like is to go through content from random small websites. I want to sit somewhere and passively consume random small creators content, then upvote some of that content and the service should show that more often to other users. That's it. No advertising, no collecting tons of user data about me, just a very simple "I have 15 minutes to kill before the next meeting, show me some random stuff."</p><p>In this case the "algorithm" is pretty simple: if more people like a thing, more people see it. But with Google on its way to replacing search results with LLM generated content, I just wanted to have something that let me play around with the small web the way that I used to. </p><p>There actually used to be a service like this called StumbleUpon which was more focused on pushing users towards popular sites. It has been taken down, presumably because there was no money in a browser plugin that sent users to other websites whose advertising you didn't control. </p><h3 id="tldr">TL;DR </h3><p>You can go download the Firefox extension now and try this out and skip the rest of this if you want. <a href="https://timewasterpro.xyz/">https://timewasterpro.xyz/</a> If you hate it or find problems, let me know on Mastodon. <a href="https://c.im/@matdevdug">https://c.im/@matdevdug</a></p><h3 id="functionality">Functionality </h3><p>So I wanted to do something pretty basic. You hit a button, get served a new website. If you like the website, upvote it, otherwise downvote it. If you think it has objectionable content then hit report. You have to make an account (because I couldn't think of another way to do it) and then if you submit links and other people like it, you climb a Leaderboard. </p><p>On the backend I want to (very slowly so I don't cost anyone a bunch of money) crawl a bunch of RSS feeds, stick the pages in a database and then serve them up to users. Then I want to track what sites get upvotes and return those more often to other users so that "high quality" content shows up more often. "High quality" would be defined by the community or just me if I'm the only user. </p><p>It's pretty basic stuff, most of it copied from tutorials scattered around the Internet. However I <em>really</em> want to drive home to users that this is not a Serious Thing. I'm not a company, this isn't a new social media network, there are no plans to "grow" this concept beyond the original idea unless people smarter than me ping with me ideas. So I found this amazing CSS library: <a href="https://sakofchit.github.io/system.css/">https://sakofchit.github.io/system.css/</a></p><p>The Apple's System OS design from the late-80s to the early 90s was one of my personal favorites and I think would send a strong signal to a user that this is not a professional, modern service. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/11/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="670" height="1138" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/11/image-1.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/11/image-1.png 670w"></figure><p>Great, the basic layout works. Let's move on!</p><h3 id="backend">Backend</h3><p>So I ended up doing FastAPI because it's very easy to write. I didn't want to spend a ton of time writing the API because I doubt I nailed the API design on the first round. I use sqlalchemy for the database. The basic API layout is as follows:</p><ul><li>admin - mostly just generating read-only reports of like "how many websites are there"</li><li>leaderboard - So this is my first attempt at trying to get users involved. Submit a website that other people like? Get points, climb leaderboard. </li></ul><p>The source for the RSS feeds came from the (very cool) Kagi small web Github. <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb">https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb</a>. Basically I assume that websites that have submitted their RSS feeds here are cool with me (very rarely) checking for new posts and adding them to my database. If you want the same thing as this does, but as an iFrame, that's the Kagi small web service. </p><p>The scraping work is straightforward. We make a background worker, they grab 5 feeds every 600 seconds, they check for new content on each feed and then wait until the 600 seconds has elapsed to grab 5 more from the smallweb list of RSS feeds. Since we have a lot of feeds, this ends up look like we're checking for new content less than once a day which is the interval that I want. </p><p>Then we write it out to a sqlite database and basically track "has this URL been reported", if so, put it into a review queue and then how many times this URL has been liked or disliked. I considered a "real" database but honestly sqlite is getting more and more scalable every day and its impossible to beat the immediate start up and functionality. Plus very easy to back up to encrypted object storage which is super nice for a hobby project where you might wipe the prod database at any moment. </p><p>In terms of user onboarding I ended up doing the "make an account with an email, I send a link to verify the email". I actually hate this flow and I don't really want to know a users email. I never need to contact you and there's not a lot associated with your account, which makes this especially silly. I have a ton of email addresses and no real "purpose" in having them. I'd switch to Login with Apple, which is great from a security perspective but not everybody has an Apple ID. </p><p>I also did a passkey version, which worked fine but the OSS passkey handling was pretty rough still and most people seem to be using a commercial service that handled the "do you have the passkey? Great, if not, fall back to email" flow. I don't really want to do a big commercial login service for a hobby application. </p><p>Auth is a JWT, which actually was a pain and I regret doing it. I don't know why I keep reaching for JWTs, they're a bad user experience and I should stop. </p><h3 id="can-i-just-have-the-source-code">Can I just have the source code?</h3><p>I'm more than happy to release the source code once I feel like the product is in a somewhat stable shape. I'm still ripping down and rewriting relatively large chunks of it as I find weird behavior I don't like or just decide to do things a different way. </p><p>In the end it does seem to do whats on the label. We have over 600,000 individual pages indexed. </p><h3 id="so-how-is-it-to-use">So how is it to use?</h3><p>Honestly I've been pretty pleased. But there are some problems. </p><p>First I couldn't find a reliable way of switching the keyboard shortcuts to be Mac/Windows specific. I found some options for querying platform but they didn't seem to work, so I ended up just hardcoding them as Alt which is not great. </p><p>The other issue is that when you are making an extension, you spend a long time working with these manifests.json. The specific part I really wasn't sure about was: </p><pre><code>"browser_specific_settings": {
    "gecko": {
      "id": "<a href="https://matduggan.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="7d1c191014133d091410180a1c0e09180f0d0f1253050407">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>",
      "strict_min_version": "80.0",
      "data_collection_permissions": {
        "required": ["authenticationInfo"]
      }
    }
  }</code></pre><p>I'm not entirely sure if that's all I'm doing? I think so from reading the docs. </p><p>Anyway I built this mostly for me. I have no idea if anybody else will enjoy it. But if you are bored I encourage you to give it a try. It should be pretty light weight and straight-forward if you crack open the extension and look at it. I'm not loading any analytics into the extension so basically until people complain about it, I don't really know if its going well or not. </p><h3 id="future-stuff">Future stuff</h3><ul><li>I need to sort stuff into categories so that you get more stuff in genres you like. I don't 100% know how to do that, maybe there is a way to scan a website to determine the "types" of content that is on there with machine learning? I'm still looking into it. </li><li>There's a lot of junk in there. I think if we reach a certain number of downvotes I might put it into a special "queue".  </li><li>I want to ensure new users see the "best stuff" early on but there isn't enough data to determine "best vs worst". </li><li>I wish there were more independent photography and science websites. Also more crafts. That's not really a "future thing", just me putting a hope out into the universe. Non-technical beta testers get overwhelmed by technical content. </li></ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The asteroid Bennu continues to provide new clues to scientists’ biggest questions about the formation of the early solar system and the origins of life. As part of the ongoing study of pristine samples delivered to Earth by NASA’s OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer) spacecraft, three new papers published Tuesday by the journals Nature Geosciences and Nature Astronomy present remarkable discoveries: sugars essential for biology, a gum-like substance not seen before in astromaterials, and an unexpectedly high abundance of dust produced by supernova explosions.</p>
<p><strong>Sugars essential to life</strong></p>
<p>Scientists led by Yoshihiro Furukawa of Tohoku University in Japan found sugars essential for biology on Earth in the Bennu samples, detailing their findings in the journal <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-025-01838-6" rel="noopener">Nature Geoscience</a>. The five-carbon sugar ribose and, for the first time in an extraterrestrial sample, six-carbon glucose were found. Although these sugars are not evidence of life, their detection, along with <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasas-asteroid-bennu-sample-reveals-mix-of-lifes-ingredients/">previous detections</a> of amino acids, nucleobases, and carboxylic acids in Bennu samples, show building blocks of biological molecules were widespread throughout the solar system.</p>
<p>For life on Earth, the sugars deoxyribose and ribose are key building blocks of DNA and RNA, respectively. DNA is the primary carrier of genetic information in cells. RNA performs numerous functions, and life as we know it could not exist without it. Ribose in RNA is used in the molecule’s sugar-phosphate “backbone” that connects a string of information-carrying nucleobases.</p>

<p>“All five nucleobases used to construct both DNA and RNA, along with phosphates, have already been found in the Bennu samples brought to Earth by OSIRIS-REx,” said Furukawa. “The new discovery of ribose means that all of the components to form the molecule RNA are present in Bennu.”</p>
<p>The discovery of ribose in asteroid samples is not a complete surprise. Ribose has previously been found in two <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/first-detection-of-sugars-in-meteorites-gives-clues-to-origin-of-life/">meteorites</a> recovered on Earth. What is important about the Bennu samples is that researchers did not find deoxyribose. If Bennu is any indication, this means ribose may have been more common than deoxyribose in environments of the early solar system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Researchers think the presence of ribose and lack of deoxyribose supports the “RNA world” hypothesis, where the first forms of life relied on RNA as the primary molecule to store information and to drive chemical reactions necessary for survival.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Present day life is based on a complex system organized primarily by three types of functional biopolymers: DNA, RNA, and proteins,” explains Furukawa. “However, early life may have been simpler. RNA is the leading candidate for the first functional biopolymer because it can store genetic information and catalyze many biological reactions.”</p>
<p>The Bennu samples also contained one of the most common forms of “food” (or energy) used by life on Earth, the sugar glucose, which is the first evidence that an important energy source for life as we know it was also present in the early solar system.</p>
<p><strong>Mysterious, ancient ‘gum’</strong></p>
<p>A second paper, in the journal <a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-025-02694-5" rel="noopener">Nature Astronomy</a> led by Scott Sandford at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley and Zack Gainsforth of the University of California, Berkeley, reveals a gum-like material in the Bennu samples never seen before in space rocks – something that could have helped set the stage on Earth for the ingredients of life to emerge. The surprising substance was likely formed in the early days of the solar system, as Bennu’s young parent asteroid warmed.</p>
<p>Once soft and flexible, but since hardened, this ancient “space gum” consists of polymer-like materials extremely rich in nitrogen and oxygen. Such complex molecules could have provided some of the chemical precursors that helped trigger life on Earth, and finding them in the pristine samples from Bennu is important for scientists studying how life began and whether it exists beyond our planet.</p>

<p>Bennu’s ancestral asteroid formed from materials in the solar nebula –  the rotating cloud of gas and dust that gave rise to the solar system –  and contained a variety of minerals and ices. As the asteroid began to warm, due to natural radiation, a compound called carbamate formed through a process involving ammonia and carbon dioxide. Carbamate is water soluble, but it survived long enough to polymerize, reacting with itself and other molecules to form larger and more complex chains impervious to water. This suggests that it formed before the parent body warmed enough to become a watery environment.</p>
<p>“With this strange substance, we’re looking at, quite possibly, one of the earliest alterations of materials that occurred in this rock,” said Sandford. “On this primitive asteroid that formed in the early days of the solar system, we’re looking at events near the beginning of the beginning.”</p>
<p>Using an infrared microscope, Sandford’s team selected unusual, carbon-rich grains containing abundant nitrogen and oxygen. They then began what Sandford calls “blacksmithing at the molecular level,” using the Molecular Foundry at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) in Berkeley, California. Applying ultra-thin layers of platinum, they reinforced a particle, welded on a tungsten needle to lift the tiny grain, and shaved the fragment down using a focused beam of charged particles.</p>

<p>When the particle was a thousand times thinner than a human hair, they analyzed its composition via electron microscopy at the Molecular Foundry and X-ray spectroscopy at Berkeley Lab’s Advanced Light Source. The ALS’s high spatial resolution and sensitive X-ray beams enabled unprecedented chemical analysis.</p>
<p>“We knew we had something remarkable the instant the images started to appear on the monitor,” said Gainsforth. “It was like nothing we had ever seen, and for months we were consumed by data and theories as we attempted to understand just what it was and how it could have come into existence.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team conducted a slew of experiments to examine the material’s characteristics. As the details emerged, the evidence suggested the strange substance had been deposited in layers on grains of ice and minerals present in the asteroid.</p>
<p>It was also flexible – a pliable material, similar to used gum or even a soft plastic. Indeed, during their work with the samples, researchers noticed the strange material was bendy and dimpled when pressure was applied. The stuff was translucent, and exposure to radiation made it brittle, like a lawn chair left too many seasons in the sun.</p>
<p>“Looking at its chemical makeup, we see the same kinds of chemical groups that occur in polyurethane on Earth,” said Sandford, “making this material from Bennu something akin to a ‘space plastic.’”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ancient asteroid stuff isn’t simply polyurethane, though, which is an orderly polymer. This one has more “random, hodgepodge connections and a composition of elements that differs from particle to particle,” said Sandford. But the comparison underscores the surprising nature of the organic material discovered in NASA’s asteroid samples, and the research team aims to study more of it.</p>
<p>By pursuing clues about what went on long ago, deep inside an asteroid, scientists can better understand the young solar system – revealing the precursors to and ingredients of life it already contained, and how far those raw materials may have been scattered, thanks to asteroids much like Bennu.</p>
<p><strong>Abundant supernova dust</strong></p>
<p>Another paper in the journal <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-025-02688-3" rel="noopener">Nature Astronomy</a>, led by Ann Nguyen of NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, analyzed presolar grains –&nbsp;dust from stars predating our solar system – found in two different rock types in the Bennu samples to learn more about where its parent body formed and how it was altered by geologic processes. It is believed that presolar dust was generally well-mixed as our solar system formed. The samples had six-times the amount of supernova dust than any other studied astromaterial, suggesting the asteroid’s parent body formed in a region of the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/science-highlights/finding-planetary-construction-zones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protoplanetary disk</a> enriched in the dust of dying stars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The study also reveals that, while Bennu’s parent asteroid experienced extensive alteration by fluids, there are still pockets of less-altered materials within the samples that offer insights into its origin.</p>

<p>“These fragments retain a higher abundance of organic matter and presolar silicate grains, which are known to be easily destroyed by aqueous alteration in asteroids,” said Nguyen. “Their preservation in the Bennu samples was a surprise and illustrates that some material escaped alteration in the parent body. Our study reveals the diversity of presolar materials that the parent accreted as it was forming.”</p>

<p>NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center provided overall mission management, systems engineering, and the safety and mission assurance for OSIRIS-REx. Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona, Tucson, is the principal investigator. The university leads the science team and the mission’s science observation planning and data processing. Lockheed Martin Space in Littleton, Colorado, built the spacecraft and provided flight operations. Goddard and KinetX Aerospace were responsible for navigating the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. Curation for OSIRIS-REx takes place at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. International partnerships on this mission include the OSIRIS-REx Laser Altimeter instrument from CSA (Canadian Space Agency) and asteroid sample science collaboration with JAXA’s (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s) Hayabusa2 mission. OSIRIS-REx is the third mission in NASA’s New Frontiers Program, managed by NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, for the agency’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington.</p>

                                        <p>KISUMU, Kenya (AP) — A high court in Kenya on Thursday declared unconstitutional sections of a seed law that prevented farmers from <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/kenya-seed-bank-agriculture-climate-b7169c77126e5c768e3c62653afbcdc1">sharing and selling indigenous seeds</a></span> in what food campaigners have called a landmark win for food security.</p><p>Farmers in Kenya could face up to two years’ imprisonment and a fine of 1 million Kenya shillings ($7,700) for sharing seeds through their community seed banks, according to a seed law signed in 2012.</p><p>Justice Rhoda Rutto on Thursday said sections of the seed law that gave government officials powers to raid seed banks and seize seeds were also unconstitutional.</p><p>The law was introduced as a measure to curb growing sale of counterfeit seeds that were causing loses in the agricultural sector and gave sole seed trading rights to licensed companies.</p><p>The case had been filed by 15 smallholder farmers, who are members of community seed banks that have been in operation for years, preserving and sharing seeds among colleagues.</p>
    
<p>A farmer, Samuel Wathome, who was among the 15, said the old farming practices had been vindicated.</p><p>“My grandmother saved seeds, and today the court has said I can do the same for my grandchildren without fear of the police or of prison,” he said.</p>



<p>Elizabeth Atieno, a food campaigner at Greenpeace Africa, called the win a “victory for our culture, our resilience, and our future.”</p><p>“By validating indigenous seeds, the court has struck a blow against the corporate capture of our food system. We can finally say that in Kenya, feeding your community with climate-resilient, locally adapted seeds is no longer a crime,” she said.</p>
    
    
    
<p>Food campaigners have in the past encouraged governments to work with farmers to preserve indigenous seeds as a way of ensuring food security by offering farmers more plant varieties.</p><p>Indigenous seeds are believed to be drought resistant and adaptable to the climate conditions of their native areas, and hence often outperform hybrid seeds.</p>
    
<p>Kenya has a national seed bank based near the capital Nairobi where indigenous seeds are stored in cold rooms, but farmers say community seed banks are equally important for variety and proximity to the farmer.</p><p>The country has faced challenges in the seed sector where counterfeit seeds were sold to farmers, leading to losses amounting to millions of shillings in a country that relies on rain-fed agriculture.</p>

   <p>The State Department is instructing its staff to reject visa applications from people who worked on fact-checking, content moderation or other activities the Trump administration considers "censorship" of Americans' speech.</p>   <p>The directive, sent in an internal memo on Tuesday, is focused on applicants for H-1B visas for highly skilled workers, which are frequently used by tech companies, among other sectors. The memo was first reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-orders-enhanced-vetting-applicants-h-1b-visa-2025-12-04/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>; NPR also obtained a copy.</p>

   <p>"I'm alarmed that trust and safety work is being conflated with 'censorship'," said Alice Goguen Hunsberger, who has worked in trust and safety at tech companies including OpenAI and Grindr.</p>   <p>"Trust and safety is a broad practice which includes critical and life-saving work to protect children and stop CSAM [child sexual abuse material], as well as preventing fraud, scams, and sextortion.

"Bad actors that target Americans come from all over the world and it's so important to have people who understand different languages and cultures on trust and safety teams — having global workers at tech companies in [trust and safety] absolutely keeps Americans safer."</p>   
   <p>In a statement, a State Department spokesperson who declined to give their name said the department does not comment on "allegedly leaked documents," but added: "the Administration has made clear that it defends Americans' freedom of expression against foreigners who wish to censor them. We do not support aliens coming to the United States to work as censors muzzling Americans."</p>   <p>The statement continued: "In the past, the President himself was the victim of this kind of abuse when social media companies locked his accounts. He does not want other Americans to suffer this way.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>



<p>Large language models (LMs) often struggle to generate diverse, human-like creative content, raising concerns about the long-term homogenization of human thought through repeated exposure to similar outputs. Yet scalable methods for evaluating LM output diversity remain limited, especially beyond narrow tasks such as random number or name generation, or beyond repeated sampling from a single model. To address this gap, we introduce Infinity-Chat, a large-scale dataset of 26K diverse, real-world, open-ended user queries that admit a wide range of plausible answers with no single ground truth. We introduce the first comprehensive taxonomy for characterizing the full spectrum of open-ended prompts posed to LMs, comprising 6 top-level categories (e.g., creative content generation, brainstorm &amp; ideation) that further breaks down to 17 subcategories. Using Infinity-Chat, we present a large-scale study of mode collapse in LMs, revealing a pronounced Artificial Hivemind effect in open-ended generation of LMs, characterized by (1) intra-model repetition, where a single model consistently generates similar responses, and more so (2) inter-model homogeneity, where different models produce strikingly similar outputs. Infinity-Chat also includes 31,250 human annotations, across absolute ratings and pairwise preferences, with 25 independent human annotations per example. This enables studying collective and individual-specific human preferences in response to open-ended queries. Our findings show that state-of-the-art LMs, reward models, and LM judges are less well calibrated to human ratings on model generations that elicit differing idiosyncratic annotator preferences, despite maintaining comparable overall quality. Overall, INFINITY-CHAT presents the first large-scale resource for systematically studying real-world open-ended queries to LMs, revealing critical insights to guide future research for mitigating long-term AI safety risks posed by the Artificial Hivemind.</p>



<p><strong>Reflections from the Selection Committee</strong></p>



<p>This paper makes a substantial and timely contribution to the understanding of diversity, pluralism, and societal impact in modern language models. The authors introduce Infinity-Chat, a rigorously constructed benchmark of 26K real-world open-ended queries paired with 31K dense human annotations, enabling systematic evaluation of creative generation, ideation, and subjective preference alignment, dimensions historically underexamined in AI evaluation. Beyond releasing a valuable dataset, the paper provides deep analytical insights through the first comprehensive taxonomy of open-ended prompts and an extensive empirical study across more than 70 models, revealing the Artificial Hivemind effect: pronounced intra- and inter-model homogenization that raises serious concerns about long-term risks to human creativity, value plurality, and independent thinking. The findings expose critical miscalibration between current reward models, automated judges, and diverse human preferences, highlighting the tension between alignment and diversity and establishing a foundation for future work on preserving heterogeneity in AI systems. Overall, this work sets a new standard for datasets and benchmarks that advance scientific understanding and address pressing societal challenges rather than solely improving technical performance.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>



<p>Gating mechanisms have been widely utilized, from early models like LSTMs and Highway Networks to recent state space models, linear attention, and also softmax attention. Yet, existing literature rarely examines the specific effects of gating. In this work, we conduct comprehensive experiments to systematically investigate gating-augmented softmax attention variants. Specifically, we perform a comprehensive comparison over 30 variants of 15B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models and 1.7B dense models trained on a 3.5 trillion token dataset. Our central finding is that a simple modification—applying a head-specific sigmoid gate after the Scaled Dot-Product Attention (SDPA)—consistently improves performance. This modification also enhances training stability, tolerates larger learning rates, and improves scaling properties. By comparing various gating positions and computational variants, we attribute this effectiveness to two key factors: (1) introducing non-linearity upon the low-rank mapping in the softmax attention, and (2) applying query-dependent sparse gating scores to modulate the SDPA output. Notably, we find this sparse gating mechanism mitigates massive activation, attention sink and enhances long-context extrapolation performance. We also release related codes (<a href="https://github.com/qiuzh20/gated_attention%7D">https://github.com/qiuzh20/gated_attention}</a>) and models (<a href="https://huggingface.co/QwQZh/gated_attention">https://huggingface.co/QwQZh/gated_attention</a>) to facilitate future research. Furthermore, the most effective SDPA output gating is used in the Qwen3-Next models (<a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen3-next">https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen3-next</a>).</p>



<p><strong>Reflections from the Selection Committee</strong></p>



<p>The main finding of this paper is that the performance of large language models using softmax attention can be consistently improved by introducing head-specific sigmoid gating after the scaled dot product attention operation in both dense and mixture-of-experts (MoE) Transformer models. This finding is backed up by more than thirty experiments on different variants of gated softmax attention using 15B MoE and 1.7B dense models trained on large-scale datasets of 400B, 1T, or 3.5T tokens. The paper also includes careful analyses showing that the introduction of the authors’ recommended form of gating improves the training stability of large language models, reduces the “attention sink” phenomenon that has been widely reported in attention models, and enhances the performance of context length extension. The main recommendation of the paper is easily implemented, and given the extensive evidence provided in the paper for this modification to LLM architecture, we expect this idea to be widely adopted. This paper represents a substantial amount of work that is possible only with access to industrial scale computing resources, and the authors’ sharing of the results of their work, which will advance the community’s understanding of attention in large language models, is highly commendable, especially in an environment where there has been a move away from open sharing of scientific results around LLMs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>



<p>Scaling up self-supervised learning has driven breakthroughs in language and vision, yet comparable progress has remained elusive in reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we study building blocks for self-supervised RL that unlock substantial improvements in scalability, with network depth serving as a critical factor. Whereas most RL papers in recent years have relied on shallow architectures (around 2 — 5 layers), we demonstrate that increasing the depth up to 1024 layers can significantly boost performance. Our experiments are conducted in an unsupervised goal-conditioned setting, where no demonstrations or rewards are provided, so an agent must explore (from scratch) and learn how to maximize the likelihood of reaching commanded goals. Evaluated on simulated locomotion and manipulation tasks, our approach increases performance on the self-supervised contrastive RL algorithm by&nbsp; — , outperforming other goal-conditioned baselines. Increasing the model depth not only increases success rates but also qualitatively changes the behaviors learned.</p>



<p><strong>Reflections from the Selection Committee</strong><strong><br></strong>This paper challenges the conventional assumption that the information provided by reinforcement learning (RL) is insufficient to effectively guide the numerous parameters of deep neural networks, hence suggesting that large AI systems be predominantly trained through self-supervision, with RL reserved solely for fine-tuning. The work introduces a novel and easy-to-implement RL paradigm for the effective training of very deep neural networks, employing self-supervised and contrastive RL. The accompanying analysis demonstrates that RL can scale efficiently with increasing network depth, leading to the emergence of more sophisticated capabilities. In addition to presenting compelling results, the study includes several useful analyses, for example, for highlighting the important role of batch size scaling for deeper networks within contrastive RL.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>



<p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of generative tasks. A key challenge is understanding the mechanisms that prevent their memorization of training data and allow generalization. In this work, we investigate the role of the training dynamics in the transition from generalization to memorization. Through extensive experiments and theoretical analysis, we identify two distinct timescales: an early time&nbsp; at which models begin to generate high-quality samples, and a later time&nbsp; beyond which memorization emerges. Crucially, we find that&nbsp; increases linearly with the training set size , while&nbsp; remaining constant. This creates a growing window of training times where models generalize effectively, despite showing strong memorization if training continues beyond it. It is only when it becomes larger than a model-dependent threshold that overfitting disappears at infinite training times. These findings reveal a form of implicit dynamical regularization in the training dynamics, which allows to avoid memorization even in highly overparameterized settings. Our results are supported by numerical experiments with standard U-Net architectures on realistic and synthetic datasets, and by a theoretical analysis using a tractable random features model studied in the high-dimensional limit.</p>



<p><strong>Reflections from the Selection Committee</strong></p>



<p>This paper presents foundational work on the implicit regularization dynamics of diffusion models, delivering a powerful result by unifying empirical observation with formal theory. The critical finding is the quantitative identification of two distinct, predictable timescales, an early, dataset-independent generalization phase followed by a linear, dataset-size-dependent memorization phase . This demonstration of an expanding window for effective generalization is not merely an empirical finding but is rigorously&nbsp; explained by deriving the spectral properties of the random features model using random matrix theory. By linking the practical success of diffusion models directly to a provable dynamical property (the implicit postponement of overfitting), the paper provides fundamental, actionable insight into the mechanisms governing modern generative AI, setting a new standard for analytical depth in the study of&nbsp; generalization.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>



<p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly in mathematics and programming tasks. It is widely believed that, similar to how traditional RL helps agents to explore and learn new strategies, RLVR enables LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities that exceed the capacity of the corresponding base models. In this study, we take a critical look at \textit{the current state of RLVR} by systematically probing the reasoning capability boundaries of RLVR-trained LLMs across diverse model families, RL algorithms, and math/coding/visual reasoning benchmarks, using pass@\textit{k} at large \textit{k} values as the evaluation metric. While RLVR improves sampling efficiency towards the correct path, we surprisingly find that current training does \emph{not} elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. We observe that while RLVR-trained models outperform their base models at smaller values of&nbsp; (\eg, =1), base models achieve higher pass@ score when&nbsp; is large. Moreover, we observe that the reasoning capability boundary of LLMs often narrows as RLVR training progresses. Further coverage and perplexity analysis shows that the reasoning paths generated by RLVR models are already included in the base models’ sampling distribution, suggesting that their reasoning abilities originate from and are \textit{bounded} by the base model. From this perspective, treating the base model as an upper bound, our quantitative analysis shows that six popular RLVR algorithms perform similarly and remain far from optimal in fully leveraging the potential of the base model. In contrast, we find that distillation can introduce new reasoning patterns from the teacher and genuinely expand the model’s reasoning capabilities. Taken together, our findings suggest that current RLVR methods have not fully realized the potential of RL to elicit genuinely novel reasoning abilities in LLMs. This underscores the need for improved RL paradigms—such as continual scaling and multi-turn agent-environment interaction—to unlock this potential.</p>



<p><strong>Reflections from the Selection Committee</strong></p>



<p>This paper delivers a masterfully executed and critically important negative finding&nbsp;on a widely accepted, foundational assumption in Large Language Model (LLM) research: that Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) elicits genuinely&nbsp;new&nbsp;reasoning capabilities. The paper shows that RLVR training, across various model families, tasks, and algorithms, enhances sampling efficiency without expanding the reasoning capacity already present in base models. RL narrows exploration, rewarded trajectories are amplified, but the broader solution space shrinks, revealing that RLVR optimizes within, rather than beyond, the base distribution. This is an important finding which will hopefully incentivize fundamentally new RL paradigms able to navigate the vast action space and&nbsp; genuinely expand LLM reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>



<p>We resolve a 30-year-old open problem concerning the power of unlabeled data in online learning by tightly quantifying the gap between transductive and standard online learning. We prove that for every concept class&nbsp; with Littlestone dimension , the transductive mistake bound is at least . This establishes an exponential improvement over previous lower bounds of , , and , respectively due to Ben-David, Kushilevitz, and Mansour (1995, 1997) and Hanneke, Moran, and Shafer (2023). We also show that our bound is tight: for every , there exists a class of Littlestone dimension&nbsp; with transductive mistake bound . Our upper bound also improves the previous best known upper bound from Ben-David et al. (1997). These results demonstrate a quadratic gap between transductive and standard online learning, thereby highlighting the benefit of advanced access to the unlabeled instance sequence. This stands in stark contrast to the PAC setting, where transductive and standard learning exhibit similar sample complexities.</p>



<p><strong>Reflections from the Selection Committee</strong></p>



<div><p>This paper presents a breakthrough in learning theory, deserving the NeurIPS Best Paper Runner-Up award for its elegant, comprehensive, and definitive resolution of a 30-year-old open problem. The authors have not only precisely quantified the optimal mistake bound for transductive online learning as Ω(√d), but they have also achieved a tight match with an O(√d) upper bound. This establishes a quadratic gap between transductive and standard online learning, a result that represents an exponential leap beyond all previous logarithmic lower bounds and dramatically highlights the theoretical value of unlabeled data in this setting—a crucial insight distinct from its more limited role in PAC learning.</p><p>The novelty and ingenuity of their proof techniques are quite remarkable. For the lower bound, the adversary employs a sophisticated strategy that balances forcing mistakes with carefully managing the shrinking of the version space, leveraging the concept of “paths in trees” as a fundamental underlying structure. The upper bound, demonstrating the learnability within O(√d) mistakes, introduces an innovative hypothesis class construction that embeds a “sparse encoding” for off-path nodes – a probabilistic design where most off-path labels are zero, but the rare ones carry immense information. The learner’s strategy to exploit this class is equally brilliant, integrating several non-standard sophisticated techniques: “Danger Zone Minimization” to control the instance sequence presented by the adversary, “Splitting Experts” via a multiplicative weights approach to handle uncertainty about a node’s on-path status, and a strategic “Transition to Halving” once sufficient information is gathered from the sparsely encoded off-path labels. This intricate interplay between a cleverly constructed hypothesis class and a highly adaptive learning algorithm showcases a masterclass in theoretical analysis and design.</p></div>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>



<p>The success of today’s large language models (LLMs) depends on the observation that larger models perform better. However, the origin of this neural scaling law, that loss decreases as a power law with model size, remains unclear. We propose that representation superposition, meaning that LLMs represent more features than they have dimensions, can be a key contributor to loss and cause neural scaling. Based on Anthropic’s toy model, we use weight decay to control the degree of superposition, allowing us to systematically study how loss scales with model size. When superposition is weak, the loss follows a power law only if data feature frequencies are power-law distributed. In contrast, under strong superposition, the loss generically scales inversely with model dimension across a broad class of frequency distributions, due to geometric overlaps between representation vectors. We confirmed that open-sourced LLMs operate in the strong superposition regime and have loss scaling inversely with model dimension, and that the Chinchilla scaling laws are also consistent with this behavior. Our results identify representation superposition as a central driver of neural scaling laws, providing insights into questions like when neural scaling laws can be improved and when they will break down.</p>



<p><strong>Reflections from the Selection Committee:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>This paper moves beyond observation of neural scaling laws—the empirically established phenomenon in which model loss exhibits a power-law decrease as model size, dataset size, or computational resources are increased—to demonstrate that representation superposition constitutes the primary mechanism governing these laws. Authors introduce a controlled “toy model” to examine how superposition and data structure affect the scaling of loss with model size and demonstrate that under strong superposition where features are overlapping, the loss scales consistently as an inverse power law with respect to the model dimension. The core findings are supported by a series of carefully designed experiments and offer fresh insights into an important research area.</p>







<p>The selection of these papers reflects the remarkable breadth of research presented at NeurIPS 2025, spanning generative modeling, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, learning theory, neural scaling, and benchmarking methodologies. The diversity of topics among the awarded papers demonstrates the vibrant and multifaceted nature of machine learning research.</p>

<p>2021 &gt; PHEV BMW iBMUCP PHEV Post-Crash Recovery — When EU engineering becomes a synonym for “unrepairable” + “generating waste”.</p>



<p>If you own a BMW PHEV — or if you’re an insurance company — every pothole, every curb impact, and even every rabbit jumping out of a bush represents a potential €5,000 cost, just for a single fuse inside the high-voltage battery system.<br>This “safety fuse” is designed to shut the system down the moment any crash event is detected. Sounds safe — but extremely expensive. Theoraticaly insurance for BMW PHEV should be 3x higher than ICE or EV</p>



<p>Unfortunately, that’s not the only issue.</p>



<p>BMW has over-engineered the diagnostic procedure to such a level that even their own technicians often do not know the correct replacement process. And it gets worse: the original iBMUCP module, which integrates the pyrofuse, contactors, BMS and internal copper-bonded circuitry, is fully welded shut. There are no screws, no service openings, and it is not designed to be opened, even though the pyrofuse and contactors are technically replaceable components. Additionally, the procedure requires flashing the entire vehicle both before and after the replacement, which adds several hours to the process and increases risk of bricked components which can increase the recovery cost by factor 10x.</p>



<p>But that is still not the only problem.</p>



<p>Even after we managed to open the unit and access everything inside, we discovered that the Infineon TC375 MCU is fully locked. Both the D-Flash sectors and crash-flag areas are unreadable via DAP or via serial access.<br>Meaning: even if you replace the pyrofuse, you still cannot clear the crash flag, because the TC375 is cryptographically locked.</p>



<p>This leaves only one method:<br>➡️ Replace the entire iBMUCP module with a brand-new one. (1100€ + tax for faulty fuse)</p>



<p>And the registration of the new component is easily one of the worst procedures we have ever seen. You need an ICOM, IMIB, and AOS subscription — totalling over €25,000 in tools — just to replace a fuse. (even we managed to activate this one with IMIB, it will be necessary in some situation)<br>Yes, you read that correctly, 25,000€</p>



<p>Lot of vehicles designed and produced in Europe — ICE, PHEV, and EV — have effectively become a missleading ECO exercise. Vehicles marketed as “CO₂-friendly” end up producing massive CO₂ footprints through forced services, throw-away components, high failure rates and unnecessary parts manufacturing cycles, overcomplicated service procedures, far larger than what the public is told. If we are destroying our ICE automotive industry based on EURO norms, who is calculating real ECO footprint of replacement part manucfacturing, unecessary servicing and real waste cost?</p>



<p>We saw this years ago on diesel and petrol cars:<br>DPF failures, EGR valves, high-pressure pumps, timing belts running in oil, low quality automatic transmissions, and lubrication system defects. Everyone calculates the CO₂ footprint of a moving vehicle — nobody calculates the CO₂ footprint of a vehicle that is constantly broken and creating waste.</p>



<p>ISTA’s official iBMUCP replacement procedure is so risky that if you miss one single step — poorly explained within ISTA — the system triggers ANTITHEFT LOCK.<br>This causes the balancing controller to wipe and lock modules.<br>Meaning: even in an authorised service centre, system can accidentally delete the configuration and end up needing not only a new iBMUCP, but also all new battery modules.</p>



<p>Yes — replacing a fuse can accidentally trigger the replacement of all healthy HV modules, costing €6,000+ VAT per module, plus a massive unknown CO₂ footprint.<br>This has already happened to several workshops in the region.</p>



<p>The next problem: BMW refuses to provide training access for ISTA usage. We submitted two official certification requests — both were rejected by the central office in Austria, which is borderline discriminatory.</p>



<p>One more next problem: Battery erasal can happen in OEM and can happen in our or any other 3rd party workshop, but if procedure was started in workshop 1, it cant be continued in workshop 2. If battery damage happens in our workshop during fuse change, and than battery swap needed, we or even OEM workshop do not cover costs of completely new battery pack. Which increases heavily ownership costs.</p>



<p>All of this represents unnecessary complexity with no meaningful purpose.<br>While Tesla’s pyrofuse costs €11 and the BMS reset is around 50€, allowing the car to be safely restored, BMW’s approach borders on illogical engineering, with no benefit to safety, no benefit to anti-theft protection — the only outcome is the generation of billable labour hours and massive amounts of needless electronic/lithium waste.</p>



<p>Beyond that, we are actively working on breaking the JTAG/DAP protection to gain direct access to the D-Flash data and decrypt its contents together with our colleagues from Hungary. The goal is to simplify the entire battery-recovery procedure, reduce costs, and actually deliver the CO₂ reduction that the EU keeps missleading— since the manufacturers clearly won’t.</p>

  <p>Clickjacking is a classic attack that consists of covering up an iframe of some other website in an attempt to trick the user into unintentionally interacting with it. It works great if you need to trick someone into pressing a button or two, but for anything more complicated it’s kind of unrealistic.</p>
<p>I’ve discovered a new technique that turns classic clickjacking on its head and enables the creation of complex interactive clickjacking attacks, as well as multiple forms of data exfiltration.</p>
<p>I call this technique “<strong>SVG clickjacking</strong>”.</p>

<!--## Liquid glaCSS-->
<h2 id="liquid-svgs">Liquid SVGs</h2>
<p>The day Apple announced its new Liquid Glass redesign was pretty chaotic. You couldn’t go on social media without every other post being about the new design, whether it was critique over how inaccessible it seemed, or awe at how realistic the refraction effects were.</p>
<p>Drowning in the flurry of posts, a thought came to mind - how hard would it be to re-create this effect? Could I do this, on the web, without resorting to canvas and shaders? I got to work, and about an hour later I had <a href="https://codepen.io/rebane2001/details/OPVQXMv">a pretty accurate CSS/SVG recreation of the effect</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><em>You can drag around the effect with the <span id="liquidResize"><span>bottom-right circle control thing</span></span> in the demo above (chrome/firefox desktop, chrome mobile).</em></p>
<p><span>Note: This demo is broken in Safari, sorry.</span></p>
<p>My little tech demo made quite a splash online, and even resulted in a <a href="https://80.lv/articles/accurate-apple-s-liquid-glass-effect-recreated-with-css-svg">news article</a> with what is probably the wildest quote about me to date: <em>“Samsung and others have nothing on her”</em>.</p>
<p>A few days passed, and another thought came to mind - would this SVG effect work on top of an iframe?</p>
<p>Like, surely not? The way the effect “refracts light”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> is way too complex to work on a cross-origin document.</p>
<p>But, to my surprise, it did.</p>
<p>The reason this was so interesting to me is that my liquid glass effect uses the <code>feColorMatrix</code> and <code>feDisplacementMap</code> SVG filters - changing the colors of pixels, and moving them, respectively. And I could do that on a cross-origin document?</p>
<p>This got me wondering - do any of the other filters work on iframes, and could we turn that into an attack somehow? It turns out that it’s <!--nearly -->all of them, and yes!</p>
<h2 id="building-blocks">Building blocks</h2>
<p>I got to work, going through every <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element#f">&lt;fe*&gt;</a> SVG element and figuring out which ones can be combined to build our own attack primitives.</p>
<p>These filter elements take in one or more input images, apply operations to them, and output a new image. You can chain a bunch of them together within a single SVG filter, and refer to the output of any of the previous filter elements in the chain.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some of the more useful base elements we can play with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/feImage"><strong>&lt;feImage&gt;</strong></a> - load an image file;</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/feFlood"><strong>&lt;feFlood&gt;</strong></a> - draw a rectangle;</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/feOffset"><strong>&lt;feOffset&gt;</strong></a> - move stuff around;</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/feDisplacementMap"><strong>&lt;feDisplacementMap&gt;</strong></a> - move pixels according to a map;</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/feGaussianBlur"><strong>&lt;feGaussianBlur&gt;</strong></a> - blur stuff;</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/feTile"><strong>&lt;feTile&gt;</strong></a> - tiling and cropping utility;</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/feMorphology"><strong>&lt;feMorphology&gt;</strong></a> - expand/grow light or dark areas;</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/feBlend"><strong>&lt;feBlend&gt;</strong></a> - blend two inputs according to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/blend-mode">mode</a>;</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/feComposite"><strong>&lt;feComposite&gt;</strong></a> - compositing utilities, can be used to apply an alpha matte, or do various arithmetics on one or two inputs;</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/feColorMatrix"><strong>&lt;feColorMatrix&gt;</strong></a> - apply a color matrix, this allows moving colors between channels and converting between alpha and luma mattes;</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s quite a selection of utilities!</p>
<p>If you’re a demoscener<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> you’re probably feeling right at home. These are  the fundamental building blocks for many kinds of computer graphics, and they can be combined into many useful primitives of our own. So let’s see some examples.</p>
<h3 id="fake-captcha">Fake captcha</h3>
<p>I’ll start off with an example of basic data exfiltration. Suppose you’re targeting an iframe that contains some sort of sensitive code. You <em>could</em> ask the user to retype it by itself, but that’d probably seem suspicious.</p>
<p>What we can do instead is make use of <code>feDisplacementMap</code> to make the text seem like a captcha! This way, the user is far more likely to retype the code.</p>

<p>Add to this some <span id="color-effects-hover">color effects and random lines</span>, and you’ve got a pretty convincing cap<span>-</span>tcha!</p>
<p>Out of all the attack primitives I’ll be sharing, this one is probably the least useful as sites rarely allow you to frame pages giving out magic secret codes. I wanted to show it though, as it’s a pretty simple introduction to the attack technique.</p>

<art-frame aria-label="an API response made to look like one from Google's services" role="figure">)]}'

<p>Still, it could come in handy because often times you’re allowed to frame read-only API endpoints, so maybe there’s an attack there to discover.</p>
<h3 id="grey-text-hiding">Grey text hiding</h3>
<p>The next example is for situations where you want to trick someone into, for example, interacting with a text input. Oftentimes the inputs have stuff like grey placeholder text in them, so showing the input box by itself won’t cut it.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at our example target (try typing in the box).</p>
<art-frame flex=""><fake-frame><div><p>Set a new p​assword</p><p><span>too short</span></p></div></fake-frame></art-frame>

<p>In this example we want to trick the user into setting an attacker-known password, so we want them to be able to see the text they’re entering, but not the grey placeholder text, nor the red “too short” text.</p>
<p>Let’s start off by using <code>feComposite</code> with arithmetics to make the grey text disappear. The <code>arithmetic</code> operation takes in two images, <code>i1</code> (<code>in=...</code>) and <code>i2</code> (<code>in2=...</code>), and lets us do per-pixel maths with <code>k1</code>, <code>k2</code>, <code>k3</code>, <code>k4</code> as the arguments according to this formula: <math><mi>r</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>k</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>i</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>i</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>k</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>i</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>k</mi><mn>3</mn></msub><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>i</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>k</mi><mn>4</mn></msub></math><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>

</code></pre>

<p><em>Tip! You can leave out the in/in2 parameters if you just want it to be the previous output.</em></p>
<p>It’s getting there - by multiplying the brightness of the input we’ve made the grey text disappear, but now the black text looks a little suspicious and hard to read, especially on 1x scaling displays.</p>
<p>We <em>could</em> play around with the arguments to find the perfect balance between hiding the grey text and showing the black one, but ideally we’d still have the black text look the way usually does, just without any grey text. Is that possible?</p>
<p>So here’s where a really cool technique comes into play - masking. We’re going to create a matte to “cut out” the black text and cover up everything else. It’s going to take us quite a few steps to get to the desired result, so lets go through it bit-by-bit.</p>
<p>We start off by cropping the result of our black text filter with <code>feTile</code>.</p>
<art-frame flex=""><fake-frame><div><p>Set a new p​assword</p><p><span>too short</span></p></div></fake-frame></art-frame>
<pre><code><sx-t>&lt;feTile</sx-t> <sx-r>x</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>20</sx-v> <sx-r>y</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>56</sx-v> <sx-r>width</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>184</sx-v> <sx-r>height</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>22</sx-v> <sx-t>/&gt;</sx-t>
</code></pre>

<p>Note: Safari seems to be having some trouble with <code>feTile</code>, so if <span>the examples flicker or look blank, read this post in a browser such as Firefox or Chrome. If</span> you're writing an attack for Safari, you can also achieve cropping by making a luma matte with <code>feFlood</code> and then applying it.</p>
<p>Then we use <code>feMorphology</code> to increase the thickness of the text.</p>
<art-frame flex=""><fake-frame><div><p>Set a new p​assword</p><p><span>too short</span></p></div></fake-frame></art-frame>
<pre><code><sx-t>&lt;feMorphology</sx-t> <sx-r>operator</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>erode</sx-v> <sx-r>radius</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>3</sx-v> <sx-r>result</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>thick</sx-v> <sx-t>/&gt;</sx-t>
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have to increase the contrast of the mask. I’m going to do it by first using <code>feFlood</code> to create a solid white image, which we can then <code>feBlend</code> with <code>difference</code> to invert our mask. And then we can use <code>feComposite</code> to multiply<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> the mask for better contrast.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>We have a luma matte now! All that’s left is to convert it into an alpha matte with <code>feColorMatrix</code>, apply it to the source image with <code>feComposite</code>, and make the background white with <code>feBlend</code>.</p>

<p>Looks pretty good, doesn’t it! If you empty out the box (try it!) you might notice some artifacts that give away what we’ve done, but apart from that it’s a pretty good way to sort of sculpt and form various inputs around a bit for an attack.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of other effects you can add to make the input seem just right. Let’s combine everything together into a complete example of an attack.</p>

<h3 id="pixel-reading">Pixel reading</h3>
<p>And now we come to what is most likely the most useful attack primitive - pixel reading. That’s right, you can use SVG filters to read color data off of images and perform all sorts of logic on them to create really advanced and convincing attacks.</p>
<p>The catch is of course, that you’ll have to do everything within SVG filters - there is no way to get the data out<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Despite that, it is very powerful if you get creative with it.</p>
<p>On a higher level, what this lets us do is make everything in a clickjacking attack responsive - fake buttons can have hover effects, pressing them can show fake dropdowns and dialogs, and we can even have fake form validation.</p>
<p>Let’s start off with a simple example - detecting if a pixel is pure black, and using it to turn another filter on or off.</p>

<p>Let’s start off by using two copies of the <code>feTile</code> filter to first crop out the few pixels we’re interested in and then tile those pixels across the entire image.</p>

<p>The solution is pretty simple - we can simply use <code>feBlend</code>’s difference combined with a <code>feColorMatrix</code> to join the color channels to turn the image into a similar black/white matte as before. For textures we can use <code>feImage</code>, and for non-exact colors we can use a bit of <code>feComposite</code>’s arithmetic to make the matching threshold more lenient.</p>
<p>And that’s it, a simple example of how we can read a pixel value and use it to toggle a filter.</p>

This means that we can program anything we want, as long as it is not timing-based<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> and doesn’t take up too many resources<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>These logic gates are what modern computers are made of. You could build a computer within an SVG filter if you wanted to. In fact, here’s a basic calculator I made:</p>



<p>This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_%28electronics%29#Full_adder">full adder</a> circuit. This filter implements the logic gates <math><mi>S</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>⊕</mo><mi>B</mi><mo>⊕</mo><msub><mi>C</mi><mi>in</mi></msub></math> for the output and <math><msub><mi>C</mi><mi>out</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>∧</mo><mi>B</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>∨</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>C</mi><mi>in</mi></msub><mo>∧</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>⊕</mo><mi>B</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></math> for the carry bit using the logic gates described above. There are more efficient ways to implement an adder in SVG filters, but this is meant to serve as proof of the ability to implement arbitrary logic circuits.</p>

<p>Anyways, for an attacker, what all of this means is that you can make a multi-step clickjacking attack with lots of conditions and interactivity. And you can run logic on data from cross-origin frames.</p>

<p>This is an example target where we want to trick the user into marking themselves as hacked, which requires a few steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking a button to open a dialog</li>
<li>Waiting for the dialog to load</li>
<li>Clicking a checkbox within the dialog</li>
<li>Clicking another button in the dialog</li>
<li>Checking for the red text that appeared</li>

  <p>2. Wait 3 seconds</p>

  </div>
</fake-frame>

<p>A traditional clickjacking attack against this target would be difficult to pull off. You’d need to have the user click on multiple buttons in a row with no feedback in the UI.</p>
<p>There are some tricks you could do to make a traditional attack more convincing than what you see above, but it’s still gonna look sketch af. And the moment you throw something like a text input into the mix, it’s just not gonna work.</p>
<p>Anyways, let’s build out a logic tree for a filter-based attack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the dialog open?
<ul>
<li><em>(No)</em> Is the red text present?
<ul>
<li><em>(No)</em> Make the user press the button</li>
<li><em>(Yes)</em> Show the end screen</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>(Yes)</em> Is the dialog loaded?
<ul>
<li><em>(No)</em> Show loading screen</li>
<li><em>(Yes)</em> Is the checkbox checked?
<ul>
<li><em>(No)</em> Make the user check the checkbox</li>
<li><em>(Yes)</em> Make the user click the button</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Which can be expressed in logic gates<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inputs
<ul>
<li><strong>D</strong> (dialog visible) = check for background dim</li>
<li><strong>L</strong> (dialog loaded) = check for the button in dialog</li>
<li><strong>C</strong> (checkbox checked) = check whether the button is blue or grey</li>
<li><strong>R</strong> (red text visible) = <code>feMorphology</code> and check for red pixels</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Outputs
<ul>
<li>(¬<strong>D</strong>) ∧ (¬<strong>R</strong>) =&gt; button1.png</li>
<li><strong>D</strong> ∧ (¬<strong>L</strong>) =&gt; loading.png</li>
<li><strong>D</strong> ∧ <strong>L</strong> ∧ (¬<strong>C</strong>) =&gt; checkbox.png</li>
<li><strong>D</strong> ∧ <strong>L</strong> ∧ <strong>C</strong> =&gt; button2.png</li>
<li>(¬<strong>D</strong>) ∧ <strong>R</strong> =&gt; end.png</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  <p>Welcome to this secure application!</p>

<p><label>Show attack with transparency</label></p>

<p>Play around with this and see just how much more convincing it is as an attack. And we could easily make it better by, for example, adding some extra logic to also add hover visuals to the buttons. The demo has debug visuals for the four inputs (D, L, C, R) in the bottom left as squares to make it easier to understand what’s going on.</p>
<p>But yeah, that’s how you can make complex and long clickjacking attacks that have not been realistic with the traditional clickjacking methods.</p>
<p>I kept this example here pretty short and simple, but real-world attacks can be a lot more involved and polished.</p>
<p>In fact…</p>
<h2 id="the-docs-bug">The Docs bug</h2>
<p>I’ve actually managed to pull off this attack against Google Docs!</p>
<p>Take a look at the demo videos <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@rebane2001/115265287713185877">here</a> (alt links: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rebane2001.bsky.social/post/3lzo4euxo5s2p">bsky</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rebane2001/status/1971213061580259814">twitter</a>).</p>
<p>What this attack does is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Makes the user click on the “Generate Document” button</li>
<li>Once pressed, detects the popup and shows a textbox for the user to type a “captcha” into
<ul>
<li>The textbox starts off with a gradient animation, which must be handled</li>
<li>The textbox has focus states, which must also be present in the attack visuals, so they must be detected by the background color of the textbox</li>
<li>The textbox has grey text for both a placeholder AND suggestions, which must be hidden with the technique discussed earlier</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the captcha is typed, makes the user seemingly click on a button (or press enter), which causes a suggested Docs item to be added into the textbox
<ul>
<li>This item must be detected by looking for its background color in the textbox</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the item is detected, the textbox must be hidden and another button must be shown instead
<ul>
<li>Once that button is clicked, a loading screen appears, which must be detected</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the loading screen is present, or the dialog is not visible and the “Generate Document” button is not present, the attack is over and the final screen must be shown</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past, individual parts of such an attack could’ve been pulled off through traditional clickjacking and some basic CSS, but the entire attack would’ve been way too long and complex to be realistic. With this new technique of running logic inside SVG filters, such attacks become realistic.</p>
<p>Google VRP awarded me <span>$3133.70</span> for the find. That was, of course, <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@rebane2001/115349916882356842">right before</a> they introduced a novelty bonus for new vulnerability classes. Hmph!<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>
<!--
Should be something like opening the settings, scrolling down to the desired item, selecting it, then selecting the thing on the side and typing something in.

maybe add in a loading spinner or something too that we can pixel detect

maybe it could be like generating an app password or something like that

the scrolling down could be a license agreement spoof
the typing something should be a captcha spoof

<h2 id="the-qr-attack">The QR attack</h2>
<p>Something I see in online discussions often is the insistence on QR codes being dangerous. It kind of rubs me the wrong way because QR codes are not any more dangerous than links.</p>
<p>I don’t usually comment on this too much because it’s best to avoid suspicious links, and the same goes for QR codes, but it does nag me to see people make QR codes out to be this evil thing that can somehow immediately hack you.</p>
<p>I turns out though, that my SVG filters attack technique can be applied to QR codes as well!</p>
<p>The example from earlier in the blog with retyping a code becomes impractical once the user realizes they’re typing something they shouldn’t. We can’t stuff the data we exfiltrate into a link either, because an SVG filter cannot create a link.</p>
<p>But since an SVG filter can run logic and provide visual output, perhaps we could generate a QR code with a link instead?</p>
<h3 id="creating-the-qr">Creating the QR</h3>
<p>Creating a QR code within an SVG filter is easier said than done however. We can shape binary data into the shape of a QR code by using <code>feDisplacementMap</code>, but for a QR code to be scannable it also needs error correction data.</p>
<p>QR codes use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction">Reed-Solomon error correction</a>, which is some fun math stuff that’s a bit more advanced than a simple checksum. It does math with polynomials and stuff and that is a bit annoying to reimplement in an SVG.</p>
<p>Luckily for us, I’ve faced the same problem before! Back in 2021 I was the first person<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> to <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/rebane-s-qr-code-generator/">make a QR code generator in Minecraft</a>, so I’ve already figured out the things necessary.</p>
<p>In my build I pre-calculated some lookup tables for the error correction, and used those instead to make the build simpler - and we can do the same with the SVG filter.</p>
<p>This post is already getting pretty long, so I’ll leave figuring out how this filter works as an exercise to the reader ;).</p>

</qr-gen>
</qr-demo><p>Hover to see QR</p></art-frame>



<p>This is a demo that displays a QR code telling you how many seconds you’ve been on this page for. It’s a bit fiddly, so if it doesn’t work make sure that you aren’t using any <bad-scaling>display scaling</bad-scaling> or <bad-color>a custom color profile</bad-color>. On Windows you can toggle the <em>Automatically manage color for apps</em> setting, and on a Mac you can set the color profile to sRGB for it to work.</p>
<p>This demo <bad-phone>does not work on mobile devices</bad-phone>. And also, for the time being, <fire-fox>it only works in Chromium-based browsers</fire-fox>, but I believe it could be made to work in Firefox too.</p>
<p>Similarly, in a real attack, the scaling and color profile issues could be worked around using some JavaScript tricks or simply by implementing the filter a bit differently - this here is just a proof of concept that’s a bit rough around the edges.</p>
<p>But yeah, that’s a QR code generator built inside an SVG filter!</p>
<p>Took me a while to make, but I didn’t want to write about it just being “theoretically possible”.</p>
<h3 id="attack-scenario">Attack scenario</h3>
<p>So the attack scenario with the QR code is that you’d read pixels from a frame, process them to extract the data you want, encode them into a URL that looks something like <em>https://lyra.<span>horse</span>/?ref=c3VwZXIgc2VjcmV0IGluZm8</em> and render it as a QR code.</p>
<p>Then, you prompt the user to scan the QR code for whatever reason (eg anti-bot check). To them, the URL will seem like just a normal URL with a tracking ID or something in it.</p>
<p>Once the user opens the URL, your server gets the request and receives the data from the URL.</p>
<h2 id="and-so-on">And so on..</h2>
<p>There are so many ways to make use of this technique I won’t have time to go over them all in this post. Some examples would be reading text by using the difference blend mode, or exfiltrating data by making the user click on certain parts of the screen.</p>
<p>You could even insert data from the outside to have a fake mouse cursor inside the SVG that shows the <span><i>pointer</i> cursor</span> and reacts to fake buttons inside your SVG to make the exfiltration more realistic.</p>
<p>Or you could code up attacks with CSS and SVG where CSP doesn’t allow for any JS.</p>
<p>Anyways, this post is long as is, so I’ll leave figuring out these techniques as homework.</p>
<h2 id="novel-technique">Novel technique</h2>
<p>This is the first time in my security research I’ve found a completely new technique!</p>
<p>I introduced it briefly at <a href="https://youtu.be/INgS4IipEhU?t=1516">my BSides talk in September</a>, and this post here is a more in-depth overview of the technique and how it can be used.</p>
<p>Of course, you can never know 100% for sure that a specific type of attack has never been found by anyone else, but my extensive search of existing security research has come up with nothing, so I suppose I can crown myself as the researcher who discovered it?</p>
<p>Here’s some previous research I’ve found:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-018-0423-3">You click, I steal: analyzing and detecting click hijacking attacks in web pages</a>,<br>
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot12/woot12-final16.pdf">On the fragility and limitations of current Browser-provided Clickjacking
protection schemes</a>
<ul>
<li>The papers mention SVG filters in clickjacking attacks, but only in the context of obscuring the underlying elements, not running logic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Stone-Pixel-Perfect-Timing-Attacks-with-HTML5-WP.pdf">Pixel Perfect Timing - Attacks with HTML5</a>,<br>
<a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40077679">
Security: SVG Filter Timing Attack</a>
<ul>
<li>Research on reading pixels through SVG filter timing attacks, which is a technique that is mitigated in modern browsers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://ronmasas.com/posts/the-human-side-channel">The Human Side Channel</a>
<ul>
<li>Some pretty cool clickjacking techniques, though no multi-step attacks or SVG logic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tom-p-reichel/svg-is-turing-complete">SVG is turing-complete-ish</a>
<ul>
<li>Another example of logic gates in SVG I found after writing my blog. It’s fun because it comes with <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/d4xcgs/svg_is_turing_complete/">reddit</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20980837">hn</a> threads - I particularly like the comment asking about whether this turing completeness is useful or just a fun fact, which got a reply confirming the latter. <span>I like turning fun facts into vulnerabilities ^^.</span></li>
<li>Note that whether SVG filters are actually turing complete is questionable because filters are implemented in constant-time and can’t run in a loop. This doesn’t mean they can’t be turing complete, but it also doesn’t prove that they are.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t think <em>me</em> discovering this technique was just luck though. I have a history of seeing things such as CSS as programming languages to exploit and be creative with. It wasn’t a stretch for me to see SVG filters as a programming language either.</p>
<p>That, and my overlap between security research and creative projects - I often blur the lines between the two, which is what <a href="https://lyra.horse/antonymph/">Antonymph</a> was born out of.</p>
<p id="aws">In any case, <s-l>it feels</s-l> <span><m-m>

<p>whoa this post took such a long time for me to get done!</p>
<p>i started work on it in july, and was expecting to release it alongside <a href="https://youtu.be/INgS4IipEhU">my CSS talk</a> in september, but it has taken me so much longer than expected to actually finish this thing. i wanted to make sure it was a good in-depth post, rather than something i just get out as soon as possible.</p>
<p>unlike my previous posts, i did unfortunately have to break my trend of using no images, since i needed a few data URIs within the SVG filters for demos. still, no images anywhere else in the post, no javascript, and just 42kB (gzip) of handcrafted html/css/svg.</p>
<p>also, i usually hide a bunch of easter eggs in my post that link to stuff i’ve enjoyed recently, but i have a couple links i didn’t want to include without content warnings. <a href="https://youtu.be/UBdBoWAtLNI">finding responsibility</a> is a pretty dark talk about the ethics of making sure your work won’t end up killing people, and <a href="https://youtu.be/rQHYelsNgtU">youre the one ive always wanted</a> is slightly nsfw doggyhell vent art.</p>
<p>btw i’ll soon be giving talks at <a href="https://events.ccc.de/en/category/39c3/">39c3</a> and <a href="https://disobey.fi/2026/">disobey 2026</a>! the 39c3 one is titled “<a href="https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2025/fahrplan/event/css-clicker-training-making-games-in-a-styling-language">css clicker training</a>” and will be about css crimes and making games in css. and the disobey one is the same talk as the bsides one about using css to hack stuff and get bug bounties, but i’ll make sure to throw some extra content in there to keep it fun.</p>
<p>see y’all around!!</p>
