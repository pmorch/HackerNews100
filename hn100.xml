<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true" aria-labelledby="file-name-id-wide file-name-id-mobile"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why wordfreq will not be updated</h2><a id="user-content-why-wordfreq-will-not-be-updated" aria-label="Permalink: Why wordfreq will not be updated" href="#why-wordfreq-will-not-be-updated"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The wordfreq data is a snapshot of language that could be found in various
online sources up through 2021. There are several reasons why it will not be
updated anymore.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Generative AI has polluted the data</h2><a id="user-content-generative-ai-has-polluted-the-data" aria-label="Permalink: Generative AI has polluted the data" href="#generative-ai-has-polluted-the-data"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I don't think anyone has reliable information about post-2021 language usage by
humans.</p>
<p dir="auto">The open Web (via OSCAR) was one of wordfreq's data sources. Now the Web at
large is full of slop generated by large language models, written by no one to
communicate nothing. Including this slop in the data skews the word
frequencies.</p>
<p dir="auto">Sure, there was spam in the wordfreq data sources, but it was manageable and
often identifiable. Large language models generate text that masquerades as
real language with intention behind it, even though there is none, and their
output crops up everywhere.</p>
<p dir="auto">As one example, <a href="https://pshapira.net/2024/03/31/delving-into-delve/" rel="nofollow">Philip Shapira
reports</a> that ChatGPT
(OpenAI's popular brand of generative language model circa 2024) is obsessed
with the word "delve" in a way that people never have been, and caused its
overall frequency to increase by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Information that used to be free became expensive</h2><a id="user-content-information-that-used-to-be-free-became-expensive" aria-label="Permalink: Information that used to be free became expensive" href="#information-that-used-to-be-free-became-expensive"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">wordfreq is not just concerned with formal printed words. It collected more
conversational language usage from two sources in particular: Twitter and
Reddit.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Twitter data was always built on sand. Even when Twitter allowed free
access to a portion of their "firehose", the terms of use did not allow me to
distribute that data outside of the company where I collected it (Luminoso).
wordfreq has the frequencies that were built with that data as input, but the
collected data didn't belong to me and I don't have it anymore.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now Twitter is gone anyway, its public APIs have shut down, and the site has
been replaced with an oligarch's plaything, a spam-infested right-wing cesspool
called X. Even if X made its raw data feed available (which it doesn't), there
would be no valuable information to be found there.</p>
<p dir="auto">Reddit also stopped providing public data archives, and now they sell their
archives at a price that only OpenAI will pay.</p>
<p dir="auto">And given what's happening to the field, I don't blame them.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">I don't want to be part of this scene anymore</h2><a id="user-content-i-dont-want-to-be-part-of-this-scene-anymore" aria-label="Permalink: I don't want to be part of this scene anymore" href="#i-dont-want-to-be-part-of-this-scene-anymore"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">wordfreq used to be at the intersection of my interests. I was doing corpus
linguistics in a way that could also benefit natural language processing tools.</p>
<p dir="auto">The field I know as "natural language processing" is hard to find these days.
It's all being devoured by generative AI. Other techniques still exist but
generative AI sucks up all the air in the room and gets all the money. It's
rare to see NLP research that doesn't have a dependency on closed data
controlled by OpenAI and Google, two companies that I already despise.</p>
<p dir="auto">wordfreq was built by collecting a whole lot of text in a lot of languages.
That used to be a pretty reasonable thing to do, and not the kind of thing
someone would be likely to object to. Now, the text-slurping tools are mostly
used for training generative AI, and people are quite rightly on the defensive.
If someone is collecting all the text from your books, articles, Web site, or
public posts, it's very likely because they are creating a plagiarism machine
that will claim your words as its own.</p>
<p dir="auto">So I don't want to work on anything that could be confused with generative AI,
or that could benefit generative AI.</p>
<p dir="auto">OpenAI and Google can collect their own damn data. I hope they have to pay a
very high price for it, and I hope they're constantly cursing the mess that
they made themselves.</p>

<p>Bear with me till the end.</p>

<p>I work in the same office as Anna, EY Pune and in the same cluster. </p>

<p>The death of Anna was informed via a centralised mail in which they attached her linkedin picture with some standard short message like RIP. News was put in the grapevine that she was already suffering from a health condition which got worse. </p>

<p>Though I haven't worked directly with her, I've worked with her manager, who is worse than how it's portrayed in the letter. He actually prioritises his convenience (like cricket) and he doesn't really care for anyone's time or effort. He proudly bought IPL final tickets in deadline at exorbitant prices and showed off on insta. He takes all the credit himself, and blames the team for any shortfalls (classic manager behaviour). Boasts all day everyday. When he reviews your work, his focus is not on the correctness of work, he points out as many mistakes as he could, depicting how smart he is, and in other words how dumb you are.</p>

<p>Her assistant manager, she's atrocious. Basically what the asst manager does is distribute work to the team and follow up from each one. Ensure no one is stress free, no one is taking time off. Basically they highlight their potential by getting work done from lesser people (like work of 5/6 resources from 2 resources) in order to get promoted. It is said in common language that you can trust and deal with a drunken man out of his mind, but not an AM. Every AM is the embodiment of this statement.</p>

<p>I have been working in EY for quite some time now, and I have seen people come and go. People who come here (generally) are very hardworking people who have thirst for learning and they are ready to work day and night. Australian timings, European timings, US timings, you name it. Seasoned people exploit these newcomers like anything. And these senior people have power. Good deal of power. They can make your life a living hell if you don't co-operate with them. Try reporting to HR, then you'll get to know he's part of this structure too. They have the audacity to use profane language in reviews. Newly qualified CAs and articles come all the way from their states like Kashmir, Punjab, TN, sacrificing everything just to learn and get good exposure. But it's a bloodbath.  All these people are school toppers of their time. It seems apparent that years of mind numbing toil wasn't enough.They're humiliated to an extent where they lose their respect in their own eyes. Humiliation in the team calls is quite normal here. And these newcomers are from small families who teach them to respect elders and not react to any unreasonable behaviour, not to say NO to any work, give your heart and soul to the work you do. Everyone of us went through this thinking maybe something is wrong with me, if everyone is able to handle this pressure I should handle it too. Female employees may get some leniency but for our male colleagues it's absolutely brutal. Everyone is tortured to hell. No social life, no personal time, no time to attend even phone calls. Most of the newcomers including articles quit, some endure the trouble for some years and then quit, remaining become managers and become trouble for others.</p>

<p>We average 16 hours a day in the busy season, and 12 hours a day in non busy seasons. No weekends or public holidays are off. Annually EY voluntarily announces a day off to rejuvenate their employees. And yes you guessed it right! Even that is not off. We work on that day as well - from Office! Overwork is the only way to get promoted, do and make others do it. </p>

<p>Top level people (Partners) don't care about sh<em>t. You don't even get to interact with partners until you're at least an asst manager. They don't give a f</em>*k about any employee, they just care about getting work done. Even if you go through boiling hell and get the work done, you won't get any acknowledgement from anyone forget about appreciation. One of my colleagues was hospitalized suffering from Dengue, and these people made him make workpapers from his hospital bed. Good for him he quit then and there. When I say these people are inhuman, they literally are.</p>

<p>People leaving EY are usually very happy, and their colleagues congratulate them like they are being released from prison. </p>

<p>It's my request to all my colleagues reading this message - please reevaluate your priorities, see what you're really doing to yourself. And to CAs and articles who dream to work in such an organisation - be very careful of what you wish for.</p>

<p>Anna's death has impacted us all. And such letter from Augustine is a conclusive evidence that "already suffering from health issues" was an deliberately created rumour. Hope the effort behind this letter doesn't go in vain. </p>

<p>Support from all suffering employees of EY.</p>

<p>More power to you Augustine.</p>

<p>We don’t typically think of dental cavities as a chronic disease—in part because of the separation between medicine and dentistry—but it is. And it doesn’t just affect children: most adults in industrialized countries, where sugary food is commonly available, have to deal with this disease process.</p>

<p>I write the word “cavity,” but the phrase “dental caries” is actually more encompassing. First documented in&nbsp;<u><a href="https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merriam-webster.com%2Fdictionary%2Fcaries&amp;data=05%7C02%7Chaleh.cohn%40mail.mcgill.ca%7Cf03015f21ece403afee108dc75da1eef%7Ccd31967152e74a68afa9fcf8f89f09ea%7C0%7C0%7C638514826885498770%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=fV6hWm531mY5HNCQA%2BOggVL5LPnX%2Bz3lcHYc0E7KwWY%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="//www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/caries. Click or tap if you trust this link.">1634</a></u>&nbsp;and coming from the Latin meaning “to decay,” caries refers to the process that can eventually lead to a hole in a tooth, an actual cavity.</p>

<p>Few people enjoy going to the dentist and being told to reduce their sugar consumption. So, what if there was a pain-free way of avoiding dental caries forever? There is a product you can buy right now that essentially—through interviews and social media endorsements—promises to do just that. It’s a bacterium that you paint onto your teeth. It superinfects your mouth, taking over for the bacteria responsible for caries. A single application lasts a lifetime.</p>

<p>There is, however, a big problem with this product, called Lumina, and it has to do with what happens when we become so focused on a potential solution, dedicating our life to making it work, that we miss important changes in our understanding of the problem itself.</p>

It looked like some sort of mutated version of a streptococcus, so he named it&nbsp;<i>Streptococcus mutans</i>, or&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>for short.</p>

<p>A few decades later,&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>had established itself in the minds of the scientific community as the great culprit behind dental caries, what experts call its etiology, meaning its cause. The bacterium was able to stick to the surface of our teeth and, in processing the sugars in our mouth, it would produce large amounts of acid, specifically lactic acid. Normally, our saliva is able to neutralize a lot of this acid, but&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>secretes complex sugars that create a sort of film over our teeth called plaque, trapping its acid underneath. Over time, the tooth, eroded by the acid, would cavitate and develop a hole.</p>

<p>In the late 1970s, however, a chance event would promise to change the game.

This opened the door to&nbsp;<i>replacement therapy</i>. A destructive approach to the problem of dental carries would be to use an antibiotic to kill the culprit; with replacement therapy, the idea is to&nbsp;<i>replace&nbsp;</i>the culprit with a version of it that is harmless.

Could we colonize the human mouth with this naturally mutated&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>and thus bid goodbye to cavities?</p>

<p>A good replacement strain, it turns out, needs to meet a number of criteria, not unlike the robots of Isaac Asimov’s fictional universe which had to abide by the Laws of Robotics. The chosen bacterium must not cause disease, obviously. It should not predispose us to other diseases by disrupting the bacterial ecosystem that exists in our mouth. It has to stay in the mouth for a long time and ensure that the bacterium it is replacing doesn’t grow back. And because mutations do arise naturally, it has to be genetically stable: it should not be able to regain the ability to produce massive amounts of acid by picking up the gene from a neighbouring bacterium (which does happen in the wild!). Figuring out that the mutated&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>did not fulfill all of these criteria and finding a strain that did led Hillman and colleagues down a very long path.</p>

<p>For a few decades, they laboured to find (or engineer) a strain of&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>that apparently checked all of the right boxes.

The toxicity of this Mutacin-1140 compound had not been tested. What would be the consequences of millions of bacteria in the mouth releasing this compound? The answer wasn’t clear, even though the archetypal compound in the family Mutacin-1140 belonged to was known to be very safe. BCS3-L1 also had the possibility to disturb the microbiome in the mouth in ways that were not predicted and allow disease-causing microorganisms to grow and thrive. And the fact that this bacterium did not produce acid could theoretically be reversed if it acquired the gene from a neighbouring bacterium.</p>

<p>Still, a new drug application was filed with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and thus began a decade of back-and-forth. The FDA wanted a big red “abort” button in case something went wrong, a way to kill BCS3-L1.

<p>Caries occur because of a catastrophic shift in the balance of our mouth’s bacterial and fungal ecosystem. It is not due to any one bacterium, and any bacterium capable of releasing acid after ingesting sugars can contribute to this. Even if you could reliably stop&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>from producing acid, you could not guarantee the absence of future dental caries. The reason why&nbsp;<i>S. mutans&nbsp;</i>became the Big Bad of the 1970s dentistry world is because researchers were stuck studying the mouth bacteria they could grow in the laboratory, and&nbsp;<i>S. mutans</i>grows well in the conditions scientists were selecting back then.

<p>We are thus left with a product, Lumina, that cannot guarantee the prevention of future caries and whose safety can be summarized by a giant question mark. Is the Mutacin-1140 it releases into the mouth safe in the long term? Can the bacterium be transmitted to a partner via kissing? Is it safe in people with a compromised immune system?

But in terms of what works to reduce the chances of a dentist announcing you have a cavity, it’s fairly straightforward: reduce your sugar consumption and use a toothpaste that contains fluoride. Our teeth are constantly in the midst of getting demineralized and remineralizing themselves. The acid produced by bacteria in the mouth interferes with remineralization, but the presence of fluoride helps those precious minerals diffuse into the tooth to form new crystals and thus protect the tooth from cavities. That’s why fluoride is so good for our teeth.</p>

<p>Or you could paint your teeth with an experimental bacterium and see what happens.</p>

<p><strong>Take-home message:</strong><br>
	- Lumina is a genetically engineered version of the Streptococcus mutans bacterium that lives in the mouth, and it is supposed to prevent you from developing dental caries because it does not produce acid<br>
	- It has been poorly studied for safety and effectiveness<br>
	- Streptococcus mutans is actually neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of dental caries; the disease actually comes about because of a shift in the equilibrium of bacteria in the mouth which encourages the demineralization of our teeth</p>

We believe the Special Committee and the Board have provided ample time for you to submit such a proposal.

The Special Committee is therefore unwilling to consider further extensions, and the Board agrees with the Special Committee’s determination.</p>  <p>While we continue to wholeheartedly support the Company’s mission and believe deeply in the value of the personalized health and wellness offering that you have articulated, it is also clear that we differ on the strategic direction for the Company going forward. Because of that difference and because of your concentrated voting power, we believe that it is in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders that we resign from the Board rather than have a protracted and distracting difference of view with you as to the direction of the Company.</p>  <p>We are proud of what 23andMe has achieved in pioneering direct access to genetic information, and we have been honored to have had the opportunity to be part of those efforts.</p>  <p>Sincerely,</p>  <p>/s/</p>  <p>Roelof Botha, Patrick Chung, Sandra Hernández, M.D., Neal Mohan, Valerie Montgomery Rice M.D., Richard Scheller, Ph.D., Peter J.

    <p>Coming from JavaScript, Rust, C, or any other high-level language, looking at assembly snippets can be confusing or even scary.</p>

<p>Let’s take the following snippet:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>section</span> <span>.data</span>
  <span>msg</span> <span>db</span> <span>"Hello, World!"</span>

<span>section</span> <span>.text</span>
  <span>global</span> <span>_start</span>

<span>_start:</span>
  <span>mov</span> <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>mov</span> <span>rdi</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>mov</span> <span>rsi</span><span>,</span> <span>msg</span>
  <span>mov</span> <span>rdx</span><span>,</span> <span>13</span>
  <span>syscall</span>

  <span>mov</span> <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>60</span>
  <span>mov</span> <span>rdi</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span>
  <span>syscall</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Thankfully the second line gives away what this does.</p>

<p>None of the bread and butter of programming as we know it is here: conditionals and loops are nowhere to be seen, there is no way to create functions… heck, variables don’t even have names!</p>

<p>Where does one even start?</p>

<p>This little introduction is meant to introduce you, somebody with programming experience, to the world of assembly. We’ll discuss the basics of the language and map them to high-level programming constructs.</p>

<p>By the end of this guide, you will be able to navigate assembly code, know where to look for information, and even write some simple programs all by yourself.</p>

<p>Let’s get started!</p>

<h2 id="hello-world">Hello world</h2>

<p>Unsurprisingly, our first program will be a “Hello World”.</p>

<p>Before jumping into the code though, we need to briefly introduce the language we’ll be using. At the end of this section, we will be able to write and run our first assembly program.</p>

<h3 id="x86-64-assembly">x86-64 assembly</h3>

<p>First things first, assembly is not a language.</p>

<p>Assembly refers to a <em>family of programming languages</em> featuring instructions that closely map to the machine code that the CPU will execute. In fact, one of the raisons d’etre of assembly languages is to provide a human-readable version of machine code in situations like reverse engineering, hardware programming, or developing games for consoles.</p>

<p>In this guide, we will use <em>x86-64 assembly</em> which can be assembled and executed on most personal computers. This choice should ease running and tinkering with the snippets along the way.</p>

<p>For historical reasons, there are two “flavors” of the x64-64 assembly syntax: one called <em>Intel</em> and the other is called <em>AT&amp;T</em><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In this guide we will stick to the <em>Intel</em> dialect because it’s used by the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html">Intel Software Developer Manuals (SDM)</a>, the source of truth on what the CPU <em>really</em> does when fed an instruction.</p>

<p>Assembly is all about working close to the hardware. Optimizimg for portability of the code examples across operative systems and architactures would obfuscate the content of this introduction.</p>

<p>The snippets we will be written for Linux, and they should run fine on Window’s WSL as well. The general concepts and practices are nonetheless valid regardless of your OS of choice.</p>

<h3 id="anatomy-of-an-instruction">Anatomy of an instruction</h3>

<p>Instructions are the way we tell the CPU what to do. They look something like this:</p>



<p>They represent the smallest unit of assembly language and are mostly composed of two parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>mnemonic</strong>: a shortened word or sentence that specifies the operation to be performed</li>
  <li><strong>operands</strong>: a list of 0-3 items representing what’s affected by the operation</li>
</ul>

<p>In our example, the mnemonic is <code>mov</code>, which stands for <em>move</em>, and the operands are <code>rax</code> and <code>rbx</code>. This instruction in plain English would read: move the content of <code>rbx</code> in <code>rax</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>

  <p><code>rax</code> and <code>rbx</code> are registers and we will introduce them in the next paragraph. In the meantime, you can imagine them as variables holding a value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some instructions will have more then mnemonic and operands. Additional parts such as <em>prefixes</em> and <em>size directives</em> will only be needed later, and we’ll talk through them at the right moment.</p>

<p>Fear not, there is no need to memorize all the possible instructions now. Whenever we’ll come across new operations, we will discuss them, and with repetition you will remember in no time.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html">Intel Software Developer Manuals (SDM)</a> will be our instruction reference in the next chapters. Keep it handy!</p>

<h3 id="storing-data-registers">Storing data: Registers</h3>

<p>You can think of registers as storage space baked right into the CPU itself. They are small and incredibly fast to access.</p>

<p>The most common registers are the so-called <em>general purpose</em> registers. In x86-64 they are sixteen in total, and they are 64 bits wide.</p>

<p>One can access the whole register or a subset by using different names. For example, using <code>rax</code> (as in the code above) would address all the 64 bits in the <code>rax</code> register. With <code>al</code>, you can access the lower byte of the same register.</p>

¹: 2 bytes are sometimes called words (hence the w suffix)

</sup></p>

<p>General purpose means that they can store anything in principle. In practice, we’ll see that some registers have special meanings, some instructions only use certain registers, and some conventions dictate who is expected to write where.</p>

<p>The only non-general-purpose register we will be concerned with is <code>rip</code> the <em>instruction pointer</em> register. It holds the address of the next instruction to execute, and therefore, modifying <code>rip</code> allows programs to jump to arbitrary instructions in the code.</p>

<h3 id="our-first-assembly-file">Our first assembly file</h3>

<p>Assembly files typically have an <code>.s</code> or <code>.asm</code> extension and they are split in three sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>data</strong>: where we define constants and initialized variables;</li>
  <li><strong>bss</strong>: where we define non-initialized variables;</li>
  <li><strong>text</strong>: where we will type our code, this is the only mandatory section of the file.</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code><span>section</span> <span>.data</span>
  <span>; constants here</span>

<span>section</span> <span>.bss</span>
  <span>; variables here</span>

<span>section</span> <span>.text</span>
  <span>; code here</span>
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>

  <p>The semicolon <code>;</code> is the comment character: whatever comes after it will not be executed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assembly programs run as you would expect. They start with the first instruction and sequentially execute one instruction after the other, from top to bottom. To create control flow, such as conditionals and loops, we make our programs ‘jump’ to specific instructions. We will look at jumps in detail in the next sections.</p>

<p>Just as you’d use a <code>main</code> function in many high-level languages, assembly requires us to specify an entry point for our program. We do this using the <code>global</code> declaration, which points to a <em>label</em>.</p>

<p>Labels are the assembly’s way of giving human-readable names to specific instructions. They serve two purposes: making our code more understandable and allowing us to reference these instructions elsewhere in our program. You can declare a label by writing it followed by a colon, like this: <code>label:</code>. When you want to reference a label (for example, in a jump instruction), use it without the colon: <code>label</code>.</p>

<p>Typically, <code>global</code> references a <code>_start</code> label declared immediately after it. That is where our program will start executing.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>section</span> <span>.data</span>
  <span>; constants here</span>

<span>section</span> <span>.bss</span>
  <span>; variables here</span>

<span>section</span> <span>.text</span>
  <span>global</span> <span>_start</span>
<span>_start:</span>
  <span>; instructions here</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="at-last-hello-world">At last, “Hello World”</h3>

<p>Finally, we have all the tools to build software in assembly. Very Nice!</p>

<p>Our program will use two system calls: <code>sys_write</code> to print characters in a terminal and <code>exit</code> to terminate the process with a given status code.</p>

<p>Using syscalls goes like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>select the syscall to invoke by moving its identifier in <code>rax</code></li>
  <li>pass arguments to the syscall by populating appropriate registers</li>
  <li>use the <code>syscall</code> instruction to fire the call</li>
</ul>

<p>The only other instruction we will use is <code>mov</code> which we have seen in the instruction paragraph. It works pretty much like an assignment (the <code>=</code> operator) in many high-level languages: it moves the content of the second operand into the first operand.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the code to see how this plays together.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Coding along</strong></p>

  <p>Throughout this series, we’ll use an embedded editor to tinker with the code and run the examples as we go. The same content can be found in the sibling repository <a href="https://github.com/shikaan/x86-64-asm-intro">shikaan/x86-64-asm-intro</a> if you want to run locally.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>We have a “hello world”!</p>

<p>In this first article, we learned some basic assembly concepts, we cut our teeth on its syntax, and we even wrote some working software. Moreover, we explored how to communicate with the operative system and are ready to produce more interesting programs <a href="https://shikaan.github.io/assembly/x86/guide/2024/09/16/x86-64-conditionals.html">in the next article</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-19065">

<p>I wrote a decade ago about the <a href="https://conversableeconomist.com/2014/07/16/double-irish-dutch-sandwich/" title="">Double Irish Dutch Sandwich</a>, a strategy for corporations to evade taxes that was widespread and large-scale enough to come to the attention of the International Monetary Fund. But due to various changes in national and international tax agreements, the strategy seems to have faded substantially. Ana Maria Santacreu and&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Samuel Moore  of the St. Louis Fed provide some background in “<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2024/aug/unpacking-discrepancies-american-irish-royalty-reporting" title="">Unpacking Discrepancies in American and Irish Royalty Reporting</a>” (August 08, 2024). </p>



<p>For those who don’t keep up to speed on the details of international tax evasion schemes, Santacreu and Moore describe the Double Irish Dutch Sandwich works like this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich tax scheme, as illustrated in the third figure, involved a complex arrangement between a U.S. parent company (USP) and three foreign subsidiaries. The first Irish subsidiary (I1) was incorporated in Ireland but managed from Bermuda, allowing it to avoid both Irish and U.S. taxes. The second Irish subsidiary (I2) was incorporated and managed in Ireland. The purpose of I2 is to control foreign distribution and collect income. A Dutch subsidiary (N) acted as an intermediary between I2 and I1 to avoid Irish taxes.</p>



<p>The scheme worked by exploiting specific provisions in Irish and U.S. tax laws. A USP would transfer intellectual property ownership to I1. Then, I2 would sublicense the intellectual property from I1 and pay royalties. These royalties would flow from I2 to N, and then from N to I1, taking advantage of European Union tax regulations. This structure allowed profits to be shifted to tax havens like Bermuda, effectively minimizing tax liabilities for the entire corporate structure.</p>

<p>However, a combination of Irish tax reforms in 2015 and changes in the <a href="https://conversableeconomist.com/2024/08/12/us-tax-policy-the-coming-storm-in-2025/" title="">US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 </a>made this strategy ineffective: “Consequently, Irish companies began paying royalties directly to American parent companies instead of routing them through tax havens.”</p>



<p>The shifts in royalty payments tell the story. This figure shows royalty payments by Irish companies to the US, which doubled from since 2019 to 2021. </p>

<p>Conversely, tax payments from Ireland and from Netherlands to Bermuda, well-known for it’s near-zero corporate taxes, went way down–showing a decilne in corporate profits being routed through Bermuda. </p>

<p>I’m sure the international tax lawyers around the world are strategizing new tax evasion strategies even as I write these words. But it’s worth remembering that there are two large costs at play here. The obvious loss is to government revenue, but the more subtle and still very real loss is the diversion of high-powered talent from what could have been gains in efficiency and productivity to focus instead on corporate reorganizations and tax evasion games. </p>

<p>When you enter a hostname in your web browser (e.g., apple.com), that name must first be translated into an IP address so your computer can connect to the server. This lookup is usually performed unencrypted, meaning your Internet provider and other parties monitoring your connection can see which sites you visit. To protect these lookups from prying eyes, Little Snitch 6 offers a new feature: DNS encryption. With DNS encryption enabled, all name lookups are routed through Little Snitch and performed in encrypted form.</p>
<p>For this purpose, Little Snitch registers a DNS proxy. macOS then sends <strong>all</strong> DNS requests to that proxy, which in turn performs the lookup in encrypted form. The key point here is that <strong>all</strong> requests must be routed through the proxy.</p>
<h2>But…</h2>
<p>While investigating a DNS-related issue on macOS 15 Sequoia, we discovered that some DNS requests—particularly those made via certain low-level legacy APIs—were not being received by our proxy!</p>
<p>There appears to be a bug in macOS Sequoia causing <strong>some</strong> requests to bypass the installed DNS proxy and be sent unencrypted to the system’s default name server instead.</p>
<p>Note that this bug likely affects any kind of DNS proxy, not just Little Snitch.</p>
<p>So, if you rely on the new DNS encryption feature of Little Snitch 6, or if you are using another third-party DNS proxy, be aware that some DNS lookups may bypass the proxy until Apple provides a fix in a future macOS update.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> DNS lookups performed via higher-level APIs do not appear to be affected by this bug. For example, your web-browsing in Safari or Chrome still fully benefits from encrypted lookups. Firefox, on the other hand, does seem to be affected.</p>
<h2>How to Reproduce</h2>
<ol>
<li>Enable DNS encryption in Little Snitch &gt; Settings.</li>
<li>Start <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> with a capture filter for <code>port 53</code>.</li>
<li>Run the following code in an Xcode playground:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>import Foundation

let domain = "dnsproxytest.com"
var result: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;addrinfo&gt;?
let status = getaddrinfo(domain, nil, nil, &amp; result)</code></pre>
<p>You will notice that the lookup for <code>dnsproxytest.com</code> can be seen in Wireshark in unencrypted form on UDP port 53 (the default for unencrypted lookups).</p>
<p>Additionally, you will see that Little Snitch Network Monitor does not display any traffic for the lookup because the lookup completely bypasses the network filter!</p>
<p>We have reported this bug to Apple and hope for a fix soon. Please stay tuned, we will keep you updated here.</p>
<h2>Update 2024-09-17, 7:10 p.m.</h2>
<p>After further investigation, we found that this bug has already existed at least since macOS 14.5 Sonoma (maybe even earlier, but we currently don’t have access to an older 14.x system for testing).</p></section>

  <p>We’re delighted to announce the general availability of Swift 6. This is a major new release that expands Swift to more platforms and domains.</p>

<p>Many people know of Swift as a language for app development, with a million apps on the App Store. But Swift is great for more than just apps. Swift’s safety, speed, and approachability make it a great choice for many other use cases including libraries, internet-scale services, and the most performance-critical and secure code.</p>

<p>Swift 6 scales even further through new low-level programming features, an embedded Swift language subset, expanded Linux and Windows support, new cross-platform APIs including the new Swift Testing library, and more.</p>

<p>Read on for a deep dive into changes to the language, standard libraries, debugging, platform support, and next steps for getting started with Swift 6.</p>

<h2 id="language-and-standard-library">Language and Standard Library <a title="Permalink for Language and Standard Library section" href="#language-and-standard-library">
            <!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?--> 
          </a></h2>



<p>Swift has long offered memory safety, ensuring that variables are initialized before they’re used, memory isn’t accessed after it’s been deallocated, and array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors.  Swift 6 now includes a new, opt-in language mode that extends Swift’s safety guarantees to prevent data races in concurrent code by diagnosing potential data races in your code as compiler errors.</p>

<p>Data-race safety checks were previously available as warnings in Swift 5.10 through the <code>-strict-concurrency=complete</code> compiler flag. Thanks to improved <code>Sendable</code> inference and new compiler analysis for transferring mutable state from one actor to another, Swift 6 warnings about data-race safety have fewer false positives. You can find more information about the Swift 6 language mode and how to migrate at <a href="http://swift.org/migration">Swift.org/migration</a>.</p>

<p>Swift 6 marks the start of the journey to make data-race safety dramatically easier. The usability of data-race safety remains an area of active development, and your feedback will help shape future improvements.</p>

<p>Swift 6 also comes with a new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/synchronization">Synchronization library</a> for low-level concurrency APIs, including atomic operations and a new mutex API.</p>



<p>Swift 6 enables functions to specify the type of error that they throw as part of their signature. This feature is useful in generic code that forwards along errors thrown in client code, or in resource-constrained environments that cannot allocate memory, such as in embedded Swift code.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>parseRecord</span><span>(</span><span>from</span> <span>string</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span><span>(</span><span>ParseError</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Record</span> <span>{</span> 
  <span>// ... </span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>A call to <code>parseRecord(from:)</code> will either return a <code>Record</code> instance or throw an error of type <code>ParseError</code>. A <code>do..catch</code> block will infer <code>ParseError</code> as the type of the <code>error</code> variable:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>do</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>record</span> <span>=</span> <span>try</span> <span>parseRecord</span><span>(</span><span>from</span><span>:</span> <span>myString</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// 'error' has type 'ParseError'</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Typed throws generalizes over throwing and non-throwing functions. A function that is specified as <code>throws</code> (without a specific error type) is equivalent to one that specifies <code>throws(any Error)</code>, whereas a non-throwing function is equivalent to one that specifies <code>throws(Never)</code>. Calls to functions that are <code>throws(Never)</code> are non-throwing and don’t require error handling at the call site.</p>

<p>Typed throws can also be used in generic functions to propagate error types from parameters, in a manner that is more precise than <code>rethrows</code>. For example, the <code>Sequence.map</code> method can propagate the thrown error type from its closure parameter, indicating that it only throws the same type of errors as the closure:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>extension</span> <span>Sequence</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>func</span> <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>_</span> <span>body</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>Element</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span><span>(</span><span>E</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span><span>(</span><span>E</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>T</span><span>]</span> <span>{</span> 
    <span>// ... </span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When given a closure that throws <code>ParseError</code>, <code>map</code> will throw <code>ParseError</code>. When given a non-throwing closure, <code>E</code> is inferred to <code>Never</code> and <code>map</code> will not throw.</p>



<p>Swift 5.9 introduced non-copyable types with the <code>~Copyable</code> syntax for modeling resources with unique ownership, and writing performance-conscious code by eliminating the runtime overhead associated with copying. Swift 6 now supports these types with the generics system, making it possible to write generic code that works with both copyable and non-copyable types.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>protocol</span> <span>Drinkable</span><span>:</span> <span>~Copyable</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>consuming</span> <span>func</span> <span>use</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Coffee</span><span>:</span> <span>Drinkable</span><span>,</span> <span>~Copyable</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* ... */</span> <span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Water</span><span>:</span> <span>Drinkable</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* ... */</span> <span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>drink</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>:</span> <span>consuming</span> <span>some</span> <span>Drinkable</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>~Copyable</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>item</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>drink</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>:</span> <span>Coffee</span><span>())</span>
<span>drink</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>:</span> <span>Water</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>Drinkable</code> protocol has no requirement that its conforming types are <code>Copyable</code>. This means both the non-copyable type <code>Coffee</code> and copyable type <code>Water</code> can be passed into the generic <code>drink</code> function.</p>

<p>Switch statements can now be written to avoid copying within enum pattern-matching operations. This means that switch statements can be used with non-copyable payloads and can also provide performance benefits for copyable payloads, especially those based on copy-on-write containers like <code>Array</code> and <code>Dictionary</code>.</p>

<p>Non-copyable types are already used throughout the standard libraries. For instance, the new <code>Atomic</code> type in the Synchronization library is based on <code>~Copyable</code>, <code>Optional</code> and <code>Result</code> can now wrap non-copyable types, and the unsafe buffer pointer types can now point to non-copyable elements. C++ interoperability also uses non-copyable types to expose C++ move-only types to Swift.</p>



<p>Swift 5.9 introduced bidirectional interoperability with C++ to seamlessly bring Swift to more existing projects. Swift 6 expands interoperability support to C++ move-only types, virtual methods, default arguments, and more standard library types including <code>std::map</code> and <code>std::optional</code>.</p>

<p>C++ types that do not have a copy constructor can now be accessed from Swift 6 as non-copyable types with <code>~Copyable</code>. And for those times when it’s useful to expose a C++ type with a copy constructor as <code>~Copyable</code> in Swift for better performance, a new <code>SWIFT_NONCOPYABLE</code> annotation can be applied to the C++ type.</p>

<p>Swift now also supports calls of C++ virtual methods on types annotated as <code>SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE</code> or <code>SWIFT_IMMORTAL_REFERENCE</code>.</p>

<p>When calling C++ functions or methods that have default argument values for some of their parameters, Swift now respects these default values, rather than requiring you to explicitly pass an argument.</p>



<p>Swift 6 includes a preview of <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/visions/embedded-swift.md">Embedded Swift</a>, a language subset and compilation mode suitable for embedded software development, such as programming microcontrollers. The toolchain supports ARM and RISC-V bare-metal targets.</p>

<p>Embedded Swift produces small and standalone binaries by relying on generic specialization. Since it doesn’t rely on a runtime or type metadata, Embedded Swift is suitable for platforms with tight memory constraints as well as use in low-level environments with limited runtime dependencies.</p>

<p>Embedded Swift remains an experimental feature, with ongoing development before stable support in a future Swift release.</p>



<p>Swift 6 rounds out the set of low-level integer primitives with the addition of signed and unsigned <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0425-int128.md">128-bit integer types</a>. These are available on all Swift platforms, and provide the same API as other fixed-width integer types in the standard library.</p>



<p>Swift 6 introduces a number of productivity enhancements, including <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sequence/count(where:)"><code>count(where:)</code></a> to streamline counting the number of elements in a sequence that satisfy a predicate, <a href="https://www.swift.org/blog/pack-iteration/">pack iteration</a> for writing natural <code>for</code>-loops over the elements in a value parameter pack, access control for imports to keep implementation details from leaking into your public APIs, <code>@attached(body)</code> macros for synthesizing and augmenting function implementations, expression macros as default arguments, and more.</p>

<p>You can find a complete list of language proposals that were accepted through the <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution">Swift Evolution</a> process and implemented in Swift 6 on the <a href="https://www.swift.org/swift-evolution/#?version=6.0">Swift Evolution dashboard</a>.</p>





<p>Swift 6 provides a new debugging macro to easily customize how an object is displayed in LLDB when using the <code>p</code> command, and in the variables view in Xcode and VSCode, by using a formatting scheme that does not run arbitrary code.</p>

<p>Types that conform to <code>CustomDebugStringConvertible</code> provide a <code>debugDescription</code> property that returns a string describing the object. In LLDB, the <code>po</code> command calls this computed property on an object. In contrast, the <code>p</code> command uses LLDB’s type summary formatters to directly format the object using its stored property values.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/debugdescription()"><code>@DebugDescription</code></a> is a new macro in the standard library which lets you specify LLDB type summaries for your own types directly in code. The macro processes the <code>debugDescription</code> property, translating simple string interpolations involving stored properties into LLDB type summaries. This allows LLDB to use your custom formatting even when using <code>p</code>, and also in Xcode or VSCode’s variable display windows. The macro can use an existing conformance to <code>CustomDebugStringConvertible</code>, or you can provide a separate string interpolation only for use in LLDB’s <code>p</code> command. Providing a separate LLDB description string is useful if your <code>CustomDebugStringConvertible</code> implementation doesn’t meet the requirements of the <code>@DebugDescription</code> macro, or if you’re familiar with the <a href="https://lldb.llvm.org/use/variable.html#summary-strings">LLDB Summary String syntax</a> and you want to use it directly.</p>

<p>For example, the following code customizes how <code>po</code> in LLDB displays the <code>Organization</code> type with a conformance to <code>CustomDebugStringConvertible</code>, and the <code>@DebugDescription</code> macro exposes this custom formatting to the <code>p</code> command and the variables view:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@DebugDescription</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Organization</span><span>:</span> <span>CustomDebugStringConvertible</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>manager</span><span>:</span> <span>Person</span>
  <span>// ... and more</span>

  <span>var</span> <span>debugDescription</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"#</span><span>\(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>\(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span><span> [</span><span>\(</span><span>manager</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>)</span><span>]"</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code>(lldb) p myOrg
(Organization) myOrg = "`#100 Worldwide Travel [Jonathan Swift]`" 
</code></pre></div>



<p>Swift 6 dramatically improves startup performance in the debugger when you use explicit module builds. When debugging locally-built code, LLDB can now import explicitly-built Swift and Clang modules directly from the project build artifacts. This avoids the need to recompile implicit Clang module dependencies from source, which can take a long time, and it’s very sensitive to issues with header search paths. If the first <code>p</code> or <code>po</code> command in LLDB takes a long time due to Clang module compilation, or if your debugging is frequently blocked by Clang header import problems, consider adopting explicit modules in your project!</p>





<p>Swift 6 unifies the implementation of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/">Foundation</a> across all platforms. The modern, portable Swift implementation provides consistency across platforms, it’s more robust, and it’s open source. macOS and iOS started using the Swift implementation of Foundation alongside Swift 5.9, and Swift 6 brings these improvements to Linux and Windows.</p>

<p>Core types like <code>JSONDecoder</code>, <code>URL</code>, <code>Calendar</code>, <code>FileManager</code>, <code>ProcessInfo</code>, and more have been completely reimplemented in Swift. These types share their implementation with macOS 15 and iOS 18, providing a new level of cross-platform consistency, reliability, and performance. Recently released APIs like <code>FormatStyle</code>, <code>ParseStrategy</code>, <code>Predicate</code>, and <code>JSON5</code>, from past macOS and iOS releases are now available on all Swift platforms. New Foundation APIs like <code>Expression</code>, calendar enumeration improvements, calendar recurrence rules, format style enhancements, and more are available simultaneously on macOS, iOS, Linux, and Windows - and they were built with community involvement.</p>

<p>If your Linux or Windows app imports the <code>Foundation</code> library from the Swift toolchain today, you get all of these improvements for free. And if your app is particularly sensitive to binary size, you can now import the <code>FoundationEssentials</code> library, which provides a more targeted subset of Foundation’s features that omits internationalization and localization data.</p>



<p>Swift 6 introduces Swift Testing, a new testing library designed from the ground up for Swift. It includes expressive APIs that make it easy to write and organize tests. It provides detailed output when a test fails using macros like <code>#expect</code>. And it scales to large codebases with features like parameterization to easily repeat a test with different arguments.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@Test</span><span>(</span><span>"Continents mentioned in videos"</span><span>,</span> <span>arguments</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>"A Beach"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"By the Lake"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"Camping in the Woods"</span>
<span>])</span>
<span>func</span> <span>mentionedContinents</span><span>(</span><span>videoName</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>async</span> <span>throws</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>videoLibrary</span> <span>=</span> <span>try</span> <span>await</span> <span>VideoLibrary</span><span>()</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>video</span> <span>=</span> <span>try</span> <span>#require</span><span>(</span><span>await</span> <span>videoLibrary</span><span>.</span><span>video</span><span>(</span><span>named</span><span>:</span> <span>videoName</span><span>))</span>
  <span>#expect(video.mentionedContinents.count &lt;= 3)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Swift Testing takes full advantage of macros. Its <code>@Test</code> and <code>@Suite</code> attached macros declare test functions and suite types respectively, and they accept arguments (known as traits) to customize various behaviors. The <code>#expect</code> and <code>#require</code> expression macros validate expected behaviors, and capture rich representation of expressions and their sub-values to produce detailed failure messages.</p>

<p>Since Swift Testing is included directly in Swift 6 toolchains, you can <code>import Testing</code> without needing to declare a package dependency. This means your tests do not need to build Swift Testing or its dependencies (including swift-syntax), and its macro implementation comes prebuilt. The package manager in Swift 6 automatically builds and runs Swift Testing tests in addition to XCTests (if present), and shows results from both libraries in log output. Swift Testing supports all platforms that Swift officially supports, including all Apple platforms, Linux, and Windows.</p>

                <p><strong>Leaked internal documents from a Kremlin-controlled propaganda center reveal how a well-coordinated Russian campaign supported far-right parties in the European Parliament elections — and planted disinformation across social media platforms to undermine Ukraine.</strong></p>

		
<p>In a video resembling a movie trailer, the head of Russia’s secret propaganda project, Ilya Gambashidze, removes his sunglasses and sits behind a computer, wearing a camouflage-patterned hoodie with the words “Russian Ideological Troops” spelled out on his sleeve. Text flashes on the screen: “Narrative production, content creation, 300 media outlets, 20 think tanks…” The video, part of a leak from Russia’s IT organization Social Design Agency (SDA), appears to be aimed at partners interested in their information operations services.</p>
<p>“Gambashidze is responsible for numerous projects in various countries,” a source connected to EU intelligence told us. The organization and Gambashidze are already sanctioned both in the EU and the U.S.</p>
<p>Amid the ongoing full-scale war in Ukraine, the Russian presidential administration has emerged as a key client of SDA.<span>&nbsp; </span>Recently, the U.S Department of Justice and FBI revealed that Russian officials, including Sergei Kiriyenko, the Russian presidential administration’s chief of staff and often referred to as Vladimir Putin’s right-hand man, have attended several project meetings with Gambashidze. (We exposed his role in supervising influence operations in our previous <a href="https://vsquare.org/tag/kremlin-leaks/"><span>investigative series, #KremlinLeaks</span></a>). Sofia Zakharova, another staffer in Putin’s administration, is also a frequent participant in these meetings.</p>
<p>“Between April 2022 and April 2023, Gambashidze took notes related to at least 20 Russian Presidential Administration meetings,” the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-09/doppelganger_affidavit_9.4.24.pdf"><span>U.S. affidavit</span></a> claims, citing several documents that are now also available to VSquare.</p>
<p>The leaked documents, comprising thousands of files from SDA servers, were obtained by Delfi Estonia, Süddeutsche Zeitung, NDR and WDR, who shared the data with international partners: De Standaard, NRC, Schemes, Shomrim, DR, Profil, Dossier Center, FRONTSTORY.PL and VSquare. The latest FBI files on Russian influence operations correspond with the data from the leak, and refers to the SDA as “<span>a public relations company, specializing in election campaigns, with deep ties to the Russian government.”</span></p>
<p>The leak reveals how the SDA operates as a center for psychological warfare. Its “army” consists not of soldiers, but of meme creators and internet trolls. According to internal records, the agency employs “ideologists”, eight “commentators,” and a “bot farm operator.”</p>
<p>The scale of disinformation production is astonishing. A leaked report claims that in the first four months of 2024, the SDA’s bot army, dubbed the “Russian Digital Army,” generated 33.9 million comments. They also claim to have produced 39,899 “content units” on social media, including 4,641 videos and 2,516 memes and graphics.</p>
<p>Clear quotas are set. For example, in one project targeting Germany and France, the quotas were as follows: “Cartoons – 60 units. Memes – 180 units. Article comments – 400.”</p>
<p>There are hundreds of examples of memes in the leaked documents, some of which were created by cartoonists employed by the SDA.</p>
<p>In internal discussions, those involved do not shy away from admitting that they are producing fake news and disinformation. Elections in Europe and the U.S. are the primary targets.</p>
<p>“The European Parliament elections are in the summer of 2024. Critical milestones are approaching in 2024, including the Bundestag elections and the U.S. presidential election. The outcome of these campaigns will largely determine the West’s future sanctions policy towards Russia and support for Ukraine,” reads one document outlining the focus of these information operations.</p>
<p>The Russians remain optimistic about shifting Western public opinion on Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Public opinion in the project’s target countries is gradually moving towards reducing or completely stopping support for Ukraine,” a document reads.</p>
<p>The leaked files include detailed reports on the thousands of fake comments made in various countries, along with instructions on how to craft such comments.</p>
<p>“Write a comment from a 38-year-old German woman, who believes Germany is losing its main source of income: industry and a strong economy – we must stop wasting money on Ukraine and return to cheap Russian energy!.” one document offered as instruction.</p>
<p>Similar instructions were written for “commenters” aiming at a U.S audience: “Write a 400-character comment from a 38-year-old American woman, who believes military aid to Ukraine and Israel should be cut. Zelensky is wasting taxpayers’ money!”</p>
<p>A similar narrative was crafted to target Poland’s online space: “Write a 400-character comment from a 38-year-old Polish woman, who believes the government is to blame for the country’s rise in food prices. Poland is flirting with Ukraine, it has allowed a million Ukrainian migrants to settle in Poland taking jobs and receiving benefits, it can’t even solve the Ukrainian grain issue to protect its farmers! As a result, ordinary citizens who love this country and pay taxes suffer. This is not good for anything!”</p>
<p>The “Ukrainian grain issue” mentioned in the comment was heavily <a href="https://dfrlab.org/2024/06/03/tailored-russian-disinformation-targets-polish-farmer-protests/"><span>amplified by the Russian</span></a> propaganda machine before the EU elections, presumably to sow division between Poland and Ukraine and undermine solidarity with Ukraine.</p>
<h2><b>Undermining the European Parliament</b></h2>
<p>One goal of Russia’s influence operations, according to the leaked records, is to bolster far-right parties in Western Europe, in the hope that these parties will oppose aid to Ukraine and sanctions on Russia.</p>
<p>According to the documents, Russian operatives thought that the far-right Identity and Democracy (ID) parliamentary group’s success in the European Parliament would benefit Russia. (ID was dissolved after the European elections.)</p>
<p>“Proposal: conduct a comprehensive counter-campaign against liberal globalists, their platform and prominent representatives before the elections to the EP in the countries with the largest representation in this electoral body – Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Poland,” states a project document preparing for elections. It also notes that over half of European Parliament seats belong to these countries, making them key targets.</p>
<p>The document outlines four key narratives to promote. For example: “Liberals and globalists spread fear and want us to panic. We must fear war, climate disasters, viruses, a Russian attack. Through fear, they seek our submission. Additionally, they aim to exploit contradictions around family values, LGBT rights, and the economic uncertainty caused by the war in energy and agriculture.”</p>
<p>The toolkit to achieve these goals includes: [working] in comment sections; memes, videos, cartoons; threads on social media; fakes, street art.</p>
<p>Several documents confirm that the SDA was particularly active in Germany, supporting the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.</p>
<p>“Our opinion leader became the deputy leader of the AfD faction!” reads one Russian meeting memo, though it doesn’t specify who is being referenced.</p>
<p>The Russians also note that AfD’s 2024 election program can be seen as a key Russian strategic narrative: “It is worth noting that AfD’s program for the 2024 elections states that the cause of the Ukraine conflict is ‘the dominance of non-European powers.’ These powers are blamed for ‘dragging European countries into conflict,’” describes a project document.</p>
<p>Another document reveals that the project’s success is gauged by the popularity of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. According to a document listing “key performance indicators,” the project could be considered a success if the AfD were to poll at 20 percent. Other public polls are also used to measure successes in target countries. “Growth of the number of Germans unwilling to sacrifice their well-being for the sake of victory – 55 percent,” says one document.</p>
<p>Talking points are proposed to achieve those aims. For example: “The U.S is waging an economic and hybrid war against Russia at the expense of Germany. Anti-Russian decisions by NATO and the EU harm Germans first and foremost.”</p>
<p><span>Metrics for success are similar in France: T</span>he National Rally (previously known as National Front) should be polling at 20 percent and “the number of French people who do not want to sacrifice their well-being for the sake of victory over Russia/for the sake of Ukraine should exceed 44 percent.”</p>
<p>After the European elections, the SDA <span>evaluated</span> its success. In this post-election analysis, it took notice of the increase in right-wing representatives in the European Parliament.</p>
<p>“Thus, we can state a serious success of the campaign in social networks,” they concluded.</p>
<p>However, the same document warns that the success of the far-right in the European Parliament does not necessarily translate into success for Russia. As a cautionary example, it cites Giorgia Meloni’s “hawkish” stance (she has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine)<span> and notes that Marine Le Pen’s support is also not without complications as Le Pen publicly applauded Zelensky during his visit to Paris, which did not go unnoticed by the Russians.</span></p>
<p>“Overall, though, the general success of the far-right in the European Parliament elections is perceived globally as a success for Russian foreign policy and, moreover, for Russian propaganda,” the document states.</p>
<h2><b>Planting fakes for useful idiots</b></h2>
<p>The SDA isn’t only generating comments for non-existent 38-year-old women in Germany and America. Its employees also fabricate Ukrainian documents and official quotes to be disseminated through the media. For instance, SDA created forged documents and quotes related to the crash of an Il-76 plane in Belgorod in January 2024. Russian propaganda claimed at the time that this plane was carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war and blamed Ukraine for shooting it down. These “fakes,” as the SDA itself calls them, were created to persuade the public that Ukraine was hiding that fact. A document titled “Register of Fakes and Doppelgangers” details 73 instances where the SDA created disinformation for distribution.</p>
<p>“Our new team fabricated a story about child abductions. The Americans seriously published it. That’s a success!” boasted Sofia Zakharova, who is associated with the Russian presidential administration. This comes from an SDA meeting protocol from September 2023.</p>
<p>A few weeks before this meeting, information began circulating on Telegram channels about Ukrainian children whose organs were being sold on the dark web. Some of the reports weaving their way through social media blamed the “Kiev regime” orchestrating child evacuations. This claim was meant to mirror the allegations made by the International Criminal Court against Russian President Vladimir Putin and the head of the Russian child deportation program in Ukraine, <a href="https://vsquare.org/kremlin-leaks-putin-elections-russia-propaganda-ukraine/"><span>Maria Lvova-Belova</span></a>.</p>
<p>Soon, this disinformation narrative was even spread by some U.S. politicians, such as Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a congresswoman from the state of Georgia.</p>
<p>The SDA team also highlights Greene in a U.S.-focused document, explaining how their information operations are picked up by influential figures in the U.S. The document includes a link to an article from Breitbart, a far-right U.S. news outlet, in which Greene indicates that weapons supplied by the United States to Ukraine have reached Hamas.</p>
<p>The same document indicates that reducing U.S. support for Ukraine can be achieved by contrasting it with the American economic situation.</p>
<p>“The question ‘where is our money going?’ should be the most frequent in the comments section,” the document says.</p>
<h2><b>“The Other Ukraine”</b></h2>
<p>One notable project has a code-name “The Other Ukraine” and is aimed at Ukrainians in the Western Europe, Russia and Ukraine itself.</p>
<p>“Another Ukraine” has been associated with exiled Ukrainian oligarch and close friend of Putin, Viktor Medvedchuk, in media reports before. Leaked documentation now suggests that the project is aided and orchestrated also by SDA.</p>
<p>Medvedchuk’s association can also be seen in the documents, according to which the project aims to “position Viktor Medvedchuk as a consistent fighter for a peaceful future for Ukraine.”</p>
<p>“There is an alternative to war. Medvedchuk talks about peaceful dialogue as an alternative to a possible nuclear war,” the document says.</p>
<p>The project proposes to use Ukrainian language for propaganda purposes.</p>
<p>“A full-fledged information agency aimed at Ukrainians and operating within the framework of the ideology of the ‘Other Ukraine’ must appear in the information space,” a project document indicates. “This source should ensure the loyalty of the ‘new Russian Ukrainians’ to the President of Russia and active support for his policies.”</p>
<p>A comprehensive table with a detailed media plan follows: it says what<span>&nbsp; </span>texts, videos, infographics and photos should be produced and released and how often. For example, the instructions call for “comments in support and defense of and the quota is set to 300 comments per day.</p>
<p><span>According to Ukrainian prosecutors, as well as European security agencies, Medvedchuk is also associated with the <a href="https://vsquare.org/eu-parliament-russia-interference-investigative-journalism-pellegrini/"><span>Voice Of Europe scandal</span></a></span>: MEPs were paid to disseminate Russian propaganda; several participated in activities organized by pro-Russian media outlet Voice of Europe, which was used to funnel the money. <span>After the network’s associates in the Czech Republic and Poland (where authorities seized €48,500 and $36,000) were arrested, the outlet and connected businessmen were sanctioned by the EU.</span> Later, Belgian police raided the EU Parliament office and private home of an assistant to an MEP who worked for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and received Russian money <span>through</span> the Voice of Europe network.</p>
<p>An EU intelligence source claims both projects were actually prepared in the Kremlin.</p>
<p>“The Other Ukraine and Voice of Europe were developed in early 2023, in Russia’s Presidential Administration, in the office of Sergey Kiriyenko,” the source says.</p>
<h2><b>Info ops center in Kaliningrad</b></h2>
<p>In a document titled “Information operations project office Baltics,” the SDA considers the creation of a center in Kaliningrad, which would focus on the Baltic states, Poland and Germany.</p>
<p>“Thanks to its geographical location and historical cultural ties with Europe, Kaliningrad Oblast is the most convenient springboard for organizing and conducting information operations in EU countries,” the document states.</p>
<p>The project names the following objectives: spreading Russian narratives; influencing political and economic decisions; influencing electoral processes; forming groups and networks of supporters; promoting the interests of Russian business; and creating a system for the promotion of the Russian agenda in the media and social networks.</p>
<p><span>The documents outline the new institution’s structure, including units such as an</span> analytical monitoring center and content center; IT and IS division; legal expertise center; and translation bureau.</p>
<p>Several documents mention Poland, one of the main targets for the SDA’s manipulative efforts. Among them is a note on the likely results of the MEP elections. The memo proposes a “counter-campaign” against the “liberal globalists.”</p>
<p>The SDA also monitors the Polish media space and searches for divisive statements. One such report quotes Krzysztof Bosak, deputy speaker of the Sejm and leader of the far-right Confederation, whose statements on Israel triggered a public clash with theIsraeli ambassador to Poland.</p>
<h2><b>Rest of the world in sight</b></h2>
<p>The examples above are still only a fraction of the SDA’s operations. There are numerous campaigns with different aims in different countries. The DOJ affidavit mentions four different projects aimed at the U.S alone.</p>
<p>A campaign separate from “The Other Ukraine” suggests dividing Ukraine into 20 regions and preparing information operations for each region. “50,000 comments in 20 regions of Ukraine per month,” the document says.</p>
<p>Israel is another target.</p>
<p>“Currently, the situation in the State of Israel seems very favorable for starting a serious project to influence public opinion. The goal of such influence should be to tear Israel out of the general Western anti-Russian agenda,” a project document titled “Normal Israel” says. Again, quotas for comments, texts and memes are provided.</p>
<p>“SDA records also revealed its planning of campaigns targeting foreign countries, including Mexico and Israel, with the intent that those efforts would influence associated ethnic or religious groups residing in the United States,” the DOJ affidavit says.</p>
<p>Separate objectives are set for Eastern Europe and Central Asia.</p>
<p>The need to “neutralize external pressure on the political leadership of these countries by mobilizing the public to support initiatives that run counter to the interests of the United States and its allies” is mentioned in a document in regard to Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. “Such mobilization must be carried out through information impact on national audiences,” the document reads.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/17/amazon-andy-jassy-rto-mandate-employees-angry/">https://fortune.com/2024/09/17/amazon-andy-jassy-rto-mandate-employees-angry/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41570981">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/">Amazon</a> employees are slamming the company’s return-to-office policy and plotting their exit less than 24 hours after CEO Andy Jassy announced that they must return to the office five days a week from January.</p><div>



<p>While some Amazon workers are ripping into the company’s toughened RTO policy on social media, others are even blasting their employer in the company’s internal Slack channel.</p>



<p>“Please do note that this is (in a lot of cases) significantly more strict and out of its mind than many teams operated under pre-COVID,” one staffer wrote on Slack, according to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-workers-blast-strict-rto-mandate-five-days-week-2024-9" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-workers-blast-strict-rto-mandate-five-days-week-2024-9" rel="noopener"><em>Business Insider.</em></a></p>



<p>“This is not ‘going back’ to how it was before. It’s just going backwards.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another employee suggested they’d rather be put on the company’s aggressive <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/03/20/amazon-layoffs-performance-review-tech-human-resources-andy-jassy/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/03/20/amazon-layoffs-performance-review-tech-human-resources-andy-jassy/">performance improvement plan</a> than comply with the mandate: “Can I negotiate my manager to PIP me… Take my money and leave?”</p>



<p>Employees aren’t just talking about quitting, a small few have already changed their status on <a href="https://fortune.com/company/linkedin/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/linkedin/">LinkedIn</a> to #opentowork as they openly search for more flexible jobs.</p>



<p>“Amazon has announced 5 day RTO, which is unfortunate because I’m interested in working for a living, not live-action role playing and virtue signaling,” an Amazon Web Services engineer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7241512219354480640/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7241512219354480640/" rel="noopener">posted</a> on the networking platform.</p>



<p>“If you have remote opportunities available, please message me. Nothing is off the table. I’d rather go back to school than work in an office again.”</p>



<p>A <span>commentator on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1fiaso5/amazon_tells_employees_to_return_to_office_five/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1fiaso5/amazon_tells_employees_to_return_to_office_five/" rel="noopener">Reddit</a>&nbsp;who claims to have worked at Amazon for three years sai</span>d that they’re mentally checking out of their current role while they hunt for another.</p>



<p>“Probably going to soft quit and get a new job. F—k Jassy,” the user wrote, describing the measure as a “swift kick to the nuts.”</p>







<p>Amazon veteran, Jassy—who took the helm after Jeff Bezos <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/03/jeff-bezos-moving-from-seattle-washington-to-miami-florida-amazon-blue-origin/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/11/03/jeff-bezos-moving-from-seattle-washington-to-miami-florida-amazon-blue-origin/">stepped down</a> in 2021—issued a <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/ceo-andy-jassy-latest-update-on-amazon-return-to-office-manager-team-ratio" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/ceo-andy-jassy-latest-update-on-amazon-return-to-office-manager-team-ratio" rel="noopener">memo</a> to all staffers yesterday that said they will be required to work in the office “the way we were before the onset of COVID.”</p>



<p>“Before the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week, and that will also be true moving forward—our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances,” Jassy, who started working at the $1.94 trillion tech giant in 1997, wrote.</p>



<p>Of course, many people moved to the suburbs and made childcare arrangements according to the company’s current 3 day in-office policy—or as Jassy puts it “set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments.”</p>



<p>That’s why the 56-year-old said that the new stricter enforcement will not kick in until the new year to “help ensure a smooth transition.”</p>



<p>The CEO added that moving forward remote working will be reserved for emergency scenarios like “if you or your child” is sick.</p>



<h2>‘What better way to cut jobs’</h2>



<p>Jassy positioned the changes at Amazon—which also include a flattened hierarchy and no more hot desking—as a better way to work.</p>



<p>“We’ve observed that it’s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another,” Jassy insisted.</p>



<p>However, some disgruntled proffesionals have suggested that the new policy is designed to reduce its current 1.5 million-plus headcount.</p>



<p>“This is a layoff in disguise,” one user complained on Reddit. “Return to the office or you’re fired and we don’t have to pay any severance or unemployment.”</p>



<p>“What better way to cut jobs than to force everyone back into the office and watch people quit in droves,” another wrote.</p>



<p>Amazon didn’t respond to <em>Fortune’s</em> request for comment, including whether the policy is a thinly veiled headcount reduction.</p>



<p>However, the company has previously used its in-office mandate to cut out defiant workers.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Amazon managers were given the green light to <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/20/amazon-return-to-office-mandate-manager-guidelines/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/10/20/amazon-return-to-office-mandate-manager-guidelines/">fire employees</a> who fail to show face three days a week in the office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile the company’s “return-to-hub” mandate in July forced remote workers to pick working (and in some cases <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/22/amazon-employees-are-quitting-after-they-were-told-to-relocate-states.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/22/amazon-employees-are-quitting-after-they-were-told-to-relocate-states.html" rel="noopener">relocating</a>) to the closest office to them—or resign.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article> <p>Developers tend to treat tracing as deep magic, and OpenTelemetry is no exception. OpenTelemetry may be even
<em>more</em> mysterious given how many concepts your are exposed to even with
<a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/9c30124e764e08bd6ccf8dbfbe426a8531c20352/examples/basic-tracer-node/index.js">beginning examples</a>.
<a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label"><code>[1]</code></a></p>
<p>It also doesn’t help that as part of building a mature, battle-tested tracing library, the code itself tends to become
more and more cryptic over time, contorting itself to avoid edge-cases, work across many environments, and optimize
code paths to avoid impacting performance of its host applications. <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js-contrib/blob/12adb4354f09ade438cd96340bdfd1f715b5fed3/plugins/node/opentelemetry-instrumentation-express/src/instrumentation.ts#L153-L327">Auto-instrumentation is particularly prone to
inscrutibility</a> as it seeks to auto-magically wrap code that may never have been intended to be wrapped or extended.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder then that most developers approach tracing libraries as unknownable black boxes. We add them to our
applications, cross our fingers, and hope they give us useful information when the pager goes off at 2am.</p>
<p>They are likely a lot simpler than you expect! Once you peel back the layers, I find a useful mental model of tracing
looks like “fancy logging” combined with “context propagation” a.k.a “passing some IDs around”.</p>
<h3 id="logs">Logs</h3>
<p>Developers tend to be very comfortable with logs. We start off with “Hello world!”, and they stay with us forever after.
We reach for them to add <code>console.log("potato")</code> to see if our code is even being run (even though the debugger is
like <em>right there</em>).</p>
<p>Logs are useful! Though hopefully someone comes along and convinces you that your logs should always be structured as sets of key / value pairs.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>If you make one New Year’s resolution related to modernizing your infrastructure and preparing for the brave new world of distributed systems, I suggest this:</p><p>Structure your logs.</p><p>You won’t be sorry. You will eventually be so, so glad you did.</p><p>Just do it.</p></div>— Charity Majors (@mipsytipsy) <a href="https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/951272678345687040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2018</a></blockquote> 
<p>It’s nice to have some consistency in your logs: make sure each one has a consistently-formatted timestamp or includes a field like
“name” so you can easily find them when searching. You probably have found yourself writing a helper function like this in your projects:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"user-authenticated"</span><span>, { userId, remaingingRateLimit });</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// ...</span></span>

<span><span>  console.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span></span>

<span><span>      name,</span></span>
<span><span>      timestamp: </span><span>new</span><span> Date</span><span>().</span><span>getTime</span><span>(),</span></span>
<span><span>      ...</span><span>attributes,</span></span>
<span><span>    })</span></span>
<span><span>  );</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="js"><code><span><span>{ </span><span>"timestamp"</span><span>: </span><span>1725845013447</span><span>, </span><span>"name"</span><span>: </span><span>"user-authenticated"</span><span>, </span><span>"userId"</span><span>: </span><span>"1234"</span><span>, </span><span>"remaingingRateLimit"</span><span>: </span><span>100</span><span> }</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>You might also have written something to help track how long some sub-task takes:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>logTiming</span><span>(</span><span>"query-user-info"</span><span>, () </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  db.</span><span>fetchUserInfo</span><span>();</span></span>
<span><span>});</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// ....</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> logTiming</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>, </span><span>attributes</span><span> =</span><span> {}, </span><span>lambda</span><span>) {</span></span>

<span></span>
<span><span>  // run some subtask</span></span>

<span></span></code></pre>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="js"><code><span><span>{ </span><span>"timestamp"</span><span>: </span><span>1725845013447</span><span>, </span><span>"name"</span><span>: </span><span>"query-user-info"</span><span>, </span><span>"durationMs"</span><span>: </span><span>12</span><span> }</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>If so, congrats! You’re halfway to re-inventing trace spans.</p>
<h2 id="spans-are-fancy-log-lines">Spans are ✨fancy✨ log lines</h2>
<p>A trace is built-up of spans. The example below shows a single trace with 4 different spans:</p>
<p><img src="https://jeremymorrell.dev/_astro/trace-example.CjGDJS25_1rbk53.webp" alt="A Honeycomb screenshot of a trace waterfall" width="1930" height="318" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>You can think of a span as a collection of key / value pairs, much like a log line, with a few required fields.
Spans must have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a name</li>
<li>a timestamp</li>
<li>a duration</li>
<li>a set of IDs: trace ID, span ID, and a parent span ID. More about these later</li>
</ul>
<p>All other fields can be added as additional keys and values in an <code>attributes</code> map.</p>
<p>In code this might look something like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>let</span><span> span </span><span>=</span><span> new</span><span> Span</span><span>(</span><span>"api-req"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>let</span><span> resp </span><span>=</span><span> await</span><span> api</span><span>(</span><span>"get-user-limits"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>span.</span><span>setAttributes</span><span>({ responseCode: resp.code });</span></span>
<span><span>span.</span><span>End</span><span>();</span></span>
<span><span>console.</span><span>log</span><span>(span);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// ...</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>class</span><span> Span</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  constructor</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>, </span><span>context</span><span> =</span><span> {}, </span><span>attributes</span><span> =</span><span> new</span><span> Map</span><span>()) {</span></span>

<p>Tracing execution like this can get you surprisingly far! But we can do better.</p>
<p>Trace spans have 3 different IDs that make up the Trace Context. The first two are really simple:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Span ID</strong>: a random ID for each span</li>
<li><strong>Trace ID</strong>: a random ID that multiple spans can share</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one is a little more complicated:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parent Span ID</strong>: the Span ID that was the active span when this span was created</li>
</ul>
<p>The Parent Span ID is what allows a system to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">DAG</a>
out of each trace once it has received each individual span. When rendered as a tree this results in
the waterfall view we all know and love, but it’s important to remember that this is only one possible
visualization of the data.</p>
<p><img src="https://jeremymorrell.dev/_astro/trace-example.CjGDJS25_1rbk53.webp" alt="A Honeycomb screenshot of a trace waterfall" width="1930" height="318" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="existing-in-the-context">Existing in the context</h2>
<p>Our context only really needs two values: the trace id, and the id of the current span. When
we create a new span, we can inherit the <code>spanID</code> if one exists, generate a new <code>spanID</code>,
and set the new context.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="js"><code><span><span>let</span><span> context </span><span>=</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  traceID: </span><span>"cfd3fd1ad40f008fea72e06901ff722b"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  spanID: </span><span>"6b65f0c5db08556d"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>};</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>We need some way of passing this context around our application. We could do this manually:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="js"><code><span><span>let</span><span> { span, newContext } </span><span>=</span><span> new</span><span> Span</span><span>(</span><span>"api-req"</span><span>, oldContext);</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>Indeed, this is <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/blob/b37e8a9860f03b78baf2c3ca0edcbc6c7f8fd969/example/namedtracer/main.go#L65">how it is done in the official Go SDK</a> however in most languages
this is done implicitly and handled automatically by the library. In Ruby or Python you can use a thread
local variable, but in Node you would use <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html#class-asynclocalstorage">AsyncLocalStorage</a>.</p>
<p>At this point it helps to wrap our span creation in a helper function:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="js"><code><span><span>import</span><span> { AsyncLocalStorage } </span><span>from</span><span> "node:async_hooks"</span><span>;</span></span>

<p>Our tracing library is perfectly usable even at <a href="https://github.com/jmorrell/minimal-nodejs-otel-tracer/blob/5ff45161aa2d6c0c6d0a41139803d54a2f88829d/simple_tracer.js">under 60 LoC</a>
but it has 2 big drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have to manually add it everywhere</li>
<li>It also is restricted to a single system. We do not have a mechanism for passing the trace
context between any two systems in our larger service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s fix that!</p>
<h2 id="going-distributed">Going distributed</h2>
<p>Distributed tracing sounds scary and intimidating, but it generally means that tracing
context can be passed around between systems so that you can track what operation kicked off
what other operation, and that all of this data gets reported to the same place at the end.</p>
<p>Whenever we make an HTTP call to another system, we need to pass along the Trace ID and the
Current Span ID. We could add these two fields to all of our HTTP payloads manually but
there’s a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/">W3C standard</a> for how to encode this into
an HTTP header so that it gets sent as metadata for every request. The <code>traceparent</code> header
looks like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="log"><code><span><span>00-0af7651916cd43dd8448eb211c80319c-b7ad6b7169203331-01</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>There is a full specification to digest and implement here, but for our purposes today we can ignore
most of this and think of it as conforming to this format:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="log"><code><span><span>00</span><span>-{ Trace ID}-{ Parent Span ID }-</span><span>01</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>which allows us to parse and serialize our trace context with some simple functions:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="js"><code><span><span>let</span><span> getTraceParent</span><span> =</span><span> (</span><span>ctx</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> `00-${</span><span>ctx</span><span>.</span><span>traceID</span><span>}-${</span><span>ctx</span><span>.</span><span>spanID</span><span>}-01`</span><span>;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>let</span><span> parseTraceParent</span><span> =</span><span> (</span><span>header</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> ({</span></span>
<span><span>  traceID: header.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>"-"</span><span>)[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span></span>
<span><span>  spanID: header.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>"-"</span><span>)[</span><span>2</span><span>],</span></span>
<span><span>});</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>We need to be sure to add it to our outgoing requests, and parse it on any incoming requests.
Instrumentation helps with that.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-stuff-in-other-stuff">Wrap stuff in other stuff</h2>
<p><em>Instrumentation</em> is a fancy term for “wrap some other code in our code so we can track stuff”. Real
tracing libraries sometimes go to extreme lengths to make wrapping built-in or popular libraries
happen behind the scenes when you configure the library. We’re not going to be doing that.</p>
<p>Instead we’ll provide some <a href="https://hono.dev/docs/guides/middleware">middleware</a> for the

it emits data in the <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/">OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)</a>.
Every OpenTelemetry SDK in every language emits OTLP. The <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector">OpenTelemetry
Collector</a> is a collection of
tools for receiving OTLP, transforming OTLP, translating other formats to OTLP.
You could say OTLP is kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>OTLP has <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/6f589125b0b7d708c9b0f32916378182ac1e123d/opentelemetry/proto/trace/v1/trace.proto#L86">its own protobuf specification</a>
so you can efficiently compress telemetry data into a binary message that will be the same
across any platform, OS, or CPU architecture. We could generate a JavaScript module to
parse and emit these protobuf messages from the <code>.proto</code> files, but that sounds like
too much work.</p>
<p>Protobuf also defines a <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/#json-protobuf-encoding">JSON mapping</a> as part
of the spec, and the specification repo has <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/6f589125b0b7d708c9b0f32916378182ac1e123d/examples/trace.json">a handy example for us to start from</a>, so let’s keep it simple instead.</p>
<p>Generating this payload is a bit more complicated than Honeycomb’s old events format. There are some
new terms like “resource” and “scope”, and we have to massage the attributes a bit. However if you
squint, you can see that it’s all the same data. <a href="https://github.com/jmorrell/minimal-nodejs-otel-tracer/blob/5ff45161aa2d6c0c6d0a41139803d54a2f88829d/tracer.js#L107-L179">Full version here</a></p>

<h2 id="thats-it">That’s it!?</h2>
<p>That’s it! In <a href="https://github.com/jmorrell/minimal-nodejs-otel-tracer/blob/ad35d40e3255715b7fb69bcd367f66f1e5cd2a57/tracer.js">181 lines of code</a> we’ve implemented tracing, trace context propagation, instrumentation, and exported it in a standard format that any vendor or tool should be able
to accept. Thanks to the magic of 🌈standards🌈.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-you-know-legal">Is this… you know… legal?</h2>
<p>If you were paying attention, there are a lot of <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/">OpenTelemetry specifications</a> around
how an OpenTelemetry SDK should be structured and behave. Our little library doesn’t do almost any of that. This is just for
learning but one could imagine a simplified non-compliant SDK such as <a href="https://github.com/evanderkoogh/otel-cf-workers">this one for Cloudflare
Workers</a>. It emits OTLP but doesn’t conform to all of the SDK specifications.
How should we think about this?</p>
<p>At the <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-telemetry-community-day/">OTel Community Day</a> last June, OpenTelemetry cofounder
<a href="https://twitter.com/tedsuo">Ted Young</a> was asked a similar question. I wrote down his answer as best as I could. Lightly paraphrased:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don’t care about the spec. We care about that the black box participates in tracing and emits OTLP and semantic conventions. The true spec is the data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I take that to mean, while official SDKs are expected to follow the spec, it’s reasonable for other implementations
to deviate as long as an outside observer cannot tell the difference from the behavior. Our little library does’t quite
pass due to the shortcuts taken in parsing the <code>traceparent</code> header, but it would not take much more code to fix this.</p>
<p>If OpenTelemetry continues to be successful I expect OTLP, the ability to emit and receive it, will get built into everything:
your IDE tooling, the platform you deploy on, the framework on which you are building, even hardware. Some day your internet-connected
dryer will almost certainly speak OTLP, if it doesn’t already.</p>
<h2 id="hold-on-why-is-opentelemetry-js-so-much-bigger">Hold on… why is <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js">opentelemetry-js</a> so much bigger?</h2>
<p>If we can build a functional tracer in under 200 lines, why does the official JavaScript SDK have so much more code?</p>
<p>It might help to go over a non-exhaustive list of things the offical SDK handles that our little learning library doesn’t:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buffer and batch outgoing telemetry data in a more efficient format. Don’t send one-span-per-http request in production. Your vendor will want to have words.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-runtimes">Work in both the browser and in Node environments</a></li>
<li>Gracefully handle errors, wrap this library around your core functionality at your own peril</li>
<li>Be incredibly configurable. Need to do something that isn’t bog standard? You can probably make it happen</li>
<li>Automagically wrap common libraries in robust, battle-tested instrumentation</li>
<li>Optimized for performance when used in your code’s tight loops</li>
<li>Conform to <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/semantic-conventions/">semantic conventions</a></li>
<li>Support two whole other types of telemetry: metrics and logging</li>
</ul>
<p>And more! I hope this post has given you a better mental model for the work happening under all of the production hardening and
extensibility that tends to build up on these libraries when they have to be used in the real world. A library that can reliably
work across most places we deploy JavaScript and meet a very broad range of user needs is highly non-trivial.</p>
<p>But tracing? We know that’s just ✨fancy logging✨ right?</p>

                            <em>WonderWorld</em> allows real-time rendering and fast scene generation. 
                            This allows a user to navigate existing contents, and specify <em>where</em> and <em>what</em> to generate.
                            Here are examples where a user specifies scene contents (via text) and locations (via camera movement).

                        <em>WonderWorld</em> takes a single image as input and generates connected diverse 3D scenes to form a virtual world. 
                        Users can specify new scene contents and styles via text, and specify where to generate new scenes via camera movement
                        as our system allows real-time rendering.
                        Our system generates a single 3D scene in less than 10 seconds thank to our Fast LAyered Gaussian Surfels (FLAGS) representation
                        that has two key designs:
                        Firstly, our layered design requires only a single image to generate a scene, whereas existing scene generation methods require progressively 
                        generating multiple views.
                        Secondly, our surfel design enables a geometry-based initialization, so that optimization is conceptually a "fine-tuning" 
                        that is must faster than other representations (e.g., NeRF and Gaussian Splatting) that need to optimize geometry from scratch.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        We present WonderWorld, a novel framework for <em>interactive</em> 3D scene generation that 
                        enables users to interactively specify scene contents and layout and see the created scenes in low latency.
                        The major challenge lies in achieving fast generation of 3D scenes.
                        Existing scene generation approaches fall short of speed as they often require 
                        (1) progressively generating many views and depth maps, and (2) time-consuming optimization of the scene representations. 
                        We introduce the Fast LAyered Gaussian Surfels (FLAGS) as our scene representation and an algorithm 
                        to generate it from a single view. Our approach does not need multiple views, 
                        and it leverages a geometry-based initialization that significantly reduces optimization time. 
                        Another challenge is generating coherent geometry that allows all scenes to be connected. 
                        We introduce the guided depth diffusion that allows partial conditioning of depth estimation.
                        WonderWorld generates connected and diverse 3D scenes in less than 10 seconds on a single A6000 GPU, 
                        enabling real-time user interaction and exploration.
                        We demonstrate the potential of WonderWorld for user-driven content creation and exploration in virtual environments.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ph3at.github.io/posts/Windows-Input/">https://ph3at.github.io/posts/Windows-Input/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41568418">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p>When you are developing a game for PC – or porting one – then you will have to deal with user input, generally from three distinct categories of sources: <strong>mouse</strong>, <strong>keyboard</strong>, and <strong>gamepads</strong>.</p><p>At first, it could reasonably be assumed that mouse and keyboard should be the simplest parts of this to deal with, but in reality, they are not – at least if we are talking about Windows. In fact, <strong><em>several extremely popular AAA games ship with severe mouse input issues when specific high-end mice are used</em></strong>, and some popular engines have issues that are still extant.</p><p>In this article we’ll explore a few reasons why that is the case, and end up with a solution that works but is still unsatisfactory. I assume that there is a whole other level of complexity involved in properly dealing with accessories like steering wheels, flight sticks, and so on in simulators, but so far I never had the pleasure of working on a game that required this, and this article will not cover those types of input devices.</p><blockquote><p>If you are already an expert on game input on Windows, please skip directly to <a href="#our-current-solution">our current solution</a> and tell us how to do it better, because I hope fervently that it’s not the best!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>While the vast majority of this article is about mouse input, we also recently discovered something really interesting about xinput performance that we will share <a href="#a-note-on-xinput">towards the end of the article</a>.</p></blockquote><h2 id="background--raw-input">Background – Raw Input</h2><p>In Windows, there are many ways to receive input from the user. The most traditional one is to receive Windows messages, which are sent to your application’s message queue. This is how you receive keyboard and mouse input in a typical Windows application. However, this method has a few drawbacks when it comes to games.</p><p>The most notable of these drawbacks is that you cannot use the message queue to receive precise and unaltered mouse input, which is particularly important for any game where the mouse is used to control a 3D camera. Traditional input is meant to control a cursor, and the system will apply acceleration and other transformations to the input before it reaches your application, and also won’t give you sub-pixel precision.</p><blockquote><p>If your game only has cursor-based input, e.g. a strategy game or point-and-click adventure, then you can probably get away with ignoring everything mouse-related in this article and just blissfully use standard Windows messages.</p></blockquote><p>The solution to this problem is to use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/using-raw-input">Raw Input API</a>, which allows you to receive input from devices like mice and keyboards in a raw, unaltered form. This is the API that most games use to receive input from the mouse, and the linked article provides a good overview of how to use it, which I will not repeat here.</p><p>So, why the somewhat whiny undertone of this article? Oh, we’re just getting started.</p><p><a href="https://ph3at.github.io/assets/2024-09-16-Windows-Input/razer-viper-8k-hero.jpg"><img data-src="/assets/2024-09-16-Windows-Input/razer-viper-8k-hero.jpg" alt="A Razer Viper mouse with 8k polling rate" width="90%" id="fancyimg" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://ph3at.github.io/assets/2024-09-16-Windows-Input/razer-viper-8k-hero.jpg"></a> <em>A Razer Viper mouse with 8k polling rate – I assume that all of these people stare in bewilderment as to why some of their games drop by 100 FPS when they use it (Image source: Razer)</em></p><h2 id="using-raw-input"><span>Using Raw Input</span><a href="#using-raw-input"><i></i></a></h2><p>If you are familiar with the Raw Input API, or just read the linked documentation, then you might believe that I’m just getting at the importance of using buffered input rather than processing individual events, but really, that wouldn’t be too bad or worth an article. The real problem is that it is not nearly as simple as that – in fact, as far as I can tell, <strong>there is no good general way to do this at all</strong>.</p><p>Let’s step back a bit – for those who have not done this before, there are two ways to receive raw input from a device:</p><ol><li><p>Using <strong>standard reads</strong> from the device, which is the most straightforward way to do it. This basically just involves receiving additional messages of type <code>WM_INPUT</code> in your message queue, which you can then process.</p></li><li><p>Using <strong>buffered reads</strong>, where you access all extant raw input events at once by calling <code>GetRawInputBuffer</code>.</p></li></ol><p>As you might surmise, the latter method is designed to be more performant, as message handling of individual events using the message queue is not particularly efficient.</p><p>Now, actually doing this, and doing it correctly, is not as easy as it should be – or maybe I just missed something. As far as I can tell, to prevent problems related to “losing” messages that occur at specific points in time, while only processing raw input in batched form, you need to do something like the following:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>As shown in the code snippet above, you need to peek all messages except <code>WM_INPUT</code> to ensure that you don’t lose any messages that occur between the times you are processing batched raw input and “normal” messages. This is not made particularly clear in the documentation, and it’s also not made particularly easy by the API, but a few extra lines of code can solve the problem.</p><p>All of this <em>still</em> wouldn’t be a big deal, just the normal amount of scuff you expect when working on an operating system which has a few decades of backwards compatibility to maintain. So, let’s get to the real problem.</p><h2 id="the-real-problem"><span>The Real Problem</span><a href="#the-real-problem"><i></i></a></h2><p>Let’s assume you did all this correctly, and are now receiving raw input from the mouse, in a buffered way, as suggested. You might think that you are done, but you are not. In fact, you are <em>still</em> just getting started.</p><p><a href="https://ph3at.github.io/assets/2024-09-16-Windows-Input/frametime_comparison.png"><img data-src="/assets/2024-09-16-Windows-Input/frametime_comparison.png" alt="Comparison Frametime Chart with and without mouse movement" width="90%" id="fancyimg" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://ph3at.github.io/assets/2024-09-16-Windows-Input/frametime_comparison.png"></a> <em>Comparison between no mouse movement (upper part) and mouse movement (lower part), everything else equal</em></p><p>What you see above is a comparison of the frametime performance chart of a game, in the exact same scene. The only difference is that in the lower part, the mouse is being vigorously shaken about – and not just any mouse, but a high-end one with a polling rate of 8 kHz. As you can see, just moving the mouse around destroys performance, dropping from being consistently pegged at the soft FPS cap (around 360 FPS) to ~133 FPS and becoming completely unstable. <strong><em>Just by vigorous mouse movement.</em></strong></p><p>Now you might think “Aha, he included this to show how important it is to use batched processing!”. Sadly not, what you see above <em>is, in fact, the performance of the game when using batched raw input processing</em>. Let’s talk about why this is the case, and what to do about it.</p><h2 id="the-bane-of-legacy-input"><span>The Bane of Legacy Input</span><a href="#the-bane-of-legacy-input"><i></i></a></h2><p>To make a long story short, the problem is so-called <strong>“legacy input”</strong>. When you initialize raw input for a device using <code>RegisterRawInputDevices</code>, you can specify the <code>RIDEV_NOLEGACY</code> flag. This flag prevents the system from generating “legacy” messages, such as <code>WM_MOUSEMOVE</code>. And there we have our problem: if you don’t specify this flag, then the system will generate both raw input messages and legacy messages, and the latter will still clutter your message queue.</p><p>So once again, why am I whining about this? Just disable legacy input, right? Indeed, that completely solves the performance issue – as long as you do everything else correctly as outlined above of course.</p><p>And then you congratulate yourself on a job well done, and move on to the next task. A few days later after the build is pushed to beta testers, you get a bug report that the game window can no longer be moved around. And then you realize that you just disabled the system’s ability to move the window around, because that is done using legacy input.</p><blockquote><p>Disabling legacy input disables any form of input interaction that you would normally expect to be handled by the system.</p></blockquote><p>So what can we do about this? Here is a short list of things I considered, or even fully implemented, and which either don’t work, can not actually be done, or are just silly in terms of complexity:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Use a separate message-only window and thread for input processing</strong>. This seemed like a good solution, so I went through the trouble of implementing it. It basically involves creating an entirely separate invisible window and registering raw input with it rather than the main window. A bit of a hassle, but it seemed like it would resolve the issue and do it “right”. No luck: the system will still generate high-frequency legacy messages for the main window, even if the raw input device is registered with the other window.</p><blockquote><p>Raw input affects the entire process, even though the API takes a window handle.</p></blockquote></li><li><p><strong>Only disable legacy input in fullscreen modes</strong>. This would at least solve the problem for the vast majority of users, but it’s not possible, as far as I can tell. You seemingly <strong>cannot</strong> switch between legacy and raw input once you’ve enabled it. You might think <code>RIDEV_REMOVE</code> would help, but that completely removes all input that the device generates, including both legacy and raw input.</p><blockquote><p>You can’t switch between legacy and raw input once you’ve enabled it.</p></blockquote></li><li><p><strong>Use a separate process to provide raw input</strong>. This is a bit of a silly idea, but it’s one that I can think of that would actually work. You could create a separate process that provides raw input to the main process, and then use some form of IPC to communicate the input. This would be a massive hassle, and I really don’t want to support something like that, but I’m pretty sure it would work.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disable legacy input, create your own legacy input events at low frequency</strong>. Another one in the category of “silly ideas that probably could work”, but there are a <em>lot</em> of legacy messages and this would be another support nightmare.</p></li><li><p><strong>Move everything else out of the thread that does the main message queue processing</strong>. This is something I would probably try if I was doing greenfield development, but it’s a massive change to make to an existing codebase, as in our porting use case. And it would still mean that this one thread is spending tons of time uselessly going through input messages.</p></li></ol><p>So option 1 and 2 would be somewhat viable, but the former doesn’t actually work, and the latter is not possible. The others are, in my opinion, too silly to explore for actually shipping a game, or infeasible for a porting project.</p><p>So perhaps now you can see both why there are AAA games shipping on PC which break with 8 kHz mice, and why I’m <em>just a bit</em> frustrated with the situation. So what are we actually doing?</p><h2 id="our-current-solution">Our Current Solution</h2><p>Our current solution is very dumb and seems like it shouldn’t work, or at least have some severe repercussions, but so far it does seem to work fine and not have any issues. It’s a bit of a hack, but it’s the best we’ve got so far.</p><p>This solution involves <strong>keeping legacy input enabled</strong>, but using <strong>batched raw input for actual game input</strong>. And then the stupid trick: <strong>prevent performance collapse by just not processing more than <code>N</code> message queue events per frame.</strong></p><p>We are currently working with <code>N=5</code>, but that’s a somewhat random choice. When I tried this I had a lot of concerns: what if tons of messages build up? What if the window becomes unresponsive? I didn’t worry about the game input itself, because we rapidly and with very low latency get all the buffered raw input events, but the window interactions might become unresponsive due to message buildup.</p><p>After quite a lot of testing with an 8 kHz mouse, none of that seems to happen, even if you really try to make it happen.</p><p>So, that’s where we are: an entirely unsatisfactory solution that seems to work fine, and provides 8k raw input without performance collapse and without affecting “legacy” windows interactions. If you know how to actually do this properly, please write a comment to this post, or failing that send an email, stop me in the street and tell me, or even send a carrier pigeon. I would be very grateful.</p><h2 id="a-note-on-xinput">A Note on XInput</h2><p>This is completely unrelated to the rest of the article, other than being about input, but I found it interesting and it might be new to some. When you use the XInput API to work with gamepads, you might think there is very little you can do wrong. It’s an exceedingly simple API, and mostly you just use <code>XInputGetState</code>. However, the documentation has this curious note, which is quite easy to miss:</p><blockquote><p>For performance reasons, don’t call XInputGetState for an ‘empty’ user slot every frame. We recommend that you space out checks for new controllers every few seconds instead.</p></blockquote><p>This is not an empty phrase: we have observed performance losses of 10-15% in extremely CPU-limited cases just by calling <code>XInputGetState</code> for all controllers every frame while none are connected!</p><p>I have no idea why the API would be designed like this, and not have some internal event-based tracking that makes calls for disconnected controller slots essentially free, but there you have it. You actually have to implement your own fallback mechanism to avoid this performance hit, since there’s no alternative API (at least in pure XInput) to tell you whether a controller is connected.</p><p>This is another area where an existing API is quite unsatisfactory – you generally want to avoid things that make every Nth frame take longer than the ones surrounding it, so you’d need to move all that to another thread. But it’s still much easier to deal with than the raw mouse input / high polling rate issue.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Game input in Windows ain’t great. I hope this article saves someone the time it took me to delve into this rabbit hole, and as I said above I’d love to hear from you if you know how to do this truly <strong>properly</strong>.</p><p><em>And we haven’t even gone into keyboard layouts yet!</em> Are you a QWERTZ user and have you ever wondered why some games have default bindings that have actions on e.g. <code>Z</code>, <code>X</code> and <code>C</code>, which makes no sense on your input device? But that’s a story for another day.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                  <p>Everything looks great. I have tried to generate an app that generates stupid faces. At first it produced an app that generates what looks like random images - coffee tables, nature, people, pens... I have tried fixing it by chatting. It suggested to add an AI routine to make sure I'll be getting stupid faces. It broke itself and started to produce error messages instead of images. I have asked it to fix itself. It has added error handling, better error messages, and stupid face generation success rate bar to the UI, but I have never been able to generate a stupid face. Great idea though, and hopefully some day it will work.</p>

                  <p>thanks for trying it out! I guess everything is fine in your code and just needed to direct the prompt a bit in the actual code (there is a tab 'code editor'). it's a bit what we're trying to improve. The AI gets 98% of stuff correctly, but for example here it missed to adjust the prompt to output stupid face generation - which literally takes 10 seconds to do in the code.</p>

In any dev process there needs to be a review step somewhere. Someone who understands code well needs to be looking at what the app is doing and making sure it's protecting my data. Someone needs to make sure there isn't a bug that loses the work I put in to creating records with a CRUD operation. They need to be making sure my privacy is respected in a legally compliant way. They need to make sure things are reasonably secure. None of that is guaranteed when you have a dev team, but it is a possibility at least.</p><p>Telling Joe Random "describe you app in a prompt and press deploy!" guarantees that <i>isn't</i> happening. This sort of service is great for non-dev people who want to launch something but it's a pretty big threat to my data.</p><p>I'm under no illusion that these services are going to be huge, and no doubt someone will sell an app built with one to a service that puts data about me into it.

                  <p>I'm playing a bit of both sides here. I do think it's interesting that we so automatically feel like the cases are different. I used something old because I think we understand it well and I do think in the elevator case our instincts are pretty justified. The fact that we can add sensors and get near 100% reliability is a big part of why in that case it isn't very reasonable, but ML is statistical. It's not the kind of thing that you fix by adding one more sensor or one more if statement. I think some anti ML people use that to mean it's unworkable, but I'd hate to hold off on replacing drivers for example just because the kind of errors that a robo taxi makes feel more like in theory they would have been avoidable with better training while we just go and forgive drivers for letting their mind wander for a second</p>

AI to replace full stack developers, and it will overwhelmingly succeed.</p><p>There are two reasons why this is predictable with high confidence.  None of the more accurate predictions rest upon the trendiness of AI, but instead are vested in the current capabilities of the people primed for replacement and prior employment trends.</p><p>Reason 1.  Most, certainly not all, full stack developers are paid far too much for what they deliver.  Over the past year I have been seeing many interview referrals for just under $200k even though I live in a very low cost of living area of the US.  I have turned all of these down despite currently making far less.  The high compensation is not enough to make up for working in a team that has no hope deliver to expectations (more on that in the second point) and is hostile to radical change.</p><p>Reason 2. Prior employment trends suggest that many employers prioritize hiring and candidate compatibility over ability to deliver.  Its a valid business decision that makes sense in the short term, but results in catastrophic debt over the long term.  You have to understand that developers are a cost center and not sales people.  This means they cost money and do not generate profit, so it makes sense to lower the costs of acquiring these people as much as possible.</p><p>Starting about a year or two after I started doing full time JavaScript programming in the corporate space employers started looking at solutions to turn developers into commodities because they were spending too much on hiring with disappointing results.  I can remember the entire industry trying to do this on both the front end and back end, but the movement received far less penetration on the back end, which was more entrenched.  It received overwhelming success on the front end with tool suites like prototype.js and YUI before jQuery formed a dominating cult of personality.  Then once Node got popular and the browsers got faster those front end libraries were largely replaced by large MVC frameworks like Angular and React.</p><p>Before the strong focus on external tool libraries JavaScript developers had to do it all themselves.  At that time the browsers were too slow for things like Photopea, but the first large browser apps were already rolling out.  These were some really excellent developers, but it was really hard to find people who could perform at that level, and of course the pay was ridiculously low.  Moving to these external libraries really opened up hiring to people who could not perform otherwise, and that really lowered the cost of candidate selection.  Unfortunately, these external libraries were generally slow and sometimes broke when they were just expected to work, but now you had an entire work force that could not live without them.</p><p>Reliance upon external tools to keep your job creates insecurity.  It limits the availability of design options to what a given set of tools allow, and developer's first priority at work is to retain employment.  That insecurity grows over time as applications grow larger, solution delivery slows, developers get further and further more reliant upon solutions in conflict with the desires of the business's profit generators.  Its why a lot of people I have talked to over the past year moved on to other things and refuse to go back despite the far higher compensation.</p></div></td></tr>

Typically speed of delivery was faster using a framework solution only if the exact solution were already written and available as an extension.  In absolutely every other case software originally written in house was always faster to deliver back to the business.  This is because with original software the developers are not limited by prior existing conventions.  It always comes down to the prior experience and confidence of a given set of developers.</p><p>The business knows this before assigning the tasks to the development team, and that awareness (more than anything else) determines the opportunities for developers to identify their own speed of delivery.  Most development teams are entirely unaware of just how thoroughly their performance is measured from a business perspective.  That should be painfully obvious, because developers only cost money, and those costs go straight to the bottom line.</p></div></td></tr>

I mean, if that were true, then what would be the point in hiring a web developer in the first place? Some sort of weird nepotistic makework scheme? Again, if that's your perspective…</p><p>In my world, clients come to me with a web site and a problem (or no web site and the problem of "I don't have a web site"), we agree on contract terms, and I solve their problem. If I do a good job at it (and I <i>want</i> to do a good job at it, because solving problems and making clients happy feels good while failing at that feels really bad), the client finds value in my work and they will come back to me the next time they have another problem that needs solving. It's that simple. Nobody's hiring me because of "candidate compatibility" and then throwing a bunch of money at me to do nothing.</p><p>At least in the short term, I'm not too worried about AI taking my job, because, as stated elsewhere, it's not yet good enough to do more than the least complex of tasks, and as one tries to get it to do more complex things, the odds that it will hit a brick wall due to a bug it can't code its way around or a creative understanding it can't unravel increase - so these sorts of tools might actually end up creating more work for more experienced professionals like myself (although I don't necessarily look forward to the days where I'm regularly being hired to unravel a plate of ChatGPT spaghetti). But even more than that, I feel like a good deal of the value I provide is in being able to talk to a client about what they want the site to do, how it will earn them money, and foresee potential problems or offer better solutions based on my experience - to answer questions that they didn't think to ask, and ask questions of my own to make sure we're on the same page on things. A client just giving me a description of what they want built followed by me just building it? That never happens. There's always discussion and back-and-forth to nail down details and make sure the site is as good as it possibly can be. So long as clients see the value in that, and until AI can do that sort of thing, I'm not sweating it.</p></div></td></tr>
