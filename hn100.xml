<p>
  The late <a href="https://multicians.org/multicians.html#Bensoussan" title="Multician: Designer (GE/CISL): File manager, Initialization, AIM, NSS.">André Bensoussan</a> worked with me on the Multics operating system at Honeywell in Cambridge. 
  We were working on a <a href="https://multicians.org/mgn.html#NSS" title="glossary: New Storage System. MR 4.0 included a rewritten storage...">major change</a> to the file system, 
  which required a subsystem, the <a href="https://multicians.org/mgv.html#VTOC" title="glossary: Volume Table of Contents. Region of a physical volume...">VTOC</a> manager, 
  to manage file description information. 
  It had to transport the file information between disk and memory,
  manage a shared memory buffer pool, 
  and manage space on disk for the information. 
  In other words, it was a small virtual memory manager.
</p>

<p>
  André took on the job of design, implementation, and test of the VTOC manager.
  He started by sitting at his desk and drawing a lot of diagrams. 
  I was the project coordinator, 
  so I used to drop in on him and ask how things were going. 
  "Still designing," he'd say. 
  He wanted the diagrams to look beautiful and symmetrical as well as capturing all the state information.
  I was getting nervous about the schedule, 
  so I was glad when he finally began writing code.
  He wrote in pencil, at his desk, instead of using a terminal.
  He declined offers of typing help, and just kept writing away in pencil.
  He rewrote parts, copied things over, erased and rewrote.
</p>

<p>
  Finally André took his neat final pencil copy to a terminal and typed the whole program in.
  His first compilation attempt failed; he corrected three typos, tried again, and the code compiled. 
  We bound it into the system and tried it out, and it worked the first time.
</p>

<p>
  In fact, <a href="https://multicians.org/vtoc_man.html" title="PL/I source of the Multics storage system VTOC manager.">the VTOC manager</a> worked perfectly from then on.
  Only one bug was ever found in it, and that was my fault: 
  André had asked me the calling sequence for an error procedure, 
  and I'd guessed instead of looking it up, so it crashed the first time it hit an error. 
  Beyond that the program was perfect.
</p>

<p>
  How did André do this, with no tool but a pencil?
</p>

native applications written in languages such as C, C++, Rust, or Go. Its main
purpose is to help developers identify the performance bottlenecks of a complex
application. Orbit can be also used to visualize the execution flow of such
applications.</p>
<p dir="auto">The key differentiator with many existing tools is that no alteration to the
target process is necessary. Orbit does not require you to change a single line
of code. It doesn't require you to recompile or even relaunch the application
you want to profile. Everything is done seamlessly, right when you need it. It
requires zero integration time and zero iteration time.</p>
<p dir="auto">Orbit combines sampling and dynamic instrumentation to optimize the profiling
workflow. Sampling can quickly identify interesting functions to instrument.
Dynamic instrumentation results in exact function entry and exit information
which is presented in the form of per-thread hierarchical call graphs.
Manual instrumentation markers can be added to the source code and further
allows for value-tracking. Scheduling events are also shown to visualize when a
thread was running and on what core. Furthermore, Orbit visualizes thread
dependencies, showing which thread got blocked or unblocked by which other
thread. For AMD GPUs, the submission, scheduling and hardware execution timings
of a job is visualized. Additional GPU data, such as Vulkan debug markers can be
retrieved using Orbit's Vulkan layer. Memory consumption and page-fault
information is visualized as well.</p>
<p dir="auto">An introduction to Orbit's key features can be found in the following YouTube
video:

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Note</h3>
<p dir="auto">Orbit's focus has shifted to the Linux version. Windows local profiling is
currently only supported partially and major features, such as dynamic
instrumentation, are not yet implemented. It is possible however to profile
Linux executables from a Windows UI instance. For Windows local profiling,
you can still use the released
<a href="https://github.com/google/orbit/releases">binaries</a>, but please note that
they are deprecated and mostly undocumented.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Build</h2>
<p dir="auto">Please have a look at the first three sections of our
<a href="https://github.com/google/orbit/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md">development documentation</a>. It describes how to build Orbit and
which compilers, platforms, and tools are supported and needed.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Workflow</h2>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> An extensive documentation of the usage of Orbit can be found in our
<a href="https://github.com/google/orbit/blob/main/documentation/DOCUMENTATION.md">usage documentation</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The following describes the basic workflow of Orbit:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Select a process in the list of currently running processes in the connection
setup dialog, and click <strong>Start Session</strong>.</li>
<li>The list of loaded modules will appear at the top of the <strong>Symbols</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Orbit tries to automatically retrieve debug information of the modules.
See <a href="https://github.com/google/orbit/blob/main/documentation/DOCUMENTATION.md#load-symbols">here</a> on how to load
symbols for modules Orbit failed to load. For successfully loaded module
symbols, the <strong>Functions</strong> tab will get populated.</li>
<li>Select functions you wish to dynamically instrument in the <strong>Functions</strong> tab
by <kbd>Right-Click</kbd> and choosing <strong>Hook</strong>.</li>
<li>Start profiling by pressing <kbd>F5</kbd>. To stop profiling, press
<kbd>F5</kbd> again. You can either zoom time using <kbd>W</kbd> and
<kbd>S</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + the scroll wheel. You can also
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Right-Click</kbd> and drag to zoom to a specific time
range. To scale the UI, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>+</kbd>/<kbd>-</kbd>.
Press <kbd>SPACE</kbd> to see the last 2 seconds of capture.</li>
<li>You can select sections of the per-thread sampling event track to get a
sampling report of your selection.</li>
</ol>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Presets</h2>
<p dir="auto">Once you have loaded the debug information for your modules and have chosen
functions of interest to dynamically instrument, you can save your profiling
preset so that you won't have to do this manually again. To save a preset, go to
<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save Preset</strong></p>

Ｂｉｔｗｉｓｅ 📼 Ｌｉｍｉｎａｌ
A Short Film in 256 Bytes of Code

Programmed by KilledByAPixel
Presented at Lovebyte Party 2024

...

I found an old VHS tape at a yard sale.
It was labeled "Bitwise Liminal" in sharpie.
But when I watched the video it was only static.

Then I started having vivid and... unsettling dreams.
Also I couldn't stop thinking about that weird VHS tape.
After researching I learned it was a digital backup.
Using some special software I recovered the data.
To my shock, it was a 256 byte program...

With trembling hands I opened it in a web browser.
Strange. This reminds me of the dreams I've been having.
Now I don't need to sleep anymore.
I just keep watching.

<figure><a href="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/world-map-vectortiles.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/world-map-vectortiles-1024x683.png" alt="World map showing pixels in one half, vectors in the other, with an arrow pointing towards vectors" srcset="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/world-map-vectortiles-1024x683.png 1024w, https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/world-map-vectortiles-300x200.png 300w, https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/world-map-vectortiles-768x512.png 768w, https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/world-map-vectortiles-624x416.png 624w, https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/world-map-vectortiles.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>OpenStreetMap will take a large leap forward with the introduction of vector tiles on&nbsp;<a href="http://openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">openstreetmap.org</a>&nbsp;this year. This is the first of a series of blog posts where we will share our progress.</p>



<p>Vector tiles represent a significant advancement in how map data is processed and presented. Unlike traditional raster tiles, which are&nbsp;<a href="https://tile.openstreetmap.org/0/0/0.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">static images</a>&nbsp;with pixels, vector tiles are like the ‘SVGs’ of the mapping world: you get lines and points. This stores geodata in a format that allows for dynamic styling and interactivity, enabling the user to adapt the visual appearance of the map without altering the data. If that sounds like what you’ve seen on other maps, you are right! Vector tiles have become industry standard in interactive maps that, unlike&nbsp;<a href="http://openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">openstreetmap.org</a>, don’t get updated often, and where you can simply recalculate your whole database occasionally.</p>



<p>But the map displayed on&nbsp;<a href="http://openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">openstreetmap.org</a>&nbsp;are quite uniquely different! They get updated incrementally and constantly, a minute after you edit; it’s a critical part of the feedback loop to mappers – and how the author of this blog post got hooked in the first place. This is why we have to invest in our own vector tile software stack.</p>



<p>In the direct future, for users, this will mean a new, modern-looking map style with seamless zoom on&nbsp;<a href="http://openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">openstreetmap.org</a>. Looking further ahead, the most exciting part is what this vector tile project will make easy for volunteers and tile users: 3d maps, more efficient data mixing and matching and integration of other datasets, thematic styles, multilingual maps, different views for administrative boundaries, interactive points of interest, more accessible maps for vision-impaired users, and I’m sure many other ideas that no one has come up with yet. This technology is not just a leap in aesthetics, but also in functionality, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>



<p>To lead our vector tiles project, the OpenStreetMap Foundation has hired Paul Norman, a renowned figure in cartography and open data, whose journey with OpenStreetMap began in 2010 with a chance encounter on the xkcd forums. His role in the community took off with his work on OpenStreetMap Carto in 2013. His volunteer involvement with the OSM Foundation, including contributions to several working groups and a tenure on the OSMF board, highlights his commitment to the project. Professionally, he has held various influential positions at MapQuest, CartoDB, Wikimedia Foundation, and Amazon. Billions have seen the products of his work. To read more from Paul, visit his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paulnorman.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a>&nbsp;for technical deep dives into vector tiles, follow him on&nbsp;<a href="https://en.osm.town/@pnorman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mastodon</a>&nbsp;or on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/penorman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>.</p>



<p>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://osmfoundation.org/w/images/2/27/2021_survey_slides.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2021 community survey</a>&nbsp;(page 15), there was no clear sentiment on what the foundation should do on vector tiles. We noticed a split in preferences: some advocated for volunteer-led development, others for professional engagement. The ecosystem has evolved since then, making it easier to build on top of existing software bricks. We see our project as a reasonable balance between the two most popular answers. Investing in core software is also&nbsp;<a href="https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Strategic_Plan#Strengthen_maintenance_and_feature_development_of_core_software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part of our multi-year strategic plan</a>.</p>



<p>The OpenStreetMap Foundation depends on donations to finish this project. If you would like to support our year of vector tiles specifically, you can&nbsp;<a href="https://supporting.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">donate</a>&nbsp;and leave ‘vector tiles’ in the donation message. Every contribution, large or small, directly supports our ability to ensure that OpenStreetMap can be open, accessible and dynamic for all. Your support is not just a donation; it’s an investment in the future of open-source mapping.</p>



<p>We’re just at the beginning of this exciting journey. Stay tuned as we will delve deeper into the schema and style aspects in future blog posts.</p>

<p>There’s an old joke about a guy who murders his parents, then throws himself on the mercy of the court because he’s an orphan.&nbsp;</p> <p>A variant of this thinking is becoming an accepted strategy at major entertainment corporations like Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), which adopted a scorched earth brand of accounting after its 2022 merger that sought to reduce debt by using drastic measures. One of WBD’s most notorious post-merger decisions was deleting an entire finished feature, “<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-batgirl-cancellation-why-it-happened-the-social-media-fallout-and-more">Batgirl</a>,” that had an estimated budget of $90 million, to claim a tax write-off, deeming it bad-to-the-point of un-releasability (how they could prove this when no one outside the production had seen it remains a mystery worthy of Benoit Blanc).&nbsp;</p>
</section>

<section>
 <p>The company seems determined to do it again with another one of their productions, the live-action/animation hybrid “Coyote vs. Acme,” a comedy based on a <em>New Yorker</em> humor piece about Wile E. Coyote suing the Acme corporation that reportedly cost $70 million, co-starring <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/john-cena">John Cena</a> and <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/will-forte">Will Forte</a>, directed by <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/dave-green">Dave Green</a>. The film was already done and had performed exceptionally with test audiences <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/coyote-vs-acme-crew-blindsided-by-warner-bros-killing-movie-1234873156/">(in the high 90s, according to a <em>Rolling Stone </em>article</a>) when it was earmarked for deletion last November so that the company could claim a tax write-off, as they had done with “Batgirl”.&nbsp;</p> <p>To my knowledge, the company has never given anyone a justification beyond debt reduction and a bit of vague gesticulation toward a corporate vision that the film supposedly didn’t sync with. Public outcry caused the company to <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/coyote-vs-acme-decision-reversed-warner-bros/">backpedal</a> in November 2023 and say that they would sell the movie elsewhere, but Drew Taylor of <em>The Wrap</em> <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/coyote-vs-acme-update-offers-warner-bros/">has reported</a> that the company never entertained any negotiations about their asking price, demanding not a penny less than $70 to $80 million for the privilege of owning a project that they would only gain $30 million by scrubbing from their own ledgers. The offer to sell the film was, to put it mildly, not undertaken in good faith. It appears that the company would rather take less money by writing off the movie than sell it for even a few dollars more than that, because they might risk having a rival turn it into a success, which would further embarrass them for never even having tried to market it themselves, even though it was built around “intellectual property” (i.e., adorable cartoon characters) that are as inextricably linked with Warner Bros. <a href="https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/france-facts/symbols-of-the-republic/article/marianne#:~:text=Marianne%20represents%20the%20permanent%20values,Liberty%2C%20Equality%2C%20Fraternity%22.&amp;text=The%20earliest%20representations%20of%20a,time%20of%20the%20French%20Revolution.">as Marianne is with the nation of France</a>.</p> <p>It’s not just the completed film that gets deleted in cases like this, but everything associated with the film, which means that nobody who did any sort of work on a project that consumed years of their lives will ever be able to point to it as evidence of what sort of work they’re capable of doing, and get more work. At least when a real estate company demolishes a completed building before anyone’s had a chance to move into it, there are photos of what it looked like. “With this write-off, everything gets deleted, not just what you see on screen, but everything that it took to make the film,” the film’s editor Carsten Kaparnek told <em>Rolling Stone</em> at the time. “A released movie is just the tip of a giant iceberg of love and labor. The talent and commitment of the people who bring a project to life should not go unnoticed … All of it is now lost but will never be forgotten by those lucky enough to have been there.” (<a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/warner-bros-discovery/shelving-movies-tax-write-off-coyote-vs-acme-warner-bros">As Jacob Oller pointed out in an article for <em>Paste</em></a>, in the old celluloid days, studios or filmmakers who tried to do this had to burn a negative.)</p>

 <figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/65c69da3306fcc6a1eb49028/content_coyote-vs-acme2.jpg" data-image="[object Object]"></figure> <p>Some of the company’s tactics post-merger were garden-variety ruthless,<a href="https://www.indiewire.com/gallery/removed-hbo-max-movies-shows-warner-bros-discovery-merger-list/"> like eliminating 87 series</a> from its streaming platform Max, so that they won’t have to pay union-mandated residuals to the talent that created already-existing programs or pony up funds to produce more seasons of existing ones (such as “Our Flag Means Death,” one of the company’s most popular and critically acclaimed comedies—<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/our-flag-means-death-canceled#:~:text=Max%20announced%20on%20Tuesday%20that,island%2C%20wrapped%20on%20October%2026.">canceled after just two seasons</a>). Other decisions appear coldly pragmatic at first glance but reveal themselves as counterproductive after a closer look, like offloading formerly exclusive HBO productions like “Band of Brothers” to Netflix or cutting the number of available Looney Tunes and offering them to rivals (those characters are literal mascots for the company; imagine Disney+ doing the same with Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy cartoons, and the horrified reaction of devotees of that brand). Taken to extremes, the mentality is the equivalent of trying to get your weight down by slicing off fingers, toes and ears. The number on the bathroom scale is reduced, but the corporate body politic is traumatized from shock and blood loss, and nobody considered the long-term health ramifications.</p> <p>It has been pointed out to me that companies own things and therefore can do whatever they want with them. Being an American, I’m aware of that position.&nbsp;</p> <p>But I’m also aware that—in theory, at least—governments exist (in part) to regulate corporations, in order to stop them from doing things that are deleterious or destructive to the public good and to individuals who work for them. They have the means and motive to step in, whether declaring certain kinds of waste dumping to be illegal, trying to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Anti-Corruption_Act">prevent private companies from bribing or otherwise influencing public officials</a>, or mandating that TV networks cannot blast the volume of ads to make them audible to viewers who leave the room during commercial breaks. (Yes, that last thing is real; it’s legislation known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Advertisement_Loudness_Mitigation_Act#:~:text=2847)%20(CALM%20Act)%20requires,and%20Maintaining%20Audio%20Loudness%20for">CALM Act</a>.)&nbsp;</p> <p>They should do something similar for all types of media. The template could be the moral rights of artists in some European markets, which you can read about at length <a href="https://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1234&amp;context=pilr">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>A selective adaptation of that idea for the United States is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Artists_Rights_Act">Visual Artists Rights Act</a> of 1990, which smart lawyers might want to look into. Among other things, it grants artists “the right to prevent distortion, mutilation, or modification that would prejudice the author's honor or reputation.”</p> <p>Whatever the technical legality of writing off completed films and destroying them for pennies on the dollar, it’s morally reprehensible: Oller memorably calls it “an accounting assassination.” Defending it on grounds that it’s not illegal is bootlicking.&nbsp;</p>

 <p>The practice also has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/magazine/david-zaslav-warner-media-discovery.html">a whiff of the plot of Mel Brooks’s “The Producers</a>”. The original idea of Brooks’ hustler protagonists Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom was to mount a play so awful that it would close immediately, and they can live off the unspent money they raised from bilking old ladies. When the show unexpectedly becomes a hit, they blow up the theater.&nbsp;</p> <p>The biggest difference between the plot of “The Producers” and what happened to “Batgirl” and “Coyote vs Acme” is that in “The Producers,” the public got to see the play. </p>

Its technologies and best practices are getting more widely deployed, both to more companies and more broadly inside of companies.</p><p>This is the phase of any cycle where the real work gets done and where the real value gets created. It’s the phase for getting living in the trenches and solving real problems. The MDS was the future five years ago and it’s still the future today, but we actually have to roll up our sleeves to make the replatforming happen.</p></blockquote><p><span>Over the last month this has been bugging me. I don’t know if you’ve ever had that nagging feeling after writing something that </span><em>just doesn’t feel right</em><span>, but writing this knocked something loose in my head. Since then, I’ve become a little obsessed with the question: </span><strong>what’s going on with the modern data stack?</strong><span> </span></p><p><span>I became increasingly confident that </span><em>something</em><span> had changed. Sure, it was easy to point to the superficial changes. But I felt like there was a more interesting narrative to tell, and as both </span><a href="https://www.getdbt.com/blog/future-of-the-modern-data-stack" rel="">a historian of this technology wave</a><span> and a founder responsible for navigating it, I wanted to nail this down. I caught up with a bunch of folks I respect, from founders to practitioners to VCs, and want to use this newsletter as a way to share my current thinking. I can’t share all of my datapoints on the current state of the world (many of them are proprietary) but I’ll share as much as I can. </span></p><p>Let’s start at the beginning.</p><p>In 2016, the modern data stack was a well-defined idea. </p><p>It was never an industry or a software category or a Gartner Magic Quadrant. When the data community started using this term it simply meant a set of products that a) redesigned the analytics workflow to take advantage of the cloud and b) all interacted with one another via SQL. </p><p>Looker was one of the classic examples. BI built for Redshift, taking advantage of the inherent performance and scalability improvements native to that platform. The idea that you could have a mature BI solution without any local processing or caching was novel in 2013.</p><p>Fivetran and dbt are also classic examples. The cloud meant that ETL should be rebuilt as ELT, which created a dramatically new, lower-cost, lower-friction, more accessible way of doing this critical, but traditionally very painful, data work.</p><p><span>The MDS: </span><em>analytics products, designed to take advantage of the cloud, interacting via SQL</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>In 2016, when I </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-steps-tools-setting-up-modern-saas-based-bi-tristan-handy/" rel="">started talking about this</a><span>, the fact that a product had been designed to take advantage of the cloud was important. It created massive differentiation for those products—many ran circles around pre-existing products because they were built from scratch with totally different priors.</span></p><p>When I was a consultant, helping small companies build analytics capabilities, I would only work with MDS tooling. It was so much better that I simply wouldn’t take on a project if the client wanted to use pre-cloud tools. I, and others like me, needed a way to talk about this preference, to differentiate between these new products and all of the other ones that we didn’t want to use. The term actually conveyed important information.</p><p>Today, most data products are built for the cloud. Either they have been built in the past ten years and therefore baked in cloud-first assumptions, or they have been re-architected to do so. </p><p><a href="https://medium.com/fishtown-analytics/is-looker-the-right-business-intelligence-tool-for-my-company-afc1f750a0f9" rel="">Another of my posts from 2016</a><span> compares Looker and Tableau, and criticizes Tableau for not being able to effectively process certain types of data (particularly clickstream data). This was true…</span><em>in 2016</em><span>. Tableau’s Redshift integration back then was quite bad; the SQL that it wrote was not at all performant on large datasets. This should not be surprising because nearly all data processing in Tableau happened via local extracts at the time. Tableau on top of clickstream data wasn’t really a thing, as prior to Redshift </span><em>almost no BI tech </em><span>could handle clickstream data and users didn’t expect this. </span></p><p><span>So: in 2016, differentiating between Looker (MDS) and Tableau (pre-MDS) was useful. But 8 years later, with the explosion of data processing happening in the cloud, Tableau has evolved. I’m sure it wasn’t easy for the Tableau team to go on its cloud journey, but it is one that </span><em>most</em><span> pre-cloud data companies have gone through. I have talked to the founders of so many of these companies and “migrating to the cloud” is almost always this harrowing bet-the-company march through the desert. But it’s so existential that everyone does it anyway (or dies trying).</span></p><p>So—does that mean that Tableau “joined the modern data stack” once it improved its cloud-native capabilities? Not…really? I don’t think anyone would say “Tableau is a modern data stack company.” But then…what information is the MDS designation really conveying at this point? The useful information content that existed in 2016 is no longer present.</p><p>Of course, as with many ideas, we didn’t stop using the term just because it stopped conveying the same information content. Instead, the MDS morphed from a descriptive term into a meme. </p><p>I worried we had hit peak MDS when I went to big investment banker conference and a very senior banker said something like “the market can’t get enough of all of these modern data stack companies!” I was confused, because a) I was in the community that coined that term, and b) there were no publicly-traded MDS companies I knew of aside from Snowflake. So, I asked him what companies he was referring to. He mentioned Mongo, Datadog, and Confluent. </p><p>Now, all of these are great companies that I look up to and respect. But…these are not “modern data stack” companies as far as I understood the term.</p><p>What had happened here is that, circa 2021, the MDS had officially jumped the shark. From 2020 to 2022, the meteoric rise of Snowflake and Databricks and a few other companies had caused (mostly private market) investors to go all-in on this market trend in a way that very rarely happens. And so being a “modern data stack” company was valuable. Just like an index fund needs to hold a certain % in each stock in the index, every VC needed exposure to the MDS trend. And this euphoria bled into public market investors who sought out whatever exposure they could get.</p><p>But it wasn’t just about investor sentiment. Investor sentiment was driven by real adoption trends, and in turn drove press interest, and then further customer awareness and adoption. The number of enterprise CDOs who woke up to the MDS in that 3-year period was incredible, and it was driven by this cycle of early-adopters &gt; investors &gt; press coverage &gt; more adopters.</p><p>This is not a bad thing! This is just how enterprise tech works. But along the way, the phrase lost its attachment to the underlying information it was conveying. It was no longer describing some specific trait that products like Looker and Fivetran and dbt had and others didn’t, it was just…a meme. A market trend.</p><p>And once a trend gains momentum, it can become self-fulfilling.</p><p>Imagine it’s 2021, peak MDS, and you meet the CDO of a large bank. “Oh cool,” she says, “you’re the CEO of a tech company. What does your product do?” What do you say?</p><ol><li><p>“We build a tool that leverages the power of the cloud to apply standard SQL and software engineering best practices to the historically mundane (but critical!) job of data transformation.”</p></li><li><p>“We’re the standard for data transformation in the modern data stack.” </p></li></ol><p>I will tell you that, empirically, option #2 is more effective. And that wasn’t just true for me, it was likely true for every founder building products in the space. Investors and buyers both understand what you meant faster and better if you relate your product to trends they are already familiar with. </p><p><span>So once the MDS had become a part of the lexicon for VCs and CDOs and bankers, founders had every reason to claim the moniker for their own products. This isn’t a </span><em>problem </em><span>(or a conspiracy!), this is just how capitalism and ideas work.</span></p><p>This is when the vendor ecosystem in the modern data stack reached peak collaboration. The end-to-end problem was far too big for any one startup to solve, and so swim lanes were established and partnership ruled the day. </p><p>There was a lot of valuable co-marketing, partnership deals, co-sponsored events, and co-selling. This had real value for everyone involved—customers and vendors alike. Companies voluntarily integrated their products together, cross-promoted each other publicly, and built partnerships that made owning and operating these technologies far easier for customers.</p><p>And, with clearly defined swim lanes and a need to create ‘better together’ stories to sell a complete solution, companies had a real route to market for their products as a part of this industry trend. If you built something great that solved problems for both partners and customers, you could get initial traction with partner-led sales pretty easily.</p><p>This was a beautiful thing. Private capital fueling founders, who not only built their own products but were consciously coming together to build an ecosystem, leading to the rapid buildout of interoperable products all taking advantage of a new technology platform (the cloud). </p><p>But eventually the party stopped, and it stopped for two reasons:</p><ol><li><p>The changing market environment impacted both buyer and investor behaviors</p></li><li><p>AI crowds out the MDS as the primary industry trend in data</p></li></ol><p>The market shifted in two ways: investor behavior changed and buyer behavior changed. Simultaneously. One of these things changing is disruptive; both of them changing at the same time is enough to reshuffle the whole deck.</p><p><span>On investor behavior: modern data stack companies were getting epic valuations up through EOY2021 / into early 2022. dbt Labs was certainly a part of this! At the peak, valuations reached 100x forward ARR. Investors said: estimate what your annual recurring revenue will be in 12 months, multiply that by 100, and that’s how we’ll value the company. That is </span><em>historically</em><span> aggressive. It reflects not only the belief in the MDS market trend on the part of investors, but also the very real search for growth on the part of investors during the zero interest rate era (ZIRP).</span></p><p><span>As inflation climbed and interest rates adjusted upwards </span><em>very quickly</em><span> during 2022, the market reset. Private multiples are now more like 10-20x forward revenue, so dropping 80%+.</span></p><p>Basically all MDS companies were/are VC-backed. And when valuations are high, companies have the capital to invest in sales, marketing, R&amp;D, community teams, everything. With plenty of capital, partnership teams are large, everyone has bandwidth to do comarketing events, and there are engineers to build integrations. </p><p>As capital becomes scarce and efficiency is in the crosshairs, companies cut all but the most essential activities. Even if every MDS company were long-term healthy, much of the ecosystem dynamic dies without these investments. Companies put their heads down and focus on the fundamentals.</p><p>Changes in buyer behavior are at least as impactful. CFOs took a scalpel to data budgets, looking to save money on both headcount and software spend. The euphemism “cloud optimization” has been used extensively over the past ~18 months on earnings calls to describe this behavior, and it’s often the smallest companies with the most nascent products that get cut first. Even in customer relationships that lasted through this period, many experienced reduced contract sizes as layoffs impacted many, many data teams. </p><p>All of this hurt growth for all software companies, and it hurt the smallest ones the most. These companies had the smallest balance sheets, smallest customer lists, just generally the least resources to weather the storm. Some of these companies have gone away already; some live on but are shells of their former selves.</p><p>Companies in the top quartile are still significantly impacted. Where they may have all once felt they had a clear path to long-term independence, many are now questioning that. They’re doing fine, but wondering what their 5 year path looks like.</p><p>Even the most financially successful few companies in the MDS (and I’d count us as one of them) likely had a challenging year last year amidst all of these changes. All of us have retooled for growth in a different environment but are fortunate to have strong product-market fit in important categories—this has allowed us to make these adjustments and come out the other side strong.</p><p>Finally, as a result of all of this pressure on data spend, buyers developed a strong preference to buy integrated solutions rather than to buy many tools to construct a stack. Buyer willingness to construct a stack from 8-12 vendors has declined significantly. Companies are much more likely today to expect to buy 2-4 products as the core of their analytics infrastructure. This creates yet more pressure for consolidation, and will likely drive more M&amp;A activity and competition across the vendor landscape.</p><p>Overall: what once was a collaborative modern data stack ecosystem full of startups and growth and comarketing and event sponsorships has been supplanted by a bunch of companies focused on executing and where partnerships are still important but only when they have clearly-demonstrated ROI.</p><p><span>This is all very natural, and long-term for the best! But </span><em>the vibes, they are a-changin’</em><span>.</span></p><p>A market trend is only as relevant as the attention it commands and the investor behavior it drives. </p><p>The MDS was a big, important market trend. But AI is bigger. A lot bigger. And it’s hard for data investors and data buyers to focus on too many trends at once.</p><p><span>This means that, </span><strong>even though AI and the MDS are highly complimentary</strong><span>, the massive attention being paid to AI right now detracts from the MDS as an industry trend. This is just a fact. You can likely see this in your own experience over the last couple of years, and it shows up in a million ways in my day-to-day.</span></p><p>And you know what? I’m more than ok with that. It’s fun to be at the center of the world for a little while.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  


  <p>I love my <a href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2">Remarkable 2</a>. I’ve been using it pretty heavily for almost a year now. It’s my every day companion device. Here’s some notes and ideas.</p>

<p><em>Note: this is all my personal opinion, I have no ties to Remarkable. Although they are <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2024/01/18/dream-clients/">one of my dream clients for 2024</a> so there’s that.</em></p>

<p>✍️✍️✍️</p>

<h2 id="the-remarkable-is-great-at-reading--writing-and-arithmetic">The Remarkable is Great at Reading &amp; Writing (and Arithmetic!)</h2>

<p>What do I use my Remarkable for? The three R’s - reading, writing and arithmetic.</p>

<p>Core, daily usage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Taking notes, capturing ideas, jotting down the day’s todo list. All of the kinds of things that a notebook does for you.</li>
  <li>Doodling, diagramming and constructing more involved elaborate ideas. The kind of thing that is hard to do on a notebook because it involves zooming in and out, erasing sections, using straight lines etc.</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow/status/1754690464156946652">Reading PDFs</a> (and annotating with notes) - what a perfect form factor for reading PDFs! I’ve read so many more academic papers over the last year directly because of my Remarkable.</li>
  <li>I’ve been working with a client to make a Monthly Business Review packet - it’s 50+ pages of charts and data, Amazon-style, and on a whim I loaded it onto my Remarkable as a PDF and it’s a great way to read all the data (and add little annotations!). Now I load each month on there and sit down and read it front to back.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fun, quirky uses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Helping my daughter Roxy with her maths homework! I find that explaining things like mathematical concepts in a space where you can easily erase, switch pages etc is useful. Roxy and I did that last night as I was helping her understand place value for tens and hundreds.</li>
  <li>There are various game templates for the Remarkable that you can buy but I prefer to play something like <a href="https://athriftymom.com/pencil-wars-drawing-game/">drawing wars</a> with my kids!</li>
</ul>

<p>And here’s a recent usage that I’m really digging - constructing a custom project tracker for my book writing project:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomcritchlow.com/images/2024-02-09-11-09-19.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The base layer is a PDF I made in Figma that then lets me track editing progress as I work through my <a href="https://buttondown.email/winterwordcraft">Winter of Word Craft</a> book sprint.</p>

<p>✍️✍️✍️</p>



<p>I’ve also been playing around recently with some fun remarkable templates - things that work great on a drawing device. Like Wardly Maps:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomcritchlow.com/images/2024-02-09-11-17-56.png" alt=""></p>

<p>And <a href="https://smithery.com/2020/12/01/starting-with-zenko-mapping/">Zenko maps</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomcritchlow.com/images/2024-02-09-11-18-19.png" alt=""></p>

<p>One thing I want to do is load up some sheet music on it (well, first I have to learn how to read sheet music. Actually maybe I should put a piano key template on there and I can just color in the keys I need to play…)</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you can play this and tell me what song it is i have a project I want to work on together with you <a href="https://t.co/d30KMj0dKU">pic.twitter.com/d30KMj0dKU</a></p>— Toby (@tobyshorin) <a href="https://twitter.com/tobyshorin/status/1719857006608031884?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2023</a></blockquote>


<p>✍️✍️✍️</p>



<p>Here’s some ideas I’d <em>love</em>:</p>

<p>I work with my Remarkable template right next to my laptop screen every day. It functions a lot like a second screen - except getting things onto my tablet is a slightly slow process. What if there was a “second screen mode” that could be a combination of live-data and note taking? Something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://tomcritchlow.com/images/2024-02-09-11-13-02.png" alt=""></p>

<p><em>(I just faked this demo with a PDF but a live-calendar view imported from Google Calendar would be awesome - I’d like more room to scribble on my calendar pls)</em></p>

<p>Related to this idea - I’d also love a more formal diary / daily entry system. Kind of like Obsidian’s daily notes. Some kind of date-based notebook inside the Remarkable would be rad (even if it doesn’t sync with your actual calendar!). A daily journaling / diary / planning format would be great. (Yes, right now you can select a day-planner template, but you can’t then see them in a calendar view - the date isn’t a foundational element of the note).</p>

<p>Another thing I’d like - a quick-send feature. When you select an object on your tablet you can cut/copy/paste etc. I’d love one more quick-action to email it to yourself. Right now you have the option to send yourself a full page (as png or pdf etc) but often I have a single diagram/sketch that I want to send to myself - I don’t want the full page.</p>

<p>✍️✍️✍️</p>

<h2 id="giving-advice-is-hard-of-course">Giving Advice is Hard of Course</h2>

<p>As we know, <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2024/01/23/advice/">giving advice is tricky</a>. All these ideas are ignorant of the real challenges and focus areas that Remarkable is thinking about. Maybe Remarkable is gearing up to launch Remarkable 3? Maybe they’re trying to push into enterprise use cases? Maybe they’re trying partner with an ebook platform so you can buy and read books? I know at least that international seems to be a focus for them right now.</p>

<p>If I had to guess though, looking at the outside I think one of the core tensions for Remarkable is that they have their own software and they don’t run a stock android install. This is likely both a benefit (full control) and a curse because it makes things like ebooks, loading web pages, syncing with calendars etc much harder…</p>

<p>✍️✍️✍️</p>

<p>Anyway - if you’re a Remarkable user, what are your workflows and setups? I’d love to compare notes!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>The smell of fresh pine sawdust filled the air, with more floating up as I sanded the last rough corner of the stool. My toddler was happily sanding her own block off to the side.</p><p>Woodworking was a new hobby I'd picked up. My old ones, coding, reading, writing, had kept me stuck to my laptop, holed up by myself. Not very toddler friendly.</p><p>A surprise <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Decker-Junior-Workbench-Workshop-Realistic/dp/B0016DE80I?ref=zainrizvi.io">gift</a> laid the seeds of an idea. As a boy, the best summer days were when my dad and I would transform scratch wood into bird houses, planes, and eventually even rube goldberg devices. It was time to rekindle the flame.</p><p>A few youtube videos and a HomeDepot run later, it was time to pause my side coding projects and foray into a new world.</p><p>Except it wasn't that different from the old one! </p><p>Woodworking felt strangely familiar. Even its dopamine hits triggered the same spots that programming would.</p><p>Turns out, the best parts of woodworking aren't actually that different from software engineering:</p><p>The best software engineering moments are when you building your own tools. That's work with purpose.</p><p>Woodworkers do it too. They call such tools "jigs". &nbsp;Some jigs might be built to meet niche needs (like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1tqN65yRaQ&amp;ref=zainrizvi.io">drilling straight holes</a>). Others, just to save money.</p><p>As always, you have to decide what's the value of your engineering time.</p><p>There are mind boggling varieties of woodworking tools out there, each optimized for a slightly different situation. Want to saw wood with the grain? Against the grain? Need a quick but ugly cut? Need a smooth cut and don't mind it taking longer? What about curved cuts? And that's just for saws! </p><p>Each one is optimized for a specific use case, but unless you have an infinite budget you'll need to decide which ones are actually required for what you want to do.</p><p>Anyone who's had to choose a storage layer on AWS knows what it's like to understand your tools, figure out what they're best for, and which one most closely matches your needs.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2021/02/0_V5AvyPtgGhHLXZF2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="880" height="668" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/0_V5AvyPtgGhHLXZF2.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2021/02/0_V5AvyPtgGhHLXZF2.png 880w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="3-finite-non-monetary-budget">3. Finite (non-monetary) Budget</h2><p>Money isn't the only thing you budget. </p><p>Any limited resource needs to carefully doled out. With software, the budgets might cover hardware constraints (CPU/memory), networking bandwidth, latency targets, engineering man-hours, etc.</p><p>Turns out, there's one inflexible budget with woodworking: Physical space!</p><p>There's only so much room in my garage (even after I cleaned it). Whatever tools I get have to fit in there along with my work bench. I have to be really picky about what I spend my storage budget on, and some beloved items, like a razor sharp table saw, are simply not possible.</p><h2 id="4-design-first-build-later">4. Design first, build later</h2><p>In both worlds, sketching out your designs before building pays huge dividends. You get a clearer picture of what you'll make and you figure out how the different parts will interact.</p><p>Otherwise, you might have to throw away days worth of work because you took a slightly wrong turn.</p><h2 id="5-waiting">5. Waiting<br></h2><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2021/02/compiling.png" alt="Compiling" loading="lazy" width="413" height="360"></figure><p>Except with woodworking, you yell "The glue's drying!"</p><p>On the plus side, it lets you work on multiple projects at once.</p><h2 id="6-you-have-users-">6. You have Users!</h2><p>Once my wife learned of my plans, the requests for custom pieces started rolling in. &nbsp;Knowing that whatever I build has an eager recipient awaiting it is rocket fuel for motivation.</p><p>And since it's my wife asking for it, it's easier to justify buying the tools I "need".</p><h2 id="one-big-difference">One big difference</h2><p>With woodworking you actually get to hold your creations.</p><h2 id="intrigued">Intrigued?</h2><p>Woodworking has the same highs as software engineering (and even more if you spend enough time around glue).</p><p>You get the same fast feedback loops, close interaction with your users, while avoiding some of the more tedious aspects of software engineering. Plus you're never on-call.</p><p>I can see why <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/2mu7i4/how_many_of_you_guys_have_quit_your_day_job_to/cm7pppq?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">these</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24541964&amp;ref=zainrizvi.io">guys</a> gave up software. </p><p>That's not my path though, programming is too near to my heart and my day job lets me do more than <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer/">just write code</a>.</p><p>But it does help answer a question I've asked myself a lot:</p><p><em>What would I do if I was born a hundred years ago, before computers were invented?</em></p><p>And the answer is now clear:</p><p>Find something to build.</p><p><em>I write a &nbsp;<a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/newsletter/">newsletter</a> sharing insights on how to leverage lessons from across industries to become a better software engineer.

<p>For the first time ever, I was laid off, and had to find a new software developer job. I managed to find a new one, but it took longer than I thought, and it was a lot of work. I was in contact with 30 companies, got a no from 8 companies, no reply from 6 companies, and offers from 3 companies. Here is what I learnt from the process.</p>

<h2>Laid Off</h2>



<p>At the end of October last year, I lost my job. I was completely surprised, but in retrospect, maybe I shouldn’t have been that surprised. The times were getting tougher, and many companies had been laying off people during all of 2023. If the company is not making enough money, eventually there will be layoffs. In my case, we were 17 people let go that day, including 8 developers.</p>



<p>A few minutes after I had the Zoom call with the CEO, my access to all company resources was cut off. Apart from not being able to finish what I was working on (I had several unpushed changes), it becomes harder to say goodbye to everybody. Many of my colleagues reached out on LinkedIn, which was great. Some even set up Zoom calls so we could talk about what had happened, and say a proper goodbye, which I really appreciated.</p>



<p>Being let go was a new experience for me. The closest I have been in the past is during the dot com bust, when the project I was working on at Ericsson was cut. They were not yet laying people off (that came a bit later), so we were offered other roles within Ericsson. But I decided to change to another company instead (they reached out directly to me, since I had worked with of them at Ericsson). All the other times I have changed jobs, it’s been on my own initiative, while still being employed. I typically stayed on for three months (the standard notice period in Sweden), finishing up what I was working on, before starting at the new company.</p>



<p>The upside of being cut off immediately is that I could immediately spend all of my time looking for a new job, while still getting paid for some time. Even though I was surprised that I was let go, I didn’t panic. <a href="https://henrikwarne.com/2017/03/12/programmer-career-planning/">My philosophy</a> has always been that I should be prepared to find a new job at any time, since you never know what will happen. So I keep a list of companies that I would like to work at. I also stay friendly with recruiters that contact me, in case I need to get back to them.</p>



<h2>Finding Roles</h2>



<p>I started looking for another job immediately. The best source for this was LinkedIn, but I found some jobs through other means.</p>



<h3>LinkedIn</h3>



<p><strong>Open to work.</strong> The first thing I did was to change my LinkedIn “open to work” status to <em>“Immediately, I’m actively applying”</em> (from <em>“Flexible, I am casually looking”</em>, which I normally use). I kept the visibility to recruiters only, not all LinkedIn members (which would set the green <strong>#OpenToWork</strong> photo frame). I have seen arguments for and against using <strong>#OpenToWork</strong> – it lets more people know you are looking, versus it makes you look desperate. It is hard to know which is better, but I decided to only let recruiters know.</p>



<p>As soon as I changed this setting, I got contacted by maybe five recruiters per day for the first week or so. I suppose the LinkedIn algorithm alerts recruiters to people that have just changed their status. The quality of the roles was about the same as I normally get (albeit at a much higher rate) – some I really liked, some were OK, and some were definitely not for me.</p>



<p><strong>Applying to known companies.</strong> Next, I went through my list of companies I would like to work for, and looked to see if they had any open developer roles. I first looked on the company page on LinkedIn, then clicked on the Jobs tab. Many of the companies were actively recruiting. A good thing when you click on an ad is that you can see how many people have applied, and how old the ad is. Sometimes I would also go to the company home page and look at their career page. But I found it convenient to go through LinkedIn, where the format is the same, and you can see if any of your contacts work there. Sometimes you can also see who has posted the ad.</p>



<p><strong>Job ads.</strong> I also looked through job ads on LinkedIn. There is a search function, and I tried different searches, for example “Golang Stockholm”. It works well enough, and I would click on anything that looked interesting. LinkedIn also has a “Recommended for you”-section and “Jobs where you’d be a top applicant”-section (only if you have Premium), and I guess they use your skills and previous searches to populate these. These also showed a good selection of job ads.</p>



<p>There are however two problems. The first is that searching for fully remote jobs is unreliable. Sometimes it turns up good ads, but sometimes it turns up roles that are e.g. remote only in the UK. It would be good to be able to search for fully remote roles in Sweden, fully remote in EU, or fully remote worldwide.</p>



<p>The second problem is that it is not possible to get only the latest ads, for example ads that are less than a week old. So I ended up having to page through a lot of ads I had already seen. After I had found a new job, I saw a good solution for this in a tweet: use Google, set the time interval to last week, and search for e.g. <em>“golang fully remote site:linkedin.com/jobs”</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Reaching out.</strong> I also reached out to around 15 recruiters that had contacted me on LinkedIn in the past, but nothing came out of that. I knew that the roles they contacted me for would not be open, but I thought that they might be recruiting for something similar. On a few occasions I sent a direct message (InMail) to managers that were recruiting (some encouraged you to do this in their bios), but I don’t think I got a single response. Perhaps I was not a good enough fit, but it was still disappointing.</p>



<h3>Other Sources</h3>



<p>In Sweden there is a site that is matching developers with employers called <a href="https://demando.io/sv">Demando</a>. You fill out a profile, listing your skills, and giving a minimum salary you will accept. Companies advertise jobs there too, and you get a message if there is a match. I already had an inactive profile there that I activated, setting a relatively high minimum salary. I got contacted by one company there, which I later got an offer from. I also found a job ad there for a company I would like to work for. I did not find that ad on LinkedIn. I applied to them, and got an offer from them too. So pretty good payoff from using that site.</p>



<p>I also briefly looked at a site called <a href="https://remoteok.com/">RemoteOK</a>, but didn’t find anything that I applied to there. My general sense was that the quality of job ads there was much lower than on LinkedIn. I also had a look at <a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/">Efianancialcareers</a>, but there are almost no fully remote roles there (and they are hard to search for). On the first of every month, there is Hacker News thread called <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=pastMonth&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=Who%27s%20hiring&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;type=story">Who’s hiring</a>. I looked there briefly too, but I found it too hard to find something relevant there.</p>



<p>I later found another good way of finding companies to check to see if they have any open roles: google “competitor to” or “alternative to” and a company name, to find similar companies.</p>



<h3>Applying and Tracking</h3>



<p>All recruiters I was in contact with asked for my CV, even though it is mostly the same information that is already on my LinkedIn profile. It is almost as if it is a sign that you are serious. This is fine with me, since once I had an up-to-date CV, I just attached that one. When applying to companies directly, most companies ask for a CV (even when including your LinkedIn profile), and many also asked for a cover letter. I saved all the cover letters I wrote, and when I needed to write a new one, I copied the most similar previous one I had, and modified it to fit the new application.</p>



<p>Soon after I started to send out applications, I created an Excel sheet to keep track of my applications. I included company name, date the application was sent, recruiter or contact person, and a column for general notes. Looking at it now, it has 30 entries, but I didn’t send applications to all of them. In some cases, I added an entry after speaking to a recruiter, but then nothing came of it.</p>



<p>6 companies I applied to never responded at all. In some cases, the ad was more than a month old. But if the ad is no longer relevant, they should take it down instead of leaving it up and not responding. In some cases, I tried to contact the recruiter that had posted the ad, but I didn’t get a response that way either.</p>



<p>Ideally, all companies should respond. But I don’t mind too much if I don’t get a response if I haven’t been in contact with a person at the company. However, if I have had an interview with them, I think they should at least let you know if they are not interested. At one company, I had an initial interview with a recruiter at the company. She said she would set up an interview with a manager. Then crickets. I mailed her after two weeks, asking what was happening, but didn’t get a response. Two weeks later, I sent another mail saying I was no longer interested, and got an half-hearted apology back (but no reason for why she never got back to me). So this exchange now colors my view of that company. </p>



<h3>Tools I Paid For</h3>



<p>I have never had <strong>LinkedIn Premium</strong> before, but I decided this was a good time to try it, so I paid for a month. However, it was quite disappointing. Maybe I could see more profile viewers, I am not sure, but it is definitely not showing who all of them are. And even if it had been, it has limited value in a job search. I also got a number of InMails to send each month (maybe 5?). I sent a couple, but they were not very useful for me either. Then there was the “Jobs where you’d be a top applicant”, but that too wasn’t very useful for me. So I cancelled after one month. Before cancelling, I had the option of extending it for two months for the price of one.</p>



<p>I also paid for a GoLand license for two months (quite expensive), since I was looking for Go jobs and wanted to practice in an environment I am used to. I signed up for <strong>Github CoPilo</strong>t too, because I wanted to try it. It’s quite good, but I didn’t use it much, because I wanted to make sure I did all coding by myself at interviews. I already had a subscription to <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, and that came in very handy for many take-home assignments.</p>



<p>I signed up for <strong>Leetcode </strong>too, as I have done in the past when preparing for interviews. Mostly I like the paid version because you can get the editorial explanation for the solutions. I practiced a bit in Leetcode, so it was worth the expense. One company used an IQ test from Alva labs, so I paid for a practice course called <strong>Alva Logic Cram Course</strong> from 12minprep (there were lots of vendors, but this was relatively cheap). It was definitely worth it, I did much better on the test than I would have, had I not practiced beforehand. </p>



<h3>Reflections</h3>



<p>Times are definitely harder now compared to the previous decade. There were still many open positions to apply for, but it looked like there were many more applicants for each role than in the past. On LinkedIn, where you can see how many applicants there are, many job ads would have more than a hundred applicants. Further evidence of times being tougher is the number of companies that I never heard back from, even though I believe I would be great for the role.</p>



<p>There is also a big focus on having experience in a given language. In the past, I have started a job developing in Python without any Python experience. The same for Golang. It didn’t take me long to get productive in each language. Partly this is because many imperative languages are very similar. Of course, knowing the libraries and ecosystems is good, but in my experience not strictly necessary. But many recruiters now told me that it was a hard requirement from the hiring companies to have at least two or three years’ experience in the given language.</p>



<h2>The Interview Process</h2>



<p>For a typical job there were four or five interviews: an initial interview with a recruiter, an interview with a hiring manager, one or two technical interviews (either live coding, or going through a take-home assignment). There could also be an interview with a product manager, and/or one with a CTO or founder. All in all, quite a time commitment.</p>



<p>I was applying for both local and remote roles. For the remote ones, all interviews were naturally on Zoom/Meet/Teams. For local jobs in Stockholm, most companies wanted in-person interviews. This caused some problems, because it takes time to travel into the city. I could easily do many remote interviews in a day, but one in-person interview would take half a day with commuting. Mostly I managed to schedule in-person interviews on the same days, which helped. The advantage of the in-person interviews is that you get a better feel for the other person, and you can see what the office looks like.</p>



<h3>Preparations</h3>



<p>Since before, I had a Word document that I called <em>Interview Tips</em>. In it I wrote down things to think about before an interview, in a format that is easy to review quickly. One section I added now was <strong>Behavioral Questions</strong>. These are questions of the form <em>“Tell me about a time when you disagreed with a coworker. How did you resolve it?”</em>. Typically, you should answer them using the STAR framework: Situation, Task, Action, Result, Reflection. In the past, I have failed interviews because of these questions – I hadn’t prepared, and couldn’t come up with good examples on the spot in the interviews.</p>



<p>This time I went through a good list of such questions (<a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/leapai/">Rock the Behavioral Interview</a>) from Leetcode, and thought about examples to use. Once I had good examples, I wrote the question and my answer down in the document. Before an interview, I would review what I had written down, so I would be able to come up with good examples. This worked well, I didn’t fail any interviews because of behavioral questions.</p>



<p>In the document I also wrote down little snippets of code in both Python and Go. I tried to cover many common patterns and idioms. I did this so I could refresh my memory and quickly come up with the right syntax in a coding interview. I ran all the snippets first, to see that I hadn’t made any mistake, and included relevant output. Reviewing these snippets before an interview made me feel calmer and more prepared.</p>



<p>I also watched a good video by Gergely Orosz, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFOw_m5zNCs">Confessions from a Big Tech Hiring Manager: Tips for Software Engineering Interviews</a>, on technical interviews in general. Some takeaways: be curious and collaborative, and ask questions.</p>



<h3>Interviews</h3>



<p>In all my initial interviews, I was open with the fact that I had been let go from my previous job due to cut backs. I didn’t seem like disclosing this was to my disadvantage. I was never nervous talking to recruiters or managers – I always knew what to say, since I had done it many times, both in the past and for this round of interviews. It is easy for me to articulate what I am looking for in a job, and what my strengths are, because it is very clear in my mind. I was also not nervous before non-coding technical interviews, since I feel I know most technologies I have worked with quite well.</p>



<p>However, I was nervous when I had coding interviews. I don’t exactly know why, but my brain seems to work at only 50% capacity every time I have to do live coding. So, it can be hard for me to come up with a solution, or remember some syntax, when trying to solve a problem. Luckily, all live coding interviews went well this time, but probably mostly because I had prepared a lot.</p>



<p>Of all non-coding interviews, I failed only one (I failed several coding and take-home assignments though). For the one I failed, I was asked what timeout I would set on a database connection. I was more thinking about how long an individual user could be prepared to wait for a page to render, so blurted out too high of a number. This was enough to fail an interview that otherwise went pretty well.</p>



<h3>Coding Tests</h3>



<p>Compared to when I last interviewed a few years ago, there were more take-home assignments this time. Take-home assignments are a lot less stressful than live coding, but they also take much more time. Regardless of what the companies claim, I would say each assignment took at least six hours. There is an unfortunate asymmetry here: it is easy for a company to demand that you do a take-home assignment early on in the process, with almost no cost in effort to them. For the job-seeker, it is at least six hours of work that may or may not pay off. Even so, I noticed that each time I got going with an assignment, I <em>loved </em>the programming – being immersed in a task, structuring the code well, finding good names etc. It was extra obvious because I wasn’t programming as much as when I had a developer job.</p>



<p>I did five take-home assignments, two in Java, two in Python, and one in Go. I failed one and a half. For the Go assignment, I wrote a working solution, but did not include tests. This wasn’t stated as a requirement, but I should have included some even so (when developing the solution, I used a more interactive approach, which meant running the code a lot as I developed). That assignment was also failed because I did not include caching to speed it up (to me it was not clear that it would be run more than once though).</p>



<p>The other assignment, I failed because of hidden test cases and sloppy coding from me. The task was really good – I was given test cases, but no implementation. I implemented enough of the system to pass all the existing test cases. My instinct told me that I should add more test cases on my own (that’s what I would have done if this was on the job). However, I thought that I had already spent a lot of time on it, so I didn’t. When we went through my solution in the interview afterwards, they had run some extra (hidden) test cases on my solution, and discovered two errors in my code. Both had to do with cases with empty input. I felt really stupid for not being more careful implementing the solution. In the end, I still got an offer from that company, and that’s why I am counting it as only half a failure.</p>



<p>For the take-home assignments, it was quite helpful to have access to ChatGPT. Getting a working framework up for what I wanted to do was a lot quicker that way. </p>



<p>Of the live coding assignments, I passed three and failed two. In the first one I failed, I had to write a limited chess program, that only supported two kinds of pieces. It needed a project structure, a data model, valid movements for the pieces, and tests. I started from nothing, and had to be send the solution in within two hours. It was very tight and stressful. I got most of it working, but not all functionality. I also had a bug in the movement code. That combination made it a fail.</p>



<p>The other live coding was less well prepared from the company. I downloaded a repo from Github with some initial code. But there were no working tests, and it took a while to set up an environment to work in. I also had to ask many questions on how the logic was supposed to work (with 50% of my brain capacity), and in the end I took too long. For all live coding tests, I used the IDE on my computer, and shared the screen over Zoom.</p>



<h2>Salary</h2>



<p>A couple of times in the beginning, I gave too high of a salary number, resulting in cancelled interviews. So I changed my tactics to instead tell them what my salary had been each year for the past four years, to give them a sense of what I was ideally looking at (I had had quite good salaries). Often, they would say “well, we can’t pay that”. To this I would respond that since I currently don’t have a job, I don’t really have a minimum acceptable salary, it will depend on what they (and others) can offer. This would often mean that we could continue the process. Sometimes it also meant that I had a chance to show what I had to offer, which might later translate to a better offer than they initially intended.</p>



<p>Once I had my first offer, it became easier. Surprisingly often when I asked the companies what the salary range for the role was, I would get an answer. This was really good, because I could say no to the ones that offered less than I was prepared to accept. In one case, it didn’t check what salary they were prepared to pay. I only found out when I got an offer from them (after a lot of interviews and a take-home assignment). I did this because I really liked the company, but their offer was very low. In hindsight, I should have checked upfront, instead of wasting a lot of time and effort on them.</p>



<p>Even before this job-hunting round, I had quite a good sense of what salaries companies in Stockholm pay developers. It got even better after talking to many companies. In Sweden, you think in terms of the monthly salary. You also have to consider if pension contributions are included or not (in most cases they are included, and can be an additional 10 to 15 percent, which is implicitly included). A very average developer salary would be 55K – 65K SEK per month. Almost all companies are prepared to pay that. Getting a salary of 80K a month and over is more difficult, but definitely not impossible, even in a tight market. In addition to salary, many companies can offer options or equity, and/or a bonus.</p>



<p>In the end, you also have to weigh other aspects of the job. How interesting is the product and company? What language will you work in? What will you learn? Who will your colleagues be?</p>



<h2>Choosing</h2>



<p>One company I interviewed with was very positive, and ended up asking for two references, which I provided. But the next day, they announced that they would go with another candidate. I was quite surprised, since I thought I would get an offer from them. It’s ok if they find somebody else, but I was upset that they wasted the time of two of my references. The recruiter later apologized and said that she was convinced they wanted to give me an offer, but the manager had picked somebody else. I don’t know what to think, but it was quite a disappointment.</p>



<p>Even if you fail to get offers at most companies you apply to, you only need to have one where you are successful. In a sense it is a numbers game – go through enough processes so that you get at least one offer.</p>



<p>In the end, I had three and a half offers to choose from (I didn’t formally get an offer from one of the companies, mostly because I knew it would pay less than two of the offers I already had, so I am only counting it as a half). I managed to get them more or less at the same time. I tried to slow some companies down, and speed other ones up, by delaying interviews, or being able to have interviews as soon as possible.</p>



<p>I was lucky to have more than one offer, because then I was in a much better negotiating position. The top two offers were both very good, and I could see my self taking either. In the end I got everything I was looking for – a very interesting job, and a good salary.</p>



<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>



<p><strong>Stressful.</strong> Looking for a new job is a lot of work. It is hard to relax, even on weekends, because there is always some interview preparation you can do. It wasn’t until I had a firm job offer that I could enjoy my time off (I had a few weeks off before I started).</p>



<p><strong>Takes time.</strong> I thought it would be quicker to find a new job. But there are four or five interviews to schedule, and often a take-home assignment to do. You also want to read up on the company and product. Then the companies usually can’t schedule the interviews as fast as you would like. Add that you will fail interviews, and the process can easily take months.</p>



<p><strong>A numbers game.</strong> Even if you fail a lot of interviews, it only takes one company where you are successful for you to have a new job. So apply to many. I also realized that I am bad at judging if I did well or not. Almost every time I was rejected, I was surprised.</p>



<p><strong>People to discuss with.</strong> I have two former colleagues, Patrik and Peter, that I discussed my jobhunting process with. These discussions were really useful. There are so many aspects to consider, and having somebody who understands to talk to helps immensely!</p>



<p><strong>Responsive recruiters.</strong> Recruiters that consistently get back to you quickly are great! It is such a simple way to build confidence in the company they represent, yet so many recruiters really are bad at it.</p>



<p><strong>Reach out.</strong> If a colleague of yours is let go, reach out to them (through LinkedIn or other means) to say goodbye. It meant a lot to me, and I think most people would appreciate it.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I am lucky. I love programming, and I have a lot of experience. Even in a tougher market it was  comparatively easy for me. It still took a lot of work, but I ended up with a great new job as a senior developer at <a href="https://swissblock.net/">Swissblock</a>. I hope my jobhunting experience can be helpful to other developers looking for their next jobs.</p>

Articles and posts are easy to like when I already agree with their premise. But the depth of a proper book, from a real source of authority and not some random person online, looking at the problem from multiple points, that’s so much more insightful and useful.</p><p>So instead of hunting for best articles, I would 100% recommend getting Armstrong, or some textbook.

The thesis is that good standup comedians are the best public speakers, and that we can learn their techniques.  Much of what they do well has nothing to do with being funny.

I think when there's a power imbalance it's easy to ascribe every non-perfect action by people above you to be some act of self-interest, when in reality it isn't always true that everyone has a secret ulterior motive.<p>&gt; From the founders's perspective the org is basically an overactive genie. It will do what you say, but not what you mean. Want to increase sales in two quarters? No problem, sales increased. Oh, and we also subtly destroyed our customers's trust. Once the stakes are high, founders basically have to treat their org as an adversarial agent. You might think -- but a good founder will notice!

The other big ones were humility/thoughtfulness, honesty, and grace under pressure.  (Perhaps the original lecture addresses those, as well.)<p>I don't know the research on this (and would be hesitant to believe anything out of the business press about management).  I only have anecdata, intuition, and speculation.</p><p>I'm not perfect at any of these, but they seem to be a really good guide.</p><p>Note that not everyone has picked up the same influences in the past, so they might not have seen all of these, and they might've learned a lot of other ideas.</p><p>For examples of other influences (not just managers, but execs including startups): Many seem to prioritize projecting confidence, over everything else.  Others seem wired to persuade, to doing what they want or to having a positive impression of them, at all costs.  Others seem to think they must assert authority, first and foremost.</p><p>The difference in past experiences, and the reality of industry conventions in practice, means you sometimes have to explain something that seems obvious to you.</p><p>One time I failed to communicate well, I was characterizing to a startup CEO how I'd run a forthcoming engineering team, and I added something at the end, "and they'll be my people".  I intended it as shorthand for a style of conscientiously looking after their needs, and fostering a culture of loyalty to the team/project/company.  Of course that was ambiguous, especially in a business context, where aggressive self-interest is the most likely explanation for any behavior.  Later, I realized that he was looking to be the leader of more of a lifestyle company, with the entire company <i>his</i> people in a somewhat different sense (which was an influence he'd seen in his own career).  So I'd maybe sounded like I was saying I'd silo off a fiefdom of loyalists to me rather than to him or the company, shape part of the company in my image, or otherwise get between him and the people.

Everyone in a corporate structure is a servant.  How you advance is by demonstrating that you are helping solve the problems deemed important by your chain of command.  Theoretically this should be aligned from top to bottom; in practice competing priorities, communication overhead, and incompetence in the wrong places can greatly distort things.  This reality leads a lot of folks into learned helplessness, and social climbers gaming the chaos to gain power they are not equipped to handle.<p>The mentality "what's in it for me" is toxic and shows one is not ready for higher level management in a large org where cooperation is necessary to do anything interesting.  Better questions are "is my team working on the right thing?", "does my team have the right skills to deliver on that thing?", "what relationships do we need to succeed?", and last but definitely not least "is my manager competent enough to provide the support I need for my team to be successful?".  The last question is the key one: you won't grow if you are reporting to a muppet.

You're right that it's not inherently toxic to think of yourself.  The reason I reacted that way is because that mentality (whether explicit or not) is what leads to operating in a very transactional way or empire-building fashion that works against good outcomes in the long-term.<p>I honestly don't think being too selfless is an adequate explanation for career stagnation though.  Selfless behavior will generally help you get ahead in life and in your career, because good relationships matter a lot.  However you won't get promoted just because you help everyone.  What if you are just servicing the squeaky wheels rather than solving the biggest problem on your plate?  A good manager will only look to promote you because you have demonstrated you are capable of solving larger problems.  There are other things too: like the business actually has the need for a higher level role.  If that's the case, then your behavior is irrelevant—you just need to leave to someplace that <i>does</i> have the growth opportunity.</p><p>Overall the reason I said your comment was strange is because it clearly comes from some personal experience you had, but it lacks enough context to be actionable to anyone who reads it.  I can think of a dozen different ways I've seen a "servant leader" mentality succeed or fail, but it all depends very much on context.  Ultimately if you want to succeed you need to understand what game is being played and not fallback to abstract platitudes.

In a healthy engineering culture, a management goal should be enabling the maximum number of people to exercise their own leadership. Even the newfangled concept of "servant leadership" is premised on a separation of agency between those who "serve/lead" and those who "are served/led".<p>Effective management --- do not groan before I finish this sentence --- tends to look a lot more like adminship on Wikipedia than it does, like, war leadership. It's about picking up a mop and a bucket and making the way clear for people to do their best work. And, in our field, doing one's best work often means <i>making and communicating big decisions</i>, which is what leadership is.</p><p>There's also a distinction between the kind of leadership the whole company needs --- hard decisions about where to allocate resources and what bets to make --- and the day-to-day "leadership" involved in getting things done as a team. I term I hear a lot is "vibes based management", which is a recognition that somebody (probably not engineering management!) is making these kinds of decisions and communicating them just well enough for line engineers to make good choices.</p><p>If you're looking for management advice because you're running a whole company, that kind of leadership is in scope! But if you're looking to learn how to be a good engineering manager, I'm not sure how much "leadership" has to do with doing a good job.

Yes, an EM should be empowering as many IC leaders as possible, but that can't be done if the EM does not recognize true leadership.  While it's theoretically possible to succeed as a manager leveraging others without having your own true tech lead chops, the majority of managers like this end up either putting too much trust in the wrong ICs or (worse) devolve into cover-your-ass "agile" process bullshit.

          <p><time datetime="2024-02-10T00:00:00+00:00">February 10, 2024</time> · <span title="Estimated read time">1 minute read</span>
          </p>

          <p>Why <a href="https://stephango.com/obsidian">Obsidian</a> is 100% user-supported and not backed by VC investors:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We want to stay small, we don’t need to hire lots of people</li>
  <li>We follow strict principles that we do not want to compromise</li>
  <li>Our users are happy to support us, we don’t need VC money</li>
</ol>

<p>Obsidian will not exist forever, no app will. However, the <a href="https://stephango.com/file-over-app">files you create</a> in Obsidian are yours, and can hopefully last for generations. VCware is built with a five year horizon, it is not built to live on for decades.</p>

<p>Many startup founders raise VC money because they need the upfront capital to build their product, or they see it as a shortcut to growth. For some products the capital truly is necessary, but too often it’s fueled by impatience and the inertia of Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>In the short term, VCware tends to <a href="https://stephango.com/quality-software">subsidize pricing</a> to acquire users. It’s easier to grow if your product is cheap or free. But this generally comes at the cost of hoarding user data, and locking in customers. Once you’re in you can’t get out.</p>

<p>To keep raising money, VCware must paint an increasingly enormous vision of their future, which becomes impossible to live up to. This leads to increasingly disparate priorities that gradually make the product worse. What starts off as a useful app becomes burdened with crap.</p>

<p>Eventually all VCware must exit. That means being acquired or going public to pay back investors. It’s expected that 9 out 10 startups will fail. That’s just part of the math in a VC portfolio. The startups that have big exits pay for the ones that fail.</p>

<p>It is now possible for tiny teams to make principled software that millions of people use, unburdened by investors. Principled apps that put people in control of their data, their privacy, their wellbeing. These principles can be irrevocably built into the architecture of the app.</p>

<p>Principled people have always been able to make principled software. The difference is that now you need far less money and far fewer employees to reach far more customers. That wave is only just beginning.</p>

<p>If you have principles and enough patience, being 100% user-supported is by far the most fun way to build.</p>

	<div>
<p>This cube manages to balance itself on a corner, and can simultaneously rotate around its axis in a controlled manner. It does so using clever controls and a set of three reaction wheels.</p>



<p>The original idea for this device comes from researchers at ETH Zürich, who demonstrate their “Cubli” in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_6p-1J551Y" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_6p-1J551Y">this video</a>. Its design has been improved in some ways in later years. Notably, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWEWNBDW6CM" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWEWNBDW6CM">Bobrow et al</a> (University of São Paolo) introduce an improved controls concept, reducing the number of required IMUs (inertial measurement units) to just one instead of six.</p>



<p>I decided to pursue the challenge of building one myself. Even though the idea isn’t new, previous works are largely closed-source. I plan to change that. This means that I had to reverse-engineer and draw everything from scratch. The result of my work, which is completely open source (<a href="https://github.com/willem-pennings/balancing-cube">GitHub</a>), is shown in the video below.</p>

<p>You might think: <strong>ANOTHER USELESS MACHINE?!</strong> When I published my <a href="https://willempennings.nl/mms-and-skittles-sorting-machine/" data-type="post" data-id="95">M&amp;Ms sorting machine</a>, I received lots of similar remarks. Indeed, it has no practical value, but similar applications such as sorting of fruits, vegetables and nuts based on colour do. For this cube, the situation is similar: while this is mostly a great learning experience and research project, reaction wheels are often used in satellites (such as the James Webb telescope) for attitude control purposes.</p>

<h2>Mechanical design</h2>



<p>The mechanical design of this cube is mostly the same as that of the original Cubli, but it has some subtle differences. The main structure consists of eight “cornerstones” and six face plates. Three of these face plates have additional features to support a motor and reaction wheel assembly. All parts were drawn in (con)Fusion 360. My student days are over, so I had to say farewell to Siemens NX. The latter isn’t used much (if at all?) in the DIY community anyway, so I can share my designs with others more easily now.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="680" height="768" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cad-assembly-mechanical.png" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cad-assembly-mechanical.png 680w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cad-assembly-mechanical-266x300.png 266w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px"></figure></div>


<p>Most structural parts are made of stainless steel for its excellent strength. The faceplates are made of aluminium to save weight. These don’t need to be made of steel since the assembled structure will be more than stiff enough when made of aluminium anyway.</p>



<p>All metal parts in this project have been manufactured by <a href="https://www.pcbway.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.pcbway.com/">PCBWay</a>. I’ve used their PCB prototyping service before and was interested in their CNC capabilities. Part of the cost for these parts was sponsored by PCBWay. The ordering process was straightforward and I like that a quote was automatically calculated directly after uploading the part and specifying the material type. I’m satisfied with the parts and their quality: a small production issue was quickly resolved and all parts fit together without issue. Pictures below: judge for yourself.</p>



<p>I had fun with the design of the motor and flywheel assembly. I was looking for a robust design – after all, the wheels can reach speeds up to 6000 rounds per minute – while also keeping it lightweight. Even though I’m a mechanical engineer by education, construction principles aren’t my main strength, but after all that’s the reason for projects like these: to learn! I finally came up with the following.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-8-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>The motor is connected to a stainless steel bridge using three countersunk screws. The bridge eventually connects to one of the aluminium faceplates.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-9-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>A small hub is mounted onto the shaft of the motor and secured using three set screws. This hub is critical: if the center hole is not perpendicular with respect to the flat triangular face, the wheel will not be aligned with the motor shaft, causing vibrations and wear.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-10-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>A reaction wheel is mounted onto the hub using three countersunk screws. This step requires a bit of trial and error to correct for imperfections in the hub and wheel, which may cause the misalignments I mentioned earlier. I resolve these by placing tiny pieces of paper between the horizontal contact surface of the hub and wheel and this provides satisfactory results. After all, these parts aren’t taken apart very often.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-11-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-11-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-11-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-11-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-11-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-11-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-11-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>A small radial ball bearing is inserted into one of the faceplates and secured using cyanoacrylate (“super”) glue. This ball bearing will support one end of the motor shaft. The other end of the shaft is also supported by a bearing within the motor itself.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-12-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-12-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-12-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-12-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-12-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-12-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-12-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>Finally, the motor shaft is inserted into the bearing and the bridge is connected to the faceplate using four bolts. This process is repeated two more times.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-14-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>This result in half a cube. The remaining faceplates don’t require any special assembly steps and can be directly assembled. Notice how one of the motors is oriented differently with respect to the bridge to which it attaches? That is done on purpose: it simplifies the cabling work later on.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-15-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-15-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-15-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-15-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-15-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-15-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-15-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>The result is a strong yet relatively lightweight structure. The aluminium faceplates are relatively weak by themselves, but won’t budge when assembled together.</p>



<h2>Electromechanical design</h2>



<p>For the motor and motor controllers, other balancing cubes use Maxon motors from the “<a href="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/content/ec-flat-motors" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/content/ec-flat-motors">EC flat</a>” series. While it’s possible to find cheaper alternatives, the motors and their controllers are critical parts and I don’t want to skimp on them. The cube will balance by applying torques to the motors. Many DC motors do not even come with datasheets that specify the torque constant (which defines the relationship between torque and current), and many brushless motor controllers such as ESCs only offer speed control, but not current control. Both are essential in making this project a reality, so the choice for components of high quality is obvious here.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-2-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-2-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-2-768x511.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-2-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-2-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-2-1568x1043.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>I selected a 60 W <a href="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/product/591477" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/product/591477">motor</a> and a compatible 4-quadrant <a href="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/product/control/4-Q-Servokontroller/466023" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/product/control/4-Q-Servokontroller/466023">motor controller</a> which can deliver currents up to 6 A. At 24 V, this corresponds to almost 150 W. While this is well beyond the nominal power rating of the motor, it is no problem to briefly overload the motor. Moreover, the controller has a built-in I2t algorithm which limits current to the motor if the winding temperature is estimated to become too high. It is unlikely that the cube hits these limits in normal operation anyway, because currents are generally very low while balancing.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="940" height="499" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/escon.png" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/escon.png 940w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/escon-300x159.png 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/escon-768x408.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></figure></div>


<p>The software that comes with the Escon motor controllers is pretty great. There are motor commissioning and tuning tools and a nice dashboard showing the status of the motor and its inputs/outputs during operation (shown in the screenshot above).</p>



<p>For the battery, I chose a 6S1P lithium-polymer battery. The motors are rated for 24 V so a six-cell LiPo battery (nominal voltage 22.2 V) is a good fit here. The battery has a capacity of 1300 mAh (29 Wh) which is enough to run the cube for at least an hour, normally.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="649" height="624" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/motherboard-3d.png" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/motherboard-3d.png 649w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/motherboard-3d-300x288.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px"></figure></div>


<p>The motherboard is a custom design and integrates the three motor controllers, IMU (hidden), ESP32-S3 development board, and some supporting components such as protection circuits and voltage regulators. The board also anticipates adding mechanical brakes to the cube, by providing outputs for RC servo motors. Mechanical brakes will enable the cube to jump up to the balancing position by itself. I haven’t finished the development of the brake design yet.</p>

<p>Assembling the circuit board was fun. I started by applying solder paste and placing the surface-mount parts. After reflowing it in a small toaster oven (more details about how this works <a href="https://willempennings.nl/miniature-3456-led-cube/" data-type="post" data-id="48">here</a>), I soldered all the through hole parts by hand.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="708" src="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-25-1024x708.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-25-1024x708.jpg 1024w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-25-300x207.jpg 300w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-25-768x531.jpg 768w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-25-1536x1061.jpg 1536w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-25-1568x1083.jpg 1568w, https://willempennings.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cube-25.jpg 1673w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>Later, during integration and testing of the various components, I found that I had made a few small routing errors which I quickly corrected using bodge wires. It turns out that only one digital input on the motor controller supports PWM and I routed the PWM signal to another (unsupported) input.</p>



<p>I also designed a board to mount the battery onto. It’s much simpler: it has two XT60 connectors and two switches (wired in parallel because of currents up to 18 A) to turn the cube on and off.</p>



<h2>Controller design and tuning</h2>



<p>I didn’t actually design the controller the cube myself, but ported the <a href="https://github.com/fbobrow/cubli-firmware" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/fbobrow/cubli-firmware">work</a> by Fabio Bobrow from Arm Mbed to Arduino. I’m also using an ESP32 instead of an STM32 Nucleo. Nevertheless, rewriting the code was a good chunk of work. Also, since I’m using a different IMU (the ICM20948 by TDK Invensense), I had to rewrite the corresponding “driver”. I still spent quite some time studying the design of this controller and will spend a few words to highlight some nice things about it.</p>



<p>The design of the main attitude controller is most interesting. It is perhaps best explained as a negotation between two <em>contradictory </em>objectives. The first objective is to keep the cube in its desired orientation, that is, at its unstable equilibrium position. A second goal, however, is to keep the wheel velocities to a minimum. Not considering this second objective could lead to wheels speeds getting out of control, saturing the motors, and thereby effectively rendering it unable to exert torques on the cube.</p>



<p>The two objectives are in conflict: if the ‘desire’ to keep wheel velocities close to zero is too great, the cube simply falls over. Like mentioned before, if it is too weak, the wheels might literally spin out of control. The trick therefore is to find gains that result in good balancing performance and disturbance rejection while keeping wheel velocities somewhat low.</p>

<p>There is another elegant mechanism in the controller to deal with constant errors. What are constant errors? For example, there might be a small difference between the configured equilibrium position and the actual equilibrium due to imperfections in the weight distributions of the cube. In a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) controller, the integral part deals with these kinds of errors. This controller uses the <em>position</em> (in degrees) of the wheel as the integral! In my opinion, this is actually a very intuitive way of visualizing an integral controller. When I modify the weight distribution of the cube (in the video: by placing a tomato on it), you can see the reaction wheels increase and then decrease in speed: they are moving to a new <em>position </em>to compensate for the increased error!</p>



<p>Commissioning and tuning the controller was, by far, the largest piece of code-related work. Like any experienced controls engineer, I spent a few days flipping the signs of various signals before I got them right. Then, I had to find the right gains for the controller. The tuning methodology as described in Bobrow’s <a href="https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/3/3139/tde-20102022-084937/publico/FabioBobrowCorr22.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/3/3139/tde-20102022-084937/publico/FabioBobrowCorr22.pdf">dissertation</a> didn’t work for me, so I resorted to tuning the gains by hand. Note that my cube uses different wheels compared to Bobrow’s cube, so reusing the gains was not possible. Using an iterative procedure, I finally obtained the gains that result in the stabilizing performance as shown in the video (which is very good, in my humble opinion).</p>

<p>That’s it! A balancing cube. It’s the only fully open-source cube in the world which achieves a balancing performance similar to that of Cubli, as far as I know. I hope that others will now also be inspired to build this cool device.</p>



<p>Here are some links to similar cubes which are at least somewhat documented (more than just a video or photo):</p>

</ul>



<h2>Next steps: jumping up</h2>



<p>I plan to add mechanical brakes to the reaction wheels. These will enable the wheels to be braked rapidly, resulting in much larger torques than the motors can deliver. This enables jump-up manoeuvers which in turn enable the cube to get to its equilibrium position on its own. This feature is currently unique to the original Cubli, as far as I know. I don’t particularly like the braking mechanism that Cubli uses for various reasons, so I’m going to use a different approach. I’ll share results in a future post!</p>

<p>I think a lot about information and information consumption. The way the Internet made information readily available is phenomenal. Sadly, the signal-to-noise ratio here is pretty low. For me, consuming RSS feeds<a href="#1">[1]</a> offers the best way to read the kind of high-quality information that I want with very little noise.</p>
<h2 id="what-rss-is-and-how-it-works" tabindex="-1">What RSS is and how it works <a href="#what-rss-is-and-how-it-works">#</a></h2>
<p>RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication. Any site that publishes content may choose to additionally publish an RSS feed file based on a specification (e.g., <a href="https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification">RSS</a> or <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287.txt">Atom syndication</a>). This feed will contains enough information to show its content elsewhere (that's the syndication part!). These specifications are really stable, with RSS last being updated in 2009 and Atom syndication last being updated in 2005.</p>
<p>Here's an example of what an RSS feed using the Atom spec looks like:</p>

<p>That's actually the feed for this blog, and you can <a href="https://www.pcloadletter.dev/feed/feed.xml">see the rest of it here</a> if you want.</p>
<p>Now that a website has a published feed, anyone can consume it. While a reader could theoretically parse your RSS feed themselves, it's much more likely they're using an RSS feed aggregator (e.g., Feedly, NewsBlur, Inoreader) to subscribe to, and consume, multiple RSS feeds at once.</p>
<p>In the end, user interaction with your content looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pcloadletter.dev/img/rss-diagram.png" alt="rss block diagram"></p>
<p>While all RSS aggregators can act differently, they generally poll feeds based on update frequency and content popularity and cache the results.</p>
<p>If you're a content publisher, it's usually pretty simple to get RSS set up on your website. There are surely some RSS plugins for popular authoring platforms like Wordpress. For this site, I use the 11ty static site generator and it also has an RSS feed generation plugin.</p>
<p>If you need to generate your own feed, there are plenty of open source options. For example, <a href="https://github.com/lkiesow/python-feedgen">python-feedgen</a> will let you get up and running with a feed in just a few lines:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span>from</span> feedgen<span>.</span>feed <span>import</span> FeedGenerator
fg <span>=</span> FeedGenerator<span>(</span><span>)</span>
fg<span>.</span><span>id</span><span>(</span><span>'https://pcloadletter.dev'</span><span>)</span>

<h2 id="why-this-model-is-really-good-for-consuming-high-quality-content" tabindex="-1">Why this model is really good for consuming high-quality content <a href="#why-this-model-is-really-good-for-consuming-high-quality-content">#</a></h2>
<p>There are some attributes of RSS that make it innately good for consuming high-quality content.</p>
<p>The biggest pro of RSS is choice: I decide what blogs or sites to include in my RSS aggreator feed. There is no algorithm engineered to milk the maximum amount of interaction out of me. If I start disliking what an author is publishing, I simple unsubscribe from their feed. I am in total control of the content I consume.</p>
<p>Another selling point, for me, is that RSS feeds bias towards long-term content. This is usually content published to some person or organization's blog and the author has put in a good amount of time and effort into the post. They've had time to think, "Should I really write this on the Internet?" (a thought pattern I've found is sorely missing from social media).</p>
<p>Along the same lines, RSS reduces low-value content. It tends to greatly reduce the amount of content that exists sole for the sake of advertising. Often, when you're googling something and find a promising site, you'll visit it and be dismayed that the content is exceedingly shallow but there are plenty of ads to be found on the site. This doesn't really happen on RSS feeds because a lot of ads (especially the obnoxious ones) won't render in RSS feed aggregators.</p>
<p>There are no flame wars and no internet points on RSS. Social media has its value, but I really can't stand the flame wars, trolling, and people generally performing for Internet points. If there's an author I like, I just want to read what they wrote without having to wade through a sea of contrarian comments.</p>
<p>One final reason I really like RSS is that it's just-in-time: I can get to my content when I need it. I totally understand it's convenient for some to receive an email in their inbox with a website's latest article, but I don't love it. I'm almost never ready to ready the article when it hits my inbox, so now I have to decide what to do with the email. For me, it's a much better workflow to just browse to Feedly when I have the time and read.</p>

<p>RSS isn't without its detractors, but I think a lot of arguments against it are unfair.</p>
<p>One criticism is that publishers don't get analytics on who is reading their content. I don't think everything needs analytics. I also think analytics are closely related to one of the bigger content-corrupting forces on the Internet: ads.</p>
<p>RSS makes it hard to advertise and therefore publishers looking to make ad revenue off their content may be unwilling to use it. I don't think it's entirely wrong to want to monetize content, but I do see it as a big motivator for a lot of the bad content out there. When you make it hard to monetize, you reduce the number of "get rich quick" schemes involved.</p>
<p>Another criticism is that RSS isn't social and doesn't innately enable interaction. You know what else isn't social or interactive? Books. But they're still great. Sometimes you just want to read something without telling the world your opinion on it, or without some random stranger telling you why your opinion is wrong.</p>
<p>There's a class of criticisms about RSS due to fact that you effectively need to poll an RSS feed to get updates to it, so you don't get near real-time updates. Furthermore, some of the criticisms involve the fact that you could end up getting a lot of traffic to your RSS feed.</p>
<p>On the former point, I think it's a good thing that you don't get near real-time updates on RSS feeds. I mentioned before that social media has value: I think more real-time content is one of those. There was a time when Twitter was the go-to place to find out what was going on with developing situations. That's not the purpose of RSS feeds. If anything, the fact that we really can't get real-time updates from RSS helps keep the content focuses towards deliberate works.</p>
<p>With respect to traffic: I can't imagine this is actually a problem. If you're a large site maybe you have a number of aggregators hitting your RSS feed endpoint every couple minutes. That's not really that much, and is probably small in comparison to traffic to your actual website.</p>
<p>One final unfair criticism of RSS is that it's dying or dead. Every so often I see a post or <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/rss-readers-feedly-inoreader-old-reader/">article</a> asserting that RSS is dead or dying. It's true RSS isn't as prevalent as it used to be, probably because it's hard to monetize as a publisher, but that's fine. It doesn't need to be <em>wildly</em> popular for it to be great. Why does everything need a billion upvotes and maximum popularity to be worthy? I think we should enjoy RSS for filling a somewhat niche use case really well.</p>
<h2 id="fair-criticisms" tabindex="-1">Fair criticisms <a href="#fair-criticisms">#</a></h2>
<p>There are definitely some fair criticisms of RSS.</p>
<p>First, aggregators don't render content perfectly. It does for the type of content I write, but if you publish content with interesting visuals (e.g., svg animation, canvas, page scroll interaction) I don't think any RSS aggregator will display it correctly. This means there's potentially a whole class of interesting content that's not RSS-friendly. One approach here is to use RSS as a "preview" of sorts and then visit the actual content if you're interested in the associated visuals.</p>
<p>Another fair criticism is lack of discoverability. No matter how great RSS is for reading blogs I know about, it has no inherent capability to discover content that you don't know about. Some feed aggregators may have this kind of functionality as an add-on, but it's simply something that's not possible with how underlying RSS technology works.</p>
<p>Given that you just publish your feed and allow aggregators to interpret that feed, you also give up a bit of control about the publishing process. For example, there is really no way to tell aggregators that you changed an article's path. I did this a couple times on this blog, and you can <a href="https://feedly.com/i/subscription/feed%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcloadletter.dev%2Ffeed%2Ffeed.xml">see the duplicates in Feedly here</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, and one of the biggest issues with RSS, is that it's not very intuitive to non-tech savvy individuals. If someone non-technical clicks the RSS link on the bottom of my website, their eyes might glaze over at the sight of a bunch of XML. Their best chance of subscribing to my RSS feed may be to go to an aggregator and use the search feature in its UI to find this blog.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts" tabindex="-1">Final thoughts <a href="#final-thoughts">#</a></h2>
<p>As long as you're using RSS for its purpose (consuming content) and not trying to use it for something it's not designed for (social media, content discovery), it's still a really solid technology. If you've ditched RSS in favor of social media in the past decades, consider adding RSS back into your life!</p>

   [1] Note: I'm lazily using the term RSS to refer to all syndication feeds. This site uses Atom, for example. Kind of like how we use Kleenex to refer to any kind of facial tissue.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lambert here: Sleep that knits up the raveled sleave of care… See NC on sleep <a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/09/six-tips-for-a-good-nights-sleep.html">here</a>, <a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/10/thresholds-of-perception-do-i-wake-or-sleep.html">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2016/09/sleepers-wake.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Joan Costa-i-Font, Professor of Health Economics at London School Of Economics And Political Science, Sarah Fleche, Researcher, Centre for Economic Performance at London School Of Economics And Political Science, and Ricardo Pagan, Professor of Economics at University Of Malaga. <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/sleeping-our-way-being-productive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Originally published at VoxEU</a>.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Sleep is key to our physical and mental health. It also affects people’s employment and productivity. This column explores how the amount of weekly sleep influences employment, productivity, and the income of individuals in Germany. Each additional hour of sleep per week increases the probability of employment by 1.6 percentage points and weekly earnings by 3.4%. Sleep is partly the product of both public and private decisions, and can be incentivised so that the negative economic effects of not sleeping enough are more salient to individuals.</em></p>
<p>People are not robots; we need sleep to recover energy. Sleeping is the activity that people spend most time on in a normal week. Lack of sleep contributes to the desynchronisation of circadian rhythms and weakens the immune system and cognitive activity in addition to physical and mental health (Nagai et al. 2010). Lack of sleep is associated with unhealthy behaviours related to a modern lifestyle, the presence of psychosocial stress, an unbalanced diet, and limited physical activity.</p>
<p>Although sleeping enough is essential for optimal physical and psychological wellbeing, we do not always get enough sleep to feel rested. An individual’s quality of sleep is not completely under an individual’s control. It is a reflection of our worries and experiences in our professional and personal lives, including exposure to digital temptations, commuting time, financial worries, and work stress; sugary diets and mental health can also influence sleep.</p>
<p>Lack of sleep is so widespread that when people are asked what they would do with an unexpected weekly time windfall, the most common response is to sleep more (National Sleep Foundation 2020). Luckily, sleep patterns differ between weekdays and weekends, as unstructured time allows us to meet our sleep needs. Some of us sleep more on weekends, while others take daytime naps to compensate for this chronic lack of sleep. All of this explains the increase in sleep time dispersion over recent decades in the US (Hamermesh and Pfann 2022).</p>
<p>However, sleep is not factored in classic textbook microeconomic models, which typically refer to the trade-off between allocating time to leisure or work. Sleeping time is assumed to be constant. But today, we know that sleep is important as another time constraint in making time allocations, and it exerts effects on our physical and mental health.</p>
<p><strong>Social and Economic Drivers of Sleep</strong></p>
<p>Sleep quality is affected by changes in exposure to light, noise or the use of communication technologies (mobile devices), and access to the Internet or television. For example, the intensity of light in homes has an environmental influence on sleep quality, since natural melatonin is influenced by light exposure. Likewise, the time spent using technologies can compete with the time individuals would spend sleeping without them, and ‘digital temptations’ not only reduce sleep time but increase exposure to blue light technologies just before going to sleep (Billari 2018). Finally, those of us who are parents will have experienced first-hand how the quality of sleep deteriorates when there are children in the home.</p>
<p>Any economist who has read Gary Becker’s theory of time allocation would surely point out the opportunity cost of sleep, that is, the utility loss in terms of leisure and work derived from allocating time to other activities. Higher pay and responsibility, or an intense night-time social life, can take their toll in terms of lack of sleep. For example, a classic estimate suggests that a 1-hour increase in work time is associated with a 13-minute reduction in sleep (Biddle and Hamermesh 1990).</p>
<p>Of course, the cost of sleep can vary over people’s life cycles and even across seasons and time zones. What we do know is that this opportunity cost of sleep is exogenously influenced by the economic cycle, and some studies estimate that sleep duration is countercyclical: you sleep better when economic activity slows down, and sleep duration decreases when economic activity recovers (Costa-Font 2022).</p>
<p><strong>Sleep and Productivity</strong></p>
<p>Sleep not only affects wellbeing through the direct utility derived from its consumption but also through the greater income and productivity from feeling rested, which affects work motivation and cognitive functions. One way to study the effect of exogenous changes on sleep is to use changes in time zone variation to sunset times.</p>
<p>One such study using cross-sectional time-use data from the US estimates that a one hour increase in weekly sleep time generates an increase in earnings by 1.1% in the short run and 5% in the long run (Gibson and Shrader 2018). These results are economically relevant: they suggest that an extra hour of sleep per week raises earnings by roughly half as much as an additional year of formal education. But the study does not account for the fact that sleep is different for each person. Accounting for individual differences would require data that accounts for individual fixed effects. Further, estimates might be different in European labour markets, which operate differently due to the greater presence of union negotiations and where hourly pay is less common.</p>
<p>In our study (Costa-Font et al. 2024), we draw on panel data from Germany to estimate – analogously to the American study – how the amount of weekly sleep influences employment, productivity, and income of individuals. As displayed in Figure 1, we exploit as a natural experiment evidence that suggests that, on average, one hour of sun exposure reduces sleep hours by between 5 and 7 minutes, depending on where an individual lives in Germany (Costa-Font et al. 2024). We estimate that each additional hour of sleep per week increases the probability of employment by 1.6 percentage points and weekly earnings by 3.4%.</p>

<p>These estimates are also comparable to those of another work with British data (Costa-Font and Fleche 2017), where we used the variations in child sleep interruptions over time as an instrument for changes in mothers’ (and fathers’) sleep duration, to estimate the effect of sleep on the economic performance of mothers (Costa-Font and Fleche 2020). We documented that increasing the average duration of a mother’s night’s sleep by half an hour increases her participation in the labour market by 2.5 percentage points, her working hours by 8.3%, and her family income by 3.1%, although their job satisfaction only increases very slightly. We observe that these effects depend on the influence of maternal sleep on selection into full-time versus part-time work. However, we found that increased work schedule flexibility among more experienced mothers partially mitigates the negative effects of sleep deprivation.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Effects and Incentives to Sleep</strong></p>
<p>Some research has quantified the overall effects of sleep on the economy. The monetary costs of sleep deprivation on the economy are estimated at 1.9–2.9% of GDP in the US, 1.4–1.8% in the UK, 1.0–1.6% in Germany, and 0.8–1.6% in Canada (Hafner et al. 2017).</p>
<p>Given the effect that sleep has on work outcomes and health, some organisations have considered designing incentives for sleep. For example, Aetna, a private health insurance company, offers $25 for every 20 nights that people sleep 7 hours or more, with a limit of $500 a year, which is monitored by electrical devices (Hallett 2016). This effect adds to other evidence suggesting that subsidising digital information devices to track sleep can incentivise the time allocated to sleep. In fact, evidence from a randomised control trial suggests that a subsidy to employees to purchase a wearable bracelet significantly improves sleep and exercise (Handel and Kolstad 2017).</p>
<p>However, one possible criticism of traditional economic approaches to sleep is that it is unclear to what extent individuals are aware of its effects on their economic activity, which limits the role of traditional economic incentives. This seems a fertile field to test behavioural incentives, since many of the decisions about sleep are automatic, forged by routines and not by conscious decisions, which opens the possibility of making multiple adjustments in the sleep decision-making architecture.</p>
<p><strong>What Are the Policy Implications?</strong></p>
<p>Public interventions can make these economic effects of lack of sleep more salient to individuals. For example, it is possible to redesign television programme schedules or work hours, as well as regulate work expectations about answering emails and access to screens at night in general. Another issue that we could revisit via policy interventions is the so-called ‘cultural or social reference points’.</p>
<p>Lack of sleep generates what we call internalities in behavioural economics. That is, it entails negative consequences on our future wellbeing (future selves). Since people are subject to ‘present bias’, we fall to the temptation of delaying bedtime for the immediate gains of watching our favourite television series or having interesting conversations, ignoring tomorrow’s losses in productivity and motivation. These behavioural biases point to the need for behavioural interventions (‘nudges’), as simple as an alarm when it’s time to go to sleep.</p>
