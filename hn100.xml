                                        Helldivers 2 has had one of the roughest weeks in gaming history after PlayStation announced that PC players would be required to log into PSN.

                    <li>
                                        Considering a lot of areas of the world don't actually have PSN right now, that effectively makes Helldivers 2 unplayable in certain countries.

                    <li>
                                        This has been recognised on Steam, with 177 countries now unable to purchase the game at all.

<p>            <a href="http://thegamer.com/tag/playstation/">PlayStation</a>'s controversial announcement that <a href="http://thegamer.com/tag/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a> players on PC would be required to sign in to a PSN account (which will make the game unplayable for some) has led to the game being delisted from <a href="http://thegamer.com/tag/steam/">Steam</a> in over 100 countries.
    </p>    
<p>            After spending most of 2024 so far as one of the most popular games of the year (<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/helldivers-2-already-playstations-best-selling-games-pc-release/">and even one of the best-selling games from PlayStation in recent memory</a>), Helldivers 2 seems set to take one of the biggest falls from grace in gaming history. Just a few days ago, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/helldivers-2-being-hit-with-negative-steam-reviews-due-to-psn-sign-in-requirement/">PlayStation announced that PC players on Steam would be required to log into PSN to be able to play the game</a>.

<p>            Sony backed this up by claiming it was for player protection, but the Helldivers 2 community wasn't having any of that and took to <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/helldivers-2-drops-to-mostly-negative-recent-steam-reviews-after-steam-pc-psn-sign-in-controversy/">orbital striking the Steam page with over 180,000 negative reviews over the past few days</a>. To top it all off, players have even <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/helldivers-2-steam-reportedly-allowing-refunds-past-the-two-hour-limit-pc-psn-sign-in-requirement-controversy/">reported successfully receiving refunds from Steam</a> despite having far more play time than the standard two-hour limit that is usually enforced.

                        Helldivers 2's Steam Situation Has Gone From Bad To Worse
               </h2>
    
    

<p>            As bad as things have been for Helldivers 2 on Steam over the past few days, there's always been a little optimism that PlayStation would realise how badly this has all gone and reverse it. Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but that certainly doesn't seem like it's happening any time soon since, <a href="https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/1787016207364657340" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as shared by the SteamDB Twitter page</a>, Helldivers 2 has now been removed from sale on Steam in over 100 countries.
    </p>    
<p>            Just over ten hours ago, <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/137730/history/?changeid=23416542" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Helldivers 2's SteamDB Page was updated to add restrictions on which countries would be able to purchase</a> the game on Steam. Through a very lengthy change log, we can see that a total of 177 countries are now unable to purchase Helldivers 2 on PC, including Bermuda, Ghana, Jamaica, and a whole bunch of others.
    </p>    

<div id="custom_block_9">

        
                    <p>            It's not clear if the update comes from Steam or PlayStation, but if it is the latter then it seems like Sony is doubling down on the sign-in requirement.
    </p>
        
        
    </div>
<p>            Going through the list is a little like doing the Countries of the World song from The Animaniacs but with a far more depressing tone. Arrowhead has already made it clear it doesn't agree with the requirement and wants to change it, but we'll have to wait and see how PlayStation responds to the controversy next week.

<ol dir="auto">
<li>Xmake is a cross-platform build utility based on the Lua scripting language.</li>
<li>Xmake is very lightweight and has no dependencies outside of the standard library.</li>
<li>Uses the <code>xmake.lua</code> file to maintain project builds with a simple and readable syntax.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Xmake can be used to directly build source code (like with Make or Ninja), or it can generate project source files like CMake or Meson. It also has a <em>built-in</em> package management system to help users integrate C/C++ dependencies.</p>

    <article>
  <p>
    In my earlier post <a href="https://yuanchuan.dev/time-uniform-for-css-animation">Time Uniform For CSS Animation</a>,
    I took a note about a way to do CSS animations with <em>time ticks</em> instead of <em>keyframes</em>.
    It was limited applicable because CSS lacked the ability of doing complex Math calculations.
  </p>
  <p>
    After years of wait, CSS now has enough Math functions supported,
    particularly <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mod">mod()</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/round">round()</a>,
    and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Functions#trigonometric_functions">trigonometric functions</a>.
    It's time to revisit the time-based way of animation, hope it'll be more useful this time.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may need to enable the <em>Experimental feature flags</em> to view demos in this page.
  </p>

  <h2>The basic idea</h2>

  <p>
    Using <em>time</em> for animation is very common in shader programs and various other places.
    CSS can not start a timer like JavaScript does,
    but nowadays it's possible to define a custom variable
    with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Properties_and_Values_API/guide">CSS Houdini API</a> to track <em>time</em> in milliseconds.
  </p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>@property</span> <span>--t</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>syntax</span><span>:</span> <span>"&lt;integer&gt;"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>initial-value</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>inherits</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>@keyframes</span> <span>tick</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>from</span> <span>{</span> <span>--t</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>to</span>   <span>{</span> <span>--t</span><span>:</span> <span>86400000</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>:root</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>animation</span><span>:</span> <span>tick</span> <span>86400000ms</span> <span>linear</span> <span>infinite</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
  <p>
    For each millisecond, the variable <code>--t</code> increments by <code>1</code>, which is <code>1000</code> in one second.
    There's a trick to show the variable with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/counter">counter()</a> function.
  </p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>::after</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>counter-reset</span><span>:</span> <span>t</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--t</span><span>);</span>
  <span>content</span><span>:</span> <span>counter</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

  

  <p>
    Other values which are based on <code>--t</code> will change along with it.
    That's how we get the <strong>animation</strong> effect.
  </p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>div</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* 1 turn per second */</span>
  <span>rotate</span><span>:</span> <span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--t</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>.001turn</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
  

  <h2>Controlling frame rate</h2>

  <p>
    Maintaining the update frequencey at 60 frames per second (FPS) is sufficient for a smooth animation.
    Browsers often have optimizations for rendering so there wouldn't be any problem if the frequencey is higher than 60 FPS.
    But one can manually control the frame rate using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timing-function#stepsn_jumpterm">step()</a>
    function if needed.
  </p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>/* ... */</span>

<span>:root</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>animation</span><span>:</span> <span>tick</span><span>;</span>
  <span>animation-duration</span><span>:</span> <span>86400000ms</span><span>;</span>
  <span>animation-iteration-count</span><span>:</span> <span>infinite</span><span>;</span>

  <span>/* 8 fps */</span>
  <span>animation-timing-function</span><span>:</span> <span>step</span><span>(</span><span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>86400000</span><span>/(</span><span>1000</span><span>/</span><span>8</span><span>)));</span>

  <span>/* 24 fps */</span>
  <span>animation-timing-function</span><span>:</span> <span>step</span><span>(</span><span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>86400000</span><span>/(</span><span>1000</span><span>/</span><span>24</span><span>)));</span>

  <span>/* 60 fps */</span>
  <span>animation-timing-function</span><span>:</span> <span>step</span><span>(</span><span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>86400000</span><span>/(</span><span>1000</span><span>/</span><span>60</span><span>)));</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

  

  <h2>Transform time</h2>

  <p>
    The value of <code>--t</code> grows constantly in one direction.
    It's all right for the <code>angle</code> value that is bigger than <code>360deg</code>,
    however, not all CSS properties treat their values as cyclical.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's say I want to animate a box from left to right,
    if the translate offset is associated to the <code>--t</code>
    it will increase constantly without stop.
  </p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>translate</span><span>:</span> <span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--t</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>.</span><span>001</span><span>px</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

  <h3>min()</h3>
  <p>
    One expected result is that when the offset reaches at a specific value, it stops immediately.
    This is how <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min">min()</a> function can be useful.
  </p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>translate</span><span>:</span> <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>270</span><span>px</span><span>,</span> <span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--t</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>.</span><span>5</span><span>px</span><span>));</span></code></pre></figure>

  

  <p>
    To precisely control the animation duration we can restrict the value of <code>--t</code> instead.
  </p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>/* 270px in 3s */</span>
<span>translate</span><span>:</span> <span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>min</span><span>(</span><span>3000</span><span>,</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--t</span><span>))</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>270</span><span>px</span> <span>/</span> <span>3000</span><span>));</span></code></pre></figure>

  

  <h3>mod()</h3>

  <p>
    After the box has moved to the right, another option is to restart the offset from beginning.
    Now we have <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mod">mod()</a> function to achieve this.
  </p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>translate</span><span>:</span> <span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>mod</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--t</span><span>)/</span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>270</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>1</span><span>px</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

  

  <h3>sin()</h3>

  <p>
    Or to make the movement back and forth.
  </p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>translate</span><span>:</span> <span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>sin</span><span>(</span><span>mod</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--t</span><span>)/</span><span>135</span><span>,</span> <span>270</span><span>))</span> <span>*</span> <span>135</span><span>px</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

  

  <h2>
    Custom easing function
  </h2>

  <p>
    We can create custom easing functions using Math functions and the <code>--t</code> variable,
    which might not be achievable with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function#cubic_b%C3%A9zier_easing_function">cubic-bezier()</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>ease-out-cubic</h3>

  <p>
    The initial step is to bound the value <code>--t</code> between <em>0</em> and <em>1</em>.
  </p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>/* from 0 to 1 in 1s */</span>
<span>--t01</span><span>:</span> <span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>min</span><span>(</span><span>1000</span><span>,</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--t</span><span>))</span> <span>/</span> <span>1000</span><span>);</span>

<span>/* 1 - pow(1 - t, 3) */</span>
<span>--ease-out-cubic</span><span>:</span> <span>calc</span><span>(</span>
  <span>1</span> <span>-</span> <span>pow</span><span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>-</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--t01</span><span>),</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>translate</span><span>:</span> <span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--ease-out-cubic</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>270</span><span>px</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

  

  <h3>ease-out-elastic</h3>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>/* from 0 to 1 in 1s */</span>
<span>--t01</span><span>:</span> <span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>min</span><span>(</span><span>1000</span><span>,</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--t</span><span>))</span> <span>/</span> <span>1000</span><span>);</span>

<span>/* pow(2, -10t) * sin((10t - .75) * 2/3 * PI) + 1 */</span>
<span>--ease-out-elastic</span><span>:</span> <span>calc</span><span>(</span>
  <span>pow</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>-10</span> <span>*</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--t01</span><span>))</span> <span>*</span>

<span>translate</span><span>:</span> <span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--ease-out-elastic</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>270</span><span>px</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

  

  <h2>Experiment with CSS Doodle</h2>

  <p>
    As the expressions get complex, <code>var()</code> and <code>calc()</code> tend to make
    the code less readable. So I've added the <code>@t</code> function for representing variable <code>--t</code>.
    The latest version of <a href="https://css-doodle.com/">css-doodle</a> also accepts simple Math expressions directly inside arguments.
  </p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>/* rotate: calc(mod(var(--t) / 1000, 10) * 5deg); */</span>
<span>rotate</span><span>:</span> <span>@t</span><span>(/</span><span>1000</span><span>,</span> <span>%</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>5deg</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

  <p>
    Code is short without writing <em>keyframes</em>.
  </p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>@grid</span><span>:</span> <span>20</span><span>x1</span> <span>/</span> <span>280</span><span>x</span> <span>60px</span><span>;</span>
<span>@gap</span><span>:</span> <span>1px</span><span>;</span>
<span>@size</span><span>:</span> <span>100%</span> <span>20%</span><span>;</span>
<span>background</span><span>:</span> <span>#000</span><span>;</span>
<span>margin</span><span>:</span> <span>auto</span><span>;</span>
<span>translate</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>px</span> <span>*</span> <span>sin</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>*</span><span>@t</span><span>(/</span><span>20</span><span>,</span> <span>+@</span><span>i</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>6</span><span>),</span> <span>%</span><span>360deg</span><span>)));</span></code></pre></figure>

  

  <p>
    And it's quick to experiment new parameters too.
  </p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>translate</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>px</span> <span>*</span> <span>sin</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>*</span><span>@t</span><span>(/</span><span>50</span><span>,</span> <span>*@</span><span>i</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>2</span><span>),</span> <span>%</span><span>360deg</span><span>)));</span></code></pre></figure>

  

  <h3>Function @T and @TS</h3>
  <p>
    In addition to the <code>@t</code> function,
    the uppercase function <code>@T</code> represents another <em>time ticks</em> from beginning of the day.
    Function <code>@TS</code> is a shorthand for <code>@t(/1000)</code>, which tracks <code>time</code> in second.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is a clock implemented in css-doodle. (<a href="https://codepen.io/yuanchuan/pen/RwOXrwM">CodePen link</a>)
  </p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>/* ... */</span>

<span>/* second */</span>
<span>rotate</span><span>:</span> <span>@TS</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>6</span><span>,</span> <span>%</span><span>360deg</span><span>);</span>

<span>/* minute */</span>
<span>rotate</span><span>:</span> <span>@TS</span><span>(/</span><span>60</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>6</span><span>,</span> <span>%</span><span>360deg</span><span>);</span>

<span>/* hour */</span>
<span>rotate</span><span>:</span> <span>@TS</span><span>(/</span><span>60</span><span>,</span> <span>/</span><span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>6</span><span>,</span> <span>%</span><span>360deg</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

  

  <h3>round()</h3>
  <p>
    How can we make a jumping motion for the second hand?
    Of course, the direct approach is to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/round">round()</a> function,
    where the third parameter specifies the rounding interval.
		In the context of a clock, each step equals <code>360 / 60 = 6deg</code>.
  </p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>rotate</span><span>:</span> <span>round</span><span>(</span><span>down</span><span>,</span> <span>@TS</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>6</span><span>,</span> <span>%</span><span>360deg</span><span>),</span> <span>6deg</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>
    I'm excited about this approach.
    Although using <em>keyframes</em> seems much straightforward,
    for a demo scene full of math calculations and input variables,
    using <em>time</em> as a variable is more likely to get diverse results.

<p>Near the end of the second day of closing arguments in the Google monopoly trial, US district judge Amit Mehta weighed whether sanctions were warranted over what the US Department of Justice described as Google's "routine, regular, and normal destruction" of evidence.</p>
<p>Google was accused of enacting a policy instructing employees to turn chat history off by default when discussing sensitive topics, including Google's revenue-sharing and mobile application distribution agreements. These agreements, the DOJ and state attorneys general argued, work to maintain Google's monopoly over search.</p>
<p>According to the DOJ, Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/02/us-says-google-routinely-destroyed-evidence-and-lied-about-use-of-auto-delete/">destroyed potentially hundreds of thousands of chat sessions</a> not just during their investigation but also during litigation. Google only stopped the practice after the DOJ discovered the policy. DOJ's attorney Kenneth Dintzer told Mehta Friday that the DOJ believed the court should "conclude that communicating with history off shows anti-competitive intent to hide information because they knew they were violating antitrust law."</p>
<p>Mehta at least agreed that "Google's document retention policy leaves a lot to be desired," expressing shock and surprise that a large company like Google would ever enact such a policy as best practice.</p>
<p>Google's attorney Colette Connor told Mehta that the DOJ should have been aware of Google's policy long before the DOJ challenged the conduct. Google had explicitly disclosed the policy to Texas' attorney general, who was involved in DOJ's antitrust suit over both Google's search and adtech businesses, Connor said.</p>
<p>Connor also argued that Google's conduct wasn't sanctionable because there is no evidence that any of the missing chats would've shed any new light on the case. Mehta challenged this somewhat, telling Connor, "We just want to know what we don't know. We don't know if there was a treasure trove of material that was destroyed."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>During rebuttal, Dintzer told Mehta that Google's decision to tell Texas about the policy but not the federal government did not satisfy their disclosure obligation under federal rules of civil procedure in the case. That <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_37">rule</a> says that "only upon finding that the party acted with the intent to deprive another party of the information’s use in the litigation may" the court "presume that the lost information was unfavorable to the party."</p>
<p>The DOJ has asked the court to make that ruling and issue four orders sanctioning Google. They want the court to order the "presumption that deleted chats were unfavorable," the "presumption that Google's proffered justification" for deleting chats "is pretextual" (concealing Google's true rationale), and the "presumption that Google intended" to delete chats to "maintain its monopoly." The government also wants a "prohibition on argument by Google that the absence of evidence is evidence of adverse inference," which would stop Google from arguing that the DOJ is just assuming the deleted chats are unfavorable to Google.</p>
<p>Mehta asked Connor if she would agree that, at "minimum," it was "negligent" of Google to leave it to employees to preserve chats on sensitive discussions, but Connor disagreed. She argued that "given the typical use of chat," Google's history-off policy was "reasonable."</p>
<p>Connor told Mehta that the DOJ must prove that Google intended to hide evidence for the court to order sanctions.</p>
<p>That intent could be demonstrated another way, Mehta suggested, recalling that "Google has been very deliberate in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/google-hid-evidence-by-training-workers-to-avoid-words-monopolists-use-doj-says/">advising employees about what to say and what not to say</a>" in discussions that could indicate monopolistic behaviors. That included telling employees, "Don't use the term markets," Mehta told Connor, asking if that kind of conduct could be interpreted as Google's intent to hide evidence.</p>
<p>But Connor disagreed again.</p>
<p>"No, we don't think you can use it as evidence," Connor said. "It's not relevant to the claims in this case."</p>
<p>But during rebuttal, Dintzer argued that there was evidence of its relevance. He said that testimony from Google employees showed that Google's chat policy "was uniformly used as a way of communicating without creating discoverable information" intentionally to hide the alleged antitrust violations.</p>

<div>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            We introduce <i>Sequoia</i>, a scalable, robust and hardware-aware speculative decoding framework that enables serving LLMs (70B, 33B...) with a reasonable latency on consumer GPUs without any approximation (using <b>16bit</b> precision and maintaining the original output distribution). Addressing the problems of robustness and scalability of previous works on speculative decoding, we show below that <i>Sequoia</i>, with a large speculation budget, can serve a <b>Llama2-70B</b> on a single <b>RTX-4090</b> with an average time between tokens (TBT) as low as <b>0.57s</b>, which is <b>8X</b> faster than
            a highly optimized offloading serving system, <b>9X</b> faster than DeepSpeed-Zero Offloading. On a single <b>2080Ti</b> GPU (only 11GB memory), <b>Vicuna-33B</b> can be served with a TBT of <b>0.87s</b>.

            <i>Sequoia</i> can speed up LLM inference for a variety of model sizes and types of hardware. We evaluate <i>Sequoia</i> with LLMs of various sizes (including

            The hardware platforms have different GPUs, CPU RAMs and CPU-GPU bandwidth. The evaluation results are listed above.
          </p>

Here we show a demo for Llama2-70B inference on a single RTX-4090 (with and without <i>Sequoia</i>. Video plays at 4X speed).

<!-- Why -->
<div>
        <h2>Why <i>Sequoia</i></h2>
        <p>
           Benefiting from two key advantages, <i>Sequoia</i> significantly accelerates LLM serving with offloading. Firstly, <i>Sequoia</i> is more <b>scalable</b> with a large speculation budget. For a given draft / target model pairs, <i>Sequoia</i> leverages a dynamic 
           programming algorithm to search for the optimal tree structure, which enables a much faster growth in terms of accepted tokens with a certain budget (i.e. the size of the speculation tree). Secondly, thanks to sampling without replacement algorithm, <i>Sequoia</i>
           is <b>robust</b> in terms of generating temperatures, compared to top-k sampling and sampling with replacement.
           Apart from offloading, <i>Sequoia</i> provides a hardware-aware solution to adjust the size and depth of speculation trees to adapt to different hardware platforms. <i>Sequoia</i> can also speed up LLM inference on data-center GPUs like A100 and L40, which is discussed in detail in our  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12374" target="_blank">paper</a>.

  <p><img src="https://infini-ai-lab.github.io/Sequoia-Page/static/images/rssmerge.jpg" alt="Robustness and Scalability" width="800" height="400"></p><p><b>Left (Scalability):</b> Handcrafted tree structures do not scale well with large speculation budget.<br><b>Right (Robustness):</b> The total acceptance rate of 5 speculation tokens. Sampling with replacement (SpecTr) fails when temperature is low and Top-k sampling fails with high temperature. <i>Sequoia</i>, leveraging sampling without replacement, attains the highest acceptance rate. 
  <br>
  </p><div>
  <p><br>Below we show two examples of tree structures in <i>Sequoia</i>. The left one has 64 nodes which is suitable for on-chip inference and the right one has 768 nodes, suitable for offloading settings.
  We append more budget to nodes in previous layers with a higher probability to get accepted.</p>

<!-- Discussion -->
<div>
        <h2>Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
        <p>
            Leveraging a large speculation budget, everyone can use RTX 4090 or other consumer (low-cost) GPU, e.g., AMD RX7900 with <i>Sequoia</i> to host very strong LLMs like 70B model without approximation, boosting the applications of AI generated content.
            In addition, we believe <i>Sequoia</i> will perform particularly well on future hardware, because it’s performance scales well with the compute/bandwidth ratio of the hardware, which has been increasing over time (e.g., V100, A100 and H100).
            Moreover, <i>Sequoia</i>, as a speculative decoding framework which mitigates the gap in the memory hierarchy, adapts to any draft/target pairs and any AI accelerators. We will stay tuned with hardware community.

<p dir="auto">This is a little tool for automated <a href="https://gist.github.com/badboy/6267743">integer hash function</a>
discovery. It generates billions of <a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/integer.html" rel="nofollow">integer hash functions</a> at
random from a selection of <a href="http://papa.bretmulvey.com/post/124027987928/hash-functions" rel="nofollow">nine reversible operations</a> (<a href="https://marc-b-reynolds.github.io/math/2017/10/13/IntegerBijections.html" rel="nofollow">also</a>).
The generated functions are JIT compiled and their avalanche behavior is
evaluated. The current best function is printed out in C syntax.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <em>avalanche score</em> is the number of output bits that remain "fixed"
on average when a single input bit is flipped. Lower scores are better.
Ideally the score is 0 — e.g. every output bit flips with a 50% chance
when a single input bit is flipped.</p>
<p dir="auto">Prospector can generate both 32-bit and 64-bit integer hash functions.
Check the usage (<code>-h</code>) for the full selection of options. Due to the JIT
compiler, only x86-64 is supported, though the functions it discovers
can, of course, be used anywhere.</p>

<p dir="auto">The <code>-E</code> mode evaluates the bias of a given hash function (<code>-p</code> or <code>-l</code>). By
default the prospector uses an estimate to quickly evaluate a function's bias,
but it's non-deterministic and there's a lot of noise in the result. To
exhaustively measure the exact bias, use the <code>-e</code> option.</p>
<p dir="auto">The function to be checked can be defined using <code>-p</code> and a pattern or
<code>-l</code> and a shared library containing a function named <code>hash()</code>. For
example, to measure the exact bias of the best hash function above:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ ./prospector -Eep xorr:16,mul:e2d0d4cb,xorr:15,mul:3c6ad939,xorr:15"><pre><code>$ ./prospector -Eep xorr:16,mul:e2d0d4cb,xorr:15,mul:3c6ad939,xorr:15
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Or drop the function in a C file named hash.c, and name the function
<code>hash()</code>. This lets you test hash functions that can't be represented
using the prospector's limited notion of hash functions.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ cc -O3 -shared -fPIC -l hash.so hash.c
$ ./prospector -Eel ./hash.so"><pre><code>$ cc -O3 -shared -fPIC -l hash.so hash.c
$ ./prospector -Eel ./hash.so
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">By default it treats its input as a 32-bit hash function. Use the <code>-8</code>
switch to test (by estimation) 64-bit functions. There is no exact,
exhaustive test for 64-bit hash functions since that would take far too
long.</p>

<p dir="auto">Technically <code>x = ~x</code> is covered by <code>x ^= constant</code>. However, <code>~x</code> is
uniquely special and particularly useful. The generator is very unlikely
to generate the one correct constant for the XOR operator that achieves
the same effect.</p>

<p dir="auto">Because the constraints are different for 16-bit hashes there's a separate
tool for generating these hashes: <code>hp16</code>. Unlike the 32-bit / 64-bit
prospector, this implementation is fully portable and will run on just
about any system. It's also capable of generating and evaluating 128KiB
s-boxes.</p>
<p dir="auto">Since 16-bit hashes are more likely to be needed on machines that, say,
lack fast multiplication instructions, certain operations can be omitted
during exploration (<code>-m</code>, <code>-r</code>).</p>

He grabbed the radio to warn the pilot, his older brother Dick Rutan. But Dick never heard the message.</p><p>Nine days and three minutes later, Dick, along with copilot Jeana Yeager, completed one of the greatest milestones in aviation history: the first round-the-world flight with no stops or refueling.</p><p>A decorated Vietnam War pilot, Dick Rutan died Friday evening at a hospital in Coeur d’Alene, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/idaho">Idaho</a>, with Burt and other loved ones by his side. He was 85. His friend Bill Whittle said he died on his own terms when he decided against enduring a second night on oxygen after suffering a severe lung infection. </p><p>“He played an airplane like someone plays a grand piano,” said Burt Rutan of his brother, who was often described as has having a velvet arm because of his smooth flying style.</p><p>Burt Rutan said he had always loved designing airplanes and became fascinated with the idea of a craft that could go clear around the world. His brother was equally passionate about flying. The project took six years. </p><p>There was plenty to worry Mr Rutan during testing of the light graphite plane, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/voyager">Voyager</a>. There were mechanical failures, any one of which would have been disastrous over a distant ocean. When fully laden, the plane couldn't handle turbulence. And then there was the question of how the pilots could endure such a long flight on so little sleep. But Mr Rutan said his brother had an optimism about him that made them all believe.</p><p>“Dick never doubted whether my design would actually make it around, with still some gas in the tank,” Mr Rutan said.</p><p>Voyager left from Edwards Air Force Base in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/california">California</a> just after 8am on 14 Dec 1986. Rutan said with all that fuel, the wings had only inches of clearance. Dick couldn't see when they started dragging on the runway. But at the moment Mr Rutan called on the radio, copilot Yeager gave a speed report, drowning out the message.</p><p>“And then, the velvet arm really came in,” Mr Rutan said. “And he very slowly brought the stick back and the wings bent way up, some 30 feet at the wingtips, and it lifted off very smoothly.”</p><p>They arrived back to a hero's welcome as thousands gathered to witness the landing. Both Rutan brothers and Yeager were each awarded a Presidential Citizens Medal by President <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ronald-reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, who described how a local official in Thailand at first “refused to believe some cockamamie story" about a plane flying around the world on a single tank of gas.</p><p>“We had the freedom to pursue a dream, and that’s important," Dick Rutan said at the ceremony. “And we should never forget, and those that guard our freedoms, that we should hang on to them very tenaciously and be very careful about some do-gooder that thinks that our safety is more important than our freedom. Because freedom is awful difficult to obtain, and it’s even more difficult to regain it once it’s lost.”</p><p>Richard Glenn Rutan was born in Loma Linda, California. He joined the US Air Force as a teenager and flew more than 300 combat missions during the Vietnam War. </p><p>He was part of an elite group that would loiter over enemy anti-aircraft positions for hours at a time. The missions had the call sign “Misty," and Dick was known as “Misty Four-Zero.” Among the many awards Dick received were the Silver Star and the Purple Heart.</p><p>He survived having to eject twice from planes, once when his F-100 Super Sabre was hit by enemy fire over Vietnam, and a second time when he was stationed in England and the same type of plane had a mechanical failure. He retired from the Air Force with the rank of lieutenant colonel and went on to work as a test pilot.</p><p>Mr Rutan said his brother was always having adventures, like the time he got stranded at the North Pole for a couple of days when the Russian biplane he was in landed and then sank through the ice.</p><p>Dick Rutan set another record in 2005 when he flew about 10m (16km) in a rocket-powered plane launched from the ground in Mojave, California. It was also the first time US mail had been carried by such a plane.</p><p>Greg Morris, the president of Scaled Composites, a company founded by Burt Rutan, said he first met Dick was when he was about seven and over the years always found him generous and welcoming.</p><p>“Bigger than life, in every sense of the word,” Mr Morris said, listing off Rutan's legacy in the Vietnam War, testing planes and on the Voyager flight. “Any one of those contributions would make a legend in aviation. All of them together, in one person, is just inconceivable.”</p><p>Whittle said Rutan had been courageous in his final hours at the hospital – sharp as a tack, calm and joking with them about what might come next after death. </p><p>“He’s the greatest pilot that’s ever lived,” Mr Whittle said. </p><p>Dick Rutan is survived by his wife of 25 years Kris Rutan; daughters Holly Hogan and Jill Hoffman; and grandchildren Jack, Sean, Noelle and Haley.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-166842">

<div>
<p>First light for the Vera Rubin Observatory (VRO) is quickly approaching and the telescope is reaching milestone after milestone. A few weeks ago, the observatory announced that its digital camera, the largest one ever made, <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/166483/the-worlds-largest-digital-camera-is-complete-it-will-go-into-the-vera-rubin-observatory/">is complete</a>. </p>
<p>Now the observatory has announced that its unique primary/tertiary mirror has its first reflective coating. </p>
<p>The Rubin’s massive digital camera has an important job and garners a lot of attention. But it’s powerless without the telescope’s innovative primary/tertiary mirror. Primary mirrors are always the most critical and time-consuming part of modern observatories. The VRO’s primary/tertiary mirror took seven years to make. </p>
<p>The mirror is called a primary/tertiary mirror because it comprises two optical surfaces with different curvatures. The primary mirror is 8.4 meters, while the tertiary mirror is 5 meters in diameter. The pair of surfaces are combined into one large structure. The unique design reduces the telescope’s engineering complexity without reducing its impressive light-gathering capability. It can be rotated quickly and also settles quickly.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="660" height="283" src="https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/M1M3_render_labels.jpg" alt="The VRO's unique primary/tertiary mirror is two mirrors in one. It's mounted on lightweight honeycomb material for strength.

It’s mounted on lightweight honeycomb material for strength. Image Credit: VRO</figcaption></figure>
<p>The outer surface forms the primary mirror. It captures light from space first, then that light reflects upwards to the 3.4-meter secondary mirror. After that, it’s reflected back down to the inner 5.0-meter surface that forms the tertiary mirror. Then, the light is sent to the camera.</p>
<p>The primary mirror’s size is critical because it determines how much light the telescope can collect. More light means astronomers can study very faint or distant objects. The VRO’s design allows the camera to capture a large area of sky the size of 7 full moons across in a single image.</p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/PxwWt2Pp8Lj5Rlszkx">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>Only meticulous engineering and construction can build a telescope like this. One of the stages is putting the reflective and protective coatings on the mirrors. The VRO announced that the primary/tertiary mirror has its first coating.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>“This was a very well-conducted project from every angle, thanks to a combination of careful planning and the technical skills of our excellent team.”</p><cite>Tomislav Vucina, Senior Coating Engineer, VRO</cite></blockquote></figure>
<p>The VRO has a special onsite coating chamber built just for this purpose. It’s a 128-ton chamber on the observatory’s maintenance floor. It uses a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputter_deposition">magnetron sputtering</a> to apply coatings. The chamber will be reused during the telescope’s lifetime whenever the mirror needs re-coating. </p>
<figure><p><span><iframe loading="lazy" width="525" height="296" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gg9UPS7ndRA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>
<p>The chamber can apply coatings of different reflective materials alone or in combinations. It took a lot of work to determine the perfect coating for reflectivity and durability. Researchers tested different coatings on a steel stand-in mirror. </p>
<p>The first layer was an adhesive layer of nickel-chromium. Next came an incredibly thin layer of silver weighing only 64 grams spread over the 8.4-meter mirror. On top of that, another nickel-chromium adhesive layer, then a protective layer of silicon nitride to shield the reflective layer. </p>
<p>The person in charge of these precision coatings is Tomislav Vucina, the Senior Coating Engineer. Vucina describes the coatings as a balancing act. “This outer layer needs to be thick enough that it’s not worn off by cleaning,” said Vucina, “but not so thick that it absorbs too many photons and prevents the mirror from meeting Rubin’s scientific requirements.”</p>

<p>Until these coatings were applied, the glass was just glass. Highly specialized glass, but glass nonetheless. Now that the glass has received its reflective silver coating, it’s truly a mirror. </p>
<p>The application process took only 4.5 hours, nothing compared to the 7 years required to build the primary/tertiary mirror. Vucina and his team subjected the mirror to a battery of tests: reflectivity, adhesion, pinhole, and cosmetic. According to Vucina, the application process was successful.</p>
<p>“This was a very well-conducted project from every angle,” said Vucina, “thanks to a combination of careful planning and the technical skills of our excellent team.”</p>
<p>It’s been a long road to completion for the VRO. But after a long wait, first light is rapidly approaching. Excitement and anticipation for the observatory’s unique and powerful scientific contribution is growing. Its main output is the decade-long <a href="https://kipac.stanford.edu/research/projects/vera-rubin-observatorys-legacy-survey-space-and-time">Legacy Survey of Space and Time</a>. </p>
<p>“We’re extremely excited that both mirrors are now coated and will be installed on the telescope very soon,” said Sandrine Thomas, Deputy Director for Rubin Construction. “The combined reflectivity of these mirrors will enable Rubin to detect very faint and far-away objects, leading to great science!”</p>

<p><mark>While most can and will consider German reunification a “success story”, the merger of the two German states also meant the loss of identity, purpose, and direction for many. There are plenty of articles, books and documentaries out there which deal with the subject of East German identity far better than I ever could – but I inadvertently came across some GDR Lab Beakers which sent me down an East German rabbit hole. I emerged a few days later with a box full of Superfest Gläser – a nearly unbreakable and forgotten glass from East Germany.</mark></p>

They usually have a small table near the back wall with discounted products and the odd junk that they are trying to sell off. Now this table greeted me with the smiling face of Erich Honecker.

<p><mark>Everybody’s got their hustle – so fair game if they manage to sell them off. After I left the shop my mind wandered and I began thinking about those beakers. What if they WERE special? Were they Pyrex? Did they even have Pyrex in the GDR? I’m no glass or lab expert, how would I know if they weren’t some amazing relic from the past? I began reading up a bit into the beakers, and it turns out I was right: at €10 a piece they were massively overpriced. </mark></p>

<p>A quick look at eBay will tell you that you can find an entire set of these glasses for the same price. What I also found out was that these beakers were made of Borosilicate glass (invented by German glassmaker&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Schott" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Otto Schott</strong></a>&nbsp;in the late 19th century in&nbsp;Jena) and are known to the English speaking world as Pyrex. The heat resistant glass was marketed from the 1920s onward as JENAer GLAS, and was a household name as it was produced both for industrial and home uses.</p>

<div><p>Having fallen down the rabbit hole of Jenaer Glass, I soon stumbled upon&nbsp;German term which I had not heard of before: Superfest.</p><p>What sounds like a German music festival, is actually the name of a genius east German glass invention, a glass which could last up to 15 times longer than normal glass. The origins of Superfest, literally SuperHard – were twofold. East Germany was always a frugal country with a mindset of not wasting the limited resources it had, and it was driven by technological advances. </p></div>

<p>While the <a href="https://digitalcosmonaut.com/national-emblem-german-democratic-republic/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">German Democratic Republic</a> might suffer from the stigma today that it was technologically backward (which was true for certain fields), it was a creative and adaptive country which produced world class products and technology that’s still in use today (many of today’s planetariums are still equipped by technology invented in the GDR).</p>



<p>East German pubs and restaurants suffered from a problem, which every pub and restaurant around the world had to deal with – their drinking glasses kept on breaking. This wasn’t a unique east German or socialist problem (in fact, east Germany inherited a long tradition of superb glass making skills after the war) – it was just a common occurrence of wear and tear. </p>



<p><mark>With the advancement in glass making technology, East Germany developed a doctrine (which actually applied to all industry fields) in which it sought to use its own resources rather than import them from the outside, secure and satiate the home market, improve the glass properties to prolong product life, save energy, materials and labor through the longer life of glass products, increase international reputation by developing new production processes, and make some hard currency through the sales of licenses and property rights. Who knew that glass making could sound so important to a national economy.  </mark></p>



<h2><span id="Ceverit_%E2%80%93_an_East_German_success"></span>Ceverit – an East German success<span></span></h2>



<p>The Zentralinstitut für anorganische Chemie (Central Institute for Inorganic Chemistry) in Adlershof, Berlin began its research into hardening glass, specifically through the Ion-exchange process in the late 1960s. Patents for hardening glass through this ion exchange process were granted to the VEB Kombinat Technisches Glas in Ilmenau. This research was then expanded on in 1973 in Bad Muskau by Dr. S.Schelinski, Dr. D. Patzig, K. Heinrich and B. Grueger. They set up small and the large scale testing facilities, which coincided with the delivery of a glass blowing / forming machine from Japan in 1975.  </p>

<p>Quick detour: Did you know that Bad Muskau is home to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann,_F%C3%BCrst_von_P%C3%BCckler-Muskau" target="_blank">Fürst-Pückler-Park Bad Muskau</a>, a UNESCO World Heritage site? The park was created by (or better for) Prince Hermann Ludwig Heinrich von Pückler-Muskau also more commonly known as Fürst Pückler. While many english speakers might be familiar with “Neopolitan Ice Cream” – it was actually invented by the Royal Prussian court cook Louis Ferdinand Jungius in 1839, and named after Fürst Pückler. To this day, the ice cream is known as Fürst Pückler Eis in Germany.  </p>



<p>By 1977, Dr. Patzig and his colleagues achieved their breakthrough. They developed and patented a chemical process that made thin-walled glasses (at least 5 times) less prone to breaking than conventional ones. The team built on the research from the Institute in Adlershof, and created a new commercially viable process to produce what was dubbed CV Glass (Chemically Hardened Glass).  </p>



<figure><p><span><iframe loading="lazy" width="930" height="524" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o_xABUPF0r4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>During the first stage, the glass would be produced like every other normal glass – with machines cooling the glass and sanding off the edges etc. After this process, the glasses would be loaded off into a specialized glass holding machine (a one-off custom construction) which would then shuffle the glasses off to be heated back up to a temperature of 420C. </p>



<p>The heated glasses would then be sprayed with a specialized potassium chloride solution that fused with the glass surface. This Potassium chloride solution filled in the micro ruptures within the glass that naturally occur during glass production, making the glass less prone to breaking. And that’s the whole process of “Ion Exchanging”. A unique feature of this hardened glass was that it bounced when you dropped it, essentially giving you a second chance to catch the glass.  </p>



<p> This newly created glass was then called “Ceverit”. Ce stood for Chemisch (Chemically), “ver” for verfestigt (hardened) and the “it” stood for the silica component. </p>



<h2><span id="Superfest_%E2%80%93_a_design_icon"></span>Superfest – a design icon<span></span></h2>



<p><mark>At the same time, the Generalkollektiv under Paul Bittner, Fritz Keuchel and Tilo Poitz set out to design a universally versatile glass. It needed to be as light as possible, take up as little space as possible and be as durable as could be.&nbsp;</mark></p>



<p><mark>By 1978, the Generalkollektiv came up with a glass that essentially ushered in a new standard of “catering” glass in the GDR. They had come up with a newly patented way to reduce the weight and increase the durability of the glass by introducing a special salt in the production process. The design and practicality of the glasses, especially their stackability (earning them the nickname stapelglas) was even recognized by the GDR, earning itself the “Good Design” award in 1980.&nbsp;</mark></p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digitalcosmonaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/gestapelt-ddr-glas-superfest-ceverit-bierglas-logo-ost-deutschland.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1" alt="gestapelt ddr glas superfest ceverit bierglas logo ost deutschland" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>


<p><mark>So, with the design and the chemical process in place, the Ministry for Glass and Ceramic Industries gave the order to expand the glass production plant in Schewpnitz with a new production hall. A total of one million marks was made available, and Ceverit glass production began in April 1980. <p>  An estimated 110 million glasses were produced in all shapes and sizes in the following 10 years, ranging from shot glasses to half liter beer glasses. Interestingly enough – the name Ceverit was phased out before production began and replaced with “Superfest (Super Hard), as someone noticed that “Ceverit” was a conjugated form of the Latin word “cevere”, which translates to “wiggling your butt while having sex”. Opportunity missed in my opinion.</p></mark></p>



<h2><span id="Capitalism_has_no_need_for_durability"></span>Capitalism has no need for durability<span></span></h2>



<p>Despite their commercial success in East Germany, the production plant in Schewpnitz was shut down on the 1st of July, 1990. After German reunification, the plant was sold off and scrapped piece by piece – as no manufacturer had any interest in the technology, or in a product which would actually “slow down” sales. And that’s (just one of many small) tragedies of German reunification. Superfest was an invention that maybe could have only been made under a “socialist” system – it was a product that solved a problem, but wasn’t dependent on inflated sales figure due planned obsolescence.</p>


<div>

<p><mark>While commercial manufactures might not be interested in producing a glass that’s more durable, pub owners and users of Superfest glasses swear on the product. Thankfully they were produced in such quantities that they can still be found for reasonable prices online and in flea markets. Grab them while you can – they won’t be available forever. </mark></p>



<p><mark><strong> Epilogue<br></strong> While the Superfest glass is by far more durable than normal glass, when they shatter – the burst into a million fine pieces and are a total nightmare to clean up. I’m not sure if it’s because of their potassium chloride coating or because they are made to be super thin, my advice is to not drop them.&nbsp;</mark></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Some sad news to report on the blog this week. I got word that long-time Industrial Designer at Atari coin-operated division, Mike Jang, has passed away.</p>



<p>I’ve known Mike since 2016, and whilst we never met, he was always on the other end of an email answering my questions and providing really valuable input into my articles here on the blog, and especially so for my book <em>Missile Commander</em>. Mike has always been approachable and happy to share his knowledge and deep insight into the industrial design processes at Atari.</p>



<p>Learning his craft at San Jose State University, Mike joined Atari’s Industrial Design team during the mid 70s and remained there through the eighties. This meant he was fortunate enough to witness the explosion of Atari’s fortunes right through the Golden Age of arcade videogaming. He was right there in the engine room of Atari contributing to the coin-op division’s game output. </p>



<p>As an Industrial Designer, his main role was to refine the ergonomics of arcade cabinets – he was a big advocate of making sure that the physical interface players used to interact with Atari’s game cabinets was just right; and if that meant bespoke controls, parts and mouldings were required, then he would push the company to make it happen. He brought his own artistic flair to his design work, creating some of the most iconic cabinets from the era.</p>

I believe that was an unreleased kiosk of some kind, intended for installation at MacDonald’s outlets across the USA. The project never came to fruition</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>It is very easy to take for granted some of Atari’s cabinet design choices, but all were deeply thought through by Mike and his team, extensively tested and then produced – mostly in-house – resulting in the most varied portfolio of arcade cabinets ever produced by one manufacturer. Atari were the industry leaders in this regard by a country mile. Mike’s work was extensive and he was responsible for many of Atari’s patents, made in his name.</p>



<p>This picture was taken in 1981. Mike is captured here discussing the design of Atari’s <em>Asteroids Deluxe</em> cabinet with colleague Dave Cook:</p>

<p>I documented in my book the extensive work that Mike put into the original design of the <em>Missile Command</em> prototype cabinet. He had this to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Arcade games were pre-CAD so we drew up the cabinet with drafting tables, pencil, and paper. Each piece of wood or plastic was drawn and sent to the engineering woodshop to be built. Metal parts went to another in house shop. Everything was done inside our building so as to keep the game secret from the competition.</p>

<p>Mike sketched out the initial ideas for <em>Missile Command</em>, based on US military nuclear consoles – keeping the vibe relevant to the game’s subject matter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first main goal is to build a game that is put out for testing. Usually only one was built since one never knew if it will make mega bucks or no bucks. If the first test goes good, we might build and test more. That was a sales and marketing call. If it tested good, there would be a big push to go into production as soon as possible. Reason being, unscrupulous companies would spot a game on test and start making their own illegal copies. It’s better to get the game out and sell as many as possible before the copiers showed up. That was more cost effective than going to court and sue.</p>

<p>When the original <em>Missile Command</em> cabinet came back from testing with negative feedback about the large marquee, he went back to his design sketch and made a pretty dramatic change:</p>

Notice the new red lines on this cabinet draft, outlining the proposed shape of the production version of Missile Command that we are familiar with today</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>As you can see, a key part of Mikes job, was to provide solutions to problems arising from creating arcade cabinets, testing hardware, either internally or out in the field, inevitably creates issues that will need fixing, requiring the industrial design team to go back to the drawing board to amend their initial creations. This would be a pretty thankless task as you can imagine, but Mike was happy to oblige most requests.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I didn’t interact with Mike Jang a great deal, but when I was doing temperature testing of the games and found the temperature inside was too high Mike didn’t have a problem putting in a vent, sometimes an extra vent, and sometimes a fan.</p>
<cite>Jed Margolin, Atari engineer and colleague</cite></blockquote>



<p>Here are some more cabinet designs that Mike was responsible for during his time at Atari:</p>

<p>I spoke to Mike about his work on the <em>Star Wars</em> cabinet, and he had this to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I started the concepts for the Star Wars cabinet and later another designer did more detailed work on the plastic part in front of the monitor. One of the main elements I sketched up were the hydraulic ram shapes on the plastic parts. Those rams were often seen in the movie, especially the ramp to the Millennium Falcon. Also I wanted to continue the mechanical theme by adding that truss style design to the sides of the roof. I was concerned because that was a particle board part that was cut with an angled router bit. Then the bare particle board was just painted black. I was worried about the wood texture appearance but nobody noticed after everything else was put in place.</p>

<p>Another two games that spring to mind are <em>Firefox</em>, where Mike was responsible for the control panel design, and <em>Hydra </em>which used one of Mike’s full cabinet sketches. </p>



<p>His full discography of arcade cabinet design is too extensive to cover here, but his work spanned almost two decades and was extremely varied as you can see. </p>



<p>Post Atari, Mike was big on Hot Rodding and took his design skills to mock up car designs. Here is his 1951 Mercury coupe that he acquired in 1989 and spent many hours meticulously customising. He still owned this car right up to his passing:</p>

<p>Arcadeblogger.com is a richer experience thanks to Mike’s input over the years, and my book would be a lesser tome were it not for Mike’s unique perspective and detail on the events leading up to, and after, the creation of the prototype <em>Missile Command</em> cabinet.</p>

<p>Although Mike is no longer with us, his design legacy does live on in some of the fantastic looking arcade hardware he created – have a look out for these machines next time you’re at an arcade, and raise a glass when you play.</p>



<p>One of the things that Mike did recently, was to donate all of his old Atari documents for archiving at Stanford University. The <em><a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/12357521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Jang collection of Atari materials, 1978-1991</a></em> can be accessed and viewed by researchers for years to come, which is great news.</p>



<p>Mike I’m sure will be deeply missed by his Atari colleagues, who speak very highly of him as a designer, but also a friend and person; and based on my interactions with him, I would absolutely echo those sentiments here and send condolences to his family and friends.</p>



<p>I hope in a small way, this tribute highlights some of Mike’s superb work.</p>



<p>See you next time.</p>

      resurrect the project</a> began by Rodrigo
    Arias Mallo.</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>A</span> cloak of silence has descended over the recent whistleblower lawsuit <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/myvmgloeovr/Hanna%20v%20ADA%20complaint%2011-15.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">claiming</a> that the American Diabetes Association, or ADA, accepted corporate money in return for recommending recipes that threatened the health of people with diabetes.</p><figure id="5390fdfd-4665-4d83-8f5d-ac34830da37a" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:1,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Study: ‘gamechanger’ diabetes drugs cost up to 400 times more than needed&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;5390fdfd-4665-4d83-8f5d-ac34830da37a&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/28/drug-companies-diabetes-drugs-medicines-ozempic-trulicity&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:10}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false,&quot;assetOrigin&quot;:&quot;https://assets.guim.co.uk/&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>Elizabeth Hanna, the ex-ADA chief nutritionist who alleged that her former employer fired her over her refusal to endorse Splenda-filled salads, has quietly settled her case. In a statement to the Guardian, Hanna’s attorney, Lauren Davis, said that “the matter has been resolved”. No details were provided either by Davis or by a spokesperson for the ADA, which declined to comment.</p><p>For Hanna, accepting a settlement from the ADA was no doubt a simpler and less stressful and risky alternative to a trial, but for me and the country’s other 38 million people with diabetes, it is a letdown. What a great opportunity a trial would have been to expose the inner workings of the ADA, the patient advocacy organization up to its eyeballs in big-business funding.</p><p>I recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/18/splenda-diabetes-lawsuit" data-link-name="in body link">wrote</a> about Hanna’s lawsuit as part of our series <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/death-by-diabetes--america-s-preventable-epidemic" data-link-name="in body link">Death by Diabetes: America’s Preventable Epidemic</a>. My view is that diabetes is an urgent national scandal. Over 100 million Americans have diabetes or prediabetes, and 100,000 die from the condition annually. In addition, every year hundreds of thousands of people with diabetes have limbs amputated or suffer blindness or kidney disease. Diabetes costs our country $400bn annually to treat.</p><p>And although type-2 diabetes is often reversible through a low-carbohydrate diet, the ADA and the pharmaceutical industry <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/17/ada-american-diabetes-association-big-pharma" data-link-name="in body link">don’t seem</a> very interested in acknowledging that. Instead, they promote a laundry list of corporate deals and pharmaceutical treatments that have failed to stem the disease’s lethal and expensive impact on American life.</p><p>Hanna’s complaint, filed last year in a New Jersey court, alleged a litany of wrongdoings by one of the country’s most powerful patient advocacy organizations. Hanna said that ADA higher-ups pressured her to approve recipes that included generous helpings of the artificial sweetener Splenda, despite research published in the ADA’s own scientific journal <a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/46/9/1681/153434/Artificial-Sweeteners-and-Risk-of-Type-2-Diabetes" data-link-name="in body link">finding</a> that artificial sweeteners may raise consumers’ risk of type-2 diabetes.</p><p>Hanna further alleged that the pressure was the result of a $1m contribution made to the ADA by Heartland Food Products Group. Finally, she said the ADA was a revolving door of nutrition directors, with seven leaders coming and going over the past four years – largely because, she asserted, her predecessors “were either terminated by the ADA when they refused to comply with the ADA’s unethical and unlawful practices or were constructively terminated by the ADA by the abusive and hostile work environment they faced for refusing to comply”.</p><p>The ADA rejects the allegations in the lawsuit. The Heartland Food Products Group, which was not named in the lawsuit, has also said that it rejects any allegations of wrongdoing, and indicated it would continue working with the ADA. “Heartland will continue to support the ADA and honorably provide recipes and educational information to help people successfully reduce sugar levels and live happier and healthier lives,” Heartland said in a statement.</p><p>By settling, the ADA manages to avoid the discovery process, and the potentially embarrassing revelations that might have come with it.</p><p>Hanna’s lawyers appear to have grasped the implications of her lawsuit, and originally suggested her quest could take on heroic dimensions. “Hanna’s story could be the next movie that Americans need to see to understand what is going on behind closed doors between major for-profit corporations and the not-for-profit health sector,” they wrote in their legal complaint.</p><p>Although she chose to settle with the ADA, in reality Hanna has already performed a giant public service. Her <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/myvmgloeovr/Hanna%20v%20ADA%20complaint%2011-15.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">legal complaint</a> is a public document open for the ADA’s board of directors, clinicians across the US and the world, and members of Congress to read. Her meticulous account depicts the world’s most important diabetes patient advocacy organization as a cynical fund-raising machine, anxious to please its corporate overlords at the expense of the millions of people with diabetes it is supposed to be trying to help.</p><p>“The defendant’s conduct shows that they were party to a scheme to defraud the American people by approving and endorsing recipes submitted by Splenda to be lauded by the ADA as a healthy choice for people with diabetes, when the ADA knew that those recipes were contrary to the ADA’s guidelines and well-established and emerging scientific principles,” the complaint reads.</p><p>In case you’re curious, the ADA and Splenda appear to be still at it. As I write this, the ADA’s Diabetes Food Hub web page still <a href="https://www.diabetesfoodhub.org/search-results.html?banners=5&amp;keywords=splenda&amp;per_page=32" data-link-name="in body link">features</a> no fewer than 203 recipes – some marked “sponsored”, some not – that include Splenda, whose parent company’s $1m contribution has brought to light the utter insanity of our diabetes epidemic.</p><p>Isn’t it long overdue for the ADA’s board to act?</p><ul>

<p dir="auto">Verus is a tool for verifying the correctness of code written in Rust.
Developers write specifications of what their code should do,
and Verus statically checks that the executable Rust code will always
satisfy the specifications for all possible executions of the code.
Rather than adding run-time checks, Verus instead relies on powerful solvers to
prove the code is correct.  Verus currently supports a subset of Rust (which we
are working to expand), and in some cases, it allows developers to go beyond
the standard Rust type system and statically check the correctness of code
that, for example, manipulates raw pointers.</p>

<p dir="auto">We use GitHub discussions for feature requests and more open-ended conversations about
upcoming features, and we reserve GitHub issues for actionable issues (bugs) with
existing features. Don't worry though: if we think an issue should be a discussion (or
vice versa) we can always move it later.</p>
<p dir="auto">We welcome contributions! If you'd like to contribute code, have a look at the tips in
