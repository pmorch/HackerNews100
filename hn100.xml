            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/03/usdod_data_dump/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/03/usdod_data_dump/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40566938">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Billions of records detailing people's personal information may soon be dumped online after being allegedly obtained from a Florida firm that handles background checks and other requests for folks' private info.</p>
<p>A criminal gang that goes by the handle USDoD put the database up for sale for <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/H4ckManac/status/1777246310782902686">$3.5 million</a> on an underworld forum in April, and rather incredibly claimed the trove included 2.9 billion records on all US, Canadian, and British citizens. It's believed one or more miscreants using the handle SXUL was responsible for the alleged exfiltration, who passed it onto USDoD, which is acting as a broker.</p>
<p>The pilfered information is said to include individuals' full names, addresses, and address history going back at least three decades, social security numbers, and people's parents, siblings, and relatives, some of whom have been dead for nearly 20 years. According to USDoD, this info was not scraped from public sources, though there may be duplicate entries for people in the database.</p>

    

<p>Fast forward to this month, and the infosec watchers at VX-Underground say they've not only <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1797047998481854512?s=46">been able to view</a> the database and verify that at least some of its contents are real and accurate, but that USDoD plans to leak the trove. Judging by VX-Underground's assessment, the 277.1GB file contains nearly three billion records on people who've at least lived in the United States – so US citizens as well as, say, Canadians and Brits.</p>

        

<p>This info was allegedly stolen or otherwise obtained from National Public Data, a small information broker based in Coral Springs that offers API lookups to other companies for things like background checks. The biz did not respond to <em>The Register</em>'s inquiries.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/21/transunion_data_dump/">TransUnion reckons big dump of stolen customer data came from someone else</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/13/airbus_data_leak/">Airbus suffers data leak turbulence to cybercrooks' delight</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/31/snowflake_breach_report/">Snowflake denies miscreants melted its security to steal data from top customers</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/31/cyber_cops_plead_for_info/">Cyber cops plead for info on elusive Emotet mastermind</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a small silver lining, according to the VX team: "The database DOES NOT contain information from individuals who use data opt-out services. Every person who used some sort of data opt-out service was not present." So, we guess this is a good lesson in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nationalpublicdata.com/optout.html">opting out</a>.</p>
<p>USDoD is the same crew that previously peddled a 3GB-plus database from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/21/transunion_data_dump/">TransUnion</a> containing financial information on 58,505 people.</p>
<p>And last September, the same criminals touted personal information belonging to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/13/airbus_data_leak/">3,200 Airbus vendors</a> after the aerospace giant fell victim to an intrusion. ®</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="http://oftheclock.com/sam-altman-lately">Sam Altman, Lately</a>
  </h2>
	<p>A few day ago, YCombinator boss Paul Graham <a href="https://x.com/paulg/status/1796107666265108940">posted an image</a> on X<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>, providing an explanation behind Altman’s departure from YCombinator’s main leadership position. Graham’s attempt to dispel rumors of Altman’s supposed firing didn’t work as well as hoped, with many of the responses reiterating that making him choose between OpenAI &amp; YCombinator still constituted a form of firing. However, the more substantial revelation was a few posts later.</p>

<p>While responding to replies, it seems that Graham was <a href="https://x.com/JacquesThibs/status/1796131984688738401">informed</a> — and later <a href="https://x.com/paulg/status/1796174494026879040">confirmed</a> — that Altman had, in a pretty clear conflict of interest and obviously unbeknownst to YCombinator leadership, invested a tidy sum of $10 million into OpenAI’s for-profit arm.</p>

<p>Not a great look.</p>

<p>This morning, the <strong><em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong> went even further with an expose on Altman’s burgeoning business empire, in a piece titled <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-sam-altman-investments-004fc785?mod=hp_lead_pos7">The Opaque Investment Empire Making OpenAI’s Sam Altman Rich</a></em>. According to the <em><strong>WSJ</strong></em>, Altman has:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…a sprawling investment empire that is becoming a direct beneficiary of OpenAI’s success.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Supposedly to the tune of about $2.8 billion.</p>

<p>Now, how does that happen when Altman only makes a small salary from OpenAI, and — according to him &amp; the company — doesn’t directly own any of it?</p>

<p>Altman’s personal investments range in everything from nuclear fission reactor start-up Helion to being the third largest public stake in Reddit. Reddit, one of the companies that has a content-sharing deal in place with OpenAI to train ChatGPT. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A growing number of Altman’s startups do business with OpenAI itself, either as customers or major business partners. The arrangement puts Altman on both sides of deals, creating a mounting list of potential conflicts in which he could personally benefit from OpenAI’s work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Directly, or indirectly, the streak of intentionally investing in companies that have a conflict of interest doesn’t seem to be declining, either — the exact opposite seems to be true. </p>

<p>Consequences of this dynamic can include placing employees in a real awkward situation, even if according to OpenAI he’s recused himself from some of the deals between the ChatGPT developer and outside companies he’s invested in. Even if he’s not involved in the deals directly, employees now have to consider that their boss is directly affected on each side of a deal, by decisions they could make, is almost sure to have an influence on the outcome. All while they’re supposed to be working for OpenAI’s benefit specifically.</p>

<p>Another article, also issued by the <strong><em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong>, aptly named “<em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/chatgpt-sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-b0e1c8c9?mod=article_inline">The Contradictions of Sam Altman, AI Crusader</a></em>”, touched on some of these issues in March of last year. In it, his investments in Helion ($375mil) &amp; Retro ($180mil) were stated as being “almost all of his liquid wealth.” He was also known to be apart of other projects — including Worldcoin — though the steep growth of his fortune, going from reported between $500-$700 million in March 2023, to $2.8 billion in less than 12 months later is pretty incredible. Especially given his public stance on the financing’s influence on AI’s development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He owns no stake in the ChatGPT developer, saying he doesn’t want the seductions of wealth to corrupt <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/chatgpt-sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-b0e1c8c9?mod=article_inline">the safe development of artificial intelligence</a>, and makes a yearly salary of just $65,000.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that he’s so clearly financially tied to OpenAI through a diverse set of investments kind of throws the idea that he only takes a $65,000 salary for altruistic reasons directly out of the window. It also lends insight to the leadership dust-up last year.</p>

<p>In November, OpenAI ousted Altman. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166713/openai-helen-toner-explains-why-sam-altman-was-fired">This recent piece</a> by <strong><em>The Verge</em></strong> expounds on the initial reasoning of the board that, at the time, didn’t trust Altman. One of the cited reasons was Altman’s failure to inform the board of his ownership of the OpenAI Startup Fund. Seems like there is a pattern here.</p>

<p>Transparency is probably something Altman would do well to take steps to personally improve, especially after a majority of the board members who pushed out Altman were, as a result of his deal to return, pushed out themselves, resulting in even less oversight. Less critical oversight, at least. Let’s hope — as Altman would put it — for the safety of artificial intelligence, and therefore humanity as whole, transparency does improve across the board. That’s really all we can ask for, given that asking people to <em>actually</em> put financial gain aside as a motivating factor doesn’t seem to historically work out.</p>

As the shaft went deeper, progress declined to less than a meter per hour—a rate that finally decreased to zero as the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190503-the-deepest-hole-we-have-ever-dug" target="_blank">work was abandoned in 1992.</a> That attempt and similar projects have made it clear that conventional drills are no match for the high temperatures and pressures deep in the Earth’s crust.</p><h3>Microwaves meet rocks<br></h3><p>“But an energy beam doesn’t have those kinds of limits,” says <a href="https://www.psfc.mit.edu/people/senior-scientists/paul-p-woskov" target="_blank">Paul Woskov</a>, senior research engineer at MIT’s <a href="https://www.psfc.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Plasma Science and Fusion Center</a>. Woskov spent decades working with powerful microwave beams, steering them into precise locations to heat hydrogen fuel above 100 million degrees to initiate fusion reactions.<br></p><p>“It wasn’t much of a jump to make the connection that if we can melt steel chambers and vaporize them, we could melt rocks.” <strong>—Paul Woskov, MIT</strong></p><p>“I was already aware that these sources were quite damaging to materials because one of the challenges is not to melt the inner chamber of a tokamak,” a device that confines a plasma using magnetic fields. “So it wasn’t much of a jump to make the connection that if we can melt steel chambers and vaporize them, we could melt rocks.”<br></p><p>In 2008, Woskov began intensively studying whether the approach could be an affordable improvement on mechanical drilling. The research led to hands-on experiments in which Woskov used a <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/paul-woskov-explores-new-path-through-earth-crust-0412" target="_blank">small gyrotron to blast through bricks of basalt</a>.<br></p><p>Based on his experiments and other research, Woskov calculated that a millimeter-wave source targeted through a roughly 20 centimeter waveguide could blast a basketball-size hole into rock at a rate of 20 meters per hour. At that rate, 25-and-a-half days of continuous drilling would create the world’s deepest hole.<br></p><p>“It was evident that if we could get it to work, we could drill very deep holes for a very small fraction of what it costs now,” says Wostov. Although Woskov is credited as a founder of Quaise, he says he has no financial stake in the company—unlike MIT.<br></p><h3>A wave of possibilities<br></h3><p>The Quaise design calls for a corrugated metal tube to serve as a waveguide, which would be extracted after drilling is completed. The system would rely on injected gas to quench and carry out ash.</p><p>“Instead of pumping fluid and turning a drill, we’ll be burning and vaporizing rock and extracting gas, which is much easier to pump than mud.” <strong>—Carlos Araque, Quaise Energy</strong></p><p>“We will need about a megawatt to power it, the same amount of energy as a typical drilling rig,” says Araque. ”But we’ll be using it in very different ways. Instead of pumping fluid and turning a drill, we’ll be burning and vaporizing rock and extracting gas, which is much easier to pump than mud.”<br></p><p>Using the waveguide to direct energy to the targeted rock allows the energy source to stay on the surface. That may sound like a stretch, but the concept was tested in a <a href="https://archive.org/details/bstj56-10-1825/mode/1up" target="_blank">1970s experiment</a> in which Bell Labs built a <a href="https://nickvsnetworking.com/mmwave-5g-in-the-1960s/" target="_blank">14 km waveguide transmission medium</a> in northern New Jersey. The researchers found that it could transmit millimeter waves with <a href="http://www.boblucky.com/Papers/leadership.htm" target="_blank">very little attenuation</a>.</p><p>Quaise intends to first target industrial customers with a need for steam at a guaranteed flow rate, temperature, and pressure. “Our goal is to match the specs of an industrial load,” says Araque. “They can retire the boiler, and we’ll give them 500º C steam on-site.”</p><p>Eventually, the company hopes the technology could enable new geothermal electric plants, or allow turbines formerly heated by fossil fuels to be repurposed—supplying the grid with an estimated 25-50 megawatts of electricity from each well.</p><p>The company plans to begin field demonstrations this autumn, using a prototype device to drill holes in hard rock at a site in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_Falls,_Texas" target="_blank">Marble Falls, Tex</a>. From there, Quaise plans to build a full-size demonstration rig in a high-geothermal zone in the western United States.</p><p><img id="30faf" data-rm-shortcode-id="e7ed45f6f4b79c45944298a4d525aa1d" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image-of-a-rock-surface-with-a-melted-hole-in-the-middle-that-appears-to-extend-deep-into-the-rock-surface.jpg?id=51875667&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image-of-a-rock-surface-with-a-melted-hole-in-the-middle-that-appears-to-extend-deep-into-the-rock-surface.jpg?id=51875667&amp;width=980" width="3024" height="2451" alt="Image of a rock surface with a melted hole in the middle that appears to extend deep into the rock surface"><small data-gramm="false" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-606527" placeholder="Add Photo Caption..." spellcheck="false">Quaise Energy drilled a hole 254 centimeters (100 inches) deep with a 2.5 cm diameter into a column of basalt, making it 100 times the depth of the team’s original tests, as conducted at MIT.</small><small data-gramm="false" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-146495" placeholder="Add Photo Credit..." spellcheck="false">Quaise Energy</small></p><h3>Facing the depths<br></h3><p>Although laboratory data have demonstrated the feasibility of scaling up the approach, the technical obstacles to the Quaise plan are likely to run deeper than its radical drilling method.</p><p>“If they can actually drill a 10 km hole using high-powered microwaves, that will be a significant engineering achievement,” says <a href="https://www.cheme.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/jefferson-w-tester" target="_blank">Jefferson Tester</a>, who studies geothermal energy extraction in subsurface rock reservoirs at Cornell University. “But the challenge is completing those wells so they don’t fall apart, particularly if you’re going to start removing fluids from underground and changing the temperature profile.</p><p>“Drilling a hole is challenging enough,” says Tester. “But actually running the reservoir and getting the energy out of the ground safely may be something very, very far off in the future.”</p><p><em>This article appears in the June 2024 print issue as “Geothermal Company Taps Into Old Fusion Tech.”</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Recently, the Linux Mint Blog published <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4675" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Monthly News – April 2024</a>, which goes into detail about wanting to fork and maintain older GNOME apps in collaboration with other GTK-based desktop environments.</p>

<p>Despite the good intentions of the author, Clem, many readers interpreted this as an attack against GNOME. Specifically: <a href="https://gtk.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GTK</a>, <a href="https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">libadwaita</a>, the relationship between them, and their relevance to any desktop environment or desktop operating system. Unfortunately, many of these readers seem to have a lot of difficulty understanding what GTK <em>is</em> trying to be, and how libadwaita helps.</p>

<p>In this article, we’ll look at the history of why and how libadwaita was born, the differences between GTK 4 and libadwaita in terms of scope of support, their relevance to each desktop environment and desktop operating system, and the state of GTK 4 today.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-gtk">
  
  
    What Is GTK?<a href="#what-is-gtk" title="Permalink to “What Is GTK?”" aria-label="Permalink to “What Is GTK?”">§</a>
  
  
</h2>
    

<p>First of all, what is GTK? GTK is a cross-platform widget toolkit from the GNOME Project, which means it provides interactive elements that developers can use to build their apps.</p>

<p>The latest major release of GTK is 4, which brings performance improvements over GTK 3. GTK 4 also removes several widgets that were part of the GNOME design language, which became a controversy. In the context of application design, a <em>design language</em> is the visual characteristics that are communicated to the user. Fonts, colors, shapes, forms, layouts, writing styles, spacing, etc. are all elements of the design language.<sup><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/visual-design-language-building-blocks/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">(Source)</a></sup></p>

    

<p>In general, cross-platform toolkits tend to provide general-purpose/standard widgets, typically with a non-opinionated styling, i.e. widgets and design patterns that are used consistently across different operating systems (OSes) and desktop environments.</p>

<p>However, GTK had the unique case of bundling GNOME’s design language into GTK, which made it far from generic, leading to problems of different lexicons, mainly philosophical and technical problems.</p>
<h3 id="clash-of-philosophies">
  
  
    Clash of Philosophies<a href="#clash-of-philosophies" title="Permalink to “Clash of Philosophies”" aria-label="Permalink to “Clash of Philosophies”">§</a>
  
  
</h3>
    

<p>When we look at apps made for the GNOME desktop (will be referred to as “GNOME apps”) as opposed to non-GNOME apps, we notice that they’re distinctive: GNOME apps tend to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">hamburger buttons</a>, larger buttons, larger padding and margins, etc., while most non-GNOME apps tend to be more compact, use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_bar" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">menu bars</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/basics/titlebar-design#standard-design" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">standard title bars</a>, and many other design metaphors that may not be used in GNOME apps.</p>

<p>This is because, from a design philosophy standpoint, GNOME’s design patterns tend to go in a different direction than most apps. As a brand and product, GNOME has a design language it adheres to, which is accompanied by the GNOME <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/hig" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Human Interface Guidelines</a> (HIG).</p>

<p>As a result, GTK and GNOME’s design language clashed together. Instead of being as general-purpose as possible, GTK as a cross-platform toolkit contained an entire design language intended to be used only by a specific desktop, thus defeating the purpose of a cross-platform toolkit.</p>

<p><em>For more information on GNOME’s design philosophy, see “<a href="https://tesk.page/2023/04/02/what-is-gnomes-philosophy/">What is GNOME’s Philosophy?</a>”.</em></p>
<h3 id="inefficient-diversion-of-resources">
  
  
    Inefficient Diversion of Resources<a href="#inefficient-diversion-of-resources" title="Permalink to “Inefficient Diversion of Resources”" aria-label="Permalink to “Inefficient Diversion of Resources”">§</a>
  
  
</h3>
    

<p>The unnecessary unification of the toolkit and design language also divided a significant amount of effort and maintenance: Instead of focusing solely on the general-purpose widgets that could be used across all desktop OSes and environments, much of the focus was on the widgets that were intended to conform to the GNOME HIG. Many of the general-purpose widgets also included features and functionality that were only relevant to the GNOME desktop, making them less general-purpose.</p>

<p>Thus, the general-purpose widgets were being implemented and improved slowly, and the large codebase also made the GNOME widgets and design language difficult to maintain, change, and adapt. In other words, almost everything was hindered by the lack of independence on both sides.</p>
<h3 id="libhandy-the-predecessor">
  
  
    Libhandy: the Predecessor<a href="#libhandy-the-predecessor" title="Permalink to “Libhandy: the Predecessor”" aria-label="Permalink to “Libhandy: the Predecessor”">§</a>
  
  
</h3>
    

<p>Because of the technical bottlenecks caused by the philosophical decisions, <a href="https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libhandy" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">libhandy</a> was created <a href="https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/-/commit/d7b066dcac396ec65904a632fb91f63abe5b42cc" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">in 2017</a>, with the first experimental version released in <a href="https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/-/commit/6b34695abbf64281f5a2879bd82fa5e8469ba7da" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2018</a>. As described on the website, libhandy is a collection of “[b]uilding blocks for modern adaptive GNOME applications.” In other words, libhandy provides additional widgets that can be used by GNOME apps, especially those that use GTK 3. For example, <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-boxes/-/blob/f253b5c9bc908c2c53ad7676394c25fd60d05410/src/meson.build#L105" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Boxes uses libhandy</a>, and many GNOME apps that used to use GTK 3 also used libhandy.</p>

<p>However, some of the problems remained: Since libhandy was relatively new at the time, most GNOME widgets were still part of GTK 3, which continued to suffer from the consequences of merging the toolkit and design language. Furthermore, GTK 4 was released at the end of December 2020 — after libhandy. Since libhandy was created before the initial release of GTK 4, it made little sense to fully address these issues in GTK 3, especially when doing so would have caused major breakages and inconveniences for GTK, libhandy, and app developers. As such, it wasn’t worth the effort.</p>

<p>With these issues in mind, the best course of action was to introduce all these major changes and breakages in GTK 4, use libhandy as an experiment and to gain experience, and properly address these issues in a successor.</p>
<h2 id="libadwaita-the-successor">
  
  
    Libadwaita: the Successor<a href="#libadwaita-the-successor" title="Permalink to “Libadwaita: the Successor”" aria-label="Permalink to “Libadwaita: the Successor”">§</a>
  
  
</h2>
    

<p>Because of all the above problems, libadwaita was created: libhandy’s successor that will accompany GTK 4.</p>

<p>GTK 4 was initially released in <a href="https://blog.gtk.org/2020/12/16/gtk-4-0/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">December 2020</a>, and libadwaita was released one year later, in <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/alicem/2021/12/31/libadwaita-1-0/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">December 2021</a>. With the experience gained from libhandy, libadwaita managed to become extensible and easy to maintain.</p>

<p>Libadwaita is a platform library accompanying GTK 4. A <em>platform library</em> is a library used to complement a specific platform. In the case of libadwaita, the platform it targets is the GNOME desktop.</p>
<h3 id="porting-widgets-to-libadwaita">
  
  
    Porting Widgets to Libadwaita<a href="#porting-widgets-to-libadwaita" title="Permalink to “Porting Widgets to Libadwaita”" aria-label="Permalink to “Porting Widgets to Libadwaita”">§</a>
  
  
</h3>
    

<p>Some GNOME widgets from GTK 3 (or earlier versions of GTK 4) were removed or deprecated in GTK 4 and were reimplemented in / transferred to libadwaita, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<del><a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Dialog.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GtkDialog</a></del> → <a href="https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/main/class.Dialog.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AdwDialog</a>
</li>
  <li>
<del><a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.InfoBar.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GtkInfoBar</a></del> → <a href="https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/main/class.Banner.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AdwBanner</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>These aforementioned widgets only benefited GNOME apps, as they were strictly designed to provide widgets that conformed to the GNOME HIG. Non-GNOME apps usually didn’t use these widgets, so they were practically irrelevant to everyone else.</p>

<p>In addition, libadwaita introduced several widgets as counterparts to GTK 4 to comply with the HIG:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.HeaderBar.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GtkHeaderBar</a> → <a href="https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/main/class.HeaderBar.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AdwHeaderBar</a>

<p>Similarly, these aforementioned GTK 4 (the ones starting with <code>Gtk</code>) widgets are not designed to comply with the GNOME HIG. Since GTK 4 widgets are supposed to be general-purpose, they should not be platform-specific; the HIG no longer has any influence on GTK, only on the development of libadwaita.</p>

<p>The main difference between GTK 4 and libadwaita is the scope of support, specifically the priorities in terms of the GNOME desktop, and desktop environment and OS support. While the GNOME desktop is the top priority for both GTK and libadwaita, GTK 4 is nowhere near as focused on the GNOME desktop as libadwaita is. GTK 4, while opinionated, still tries to get closer to the traditional desktop metaphor by providing these general-purpose widgets, while libadwaita provides custom widgets to conform to the GNOME HIG.</p>

<p>Since libadwaita is only made for the GNOME desktop, and the GNOME desktop is primarily officially supported on Linux, libadwaita thus primarily supports Linux. In contrast, GTK is officially supported on all major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux). However, since GTK 4 is mostly developed by GNOME developers, it works best on Linux and <span>GNOME — hence</span> “opinionated”.</p>

<p>Thanks to the removal of GNOME widgets from GTK 4, GTK developers can continue to work on general-purpose widgets, without being influenced or restricted in any way by the GNOME HIG. Developers of cross-platform GTK 3 apps that rely exclusively on general-purpose widgets can be more confident that GTK 4 won’t remove these widgets, and hopefully enjoy the benefits that GTK 4 offers.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, there are several cross-platform apps that have either successfully ported to GTK 4, or are currently in the process of doing so. To name a few: <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/org.freeciv.gtk4" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Freeciv gtk4 client</a>, <a href="https://handbrake.fr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HandBrake</a>, <a href="https://inkscape.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Inkscape</a>, and <a href="https://transmissionbt.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Transmission</a>. The <a href="https://libreoffice.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LibreOffice</a> developers are working on the GTK 4 port, with the <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/GTK4" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><code>gtk4</code> VCL plugin</a> option enabled. For example, the <a href="https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/libreoffice-fresh/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><code>libreoffice-fresh</code></a> package from Arch Linux has it <a href="https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/libreoffice-fresh/-/blob/d5fc44b4659c0512fea49277d04ca505bd4e5299/PKGBUILD#L202" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">enabled</a>.</p>

<p>While libadwaita is the most popular and widely used platform library that accompanies GTK 4, there are several alternatives to libadwaita:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://valadoc.org/granite-7/index.htm" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Granite</a> is developed and maintained by <a href="https://elementary.io/brand" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">elementary, Inc.</a>, and focuses on <a href="https://elementary.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">elementary OS</a> and the Pantheon desktop. Apps that use Granite can be found in the <a href="https://appcenter.elementary.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">elementary AppCenter</a>.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://docs.developers.tauos.co/libhelium/libhelium-1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Libhelium</a> is developed and maintained by <a href="https://fyralabs.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Fyra Labs</a>, and focuses on <a href="https://tauos.co/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">tauOS</a>. Apps using libhelium can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/topics/libhelium" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“libhelium” topics on GitHub</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just like libadwaita, these platform libraries offer custom widgets and styling that differ from GTK and are built for their respective platforms, so it’s important to realize that <strong>GTK is meant to be built with a complementary platform library that extends its functionality <u>when targeting a specific platform</u></strong>.</p>

<p>Similarly, <a href="https://develop.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami//" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kirigami</a> from KDE accompanies Qt to build Plasma apps. <a href="https://mauikit.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MauiKit</a> from the Maui Project (another KDE project) also accompanies Qt, but targets <a href="https://nxos.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nitrux</a>. <a href="https://pop-os.github.io/libcosmic/cosmic/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Libcosmic</a> by System76 accompanies <a href="https://iced.rs/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">iced</a> to build COSMIC apps.</p>

</h2>
    

<p>A cross-platform toolkit should primarily provide general-purpose widgets. Third parties should be able to extend the toolkit as they see fit through a platform library if they want to target a specific platform.</p>

<p>As we’ve seen throughout the philosophical and technical issues with GTK, a lot of effort has gone into moving GNOME widgets from GTK 4 to libadwaita. GTK 4 will continue to provide these general-purpose widgets for apps intended to run on any desktop or OS, while platform libraries such as libadwaita, Granite and libhelium provide styling and custom widgets that respect their respective platforms.</p>

<p>Libadwaita is targeted exclusively at the GNOME ecosystem, courtesy of the GNOME HIG. Apps built with libadwaita are intended to run best on GNOME, while GTK 4 apps that don’t come with a platform library are intended to run everywhere.</p>

<h2>If English was written like Chinese</h2>

<hr>

<i>Also see the <a href="http://www.fatcow.com/edu/yingzi-be/">Belorussian translation</a> provided by <a href="http://www.fatcow.com/">Fatcow</a>.</i>

<hr>

<p>The English spelling system is such a pain, we'd might as well switch to <i>hanzi</i>-- Chinese characters.  How should we go about it?

</p><h3>Japanese style</h3>

<p>One way would be to use hanzi directly, asthe Japanese do.  For instance, we'd write "work" as <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/gang.gif">, and "ruler" as <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/jun.gif">.  Chinese and Japanese borrowings could be written using the original hanzi, e.g. "gung-ho" would be <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/gang.gif"><img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/he.gif">, and "tycoon" as <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/da.gif"><img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/jun.gif">.  

</p><p>You can already see that this is going to be tricky.  We've just given <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/gang.gif"> two readings, for instance-- /wrk/ and /gûng/-- and <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/jun.gif"> two as well-- /rulr/ and /kun/.  

</p><p>Proper names will be a problem as well.  Again, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean names already have hanzi forms-- e.g. <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/fayename.gif"> for the name of the bodaciously cute singer <a href="http://www.tezcat.com/~markrose/faye.html">Faye Wong</a>-- but for English names we'd have no better recourse than to spell things out using the nearest Chinese syllables.  For instance, Winston Churchill would be represented by hanzi that would be transliterated <i>Wensuteng Chuerqilu.</i>

</p><h3>Chinese style</h3>

<p>Maybe there's a better approach.  Instead of using hanzi directly, let's invent a new system-- we'll call it <i>yingzi</i>, "English characters"-- that would work for English exactly as hanzi works for Chinese.

</p><p>The basic principle will be, <b>one yingzi for a syllable with a particular meaning.</b>  So <i>two</i>, <i>to</i>, and <i>too</i> will each have their own yingzi.  (If we were creating a syllabary, by contrast, we'd write all three with the same symbol, the one for /tu/.)

</p><p>Does that mean we need a completely separate symbol for each of the thousands of possible English syllables?  Not at all.  We can simplify the task enormously with one more principle: <b>syllables that rhyme can have yingzi that are variations on a theme</b>.

</p><h3>Little pictures</h3>

<p>You've been reading for half a page and are probably wondering why I haven't yet talked about pictograms.  When do we get to draw little pictures?

</p><p>Well, now's the time.  Let's draw pictures.  For instance:

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/horse.gif"><br><i>horse</i>
</td><td><img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/mount.gif"><br><i>mount</i>
</td><td><img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/king.gif"><br><i>king</i>
</td><td><img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/man.gif"><br><i>man</i>
</td><td><img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/child.gif"><br><i>child</i>
</td><td><img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/bug.gif"><br><i>bug</i>
</td><td><img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/sun.gif"><br><i>sun</i>
</td><td><img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/moon.gif"><br><i>moon</i>
</td><td><img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/tree.gif"><br><i>tree</i>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

When the pictures are abstract we can call them "ideograms", but they still represent particular English morphemes:



Some of our pictures will be kind of clever.  For instance, <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/woods.gif"> <i>woods</i> repeats the yingzi for <i>tree</i>, while <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/east.gif"> <i>east</i> is a little picture of the sun rising through the trees.  <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/guilt.gif"> <i>guilt</i> is a picture of a man inside an enclosure.  

</p><p>Let's not go crazy, however.  We only need a thousand or so, and we'll restrict ourselves to fairly simple, one-syllable words.  We'll derive the vast majority of our yingzi from this basic stock of pictures. 

</p><h3>Phonetic classes</h3>

<p>Basically each simple yingzi will be the basis for an open-ended set of yingzi, used for a set of <b>rhyming syllables</b>.  For instance, the <i>king </i>character <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/king.gif"> will generate the family <i>king</i>, <i>thing, sing, sling, sting, shing(le).</i>   

</p><p>It would be awfully confusing to use <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/king.gif"> for all of these.  Instead we'll use it only for <i>king</i>, which will be the <b>phonetic</b> for this set, and add little signs called <b>radicals</b> to distinguish the rest.  Examples:

</p>

When we add a radical, we scrunch up the yingzi so the whole thing still fits into a square.  All characters, however complex, fit into the same size box. 

<p>"Rhyming" isn't quite accurate.  We don't want each family of words to get <i>too</i> large; so we'll restrict a single family to either voiced or unvoiced initial consonants.  

</p><p>So, <i>bring, ring, Bing, wing, zing</i> will form a separate family of yingzi, based on the character <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/wing.gif"> <i>wing.</i> 

</p><h3>Overlaps and secondary derivations</h3>

<p>The yingzi formed from a single phonetic will all rhyme; but not all syllables that rhyme will necessarily have the same yingzi.  This is largely because we started with a set of pictograms chosen for their pictorial rather than phonetic qualities; but it also adds visual distinctions to the script, and thus aids the reader.  (It rather burdens the writer; but heck, everyone does a lot more reading than writing.) 

</p><p>For instance, the phonetic <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/not.gif"> <i>un- </i>will be used for <i>fun, ton, pun, thun(der), Hun,</i> etc.  But <i>sun</i> will have its own yingzi, <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/sun.gif">, and this will be used for <i>son, shun, stun, spun</i>.  For instance, <i>sun</i> plus the <i>man</i> radical makes <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/son.gif"> <i>son</i>, and <i>sun </i>with the <i>fight</i> radical is used for <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/shun.gif"> <i>shun</i>.

</p><p>Moreover, a compound yingzi may itself be used as a phonetic with its own set of yingzi.  The <i>shun</i> character <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/shun.gif">, for instance, will be used with the <i>work</i> radical to form <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/tion.gif"> <i>-tion</i>, used to spell this common suffix, as in <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/sect.gif"><img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/tion.gif"> <i>section</i>.

</p><h3>Radicals</h3>

<p>Where do the radicals come from?  For the most part they are either simple characters (e.g <i>king, work</i>), or abbreviations of characters; for instance the character <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/net.gif"> <i>net</i> is abbreviated to <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/netr.gif"> when used as a radical.

</p><p>The set of radicals is not unlimited; there is in fact a <b>fixed set</b> of 214 of them.  The total number of yingzi that belong to one phonetic set is thus absolutely limited to 214.  No set will actually have this number of yingzi, though some will have a few dozen.

</p><p>(However, the potential number of yingzi is still unlimited, because we can always choose a compound yingzi as a new phonetic, and generate a new set of rhyming yingzi from it.)

</p><p>Because the set of radicals is limited, a really good radical will not always be available to distinguish the yingzi in a rhyming set.  We'll just choose the best one we can.  In addition, when choosing radicals we will rely on the <b>etymological</b> meaning of a word, which may not always match its current meaning.  For instance, the word <i>villain</i> originally meant <i>peasant</i>, and so the sign for <i>vill-</i> <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/vill.gif"> uses the <i>field</i> radical (added to the phonetic <i>bill</i>). 

</p><p>The yingzi that use a particular radical will form a class of their own-- a sort of <b>meaning class</b>.  We can consider the entire English language to be divided into 214 meaning categories.  For instance, every yingzi that uses the <i>bug</i> radical will have something to do (at least etymologically) with insects or reptiles.  However, since the number of radicals is so limited, and because the choice of radical is sometimes quirky, the resulting sets will be rather vague and eccentric.

</p><h3>Guessing at an unknown character</h3>

<p>There will be tens of thousands of yingzi; but we must not let this frighten us.  There are tens of thousands of conventional spellings, too, but despite what the wiseacres say, it would be absurd to say that there's no logic to English orthography at all.  Likewise, the yingzi themselves are not the basic graphical units or <b>graphemes</b> of the writing system; the phonetics and radicals are.

</p><p>Readers can make use of this fact to guess the pronunciation of an unknown character.  For instance, <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/curse.gif"> is a straightforward combination of the <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/speak.gif"> <i>speech </i>radical with the phonetic <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/purse.gif"> <i>purse</i>.  A type of speaking that rhymes with purse-- <i>curse</i>, of course.

</p><p>Or, <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/wilt.gif">, a combination of the <i>plant</i> radical <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/plant.gif"> with the <i>guilt </i>phonetic <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/guilt.gif">.  Something about plants that rhymes with guilt?  This one is a bit harder-- <i>wilt</i>.

</p><p><img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/peach.gif"> -- a plant (radical <i> plant</i>) that rhymes with <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/speak.gif"> <i>speech</i>-- is easy: <i>peach</i>.  But note that <i>speech</i>, which we used as a radical above, is used as a phonetic here. 

</p><p>Since there are many more phonetics than radicals, the <b>information content</b> of the radical is much less than that of the phonetic.  If you knew only the radical for an unknown character, you can only narrow down the meaning to 1/214 of the lexicon; if you knew only the phonetic, you could narrow it down much further, since there are more than a thousand phonetics. 

</p><h3>Polysyllabic words</h3>

<p>Where possible we will divide a word into morphemes.  For instance <i>outsider</i> breaks into <i>out + side + -er</i>; reshipment is <i>re- + ship + -ment</i>.

</p><p>How do we handle morphemes of more than one syllable?  We simply create a yingzi for each syllable.  For instance, <i>person</i> would be expressed as <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/pers.gif"><img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/son.gif">.  The first character is based on <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/per.gif"> <i>per</i>, with the addition of the <i>man</i> radical; the second is <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/sun.gif"> <i>sun</i> with the addition of the same radical.

</p><p>A polysyllabic morpheme, in fact, can generally be recognized because all the syllables have the same radical.  For instance, <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/insect.gif"> <i>insect</i> consists of <i>in </i>and <i> sect</i>, each with the addition of the <i>bug</i> radical.  (Note that <i>sect</i> is itself a compound character, formed from the <i>rite</i> radical with the <i>specked</i> phonetic.)

</p><h3>Inflections</h3>

<p>How about inflections that don't form a full syllable, such as plural <i>-s</i>?  It would be pretty tiresome, even with the add-a-radical trick, to create thousands of yingzi for syllables that just happen to have a final <i>-s</i>.  

</p><p>Note, however, that the plural morpheme sometimes takes up its own syllable, as in <i>grasses</i>, <i>rashes</i>.  So why not use the yingzi for <i>is</i>, which is <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/is.gif">?  Of course, <i>is</i> and <i>-s</i> are both pretty common, so we should add a little dot to the character to represent final -s: <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/s.gif">  So <i>peach</i> is <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/peach.gif">, <i>peaches</i> is <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/peach.gif"><img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/s.gif">; <i>sun</i> is <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/sun.gif">, <i>suns</i> is <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/sun.gif"><img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/s.gif">.  We can use a similar strategy for other inflections.

</p><h3>Foreign words</h3>

<p>Very old borrowings (e.g. the mass of words borrowed in medieval and Renaissance times from French and Latin) will be treated like native words.  We've already seen examples like <i><peach> peach, <vill><in-p> villain, <in+sect> insect, and <per><son> person.</son></per></in+sect></in-p></vill></peach></i>

</p><p>Words borrowed more recently, however, won't get their own radical+phonetic compounds.  Instead we'll represent them, syllable by syllable, using the nearest existing characters.  For instance, <i>Peking</i> will be represented as <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/seeg.gif"><img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/king.gif">.  The first character is the first syllable of <i>pecan</i> (that is, <i>pe-;</i> phonetic <i>see</i>, radical <i>gourd</i>), and the second is the word <i>king.  </i>The name <a name="fellini"><i>Fellini</i></a> will be written <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/fell.gif"><img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/bean.gif"><img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/knee.gif">, composed of the yinzi <i>fell, lean, knee</i>.  (You may amuse yourself working out <a href="#answers">what the phonetics and radicals are</a> for these three characters.)

</p><h3>Dictionaries</h3>

<p>English dictionaries would no longer be arranged alphabetically, of course, since we're no longer using an alphabet.  They'll be organized <b>by radical</b>.

</p><p>The 214 radicals are ordered according to the number of strokes needed to draw them.  Radicals of one stroke (e.g. <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/one.gif"> <i>one</i> or <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/per.gif"> <i>per</i> ) come first, followed by radicals of two strokes (e.g. <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/not.gif"> <i>un-</i>), and so on, up to monstrosities like <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/toad.gif"> <i>toad</i>, which has 20 strokes. 

</p><p>The section for each radical is also organized by stroke number.  Under the <i>plant</i> radical, for instance, the first entry is <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/plant.gif"> <i>plant</i> itself, followed by characters with one extra stroke (like <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/dron.gif"><i> dron</i>, the last character in rhododendron), then characters with two strokes, and so on (up to <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/toads.gif">, the first character in <i>toadstool</i>).

</p><p>Note that there are no main entries for what we're used to calling <b>words</b> at all.  There wouldn't be a main entry at all for a word like <i>person</i>, for instance.  There would be an entry for the <i>man</i> radical; under it a sub-entry for the <per-> character<i> per</i>, and <i>person</i> would be listed as a sub-sub-entry under that.

</per-></p><h3>Thinking in yingzi </h3>

<p>The nature of the writing system would encourage lexicographers (and English speakers) to think of everything in the language as <b>built out of yingzi</b>.  There wouldn't seem to be a great difference between "words" like <i>storehouse</i>, <i>storage, restore </i>and "expressions" like <i>shoe store, store up, store detective, store manager</i>; or between <i>blackboard</i> and <i>black eye</i>, or between <i>alphabet</i> and <i>alpha male</i>.

</p><p>Many morphemes that now live out a shadowy existence, forever bound to other morphemes, would take on an <b>independent existence</b>; for instance the <i>volve</i> in <i>revolve, evolve, involve, devolve</i>, which would have its own yingzi, and would seem as much a "word" or component of the language as the <i>match</i> in <i>rematch, mismatch, unmatch</i>.  There would be a tendency to describe the meanings, vague or miscellaneous as they might be, for such characters.

</p><p>This might seem sensible and even wise for a morpheme like <i>volve</i>, which after all derives from a real Latin root meaning <i>roll</i>; but there would be other, more <b>dubious applications</b>.  For instance, the <i>son</i> in <i>person </i>was represented by <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/son.gif">, which happens to be the yingzi for <i>son.</i>  It will be almost impossible not to assume that <i>person</i> derives from <i>son</i>; but historically it's just a coincidence; <i>person </i>derives from Latin and has nothing to do with <i>son</i>.

</p><p>Worse yet, the -<i>cuit</i> of <i>biscuit</i> and <i>circuit</i> might be written with the same character (a derivative of <i>kit</i>), and a meaning sought for it-- perhaps 'round', since biscuits are round and circuits involve going round.  Again, etymologically this is nonsense.

</p><p>Words, perceived as compounds, might lend themselves to <b>abbreviation</b>.  After all, why write two yingzi when one will do, especially if it unmistakably implies its partner?  For instance, <i>language</i> would be a two-character word <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/lang.gif"><img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/gwidge.gif">, each character defined only as part of this compound and used nowhere else in the language.  If you've written <lang> <i>lang</i>, you must write <gwidge> <i>gwidge</i> next.  You might as well just write <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/lang.gif"> <i>lang</i> and leave it at that.  Ultimately of course <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/lang.gif"> will acquire a meaning of its own-- namely <i>language.  </i>And for consistency's sake lexicographers might well give <i>gwidge</i> a meaning of its own as well--namely, <i>language</i>.

</gwidge></lang></p><p>The complexities of the writing system, the inherent interest of the pictorial elements, the cleverness inherent in graphic compounds like <woods><i> woods</i> and the radical-phonetic system, and even sociological facts such as the time it takes to learn the system, and the fact that English speakers of all nations can use it whatever their native dialect, would also combine to give the writing system an <b>overwhelming character</b> of its own.  It would be seen as more important than speech; there would even be a tendency to think of <b>words as derived from characters</b> rather than the other way around.  

</woods></p><p>If someone asks where a word comes from, we (now) think of its original phonetic form; we say for instance that <i>language</i> comes from French<i> langage</i>, itself derived from Latin <i>lingua</i> 'tongue', which in turn comes from Proto-Indo-European <i>dnghu</i>.  With the yingzi system, people would be tempted instead to give what we might call the <b>graphic etymology</b>.  They'd say that <i>lang</i> derives from the <i>speech</i> radical and the <i>gang </i>phonetic, and that the latter is actually a picture of a gang-- a reduplication of the <i>man</i> character.  That is indeed where <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/lang.gif"> comes from, but not <i>lang</i>, which did not derive from it!  (But it wouldn't even be easy to make this point in yingzi-- how do you distinguish <i>lang</i> from <img src="https://zompist.com/yingzi/lang.gif"> if you can't even write "lang" without writing the character?)

</p><h3>A word is a word is a word</h3>

<p>Does all this mean that <b>words are cultural constructs</b> or that the concept of a word would no longer apply to English written in yingzi?  Not at all.  A <b>word</b> is still a useful linguistic concept-- or rather a series of overlapping concepts.  By <i>word</i> linguists may mean one or all of the following:

</p><ul>
<li>a phonological unit-- e.g. something with one stress accent or one pitch contour; or a unit within which intervocalic stops get voiced. 
</li><li>the abstraction underlying a set of morphological forms (e.g. <i>write</i> underlying <i>write, writes, writing, written, wrote</i>).
</li><li>an element which can stand alone (e.g. in response to a suitably chosen question), as suffixes or bound morphemes cannot.
</li><li>a morphological unit you can't insert other morphemes into (e.g. <i>black dog</i> is not a word since you can change it to <i>black, tired dog</i>; but you can't turn <i>blackbird</i> into <i>blacktiredbird</i>) 
</li><li>an expression with a conventional meaning-- something that has to be defined in the mental lexicon (this sense is also called a <b>lexeme</b>).
</li></ul>

<p>A moment's thought should show that these definitions <b>may or may not coincide</b> even in English; and that even where they do they may not coincide with the <b>typographical</b> or lexicographical notion of a word.  The latter idea-- roughly 'something with spaces around it'-- is of little interest to linguists since it depends on the writing system.  That makes it useless for describing most of the languages of the world; and even for written languages it's pretty arbitrary, as this page should show.  (Everything you know about writing English would change if we adopted yingzi instead.) 

</p><p>It's safe to say, however, that such definitions would seem fairly abstract in a yingzi system.  <i>Word</i> might become a technical term, like <i>morpheme</i> or <i>lexeme</i>.  Or it might be identified with a yingzi (a written character); or be abstracted into a more vaguely defined linguistic element, applicable to anything from a character to a compound to a whole phrase. 

</p><hr>
<h3>Hey, did I just learn something about Chinese?</h3>

<p>I've attempted in this sketch to lay out, by analogy, the nature and structure of the Chinese writing system.  All of the concepts apply: 

</p><ul>
<li>the limited role of pictograms
</li><li>the clever compound pictures (indeed all three examples are from Chinese)
</li><li>the phonetic-and-radical system (97% of Chinese characters work this way) 
</li><li>the inclusion of radicals as part of the character (rather than as separate symbols, as in cuneiform or hieroglyphic writing) 
</li><li>the relative information content of radicals and phonetics
</li><li>compounds used as secondary phonetics
</li><li>the handling of multisyllabic and foreign words
</li><li>the handling of subsyllabic morphemes (the model here is Mandarin <i>-r</i>, represented by <i>ér</i>)
</li><li>the organization of dictionaries (in fact, the graphic at the top of the page shows part of the radical index for a Chinese dictionary, organized by stroke count)  
</li><li>the psychological effects.  
</li></ul>

<p>The <b>radicals</b> named are all also Chinese radicals.  The <b>phonetics</b> are not, of course, since the phonetics in hanzi refer to the sounds of Chinese words, not English ones.  But I tried to pick phonetics which would also be phonetics in Chinese (e.g. <i>sun, king, wing, tree, one, east, field, bill</i>).

</p><p>There are differences, too.  For instance, I haven't made any attempt to make my yingzi look like hanzi.  

</p><p>The phonetic sets of Chinese are not exactly based on rhymes.  Karlgren explains that the hanzi belonging to one set had homorganic initial consonants (e.g. k, g), the same main vowel, and the same final consonant.  

</p><p>I've also <b>underreported the complexity</b> (and arguably the inefficiency) of the Chinese script in several important ways:

</p><ul>
<li>The phonetic sets in Chinese, though still useful, are two thousand years out of date.  It's as if my yingzi phonetics had to rhyme in Proto-Germanic, not in modern English.  
</li><li>The scribes who devised hanzi often went wild adding radicals, creating multiple characters for what are etymologically the same root.  
</li><li>Four milennia have reduced the pictorial content of the hanzi primitives almost to nil.  What the "pictograms" are pictures of is often evident only to the scholar.  
</li><li>Clear and precise handwriting is by no means a virtue in Chinese; the most admired style, <i>câoshu</i>, is highly simplified, suggesting rather than delineating the characters intended.
</li><li>The People's Republic has simplified many of the traditional hanzi; and this reform has been accepted in Singapore but not in Taiwan or Hong Kong.  It's as if the US had its own versions of a large fraction of English yingzi.
</li></ul>

<p>I also haven't gotten into the many additional complications engendered when hanzi were adopted by Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese; for more on that see 
John DeFrancis's <i>The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy.</i>

</p><p>In some respects, however, yingzi are <b>harder</b> than hanzi.  For instance, English has many more multisyllabic morphemes than Chinese.  Only about 10% of Chinese morphemes are more than one syllable long.  Also, English has borrowed so much that it often has five or six morphemes where Chinese would have just one-- compare <i>wáng</i> vs. <i>king, regal, royal, regicide, Rex</i>, or <i>zì</i> vs. <i>word, verb, logograph, bon mot.</i>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For most of this century, Big Tech has been allowed to operate with little scrutiny or oversight — to disastrous effects, in the form of social media harms, anti competitive practices, and more. Despite recent efforts to rein them in, a small handful of mega companies continue to wield enormous power in our economy and in Washington — and now, Washington is at risk of repeating the mistakes of the past when it comes to artificial intelligence. </p><p>A few weeks ago, I went to DC to start engaging policymakers and be the voice of <a href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/1595232588255309824?s=46&amp;t=t0fy922SkI6eb4WhJHKTSQ">little tech</a> — the emerging tech keeping our economy dynamic. We met with leaders from both parties and White House officials who oversee tech policy, and spoke to them about the importance of open source AI, talent access through immigration, market access through antitrust action, and the elimination of noncompetes.</p><p>While we should listen to what the biggest names from the biggest companies have to say on AI and other areas of tech, we also need to also make room for the thousands of startups that can help ensure the benefits of AI are shared widely and that American leadership in the technology space continues. The founders of these companies have important perspectives on critical issues like open source versus closed source development, national security concerns, threats to innovation, and more.</p><p>I see their value firsthand. The YC community is now made up of 11,000 founders and 5,000 startups from nearly every state in the US. This year, we’ll fund more than 500 companies out of 50,000 applications, and almost all of them are related to AI in some way. We’re determined to help grow the next generation of great companies, as these innovators are critical to pushing the boundaries of what's possible and ensuring the benefits of AI are widely distributed.</p><p>There are many reasons to be optimistic about AI and its ability to improve our lives – from helping us find new ways to tackle climate change to <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2023/oct/high-us-health-care-spending-where-is-it-all-going">cutting costs</a> in healthcare. Unlocking those benefits will require acknowledging that there are big ideas at little companies that need to be given the space to take off. We need smart policy to ensure that happens — and they need to be at the table to be heard. </p><p>This is a once-in-a-generation moment, and ignoring the perspective and interests of startups by writing policy that kills them before they ever have a chance to get off the ground would be one of the most damning mistakes lawmakers can make. </p><p>That’s why we need AI policy that promotes fair, open, and competitive markets. In other words, we need policies that can help little tech thrive. Here’s what we shared with senior government officials: </p><ul><li>First, let’s prioritize open source models and more tailored AI applications to shape the competitive landscape and create real opportunities for startups. Open source AI models allow for greater transparency, collaboration, and innovation by making the underlying code publicly accessible and modifiable. In contrast, closed source models, often favored by large tech companies, can limit competition and concentrate power. But how open should we be? <p>While there are certainly safety concerns about open source technology getting into the hands of bad actors, those concerns have so far proven to be overblown. It would be far more dangerous for lawmakers to cave to Big Tech <a href="https://time.com/6972134/ai-lobbying-tech-policy-surge/">lobbying</a> and craft policy that closes off AI development. Doing so would put more power in fewer hands, and stunt innovation by clipping the wings on a dazzling array of world-changing startups before they have a chance to compete.</p></li><li>Second, we need to <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/content/files/2024/06/RemedyFest-Final-Report.pdf">prioritize forceful remedies to foster competition</a> in the market and ensure new entrants can make inroads without fear of retaliation. We need decisive action to compel more interoperability by the largest firms and curb self-preferencing so we restore competition and innovation, similar to measures called for in the American Innovation and Choice Online Act that Big Tech lobbying <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-20/big-tech-divided-and-conquered-to-block-key-bipartisan-bills">killed</a> at the eleventh hour in 2021. At the end of the day, we need an open and neutral app ecosystem where consumers and developers can maintain a direct relationship. <br></li><li>And finally, we need more steps like the FTC’s recent move to ban all employee noncompetes (no carve outs, no limitations, no exceptions). That kind of common sense policy helps founders build strong, new companies and disrupt the status quo.</li></ul><p>This country is built on the idea of rugged individualism, ingenuity, and grit. It’s also built on the idea of equal opportunity. As we approach a new age of innovation, where the rules of the road are being written as we speak, we need to give little tech a chance to succeed. All of us will benefit as a result.</p></div></div>]]></description>

 <p>Here’s a <a href="https://twitter.com/finmoorhouse/status/1744059290120245347">puzzle</a>:</p>
<p>Imagine you begin a journey in Seattle WA, facing exactly due east. Then start traveling forward, in a straight line along the Earth’s surface.</p>
<p>You will travel across North America, and onto the Atlantic Ocean. Eventually, you will hit another country.</p>
<p>The question is: <em>what is the first country you hit?</em></p>
<p>The image below shows your starting direction. The rest of this post discusses the answer, so here’s your opportunity to make a guess of your own.</p>

<details><summary>Click me to <strong>reveal the answer</strong></summary><hr><strong>Australia</strong>. After pointing due east, and traveling continually forward in a straight line across the Earth’s surface, the next country you hit after you leave North America is Australia.
<p>And here is the path you take (<a href="https://images.finmoorhouse.com/writing/go-east/mercator-path.png">high res version</a>)<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>:</p>

<p>Forget about the Earth for a second, and just imagine you’re standing on a big sphere.</p>
<p>Point in <em>any</em> direction, and begin walking forward along the surface of the sphere, without changing direction. This, I think, is the fairest interpretation of ‘straight line’.</p>
<p>Of course, you’ll loop round and return to where you started.</p>
<figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://finmoorhouse.com/img/s48nwx1oeU-800.avif 800w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/s48nwx1oeU-1600.avif 1600w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/s48nwx1oeU-2000.avif 2000w" sizes="100vw"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://finmoorhouse.com/img/s48nwx1oeU-800.jpeg 800w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/s48nwx1oeU-1600.jpeg 1600w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/s48nwx1oeU-2000.jpeg 2000w" sizes="100vw"><img alt="The most obvious interpretation of 'straight line'" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://finmoorhouse.com/img/s48nwx1oeU-800.jpeg" width="2000" height="1734"></picture><figcaption>The most obvious interpretation of 'straight line'</figcaption></figure>
<p>Notice also, just intuitively, how you’ll have walked the full circumference of the sphere: a ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle">great circle</a>’.</p>
<p>In order to trace out a smaller circle than that, you’d need to be constantly veering left or right.</p>
<p>In the original puzzle, you might have been imagining traveling a line of constant latitude — that is, <em>always</em> heading east.</p>
<p>But that is <em>not</em> a great circle, and so not a straight line: you’d need to be constantly turning left to maintain that path. Travelling laterally means changing direction with respect to the Earth’s surface.</p>
<figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://finmoorhouse.com/img/5rb5Vvf6Nn-800.avif 800w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/5rb5Vvf6Nn-1600.avif 1600w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/5rb5Vvf6Nn-2000.avif 2000w" sizes="100vw"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://finmoorhouse.com/img/5rb5Vvf6Nn-800.jpeg 800w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/5rb5Vvf6Nn-1600.jpeg 1600w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/5rb5Vvf6Nn-2000.jpeg 2000w" sizes="100vw"><img alt="A line of constant latitude" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://finmoorhouse.com/img/5rb5Vvf6Nn-800.jpeg" width="2000" height="1508"></picture><figcaption>A line of constant latitude</figcaption></figure>
<p>To give an extreme example: imagine driving in a 10 meter radius around the North Pole. In order to always be traveling east — maintaining the same latitude — you’d need to be steering left the whole time.</p>
<p>Here’s a better perspective: looking at Seattle centered on a globe, any straight line from Seattle will look like a straight line to you.</p>
<p>So with north pointing directly up, the path you take is a straight line directly to the right.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://finmoorhouse.com/img/a1jTgLDGbb-800.avif 800w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/a1jTgLDGbb-1600.avif 1600w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/a1jTgLDGbb-2000.avif 2000w" sizes="100vw"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://finmoorhouse.com/img/a1jTgLDGbb-800.jpeg 800w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/a1jTgLDGbb-1600.jpeg 1600w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/a1jTgLDGbb-2000.jpeg 2000w" sizes="100vw"><img alt="The starting point" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://finmoorhouse.com/img/a1jTgLDGbb-800.jpeg" width="2000" height="1734"></picture></p>
<p>Being a great circle, exactly half of the path you travel is in the Northern Hemisphere, and half in the Southern Hemisphere. It swoops under Africa to arrive at Australia somewhere near Perth<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://finmoorhouse.com/img/Wqmul5ksaK-800.avif 800w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/Wqmul5ksaK-1600.avif 1600w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/Wqmul5ksaK-2000.avif 2000w" sizes="100vw"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://finmoorhouse.com/img/Wqmul5ksaK-800.jpeg 800w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/Wqmul5ksaK-1600.jpeg 1600w, https://finmoorhouse.com/img/Wqmul5ksaK-2000.jpeg 2000w" sizes="100vw"><img alt="Arriving at Australia" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://finmoorhouse.com/img/Wqmul5ksaK-800.jpeg" width="2000" height="1734"></picture></p>
<p>One way to see this would be to pin a string to Seattle on a globe, and stretch it taut over the globe. Every path from Seattle to wherever you stretch the string is a geodesic; being the shortest line on the surface of the globe to that point. Now stretch the string so that it emerges from Seattle going east: you’ll see it avoids land until Australia.</p>
<p>Of course, part of the trickiness here is that straight lines on the Earth are not straight lines on most 2D projections of the Earth (maps), and vice-versa.</p>
<p>That’s why the shortest flight path between two cities often looks unnecessarily curved on a map, such as the map you see on an airplane.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://finmoorhouse.com/img/kFAOw8rbHI-800.avif 800w" sizes="100vw"><img alt="A flight path, orthographic projection" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://finmoorhouse.com/img/kFAOw8rbHI-800.jpeg" width="800" height="485"></picture></p>

<p>But there are some exceptions. Any straight line on a ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomonic_projection">gnomonic projection</a>’ (pictured) is an arc of a great circle (straight line) on a sphere. <a href="https://images.finmoorhouse.com/writing/go-east/gnomonic.png">Here’s a link</a> to a full-res version of the image below.</p>

<p>But how natural to think a straight line on a more familiar map is a straight line on the surface of the Earth! And so, how natural to answer “France” over “Australia”.</p>
<p>I love this puzzle. Great puzzles are crafted to evoke a flash of insight, after which the answer is both clear and surprising compared to the intuitive answer. This one fits the bill. Poor puzzles feel arbitrary or like cheap tricks; they are to good puzzles as Christmas cracker puns are to good jokes.</p>
<p>I first saw it on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@marcbreathes?lang=en">Marc Ordower’s excellent TikTok page</a>, of all places. Check it out.</p>
<h3 id="appendix%3A-geodesics" tabindex="-1"><a href="#appendix%3A-geodesics">Appendix: geodesics</a></h3>
<p>To be pedantic, by ‘straight line’ here I really mean ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic">geodesic</a>’ — the generalisation of ‘straight line’ for curved surfaces and space as well as ‘flat’, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space">Euclidian</a> spaces.</p>
<p>A geodesic is just the shortest path between two points in a surface. If you’re placed on a surface and continually walk “forward”, by definition <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic#/media/File:Insect_on_a_torus_tracing_out_a_non-trivial_geodesic.gif">you will trace out a geodesic</a>.</p>
<p>Some people replying to my <a href="https://twitter.com/finmoorhouse/status/1744059290120245347">original tweet</a> pointed out that a straight line from the original point and direction would take you into space. This is true if we’re talking about a straight line in <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">E</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{E}^3</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (3D Euclidian space). But in the original question, I say “start traveling forward, in a straight line <strong>along the Earth’s surface</strong>”. So I think it’s clear we’re talking about a straight line along a <em>surface</em>, which is not the same as 3D space. We’re talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesics_on_an_ellipsoid">geodesics on a sphere</a>.</p>
<p>But I admit that “straight line” is not exactly well-defined on curved surfaces. I’m saying “geodesic = straight line”, but someone pointed out to me a different interpretation: “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry)">straight line</a>” <em>is</em> well-defined for Euclidian spaces, including the Euclidian plane (<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">E</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{E}^2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>). So we can say a geodesic (or any other path) is straight <em>just</em> when the <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/294650/when-are-geodesics-straight-lines">associated projective connection is flat</a>, in our case when the projection of the line on the globe onto <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">E</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{E}^2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> — that is, a 2D map — is straight. And that would mean that whether a path across Earth counts as ‘straight’ depends on the projection, and on popular projections (such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection">Mercator projection</a>), lateral paths <em>would</em> count, despite being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darboux_frame#Geodesic_curvature,_normal_curvature,_and_relative_torsion">intrinsically curved</a>.</p>
<p>So maybe half a point for “France” if that’s what went through your head. Still I think “just go straight forward and don’t change direction” is the more natural reading.</p>

We couldn’t be more excited about the direction of this research!</p> <p>Yet despite its potential so far, we weren’t completely satisfied with the first version of Mamba…</p> <h3 id="problem-1-understanding">Problem 1 (Understanding)</h3> <p>From a conceptual standpoint, one of the reasons we found SSMs so fascinating is how they just feel <em>fundamental</em>. One way this is exemplified is how they have rich ties to many major paradigms of sequence models. As developed in our earlier works on structured SSMs <d-cite key="gu2021combining"></d-cite><d-cite key="gu2023thesis"></d-cite>, they seem to capture the essence of continuous, convolutional, and recurrent sequence models – all wrapped up in a simple and elegant model.</p> <p>But of course, aside from these, there’s another major sequence model paradigm: variants of the ubiquitous <strong>attention</strong> mechanism<d-cite key="bahdanau2015neural"></d-cite><d-cite key="vaswani2017attention"></d-cite>. SSMs always felt somewhat disjoint from attention, and we’ve tried for a while to understand their relationship better.</p> <blockquote> <p>Question 1: <strong>What are the conceptual connections between state space models and attention?</strong> Can we combine them?</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="problem-2-efficiency">Problem 2 (Efficiency)</h3> <p>From a computational standpoint, despite the work that went into making Mamba fast (in particular, its hardware-aware selective scan implementation) it’s still much less hardware-efficient than mechanisms such as attention. The missing piece is that modern accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs are <em>highly</em> specialized for matrix multiplications. While this isn’t a problem for inference, which is bottlenecked by somewhat different considerations, this can be a big deal during training time.</p> <blockquote> <p>Question 2: <strong>Can we speed up the training of Mamba models by recasting them as matrix multiplications?</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>These are the main questions that Mamba-2 – in particular, its new state space model variant – tries to address.</p> <h2 id="the-ssd-model">The SSD Model</h2> <p>The main point of the Mamba-2 paper is what we call <strong>structured state space duality</strong> (SSD), which refers to several things:</p> <ol> <li>The <strong>SSD model</strong> refers to a specific standalone layer, like attention or an SSM, that can be incorporated into deep neural networks</li> <li>The <strong>SSD framework</strong> is a general framework for reasoning about this model (and many more theoretical connections)</li> <li>The <strong>SSD algorithm</strong> is an algorithm for computing SSD layers much more efficiently than previous SSMs</li> </ol> <p>The main SSD model or “state space dual model” itself really isn’t so complicated! In this first part of a series of blog posts, we’ll provide a self-contained description of the SSD layer (and Mamba-2) in isolation and how it compares to related models, particularly Mamba-1.</p> <p>In the next parts of this series, we’ll describe the general framework and theoretical connections, which aren’t necessary to actually use Mamba-2.</p> <h3 id="the-linear-ssm-mode">The Linear (SSM) Mode</h3> <p>SSD starts from the same set of equations as Mamba:</p> \[\begin{aligned} h_{t} &amp;= A_t h_{t-1} + B_t x_t \\ y_t &amp;= C_t^{\top} y_t \end{aligned}\] <p>\begin{equation} \label{eq:ssm} (\text{Selective state space model (SSM)}) \end{equation}</p> <p>To recap, a <strong>structured state space model (SSM)</strong> <d-cite key="gu2022efficiently"></d-cite><d-cite key="gu2023thesis"></d-cite> defines a map from $x \in \mathbb{R}^\mathtt{T} \to y \in \mathbb{R}^\mathtt{T}$. Think of $x_t$ and $y_t$ as being scalars, and the hidden state $h_t$ as an $\mathtt{N}$-dimensional vector, where $\mathtt{N}$ is an independent hyperparameter called the <em>state size, state dimension, or state expansion factor</em>.</p> <p>A <em>selective</em> state space model allows the $(A, B, C)$ SSM parameters to vary across time <d-cite key="gu2023mamba"></d-cite>. We’ll think of them as tensors with shapes $A \in \mathbb{R}^\mathtt{(T, N, N)}$, $B \in \mathbb{R}^\mathtt{(T, N)}$, and $C \in \mathbb{R}^\mathtt{(T, N)}$ respectively.<d-footnote>As with Mamba-1, we take everything over the reals $\mathbb{R}$, although complex variants as with other structured SSMs like the S4 lineage <d-cite key="gu2022efficiently"></d-cite> are also possible.</d-footnote></p> <p>Structured SSMs require $A$ to have structure to be efficiently computable, such as the most commonly used diagonal structure <d-cite key="gu2022parameterization"></d-cite><d-cite key="gupta2022diagonal"></d-cite><d-cite key="smith2023s5"></d-cite><d-cite key="gupta2022simplifying"></d-cite>. In this case $A$ has shape $\mathtt{(T, N)}$ where only the diagonal elements of the $\mathtt{N} \times \mathtt{N}$ matrices are stored.</p> <h4 id="ssd-scalar-structured-ssm">SSD: Scalar Structured SSM</h4> <p>The original Mamba (or more precisely its core “S6” layer) is exactly a selective SSM with diagonal structure.</p> <p><strong>The SSD layer of Mamba-2 makes only one small modification</strong>: it restricts the diagonal $A$ even further to a <em>scalar times identity</em> structure; in other words the diagonal elements of $A$ must all be the same value. In this case $A$ can be represented with shape just $\mathtt{(T)}$ and one can also identify $A_t$ as just a scalar (and so we’ll sometimes denote it $a_t$).</p> <h4 id="multihead-ssms">Multihead SSMs</h4> <p>Equation \eqref{eq:ssm} is defined only for a single dimensional input $x \in \mathbb{R}^\mathtt{T}$. If $X \in \mathbb{R}^\mathtt{(T, P)}$ has $\mathtt{P}$ separate channels, we can use the same dynamics (i.e. the same SSM $(A, B, C)$) independently for each channel. This can be interpreted as a <em>single head</em> of the SSM model.</p> <p>Here, we think of $X$ as a tensor of shape $\mathtt{(T, P)}$ where $\mathtt{T}$ is the sequence (time) dimension and $\mathtt{P}$ is the “head dimension”.<d-footnote>Normally there's an additional batch dimension $\mathtt{B}$ when implementing these models, which we'll ignore throughout this presentation.</d-footnote></p> <p>Multiple heads can be constructed completely independently; for the remainder of this post, we assume that we’re working with a single head. Note that these heads are exactly analogous to how heads in multi-head attention models work, and in Mamba-2 we also choose similar dimensions as modern Transformers, e.g. $\mathtt{P} = 64$ or $\mathtt{P}=128$. (To scale to larger model widths $\mathtt{D} = \mathtt{d\_model}$, we keep this fixed and increase the number of independent heads.)</p> <p>We can notate the general (selective) state space model as \begin{equation} \label{eq:ssm-transformation} Y^\mathtt{(T,P)} = \mathsf{SSM}(A^\mathtt{(T,…)}, B^\mathtt{(T,N)}, C^\mathtt{(T,N)})(X^\mathtt{(T,P)}) \end{equation}</p> <p>Some axes of variation include</p> <ol> <li>The structure on $A$, which affects its parameter shape, e.g. <code>... = (N)</code> for diagonal SSMs, or <code>... = ()</code> for scalar SSMs (i.e. SSD)</li> <li>The state dimension $\mathtt{N}$ (i.e. <code>d_state</code>)</li> <li>The head dimension $\mathtt{P}$ (i.e. <code>d_head</code>)</li> </ol> <p>There are other axes of variation of structured SSMs (e.g. time-invariance vs. selectivity, SISO vs. MIMO<d-cite key="smith2023s5"></d-cite>, real vs. complex, etc.), but we’re highlighting these so that we can contrast Mamba-2 to Mamba-1 in just a second…</p> <h3 id="the-quadratic-attention-mode">The Quadratic (Attention) Mode</h3> <p>But first, let’s switch tacks and forget about state space models for a moment. Given the same tensors above with the same shapes $(A^\mathtt{(T)}, B^\mathtt{(T, N)}, C^\mathtt{(T, N)})$, let’s define a different object.</p> <p>First, we’ll define the following matrix (don’t worry, we’ll explain more and give it a name in Part II of this series!)</p> \[L = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; \\ a_1 &amp; 1 &amp; \\ a_2a_1 &amp; a_2 &amp; 1 \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots \\ a_{\mathtt{T}-1}\dots a_1 &amp; a_{\mathtt{T}-1}\dots a_2 &amp; \dots &amp; a_{\mathtt{T}-1} &amp; 1 \\ \end{bmatrix} .\] <p>Then, let’s define the following matrix</p> <p>\begin{equation} \label{eq:ssd-attention} M = L \circ C B^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathtt{(T,T)}} \end{equation}</p> <p>Finally, $M$ encodes a <em>sequence transformation</em> $x \in \mathbb{R}^\mathtt{T} \to y \in \mathbb{R}^\mathtt{T}$ mapping a 1D input to a 1D output—just as in equation \eqref{eq:ssm}—through basic matrix multiplication $y = Mx$.</p> <p>What’s special about this? Well, you may notice that it looks very similar to an attention computation. In fact, if all $a_t = 1$, then $L$ is simply the lower-triangular <em>causal mask</em> and \ref{eq:ssd-attention} is exactly <strong>causal linear attention</strong> <d-cite key="katharopoulos2020transformers"></d-cite>:</p> \[Y = (L \circ Q K^\top) V\] <p>This is exactly the same as equation \eqref{eq:ssd-attention} if we rename $(C, B, X) \mapsto (Q, K, V)$!</p> <h2 id="state-space-duality">State Space Duality</h2> <p>The so-called “duality” refers to the fact that the two models defined in equations \eqref{eq:ssm} (for the scalar-identity structured $A_t$ case) and \eqref{eq:ssd-attention} are actually <em>exactly the same model</em>, which we can view as a particular function</p> \[(A^\mathtt{(T)}, B^\mathtt{(T, N)}, C^\mathtt{(T, N)}, X^\mathtt{(T, P)}) \mapsto Y^\mathtt{(T, P)}\] <p>In the general <em>SSD Framework</em> (Part II of this series), we’ll show this equivalence in two completely different ways, both of which are actually much more general and each quite illuminating.</p> <p>If you take our word for it, though, then SSD is relatively simple to contrast in relation to either SSMs or attention.</p> <h3 id="ssd-vs-state-space-models">SSD vs. State Space Models</h3> <p>Compared to previous SSMs, SSD is pretty much the same as the core layer of Mamba but with even more structure on the recurrent $A$ matrices.</p> <ol> <li>Mamba-1 (S6) uses diagonal structure on $A$, while Mamba-2 (SSD) uses scalar-times-identity structure on $A$.</li> <li>Mamba-1 has a head dimension of $\mathtt{P}=1$ (i.e. all channels are completely independently controlled by separate SSMs), while Mamba-2 uses a head dimension of $\mathtt{P}&gt;1$ (something like $\mathtt{P}=64$ by default).</li> </ol> <p>In particular, this can be viewed as weight-tied in two ways:</p> <ul> <li>By restricting the diagonal structure of $A$ to scalar-times-identity, the recurrence dynamics are shared across all $\mathtt{N}$ elements of the state space.</li> <li>These dynamics are also shared across all $\mathtt{P}$ channels of a given head.</li> </ul> <p>In other words, a single SSM head has total state size $\mathtt{P} \times \mathtt{N}$, which are each governed by separate scalar recurrences in Mamba-1 but are controlled by a single shared recurrence in Mamba-2.</p> <p>Why make these restrictions? The main motivation is efficiency: these changes are necessary to be able to view the model in its [<a href="#the-quadratic-attention-mode">dual attention form</a>], which allows matrix multiplications to be used.</p> <blockquote> <h4 id="the-bottom-line-mamba-1-vs-mamba-2">The Bottom Line: Mamba-1 vs. Mamba-2</h4> <p>Compared to Mamba-1, Mamba-2 allows <strong>much larger state dimensions</strong> (from <code>N=16</code> in Mamba-1 to <code>N=64</code> to <code>N=256</code> or even higher in Mamba-2) while simultaneously being <strong>much faster during training</strong>.</p> </blockquote> <p>But can this hurt us? There’s some intuition to believe that it shouldn’t. One of the main reasons for the selectivity (e.g. $A$ that depends on the input $X$) introduced in Mamba is to let the SSM be able to control whether to remember or ignore particular pieces of information; for example, if a filler “um” is encountered in a text transcript. But if such information should be ignored, then the entire state can ignore it together, and so it should be okay if the state’s dynamics are shared across all features.</p> <p>Empirically, we haven’t found evidence that the restricted expressivity of Mamba-2 might hurt, but the jury’s still out! From one perspective, Mamba-2 isn’t <em>strictly</em> better than Mamba-1: while it’s a dramatic improvement from a <em>training</em> perspective, Mamba-1 might be better from a pure <em>inference</em> perspective. Since inference speed of SSMs is entirely governed by the state dimension, if one wants to maximize performance for a target inference efficiency (i.e. for a particular state size $\mathtt{N}$), then the increased expressivity of Mamba-1 might be better. We haven’t fully analyzed the (theoretical or empirical) tradeoffs here, and think this would be a cool direction for the community to dig in more!</p> <h3 id="ssd-vs-attention">SSD vs. Attention</h3> <p>Compared, to standard (self-)attention, SSD also only has two differences:</p> <ol> <li>The softmax normalization is dropped.</li> <li>A separate elementwise mask matrix is applied multiplicatively.</li> </ol> <p>The first difference can be interpreted as what reduces the effective state size of the model from linear to constant, and improves its efficiency from quadratic to linear.</p> <p>The second difference is what distinguishes SSD from standard linear attention. One way to think of the mask is as <strong>input-dependent relative positional encodings</strong>. Because of the mask $L$ in \eqref{eq:ssd-attention}, the standard attention score $Q_i K_j$ is attenuated by a weight $a_{i:j}^\times = a_i \cdots a_{j+1}$ which can be interpreted as a “discount factor” based on how far apart the positions $i$ and $j$ are.<d-footnote>This interpretation was concurrently espoused by Tobias Katsch's [GateLoop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01927) paper<d-cite key="katsch2023gateloop"></d-cite></d-footnote> In its attention form, this input-dependent positional mask can be interpreted as the key factor that encodes the “selectivity” of Mamba!</p> <h2 id="best-of-both-worlds">Best of Both Worlds</h2> <p>So why do we care that there are two views of this model? Well, first of all, it’s extremely mathematically interesting, as we’ll cover in <a href="https://tridao.me/blog/2024/mamba2-part2-theory/">Part 2</a>, and we hope will inspire future directions. But there are immediate practical benefits too!</p> <h3 id="efficiency-the-ssm-and-attention-modes">Efficiency: the SSM and Attention Modes</h3> <p>The SSM \eqref{eq:ssm} and attention \eqref{eq:ssd-attention} modes represent two different ways of computing the same function, so let’s contrast them.</p> <p>First, remember that one main reason why SSMs are interesting to begin with is because computing \eqref{eq:ssm} as a recurrence requires maintaining a <em>constant-size state</em> (size $\mathtt{N}$ per channel) and scales <em>linearly in the sequence length</em> $\mathtt{T}$. The downside is that the raw FLOPs don’t reflect actual speed in practice because of hardware considerations…</p> <p>On the other hand, computing this sequence transformation $y = Mx$ through equation \eqref{eq:ssd-attention} takes quadratic time in the sequence length, because we’re materializing this $\mathtt{T} \times \mathtt{T}$ matrix. But it can be fast in practice because it only uses matrix multiplications, which are extremely optimized on GPUs and TPUs.</p> <h3 id="efficiency-the-ssd-mode">Efficiency: the SSD Mode</h3> <p>So if there are two equivalent ways of computing the same model, when should we use one mode or the other? During inference, there’s no trade-off: the SSM mode is designed for fast autoregressive inference. But what about training? Here there’s a tension between FLOPs and hardware efficiency where the attention mode uses more FLOPs, but uses them more efficiently through matrix multiplications.</p> <figure> <picture> <source srcset="https://tridao.me/assets/img/2024-05-31-mamba-2/ssd_algorithm-480.webp 480w,https://tridao.me/assets/img/2024-05-31-mamba-2/ssd_algorithm-800.webp 800w,https://tridao.me/assets/img/2024-05-31-mamba-2/ssd_algorithm-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://tridao.me/assets/img/2024-05-31-mamba-2/ssd_algorithm.png" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>It turns out we can get the best of both worlds by combining the algorithms!

We’re currently in the goldilocks zone of having product market fit with real revenue but also a really flat hierarchy where you can ship fast.</p><p>We want to accelerate product delivery (there’s so much to build!) so we’re looking to bring on high agency and experienced frontend engineers to work on high impact product features / frontend infrastructure. We’re building a small, focused, high performing frontend engineering team that works directly with the CEO leading the product. To help build this great team, we offer incredibly competitive compensation (based on Bay Area bands) and some interesting benefits(<a href="https://www.streak.com/careers#benefits" rel="nofollow">https://www.streak.com/careers#benefits</a>). We want you to do the best work of your career here, so you should expect high autonomy and ownership.</p><p>Lastly, we believe the traditional interview process isn’t well correlated with an engineers’ ability to ship product. Instead, our interview process mimics what it’s actually like to work here. It’s highly asynchronous, favors writing and involves building something useful. We think this will give you a really good insight into our team and company and of course lets us assess if you’ll thrive here.</p></div></td></tr>

If you're familiar or experienced with project management then this is a role you'll excel in, but we're equally open to bringing on entry-level people looking to gain experience --&gt; <a href="https://coda.io/d/_dVweWtFuF-G/_suJlq" rel="nofollow">https://coda.io/d/_dVweWtFuF-G/_suJlq</a></p><p>2. [Targeting Mid-level] A role suitable for 'hackers' who enjoy working with mixtures of technologies on constant short and medium term (few weeks to a few months) projects for more custom labeling projects. In the last few weeks this has involved things like overlaying text over screen recordings with ffmpeg, SQL + Python scripts to clean and prepare data for annotation, building a Django dashboard that collates information from multiple sources, and so on. Almost all greenfield, requires coordinating with clients to interpret the project requirements, estimating the complexity and eventually choosing the right tools for the job and executing on the work. A truly 'whiteboard to deployment' role where you get to have full ownership. This team is currently just made up of senior devs, so we're largely targeting mid-level devs at the moment to round it out --&gt; <a href="https://coda.io/d/_dVweWtFuF-G/_suZtt" rel="nofollow">https://coda.io/d/_dVweWtFuF-G/_suZtt</a></p><p>3.

Code-writing roles require a strong command of Python fundamentals. We are a fully distributed, remote-first company with an engineering team spread around the world. There is essentially no restriction on where you're located as long as you're able to be present for our core collaboration hours of 8am PST to 1pm PST.</p><p>No recruiting agencies or similar, we're only interested in filling the open full-time roles.</p><p>Please mention me directly or HN when applying to avoid getting caught up in the screening flow.

And we're looking for talented and interested engineers to join us.</p><p>Prospective is a professional toolchain for analyzing and visualizing data on your local machine. It's a graphical tool that runs in a web browser and is able to slice and dice gigabytes of static or realtime data. It's built on the popular OSS framework Perspective <a href="https://github.com/finos/perspective">https://github.com/finos/perspective</a> . Prospective runs as WebAssembly in modern browsers, so it's fast, portable, and memory-efficient. It has its own in-memory data store, but can also plug into any database or streaming platform with a straightforward adapter API. Prospective integrates with existing data tools like Python and Jupyter, and all the dashboards created can be shared to ease collaboration. Our goal is to expand beyond financial services and become the standard toolchain for anyone whose job is to make sense and find patterns in large datasets.</p><p>Prospective offers a great opportunity to dig into complex software. On any given day we might be optimizing how the database executes queries in C++, implementing API features in Rust, writing new language bindings for our API, speeding up our Bazel build process, or implementing new charting or query features in our graphical UI. Prospective is engineered to be fast and stable. We write good tests, and once a bug is fixed it stays fixed.</p><p>Our team has a culture of mentorship and collaboration, and we work with each other knowing that every team member is always either teaching or learning. We pair-program regularly as a way to share our thinking and get feedback on our solutions. We hold each other to a high quality bar for performance and aesthetics, a constraint that we think creates a healthy environment for creative problem-solving.
Every day has a brief "stand up" in the morning and a "stand down" in the afternoon to share what we've learned and what we're stuck on. Every Friday afternoon we demo what we're building for each other, which we call "dogfooding". And we talk regularly to our users, both paid and open-source, to create product feedback loops to understand where the rough edges are and what folks find extremely valuable.</p><p>We'd love to chat with you if you have experience in WebAssembly, Python native extensions, C++, Rust or Jupyter.
But regardless of your experience, we're very intentionally looking for people who are interested, motivated, and passionate about deeply learning WebAssembly and pushing the boundaries of what a browser can do. We believe smart, passionate people will channel that energy into learning how the tech stack works; and we believe that aligning people's work with their interests correlates with long term business success.
We're currently looking for two additional engineers to join our five-person team. We're open to more-junior and more-senior engineers, and are committed to making a competitive offer based on experience and skill level.</p><p>Contact andrew@prospective.dev</p></div></td></tr>

What sort of problems do I like?</p><p>I worked with a Stuttgart based auto manufacturer to identify and predict when a part they had would fail. It turns out the answer will be familiar to west coast Canadians - The leaky condo crisis.</p><p>I worked with a well known cloud vendor to predict server failiures. Built a few test approaches (DL, anomoly detection, clustering, etc) and went with a simple efficient one that worked well. They got several minutes warning to load shift before a server failed.</p><p>A Taxi company in latam hired me to built a fleet maintenance system. It predicted and scheduled preventative maintenance to reduce wear and tear and avoid breakdowns. We also identified the leading cause of wear - leadfoot drivers. So we built a system that would identify aggressive driving.</p><p>Another example was a speculative sports highlights annotation system I built with a consultancy. It ingested sports video and identified predetermined highlights in baseball - diving catches in our case.</p><p>Who shouldn't contact me.</p><p>If your market is Ads or gambling I'm not interested. Sure there's lot of money, but I'd rather sleep at night.

Particulalry useful for potentially starving cancers.</p><p>Low compute AI and connecting them to interpretable and defensible knowledge bases.

</code></pre><p>
SWE interested in all things distributed. I was most recently a Senior SRE at a cybersecurity startup in the US. 
I work at the intersection of Operations, R&amp;D, and SWE so my work involves everything from arm-twisting [major cloud provider] into launching new (previously unavailable) Redis instances overnight to debugging unknown edge cases in production code. Working at a startup I’ve learnt to move fast while NOT breaking things(and quickly fixing things I do end up breaking!), and have worn various hats such as Cloud Security Engineer, SWE, SRE etc as the business evolved. I handled customers directly and owned parts of engineering and infrastructure. Experienced in backend, infrastructure engineering and cloud operations. 
I'm actively looking for my next adventure(mid to senior engineering roles), if this sounds like a good fit please don't hesitate to reach out!</p></div></td></tr>

I am a full stack developer with preference for backend work nearing a decade of professional experience. I've built many greenfield projects and maintained legacy systems. Very comfortable up and down the stack. I've built myself GIS applications, video transcoding pipelines, automated linear TV channels, video streaming applications, license plate readers, offline-first web applications, web scrapers, a Foursquare-like and Netflix-like applications and more. I've personally built toys with computer vision, ML and AI tools as well but I am interested in more work one day around drones and GIS but I'm open for any challenge.</p><p>Because I had to explain to others recently, I am a US citizen, my past work took me to the south Pacific and then covid and my wife's visa processing took years so I just returned to the States. I had quite the experience on various projects through my personal consulting adventures and working for an ISP while I was there.</p></div></td></tr>

Honestly, anything to give me a foothold in IT would be much appreciated.</p><p>Resume: <a href="https://implicit.computer/resume" rel="nofollow">https://implicit.computer/resume</a></p><p>Email: keaton [at] alloquor [dot] net</p></div></td></tr>

I am an experienced engineering leader, product creator, and full stack engineer.  I have over a decade of broad experience with technologies, industries, and scales of operation, having founded multiple startups in the AI and Ad-Tech industries (including Augur which went through Techstars Boulder 2013 and was later acquired), worked at enterprises as notable as Microsoft and Salesforce, won over 15 hackathons, and regularly built new products for fun or freelance.  My engineering often involves machine learning, web scraping, and integrating many disparate systems.  Some of my more interesting personal projects include the OpenAI GPT3 .Net SDK, the AllThePeople.net social media data mining system, and a teleprompter for Google Glass.  Additionally, I am experienced at presenting at conferences and managing events in both professional and entertainment contexts.  I am based in San Francisco but value location flexibility.</p><p>A few years ago I took a break from the tech industry to start a 450-seat San Francisco live performance venue in the midst of a pandemic, which is now a thriving local business hosting sold-out events most days of the week.  Over the past year or so I've founded a couple AI startups (<a href="https://doppler.bot/" rel="nofollow">https://doppler.bot</a> and <a href="https://mindprint.ai/" rel="nofollow">https://mindprint.ai</a>) and numerous other projects (from domain name brainstorming to a productivity tool functionally identical to MS's recently announced recall feature), some of which are built on top of OpenAI and some of which are based on open source models.  At this point it's becoming clear the recent startups I founded are probably not going mainstream, so I'm exploring what might be next for me career-wise.</p><p>I would love for my next role to utilize my top-tier engineering skills, my customer-focused product expertise, and my experience managing and growing an organization.  I am open to technical co-founder roles, CTO positions, as well as entrepreneur-in-residence or new product-building opportunities within organizations of all sizes.</p><p>More info about me and my projects here: <a href="https://rogerpincombe.com/" rel="nofollow">https://rogerpincombe.com</a></p></div></td></tr>

I have always worked as a full-stack developer with clients seeing all of my work in the open, so I'm not a "cost by" sort of employee. I'm excited to develop my skills further, and I'm looking forward to be mentored by those with a lot more experience.</p></div></td></tr>

   Salary: ~USD140k / year</code></pre><p>
I'm a senior full-stack developer with an aspiration for team/product lead or CTO-like position. For ~7 years I was co-founder and CTO of an ed-tech company called: amy.app . My co-founder and I scaled the company to about 25 employees. Before that I gained a PhD in Human Robot Interaction in NZ. Currently I'm exploring how LLMs, in particular vision, can be used to automate back office jobs. I'm very product/customer focused and pragmatic. I like to move super fast.
My dream environment is an early-stage/full-remote startup.</p><p>PS: I have a family, that means the main compensation via shares isn't an option for me. PPS: to demonstrate my speed: Here is an LLM project I fully(!) developed within 48h. It even got some traction on HN: <a href="https://www.line-items.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.line-items.com/</a></p></div></td></tr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>I’ll get to the good and bad news of the week, but first I want to note the big story - Donald Trump’s conviction by a jury in New York - and a little story with big implications - the Federal Bureau of Investigation raiding a corporate landlord in cahoots with a nation-wide rent-fixing cartel that affects up to 16 million apartments.</p><p>Ok, so the big political economy news of the week was obviously Donald Trump’s conviction on the charge of falsifying business records, even as he is on track to become the Republican Presidential nominee. I don’t have anything to add here that you can’t access in any ordinary political trade magazine or news program, but it’s important to flag it since the election will have significant consequences on market power questions. In the round-up below, you’ll notice increase news about what Trump is saying he’ll do on monopoly issues.</p><p><span>In a far less-noticed law enforcement action, the FBI this week conducted a dawn raid of corporate landlord giant Cortland Management over what’s called algorithmic price-fixing. This corporate real estate management firm, based in Atlanta, rents out 85,000 units across thirteen states. But Cortland is allegedly part of a much bigger conspiracy orchestrated by a software and consulting firm named RealPage to increase rents nationwide by coordinating landlord pricing decisions and holding apartments off the market. How much bigger? Well, there’s a </span><a href="https://6398037.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/6398037/0001%20-%202023-01-23%20Complaint.pdf" rel="">civil antitrust action</a><span> in Tennessee that’s been going on since 2023, where the argument is that RealPage has been working with at least 21 large landlords and institutional investors, encompassing 70% of multi-family apartment buildings and 16 million units nationwide, to systematically push up rents. And RealPage isn’t just some software company distorting rental markets, it’s also owned by Thoma Bravo, one of the biggest private equity firms in the U.S. So yeah, this scandal matters. (RealPage is also </span><a href="https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/meet-realpages-revolving-door-lobbyists/" rel="">lobbying</a><span> up, which politically connected firms do…)</span></p><p>How does the cartel allegedly work? Well large corporate landlords, who would normally compete with one another for tenants via price or quality, have since 2016 stopped doing so. Instead, they all share “detailed real-time data regarding pricing, inventory, occupancy rates, and unit types that are or will be coming available to rent” every day with one another through RealPage’s revenue management system, which in turn sends back recommendations on pricing.</p><p>Landlords adopt RealPage recommendations on pricing 80-90% of the time, which explicitly drives up revenue by holding apartments off the market. As the architect of RealPage once explained, “[i]f you have idiots undervaluing, it costs the whole system.” It’s not just an information-sharing and price recommendation engine. RealPage has ‘pricing advisors’ that monitor landlords and encourage them to accept suggested pricing, it works to get employees at landlord companies fired who try to move rents lower, and it even threatens to drop clients who don’t accept its high price recommendations. This one’s a very clear conspiracy. Allegedly.</p><p><span>Cortland is located in Atlanta, where 81% of multifamily rental unit prices are </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.tnmd.94141/gov.uscourts.tnmd.94141.291.0.pdf" rel="">set</a><span> via software. And rent in that city has exploded, up 80% since 2016. What’s odd about this price increase is that vacancy rates have been inching up, and when there’s more supply, prices should come down. But they aren’t. What seems to have happened in the period between 2015-2017 is that a bunch of landlords started using RealPage pricing recommendations. Then in 2017, RealPage </span><a href="https://www.realpage.com/news/realpage-to-acquire-lease-rent-options/" rel="">bought</a><span> its main rival, Lease Rent Option, giving it perfect information into the supply and demand for apartment rentals.

        <h2><i>The British Industrial Revolution in Global Perspective</i>, by Robert Allen</h2>
      
      <p>Imagine you could go back in time to the ancient world to jump-start the Industrial Revolution. You carry with you plans for a steam engine, and you present them to the emperor, explaining how the machine could be used to drain water out of mines, pump bellows for blast furnaces, turn grindstones and lumber saws, etc.</p>

<p>But to your dismay, the emperor responds: “Your mechanism is no gift to us. It is tremendously complicated; it would take my best master craftsmen years to assemble. It is made of iron, which could be better used for weapons and armor. And even if we built these engines, they would consume enormous amounts of fuel, which we need for smelting, cooking, and heating. All for what? Merely to <em>save labor</em>. Our empire has plenty of labor; I personally own many slaves. Why waste precious iron and fuel in order to lighten the load of a slave? You are a fool!”</p>

<p>We can think of innovation as a kind of product. In the market for innovation there is supply and demand. To explain the Industrial Revolution, economic historians like Joel Mokyr emphasize supply factors: factors that create innovation, such as scientific knowledge and educated craftsmen. But where does <em>demand</em> for innovation come from? What if demand for innovation is low? And how much can demand factors explain industrialization?</p>

<p>Riffing on <a href="http://www.quotecounterquote.com/2011/12/suppose-they-gave-war-and-nobody-came.html" target="_blank">an old anti-war slogan</a>, we can ask: What if they gave an Industrial Revolution and nobody came?</p>

<p>Robert Allen thinks demand factors have been underrated. He makes his case in <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/books/the-british-industrial-revolution-in-global-perspective"><em>The British Industrial Revolution in Global Perspective,</em></a> in which he argues that many major inventions were adopted when and where the prices of various factors made it profitable and a good investment to adopt them, and not before. In particular, he emphasizes high wages, the price of energy, and (to a lesser extent) the cost of capital. When and where labor is expensive, and energy and capital are cheap, then it is a good investment to build machines that consume energy in order to automate labor, and further, it is a good investment to do the R&amp;D needed to invent such machines. But not otherwise.</p>

<p>And, when he’s feeling bold, Allen might push the hypothesis further: to the extent that demand factors explain the adoption of technology, we don’t need other hypotheses, including those about supply factors. We don’t need to suppose that certain cultures are more inventive than others or more receptive to innovation; we don’t need to posit that some societies exhibit <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/books/bourgeois-dignity">bourgeois virtues</a> or possess <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/books/a-culture-of-growth">a culture of growth</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s examine Allen’s argument and see what we can learn from it. First I’ll summarize the core of his argument, then I’ll discuss some responses and criticism and give my own thoughts.</p>

<h2 id="high-wages-and-cheap-energy">High wages and cheap energy</h2>

<p>In the first half of the book, Allen establishes that pre-industrial Britain was indeed a high-wage, cheap-energy economy.</p>

<h3 id="wages">Wages</h3>

<p>Here are workers’ wages in various cities around the world. By the 18th century, wages in London and Amsterdam were more than twice that of other major cities:</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/img/allen-fig-2.1.jpg" target="_blank">

  </a>
  <figcaption>
    Figure 2.1. Laborers’ wages around the world
    
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Nor is it just that prices were higher in those cities. Here are the wages deflated by the cost of a “subsistence basket,” the bare minimum of food, clothing, and other goods needed to live. Workers in Vienna, Delhi, or Beijing were only a little above subsistence; those in Amsterdam or London were ~4x above:</p>

  </a>
  <figcaption>
    Figure 2.3. Subsistence ratio for labourers: income/costs of subsistence basket
    
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There is also qualitative evidence of high wages. Workers in Northwest Europe ate better diets, “in view of the apparent widespread consumption of expensive and highly refined foods like white bread, meat, dairy products and beer. In contrast, workers and peasants in France, Italy, India and China ate a quasi-vegetarian diet of grain, often boiled, with scarcely any animal protein. Diets like these were consumed only by the poorest people in Britain or the Low Countries.” And 18th-century Englishmen bought more consumer goods, including “tropical foodstuffs (tea, sugar, coffee and chocolate), imported Asian manufactures (cotton textiles, silk and Chinese porcelain) and British manufactures (imitations of the Asian imports and a wide range of other items like clothing, books, furniture, clocks, glassware, crockery and metal products).”</p>

<h3 id="energy">Energy</h3>

<p>Here are some comparative energy prices:</p>

  </a>
  <figcaption>
    Figure 4.1. Prices of energy, early 1700s
    
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Note that prices were moderate in London and Amsterdam, but they were extraordinarily low in Newcastle, near the coal mines themselves.</p>

<p>I found Allen’s analysis of energy as a factor in industrialization to be the most persuasive that I have read. Merely gesturing at Britain’s coal deposits isn’t good enough, because steam engines can be run on any fuel that produces fire, including wood and <a href="https://antonhowes.substack.com/p/age-of-invention-the-weight-of-air" target="_blank">peat</a>. Henry Ford, in his youth, is said to have run a portable steam engine to do farm work, and to have fueled it with old fence posts and corn husks. But Allen looks at multiple types of fuel, and compares not just availability but costs.</p>

<h3 id="relative-costs">Relative costs</h3>

<p>Combining these factors, here is the ratio of labor to energy costs in different places:</p>

<p>In short: England, and especially the coal-producing counties, had more economic incentive to mechanize than anywhere else in the world.</p>

<h2 id="case-studies-steam-textiles-iron">Case studies: steam, textiles, iron</h2>

<p>In the second half of the book, Allen takes three central stories of the Industrial Revolution as case studies, and argues that demand factors explain the timing of their adoption.</p>

<h3 id="the-steam-engine">The steam engine</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/the-newcomen-steam-engine">Newcomen steam engine</a> was terribly inefficient with fuel, so it could only be run profitably if fuel was very cheap, and if the work done by the engine was very valuable. This is why the first applications of Newcomen engines were at coal mines themselves, where there were no fuel transportation costs. In fact, you could feed the engine scraps of coal from the mine that were not suitable for sale, making the fuel virtually free. The other reason that these engines were mostly used at mines was that they generated a reciprocal motion, which was good for pumping, but which didn’t translate easily into the rotary motion needed in many industrial applications. (In fact, in some of the earliest applications of steam power to factories, the engine was used to pump water upstream, which then drove a water mill (!): these instances “are usually thought of as steam engines supplementing inadequate water power, but they can also be analyzed as a technique to improve a Newcomen engine by adding to it a water system so that the engine produces smooth, rotary power.”)</p>

<p>Because of these factors, the distribution of Newcomen engines closely follows the distribution of coal fields. “Since most of the coal mines were in Britain, so were most of the engines… Belgium, with the largest coal-mining industry on the continent, was second,” followed by France. “The diffusion pattern of the Newcomen engine was determined by the location of coal mines, and Britain’s lead reflected the size of her coal industry—not superior rationality.” Further: “Non-adoption was not due to ignorance: the Newcomen engine was well known as the wonder technology of its day. It was not difficult to acquire components, nor was it difficult to lure English mechanics abroad to install them. Despite that, it was little used.”</p>

<p>With iterative improvement, steam engines became much more fuel-efficient: early Newcomen engines consumed ~45 pounds of coal per horsepower-hour; the most efficient engines of the late 1800s used less than <em>one</em> pound. And the engines became better adapted to rotary motion. Allen says that this explains the diffusion of steam power to more industries:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… water and wind remained the dominant sources of power until about 1830. It was only between 1830 and 1870 that steam became pre-eminent…. The decisive shift to steam occurred in the middle decades of the nineteenth century after high-pressure compound engines cut costs…. The effect of cheaper power on its spread can be seen in the diffusion of famous technical processes. Van Tunzelmann (1978, pp. 193, 200), for instance, has shown that the power loom and the spinning of high-count yarn with the self-acting mule became cost-effective as power costs dropped in the middle of the nineteenth century.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a general pattern: the first version of a technology is relatively expensive and inefficient, and so it only gets used in one location or for one application where demand is intense. As the technology is iteratively improved, and its cost-benefit ratio decreases, it diffuses to other locations and uses with more moderate demand.</p>

<p>As another example, economics can explain the shift from sail to steam ships:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By 1855, the trade between Britain and ports in France and the Low Countries was steam, and by 1865 steam had displaced sail on cargo voyages to the eastern Mediterranean, a journey of 3,000 miles. By the early 1870s, steam was established on trans-Atlantic routes of 3,000 miles, and the 5,000-mile voyage between Britain and New Orleans shifted to steam in the late 1870s. By the 1880s, steam displaced sail on trade between Britain and Asia. These transitions occurred when the cost of shipping freight by steam dropped below the cost by sail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it explains diffusion patterns outside Britain:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… there was very little steam capacity in France or Germany around 1800. Indeed, it was not until the second third of the nineteenth century that steam capacity expanded sharply, and steam came to play an important role as a power source for industry. The rapid take-up of steam for manufacturing outside of Britain followed immediately upon the use of compounding in rotary steam engines, a change which sharply cut the cost of power.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="cotton-manufacturing">Cotton manufacturing</h3>

<p>The first machines to automate cotton production were not powered by steam, so here energy prices are less relevant. Instead, the relevant factor is the relative cost of capital and labor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The cotton mill of 1836 was so efficient that it could out-compete hand spinning anywhere in the world. By the middle of the nineteenth century, cotton spinning mills were being built even in very low wage economies like India. It was not always like that, however. In the middle of the eighteenth century when machine spinning was in its infancy, it was only profitable where labour was very dear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For instance, a <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/out-of-whole-cloth">spinning jenny</a> with 24 spindles cost 70 times as much as a spinning wheel. They were taken up rapidly in England, but not in India, and not even in France, despite the French government actively promoting them. “Was this bad entrepreneurship or cultural backwardness?” No. Allen calculates the ROI of a jenny and finds:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… the rate of return to buying a jenny was 38 per cent in England, 2.5 per cent in France and –5.2 per cent in India where it was a dead loss…. These differences were due to the differences in wages relative to capital prices. Britain’s high wage economy meant that a 24-spindle jenny cost 134 days of earnings in Britain compared to 311 days earnings in France and even more in India. On the figures, it is no wonder that putting-out merchants found the jenny irresistible in England but unattractive in France or India!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A similar analysis applies to Arkwright’s <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/out-of-whole-cloth">water frame</a> and textile mills. Allen computes the rate of return from an Arkwright-style mill:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Britain, the profit rate was 40 per cent per year, while in France it was only 9 per cent. The English profit rate was excellent. The French return, on the other hand, was unsatisfactory since fixed capital invested in business could earn 15 per cent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Allen concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Profitability considerations are sufficient to explain why the spinning jenny and the water frame were invented in England rather than France or, indeed, most other parts of the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>France adopted textile machinery once it became profitable, in early 1800s. The cost of labor had not risen, nor had the cost of the machines fallen, but the <em>productivity</em> of the machines had increased, which increased their ROI:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… the rate of return shot up to 34 per cent. This was very satisfactory, and the rise explains the shift to machine production in France and Belgium after 1815.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The US, which had high wages, adopted mechanization even earlier, in the late 1700s.</p>

<p>Incidentally, although it isn’t central to (and IMO actually runs somewhat counter to) Allen’s main argument, I have to highlight this fascinating bit about how textile mechanization depended on precision gearing from the watch industry:</p>

<figure data-url="/img/allen-plate-8.6.jpg"><img src="https://rootsofprogress.org/img/allen-plate-8.6.jpg"></figure>

<blockquote>
  <p>The importance of watch-making for the textile industry cannot be overstated. The watch industry was the source of gears—brass gears in particular—and they were the precision parts in the water frame. Power was delivered to the rollers through gears, and gears controlled their speeds. Wyatt and Paul’s patent specification showed gears at the base of the flyer (Plate 8.6). When Arkwright began developing the water frame, he hired John Kay, a clock-maker, and later negotiated with Peter Atherton, a Warrington machine-maker, who supplied him with a smith and a watch-tool-maker. Without watch-makers, the water frame could not have been designed.…</p>

  <p>Inexpensive gears revolutionized the design of machinery. Gears replaced levers and belts (as in the spinning wheel) to control, direct and transmit power. Mills had used gears in this way in the middle ages, but these gears were large, crude and made of wood. The gears of the Industrial Revolution were small, refined and made of brass or iron. ‘Clock work’ was used quite generally to control power in machinery in the nineteenth century, so gearing was the General Purpose Technology that effected the mechanization of industry.…</p>

  <p>When Arkwright built his mills at Cromford, he hired clock-makers. One of his advertisements in the Derby Mercury in 1771 read: ‘Wanted immediately, two Journeymen Clock-Makers, or others that understands Tooth and Pinion well.’</p>

<h3 id="smelting-iron-with-coke">Smelting iron with coke</h3>

<p>Before the 1700s, <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/iron-from-mythical-to-mundane">iron</a> was generally smelted using charcoal as fuel. Coal was not suitable as a smelting fuel because it contains impurities such as sulfur that weakened the iron. Before it can be used for smelting, then, coal has to be purified, basically turned into almost pure carbon. The resulting product is called coke.</p>

<p>Using coke for iron smelting was pioneered in Britain by Abraham Darby in the early 1700s, and was almost universal in that country by 1800, but other countries didn’t even <em>begin</em> to convert to coke until the mid-1800s. Again, this wasn’t because of cultural backwardness or resistance to innovation. Rather, it becomes profitable to switch to coke when you run out of wood for charcoal, and Britain ran out of wood first.</p>

<p>France makes the best comparison with Britain, because both countries had large and rapidly expanding iron industries in the 1700s. But coal was three-quarters more expensive in France than in England, whereas charcoal was less than half the price. So England smelted with coke, while France continued to use charcoal.</p>

<p>We can be fairly confident that factor prices were the cause of this difference, rather than lack of knowledge or interest, because (as with the jenny) the French government actively promoted coke smelting. In fact, a coke-burning iron works was built in the 1780s at Le Creusot, with the state as a major shareholder. Le Creusot had excellent technical advisers: the Wilkinson brothers, who had built coke furnaces in Staffordshire, and who came over from England to assist. The technology was state-of-the-art. It was set up for success in every way. But it was not able to produce cheap iron, and coke smelting was abandoned for decades. Then, in the 1830s, when charcoal prices were higher, and when the efficiency of furnaces had been improved, the works were acquired by new owners, who finally succeeded.</p>

<p>I consider this type of example to be very strong <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/epistemic-standards-for-why-it-took-so-long">evidence</a> for a statement of the form “X didn’t happen earlier because of Y”: an actual attempt at X that should have succeeded but failed because of Y, followed by a successful attempt later when circumstances changed.</p>

<p>Allen concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Failure to jump on the technological bandwagon raises questions about the competence of the managers and engineers (Landes 1969, p. 216). Their performance can be assessed through a detailed analysis of business behaviour, and Fremdling (2000) has made a convincing case that the French were shrewd judges of technology. They did, indeed, adopt English methods on a selective basis that reflected profitability.…</p>

  <p>It was not the impracticality of French engineering culture that explains the lack of attention to coke smelting. Inventing the process would not have paid.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="what-about-the-supply-side">What about the supply side?</h2>

<p>In one of the final chapters, Allen reviews the supply-side arguments. He breaks these down into two hypotheses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Cultural:</strong> “British culture developed in a distinctive way that increased the propensity to invent and led to the Industrial Revolution.”</li>
  <li>
<strong>Human capital accumulation:</strong> “Britain had more inventors because the population became more literate, numerate and skilled.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Spoiler alert: he is going to be more sympathetic to the human capital argument.</p>

<h3 id="an-industrial-enlightenment">An Industrial Enlightenment?</h3>

<p>In <em>The Enlightened Economy</em>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mokyr … attributes the ongoing inventiveness of the Industrial Revolution to the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment. The connection was the Industrial Enlightenment, namely, ‘that part of the Enlightenment that believed that material progress and economic growth could be achieved through increasing human knowledge of natural phenomena and making this knowledge accessible to those who could make use of it in production’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To test this hypothesis, Allen puts together a list of 79 important inventors of the 17th and 18th centuries, including all of the famous names such as Smeaton, Arkwright, Wedgwood, and Watt, as well as dozens of second- and third-tier inventors. He gives them three tests, corresponding to different dimensions of Mokyr’s theory:</p>

<p><strong>Did they have “indications of involvement with Enlightenment science through either social intercourse, schooling or private instruction”?</strong> Here he finds a “mixed record.” Watt, Smeaton, and Wedgwood yes. Cartwright (inventor of the power loom), Newcomen, and Darby, not so much. Arkwright had such connections—but only <em>after</em> his success. In general, the links are strongest in the fields of horology, instruments, machines, navigation, and steam. Only about half the inventors in ceramics and chemicals have such links, and they are not prevalent among inventors in metals and textiles. Overall, it’s about half and half.</p>

<p><strong>Were they experimenters?</strong> Yes, all of them: you can’t invent without experimenting. But experimenting is not new: it precedes even the Scientific Revolution; there have been tinkerers throughout history. The only thing new, Allen claims, is the quantity of experiments—and this can’t be explained by contact with Enlightenment science, which as we have just seen were inconsistent.</p>

<p>Could the Industrial Enlightenment have increased the level of experimentation indirectly, through general cultural changes? Many historians argue that Enlightenment led to the rise of secularism and a Newtonian mechanical worldview, and a decline in in the belief in magic and witchcraft. But Allen sort of shrugs and walks away from this hypothesis, saying that historians don’t agree about these shifts, and so “the case for a widespread adoption of the Newtonian worldview must remain conjectural. We must consider other explanations of the rise in experimentalism.”</p>

<p><strong>Did they come from upper-class backgrounds?</strong> The Industrial Enlightenment, Mokyr says, was “a minority affair confined to a fairly thin sliver of highly trained and literate men.” Here Allen finds the strongest evidence. Inventors were “children of the commercial manufacturing economy,” in a literal sense: not only were they not working in agriculture, but neither were their fathers. He breaks down the inventor list according to the <em>father’s</em> occupation and finds that “the likelihood of someone’s becoming an inventor increased according to his father’s income and status.” For instance, “merchants, lawyers, and capitalists” made up only 4.6% of the population, but provided 32.8% of the inventors. Conversely, “laborers, cottagers, and husbandmen” made up 54.9% of the population, but only provided 3% of the inventors:</p>

<h3 id="human-capital">Human capital</h3>

<p>The human capital hypothesis is that British inventiveness came from better education and training. Allen finds better support for this than for the “culture” hypothesis.</p>

<p>Most if not all of the inventors in the survey were literate and numerate. Most of them ran businesses, which requires writing letters and keeping accounts. And most of them were educated: privately, through schools, and/or through apprenticeships.</p>

<p>Further, there is good evidence that both literacy and numeracy were increasing in England in the 16th–18th centuries. In 1500, only an estimated 6% of English adults could sign their names; in 1800, that figure is 53%. And: “Landed gentlemen in 1500 could rarely add or subtract, while their successors two centuries later generally could.” One reason that more inventors came from upper and middle classes is that education expanded more rapidly in these groups.</p>

<p>So if education is needed for invention, and Britain was highly educated, that would explain why it was more inventive. But, Allen says, it’s hard to know how important education was, because high wages and cheap energy explain so much of the story. And there was not much difference between Britain and the rest of northwestern Europe in literacy or numeracy, so while these factors might explain why the Industrial Revolution was European rather than Asian, they can’t explain why it was British rather than Dutch. On the other hand, there were high wages in Europe for a time after the Black Death, and that didn’t lead to industrialization, so maybe human capital and even cultural factors can explain why the Industrial Revolution happened around 1800 rather than 1400.</p>

<h2 id="responses-and-criticism">Responses and criticism</h2>

<p>The book has been much discussed since it was published in 2009. Mokyr’s <em>The Enlightened Economy</em> came out in the same year, and a paper by Nicholas Crafts, “<a href="http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/44710/1/WRAP_Carfts_10.2010_craftsindustrial.pdf" target="_blank">Explaining the First Industrial Revolution: Two Views</a>,” says that the views are not mutually exclusive and may be seen as complementary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… a combination of Allen and Mokyr’s claims might produce the hypothesis that [technological development] resulted from the responsiveness of agents, which was augmented by the Enlightenment, to the wage and price configuration that underpinned the profitability of innovative effort in the eighteenth century.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After all, Mokyr is emphasizing supply factors, and Allen is emphasizing demand, but markets need both.</p>

<p>Other economic historians have pushed back on various elements of Allen’s argument:</p>

<p>Some claim that Britain’s wages were not as high as Allen says they were. For instance, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ehr.12693" target="_blank">Humphries and Schneider (2018)</a> say that in yarn spinning, the work of women and children is frequently ignored, and that when it is accounted for, “spinning emerges as a widespread, low-productivity, low-wage employment, in which wages did not rise substantially in advance of the introduction of the jenny and water frame.” <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ehr.12491" target="_blank">Stephenson (2017)</a> says that estimates for building workers’ wages are too high, because fees were paid to contractors, and the actual wages paid to workers were 20–30% less. If British wages were not much higher than French, one leg supporting the argument becomes much weaker.</p>

<p>Others criticize Allen’s analysis. For instance, <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/hal/cesptp/hal-01297060.html" target="_blank">Gragnolati, Daniele, and Emanuele (2011)</a> criticize his calculation of ROI of the spinning jenny. Those calculations assume that, using the increased productivity of the jenny, French workers would have worked less in order to produce the same output, rather than increasing output at all. This is implausible, and without this assumption, “the jenny turns out being profitable both in England and in France.”</p>

<p>Finally, others make more high-level arguments. <a href="https://antonhowes.tumblr.com/post/107971837365/inducing-ideas-for-industrialisation" target="_blank">Anton Howes points out</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… there is no mechanism by which the economic environment (the relative factor price structure) necessarily <em>induces</em> the inventive process. Imagine yourself a creative potter in the 18th Century—do high wages cause you to sit down and focus on a labour-saving invention? Or are you more likely to simply grumble and make do? There seem to be a few extra steps required here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the pseudonymous <a href="https://pseudoerasmus.com/2016/12/01/allen/" target="_blank">Pseudoerasmus adds</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… you already had capital-intensive production techniques in several sectors well before the classic industrial revolution period—especially in silk and calico-printing. Silk-throwing (analogous to spinning in cotton) was mechanised in Italy before 1700. The idea was pirated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombe's_Mill" target="_blank">Lombe</a> who set up a water-powered silk-throwing factory circa 1719, and he was imitated by many others by the 1730s. Then you had heavily machine-dependent printing works for textiles (especially calicoes) in many European cities before the canonical industrial revolution period. None of these seemed to require Allen’s “high wage economy”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Duncan Weldon has a brief, readable <a href="https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/status/1007681269814177794" target="_blank">Twitter thread on the debate</a>; <a href="https://pseudoerasmus.com/2016/12/01/allen/" target="_blank">Pseudo</a> and <a href="https://notesonliberty.com/2016/12/07/the-high-wage-economy-hypothesis/" target="_blank">Vincent Geloso</a> have more in-depth summaries.</p>

<h2 id="my-conclusions">My conclusions</h2>

<p>I learned a lot from this book; it is a classic in the field for good reason.</p>

<p>As is often the case, there are two ways you can interpret its thesis: a weak version and a strong version. The weak version is: “these demand factors are important, and they’ve been neglected or underrated.” That seems to be how Allen presents it in the introduction:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I do not ignore supply-side developments like the growth of scientific knowledge or the spread of scientific culture. However, I emphasize other factors increasing the supply of technology that have not received their due, in particular the high real wage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That much I buy. Overall, I think Allen is pointing to a real phenomenon here, and his research and argument is solid.</p>

<p>The strong version is: “demand is the explanation for the Industrial Revolution, and supply is not really relevant.” Allen doesn’t <em>say</em> this, but it’s the impression I get based on the emphasis of the book. Also, in condensed statements like his popular article “<a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/why-was-industrial-revolution-british" target="_blank">Why was the Industrial Revolution British?</a>” he drops all the nuance and deference to other arguments and just flatly says that the cause was economic. In any case, I don’t follow Allen all the way to the strong conclusion (if that is indeed his view).</p>

<p><a href="https://notesonliberty.com/2016/12/07/the-high-wage-economy-hypothesis/" target="_blank">Vincent Geloso illustrates</a> a spectrum of ways to think about this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the graph below, the “realistically multi-causal” explanation is how I see HWE [the High-Wage Economy hypothesis]. In Allen’s explanation, it holds the place that cause #1 does. According to other economists, HWE holds spot #2 or spot #3 and Mokyr’s explanations holds spot #1.</p>

<h3 id="there-is-more-to-explain">There is more to explain</h3>

<p>One reason I don’t buy the strong claim is that Allen’s argument isn’t focused on <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/the-epistemic-virtue-of-scope-matching">the scope needed to make it</a>. He is mostly seeking to explain mechanization and energy. But there are <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/think-wider">a lot more related phenomena going on at the same time</a> (1700s–1800s):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improvements in factory organization, such as at the Wedgwood pottery works</li>
  <li>Improvements in agriculture, including new <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/advanced-stages-of-agriculture">crop rotations</a> and <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/turning-air-into-bread">fertilizers</a>
</li>
  <li>Improvements in <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/navigating-the-high-seas">maritime navigation</a>, such as the marine chronometer (which Allen mentions, and attributes to the Scientific Revolution)</li>
  <li>Synthetic chemicals, such as dyes and pharmaceuticals</li>
  <li>New materials, such as <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/instant-stone-just-add-water">Portland cement</a> and cellophane</li>
  <li>The development of <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/smallpox-and-vaccines">immunization techniques against smallpox</a>
</li>
  <li>Improvements in <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/draining-the-swamp">sanitation</a>, such as new sewer systems</li>
  <li>New social systems, replacing monarchy with representative government</li>
  <li>The abolitionist movement that ended slavery</li>
  <li>The beginnings of the women’s suffrage movement</li>
</ul>

<p>(Anton and Pseudo make similar points in their posts linked above.)</p>

<p>I don’t see any fundamental factor price argument that can explain mechanization, energy, agriculture, navigation, materials, health, democracy, and equal rights. But the Enlightenment can.</p>

<h3 id="we-need-to-look-earlier-than-the-industrial-revolution">We need to look earlier than the Industrial Revolution</h3>

<p>That said, let’s take Allen’s conclusion for what it’s worth: mechanization and the use of steam power could only have taken off in an economy that already had high wages and cheap energy. Where did high wages and cheap energy come from?</p>

<p>High wages come from high productivity, so this points to pre-industrial productivity increases. Much of this came from improvements in agriculture (which Allen describes in chapters that I have omitted from my summary above, since they’re not on the core line of argument). Similarly, cheap energy came from developing Britain’s coal reserves. As Allen explains, this was not a matter of geology but of economics:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is not simply a question of coal being in the ground, for Britain’s coal deposits were largely ignored at earlier dates and the exploitation of the coal resources of other countries—Germany and China are important examples—occurred centuries after the rise of the British coal industry. The exploitation of coal had social and economic causes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we trace both of these things back further, Allen argues that they were driven by the growth of cities (especially London) and the expansion of trade. The growing cities pulled workers away from the farms, and created more demand for food, which motivated and necessitated improvements in agricultural productivity. New consumer goods from trade gave workers more to strive for and actually motivated them to work harder (the so-called “industrious revolution”). All of this expanding activity created more demand for fuel, and burned through all the wood, motivating and necessitating the development of coal mines.</p>

<p>In short, the pre-requisite of the Industrial Revolution was a certain amount of prior economic growth: wages and energy prices are a part of this, and those in turn are traced back to prior growth in cities and trade. Allen makes this point explicitly, multiple times. So to me, the key question is: where did <em>that</em> growth come from? And if we keep tracing it back, how far does it go? When did it all begin?</p>

<p>Allen’s goal is to explain the Industrial Revolution. In the sense that an economic historian uses that term, it is a narrow development: a period of less than a century from the late 1700s to the early 1800s that saw the diffusion of steam power and mechanization. But the Industrial Revolution is not an isolated phenomenon. It was the beginning of something much broader, the Industrial <em>Age</em>, which extends up to the present day and encompasses later developments such as mass manufacturing, electricity, internal combustion, synthetic chemistry, electronics, computing, and antibiotics. And that is part of a still broader phenomenon: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Divergence" target="_blank">Great Divergence</a> in which Western economies started growing faster than the rest of the world.</p>

<p>If what we want to understand is economic growth in the modern period, then we need to look earlier than the Industrial Revolution, simply because the story starts earlier. Agricultural improvements are evident by the 1600s. The rapid growth of London began in the 1500s. The voyages of discovery and the growth of printing had already differentiated Europe by the 1400s.</p>

<p>I think that Allen’s demand factors influence the <em>shape</em> or <em>direction</em> of progress, but I don’t see how they explain the <em>rate</em> of progress, which seems to me to be much more driven by supply factors. If you have a scientific society, surplus profits to invest in R&amp;D, an educated, literate and numerate population, “bourgeois virtues,” a “culture of growth”—then progress is going to happen. <em>Where</em> the talent and investment go, what problems they work on, will be determined by what the biggest opportunities are at the margin, which depends on technical and economic factors in a given place and time. Maybe in the Middle Ages, the most important problems to work on were printing, trade routes, and agricultural productivity. By the 18th century, the top priority was industrialization.</p>

<p>In other words, industrialization was just one phase of a much bigger story that extends both before and after the Industrial Revolution. If you want to explain why <em>that specific phase</em> happened when it did, and why it happened in Britain rather than France or the Netherlands, then pointing to specific technical and economic factors such as wages and energy makes sense. But if you want to explain the bigger picture, the longer arc, I think you need to look to broader and deeper causes.</p>

								<p><em>TL;DR: The DuckDB team is <i>very happy</i> to announce that today we’re releasing DuckDB version 1.0.0, codename “Snow Duck” (anas nivis).</em></p>
							
							<p>To install the new version, please visit the <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/installation">installation guide</a>.
For the release notes, see the <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/releases/tag/v1.0.0">release page</a>.</p>

<p>It has been almost six years since the first source code was written for the project back in 2018, and a <em>lot</em> has happened since: There are now over 300&nbsp;000 lines of C++ engine code, over 42&nbsp;000 commits and almost 4&nbsp;000 issues were opened and closed again. DuckDB has also gained significant popularity: the project has attracted tens of thousands of stars and followers on GitHub and social media platforms. Download counts are in the millions each month, and download traffic just for extensions is upwards of four terabytes <em>each day</em>. There are even <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/duckdb-in-action">books</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-DuckDB-practical-efficiently/dp/1803241004">being</a> <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/duckdb-up-and/9781098159689/">written</a> about DuckDB, and – most importantly – now even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDB">Wikipedia considers DuckDB notable</a>, albeit barely.</p>

<p>Of course, version numbers are somewhat arbitrary and “feely”, despite <a href="https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html">attempts</a> at making them more mechanical. We could have released DuckDB 1.0.0 back in 2018, or we could have waited ten more years. There is never a great moment, because software (with the exception of <a href="https://x.com/fermatslibrary/status/1740324503308169507">TeX</a>) is never “done”. Why choose today?</p>

<p>Data management systems – even purely analytical ones – are such core components of any application that there is always an implicit contract of trust between their developers and users. Users rely on databases to provide correct query results and to not lose their data. At the same time, system developers need to be aware of their responsibility of not breaking people’s applications willy-nilly. Intuitively, version 1.0.0 means something else for a data management system than it means for an egg timer app (no offense). From the very beginning, we were committed to making DuckDB a reliable base for people to build their applications on. This is also why the 1.0.0 release is named after the non-existent <em>snow duck (anas nivis),</em> harking back to Apple’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2009/08/mac-os-x-10-6/">Snow Leopard</a> release some years ago.</p>

<p>For us, one of the major blockers to releasing 1.0.0 was the storage format. DuckDB has its own custom-built data storage format. This format allows users to manage many (possibly very large) tables in a single file with full transactional semantics and state-of-the-art compression. Of course, designing a new file format is not without its challenges, and we had to make significant changes to the format over time. This led to the suboptimal situation that whenever a new DuckDB version was released, the files created with the old version did not work with the new DuckDB version and had to be manually upgraded. This problem was addressed in v0.10.0 back in February – where we introduced <a href="https://duckdb.org/2024/02/13/announcing-duckdb-0100#backward-compatibility">backward compatibility and limited forward compatibility for DuckDB’s storage format</a>. This feature has now been used in the wild for a while without serious issues – providing us with the confidence to offer a guarantee that DuckDB files created with DuckDB 1.0.0 will be compatible with future DuckDB versions.</p>
      <h2 id="stability">
        
        <a href="#stability">Stability</a>
        
      </h2>
    

<p>The core theme of the 1.0.0 release is stability. This contrasts it with previous releases where we have had blog posts talk about long lists of new features. Instead, the 1.0.0 release has very limited new features (a <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/11677">few</a> <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/11918">might</a> <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/11831">have</a> <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/11835">snuck</a> in). Instead, our focus has been on stability.</p>

<p>We’ve observed the frankly staggering growth in the amount and breadth of use of DuckDB in the wild, and have not seen an increase in serious issues being reported. Meanwhile, there are thousands of test cases with millions of test queries being run every night. We run loads of microbenchmarks and standardized benchmark suites to spot performance regressions. DuckDB is constantly being tortured by various fuzzers that construct all manners of wild SQL queries to make sure we don’t miss weird corner cases. All told, this has built the necessary confidence in us to release a 1.0.0.</p>

<p>Another core aspect of stability with the 1.0.0 release is stability across versions. While <a href="https://xkcd.com/1172/">never breaking anyone’s workflow is likely impossible</a>, we plan to be much more careful with user-facing changes going forward. In particular, we plan to focus on providing stability for the SQL dialect, as well as the C API. While we do not guarantee that we will never change semantics in these layers in the future – we will try to provide ample warning when doing so, as well as providing workarounds that allow previously working code to keep on working.</p>
      <h2 id="looking-ahead">
        
        <a href="#looking-ahead">Looking ahead</a>
        
      </h2>
    

<p>Unlike many open-source projects, DuckDB also has a healthy long-term funding strategy. <a href="https://duckdblabs.com/">DuckDB Labs</a>, the company that employs DuckDB’s core contributors, has not had any outside investments, and as a result, the company is fully owned by the team. Labs’ business model is to provide consulting and support services for DuckDB, and we’re happy to report that this is going well. With the revenue from contracts, we fund long-term and strategic DuckDB development with a team of almost 20 people. At the same time, the intellectual property in the project is guarded by the independent <a href="https://duckdb.org/foundation/">DuckDB Foundation</a>. This non-profit foundation ensures that DuckDB will be around long-term under the MIT license.</p>

<p>Regarding long-term plans, there are, of course, many things on the roadmap still. One thing we’re very excited about is the ability to expand the extension environment around DuckDB. Extensions are plug-ins that can add new SQL-level functions, file formats, optimizers, etc. while keeping the DuckDB core mean and lean. There are already an impressive number of third-party extensions to DuckDB, and we’re working hard to streamline the process of building and distributing community-contributed extensions. We think DuckDB can become the basis for the next revolution in data through community extensions connected by a high-performance data fabric accessible through a unified SQL interface.</p>

<p>Of course, there will be issues found in today’s release. But rest assured, there will be a 1.0.1 release. There will be a 1.1.0. And there might also be a 2.0.0 at some point. We’re in this for the long run, all of us, together. We have the team and the structures and resources to do so.</p>

<p>First of all, we are very, very grateful to you all. Our massive and heartfelt thanks go to everyone who has contributed code, filed issues or engaged in discussions, promoted DuckDB in their environment, and, of course, all DuckDB users. We could not have done it without you!</p>

<p>We would also like to thank the <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/en/groups/database-architectures/">CWI Database Architectures group</a> for providing us with the environment and expertise to build DuckDB, the organizations that provided us with research grants early on, the excellent <a href="https://duckdblabs.com/#collaborators">customers of DuckDB Labs</a> that make it all work (especially the early ones), and the generous donors to the <a href="https://duckdb.org/foundation/">DuckDB Foundation</a>. We are particularly grateful to our long-standing Gold sponsors <a href="https://motherduck.com/">MotherDuck</a>, <a href="https://voltrondata.com/">Voltron Data</a> and <a href="https://posit.co/">Posit</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, we would like to thank the <a href="https://duckdblabs.com/#about">excellent and amazing team at DuckDB Labs</a>.</p>

<p>So join us now in being nostalgic, teary-eyed and excited for what’s to come for DuckDB and celebrate the release of DuckDB 1.0.0 with us. We certainly will.</p>

<p>Mark and Hannes</p>

<p>PS: We are holding our next community event, <a href="https://duckdb.org/2024/08/15/duckcon5">DuckCon #5</a>, in Seattle on August 15, only a few short weeks from today. Attendance is free. Hope to see you there!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>For an exact calculation we need to address a few choices: (you can change them, the answer will not be tremendously affected)</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the receiver? Let's assume a 70 m dish, like this one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra_Deep_Space_Communication_Complex#/media/File:DSS43.jpg" rel="noreferrer">[CDSCC]</a> in the Deep Space Network.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1" rel="noreferrer">[Voyager 1]</a> can transmit at <span>$2.3 {\rm GHz}$</span> or <span>$8.4 {\rm GHz}$</span>. Let's assume <span>$8.4 {\rm GHz}$</span>, for better beam forming (but probably it can only use the lowest frequency at the highest power, so this could be too optimistic).</li>
<li>Does "received" mean all photons hitting the antenna dish, or only those entering the electronic circuit of the first LNA? A similar question can be asked for the transmitter in the space craft. We'll ignore this here since losses related to illuminators or Cassegrain construction will not even be one order of magnitude, insignificant compared with the rest.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answers:</strong><br>
<strong>A)</strong> Voyager sends <span>$160$</span> bits/second with <span>$23{\rm W}$</span>. Using <span>$8.3 {\rm GHz}$</span> this is <span>$4 \cdot 10^{24}$</span> photons per second, or <span>$2.6 \cdot 10^{22}$</span> per bit, because for frequency <span>$f$</span> the energy per photon is only
<span>$$E_\phi=\hbar\, \omega=2\pi\hbar f=5.5\cdot10^{-24}{\rm J} \ \ 
\text{or} \ \ 5.5 \ \text{yJ (yoctojoule)}.$$</span></p>
<p><strong>B)</strong> The beam forming by Voyager's <span>$d=3.7{\rm m}$</span>  dish will direct them predominantly to Earth, with <span>$(\pi d/\lambda)^2$</span> antenna gain, but still, at the current  distance of <span>$R=23.5$</span> billion kilometers, this only results in <span>$3.4\cdot10^{-22}$</span>  Watt per square meter reaching Earth, so a receiver with a <span>$D=70{\rm m}$</span> dish will collect only <span>$1.3$</span> attowatt (<span>$1.3\cdot 10^{-18}{\rm W}$</span>), summarized by:
<span>$$
  P_{\rm received} = P_{\rm transmit}\ \Big(\frac{\pi d}{\lambda}\Big)^2 \ \frac1{4\pi R^2}\ \frac{\pi D^2}4
$$</span>
Dividing by <span>$E_\phi$</span> we see that this power then still corresponds to c. <span>$240000$</span> photons per second, or <span>$1500$</span> photons per bit. If we assume <span>$f=2.3{\rm GHz}$</span> this becomes <span>$415$</span> photons per bit. And if we introduce some realistic losses here and there perhaps only half of that.</p>
<p><strong>C)</strong> (Although not asked in the question) how many photons per bit are needed? The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theorem#Statement_of_the_theorem" rel="noreferrer">[Shannon limit]</a> <span>$ C=B \, \log_2(1+{\large\frac{S}{N}})$</span>, relates bandwidth <span>$B$</span>, and <span>$S/N$</span> ratio to maximum channel capacity. It follows that with only thermal noise <span>$N=k\, T_{\rm noise}\,B$</span>, the required energy per bit is:
<span>$$ E_{\rm bit} = \frac S C = k\, T_{\rm noise} \ \frac{2^{\,C/B}-1}{C/B}
\ \Rightarrow \  \lim_{C\ll B}\ E_{\rm bit} = k\, T_{\rm noise} \log 2, 
$$</span>
where <span>$C\ll B$</span> is the so-called "ultimate" Shannon limit. With only the CMB <span>$(T_{\rm noise}\!=\!3{\rm K})$</span> we would then need <span>$41 {\rm yJ}$</span>, or <span>$41 \cdot 10^{-24}\,{\rm J}$</span>, per bit.
That's only <span>$7.5$</span> photons at <span>$8.3 {\rm GHz}$</span>. But additional atmospheric noise and circuit noise, even with a good cryogenic receiver, could easily raise <span>$T_{\rm noise}$</span> to about <span>$10{\rm K}$</span> and then we need <span>$25$</span> photons per bit at <span>$8.3 {\rm GHz}$</span>, and even <span>$91$</span> at <span>$2.3 {\rm GHz}$</span>. So clearly there is not much margin.</p>

            <pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 09:42:36 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2015/11/27/why-rubys-timeout-is-dangerous-and-thread-dot-raise-is-terrifying/">https://jvns.ca/blog/2015/11/27/why-rubys-timeout-is-dangerous-and-thread-dot-raise-is-terrifying/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40560913">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>This is already documented in <a href="http://www.mikeperham.com/2015/05/08/timeout-rubys-most-dangerous-api/">Timeout: Ruby’s most dangerous API</a>. And normally I don’t like making blanket statements about language features. But I had a bad day at work because of this issue. So today, we’re talking about Timeout! :)</p>

<p>First! What is Timeout? Let’s say you have a bunch of code, that might be slow. A network request, a long computation, whatever.  Ruby’s <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.2/libdoc/timeout/rdoc/Timeout.html">timeout documentation</a> helpfully says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Timeout provides a way to auto-terminate a potentially long-running operation if it hasn’t finished in a fixed amount of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>require 'timeout'
status = Timeout::timeout(5) {
  # Something that should be interrupted if it takes more than 5 seconds...
}
</code></pre>

<p>AWESOME. This is so much easier than wrangling network socket options which might be set deep inside some client library. Seems great!</p>

<p>I tried using Timeout at work last week, and it resulted in an extremely difficult to track down bug. I felt awesome about tracking it down, and upset with myself about creating it in the first place. Let’s talk a little more about this (mis)feature.</p>

<h2 id="timeout-how-it-works-and-why-thread-raise-is-terrifying">Timeout: how it works (and why Thread.raise is terrifying)</h2>

<p>Its implementation originally seems kind of clever. You can read <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/lib/timeout.rb#L72">the code here</a>. It starts a new thread, which sets the original thread to <code>x</code>, sleeps for 5 seconds, then raises an exception on the main thread when it’s done, interrupting whatever it was doing.</p>

<pre><code>begin
  sleep sec
rescue =&gt; e
  x.raise e
else
  x.raise exception, message
end
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s look at the documentation on <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Thread.html#method-i-raise">Thread.raise</a>. It says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Raises an exception (see Kernel::raise) from thr. The caller does not have to be thr.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is where the implications get interesting, and terrifying. This means that an exception can get raised:</p>

<ul>
<li>during a network request (ok, as long as the surrounding code is prepared to catch <code>Timeout::Error</code>)</li>
<li>during the cleanup for the network request</li>
<li>during a <code>rescue</code> block</li>
<li>while creating an object to save to the database afterwards</li>
<li>in <strong>any</strong> of your code, regardless of whether it could have possibly raised an exception before</li>
</ul>

<p>Nobody writes code to defend against an exception being raised <strong>on literally any line</strong>. That’s not even possible. So <code>Thread.raise</code> is basically like a sneak attack on your code that could result in almost anything. It would probably be okay if it were pure-functional code that did not modify any state. But this is Ruby, so that’s unlikely :)</p>

<p>Timeout uses Thread.raise, so it is not safe to use.</p>

<h2 id="other-languages-and-thread-raise">Other languages and Thread.raise</h2>

<p>So, how do other languages approach this? Go doesn’t have exceptions, Javascript doesn’t have threads – let’s talk about Python, Java, and C#, and C++.</p>

<p><strong>Java</strong> has <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#stop%28java.lang.Throwable%29">java.lang.Thread.stop</a>, which does essentially the same thing. It was deprecated in Java 1.2, in 1998, disabled entirely in Java 8, and its documentation reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Deprecated.</strong> This method is inherently unsafe. See stop() for details. An additional danger of this method is that it may be used to generate exceptions that the target thread is unprepared to handle (including checked exceptions that the thread could not possibly throw, were it not for this method). For more information, see <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/concurrency/threadPrimitiveDeprecation.html">Why are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated?.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Python</strong> has <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/thread.html#thread.interrupt_main">thread.interrupt_main()</a>, which does the same thing as Ctrl+C-ing a program from your terminal. I’m not really sure what to say about this – certainly using <code>thread.interrupt_main()</code> also isn’t really a good idea, and it’s more limited in what it can do. I can’t find any reference to anybody considering using it for anything serious.</p>

<p><strong>C#</strong> has <code>Thread.Abort()</code> which throws a <code>ThreadAbortException</code> in the thread. Googling it finds me a series of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1559255/whats-wrong-with-using-thread-abort">StackOverflow discussions</a> &amp; forum posts about how it’s dangerous and should not be used, for the reasons we’ve learned about.</p>

<p><strong>C++</strong>: <code>std::thread</code>s <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread">are not interruptible</a>.</p>

<h2 id="not-just-an-implementation-issue">Not just an implementation issue</h2>

<p>This is not just an implementation issue in Ruby, and you can read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3ui1sw/why_rubys_timeout_is_dangerous_and_threadraise_is/cxfg98b">a great comment on Reddit illustrating this</a>. The whole premise of a general timeout method that will interrupt an arbitrary block of code like this is flawed. Here’s the API again:</p>

<pre><code>require 'timeout'
status = Timeout::timeout(5) {
  # Something that should be interrupted if it takes more than 5 seconds...
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is no way to safely interrupt an arbitrary block of code. <strong>Anything</strong> could be happening at the end of that 5 seconds.</p>

<p>However! All is not lost if we would like to interrupt our threads. Let’s turn to Java again! (you know all the times we say Ruby is more fun than Java? TODAY JAVA IS MORE FUN BECAUSE IT MAKES MORE SENSE.) Java has a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/interrupt.html">Thread.interrupt</a> method, which sends <code>InterruptedException</code> to a thread. But an InterruptedException is only allowed to be thrown at specific times, for instance during <code>Thread.sleep</code>. Otherwise the thread needs to explicitly call <code>Thread.interrupted()</code> to see if it’s supposed to stop.</p>

<h2 id="on-documentation">On documentation</h2>

<p>I don’t know. It’s possible that everybody knew that <code>Timeout</code> was a disaster except for me, and that I should have thought more carefully about what the implications of this <code>Thread.raise</code> were. But I’m thinking of making a pull request on the Ruby documentation with slightly stronger language than</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Timeout provides a way to auto-terminate a potentially long-running operation if it hasn’t finished in a fixed amount of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Raises an exception (see Kernel::raise) from thr. The caller does not have to be thr.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Java approach (where they deprecated it with a strong warning and then disabled the method entirely) seems more like the right thing.</p>

<p>The highly controversial indiscriminate child sexual abuse regulation (so-called chat control) could still be endorsed by EU governments after all, as France could give up its previous veto. This is <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/law-enforcement/news/audio-communications-excluded-in-latest-draft-of-child-sexual-abuse-material-law/">reported by Euractiv</a> and confirmed by <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2024/interne-dokumente-frankreich-entscheidet-ueber-zukunft-der-chatkontrolle/">internal documents</a>. France considers the new “upload moderation” proposal in principle as a viable option.</p>



<p>According to the latest draft regulation dated 28 May (<a href="https://netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2024/05/2024-05-28_Council_Presidency_LEWP_CSAR_Compromise-texts_9093.pdf">Council document 9093/24</a>), which is presented as “upload moderation”, users of apps and services with chat functions are to be asked whether they accept the indiscriminate and error-prone scanning and possibly reporting of their privately shared images, photos and videos. Previously unknown images and videos are also to be scrutinised using “artificial intelligence” technology. If a user refuses the scanning, they would be blocked from sending or receiving images, photos, videos and links (Article 10). End-to-end encrypted services such as Whatsapp or Signal would have to implement the automated searches “prior to transmission” of a message (so-called client-side scanning, Article 10a). The initially proposed scanning of text messages for indications of grooming, which is hardly being used to date, is to be scrapped, as is the scanning of voice communication, which has never been done before. Probably as a concession to France, the chats of employees of security authorities and the military are also to be exempted from chat control.</p>



<p>During the last discussion on 24 May, the Council Legal Service made it clear that indiscriminate chat control scanning of non-suspects is still envisioned and remains a violation of fundamental rights. Nevertheless, most EU governments are determined to go ahead. EU governments plan to continue their discussions on June 4th.</p>



<p>“The Belgian proposal means that the essence of the EU Commission’s extreme and unprecedented initial chat control proposal would be implemented unchanged,” warns MEP and most prominent opponent of chat control Patrick Breyer (Pirate Party). “Using messenger services purely for texting is not an option in the 21st century. And removing excesses that aren’t being used in practice anyway is a sham.</p>



<p>Millions of private chats and private photos of innocent citizens are to be searched using unreliable technology and then leaked without the affected chat users being even remotely connected to child sexual abuse – this would destroy our digital privacy of correspondence. Our nude photos and family photos would end up with strangers in whose hands they do not belong and with whom they are not safe. Despite lip service being paid to encryption, client-side scanning would undermine previously secure end-to-end encryption in order to turn our smartphones into spies – this would destroy secure encryption.</p>



<p>I am alarmed that EU governments that have been critical so far are praising the repackaged plans, which threatens to overturn the previous blocking minority. If the EU governments really do go into the trilogue negotiations with this radical position of indiscriminate chat control scanning, experience shows that the Parliament risks gradually abandoning its initial position behind closed doors and agreeing to bad and dangerous compromises that put our online security at risk.</p>



<p>Now is the time to take to the barricades for privacy and secure encryption.”</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I’m sure I don’t need to explain why USB devices are useful. They’re all around us and our daily computers have plenty of USB ports. Even if they don’t, USB hubs can open up the possibility of more ports. This is where we plug in various devices that <strong>extend</strong> the capabilities of our machines. I’ll refer to these USB devices simply as <em>devices</em>, while referring to the machines we’re extending as <em>hosts</em>.</p>
<p>The goal of this article is to give you the simplest end-to-end journey to a working USB device. We’ll cover everything from the physical connection between the USB device and the host, and developing a super sample application that interacts with our USB device (from the host).</p>
<h2 id="what-is-usb">What is USB?</h2>
<p>Let’s cover first what exactly is USB, and for that, I’ll quote the first paragraph from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Universal Serial Bus (USB) is an industry standard that allows data exchange and delivery of power between many types of electronics. It specifies its architecture, in particular its physical interface, and communication protocols for data transfer and power delivery to and from hosts, such as personal computers, to and from peripheral devices, e.g. displays, keyboards, and mass storage devices, and to and from intermediate hubs, which multiply the number of a host’s ports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of this article will unpack this description piece by piece. To begin, though, we need to know first and foremost that USB is a <strong>serial</strong> bus. Bits go onto the bus one by one, in contrast to <strong>parallel</strong> buses. I don’t recall seeing a parallel bus for decades now. The last time I saw a parallel bus was to connect a hard disk to the motherboard with a ribbon cable. Those are outdated now, and modern buses are primarily serial. Again, this means bits go one by one, rather than in parallel. I won’t get into the details of this (mainly because I’m not an expert myself) — my understanding is that simply it’s really hard to make parallel transmission work efficiently in this context, so simple protocols end up in more elegant and faster devices. This mental model doesn’t capture nearly all the complexities, but still gives us enough to get started with USB: this is a way to exchange bits serially between the host and the device.</p>
<p>However, USB is more than just a spec on how to connect two devices and send bits back and forth. It also, per the quote above, captures some parts of the communication protocol. Let’s start unpacking, and we’ll focus on USB 2.0.</p>
<h2 id="usb-wires">USB wires</h2>
<p>You’ve likely seen different kinds of USB plugs and cables, but they all boil down to the same thing. Inside the connection are the wires to provide power from host to the device and to transfer the bits back and forth. Let’s focus on the typical USB 2.0 connection, these are the wires you’ll see inside:</p>
<ol>
<li>+5 V wire, this is where the device gets its power from, if powering from the host.</li>
<li><code>D-</code> and <code>D+</code> wires: I lump them together as one item here, since they jointly work to transfer <strong>1 bit</strong> (not 2!) as a differential pair. Much more info on that below.</li>
<li><code>GND</code> wire: unsurprisingly, this is ground.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some connections may have a few more pins, like the <code>ID</code> pin, but since this is the bare minimal writeup on USB, let’s skip that now. We’ll be working only with the 4 wires described above.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-on-usb-c">A note on USB-C</h3>
<p>USB-C is super common these days. What I wrote above for the USB wires still <em>somewhat</em> applies to USB-C, but it’s slightly different in that case. One of the main differences, obviously, is the fact that you can plug a USB-C device either way and things should work. At the core of it, there’s still a differential pair.</p>
<p>Let’s just focus on one very important thing here: if a device connects via USB-C, it still doesn’t mean anything when it comes to the speed, or even which USB version it is. It could still be a USB 2.0 device, or it could be a more modern USB 3.0 device.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, we won’t be discussing USB-C anymore here.</p>
<h3 id="data-over-a-differential-pair">Data over a differential pair</h3>
<p>If you’ve never seen differential pairs before, then having 2 wires somehow transmitting 1 bit may stump you. In the most basic computer architecture course, you learn that you only need one wire to signal a digital bit. The wire’s voltage (or should I say potential?), in relation to the ground (point of 0 volts) signals what is the value of the bit. If you’re playing with something like Raspberry Pi, you know that if you set a GPIO pin to logical 1, it gives you 3.3 V, 0 V otherwise.</p>
<p>And this is fine over something like super short distances, within a chip, or even within small traces on the PCB. However, we frequently have a need for longer distance wired connections. Your keyboard and mouse are at least a few feet away from your computer, for example.</p>
<p>This is where the differential pairs come in. Instead of having one wire at voltage <code>V</code>, in relation to <code>GND</code>, we now have <strong>two</strong> wires. One is still at voltage <code>V</code>, while the other one is the polar opposite at <code>-V</code>. When a differential pair comes out of one component into the other, what the other component considers is the voltage difference between these two wires. <code>V - (-V) = 2V</code>. There seems to be little benefit in this — we just got double the voltage we otherwise would, and that’s true in this model; however this model doesn’t paint the whole picture. We assumed our wires carry our voltage perfectly.</p>
<p>Let’s mark the voltages of these wires as <code>V+</code> and <code>V-</code>. If we use a more realistic model, <code>V+</code> isn’t simply equal to <code>V</code>, it’s equal to <code>V</code> plus some voltage noise, let’s mark it as <code>Vn</code>. Therefore <code>V+ = V + Vn</code>. Now, <code>V-</code> is similarly <code>V- = -V + Vn</code>. This time, when we calculate what the other device sees, it’s <code>V+ - V- = (V + Vn) - (-V + Vn) = 2V</code>. The voltage noise is gone! Now it’s a little clearer what the benefits of the differential pairs are.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a mega simplified view of things. For example, why do we treat the noise factor as the same for both wires here? For a more serious introduction to differential pairs, I’d recommend Zach Peterson’s videos on Altium YouTube channel, starting from this one:</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7DF25ohH8v4?si=qgSulBtaZC22ksJk" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>
<p>Now it should be clearer why I lumped <code>D+</code> and <code>D-</code> wires above as one item: these two wires carry one bit at the time. It should also be clearer why they’re identified as <code>D</code>, and what is plus and what is minus.</p>
<h2 id="usb-on-a-pcb">USB on a PCB</h2>
<p><em>If you don’t intend to make your own hardware for a USB device and instead want to use some existing development board, you can skip this altogether, but I’d still recommend quickly scanning through it.</em></p>
<p>When you add a USB connector to your PCB from some library, you should see the pins that I listed above, and you can route accordingly. Your PCB may have a microcontroller, or a more complex SoC onboard, and you’ll definitely need to run the differential pair to the relevant two neighboring pins on the chip. For routing differential pairs, there are a couple of basic things to keep in mind.</p>
<p>First, the trace from the <code>D+</code> pin on your USB connector to the plus pin for the differential pair on your chip should be of same length as the other trace for the differential pair.</p>
<p>Second, these traces should be very close to each other. For a graphical example, please check out <a href="https://resources.altium.com/p/what-are-differential-pairs-and-differential-signals">this article</a>, the graphic at the top should quickly illustrate what I’m talking about (again, great article by Zach Peterson).</p>
<p>These two principles should explain a little bit why in our (still simplistic) calculation, we assumed that the noise in our voltage is the same. The two wires are running in almost identical context and that’s how the noise ends up cancelling.</p>
<p>Third, and this is potentially very important, we should have a certain impedance for the signals. The calculations here are very complex and many factors go in. I recommend watching the following video for an introduction here:</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Itsrdc8tX7M?si=ODaZPMZtIUYz0vTq" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>
<p>tl;dr is that you’ll go to your fabricator’s website, put some parameters into the calculator, and it will calculate the missing parameters. For example, you’ll specify your target impedance for the differential pair running above a layer of ground plane, specify the distance between your differential pair lines, etc. and it will provide you with the trace width you should use in order to achieve that impedance.</p>
<p>I’ll link below to another great video by Zach Peterson about USB routing, but I think if you’re just getting started, the one above should be enough:</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4LwnEaNvG8I?si=MZNTZHSWDQgg3mGz" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>
<h2 id="different-speeds-of-usb">Different speeds of USB</h2>
<p>We said initially we’re focusing on USB 2.0, but that still doesn’t fully tell us what’s the speed we’re reaching here. Even within the same USB version, we can have different speed levels. For example, you can run USB 2.0 at <em>full speed</em>, which is 12 Mbit/s, but you could also run it at <em>high speed</em>, which is 480 Mbit/s. The device and the host need to figure out what’s the speed they’ll be utilizing when they connect.</p>
<h3 id="a-quick-note-on-the-speeds-over-pcb">A quick note on the speeds over PCB</h3>
<p>Again, you can skip this if you aren’t making your own PCB, but it still makes sense to try to parse through this, it could be useful.</p>
<p>While there seem to be many requirements for correctly routing USB over the PCB, the hardware you’re connecting on both ends, the host and the chip in your device, can be fairly forgiving, especially if you’re not going for the high speed (and at full speed, 12 Mbit/s should be more than enough for a basic prototype).</p>
<p>One of the big things about reaching high speeds is hitting the right impedance. Lots of thought needs to go into this, but from my understanding, if you’re going for full speed, you can get away with a lot (and we will in our working example below!). The trace widths don’t matter all that much, especially if your traces are short from the USB connector to your chip.</p>
<h2 id="protocol-and-software-layers">Protocol and software layers</h2>
<p>I think so far we’ve covered a decent chunk of hardware, and we should discuss what about the protocol itself and how does software (on both sides) use USB.</p>
<p>I’ll go ahead and simply recommend watching this video:</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lbmAn3b76rY?si=vZ_DfxFGssy8r5EJ" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>
<p>This video talks about USB from the Linux perspective, which is great, but we still haven’t covered Linux here. That said, the video also covers USB broadly, and is pretty well packed into ~45 minutes of content. For the purposes of this article, I’d recommend watching until the Linux example. There’s a lot of background on what the USB frames look like, how there are different endpoints involved and so on. There’s a great bit on configurations and how one device can fulfill multiple USB functionalities. I think if there is one thing to take away from that video, it’s to think about USB as a network of devices, and try to understand that. I won’t try to reproduce any of the details here, I highly recommend watching the video.</p>
<h3 id="usb-device-classes-and-how-hosts-use-them">USB device classes and how hosts use them</h3>
<p>Hosts obviously need drivers in order to abstract away the hardware and handle the interaction with their components. However, it would be unreasonable to expect that different kernels have drivers implemented for every single USB device. Instead, operating systems recognize different classes of devices.</p>
<p>Some classes are mass storage devices (probably the most common everyday use case), some are serial devices, and so on. Therefore, there is some level of uniformity across devices here. In our example below, we’ll build a sample device that’s simply a serial port from the host’s perspective.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-serial-port-device">Building a serial port device</h2>
<p>Our device will be very simple — we will have a USB-capable microcontroller that is powered by the host and serves the host by simply turning on an LED when requested. The host will see this device as a simple serial port device.</p>
<p>I see two main approaches in this kind of scenario: use a microcontroller or a Linux-ready SoC. In the latter case, the kernel itself can do a bulk of work and offer you a very clean Linux API for the functionality, but that is an overkill for this simple use case, and we’ll stick with the microcontroller. I’ll do a reflection on the state of software for this kind of a use case below.</p>
<h3 id="stm32-microcontroller-and-the-nucleo-board">STM32 microcontroller and the Nucleo board</h3>
<p>We’re opting for the first approach, which is using a USB-ready microcontroller and our development board of choice is <a href="https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f103rb.html">NUCLEO-F103RB</a>. In the US, it can be bought on something like Digikey for a little over $10.</p>
<p><img alt="Photo of NUCLEO-F103RB" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.st.com/bin/ecommerce/api/image.PF259875.en.feature-description-include-personalized-no-cpn-medium.jpg">
</p>
<p>When you look at this board, you can clearly see it consists of 2 pieces spliced together. The connection is almost like a perforation, and I’ve seen some videos on YouTube where people literally break this board in two along that connection by hand. I wouldn’t do it, though.</p>
<p>The smaller piece is the microcontroller programmer. This is where the USB connection with the computer also lies and that’s how you’ll be programming the board. Be careful though, that’s <strong>not the USB connection</strong> we’re looking for here, and this may stump you right now.</p>
<p>To be fully perfectly precise, there are 2 big chips on this Nucleo board. One lies on the programmer piece of the PCB, and the other one is the microcontroller you’re actually programming, and it lies on the bigger piece. The USB connection your computer establishes with the board is actually with the microcontroller on the programmer side. This programmer speaks the ST-LINK protocol, which to the best of my understanding, is just a protocol built on top of USB messaging. Your computer and the programmer MCU will exchange USB messages according to the ST-LINK protocol, and then that MCU will program your “main” MCU. How that happens on this board, I don’t know, nor should it matter for our experiment. It could happen over something like SPI, as far as we’re concerned, or maybe they could even have their own USB connection between themselves, who knows.</p>
<p>If you were to build your own PCB with an STM32 microcontroller, you could place one chip on the board, program it over USB and later use the same USB port for business logic between your device and the USB host. I’ll link to two videos from Phil’s Lab (fantastic materials) on building STM32-based PCBs, as well as how to do programming on these over USB. The first one is 20 minutes only, and absolutely worth your time.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-the-actual-usb-port">Setting up the actual USB port</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve established that the USB connection we have on the Nucleo board indeed isn’t connected to the chip that we’re actually programming, we need to figure out a way to get that USB port from the “main” chip to work.</p>
<p>In this exercise, once we program the chip, we’ll disconnect the ST-LINK programmer piece from the computer, and power our main chip from the “real” USB port instead. Below is how we do it, step by step. We’ll be using STM32CubeIDE to write the software, and then use STM32CubeProgrammer to drop that software onto the board, in order to keep things simple.</p>
<p>The first thing we need to do is identify which pins on the MCU are able to work as the USB port. We’re making a USB 2.0 device, keeping things simple, and this is what we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pin to supply 5 V power from the host device.</li>
<li><code>GND</code> pin.</li>
<li><code>D+</code> and <code>D-</code> pins that can handle the USB differential pair data.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>GND</code> is trivial, and so should be the 5 V power. The only detail regarding powering this board over the “proper” USB port is that you need to change the pins on jumper <code>JP5</code> in order to configure the board to accept “external 5 V” supply. Check the board documentation for more details, but this is really all I had to do. With that, we’ve taken care of 2 pins.</p>
<p>In your STM32CubeIDE app, you should configure (through the UI) <code>PA12</code> to act as <code>USB_DP</code> and <code>PA11</code> to act as <code>USB_DM</code> (+ and -, respectively, of course). The end result should look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Photo of the LED experiment" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://popovicu.com/assets/cubeide_usb_ports.png.webp" height="319" width="781">
</p>
<p>Now, one important thing to note is that the chip on this board will expect an <strong>external</strong> 1.5 kΩ resistor to be present in the circuit for the USB connection to work. To make this simple, I just bought a pack of 1.5 kΩ resistors from Amazon (not the cheapest solution, though). That resistor should be pulling up the pin <code>PA12</code> to 3.3 V, which you can also find on the Nucleo board. I used a breadboard to wire this up, so nothing fancy is required.</p>
<p>Now that we have identified these 4 pins on the board (plus the 3.3 V for pull-up) and flipped the power supply jumper, we’re ready to make the physical connection to the host. In my case, this is a MacBook Pro running Mac OS. To be able to connect my MacBook to these individual pins, I used a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QQQZ1DV?th=1">breakout cable from Amazon</a>. For this particular cable that I linked, I popped off the terminal blocks (it’s all modular) and instead got the USB pins exposed. There were 5 pins, but you can ignore the S pin for this exercise. After that, I used regular jumper wires to connect these pins to my Nucleo board, as well as the breadboard where I handled the pull-up for the <code>PA12</code> pin.</p>
<p>I’d like to quickly point back to all the previous notes about length matching with differential pairs, impedance control and so on — as you can see, we’re super relaxed here, and we will be able to achieve the 12 Mbit/s connection regardless. This is what I meant when I said that the devices can be pretty forgiving, at least at some speed.</p>
<p>We’re now wired up and ready to go!</p>
<h3 id="writing-the-software">Writing the software</h3>
<p>Once you set up the USB pins in CubeIDE, you’ll get some notifications about the clock set up — go for the option where CubeIDE takes care of it for you, it should be able to fix things up. There are a few things to set up for the software part of the USB left.</p>
<p>In <code>Pinout &amp; Configuration</code> section, you will see a sub-menu called <code>Middleware and Software Packs</code>. In there, you should see a <code>USB_DEVICE</code> option, so let’s open that.</p>
<p><img alt="Photo of the LED experiment" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://popovicu.com/assets/cubeide_usb_setup.png.webp" height="719" width="1886" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://popovicu.com/assets/cubeide_usb_setup.png.webp 1886w, https://popovicu.com/assets/cubeide_usb_setup@986w.webp 986w, https://popovicu.com/assets/cubeide_usb_setup@686w.webp 686w">
</p>
<p>What really matters for this exercise is to set up the mode of the device to:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>Communication Device Class (Virtual Port Com)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This will ensure that your Nucleo board behaves as a serial port device (CDC) from the host perspective. Thus, your host will be able to set up the correct drivers in order to work with your custom device.</p>
<p>At this point, CubeIDE will also generate some C code in your program. In my <code>main.c</code> file, I see a line that says:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>MX_USB_DEVICE_Init</span><span>();</span></span></code></pre>
<p>For a more step-by-step guide on all this, if the above wasn’t enough, please take a look at this video:</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZjnCOun1wU?si=i-Gr818H4iPckurV" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>
<p>We’ll do pretty much the same thing as in this video, in order to enable turning on of the LED (we’ll skip turning off in this exercise). The <code>CDC_Receive_FS</code> routine will have this snippet:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>/* USER CODE BEGIN 6 */</span></span>
<span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>Buf</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>] </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>'1'</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>	</span><span>HAL_GPIO_WritePin</span><span>(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_5, </span><span>1</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This call to the HAL layer will switch on the onboard LED, which is connected to pin 5 of port A.</p>
<h3 id="flashing-and-running">Flashing and running</h3>
<p>You can go ahead and build the ELF file and use the CubeProgrammer to drop the code bytes onto the board. Once that is done, you can unplug the programmer and wire the board as we described above, powering it from “external 5 V” supply.</p>
<p>Once your board powers on, you should be able to see it in whatever device manager your operating system has. Unless you’re running something extremely exotic, I would expect your operating system to be able to recognize the device. In the USB section of your device manager, you should see something like a “COM port”, or a “Serial port” or something along those lines.</p>
<p>If you want to be extra cool, you can go back to CubeIDE, head over to the <code>USB_DEVICE</code> menu for the middleware where we previously set up the CDC class for our microcontroller software, and take a look at the bottom section. There, you are able to change the values in the <code>Device Descriptor</code> section, and set up a custom name for your device. That would be reflected in your operating system’s device manager.</p>
<p>And for the fun part, you need to connect to your serial port and send byte ‘1’ to make the LED flip on. On my Mac OS, I can find my new device under the <code>/dev</code> filesystem tree. It’s listed on my machine as <code>/dev/tty.usbmodem497A0F6739561</code>. If you’re on Linux, you should get something similar. You may see it listed as <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code> or something like that. I’ll use Minicom to talk to this serial device, but you can do pretty much anything here, as long as it works with the serial ports on your device. I run something like this:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>minicom --device /dev/tty.usbmodem497A0F6739561</span></span></code></pre>
<p>At this point, I can simply tap the number ‘1’ on my keyboard, and the green LED on the Nucleo board should go green.</p>

</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We’ve basically built a USB serial port device from scratch, and it’s recognized (hopefully) by any mainstream operating system. There’s a bit of theory in the beginning regarding building the PCBs that can do this, and I hope that was helpful as well.</p>
<p>I mentioned that from the software perspective, high level, there are 2 approaches: use a microcontroller or with a more complex system, let something like Linux kernel handle the software on the device side. The first approach was simpler for this exercise, but I will highlight that I’m not a huge fan of how things are with STM32 here.</p>
<p>This is mostly from a software engineering perspective, and I feel more comfortable sharing my opinions here, given that my professional background is mostly in software engineering. For a start, I don’t like how we have to generate a ton of boilerplate with the IDE after clicking through the UI menus. I wish that we had a library that was more flexible and parameterized in code, so that we can have something like <code>InitUsbDevice(UsbClass.CDC)</code>, instead of going through the UIs to generate the code. There’s also <strong>a lot</strong> of boilerplate with STM32, and it’s very tightly coupled with the user code. In my view, this makes code reviews very difficult. Additionally, how exactly do we update all this boilerplate when a new version is out? This seems a bit like an afterthought with the CubeIDE, and it’s not unheard of in the embedded world. I’ve read some research that says that an overwhelming majority of the embedded devices never see a software update (this can make a lot of software engineers recoil as they read it). There are also other things that are tricky here, for example, what if one day we wanted to change our microcontroller for something different? We’re super tied into the STM32 world with this current set up.</p>
<p>There’s a reason why I mentioned Linux being able to act as a USB device — I believe that’s a much cleaner approach. The Linux APIs are much more solid and standardized. Things with Linux would be based on interactions with the pseudo-files and some system calls. The user space is very cleanly separated from the kernel space. Additionally, I think of Linux as <em>the HAL</em> layer. If our microcontroller could run Linux, we’d see a very nice view of all these devices and there wouldn’t be a need for wonky HAL libraries and so on.</p>
<p>That said, obviously, sometimes we want lightweight and cheap USB devices that are easy to produce. Linux SoCs are more heavyweight, obviously, and may be an overkill for a lot of use cases. I guess my main point here is that I wish there were more portable and less opinionated frameworks for building bare metal USB devices than what’s available out there. There are things that drive me away from some of them that may be widely accepted: things like frameworks dictating a particular build system that should be used, etc.</p>
<p>All this may or may not be a big deal for your project, it’s ultimately for you to decide. I hope I’ll have some time in the near future to play around with this other variation, using Linux itself as the way to implement software on the USB device side, but that’s for another day. For now, let’s enjoy starting up our first custom USB devices that can cleanly integrate with our standard everyday machines like our laptops.</p>
<p>As always, I hope this was useful.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>During AMD's Computex 2024 kick-off keynote, AMD's CEO, Dr. Lisa Su, officially unveiled and announced the company's next generation of Ryzen processors. Today marks the first unveiling of AMD's highly anticipated Zen 5 microarchitecture via the Ryzen 9000 series, which is set to bring several advancements over Zen 4 and the Ryzen 7000 series for desktop PCs, which will launch sometime in July 2024.</p>

<p>AMD has unveiled four new chip SKUs using its Zen 5 microarchitecture. The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X processor will be the new consumer flagship part, featuring 16 CPU cores and a speedy 5.7 GHz maximum boost frequency. The other SKUs include, 6, 8, and 12 core parts, giving users a varied combination of core and thread counts. All four of these initial chips will be X-series chips, meaning they will have an unlocked multipliers and higher TDPs/clockspeeds.</p>

<p>In regards to performance, AMD is touting an average (geomean) IPC increase in desktop workloads for Zen 5 of 16%. And with the new desktop Ryzen chips' turbo clockspeeds remaining largely identical to their Ryzen 7000 predecessors, this should translate into similar performance expectations for the new chips.</p>

<p>The AMD Ryzen 9000 series will also launch on the AM5 socket, which debuted with AMD's Ryzen 7000 series and marks AMD's commitment to socket/platform longevity. Along with the Ryzen 9000 series will come a pair of new high-performance chipsets: the X870E (Extreme) and the regular X870 chipsets. The fundamental features that vendors will integrate into their specific motherboards remain tight-lipped. Still, we do know that USB 4.0 ports are standard on the X870E/X870 boards, along with PCIe 5.0 for both PCIe graphics and NVMe storage, with higher AMD EXPO memory profile support expected than previous generations.</p>

<h2>AMD Ryzen 9000: Bringing Up to 16C/32T of Zen 5 to Desktop</h2>

<p>Zen 5 is AMD's latest advancement in Ryzen microarchitecture. While AMD hasn't disclosed many technical details, we know some of the brand-new features that Zen 5 will offer.</p>

<p>Looking at architectural differences between the last couple of generations (Zen 4 and Zen 3) and Zen 5, we know that AMD uses a new manufacturing process for its Ryzen 9000 desktop chips. While many have touted and speculated that Zen 5 for desktops will be built on one of TSMC's N3 (3 nm) nodes, some of our sources are saying that the Zen 5 CCD will be fabbed on TSMC N4 – though we are awaiting official confirmation about this (Update: And TSMC 4nm is now confirmed for the consumer Ryzen CCD). Furthermore, AMD's mobile counterpart offering, the Ryzen AI 300 series (Strix Point) has been confirmed for 4nm, and we've yet to see an AMD desktop CPU die produced on a more advanced node than its mobile counterpart.</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/AMD%20COMPUTEX%20CLIENT%20PRESS%20DECK-01-01%20%2810%29.png"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/AMD%20COMPUTEX%20CLIENT%20PRESS%20DECK-01-01%20%2810%29.png"></a></p>

<p>While AMD is not offering a deep dive into the Zen 5 architecture at Computex, the company did touch upon a few of the major architectural improvements over Zen 4 that will be coming with the new CPU architecture. These start with an improved branch predictor, which is designed to offer better accuracy, efficiency, and reduced overall latency of instruction cycles. The Zen 5 architecture also boasts higher throughput with wider pipelines and SIMDs, allowing for faster data processing and equating to better overall performance in benchmarks such as CineBench and Blender and workloads leveraging the AVX-512 instruction set.</p>

<p>Additionally, Zen 5 introduces a deeper out-of-order instruction window size across its design, enabling more parallelism and better handling of multiple instructions within the pipeline simultaneously.</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/AMD%20COMPUTEX%20CLIENT%20PRESS%20DECK-01-01%20%2811%29.png"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/AMD%20COMPUTEX%20CLIENT%20PRESS%20DECK-01-01%20%2811%29.png"></a></p>

<p>There are also a couple of points within the Zen 5 architecture where AMD has doubled up on resources or performance. L2 to L1 memory bandwidth is one such example, giving the cache hierarchy a big bandwidth boost that should allow for faster data transfers within the individual CPU cores. AMD also claims better AI performance in inferencing and AVX-512 workloads. Notably, AMD's AVX-512 support on Zen 4 was executed using a 256-bit SIMD over 2 cycles, so this may be a sign that AMD has expanded their AVX-512 SIMDs to a full 512-bits wide in the Zen 5 architecture. (Update: This has since been confirmed by AMD. Zen 5 now has a full 512-bit wide SIMD for processing AVX-512 instructions)</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/AMD%20COMPUTEX%20CLIENT%20PRESS%20DECK-01-01%20%2812%29.png"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/AMD%20COMPUTEX%20CLIENT%20PRESS%20DECK-01-01%20%2812%29.png"></a></p>

<p>These enhancements collectively aim to deliver significant performance gains over the previous Zen 4 microarchitecture, with AMD touting an average (geomean) 16% IPC uplift over Zen 4 in desktop workloads. It should be noted, however, that the top result in this benchmark collection is in the GeekBench 5.3 AES XTS benchmark, which leverages the VAES512 and VAES256 extensions of the AVX-512 instruction set. So AMD's AVX-512 SIMD changes greatly impact that benchmark in particular (though not exclusively).</p>

<p>Above is a render of a Ryzen 9000 series chip with two core complex dies (CCDs), which depicts the silicon's composition and layout. As with previous generations of Ryzen processors, there's a large central I/O die (IOD), through which all I/O and memory operations are routed. As for the CCDs, each die once again contains 8 CPU cores, with AMD equipping Ryzen chips with either 1 or 2 CCDs depending on the SKU. The new Zen 5 CCDs are being fabbed on one of TSMC's 4nm processes (AMD hasn't confirmed which flavor), which is a modest shrink from the N5 process used for Zen 4 CCDs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, although AMD hasn't confirmed that they're reusing the Ryzen 7000 series IOD here, all signs currently point to the Ryzen 9000 IOD being similar or identical to it. In particular, it is fabbed on the same TSMC N6 process, with the same 2 RDNA graphics CUs, and it offers the exact same off-chip I/O capabilities (though the latter is admittedly also dictated by the AM5 socket).</p>

<p>AMD's Ryzen 9000 chips will also feature similar memory support as their predecessors, with AMD sticking to DDR5. However, AMD does note that the incoming X870E and X870 motherboard chipsets will allow for faster EXPO memory profiles than seen on Zen 4. <s>As it stands, AMD hasn't disclosed the JEDEC memory specification of the four Ryzen 9000 SKUs that it announced today. However, we expect to find out more before the July 2024 launch of the Ryzen 9000 family.</s> And according to AMD's product pages posted since the keynote, the Ryzen 9000 family will top out at JEDEC DDR5-5600 speeds for in-warranty configurations.</p>

<p>The announcement of Zen 5 for desktop by AMD and the impending Ryzen 9000 offers four X-series SKUs at launch, allowing for overclocking and coming with unlocked CPU multipliers. The flagship SKU, the Ryzen 9 9950X, features 16 cores, a max boost clock of up to 5.7 GHz, 80 MB of cache split between 64 MB for the L3 and 16 MB for the L2 (1 MB per core of L2) and a 170 W TDP. The Ryzen 9 9900X offers 12 cores, a max boost clock of up to 5.6 GHz, 64 MB of L3 cache, and a 120 W TDP.</p>

<p>Moving down the Ryzen 9000 stack is the Ryzen 7 9700X, which comes with 8 cores, a max boost clock of up to 5.5 GHz, 32 MB of L3 cache, and a 65W TDP. Finally, the entry-level SKU, the Ryzen 5 9600X, has just 6 cores, a max boost clock of up to 5.4 GHz, 32 MB of L3 cache, and a 65 W TDP.</p>

<p>The next slide denotes the flagship Zen 5 chip. The Ryzen 9 9950X is up against Intel's current 14th Gen Core i9-14900K. In productivity and content creation tasks, the Ryzen 9 9950X shows a 7% improvement in Procyon Office, a 10% increase in Puget Photoshop, and a 21% uplift in Cinebench R24 nT. More notably, it exhibits a 55% performance boost in Handbrake and a 56% increase in Blender.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the gaming data shows marginal gains in some titles, although it highlights more significant uplifts in others. AMD's in-house testing shows that the Ryzen 9 9950X outperforms the Intel Core i9-14900K by 4% in Borderlands 3, 6% in Hitman 3, and 13% in Cyberpunk 2077. Further, it achieves a 16% improvement in F1 2023, a 17% gain in DOTA 2, and a 23% increase in Horizon Zero Dawn.</p>

<p>As we've mentioned, AMD is committed to extending its AM5 socket for longevity, at least much more than other vendors offer with their CPU launches and updates. As such, AMD's Ryzen 9000 series operates on the current AM5 platform. And while Ryzen 9000 is fully backwards compatible with existing 600 series boards, AMD has also readied two new 800 series motherboard chipsets for the launch of Zen 5 on desktops. The X870E (extreme) and X870 chipsets will be featured on numerous new motherboards at launch, and a big part of Computex this week will be the motherboard vendors (most of whom are local Taiwanese firms) showing off their new wares.</p>

<p>AMD has offered just a handful of details about their X870E and X870 chipsets. Of particular note, USB 4.0 support is going to be standard on all X870(E) motherboards, whereas it was optional on X670(E) series boards. X870(E) boards will also feature Wi-Fi 7 support (up from 6E on the 600 series), and at least one PCIe 5.0 NVMe slot continues to be mandatory. AMD also notes that motherboards based on both platforms "feature 44 total PCIe lanes," which would break down as 24 lanes from the CPU, and another 20 lanes coming from the chipset.</p>

<p>For the moment, different AMD resources are in conflict with each other about PCIe 5.0 – or, at least, aren't being very clear about it. According to <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/chipsets/am5.html#specs">AMD's AM5 chipset page</a>, both X870 and X870E feature PCie 5.0 for both the CPU NVMe lanes and CPU PEG lanes. However AMD's Compute press release states that X870E is "differentiated with 24 PCIe 5.0 lanes, with 16 lanes dedicated to graphics," implying that the vanilla X870 won't mandate PCIe 5.0 support. We're poking around AMD and the motherboard vendors to find out more.</p>

<p>Looking under the hood, AMD has confirmed that the new chipsets aren't based on new silicon. Instead, the company is using the same ASMedia-produced design as in the X670/B650 chipsets: the Promontory 21 controller. Given that the feature sets of the newer X870E/X870 motherboards are fundamentally similar to those of the X670E/X670 motherboards, aside from using newer external controllers such as Wi-Fi 7, there's apparently little need to change the chipset itself. Though given the lack of significant changes, it does raise the question of why AMD has skipped a generation in its nomenclature (700-series anyone?) and went straight to the 800-series chipset.</p>
