				<p>With agentic AI embedded at the OS level, databases storing entire digital lives accessible to malware, tasks whose reliability quickly breaks down at each step, and being opted-in without consent, Signal leadership is sounding the alarm for the industry to pull back until threats can be mitigated.</p>				
				
<p>At the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/">39th Chaos Communication Congress</a> (39C3) in Hamburg, Germany, Signal President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meredith_Whittaker">Meredith Whittaker</a> and VP of Strategy and Global Affairs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/udbhav-tiwari-b4919839/">Udbhav Tiwari</a> gave a presentation titled <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-ai-agent-ai-spy#t=2374">AI Agent, AI Spy</a>. In it, they shared the many vulnerabilities and concerns they have about how agentic AI is being implemented, the very real threat it’s bringing to enterprise companies, and how they recommend the industry change to mitigate a disaster in the making.</p>

<p>A key component of AI agents is that they must know enough about you and have access to sensitive data so that they can autonomously take actions on your behalf, such as making purchases, scheduling events, and responding to messages. However, <strong>the way AI agents are being implemented is making them insecure, unreliable, and open to surveillance</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-ai-agents-are-vulnerable-to-threats">How AI agents are vulnerable to threats</h2>



<p>Microsoft is trying to bring agentic AI to its Windows 11 users via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Recall">Recall</a>. Recall takes a screenshot of your screen every few seconds, OCRs the text, and does semantic analysis of the context and actions. It then creates a forensic dossier of everything you do into a single database on your computer. The database includes a precise timeline of actions, full raw text (via OCR), dwell time, and focus on specific apps and actions. Additionally, it assigns topics to specific activities.</p>



<p><strong>Tiwari says the problem with this approach is that it doesn’t mitigate the threat of malware (via online attacks) and indirect (hidden) prompt injection attacks, which can all gain access to the database.</strong> These vulnerabilities subsequently circumvent end-to-end encryption (E2EE), prompting Signal to add a flag in its app to prevent its screen from being recorded, but Tiwari says that’s not a reliable or long-term solution.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-complex-agentic-tasks-aren-t-reliable">Why complex agentic tasks aren’t reliable</h2>



<p>Whittaker emphasized that agentic AI isn’t just intrusive and vulnerable to threats; it’s also unreliable. She said <strong>AI agents are probabilistic, not deterministic, and that each step they take in a task degrades their accuracy and the final action</strong>.</p>



<p>She said if an AI agent could perform each step with 95% accuracy–which currently isn’t possible–a 10-step task would yield an action with a ~59.9% success rate. And if you had a 30-step task, the success rate would be ~21.4%. Furthermore, if we used a more realistic accuracy rate of 90%, then a 30-step task would drop down to a success rate of 4.2%. She added that <strong>the best agent models failed 70% of the time</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-make-ai-agents-private-and-secure">How to make AI agents private and secure</h2>



<p><strong>Whittaker said there currently isn’t a solution for making AI agents preserve privacy, security, and control; there’s only triage</strong>, but companies can take steps now to mitigate it.</p>



<ol>
<li>Stop the reckless deployment of AI agents to avoid plain-text database access to malware.</li>



<li>Make opting out the default, with mandatory developer opt-ins.</li>



<li>AI companies must provide radical (or any) transparency about how everything works and make it auditable at the granular level.</li>
</ol>



<p>If the industry doesn’t heed Whittaker’s and Tiwari’s warnings, the age of agentic AI could be in jeopardy, primarily because consumers could quickly lose their trust in a technology that is already overhyped and over-invested in.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Happy New Year, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/bandcamp">r/bandcamp</a>!</p>

<p>Hope you all enjoyed the Holiday Guide (<a href="http://bandcamp.com/2025">bandcamp.com/2025</a>) and your 2025 Bandcamp recaps.</p>

<p>Something that always strikes us as we put together a roundup like this is the sheer quantity of human creativity and passion that artists express on Bandcamp every single day. The fact that Bandcamp is home to such a vibrant community of real people making incredible music is something we want to protect and maintain.    </p>

<p>Today, in line with that goal, we’re articulating our policy on generative AI. We want musicians to keep making music, and for fans to have confidence that the music they find on Bandcamp was created by humans.</p>

<p>Our guidelines for generative AI in music and audio are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Music and audio that is generated wholly or in substantial part by AI is <strong>not permitted</strong> on Bandcamp.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Any use of AI tools to impersonate other artists or styles is <strong>strictly prohibited</strong> in accordance with our existing policies prohibiting impersonation and intellectual property infringement.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you encounter music or audio that appears to be made entirely or with heavy reliance on generative AI, please use our reporting tools to flag the content for review by our team<strong>. We reserve the right to remove any music on suspicion of being AI generated.</strong></p>

<p>We will be sure to communicate any updates to the policy as the rapidly changing generative AI space develops. Given the response around this to our previous posts, we hope this news is welcomed. We wish you all an amazing 2026.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

His father, Leon Wildes, who started the firm in 1960, defended John Lennon and Yoko Ono against deportation during the Nixon administration, and helped facilitate the creation of the O-1B visa, which was established by the Immigration Act of 1990. Wildes’s client roster now includes social media influencers and Twitch streamers.</p><p>To qualify for an O-1B visa, applicants must submit evidence of at least three of the six <a href="https://www.wildeslaw.com/misc-content/foreigners-with-extraordinary-ability-the-o-1-visa/" data-link-name="in body link">regulatory criteria</a>, which include performing in a distinguished production or event, national or international recognition for achievements, and a record of commercial or critically acclaimed successes.

Israeli chess player and content creator – which was approved in December 2023.</p><p>“My followings on Instagram (1.2 million), Twitch (108,000) and YouTube (799,000) were included as part of my profile, and I listed my follower counts on each platform,” she said. After her visa approval, she moved to Charlotte, North Carolina – widely considered the chess capital of the United States.</p><p>While a certain number of followers may not be an automatic ticket to the US, one viral music group has been trying their luck. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@boy.throb" data-link-name="in body link">Boy Throb</a>, comprising Anthony Key, Evan Papier, Zachary Sobania and Darshan Magdum, spent the past few months campaigning to reach 1 million followers on TikTok so that Magdum could use the stat on his O-1 visa application. Clad in matching pink jumpsuits, the three US-based bandmates danced together on screen to parody lyrics of hit songs, while Magdum was edited in from India.</p><p>Within a month of their first post, Boy Throb <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/is-boy-throb-real-or-fake-meet-the-divisive-boy-band-visa-issues-interview" data-link-name="in body link">reached their goal of 1 million followers.</a> Whether it will help Magdum get a visa remains unclear.</p><p>“Honestly, the entire immigration process has been so complicated and there have been so many people who don’t believe us when we say we’re doing everything in our power to get Darshan here,” the group said.</p><p>“We’re not sure how much longer we want to keep going without Darshan here and the process has been really expensive,” they added. In total, the band has spent more than $10,000 in legal and processing fees.</p><p>The rise in content creators applying for visas given out on the basis of “extraordinary ability” has garnered a variety of reactions. Dominic Michael Tripi, a political analyst and writer, <a href="https://x.com/DMichaelTripi/status/2008237290943041601?s=20" data-link-name="in body link">posted on X </a>that the trend was indicative of “end-stage empire conditions. It’s sad.” Legal professionals like Wildes, however, argue that the creator economy is the next frontier of American exceptionalism.</p><p>“Influencers are filling a large gap in the retail and commercial interests of the world,” he said. “They’re moving content and purchases like no other. Immigration has to keep up with this.”</p><figure id="386712dc-ffdd-4915-a17f-b6b6df105461" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/737f45d7ac0b1556995c8dab859a87b2cd4a97f0/0_0_1200_960/master/1200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/737f45d7ac0b1556995c8dab859a87b2cd4a97f0/0_0_1200_960/master/1200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/737f45d7ac0b1556995c8dab859a87b2cd4a97f0/0_0_1200_960/master/1200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/737f45d7ac0b1556995c8dab859a87b2cd4a97f0/0_0_1200_960/master/1200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/737f45d7ac0b1556995c8dab859a87b2cd4a97f0/0_0_1200_960/master/1200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/737f45d7ac0b1556995c8dab859a87b2cd4a97f0/0_0_1200_960/master/1200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="two women side by side " src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/737f45d7ac0b1556995c8dab859a87b2cd4a97f0/0_0_1200_960/master/1200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="356" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Julia Ain and Dina Belenkaya</span> Photograph: Courtesy of Julia Ain and  Dina Belenkaya</figcaption></figure><p>Ain also takes issue with the criticism of influencers applying for O-1 visas, as well as the notion that influencing is not a legitimate profession.</p><p>“I don’t think [people] realize how much work actually goes into it,” she said. “You might not agree with the way the money is being made, or what people are watching, but people are still watching and paying for it.”</p><p>She continued: “Maybe 50 years ago, this isn’t what people imagined the American dream would look like.

                <section>
                    <div>
                        <p>Throughout 2025, I spoke a few times about our home energy solution, including our grid usage, our solar array and our Tesla Powerwall batteries. Now that I have a full year of data, I wanted to take a look at exactly how everything is working out, and, in alignment with our objectives, how much money we've saved!</p><h4 id="our-setup">Our setup</h4><p>Just to give a quick overview of what we're working with, here are the details on our solar, battery and tariff situation:</p><ul><li>☀️Solar Panels: We have 14x Perlight solar panels managed by Enphase that make up the 4.2kWp array on our roof, and they produce energy when the sun shines, which isn't as often as I'd like in the UK!</li><li>🔋Tesla Powerwalls: We have 3x Tesla Powerwall 2 in our garage that were purchased to help us load-shift our energy usage. Electricity is very expensive in the UK and moving from peak usage which is 05:30 to 23:30 at ~£0.28/kWh, to off-peak usage, which is 23:30 - 05:30 at ~£0.07/kWh, is a significant cost saving.</li><li>💡Smart Tariff: My wife and I both drive electric cars and our electricity provider, Octopus Energy, has a Smart Charging tariff. If we plug in one of our cars, and cheap electricity is available, they will activate the charger and allow us to use the off-peak rate, even at peak times.</li></ul><p>Now that we have some basic info, let's get into the details!</p><h4 id="grid-import">Grid Import</h4><p>I have 3 sources of data for our grid import, and all of them align pretty well in terms of their measurements. I have the amount our electricity supplier charged us for, I have my own CT Clamp going via a Shelly EM that feeds in to Home Assistant, and I have the Tesla Gateway which controls all grid import into our home.</p><p>Starting with my Home Assistant data, these are the relevant readings. </p><p>Jan 1st 2025 - 15,106.10 kWh<br>Dec 31st 2025 - 36,680.90 kWh<br>Total: 21,574.80 kWh<br><strong>Total Import: 21.6 MWh</strong></p><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1138" height="503" srcset="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/image-3.png 600w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/image-3.png 1000w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-3.png 1138w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>As you can see in the graph, during the summer months we have slightly lower grid usage and the graph line climbs at a lower rate, but overall, we have pretty consistent usage. Looking at what our energy supplier charged, us for, that comes in slightly lower.</p><p><strong>Total Import: 20.1 MWh</strong></p><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-8.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="997" height="577" srcset="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/image-8.png 600w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-8.png 997w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I'm going to use the figure provided by our energy supplier in my calculations because their equipment is likely more accurate than mine, and also, what they're charging me is the ultimate thing that matters. The final source is our Tesla Gateway, which shows us having imported 21.0 MWh.</p><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-11.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1290" height="1568" srcset="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/image-11.png 600w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/image-11.png 1000w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-11.png 1290w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>It's great to see how all of these sources of data align so poorly! 😅</p><h4 id="grid-export">Grid Export</h4><p>Looking at our export, the graph tells a slightly different story because, as you can see, we didn't really start exporting properly until June, when our export tariff was activated. Prior to June, it simply wasn't worth exporting as we were only getting £0.04/kWh but at the end of May, our export tariff went live and we were then getting paid £0.15/kWh for export. My <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/automation-improvements-after-a-tesla-powerwall-outage/?ref=scotthelme.co.uk" rel="noreferrer">first</a> and <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/v2-hacking-my-tesla-powerwalls-to-be-the-ultimate-home-energy-solution/?ref=scotthelme.co.uk" rel="noreferrer">second</a> blog posts cover the full details of this change when it happened if you'd like to read them but for now, just note that it will change the calculations a little later as we only had export for 60% of the year.</p><p><strong>Total Export: 6.0 MWh</strong></p><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-9.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="989" height="582" srcset="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/image-9.png 600w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-9.png 989w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>With our grid export covered the final piece of the puzzle is to look at our solar.</p><h4 id="solar-production">Solar Production</h4><p>We're really not in the best part of the world for generating solar power, but we've still managed to produce quite a bit of power. Even in the most ideal, perfect scenario, our solar array can only generate 4.2kW of power, and we're definitely never getting near that. Our peak production was 2.841kW on 8th July at 13:00, and you can see our full annual production graph here. </p><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-12.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1582" height="513" srcset="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/image-12.png 600w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/image-12.png 1000w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-12.png 1582w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Looking at the total energy production for the entire array, you can see it pick up through the sunnier months but remain quite flat during the darker days of the year.</p><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1132" height="504" srcset="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/image-2.png 600w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/image-2.png 1000w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-2.png 1132w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Jan 1st 2025 - 2.709 MWh<br>Dec 31st 2025 - 5.874 MWh<br><strong>Solar Production: 3.2 MWh</strong></p><p>Just to confirm, I also took a look at the Enphase app, which is drawing it's data from the same source to be fair, and it agrees with the 3.2 MWh of generation.</p><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1157" height="560" srcset="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/image-4.png 600w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/image-4.png 1000w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-4.png 1157w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h4 id="calculating-the-savings">Calculating the savings</h4><p>This isn't exactly straightforward because of the combination of our solar array and excess import/export due to the batteries, but here are the numbers I'm currently working on.</p><p><strong>Total Import: 20.1 MWh<br>Total Export: 6.0 MWh<br>Solar Production: 3.2 MWh</strong></p><p>That gives us a total household usage of 17.3 MWh.</p><p>(20.1 MWh import + 3.2 MWh solar) − 6.0 MWh export = 17.3 MWh usage</p><p>If we didn't have the solar array providing power, the full 17.3 MWh of consumption would have been chargeable from our provider. If we had only the solar and no battery, assuming a perfect ability to utilise our solar generation, only 14.1 MWh of our usage would need to be imported. The cost of those units of solar generation can be viewed at the peak and off-peak rates as follows.</p><p>Peak rate: 3,200 kWh x £0.28/kWh = £896<br>Off-peak rate: 3,200 kWh x £0.07/kWh = £224</p><p>Given that solar panels only produce during peak electricity rates, it would be reasonable to use the higher price here. A consideration for us though is that we do have batteries, and we're able to load-shift all of our usage into the off-peak rate, so arguably the solar panels only made £224 of electricity. </p><p>The bigger savings come when we start to look at the cost of the grid import. Assuming we had no solar panels, we'd have imported 17.3 MWh of electricity, and with the solar panels and perfect utilisation, we'd have imported 14.1 MWh of electricity. That's quite a lot of electricity and calculating the different costs of peak vs. off-peak by using batteries to load shift our usage gives some quite impressive results.</p><p>Peak rate: 17,300 kWh x £0.28/kWh = £4,844<br>Peak rate with solar: 14,100 kWh x £0.28 = £3,948</p><p>Off-peak rate: 17,300 kWh x £0.07/kWh = £1,211<br>Off-peak rate with solar: 14,100 kWh x £0.07/kWh = £987</p><p>This means there's a potential swing from £4,844 down to £987 with solar and battery, a total potential saving of £3,857!</p><p>This also tracks if we look at our monthly spend on electricity which went from £350-£400 per month down to £50-£100 per month depending on the time of year. But it gets better.</p><h4 id="exporting-excess-energy">Exporting excess energy</h4><p>Our solar array generates almost nothing in the winter months so our batteries are sized to allow for a full day of usage with basically no solar support. We can go from the start of the peak rate at 05:30 all the way to the off-peak rate at 23:30 without using any grid power. When it comes to the summer months, though, our solar array is producing a lot of power and we clearly have a capability to export a lot more. The batteries can fill up on the off-peak rate overnight at £0.07/kWh, and then export it during the peak rate for £0.15/kWh, meaning any excess solar production or battery capacity can be exported for a reasonable amount.</p><p>If we take a look at the billing information from our energy supplier, we can see that during July, our best month for solar production, we exported a lot of energy. We exported so much energy that it actually fully offset our electricity costs and allowed us to go negative, meaning we were earning money back.</p><p>Here is our electricity import data:</p><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-7.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="988" height="623" srcset="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/image-7.png 600w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-7.png 988w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>And here is our electricity export data:</p><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-6.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="983" height="706" srcset="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/image-6.png 600w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-6.png 983w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>That's a pretty epic scenario, despite us being such high energy consumers, to still have the ability to full cover our costs and even earn something back! For clarity, we will still have the standing charge component of our bill, which is £0.45/day so about £13.50 per month to go on any given month, but looking at the raw energy costs, it's impressive.</p><h4 id="the-final-calculation">The final calculation</h4><p>I pulled all of our charges for electricity in 2025 to see just how close my calculations were and to double check everything I was thinking. Earlier, I gave these figures:</p><p>Off-peak rate: 17,300 kWh x £0.07/kWh = £1,211</p><p>If 100% of our electricity usage was at the off-peak rate, we should have paid £1,211 for the year. Adding up all of our monthly charges, our total for the year was £1,608.11 all in, but we need to subtract our standing charge from that.</p><p>Total cost = £1,608.11 - (365 * £0.45)<br><strong>Total import = £1,443.86</strong></p><p>This means that we got almost all of our usage at the off-peak rate which is an awesome achievement! After the charges for electricity, I then tallied up all of our payments for export.</p><p><strong>Total export = £886.49</strong></p><p>Another pretty impressive achievement, earning so much in export, which also helps to bring our net electricity cost in 2025 to <strong>£557.37</strong>! To put this another way, the effective rate of our electricity is now just £0.03/kWh.</p><p>£557.37 / 17,300kWh = <strong>£0.03/kWh</strong></p><h4 id="but-was-it-all-worth-it">But was it all worth it?</h4><p>That's a tricky question to answer, and everyone will have different objectives and desired outcomes, but ours was pretty clear. Running two Electric Vehicles, having two adults working from home full time, me having servers and equipment at home, along with a power hungry hot tub, we were spending too much per month in electricity alone, and our goal was to reduce that.</p><p>Of course, it only makes sense to spend money reducing our costs if we reduce them enough to pay back the investment in the long term, and things are looking good so far. Here are the costs for our installations:</p><p>£17,580 - Powerwalls #1 and #2 installed.<br>£13,940 - Solar array installed.<br>£7,840  - Powerwall #3 installed.<br>Total cost = £39,360</p><p>If we assume even a generous 2/3 - 1/3 split between peak and off-peak usage, with no Powerwalls or solar array, our electricity costs for 2025 would have been £3,632.86:</p><p>11,533 kWh x £0.28/kWh = £3,229.24<br>5,766 kWh x £0.07/kWh = £403.62<br>Total = £3,632.86</p><p>Instead, our costs were only £557.37, meaning we saved £3,078.49 this year. We also only had export capabilities for 7 months of 2025, so in 2026 when we will have 12 months of export capabilities, we should further reduce our costs. I anticipate that in 2026 our electricity costs for the year will be ~£0, and that's our goal.</p><p>Having our full costs returned in ~11 years is definitely something we're happy with, and we've also had protection against several power outages in our area along the way, which is a very nice bonus. Another way to look at this is that the investment is returning ~9%/year.</p><table>

<p>Of course, at some point during that period, the effective value of the installation will reduce to almost £0, and we have to consider that, but it's doing pretty darn good. If we hadn't needed to add that third Powerwall, this would have been so much better too. We'll see what the future holds, but with the inevitable and continued rise of energy costs, and talk of moving the standing charge on to our unit rate, things might look even better in the future.</p><h4 id="onwards-to-2026">Onwards to 2026!</h4><p>Now that we have everything properly set up, and I'm happy with all of our Home Assistant automations, we're going to see how 2026 goes. I will definitely circle back in a year from now and see how the numbers played out, and until then, I hope the information here has been useful or interesting 👍</p>

        <div>Intuitive touch controls make it even easier to create desktop-class designs wherever users take their iPad. The full-featured Layers sidebar allows creators to build designs using a range of unique elements like images, shapes, text, and even video. Smart selection tools help users isolate and edit specific parts of images effortlessly, and with advanced bitmap and vector masks, users can hide or reveal discrete portions of their designs. The deep integration of hardware, software, and Apple silicon unlocks features like Super Resolution for intelligently upscaling photos, Deband for removing compression artifacts, and automatic composition suggestions with Auto Crop. With full support for Apple Pencil, digital artists can enjoy painting in the most natural way with a beautiful collection of pressure-sensitive brushes. And unmatched Apple Pencil precision — combined with features like hover,<sup>9</sup> squeeze,<sup>10</sup> and double-tap<sup>11</sup> — gives creators the ability to craft pixel-perfect designs.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We do this to our philosophies. We redraft their contours based on projected shadows, or give them a cartoonish shape like a caricaturist emphasising all the wrong features. This is how Buddhism becomes, in the popular imagination, a doctrine of passivity and even laziness, while Existentialism becomes synonymous with apathy and futile despair. Something similar has happened to Stoicism, which is considered – when considered at all – a philosophy of grim endurance, of carrying on rather than getting over, of tolerating rather than transcending life’s agonies and adversities.</p>
<p>No wonder it’s not more popular. No wonder the Stoic sage, in Western culture, has never obtained the popularity of the Zen master. Even though Stoicism is far more accessible, not only does it lack the exotic mystique of Eastern practice; it’s also regarded as a philosophy of merely breaking even while remaining determinedly impassive. What this attitude ignores is the promise proffered by Stoicism of lasting transcendence and imperturbable tranquility.</p>
<p>It ignores gratitude, too. This is part of the tranquility, because it’s what makes the tranquility possible. Stoicism is, as much as anything, a philosophy of gratitude – and a gratitude, moreover, rugged enough to endure anything. Philosophers who pine for supreme psychological liberation have often failed to realise that they belong to a confederacy that includes the Stoics. ‘According to nature you want to <em>live</em>?’ Friedrich Nietzsche taunts the Stoics in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> (1886):</p>
<blockquote>O you noble Stoics, what deceptive words these are! Imagine a being like nature, wasteful beyond measure, indifferent beyond measure, without purposes and consideration, without mercy and justice, fertile and desolate and uncertain at the same time; imagine indifference itself as a power – how <em>could </em>you live according to this indifference? Living – is that not precisely wanting to be other than this nature? Is not living – estimating, preferring, being unjust, being limited, wanting to be different? And supposing your imperative ‘live according to nature’ meant at bottom as much as ‘live according to life’ – how could you <em>not </em>do that? Why make a principle of what you yourself are and must be?</blockquote>
<p>This is pretty good, as denunciations of Stoicism go, seductive in its articulateness and energy, and therefore effective, however uninformed.</p>
<p>Which is why it’s so disheartening to see Nietzsche fly off the rails of sanity in the next two paragraphs, accusing the Stoics of trying to ‘impose’ their ‘morality… on nature’, of being ‘no longer able to see [nature] differently’ because of an ‘arrogant’ determination to ‘tyrannise’ nature as the Stoic has tyrannised himself. Then (in some of the least subtle psychological projection you’re ever likely to see, given what we know of Nietzsche’s mad drive for psychological supremacy), he accuses all of philosophy as being a ‘tyrannical drive’, ‘the most spiritual will to power’, to the ‘creation of the world’.</p>
<p>The truth is, indifference really <em>is</em> a power, selectively applied, and living in such a way is not only eminently possible, with a conscious adoption of certain attitudes, but facilitates a freer, more expansive, more adventurous mode of living. Joy and grief are still there, along with all the other emotions, but they are tempered – and, in their temperance, they are less tyrannical.</p>
<p><span>I</span>f we can’t always go to our philosophers for an understanding of Stoicism, then where <em>can </em>we go? One place to start is the<em> Urban Dictionary</em>. Check out what this crowdsourced online reference to slang gives as the definition of a ‘stoic’:</p>
<blockquote> <strong>stoic</strong><br>Someone who does not give a shit about the stupid things in this world that most people care so much about. Stoics do have emotions, but only for the things in this world that really matter. They are the most real people alive.<br><em>Group of kids are sitting on a porch. Stoic walks by.</em><br><em>Kid – ‘Hey man, yur a fuckin faggot an you suck cock!’</em><br><em>Stoic – ‘Good for you.’</em><br><em>Keeps going.</em> </blockquote>
<p>You’ve gotta love the way the author manages to make mention of a porch in there, because Stoicism has its root in the word <em>stoa</em>, which is the Greek name for what today we would call a porch. Actually, we’re more likely to call it a portico, but the ancient Stoics used it as a kind of porch, where they would hang out and talk about enlightenment and stuff. The Greek scholar Zeno is the founder, and the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius the most famous practitioner, while the Roman statesman Seneca is probably the most eloquent and entertaining. But the real hero of Stoicism, most Stoics agree, is the Greek philosopher Epictetus.</p>
<p>He’d been a slave, which gives his words a credibility that the other Stoics, for all the hardships they endured, can’t quite match. He spoke to his pupils, who later wrote down his words. These are the only words we know today as Epictetus’, consisting of two short works, the <em>Enchiridion </em>and the <em>Discourses</em>, along with some fragments. Among those whom Epictetus taught directly is Marcus Aurelius (another Stoic philosopher who did not necessarily expect to be read; his <em>Meditations </em>were written expressly for private benefit, as a kind of self-instruction).</p>
<p>Among those Epictetus has taught <em>indirectly</em> is a whole cast of the distinguished, in all fields of endeavour. One of these is the late US Navy Admiral James Stockdale. A prisoner of war in Vietnam for seven years during that conflict, he endured broken bones, starvation, solitary confinement, and all other manner of torture. His psychological companion through it all were the teachings of Epictetus, with which he had familiarised himself after graduating from college and joining the Navy, studying philosophy at Stanford University on the side. He kept those teachings close by in Vietnam, never letting them leave his mind even when things were at their most dire. Especially then. He knew what they were about, those lessons, and he came to know their application much better than anyone should have to.</p>
<p>Stockdale wrote a lot about Epictetus, in speeches and memoirs and essays, but if you want to travel light (and, really, what Stoic doesn’t?), the best thing you could take with you is a speech he gave at King’s College London in 1993, published as <em>Courage Under Fire: Testing Epictetus’s Doctrines in a Laboratory of Human Behavior</em> (1993). That subtitle is important. Epictetus once compared the philosopher’s lecture room to a hospital, from which the student should walk out in a little bit of pain. ‘If Epictetus’s lecture room was a hospital,’ Stockdale writes, ‘my prison was a laboratory – a laboratory of human behaviour. I chose to test his postulates against the demanding real-life challenges of my laboratory. And as you can tell, I think he passed with flying colours.’</p>
<p>‘You are unfortunate in my judgment, for you have never been unfortunate’</p>
<p>Stockdale rejected the false optimism proffered by Christianity, because he knew, from direct observation, that false hope is how you went insane in that prison. The Stoics themselves believed in gods, but ultimately those resistant to religious belief can take their Stoicism the way they take their Buddhism, even if they can’t buy into such concepts as karma or reincarnation. What the whole thing comes down to, distilled to its briefest essence, is making the choice that choice is really all we have, and that all else is not worth considering. ‘Who […] is the invincible human being?’ Epictetus once asked, before answering the question himself: ‘One who can be disconcerted by nothing that lies outside the sphere of choice.’</p>
<p>Any misfortune ‘that lies outside the sphere of choice’ should be considered an opportunity to strengthen our resolve, not an excuse to weaken it. This is one of the truly great mind-hacks ever devised, this willingness to convert adversity to opportunity, and it’s part of what Seneca was extolling when he wrote what he would say to one whose spirit has never been tempered or tested by hardship: ‘You are unfortunate in my judgment, for you have never been unfortunate. You have passed through life with no antagonist to face you; no one will know what you were capable of, not even you yourself.’ We do ourselves an immense favour when we consider adversity an opportunity to make this discovery – and, in the discovery, to enhance what we find there.</p>
<p>Another shrewdly resourceful Stoic mind-hack is what William B Irvine – in his book <em>A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy­</em> (2009)– has given the name ‘negative visualisation’. By keeping the very worst that can happen in our heads constantly, the Stoics tell us, we immunise ourselves from the dangers of too much so-called ‘positive thinking’, a product of the mind that believes a realistic accounting of the world can lead only to despair. Only by envisioning the bad can we truly appreciate the good; gratitude does not arrive when we take things for granted. It’s precisely this gratitude that leaves us content to cede control of what the world has already removed from our control anyway.</p>
<p>How did we let something so eminently understandable become so grotesquely misunderstood? How did we forget that that dark passage is really the portal to transcendence?</p>
<p><span>M</span>any will recognise in these principles the general shape and texture of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Indeed, Stoicism has been identified as a kind of proto-CBT. Albert Ellis, the US psychologist who founded an early form of CBT known as Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy (REBT) in 1955, had read the Stoics in his youth and used to prescribe to his patients Epictetus’s maxim that ‘People are disturbed not by things but by their view of things.’ ‘That’s actually the “cognitive model of emotion” in a nutshell,’ Donald Robertson tells me, and he should certainly know, as a therapist who in 2010 wrote a book on CBT with the subtitle ‘Stoic Philosophy as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy’.</p>
<p>This simplicity and accessibility ensure that Stoicism will never be properly embraced by those who prefer the abstracted and esoteric in their philosophies. In the novel <em>A Man in Full</em> (1998), Tom Wolfe gives Stoicism, with perfect plausibility, to a semi-literate prison inmate. This monologue of Conrad Hensley’s may be stilted, but there’s nothing at all suspect about the sentiment behind it. When asked if he is a Stoic, Conrad replies: ‘I’m just reading about it, but I wish there was somebody around today, somebody you could go to, the way students went to Epictetus. Today people think of Stoics – like, you know, like they’re people who grit their teeth and tolerate pain and suffering. What they are is, they’re serene and confident in the face of anything you can throw at them.’</p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius started each day telling himself: ‘I shall meet with meddling, ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, and unsociable people’</p>
<p>Which leads us naturally to ask just what it was that was thrown at them. We’ve already noted that Epictetus had the whole slavery thing going on, so he checks out. So does Seneca, in spite of what many have asserted – most recently the UK classicist Mary Beard in an essay for the <em>New York Review of Books</em> that asks: ‘How Stoical Was Seneca?’ before providing a none-too-approving answer. What Beard’s well-informed and otherwise cogent essay fails to allow for is just how tough it must have been for Seneca – tubercular, exiled, and under the control of a sadistically murderous dictator – no matter what access he sometimes had to life’s luxuries. It was Seneca himself who said that ‘no one has condemned wisdom to poverty’, and only an Ancient Greek Cynic would try to deny this. Besides, Seneca would have been the first to tell you, as he told a correspondent in one of his letters: ‘I am not so shameless as to undertake to cure my fellow-men when I am ill myself. I am, however, discussing with you troubles which concern us both, and sharing the remedy with you, just as if we were lying ill in the same hospital.’</p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius lay ill in that hospital, too. As beneficiary of the privileges of emperor, he also endured the struggles and stresses of that very same position, plus a few more besides. I know better than to try to improve on the following accounting, provided in Irvine’s <em>A Guide to the Good Life</em>:</p>
<blockquote>He was sick, possibly with an ulcer. His family life was a source of distress: his wife appears to have been unfaithful to him, and of the at least 14 children she bore him, only six survived. Added to this were the stresses that came with ruling an empire. During his reign, there were numerous frontier uprisings, and Marcus often went personally to oversee campaigns against upstart tribes. His own officials – most notably, Avidius Cassius, the governor of Syria – rebelled against him. His subordinates were insolent to him, which insolence he bore with ‘an unruffled temper’. Citizens told jokes at his expense and were not punished for doing so. During his reign, the empire also experienced plague, famine, and natural disasters such as the earthquake at Smyrna.</blockquote>
<p>Ever the strategist, Marcus employed a trusty technique in confronting the days that comprised such a life, making a point to tell himself at the start of each one of them: ‘I shall meet with meddling, ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, and unsociable people.’ He could have been different about it – he could have pretended things were just hunky-dory, especially on those days when they really were, or seemed to be. But how, then, would he have been prepared to angle both into the wind and away from it – adapting, always, to fate’s violently vexing vicissitudes? Where would that have left him when the weather changed?</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Democracy rarely collapses in a single dramatic moment. Lately, however, it can feel as though those type of moments are arriving faster and more frequently, piling up in ways that leave people disoriented and unsure where to look. What often gets lost in that rush is not concern, but orientation – a shared sense of where we are, what matters, and how any of it connects.





</p><p>Long before laws are tested or elections contested, something more basic starts to fray: the everyday understanding of how our communities work and who is accountable to whom.&nbsp;





</p><p>I’ve found myself asking a simple question more often lately: <em>Where do people actually see themselves inside public life anymore?</em>

</p>





<p>That question keeps leading me back to local journalism and to why its decline should concern anyone who cares about democracy.&nbsp;





</p><p>Democracy doesn’t live only in Washington or Harrisburg. It lives in school board meetings, zoning decisions, municipal budgets, local courts, and elections that rarely make national headlines. It lives where policy meets daily life. Local journalism is how those places stay visible.&nbsp;





</p>







<p>When local reporters attend meetings most of us can’t, sift through public records, and follow issues over time, they make public life legible. They help citizens see not just <em>what</em> happened, but <em>why</em> it matters, who made the decision, and what the consequences may be. Without that work, power doesn’t disappear – it simply operates out of view.&nbsp;





</p><p>National media plays an important role, but it works at a distance.&nbsp; Democracy, however, is practiced close to home. I’ve noticed that when local reporting weakens, people don’t just lose information – they lose orientation.&nbsp; It becomes harder to tell where influence actually lives, or how individual participation connects to outcomes.&nbsp;





</p><p>What often gets labeled as apathy looks different up close. Many people I speak with aren’t indifferent; they’re resigned. They’ve absorbed the sense that nothing they do matters, or that no one is really listening. When that happens, public life shrinks.&nbsp; Engagement gives way to spectatorship, and frustration seeks expression through outrage or grievance rather than responsibility.&nbsp;





</p><p>Local journalism quietly counters that drift by doing something deceptively simple: it keeps the public in the room.&nbsp;





</p><p><strong>INTERVIEW:</strong> <a href="https://buckscountybeacon.com/2025/01/interview-solidarity-journalism-can-help-the-mainstream-media-restore-public-trust-and-strengthen-democracy-with-dr-anita-varma/">Solidarity Journalism Can Help the Mainstream Media Restore Public Trust and Strengthen Democracy, with Dr. Anita Varma</a>





</p><p>It connects decisions to real people. It shows patterns rather than isolated moments. It reminds us that our communities are not abstract – that they are shaped by named individuals, concrete choices, and shared consequences. In that way, local journalism doesn’t just report on democracy; it helps sustain it.&nbsp;





</p><p>This is also why attacks on journalism, especially local journalism,&nbsp; feel so consequential. Undermining trust in reporters, starving newsrooms of resources, or dismissing local coverage as irrelevant all serve the same end: weakening the connective tissue that allows a community to hold itself accountable.&nbsp;





</p><p>At the same time, I don’t think the responsibility for preserving local journalism rests with journalists alone.&nbsp;





</p><p>Supporting local journalism isn’t charity. It’s civic participation.&nbsp;





</p>







<p>I’ve come to see local news outlets less as content providers and more as public infrastructure – as essential to democratic functioning as schools, courts, or roads. Subscribing, donating, and sharing credible reporting are practical ways citizens invest in the health of their communities.&nbsp;





</p><p>Engagement matters, too.&nbsp;Reading beyond headlines.&nbsp;Responding thoughtfully rather than reactively.&nbsp;&nbsp;Offering tips, context, and lived experience that strengthen reporting rather than distort it.&nbsp;&nbsp;





</p><p>These are small acts, but they shape the quality of the public conversation we’re all part of.&nbsp;





</p><p><strong>READ:</strong> <a href="https://buckscountybeacon.com/2025/11/democracy-begins-where-we-live/">Democracy Begins Where We Live</a>





</p><p>Publications like <em>Bucks County Beacon</em> model what this can look like: careful reporting, transparency about sources, and a commitment to clarity over sensationalism. In a media environment driven by speed and outrage, that kind of work feels both grounded and rare.&nbsp;





</p><p>I don’t see democracy as something we inherit once and for all. I see it as something we practice – in how we speak, what we support, and whether we stay engaged when the work feels slow or imperfect.&nbsp;





</p><p>At a moment when democratic norms feel increasingly fragile, local journalism offers something quietly powerful: a shared, grounded understanding of our common life. Defending it may be one of the most practical and hopeful&nbsp;choices citizens can make.&nbsp;

<h3>Algorithms, facial recognition, and tightening protest laws signal a deepening surveillance state</h3>



<p>~  <strong><em>Blade Runner</em></strong> ~</p>



<p>The UK is expanding its use of predictive policing and surveillance, framing it as a response to crime, protest, and public safety. But the direction is clear: more monitoring, earlier intervention, and more control over dissent.</p>



<p>In early April, <em>The Guardian </em>revealed that the Ministry of Justice is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/08/uk-creating-prediction-tool-to-identify-people-most-likely-to-kill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developing a “murder prevention” system</a>. The tool aims to identify individuals judged to be at high risk of committing lethal violence, based on data drawn from multiple agencies—social care, policing, education. The government has framed the project as a research initiative to improve risk assessments and early intervention. But its underlying logic marks a shift toward ‘precrime’—managing individuals on the basis of what they might do, rather than what they’ve done.</p>



<p>The comparison to <em>Minority Report</em>—Philip K. Dick’s 1956 story, later adapted into a 2002 film—is hard to avoid. In both, people are flagged not by witnesses or evidence, but by prediction systems that turn patterns into verdicts. Dick’s vision included ‘precogs’—human oracles housed by the state—while today’s version relies on datasets and AI algorithms. In both, the future is treated as knowable, and the present is shaped around managing that future in advance.</p>

<p>Notably, overall crime rates in England and Wales have been falling for decades. According to the Office for National Statistics, <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingseptember2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incidents have dropped </a>from nearly 20 million in the mid-1990s to under 5 million in recent years. Homicide levels have followed a similar decline, with 594 recorded in the year ending March 2021—far below their peak in the early 2000s. Only 35 of those involved firearms. The relative rarity of such violence raises questions about why a predictive “murder prevention” system is being pursued now.</p>



<p>At the same time, police forces face <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/18/met-police-budget-heading-off-a-cliff-commissioner-mark-rowley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">severe financial pressure</a>. The Metropolitan Police is planning to cut 1,700 officers and staff to cover a £260 million budget gap. Other forces<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/31/policing-minister-police-forces-england-wales-challenging-cuts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> face similar cuts</a>. But rather than scaling back, policing is being reorganised—away from visible presence and toward data-driven surveillance, algorithmic profiling, and anticipatory enforcement.</p>



<p>The Crime and Policing Bill 2025 reinforces this direction. It allows police to access DVLA-held driver licence records for law enforcement purposes. While the Home Office denies any link to facial recognition, civil liberties groups have raised concerns that this access could be repurposed—effectively turning the DVLA database into a foundation for real-time identification. Combined with surveillance networks already active in shops, housing estates, and transport hubs, this lays the groundwork for a more integrated system of biometric tracking, with limited transparency or oversight. These tools are disproportionately deployed in working-class areas and are consistently shown to <a href="https://amnesty.ca/features/racial-bias-in-facial-recognition-algorithms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disproportionately </a> <a href="https://amnesty.ca/features/racial-bias-in-facial-recognition-algorithms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">misidentify Black and Brown individuals</a>.</p>



<p>In August 2024, following a series of racist attacks across England, Prime Minister Keir Starmer proposed the expanded use of live facial recognition technology (LFR) as part of the government’s response. Civil liberties groups, including Statewatch, <a href="https://www.statewatch.org/news/2024/august/uk-racist-violence-does-not-justify-proposed-expansion-of-police-surveillance-technology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">condemned the move</a>, warning that it would further entrench surveillance and racialised policing. In an open letter, over two dozen organisations <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/02/starmer-live-facial-recognition-plan-would-usher-in-national-id-campaigners-warn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued that the UK risks becoming “an outlier in the democratic world”</a> by embracing a technology with no explicit legal basis, widespread inaccuracy, and discriminatory impacts. Critics noted that the <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/uk/home-news/riots-far-right-facial-recognition-tech-b2595048.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">government’s response to racist violence</a> focused not on addressing its causes, but on expanding state power over already over-policed communities.</p>



<p>The focus of policing is also shifting. As street crime continues to fall, more attention is directed toward protest, dissent, and the perceived risk of unrest. UK military operations abroad—most recently <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2025/03/28/suspected-us-airstrikes-hit-houthi-controlled-areas-of-yemen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joint airstrikes in Yemen</a>—raise the likelihood of retaliatory attacks. Surveillance systems originally developed for counter-terrorism are now being used to monitor social movements and suppress political disruption.</p>



<p>Recent protest laws support this shift. The Public Order Act and related legislation criminalise slow marches, locking-on, and disruption to infrastructure. These laws were drafted in response to climate protests from groups such as Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion. Often operating without strong ties to other struggles—like labour, housing or anti-racist organising—these campaigns were easier to isolate and criminalise. The <a href="https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN05013/SN05013.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resulting legal framework</a> now stands ready for broader use.</p>



<p>The surveillance and predictive systems now being assembled are being designed not only for the current moment, but in preparation for what comes next. Whether in response to renewed austerity, military escalation, or widespread resistance, these tools are positioned to contain unrest before it surfaces. What’s emerging is a model of preemptive policing—structured around behaviour, association, and predicted risk. Individuals are reduced to data profiles, tracked not for what they’ve done but for their statistical proximity to disruption. Suppression is exercised in advance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Risk scoring, biometric surveillance, and protest restrictions are being embedded into law and infrastructure. These powers are built to be extended—to trade unionists, migrant organisers, housing activists, and anyone seen to disrupt the smooth functioning of a society of control.</p>

<p>The future of intelligence is being set right now, and the path we’re on leads somewhere I don’t want to go. We’re drifting toward a world where intelligence is something you rent — where your ability to reason, create, and decide flows through systems you don’t control, can’t inspect, and didn’t shape. In that world, the landlord can change the terms anytime, and you have no recourse but to accept what you’re given.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think we can do better. Making that happen is now central to what Mozilla is doing.</p>



<h2>What we did for the web</h2>



<p>Twenty-five years ago, Microsoft Internet Explorer controlled 95% of the browser market, which meant Microsoft controlled how most people experienced the internet and who could build what on what terms. Mozilla was born to change this, and Firefox succeeded beyond what most people thought possible — dropping Internet Explorer’s market share to 55% in just a few years and ushering in the Web 2.0 era. The result was a fundamentally different internet. It was faster and richer for everyday users, and for developers it was a launchpad for open standards and open source that decentralized control over the core technologies of the web.</p>



<p>There’s a reason the browser is called a “user agent.” It was designed to be on your side — blocking ads, protecting your privacy, giving you choices that the sites you visited never would have offered on their own. That was the first fight, and we held the line for the open web even as social networks and mobile platforms became walled gardens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now AI is becoming the new intermediary. It’s what I’ve started calling “Layer 8” — the agentic layer that mediates between you and everything else on the internet. These systems will negotiate on our behalf, filter our information, shape our recommendations, and increasingly determine how we interact with the entire digital world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The question we have to ask is straightforward: Whose side will your new user agent be on?</p>



<h2>Why closed systems are winning (for now)</h2>



<p>We need to be honest about the current state of play: Closed AI systems are winning today because they are genuinely easier to use. If you’re a developer with an idea you want to test, you can have a working prototype in minutes using a single API call to one of the major providers. GPUs, models, hosting, guardrails, monitoring, billing — it all comes bundled together in a package that just works. I understand the appeal firsthand, because I’ve made the same choice myself on late-night side projects when I just wanted the fastest path from an idea in my head to something I could actually play with.</p>



<p>The open-source AI ecosystem is a different story. It’s powerful and advancing rapidly, but it’s also deeply fragmented — models live in one repository, tooling in another, and the pieces you need for evaluation, orchestration, guardrails, memory, and data pipelines are scattered across dozens of independent projects with different assumptions and interfaces. Each component is improving at remarkable speed, but they rarely integrate smoothly out of the box, and assembling a production-ready stack requires expertise and time that most teams simply don’t have to spare. This is the core challenge we face, and it’s important to name it clearly: What we’re dealing with isn’t a values problem where developers are choosing convenience over principle. It’s a developer experience problem. And developer experience problems can be solved.</p>



<h2><strong>The ground is already shifting</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve watched this dynamic play out before and the history is instructive. In the early days of the personal computer, open systems were rough, inconsistent, and difficult to use, while closed platforms offered polish and simplicity that made them look inevitable. Openness won anyway — not because users cared about principles, but because open systems unlocked experimentation and scale that closed alternatives couldn’t match. The same pattern repeated on the web, where closed portals like AOL and CompuServe dominated the early landscape before open standards outpaced them through sheer flexibility and the compounding benefits of broad participation.</p>



<p>AI has the potential to follow the same path — but only if someone builds it.&nbsp; And several shifts are already reshaping the landscape:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Small models have gotten remarkably good</strong>. 1 to 8 billion parameters, tuned for specific tasks — and they run on hardware that organizations already own;</li>



<li><strong>The economics are changing too</strong>. As enterprises feel the constraints of closed dependencies, self-hosting is starting to look like sound business rather than ideological commitment (companies like Pinterest have attributed millions of dollars in savings to migrating to open-source AI infrastructure);</li>



<li><strong>Governments want control over their supply chain</strong>. Governments are becoming increasingly unwilling to depend on foreign platforms for capabilities they consider strategically important, driving demand for sovereign systems; and,</li>



<li><strong>Consumer expectations keep rising</strong>. People want AI that responds instantly, understands their context, and works across their tools without locking them into a single platform.</li>
</ul>



<p>The capability gap that once justified the dominance of closed systems is closing fast. What remains is a gap in usability and integration. The lesson I take from history is that openness doesn’t win by being more principled than the alternatives. Openness wins when it becomes the better deal — cheaper, more capable, and just as easy to use</p>



<h2><strong>Where the cracks are forming</strong></h2>



<p>If openness is going to win, it won’t happen everywhere at once. It will happen at specific tipping points  — places where the defaults haven’t yet hardened, where a well-timed push can change what becomes normal. We see four.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="522" src="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2026/01/image-1024x522.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2026/01/image-1024x522.png 1024w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2026/01/image-300x153.png 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2026/01/image-768x391.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2026/01/image-1536x782.png 1536w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2026/01/image-1000x509.png 1000w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2026/01/image.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p><strong>The first is developer experience.</strong> Developers are the ones who actually build the future  — every default they set, every stack they choose, every dependency they adopt shapes what becomes normal for everyone else. Right now, the fastest path runs through closed APIs, and that’s where most of the building is happening. But developers don’t want to be locked in any more than users do. Give them open tools that work as well as the closed ones, and they’ll build the open ecosystem themselves.</p>



<p><strong>The second is data.</strong> For a decade, the assumption has been that data is free to scrape  — that the web is a commons to be harvested without asking. That norm is breaking, and not a moment too soon. The people and communities who create valuable data deserve a say in how it’s used and a share in the value it creates. We’re moving toward a world of licensed, provenance-based, permissioned data. The infrastructure for that transition is still being built, which means there’s still a chance to build it right.</p>



<p><strong>The third is models.</strong> The dominant architecture today favors only the biggest labs, because only they can afford to train massive dense transformers. But the edges are accelerating: small models, mixtures of experts, domain-specific models, multilingual models. As these approaches mature, the ability to create and customize intelligence spreads to communities, companies, and countries that were previously locked out.</p>



<p><strong>The fourth is compute.</strong> This remains the choke point. Access to specialized hardware still determines who can train and deploy at scale. More doors need to open  — through distributed compute, federated approaches, sovereign clouds, idle GPUs finding productive use.</p>



<h2><strong>What an open stack could look like</strong></h2>



<p>Today’s dominant AI platforms are building vertically integrated stacks: closed applications on top of closed models trained on closed data, running on closed compute. Each layer reinforces the next  — data improves models, models improve applications, applications generate more data that only the platform can use. It’s a powerful flywheel. If it continues unchallenged, we arrive at an AI era equivalent to AOL, except far more centralized. You don’t build on the platform; you build inside it.</p>



<p>There’s another path. The sum of Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP won because that combination became easier to use than the proprietary alternatives, and because they let developers build things that no commercial platform would have prioritized. The web we have today exists because that stack existed.</p>



<p>We think AI can follow the same pattern. Not one stack controlled by any single party, but many stacks shaped by the communities, countries, and companies that use them:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Open developer interfaces at the top</strong>. SDKs, guardrails, workflows, and orchestration that don’t lock you into a single vendor;</li>



<li><strong>Open data standards underneath</strong>. Provenance, consent, and portability built in by default, so you know where your training data came from and who has rights to it;</li>



<li><strong>An open model ecosystem below that</strong>. Smaller, specialized, interchangeable models that you can inspect, tune to your values, and run where you need them; and&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Open compute infrastructure at the foundation</strong>. Distributed and federated hardware across cloud and edge, not routed through a handful of hyperscn/lallers.</li>
</ul>



<p>Pieces of this stack already exist — good ones, built by talented people. The task now is to fill in the gaps, connect what’s there, and make the whole thing as easy to use as the closed alternatives. That’s the work.</p>



<h2><strong>Why open source matters here</strong></h2>



<p>If you’ve followed Mozilla, you know <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">the Manifesto</a>. For almost 20 years, it’s guided what we build and how  — not as an abstract ideal, but as a tool for making principled decisions every single day. Three of its principles are especially urgent in the age of AI:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Human agency</strong>. In a world of AI agents, it’s more important than ever that technology lets people shape their own experiences — and protects privacy where it matters most;</li>



<li><strong>Decentralization and open source</strong>. An open, accessible internet depends on innovation and broad participation in how technology gets created and used. The success of open-source AI, built around transparent community practices, is critical to making this possible; and</li>



<li><strong>Balancing commercial and public benefit</strong>. The direction of AI is being set by commercial players. We need strong public-benefit players to create balance in the overall ecosystem.</li>
</ul>



<p>Open-source AI is how these principles become real. It’s what makes plurality possible  — many intelligences shaped by many communities, not one model to rule them all. It’s what makes sovereignty possible  — owning your infrastructure rather than renting it. And it’s what keeps the door open for public-benefit alternatives to exist alongside commercial ones.</p>



<h2><strong>What we’ll do in 2026</strong></h2>



<p>The window to shape these defaults is still open, but it won’t stay open forever. Here’s where we’re putting our effort  — not because we have all the answers, but because we think these are the places where openness can still reset the defaults before they harden.</p>



<p><strong>Make open AI easier than closed. </strong><a href="http://mozilla.ai/">Mozilla.ai </a>is building <a href="https://www.mozilla.ai/open-tools/choice-first-stack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">any-s</a><a href="http://mozilla.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uite,</a> a modular framework that integrates the scattered components of the open AI stack — model routing, evaluation, guardrails, memory, orchestration  — into something coherent that developers can actually adopt without becoming infrastructure specialists. The goal is concrete: Getting started with open AI should feel as simple as making a single API call.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Shift the economics of data.</strong> The <a href="https://datacollective.mozillafoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mozilla Data Collective</a> is building a marketplace for data that is properly licensed, clearly sourced, and aligned with the values of the communities it comes from. It gives developers access to high-quality training data while ensuring that the people and institutions who contribute that data have real agency and share in the economic value it creates.</p>



<p><strong>Learn from real deployments.</strong> Strategy that isn’t grounded in practical experience is just speculation, so we’re deepening our engagement with governments and enterprises adopting sovereign, auditable AI systems. These engagements are the feedback loops that tell us where the stack breaks and where openness needs reinforcement.</p>



<p><strong>Invest in the ecosystem. </strong>We’re not just building; we’re backing others who are building too. Mozilla Ventures is investing in open-source AI companies that align with these principles. Mozilla Foundation is funding researchers and projects through targeted grants. We can’t do everything ourselves, and we shouldn’t try. The goal is to put resources behind the people and teams already doing the work.</p>



<p><strong>Show up for the community.</strong> The open-source AI ecosystem is vast, and it’s hard to know what’s working, what’s hype, and where the real momentum is building. We want to be useful here. We’re launching a newsletter to track what’s actually happening in open AI. We’re running meetups and hackathons to bring builders together. We’re fielding developer surveys to understand what people actually need. And at <a href="https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MozFest</a> this year, we’re adding a dedicated developer track focused on open-source AI. If you’re doing important work in this space, we want to help it find the people who need to see it.</p>



<h2><strong>Are you in?</strong></h2>



<p>Mozilla is one piece of a much larger movement, and we have no interest in trying to own or control it — we just want to help it succeed. There’s a growing community of people who believe the open internet is still worth defending and who are working to ensure that AI develops along a different path than the one the largest platforms have laid out. Not everyone in that community uses the same language or builds exactly the same things, but something like a shared purpose is emerging. Mozilla sees itself as part of that effort.</p>



<p>We kept the web open not by asking anyone’s permission, but by building something that worked better than the alternatives. We’re ready to do that again.</p>



<p>So: Are you in?</p>



<p>If you’re a developer building toward an open source AI future, we want to work with you. If you’re a researcher, investor, policymaker, or founder aligned with these goals, let’s talk. If you’re at a company that wants to build with us rather than against us, the door is open. Open alternatives have to exist — that keeps everyone honest.</p>



<p>The future of intelligence is being set now. The question is whether you’ll own it, or rent it.</p>

  Meanwhile, ‘Fiona’ said that “protesters have seized Balmoral Estate” and “International markets are dumping UK assets as images of tanks in <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/local-news/edinburgh-news/?ref=au" target="_blank">Edinburgh</a> go viral”.
</p>

<p>
  ‘Lucy’ claimed that "farmers have used tractors to block the A1 at the English border”, while another account called ‘<a href="https://x.com/kelly18600" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kelly</a>’ said that “army trucks are rolling down the Royal Mile. Soldiers in fatigues are guarding the Scottish Parliament”.
</p>
<p>
  Previously, a group of pseudonymous accounts expressing support for Scottish independence went dark immediately after the internet in Iran collapsed amid Israeli and US strikes in June 2025.
</p>
<p>
  At the time, <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25413339.iranian-bots-behind-1-300-pro-independence-x-accounts/" target="_blank">disinformation analysis firm Cyabra claimed</a> that as much as “26% of profiles discussing Scottish independence were fake”.

  Similarly, a 2024 <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/centers-institutes/watt/hub/images/hiding-under-the-kilt1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a> by researchers at Clemson University has estimated that 4% of content relating to independence were linked to one Iranian-backed bot network of around 80 accounts.&nbsp;

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We need to talk about war. And we need to talk about companies building bots that propose to rewrite our source code. And about the people behind both, and how we preserve what is great about FOSS while avoiding disruption. How do geopolitical conflicts on the one hand and the risk of bot-generated (adversarial) code on the other influence the global community working together on Free and Open Source software?</p>
<hr>
<p>The immense corpus of free and open source software created by a global community of researchers and engineers, developers, architects and designers is an impressive achievement of human collaboration at an unprecedented scale. An even bigger circle of users, translators, writers, creatives, civil society advocates, public servants and private sector stakeholders has helped to further develop and spread this technological Gesamtkunstwerk far and wide - with the help of the internet and the web. With individual freedoms and user empowerment at its center, these jointly created digital public goods have removed many economic and societal barriers for a large part of the world's population. Users are not just allowed to benefit from technology, but each and every user can in principle actively help shape it. On top of the FOSS ecosystem our global economy has been propelled to unprecedented levels.</p>
<p>Much of this incredible growth was achieved within a (relatively) calm geopolitical situation, in the wake of the cold war which ended in the very same year that also saw the genesis of the World Wide Web at CERN in Switzerland. Economists, philosophers and other observers at the time spoke of the 'end of history' and expected no more big conflicts at the superpower level. We could now globalise the economy and all work together. The flood of innovation taking place all around us promised a bright future for all, with room for altruism and collaboration. In retrospect it certainly was an ideal situation for an optimistic and constructive global movement like the FOSS community to take over the helm.</p>
<p>But apart from the fact that under the surface that narrative was already flawed (with some actors like the USA having a double agenda, as the Snowden and Shadowbrokers revelations exposed) history didn't end. To some ironic extent we are now becoming victim of our own success. In recent years we've seen geopolitical stability punctured by war effort levering low cost technology that includes heaps of FOSS. Social media powered by FOSS infrastructure promote disinformation and have successfully stirred large scale polarisation. Within some of the largest and most populous countries on the planet authoritarian regimes have successfully used technology to break oppression in a new race towards totalitarianism. While for instance Europe has tried to regulate 'dual use' technology, "any use" technology (which our libre licenses guarantee) has escaped our attention. Even in countries which had stable non-authoritarian regimes there is a visible technology-assisted relapse towards anti-democratic movements. On the back of a tech stack which consists of FOSS with a thin crust of proprietary special sauce, unprecedented private capital (sometimes referred to as 'hypercapitalism') is interfering with global politics at an alarming rate. Apart from the direct democratic disbalance the resulting oligarchy is giving rise to overt nepotism, corruption and a new global protectorate for predatory business models and unethical extractive behaviour. Expecting peace in cyberspace any time soon is probably naive, and free and open source technology stands to make up for a significant part of the battleground.</p>
<p>At the same time we are facing other challenges, such as climate change and an imminent scarcity of non-renewable resources. We have more people living on the surface of the planet than ever before, and they are consuming more raw materials and more energy than ever. This won't go on indefinitely. And right at that point we see an army of next generation Trojan horses galloping through the gates of our global commons villages, accelerating our use of both. Generative pre-trained transformers (also known as Large Language Models) kindly offer to take cumbersome and boring coding work off our hands. They can liberate us from responsibility and allow us to do other things or move even faster.</p>
<p>But is it really wise to accept this apparent gift, or should we be a little more suspicious? Just as it has proven way too easy for AI to poison the web with fake content, our software supply chain is vulnerable to manipulation. The attack surface is immense. Due to the inherent complexity of software it is easier to achieve and harder to detect manipulation before it is too late. While many talented and committed people have spent years reverse engineering binary blobs to avoid the associated risks, those blobs were at least isolated and clearly marked. AI is the ultimate black box and it introduces significantly more uncertainty: it rewrites the truth from the inside.</p>
<p>AI in its current form has no actual sense of truth or ethics. Like with Russian roulette, once in a while the models completely bork up and create phantom code and real risk - and that is even in a best case scenario, without assuming malicious intent and manipulation from the outside. In an adversarial scenario (and this adversity can come from traditional nation state actors with non-aligned interests but also from corporate or even private individuals with some determination - like Cambridge Analytica illustrated so vividly) manipulation only requires subtle changes. At the frantic scale at which any available learning content is ingested from the internet these days one can expect targeted adversarial training to manipulate specific code with subtle triggers to go unnoticed.</p>
<p>As a community we have spent billions of hours of careful coding and software engineering to make free and open source technology as trustworthy as it is today. Geopolitical conflict is an incentive to hollow out that trust. AI is an additional leap of faith, and if you look at the forces driving its adoption and their interests, are we really sure those black boxes are safe to invite into our trusted coding base? It is clear that the end game of AI coding is not a healthy FOSS ecosystem, but its total displacement. The threat of machine crafted and man-crafted malicious code in war-time FOSS are equally realistic. Perhaps we can find a middle ground, where we combine some of AI and human skill - and add enough checks and balances, and a variety of assurances through compartementalisation, formal and symbolical proofs and other traditional means of quality assurance.</p>
<p>This talk is an open exploration of some of the challenges the FOSS community will have in the years ahead, working towards a hopeful notion of maximal defendable FOSS.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:16:10 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://cssence.com/2026/text-based-web-browsers/">https://cssence.com/2026/text-based-web-browsers/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46597518">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Before I start, let me get two things out of the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>In this article I’m <strong>not</strong> going to include the admittedly cool <a href="https://www.brow.sh/">browsh,</a> because it only works by utilizing Firefox under the hood. When I say text-based, I’m talking about old-school browsers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELinks">ELinks</a>, <a href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net/">Lynx</a> or <a href="https://w3m.sourceforge.net/">w3m.</a> These are also the three browsers I’ve used to test everything described below.</li>
<li>The whole article ended up being a rant about how text-based browsers deal with features that got added to HTML. Or more like, how they neglect dealing with said features.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="do-text-based-web-browsers-still-matter" tabindex="-1">Do text-based web browsers still matter?</h2>
<p>Well, I won’t be the judge of that. I like them, I have them installed, and I test every project I create in them. But they are not what I use to surf the web.</p>
<p>Speaking of testing your creations, here’s the good news: If your project has a solid HTML foundation that you then <a href="https://cssence.com/2021/the-day-the-website-stood-still/">progressively enhance</a> with CSS and JS, you are off to a great start.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-html-evolve-in-recent-years" tabindex="-1">How did HTML evolve in recent years?</h2>
<p>While CSS is the star of the show when it comes to new features, HTML ain’t stale either. If we put the long-awaited <strong>styleable selects</strong> and Apple’s take on <strong>toggle switches</strong> aside, there’s a lot readily available cross-browser.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: Whenever we say cross-browser, we usually look at the big ones, never at text-based browsers. So in this article I wanna shed some light on how they handle the following recent additions.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-text-based-web-browsers-handle-modern-html" tabindex="-1">How do text-based web browsers handle modern HTML?</h2>
<nav aria-labelledby="toc">

<ul>
<li><a href="#details">Details</a></li>
<li><a href="#data-lists">Data lists</a></li>
<li><a href="#dialogs">Dialogs</a></li>
<li><a href="#popovers">Popovers</a></li>
<li><a href="#inert-content-areas">Inert content areas</a></li>
<li><a href="#hidden-content">Hidden content</a></li>
<li><a href="#visually-hidden-content">Visually hidden content</a></li>
</ul>
</nav>
<p>When viewing a web page in a text-based browser, you essentially get plain HTML, no CSS, no JS. There is some “styling”, a result of the elements’ semantics, but don’t expect anything fancy, we are down to colors, indentation, and centered text.</p>
<p>It reminds me of what the browsers we are used to give us when they show unstyled HTML—well, HTML with the browser default styles, to be exact. That in turn reminds me of <a href="https://cssence.com/about/css-naked-day/">CSS Naked Day.</a></p>
<p>Text-based browsers work well with good old HTML. Said recent additions however are a bit more nuanced (e.g. interactive), so let’s talk about them individually.</p>
<h3 id="details" tabindex="-1">Details</h3>
<p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/using-styling-the-details-element/">Disclosure widgets</a> are simple interactive elements we no longer need JS for. When <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> are closed, only their <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> is shown.</p>
<p>Text-based browsers have no clue what disclosure widgets are, so they always show the whole <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> content, meaning you always get the <code>open</code> state. This way things can get verbose, but in essence it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Acceptable.</p>
<h3 id="data-lists" tabindex="-1">Data lists</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/datalist">Data lists</a> can be used to add suggested values to an input field. In my tests they have been ignored entirely, Lynx even mentions that it encountered “bad HTML”, probably because it expects <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> only in a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> parent. At least no browser rendered the options on the screen, they simply fall back to a plain <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> field, which is better than nothing. Side note: I’ve been told data lists have accessibility issues, so …</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Whatever.</p>
<h3 id="dialogs" tabindex="-1">Dialogs</h3>
<p>Yes, HTML can do <a href="https://web.dev/learn/html/dialog/">modal and non-modal dialogs, and even alert dialogs,</a> all thanks to the <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> element. Initially we needed JS to toggle their visibility, but with the help of the Popover API (see next chapter) we can now even get most of it done in plain HTML.</p>
<p>Alas, once again there is no support in text-based browsers, so you’ll end up seeing all dialog content, as if they had their <code>open</code> attribute set. Consequently, there’s no awareness of a form’s <code>method="dialog"</code> nor a submit button’s <code>formmethod="dialog"</code>, so in both cases the form <code>action</code> is triggered.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Problematic.</p>
<h3 id="popovers" tabindex="-1">Popovers</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/introducing-popover-api/">The Popover API</a> is probably my favorite new feature, but only if you stick to regular web browsers.</p>
<p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/clarifying-the-relationship-between-popovers-and-dialogs/">Given that dialogs are a type of popover,</a> it’s no surprise that nothing works, and once again all <code>popover</code> content gets dumped onto the screen.</p>
<p>By now I think you get the idea, so I won’t even talk about the <a href="https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2025/7/">Invoker Commands API</a> at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Most likely problematic.</p>
<h3 id="inert-content-areas" tabindex="-1">Inert content areas</h3>
<p><a href="https://web.dev/articles/inert">A modal dialog makes the rest of the page inert</a>, so we don’t have to do it. But with the global <code>inert</code> attribute we can do this manually too, if we need to make certain parts of the DOM unreachable.</p>
<p>Sure enough, text-based browsers will happily let you access interactive elements inside an inert content area.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Bad.</p>
<h3 id="hidden-content" tabindex="-1">Hidden content</h3>
<p>We’re now approaching something that is not new at all, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/hidden">global hidden attribute</a> has been supported for over a decade. It allows us to hide content in the same way as <code>display: none</code>, but directly in HTML.</p>
<p>Adding support in text-based browsers has been discussed back in the day, but got rejected, hence it was never implemented. You’ll end up seeing all content marked as <code>hidden</code>. This is the primary reason why I started writing this article, and what enrages me the most. If I decide to hide content in HTML instead of CSS, I must have a very good reason, thus hidden content should not be visible in any browser! Certain progressive enhancement techniques work by hiding content in HTML and then making it visible via CSS or JS. That possibility goes out the window in text-based browsers.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Epic fail. 😠 🤬</p>
<h3 id="visually-hidden-content" tabindex="-1">Visually hidden content</h3>
<p>Just kidding, there’s still <a href="https://cssence.com/2024/native-visually-hidden/">no native way in HTML to hide content visually</a>, so we continue to rely on class names like <code>.visually-hidden</code> or <code>.sr-only</code>. No matter how they are named, they need to summon <a href="https://vispero.com/resources/the-anatomy-of-visually-hidden/">quite a few of lines of CSS</a> to get things done. Whether there should be a native way is up for debate. Personally I would welcome a one-liner to achieve this, but it should remain in the domain of CSS.</p>
<p>However, if we had a way in HTML, text-based browsers would display such visually hidden content anyway, that is certain.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> To be continued.</p>
<h2 id="now-what-what-now" tabindex="-1">Now what? What now?</h2>
<p>Text-based browsers and modern HTML, no success story in sight. Given the progress we see in web technologies, the gap will only widen, so much so that w3m and its friends might fall into oblivion.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<h2>Why AI Overviews produces errors</h2>
<p>The recurring problems with AI Overviews stem from a design flaw in how the system works. As we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-is-flawed-by-design-and-a-new-company-blog-post-hints-at-why/">reported</a> in May 2024, Google built AI Overviews to show information backed up by top web results from its page ranking system. The company designed the feature this way based on the assumption that highly ranked pages contain accurate information.</p>
<p>However, Google’s page ranking algorithm has long struggled with SEO-gamed content and spam. The system now feeds these unreliable results to its AI model, which then summarizes them with an authoritative tone that can mislead users. Even when the AI draws from accurate sources, the language model can still <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/">draw incorrect conclusions</a> from the data, producing flawed summaries of otherwise reliable information.</p>
<p>The technology does not inherently provide factual accuracy. Instead, it reflects whatever inaccuracies exist on the websites Google’s algorithm ranks highly, presenting the facts with an authority that makes errors appear trustworthy.</p>
<h2>Other examples remain active</h2>
<p>The Guardian found that typing slight variations of the original queries into Google, such as “lft reference range” or “lft test reference range,” still prompted AI Overviews. Hebditch said this was a big worry and that the AI Overviews present a list of tests in bold, making it very easy for readers to miss that these numbers might not even be the right ones for their test.</p>
<p>AI Overviews still appear for other examples that The Guardian originally highlighted to Google. When asked why these AI Overviews had not also been removed, Google said they linked to well-known&nbsp;and reputable sources and informed people when it was important to seek out expert advice.</p>
<p>Google said AI Overviews only appear for queries where it has high confidence in the quality of the responses. The company constantly measures and reviews the quality of its summaries across many different categories of information, it added.</p>
<p>This is not the first controversy for AI Overviews. The feature has previously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/">told</a> people to put glue on pizza and eat rocks. It has proven unpopular enough that users have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/01/just-give-me-the-fing-links-cursing-disables-googles-ai-overviews/">discovered</a> that inserting curse words into search queries disables AI Overviews entirely.</p>

compress (and hopefully decompress) text files using a Large Language
Model. The compression ratio is much higher than with other
compression tools. There are some caveats of course:
<ul>
  <li>A GPU is necessary to get a reasonable speed. 4 GB of RAM is
    required. </li>
  <li>It is slower than conventional compressors (compression and
    decompression speed: up to 1 MB/s on a RTX 4090).</li>
  <li>Only text files are supported. Binary files won't be compressed
  much. The currently used language model (RWKV 169M v4) was trained
  mostly on English texts. Other languages are supported including
  source code.</li>
  <li>It is experimental so no backward compability should be expected
    between the various versions.</li>
  <li>See also <a href="https://www.bellard.org/ts_sms">ts_sms</a> which is optimized for the
    compression of small messages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compression Ratio</h2>
<p>
The compression ratio is given in bits per byte (bpb).

<h2>Technical information</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>ts_zip</code> uses
  the <a href="https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM">RWKV 169M v4</a>
  language model which is a good compromise between speed and
  compression ratio. The model is quantized to 8 bits per parameter
    and evaluated using BF16 floating point numbers.</li>
  <li>The language model predicts the probabilities of the next token. An
    arithmetic coder then encodes the next token according to the
    probabilities.</li>
  <li>The model is evaluated in a deterministic and reproducible
    way. Hence the result does not depend on the exact GPU or CPU
    model nor on the number of configured threads. This key point
    ensures that a compressed file can be decompressed using a
    different hardware or software configuration.</li>
