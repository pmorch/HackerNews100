Fifteen people died as a result, including three crew and 12 on the ground.</p><p>In an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Documents/DCA26MA024%20Investigative%20Update.pdf">update report</a>, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) revealed that cracks found in the engine mounting assembly had previously occurred on several other aircraft.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>At the time the manufacturer responsible for the aircraft, Boeing, concluded that the issue "would not result in a safety of flight condition".</p><p>The MD-11 is a relatively elderly design that was originally produced by McDonnell Douglas.  Boeing acquired the company in 1997.</p><p>The last MD-11 came off the production line in 2001, but Boeing has continued providing parts and service support.</p><p>In the aftermath of the Kentucky disaster, the NTSB issued a preliminary report which drew attention to cracks in the engine attachment mechanism. Its latest update goes further, describing fractures due to evidence of "fatigue" – or repeated stresses - in a critical bearing, as well as the mounting it is meant to sit in.</p><p>It points out that Boeing had previously found failures of the same part on four occasions, affecting three different aircraft. In 2011, the company sent a "service letter" to operators warning them of its findings. This is a non legally-binding document used to alert operators about important safety or maintenance information.</p><p>In this case, Boeing recommended that the part be included in a general visual inspection every five years. It also pointed out changes to the inspection procedure contained in the aircraft maintenance manual, and drew attention to a revised bearing assembly that could be fitted – although this was not mandatory.</p><p>Tim Atkinson, a former air accident investigator who now works as an aviation safety consultant, said the NTSB's update made disturbing reading.</p><p>"The structure concerned is not decorative, it's an essential part of the mechanism that attaches the engine to the wing, and carries loads such as thrust and drag," he explained.</p><p>"It's extraordinary that Boeing concluded that a failure of this part would not have safety consequences," he claimed.</p><p>Boeing's internal processes have come under fire on a number of occasions in recent years.</p><p>Criticisms have focused on how the design of its 737 Max included flawed software that was implicated in two accidents, in 2018 and 2019, that together cost 346 lives.</p><p>Quality controls in its factories have also come under scrutiny, after a door panel fell off a brand new 737 Max shortly after take-off in early 2024.</p><p>In a statement, Boeing said: "We continue to support the investigation led by the NTSB. Our deepest condolences go out to the families who lost loved ones and our thoughts remain with all those affected."</p><p>The NTSB's investigation is continuing. It has not yet issued any firm conclusions about the cause of the accident, and is unlikely to do so until it publishes its final report.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Log message:
vio: Support MTU feature

Add support for the VIRTIO_NET_F_MTU which allows to get the hardmtu
from the hypervisor. Also set the current mtu to the same value. The
virtio standard is not clear if that is recommended, but Linux does
this, too.

Use ETHER_MAX_HARDMTU_LEN as upper hardmtu limit instead of MAXMCLBYTES,
as this seems to be more correct.

If the hypervisor requests a MTU larger than ETHER_MAX_HARDMTU_LEN,
redo feature negotiation without VIRTIO_NET_F_MTU.

With this commit, OpenBSD finally works on Apple Virtualization.

<p dir="auto">For the good of the project, we're going to begin <strong>automatically closing pull requests from external contributors</strong>. We will of course continue to welcome issues, bug reports, and discussions. This is a temporary policy until GitHub provides better tools for managing contributions.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Getting ahead of it</h3>
<p dir="auto">Like many other open-source projects on GitHub, we’ve recently seen a significant increase in contributions generated entirely by AI tools. While some of these pull requests are formally correct, most suffer from incomplete or misleading context, misunderstanding of the codebase, and little to no follow-up engagement from their authors.</p>
<p dir="auto">An open pull request represents a commitment from maintainers: that the contribution will be reviewed carefully and considered seriously for inclusion. For that commitment to remain meaningful, we need to be more selective. For now, that means closing first and selectively re-opening pull requests that are actually under consideration, with the expectation that most unsolicited submissions will not be reviewed.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Weird year coming</h3>
<p dir="auto">I first made the tldraw repository public in 2021, and I’ve been proud to invite public contribution to its code and have been happy to have many improving pull requests over the years. I’m sorry to shut that down, however I sincerely believe this decision is in the best interests of the project, our code, and our community. With luck, GitHub will soon roll out management features that let us open things back up.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is going to be a weird year for programmers and open source especially. For now, whether you’ve contributed before, are interested in contributing in the future, or just are a friend of the project: thank you and please hang on while we all figure this stuff out.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>When I was a junior engineer, my manager would occasionally confide his frustrations to me in our weekly 1:1s. He would point out a project another team was working on and say, “I don’t believe that project will go anywhere, they’re solving the wrong problem.” I used to wonder, “But you are very senior, why don’t you just go and speak to them about your concerns?” It felt like a waste of his influence to not say anything.</p><p>So it’s quite ironic that I found myself last week explaining to a mentee why I thought a sister team’s project would have to pivot because they’d made a poor early design choice. And he rightfully asked me the same question I had years ago: “why don’t you just tell them your opinion?” It’s been on my mind ever since because I realized I’d changed my stance on it a lot over the years.</p><p><strong>The answer is that being right and being effective are different.</strong></p><p>In large companies, speaking up about what you see as a “bad project” is a good thing. But only in moderation. Sometimes the mark of seniority is realizing that arguing with people who won’t listen isn’t worth it; it’s better to save your counsel.</p><h2 id="bad-projects">Bad projects</h2><p>What I mean by a “bad project” is many things:</p><ul><li><strong>UX</strong>: making product complicated, solving a problem which doesn’t exist, breaking existing workflows</li><li><strong>Technical</strong>: overcomplicated design, wrong library, poor performing architecture</li><li><strong>Political</strong>: chasing hype cycles, exists primarily to justify a promotion</li></ul><p>It’s important to point out that for much of the lifecycle of a project, whether it’s “bad” is <em>highly</em> subjective. Software engineering is largely a game of tradeoffs and making decisions which are not perfect but the best possible with the information available. There often can be disagreements on whether correct choices are made and it only becomes obvious much later on, potentially years after a project has shipped.</p><p>But as you become more senior, you’ll start to have “taste” when it comes to software projects and that will cause you to look at some fraction of the software projects and feel “this doesn’t make sense”. And this gut feeling is the sign to me of a “bad project”, one which you can see in advance of when it’s obvious to everyone.</p><p>Drawing on my personal experience, the most memorable example was a few years ago at Google . There was a high-profile announcement internally of a “game changer” project that sat right at the intersection of two extremely large organizations. It was technically amazing and elegant, and full of clever ideas for really hard problems.</p><p>But I distinctly remember sitting in the room for the announcement, turning to my lead and whispering, “This project has no chance of succeeding, right?” He turned to me and just said, “Yup.” We both realized the problem immediately. The project was entirely based on a platform team asking a flagship product team to give up control of their core user flow: technically the right move, but no lead or PM would ever cede ownership of something that central to another team. Politically, this project was a total fantasy.</p><p>The project kept quietly chugging away in the background for almost two years. Every time it got close to launch, it would get pushed back as “not ready yet.” Over time, we heard less and less about it until, eventually, the inevitable “strategic pivot” email appeared in my inbox. Resources were reallocated and the code was deleted. We were told the company “learned a lot from the effort,” but to me it felt like it was doomed from the beginning. Politics and solving the correct problem matter just as much as technical beauty.</p><h2 id="why-you-cannot-stop-them-all">Why you cannot stop them all</h2><p>When I started noticing “bad projects” and I felt that I had some expertise to share, the temptation for me was to start calling them out. Reach out to the team doing it, tell them “this doesn’t make sense” and explain to them why. Use facts and logic to persuade.</p><p>And I did do this. But only for a very short time before I realized that there are a lot of costs to doing this that I just wasn’t thinking about.</p><p>Firstly, software companies have an inherent bias for action. They value speed and shipping highly. Concerns, by definition, <em>slow things down</em> and mean people have to look at things which they hadn’t budgeted for. And so unless your concern is big enough to overcome the “push for landing”, there’s little chance for any meaningful change to come from you saying something. In fact, it’s very likely that you’ll be largely ignored.</p><p>Related to this, even if the team <em>does</em> take your concern seriously, you have to be careful not to do it too often. Once or twice, you might be seen as someone who is upholding “quality”. But do it too often and you quickly move to being seen as a “negative person”, someone who is constantly a problem maker, not a problem “fixer”. You rarely get credit for the disasters you prevented. Because nothing happened, people forget about it quickly.</p><p>There’s also the problem that every time you push back, you are potentially harming someone’s promotion packet or a VP’s “pet project.” You are at risk of burning bridges and creating “enemies”, at least of a sort. Having a few people who disagree in a big company with you is the cost of doing business, but if you have too many, it starts affecting your main work too.</p><p>Finally, there is also the psychological impact. There is one of you and hundreds of engineers working in spaces that your expertise might help with. Your attention is finite, but the capacity for a large company to generate bad ideas is infinite. Speaking from experience, getting too involved in stopping these quickly can make you <em>very</em> cynical about the state of the world. And this is really not a good place to be.</p><h2 id="manage-influence-like-a-bank-account">Manage influence like a bank account</h2><p>So if you cannot stop all the bad projects, what do you do? You get strategic. Instead of trying to fix everything, view your influence as a bank account. You have a certain amount of “influence” coming in every month as you do your job, help people, ship successful projects, and generally remain low friction.</p><p>Then, when it matters, you should be ready to make “withdrawals.” Every time you block something or raise concerns, no matter how small, you are writing a check against your balance. But not all checks are the same size:</p><ul><li><strong>The $5 Check:</strong> A nitpick on a code review. Cheap, daily expense.</li><li><strong>The $500 Check:</strong> Challenging an architectural decision or pushing back on a timeline. Requires some savings.</li><li><strong>The $50,000 Check:</strong> Trying to kill a VP’s pet project. This is a massive spend. You might only afford this once every few years.</li></ul><p>The problem comes if you spend $5 on every minor inefficiency you see. If you are constantly saying “no” to small things, your account will be empty when you need to write the big check to stop a true disaster.</p><p>If you “go overdrawn,” you enter political bankruptcy. People stop inviting you to meetings, they stop asking for your opinion, they essentially start working around you. Once you are bankrupt, your influence drops to zero and you not only harm your ability to influence things but also start hurting your own ability to get things done.</p><h2 id="when-to-spend-influence">When to spend influence</h2><p>Given that we’ve now accepted that we cannot weigh in on everything, we need to figure out when it <em>does</em> make sense to do so.</p><p>The most important thing to do first is to be humble and evaluate whether you actually have the expertise to make a judgment. Seniority often brings opinions, but those are not always informed opinions. For example, while I have some frontend experience, I do not feel qualified to give deep advice on it because my knowledge is “enough to get by” rather than deep expertise that comes from long term ownership. It is easy to lose sight of the fact that high-quality judgments require informed opinions. If you find yourself in this position, see yourself as an opinionated observer and stop there.</p><p>You must also internalize the fact that just because you say something does not make it the truth. You are raising awareness of a point of view, not issuing a decree. So if some team doesn’t listen to your concerns and decides to go ahead with what they were doing anyway, then you have to accept that and move on: at the end of the day, you’re an engineer, not a CEO with authority over them!</p><p>Given these points, I use three main factors to decide when to speak up:</p><ol><li><strong>How close is the project to my team?</strong></li><li><strong>If it goes wrong, how much impact will it have on my team?</strong></li><li><strong>If it goes wrong, how big will the problem be for the company?</strong></li></ol><p><strong>Proximity.</strong> If a project is close to you, the “price tag” of saying something is lower. If it is within your own team, the cost is near zero because you have high trust and a quick conversation often solves it. If it is in your broader organization, the price goes up; you have to spend social capital and potentially stake your reputation. If it is outside your org? The cost is often prohibitive. You have zero leverage, different reporting chains, and stopping it would require a massive withdrawal.</p><p><strong>Team Impact.</strong> Sometimes another org does something that deeply affects your work. For example, because <a href="https://perfetto.dev/">Perfetto</a> (the performance tool I work on) has users throughout Google, sometimes a team will ask us to sign off on a very complex integration. This is a classic risk: if things go right, they get the credit, but if things go wrong, your leadership might expect <em>you</em> to help solve a problem you didn’t create. In these cases, the payoff of speaking up is high because you are protecting your team.</p><p><strong>Company Scale.</strong> Finally, consider the blast radius. Some projects are self-contained; if they fail, they only take themselves down. Others are so intertwined with core systems that their failure causes widespread damage or creates technical debt that persists for years. These can be deadly to the long-term health of a project.</p><h2 id="how-to-act-with-bad-projects">How to act with bad projects</h2><p>It’s also not just about when you put your opinions forward but how you do it. There’s a very wide range of actions you can take depending on what you’re facing.</p><h3 id="when-you-intervene">When you intervene</h3><p>The nuclear option is to directly say “we should not do this” and try to shut the project down. This almost always requires escalation to your leads and the leads of the owning team, requiring great conviction in both the fact that you’re right and that this project will be actively harmful. But on some occasions, this is the right thing to do, especially if the cost of not saying something can be existential to your project or team.</p><p>A slightly softer but still quite risky variant of this is, instead of doing a direct escalation, you raise concerns in directly with the team. Usually this is done with a meeting with the team or a strongly worded “concern” or “rebuttal” doc. The goal is to speak in strong enough terms that the team themselves conclude that this the project might not be a good idea.</p><p>Then there are the smaller interventions, nudging things in the right direction. These are perfect for when a team is about to do something that makes sense from a high level but they are going about this the wrong way. I see this often with Perfetto: a team sends a design doc proposing a complex use of Perfetto that I know will cause them pain later. I sit down with them, understand their actual problem, and guide them to a better solution. It costs an hour but saves them months. If you do it right, you can even be seen as a helper rather than a hindrance, even if you do slow down the team.</p><h3 id="when-you-dont">When you don’t</h3><p>Sometimes you conclude that the ROI just isn’t there to do anything direct: the political momentum is too strong, or the issue is too small to justify spending any influence. At this point, what you do depends on how much your team is involved.</p><p>If it overlaps with your team’s work heavily then it might be best to make some subtle contingency plans: reducing your dependency on it or building abstractions to cope if it goes away. There is also a long game trick here. Even a bad project usually has an “essence” of a good idea, a specific problem it was trying to solve or an insight it was based on. If it fits with your job, it’s often a good idea to take that essence and see if you can naturally incorporate a better version of that specific solution into your own project. That way, if the bad project stalls or gets canceled, you can be proactive instead of reactive to the fallout.</p><p>Alternatively, if you’re not involved, it’s easy: just stay out of the picture. Vent to friendly colleagues in private, commiserate, but in public, live with the reality.</p><h3 id="managing-your-team-through-it">Managing your team through it</h3><p>Finally, you must manage your own team through the process. If you can see the flaws in a project, other senior engineers probably see them too. Don’t try to gaslight them or “walk the company line” by pretending a bad project is actually good. It destroys trust.</p><p>Instead, be honest about the facts on the ground without going into unnecessary political details. Tell them that you will do the best you can under these constraints.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>So what did I tell my mentee? “I’ve learned that being right and being effective are different things. I could go tell them my concerns. They probably wouldn’t listen. I’d burn some goodwill. And in six months, nobody will remember that I called it, they’ll just remember I was the guy who tried to block their work”.</p><p>When you’re earlier in your career, you want to believe that good ideas win on merit, that if you just explain clearly enough, people will see reason. It took me quite some time to accept that big companies don’t work that way.</p><p>But this doesn’t mean you stop caring. It means you get strategic about when to spend your credibility. Pick the battles where you can actually change the outcome, where your team will be hurt if you stay silent, where the cost of being wrong is low but the cost of the project failing is high.</p><p>And for everything else? You vent to colleagues, you make quiet contingency plans, and you watch. Sometimes you learn something. Sometimes you’re wrong and the project actually works. And sometimes you get to feel that grim satisfaction of predicting exactly how things would fall apart.</p><p>None of this is as satisfying as fixing everything. But it works and keeps me sane.</p></section></div>]]></description>

   <p>NUUK, Greenland — Troops from several European countries, including France, Germany, Norway and Sweden, are arriving in Greenland to help boost the Arctic island's security after talks between representatives of Denmark, Greenland and the U.S. on Wednesday highlighted "fundamental disagreement" between the Trump administration and European allies.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESG-S1-106113-100" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"The first French military elements are already en route" and "others will follow," French President Emmanuel Macron announced Wednesday, as French authorities said about 15 French soldiers from the mountain infantry unit were already in Nuuk for a military exercise.</p>   <p>Germany will deploy a reconnaissance team of 13 personnel to Greenland on Thursday, its Defense Ministry said.</p>   <p>Denmark announced it would increase its military presence in Greenland, with NATO allies joining them, just as the Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers met with White House representatives on Wednesday in Washington to discuss U.S. President Donald Trump's intentions to take over the island in order to tap its mineral resources and protect the security of the Arctic region amid rising Russian and Chinese interest.</p>   
   <p>On Thursday, Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said the intention was "to establish a more permanent military presence with a larger Danish contribution," according to Danish broadcaster DR. He said soldiers from several NATO countries will be in Greenland on a rotation system.</p>   <p>Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, flanked by his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt, said Wednesday that a "fundamental disagreement" over Greenland remains with Trump after they held highly anticipated talks at the White House with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p>   <p>Rasmussen added that it remains "clear that the president has this wish of conquering over Greenland."</p>   <p>"We really need it," Trump told media in the Oval Office after the meeting. "If we don't go in, Russia is going to go in and China is going to go in. And there's not a thing Denmark can do about it, but we can do everything about it."</p>   <p>Trump said he had not yet been briefed about the contents of the White House meeting when he made his remarks.</p>   <p>In Greenland's capital, Nuuk, local residents told The Associated Press they were glad the first meeting between Greenlandic, Danish and American officials had taken place but suggested it left more questions than answers.</p>   
   <p>Several people said they viewed Denmark's decision to send more troops, and promises of support from other NATO allies, as protection against possible U.S. military action. But European military officials have not suggested the goal is to deter a U.S. move against the island.</p>   <p>Maya Martinsen, 21, agreed and said it was "comforting to know that the Nordic countries are sending reinforcements" because Greenland is a part of Denmark and NATO.</p>   <p>The dispute, she said, is not about "national security" but rather about "the oils and minerals that we have that are untouched."</p>   <h3>More troops, more talks</h3>   <p>On Wednesday, Poulsen had announced a stepped-up military presence in the Arctic "in close cooperation with our allies," calling it a necessity in a security environment in which "no one can predict what will happen tomorrow."</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESG-S1-106113-101" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"This means that from today and in the coming time there will be an increased military presence in and around Greenland of aircraft, ships and soldiers, including from other NATO allies," Poulsen said.</p>   <p>Asked whether the European troop movements were coordinated with NATO or what role the U.S.-led military alliance might play in the exercises, NATO referred all questions to the Danish authorities.</p>   <p>However, NATO is looking at how members can collectively bolster the alliance's presence in the Arctic, according to a NATO official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>   <p>Rasmussen, the Danish foreign minister, announced the creation of a working group with the Americans to discuss ways to work through differences.</p>   <p>"The group, in our view, should focus on how to address the American security concerns, while at the same time respecting the red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark," he said.</p>   <p>Commenting on the outcome of the Washington meeting on Thursday, Poulsen said the working group was "better than no working group" and "a step in the right direction." He added nevertheless that the dialogue with the U.S. did not mean "the danger has passed."</p>   
   <p>Line McGee, a 38-year old from Copenhagen, told AP that she was glad to see some diplomatic progress. "I don't think the threat has gone away," she said. "But I feel slightly better than I did yesterday."</p>   <p>Speaking to FOX News Channel's Special Report on Wednesday after the White House talks, Rasmussen rejected both a military takeover and the potential purchase of the island by the U.S. Asked whether he thinks the U.S. will invade, he replied: "No, at least I do not hope so, because, I mean, that would be the end of NATO."</p>   <p>Rasmussen said Greenlanders were unlikely to vote for U.S. rule even if financial incentives were offered "because I think there's no way that U.S. will pay for a Scandinavian welfare system in Greenland, honestly speaking."</p>   <p>"You haven't introduced a Scandinavian welfare system in your own country," he added.</p>   <p>Trump, in his Oval Office meeting with reporters, said: "We'll see how it all works out. I think something will work out."</p>

همچنین می‌توانید از دکمه‌ “اشتراک گذاری” برای انتخاب یک برنامه جهت ارسال لینک استفاده کنید.</p>
<p>پیوندی که از مخاطبی که قصد اضافه کردن آن  را دارید را در فیلد متن زیر وارد کنید.
روی “ادامه” کلیک کرده و یک نام مستعار برای مخاطب جدید انتخاب کنید.</p>
<p>در ادامه، صفحه “درخواست های در حال انتظار مخاطب” را خواهید دید
که شما را در خصوص وضعیت هر مخاطب در حال انتظار مطلع می‌کند.
Briar تلاش خواهد کرد که تا به مخاطب شما به صورت منظم وصل شود تا آن ها را اضافه کند.</p>
<p>به محض اینکه اتصال برقرار شد، به فهرست مخاطبان یکدیگر اضافه خواهید شد.
تبریک! شما آماده‌ ارتباط امن می باشید.</p>
<p>اگر Briar پس از 48 ساعت نتوانست به مخاطب شما وصل شود، فهرست مخاطبان در انتظار پیام “افزودن مخاطب ناموفق بود” را خواهند دید. هر دو شما باید مخاطب در حال انتظار را از فهرست پاک کرده و پیوند های یکدیگر را دوباره اضافه کنید.</p>

<p>The UK just pulled off one of its most consequential offshore wind auctions yet – delivering massive volumes of new capacity at prices that undercut gas.</p>



<p>In its latest offshore wind allocation round (AR7), the UK awarded a record 8.4 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity, making it the largest-ever offshore wind auction in Europe. That includes 8.2 GW of bottom‑fixed projects and just under 200 megawatts (MW) of floating wind, enough clean power to supply the equivalent of nearly 10 million homes.</p>



<p>And it came in cheap.&nbsp;Thanks to intense competition, the average strike prices landed at £91.20 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in England and Wales and £89.49/MWh in Scotland. That’s well below the cost of building and running new fossil fuel or nuclear power in the UK.</p>



<p>For context, new gas plants in the UK are estimated to cost approximately £147/MWh, while new nuclear power plants come in at around £124/MWh. In other words, offshore wind from this auction is roughly 40% cheaper than gas and almost 30% cheaper than nuclear.</p>	
	



<p>The 8.4 GW of new offshore wind capacity will save consumers nearly £1.7 billion a year compared with relying on gas-fired power.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-highly-competitive-auction">A highly competitive auction</h3>



<p>AR7 was one of the most competitive offshore wind auctions ever held in Europe. A record 19 projects with a combined potential capacity of 24 GW were eligible to bid, driving prices down and underscoring just how far offshore wind costs have fallen.</p>



<p>In total, the auction awarded contracts to six bottom‑fixed offshore wind projects and two floating wind projects. The 192 MW of floating wind awarded may sound small, but it’s an important step toward advancing commercial‑scale floating wind – a technology seen as critical for deeper waters where traditional turbines won’t work.</p>



<p>The British government says the auction will unlock around £22 billion in private investment and support roughly 7,000 jobs across the UK.</p>



<h3 id="h-rwe-walks-away-the-big-winner">RWE walks away the big winner</h3>



<p>The clear standout in this round was German energy giant RWE, which secured contracts for nearly 7 GW of offshore wind capacity – by far the largest share of the auction.</p>



<p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/record-breaking-auction-for-offshore-wind-secured-to-take-back-control-of-britains-energy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>, “With these results, Britain is taking back control of our energy sovereignty. This is a historic win for those who want Britain to stand on our own two feet, controlling our own energy rather than depending on markets controlled by petrostates and dictators.</p>

The talent is there, the capital is certainly there, and the models are increasingly capable. And yet, the results are lopsided. Why is it that we have agents that can prospect for sales leads and answer support tickets accurately, but we don’t seem to be able to consistently generate high quality slides?</p><p>The simplest explanation might be complexity. Easier problems (e.g., answer a support question) naturally get solved first, and more open-ended problems like slide generation require more effort. That doesn’t quite hold up: Coding is obviously not a simple application area, and yet coding agents are some of the best that we have today – in fact, they are improving faster than any other single agent use case.</p><p><span>How did this happen? Ease of adoption enabled data collection at scale that in turn helped coding agents improve rapidly.Every developer could switch to Cursor in 5 minutes without any approval. That created a data flywheel (more on this below) that allowed the Cursor team to build a better application experience over time – to the point where our whole team now swears by Cursor’s </span><a href="https://cursor.com/blog/composer" rel="">Composer model</a><span> for code generation.</span></p><p>The combination of technical complexity and adoption difficulty creates an interesting 2x2:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MSwO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa3d039b-c0af-4458-838c-27a2c172ebdb_1600x900.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MSwO!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa3d039b-c0af-4458-838c-27a2c172ebdb_1600x900.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MSwO!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa3d039b-c0af-4458-838c-27a2c172ebdb_1600x900.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MSwO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa3d039b-c0af-4458-838c-27a2c172ebdb_1600x900.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MSwO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa3d039b-c0af-4458-838c-27a2c172ebdb_1600x900.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MSwO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa3d039b-c0af-4458-838c-27a2c172ebdb_1600x900.png" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/aa3d039b-c0af-4458-838c-27a2c172ebdb_1600x900.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MSwO!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa3d039b-c0af-4458-838c-27a2c172ebdb_1600x900.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MSwO!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa3d039b-c0af-4458-838c-27a2c172ebdb_1600x900.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MSwO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa3d039b-c0af-4458-838c-27a2c172ebdb_1600x900.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MSwO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa3d039b-c0af-4458-838c-27a2c172ebdb_1600x900.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>You might be tempted to think that being in one of the “easy to adopt” quadrants is the holy grail – after all, who doesn’t want more data to build better models? That is certainly a valid way to build a business, but the trap is that easy to adopt </span><em>also </em><span>means easy to displace. Hard to adopt products have their own data moat: Once you’re embedded in an enterprise, you learn about how </span><em>that company</em><span> works in a way that makes your product incredibly hard to replace.</span></p><p>Whichever quadrant you fall into, data is your only moat.</p><p><span>Easy to adopt and easy to solve is the most obvious quadrant to work in. It didn’t take an incredible amount of foresight to see back in 2023 that consumer search on Google would be replaced by custom answers to every question that a user has – whether it was finding a nice fact or providing healthcare advice. This has been the bread-and-butter use case for the foundation model providers and plenty of new entrants (e.g., Perplexity, </span><a href="http://you.com/" rel="">You.com</a><span>) flocked to these use cases as well.</span></p><p><span>The “easy to solve, easy to adopt” quadrant is a </span><strong>value trap</strong><span>. If the barrier to entry is low for you, it’s non-existent for frontier labs (or more likely, they’ve already built it). Given that these are the “obvious” use cases, they’re the ones for which the existing chat applications will see the highest volume of usage. That means that – whatever the use case is – OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic are gathering millions of data points to improve their models in these areas. Last week’s release of </span><a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-health/" rel="">ChatGPT Health</a><span> feels like an obvious step in this direction. Beyond data access, the model providers can also subsidize costs and leverage their massive user bases to learn any new application area quite quickly. In short, you very likely will get crushed by the model providers.</span></p><p><span>An interesting side note is that loyalty is quite low in this quadrant – we all </span><a href="https://www.interconnects.ai/p/use-multiple-models" rel="">use multiple chat agents</a><span> depending on the use case, and unlike with the web search market, everyone seems to be on relatively equal footing. If dominant brand leaders do emerge, we’d place our bets on the model providers.</span></p><p>Why did coding – ostensibly one of the hardest problems to solve! – see such rapid progress? Most importantly, it is because adoption was easy – you could see a ton of value by pasting a snippet of code into ChatGPT back in 2023, and Cursor quickly made that much easier even though quality was limited early on. Since every engineer typically has the freedom to choose their own IDE, switching from IntellIJ or VSCode to Cursor wasn’t a crazy lift. Once it was in place, it also had a very fast feedback loop – a software engineer might generate code with Cursor tens or hundreds of times a day. That created a data flywheel: Every accepted or rejected suggestion adds to training data for future model improvements. With this data in hand, it was inevitable that model quality would improve dramatically over time. Notably, other markets in this quadrant (e.g., slide generation) that don’t have the same fine-grained feedback loop have seen much slower improvements.</p><p>Anything in the “hard to solve” category is going to require significant investment – across token usage, technical talent, and likely eventually model training and RL. The ease of adoption is a powerful data acquisition flywheel that enables that deeper investment. The frontier model labs seem to view these kinds of widely used productivity agents as being in their domain. They’re already competing heavily on coding agents, and we would not be surprised to see them launch more office-suite productivity tools beyond the document editors they already have. In other words, our prediction is that these markets are going to have heavyweight fights – smaller players will struggle to compete without huge capital outlays.</p><p>Stickiness, however, continues to be low here. Many of us run multiple coding agents, and as office productivity tools improve, there’s no reason that you wouldn’t jump to whichever app makes you the prettiest slides. The argument for stickiness is company-specific customization (e.g., Cursor rules, brand templates), but it’s possible we will see interoperability or a single standard emerge to enable migration.</p><p>This is the area where enterprise adoption of AI has really taken off in the last two years. When we say easy to solve, we’re not implying that there’s no product depth, but it’s easy to imagine how an LLM can execute a playbook for an e-commerce return or a password reset. Given that most enterprises are looking for wins from AI, the “obvious” problems are where they’ve turned for immediate adoption. That’s enabled an incredible pace of revenue growth for the leaders in these markets.</p><p>Two key things differentiate this quadrant. First, these products are not individually adoptable – buying an agent to handle support tickets or IT helpdesk requests is an organization-level decision that likely has a buying committee. Second, the comparative simplicity of the use case is offset by the difficult and tedious reality of enterprise integrations. The teams that can navigate legacy enterprise systems have a huge leg up.</p><p><span>That integration story is where there’s a data moat. While the data you get from these agents is less broadly applicable – and enterprises will likely restrict your ability to train models with it – you’re gathering data about how </span><em>each customer</em><span> works. Over time, that will help you make your product at large better, but most importantly, your product will become stickier for each customer. The next agent that comes along will have a hard time recreating that learned expertise.</span></p><p><span>In this area, investors are treating the larger startups as </span><em>de facto</em><span> incumbents. That’s not to say that there isn’t product innovation left to be done – there very likely is! – but it’s not immediately obvious why a smaller startup would be able to compete with the likes of Sierra and Decagon, for example. What’s less clear is whether the capital these companies are raising is primarily being used to drive GTM or whether there is a clear technical moat that’s emerging, à la coding-specific models. If it’s only the former, then startups might have to resort to competing on cost.</span></p><p><em>Example apps: SRE, security ops</em></p><p>Hard to adopt, hard to solve problems have received (comparatively) the least attention out of all four quadrants. The potential value of solving complex engineering or operations workflows can be incredibly high, as these are tasks that typically take humans hours or days. Unfortunately, these are workflows that are also fairly custom on a company-by-company basis, which means evaluation and implementation are much more cumbersome than “easy to solve, hard to adopt” products.</p><p><span>We’ve placed </span><a href="https://www.runllm.com/product" rel="">our bet</a><span> in the hard-hard quadrant, and this is where we expect to see the next phase of growth. The hard-hard markets will grow very quickly in the next couple years for a handful of reasons. First, reasoning models are now capable of planning to handle more complex tasks, which will help grapple with multi-step solutions. Second, a lot of the complexity in solving these problems comes from the steps outside of AI – building and configuring workflows; that will get easier and faster as coding agents get better. Finally, enterprises are already actively plucking the low-hanging fruit and will look to harder problems once those run out.</span></p><p>The data moat here is the most complex and potentially the most valuable. If you build expertise in one company’s workflows, that becomes very difficult to replicate – switching products would be akin to firing an experienced engineer and replacing them with a new person. There’s potentially an opportunity to build expertise in core capabilities (e.g., an SRE agent that’s an expert in AWS). However, this improvement cycle will be significantly slower than it was with coding agents because the quantity of data is lower and verifiability is less obvious.</p><p>While every one of these markets has a company that has raised astronomical amounts of money (often well ahead of revenue growth), we have a hard time imagining that these companies are as entrenched as their equivalents in the “easy to solve, hard to adopt” category. There’s a very long game left to be played in this market.</p><p><span>This map isn’t set in stone; both boundaries will change. On the complexity front, we’ve seen dramatic improvements in model capabilities every few months. However, model improvements </span><a href="https://frontierai.substack.com/p/model-inference-model-products-and?utm_source=publication-search" rel="">seem to be plateauing</a><span>, so there’s less interest on this axis.</span></p><p><span>The real excitement is around UX. We’ve long believed that the UX aspects of AI applications are underexplored. We would not be surprised to see new UX paradigms developed that change the way users adopt products. </span><a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web" rel="">Claude Code on the web</a><span> is probably the best recent example of this – by making a coding agent available in a web browser available to everyone, it’s allowed users who might be scared away by an IDE or terminal to access these tools.</span></p><p>Regardless of what path they take, our bet is that the next 12-24 months will see the rise of winners in the hard-hard quadrant. It won’t look as seamless as the growth of Sierra and Decagon has been – there will be longer evaluation cycles, more complex implementations, and likely an overall lower success rate. But as companies improve their process and data enables improved models, this is where incredible amounts of revenue can be generated.</p></div></article></div><div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div><div><h3>Ready for more?</h3></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto"><strong>JuiceFS</strong> is a high-performance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX" rel="nofollow">POSIX</a> file system released under Apache License 2.0, particularly designed for the cloud-native environment. The data, stored via JuiceFS, will be persisted in Object Storage <em>(e.g. Amazon S3)</em>, and the corresponding metadata can be persisted in various compatible database engines such as Redis, MySQL, and TiKV based on the scenarios and requirements.</p>
<p dir="auto">With JuiceFS, massive cloud storage can be directly connected to big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and various application platforms in production environments. Without modifying code, the massive cloud storage can be used as efficiently as local storage.</p>

<p dir="auto">JuiceFS consists of three parts:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>JuiceFS Client</strong>: Coordinates Object Storage and metadata storage engine as well as implementation of file system interfaces such as POSIX, Hadoop, Kubernetes, and S3 gateway.</li>
<li><strong>Data Storage</strong>: Stores data, with supports of a variety of data storage media, e.g., local disk, public or private cloud Object Storage, and HDFS.</li>
<li><strong>Metadata Engine</strong>: Stores the corresponding metadata that contains information of file name, file size, permission group, creation and modification time and directory structure, etc., with supports of different metadata engines, e.g., Redis, MySQL, SQLite and TiKV.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs/blob/main/docs/en/images/juicefs-arch-new.png"><img src="https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs/raw/main/docs/en/images/juicefs-arch-new.png" alt="JuiceFS Architecture"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">JuiceFS can store the metadata of file system on different metadata engines, like Redis, which is a fast, open-source, in-memory key-value data storage, particularly suitable for storing metadata; meanwhile, all the data will be stored in Object Storage through JuiceFS client. <a href="https://juicefs.com/docs/community/architecture" rel="nofollow">Learn more</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs/blob/main/docs/en/images/data-structure-diagram.svg"><img src="https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs/raw/main/docs/en/images/data-structure-diagram.svg" alt="data-structure-diagram"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Each file stored in JuiceFS is split into <strong>"Chunk"</strong> s at a fixed size with the default upper limit of 64 MiB. Each Chunk is composed of one or more <strong>"Slice"</strong>(s), and the length of the slice varies depending on how the file is written. Each slice is composed of size-fixed <strong>"Block"</strong> s, which are 4 MiB by default. These blocks will be stored in Object Storage in the end; at the same time, the metadata information of the file and its Chunks, Slices, and Blocks will be stored in metadata engines via JuiceFS. <a href="https://juicefs.com/docs/community/architecture/#how-juicefs-store-files" rel="nofollow">Learn more</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs/blob/main/docs/en/images/how-juicefs-stores-files.svg"><img src="https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs/raw/main/docs/en/images/how-juicefs-stores-files.svg" alt="How JuiceFS stores your files"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When using JuiceFS, files will eventually be split into Chunks, Slices and Blocks and stored in Object Storage. Therefore, the source files stored in JuiceFS cannot be found in the file browser of the Object Storage platform; instead, there are only a chunks directory and a bunch of digitally numbered directories and files in the bucket. Don't panic! This is just the secret of the high-performance operation of JuiceFS!</p>

            <p>[<a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/?ref=werd.io">Joseph Cox at 404 Media</a>]</p><p>This is racial profiling on a grand scale:</p><blockquote>“Palantir is working on a tool for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier on each person, and provides a “confidence score” on the person’s current address, 404 Media has learned. ICE is using it to find locations where lots of people it might detain could be based.”</blockquote><p>It apparently looks a lot like Google Maps, but designed to show the richness of an area for “targets”, populated in part by density of immigrants. And then you can dig in:</p><blockquote>“Once a person is selected on the map interface, ELITE then shows a dossier on that particular person, according to the user guide. That includes their name, a photo, their Alien Number (the unique code given by the U.S. government to each immigrant), their date of birth, and their full address.”</blockquote><p>The Nazis could only dream of having such a capability.</p><p>Imagine working for this company, on this product. Every day, you go into work, in what I assume is a beautiful office with pine furniture and a well-stocked kitchen, and you build software that will help to deport people using what you know are extrajudicial means without due process. You probably have OKRs. There are customer calls with ICE. Every two-week sprint, you take on tasks that help make this engine better.</p><p>What do you tell yourself? What do you tell your family?</p><p>Are you on board with this agenda, or do you tell yourself you need the job to pay rent? To get healthcare?</p><p>You receive stock as part of your pay package. It’s going up! You can use it to buy a home, or to build a comfortable retirement, or some combination of the two.</p><p>Your co-workers are values aligned and work hard. They’re talented and smart. <em>Man,</em> you might think to yourself, <em>I love working with this team.</em></p><p>Or, you might think, <em>man, I’ve got to find another job.</em></p><p>Either way, you’re proud of your product work. You’re happy to take the salary, the free lunches, the espresso. And regardless of how you feel about it, the thing you do every day is powering an armed force that is kidnapping people on the street and shooting civilians, that shot a mother in the face, that is targeting people to disappear using a beautiful, modern map interface.</p><p>[<a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/?ref=werd.io">Link</a>]</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/wiz-research-codebreach-vulnerability-aws-codebuild">https://www.wiz.io/blog/wiz-research-codebreach-vulnerability-aws-codebuild</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46636093">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wiz Research uncovered <strong>CodeBreach</strong>, a critical vulnerability that placed the AWS Console supply chain at risk. The issue allowed a complete takeover of key AWS GitHub repositories - most notably the AWS JavaScript SDK, a core library that powers the AWS Console<strong>.</strong> By exploiting CodeBreach, <strong>attackers could have injected malicious code to launch a platform-wide compromise, potentially</strong> <strong>affecting not just the countless applications depending on the SDK, but the Console itself, threatening every AWS account</strong>.</p><figure></figure><p>The vulnerability stemmed from a subtle flaw in how the repositories’ <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/"><u>AWS CodeBuild</u></a> CI pipelines handled build triggers. Just two missing characters in a Regex filter allowed unauthenticated attackers to infiltrate the build environment and leak privileged credentials. This post breaks down how we leveraged this subtle misconfiguration to achieve a full repository takeover, and provides key<strong> </strong>recommendations for CodeBuild users to harden their own projects against similar attacks.</p><p>Wiz responsibly disclosed all findings to AWS, who promptly remediated the issue. AWS also implemented global hardening measures within the CodeBuild service to prevent similar attacks. Most notably, the new <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/pull-request-build-policy.html"><u>Pull Request Comment Approval</u></a> build gate offers organizations a simple and secure path to prevent untrusted builds. Read the AWS Advisory <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/2026-002-AWS/"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p>This issue follows a familiar pattern seen in recent supply-chain attacks like the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/s1ngularity-supply-chain-attack"><u>Nx S1ngularity</u></a> incident, where subtle CI/CD misconfigurations lead to disproportionately impactful attacks. Just last July, a threat actor abused a similar CodeBuild issue to <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2025-015/"><u>launch a supply chain attack</u></a> against users of the Amazon Q VS Code extension. This growing trend underscores the urgent need for organizations to harden their CI/CD pipelines.</p><figure></figure><h2><a id="required-actions-and-mitigations-6"></a><strong>Required Actions and Mitigations</strong></h2><p>While no immediate action is required by downstream consumers of the affected AWS GitHub repositories, we strongly recommend all AWS CodeBuild users implement the following safeguards to protect their own projects against similar issues.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Prevent Untrusted Pull Requests from Triggering Privileged Builds:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Enable the new <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/pull-request-build-policy.html"><u>Pull Request Comment Approval</u></a> build gate.</p></li><li><p>Alternatively, use <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/action-runner.html"><u>CodeBuild-hosted runners</u></a> to manage build triggers via GitHub workflows.</p></li><li><p>If you must rely on <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/webhooks.html"><u>webhook filters</u></a>, ensure their regex patterns are anchored.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Secure the CodeBuild-GitHub Connection</strong></p><ul><li><p>Generate a <strong>unique, fine-grained Personal Access Token (PAT)</strong> for each CodeBuild project.</p></li><li><p>Strictly limit the PAT's permissions to the <strong>minimum</strong> required, as listed <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/access-tokens-github.html"><u>here</u></a>.</p></li><li><p>Consider using a dedicated unprivileged GitHub account for the CodeBuild integration.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2><a id="find-vulnerable-codebuild-projects-with-wiz-9"></a>Find Vulnerable CodeBuild Projects with Wiz</h2><p>Wiz customers can find CodeBuild projects that trigger builds based on untrusted pull requests using this pre-built query in the <a href="https://app.wiz.io/boards/threat-center/wiz-adv-2026-002">Wiz Threat Intel Center</a>.</p><figure></figure><h2><a id="why-we-audited-codebuild-12"></a><strong>Why We Audited CodeBuild</strong></h2><p>Our investigation into AWS CodeBuild was sparked by the attempted <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2025-015/"><u>supply-chain attack</u></a> on the Amazon Q VS Code extension. In that incident, an attacker exploited a misconfigured CodeBuild project to compromise the extension’s GitHub repository and inject malicious code into the main branch. This code was then included in a release which users downloaded. Although the attacker’s payload ultimately failed due to a typo, it did execute on end users’ machines - clearly demonstrating the risk of misconfigured CodeBuild pipelines.</p><p>CodeBuild is a managed CI service that’s commonly connected to GitHub repositories, triggering builds on events like new pull requests. To interact with GitHub, CodeBuild requires <strong>GitHub credentials</strong>, which are, by default, present in the memory of the build environment. This creates a critical risk: if an attacker can compromise a single build, they are just a memory dump away from stealing credentials that often possess powerful permissions over the source repository.</p><h2><a id="to-build-or-not-to-build-the-pull-request-problem-15"></a>To Build or Not To Build: The Pull Request Problem&nbsp;</h2><p>The most common way to compromise a CI build is through a pull request. An attacker forks the target repository, adds malicious code, and then opens a PR against the original project. If CodeBuild is configured to spawn builds on PR events, it will trigger a build based on the attacker's branch. In the vast majority of build systems like make or yarn, controlling the source code of a build process is enough to run arbitrary code. This is the exact mechanism the attacker exploited to compromise the Amazon Q extension.</p><figure></figure><p>To prevent this attack scenario, CodeBuild offers <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/github-webhook.html"><u><strong>webhook filters</strong></u></a> - a set of rules that an event must meet to trigger a build. Back in August, these filters were the primary defense against untrusted pull requests. Among the available options, the go-to solution was the <strong>ACTOR_ID</strong> filter: an allow-list of approved GitHub user IDs that ensures only trusted users can trigger a build.</p><p>This seemed like a robust defense, but maintaining a list of user IDs can be cumbersome. We wondered: were organizations actually using this filter correctly?</p><p>To find out, we decided to search for GitHub repositories connected to <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/public-builds.html"><u><strong>Public CodeBuild projects</strong></u></a>. When set to public, CodeBuild projects expose their settings via a publicly accessible dashboard and automatically link to it in the status of any commit that triggers a build. From the dashboard, anyone can view the project's build logs and configurations - including the exact webhook filters being used.</p><figure></figure><h2><a id="an-apparent-dead-end-22"></a>An Apparent Dead End</h2><p>Our initial scan was promising. We quickly found seven AWS-owned repositories with public CodeBuild pages. Of those, four were active and configured to run builds on pull requests:</p><ul><li><p>The AWS SDK for JavaScript (<code>aws/aws-sdk-js-v3</code>)</p></li><li><p>AWS Libcrypto (<code>aws/aws-lc</code>)</p></li><li><p>Amazon Corretto Crypto Provider (<code>corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider</code>)</p></li><li><p>The Registry of Open Data on AWS (<code>awslabs/open-data-registry</code>)</p></li></ul><p>At first glance, everything seemed secure. All four projects implemented an <code>ACTOR_ID</code> filter, locking down builds to a list of approved maintainers. It appeared to be a dead end.</p><figure></figure><p>But the filter's syntax, shown above, was unusual for a typical ID list. The user IDs weren’t separated by commas or spaces, but by a pipe <strong>|</strong> character. That small detail was the key: in regular expressions, the <strong>|</strong> character means "OR". Reviewing the documentation confirmed it: the filter wasn't a simple list, <strong>it was a regex pattern</strong>. And it had a fatal flaw.</p><h2><a id="unanchored-how-a-subtle-flaw-led-to-ci-compromise-28"></a><strong>Unanchored: How a Subtle Flaw Led to CI Compromise</strong></h2><p>The issue was simple but critical: <strong>the regex patterns weren’t anchored</strong>. Without the start <code>^</code> and end <code>$</code> anchors to require an exact match, a regex engine doesn't look for a string that perfectly matches the pattern, but one that merely <em>contains</em> it. This meant that any GitHub user ID that is a superstring of an approved ID could bypass the filter.</p><p>This was a powerful primitive in theory, but its success depended on a practical question: is it possible to register a brand-new GitHub user ID that contained the ID of an existing user?</p><h2><a id="when-ids-align-31"></a>When IDs Align</h2><p>The answer is yes, and it hinges on how GitHub assigns IDs. Every user is given a unique and <strong>sequential numeric ID</strong>. Early accounts from 2008 have 5-digit IDs, while accounts from recent years ballooned to 9-digit IDs. As this sequence of numbers grows, it's inevitable that shorter, older IDs appear as substrings within longer, newer ones.</p><p>Based on our tests, GitHub creates roughly <strong>200,000</strong> new IDs each day. At that rate, for any given 6-digit maintainer ID, a new, longer ID containing it would become available for registration approximately <strong>every five days</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>We dubbed this recurring window of opportunity an <strong>"eclipse" </strong>-- the moment a new, longer ID perfectly "shadowed" a trusted maintainer's ID.</p><figure></figure><p>All four AWS repositories had short maintainer IDs only 6 or 7 digits long, resulting in frequent eclipses that made them all valid targets.&nbsp;</p><h2><a id="catching-an-eclipse-winning-the-race-for-a-target-id-37"></a>Catching an Eclipse: Winning the Race for a Target ID</h2><p>Having confirmed that a new GitHub ID could contain a maintainer's ID, the challenge became operational: how could we claim a specific ID the instant it became available? This was practically a race condition against the entire world, with roughly two new GitHub users created every second. We needed a way to create a lot of GitHub users at once.</p><p>The standard user sign-up flow is protected by reCAPTCHA, making automated account creation impossible. We needed a different approach.</p><h3><a id="attempt-1-organizations-for-id-sampling-40"></a>Attempt #1: Organizations for ID Sampling</h3><p>Our first thought was to use the GitHub Enterprise API to create organizations, which share the same ID pool as users. While this could allow us to claim the target ID, GH organization accounts can't open pull requests, making them useless for the final exploit. It wasn't a total dead end though. We repurposed this API into an <strong>ID sampling tool</strong>: we could create an organization, check its ID to see how close we were to the target ID, and then immediately delete it.</p><h3><a id="the-breakthrough-the-github-app-manifest-flow-42"></a>The Breakthrough: The GitHub App Manifest Flow</h3><p>The real breakthrough came from <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com/en/apps/overview"><u>GitHub Apps</u></a>. Creating an app generates a corresponding bot user (e.g. app-name[bot]) that <em>can</em> interact with pull requests. It’s also possible to automate app creation via the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com/en/apps/sharing-github-apps/registering-a-github-app-from-a-manifest"><u>manifest flow</u></a>. While it’s composed of a few steps, it can be made <strong>atomic</strong>: the app and its bot are only created when a final confirmation URL is visited.&nbsp;</p><p>This allowed us to prepare hundreds of app creation requests in advance and then, at the precise moment, visit all their confirmation URLs simultaneously.&nbsp;</p><p>With our strategy in place, it was time to execute. We routinely used the organization-creation API to sample the current GitHub ID, allowing us to accurately predict the moment of the eclipse. We also initiated the manifest flow for 200 new GitHub Apps, collecting their unique confirmation URLs.&nbsp;</p><p>We waited until the live ID count was just ~100 IDs away from the target ID, and then visited all 200 URLs at once, triggering a flood of new bot user registrations. The target ID was 226755743, which contained a trusted maintainer ID for the <code>aws/aws-sdk-js-v3 </code>repository.</p><p>After the registrations completed, a quick check confirmed our success:</p><figure></figure><p>We’d captured a user ID that could bypass the <code>ACTOR_ID </code>filter, and the method was reliable enough to be successfully repeated for each of the four target repositories.</p><h2><a id="from-bypass-to-admin-executing-the-takeover-50"></a><strong>From Bypass to Admin: Executing the Takeover</strong></h2><p>With our bot user able to bypass the ACTOR_ID filter, we were ready to execute the proof-of-concept. We chose to target the <code>aws/aws-sdk-js-v3 </code>repository, preparing a pull request that fixes a legitimate issue. Buried within the PR was the real payload: a new NPM package dependency designed to execute in the build environment and extract the GitHub credentials.</p><p>We submitted the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/pull/7280"><u>PR</u></a>, and soon after received a notification: <strong>a build had been triggered</strong>. Moments later, <strong>we had successfully obtained the GitHub credentials of the </strong><code><strong>aws-sdk-js-v3</strong></code><strong> CodeBuild project.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>(If you're up for a challenge, try to find the commit in the PR that triggered the build.)</em></p><p>Our payload retrieved the GH token by dumping the memory of a process within the build environment. A <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/aws-2025-016/"><u>previous memory dump mitigation</u></a> in CodeBuild, which AWS implemented in response to the Amazon Q incident, overlooked this particular process. Following our disclosure, CodeBuild now protects this process as well. While this is a welcomed improvement, it isn’t bulletproof. GitHub credentials still reside in the build’s memory, and attackers with Linux privilege escalation exploits can circumvent memory protections. That’s why the most robust mitigation is using build gates to prevent untrusted builds from running in the first place.</p><h2><a id="the-blast-radius-55"></a>The Blast Radius&nbsp;</h2><p>The credentials we obtained were a GitHub Classic Personal Access Token (PAT) belonging to the <code>aws-sdk-js-automation</code> user. For an attacker, this was the perfect user to compromise, as it regularly interacts with the repository and releases new versions to GitHub:</p><figure></figure><p>We quickly confirmed that the <code>aws-sdk-js-automation </code>user had <strong>full admin privileges</strong> over the repository. Initially though, our access was scoped by the token's permissions: <code>repo</code> and <code>admin:repo_hook</code>. To escalate privileges, we abused the token’s <code>repo</code> scope, which can manage repository collaborators, and invited our own GitHub user to be a repository administrator.</p><figure></figure><p>As administrators, we could now push code directly to the main branch, approve any pull request, and exfiltrate repository secrets.</p><figure></figure><p>This level of control provided a clear path for supply chain attacks. The JavaScript SDK is released on a weekly basis to GitHub and then to NPM. Abusing this frequent release schedule, attackers could have injected malicious payloads right before a release was published, compromising it. Just a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4027963/hacker-inserts-destructive-code-in-amazon-q-as-update-goes-live.html"><u>month prior</u></a>, a threat actor using this exact method successfully infected downstream users of the Amazon Q VS Code extension.&nbsp;</p><p>While the Amazon Q incident was serious, the potential impact here was exponentially greater. <strong>&nbsp;Based on our analysis, a staggering 66% of cloud environments include the JavaScript SDK</strong> - meaning two out of every three environments host an instance with the SDK installed.<strong> </strong>It’s an exceptionally prominent software library, and among its users is perhaps the cloud’s most critical application: <strong>The AWS Console itself</strong>. Moreover, the Console bundles recent SDK versions; the image below shows a request from the console which includes user credentials and uses an SDK version released just 18 days prior:</p><figure></figure><p>Beyond the <code>aws-sdk-js-v3 </code>repository, the token we obtained had <strong>full admin privileges </strong>over several other repositories related to the JavaScript SDK. Among them were <strong>three private repositories</strong>, including what appeared to be AWS’s private mirrors of the JavaScript SDK. At this point though, given the demonstrated takeover and its potential impact, we halted further research and immediately reported the issues to AWS.</p><p>Crucially, this vulnerability extended beyond the SDK.<strong> </strong>While we only performed the CI takeover on the <code>aws-sdk-js-v3</code> repository, the same <code>ACTOR_ID </code>filter bypass was present in at least three other AWS GitHub repositories. Threat actors could have exploited these to compromise the GH credentials for three additional GH accounts. Two were automation accounts like <code>aws-sdk-js-automation</code>, but one was <strong>a personal GitHub account of an AWS employee</strong>.</p><h2><a id="conclusion-67"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>This vulnerability is a textbook example of why adversaries target CI/CD environments: a subtle, easily overlooked flaw that can be exploited for massive impact. We've seen this exact pattern in the recent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/s1ngularity-supply-chain-attack"><u><strong>Nx S1ngularity</strong></u></a> and Amazon Q supply-chain attacks.&nbsp;</p><p>This trend is no accident. Attackers are increasingly drawn to CI/CD systems because they represent an ideal target:</p><ol><li><p>They’re<strong> complex</strong>, making them prone to subtle misconfigurations;</p></li><li><p>They <strong>handle untrusted data</strong>, often testing code from external contributors;</p></li><li><p>They’re <strong>highly privileged</strong>, requiring powerful credentials to access code, publish artifacts, and deploy to the cloud.</p></li></ol><p>This combination of complexity, untrusted data, and privileged credentials creates a perfect storm for high-impact breaches that require no prior access.</p><p>The success of recent attacks serves as a critical wake-up call. Adversaries have already shifted their focus to CI/CD pipelines, and defenders are trailing behind. Addressing this threat requires a joint effort: organizations need to reduce pipeline privileges and implement stricter build gates, and CI/CD platforms should make these secure baselines straightforward to adopt. For security teams, the first step is to enforce a simple yet powerful principle: <strong>untrusted contributions should never trigger privileged pipelines.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><a id="statement-from-aws-73"></a><strong>Statement from AWS</strong></h2><blockquote><p>AWS investigated all reported concerns highlighted by Wiz’s research team in "Infiltrating the AWS Console Supply Chain: Hijacking Core AWS GitHub Repositories via CodeBuild." In response, AWS took a number of steps to mitigate all issues discovered by Wiz, as well as additional steps and mitigations to protect against similar possible future issues. The core issue of actor ID bypass due to unanchored regexes for the identified repos was mitigated within 48 hours of first disclosure. Additional mitigations were implemented, including further protections of all build processes that contain Github tokens or any other credentials in memory. In addition, AWS audited all other public build environments to ensure that no such issues exist across the AWS open source estate. Finally, AWS audited the logs of all public build repositories as well as associated CloudTrail logs and determined that no other actor had taken advantage of the unanchored regex issue demonstrated by the Wiz research team. AWS determined there was no impact of the identified issue on the confidentiality or integrity of any customer environment or any AWS service.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We would like to thank Wiz’s research team for their work in identifying this issue and their responsible collaboration with us to ensure that our customers remain protected and secure.</p></blockquote><h2><a id="responsible-disclosure-timeline-76"></a><strong>Responsible Disclosure Timeline&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><strong>August 25th, 2025</strong> – Wiz Research reports the actor ID bypass and repo takeover to AWS.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>August 25th, 2025</strong> – AWS and Wiz meet to review the findings and discuss mitigations.</p><p><strong>August 27th, 2025</strong> – AWS anchors the vulnerable actor ID filters and revokes the personal access token of <code>aws-sdk-js-automation</code>.</p><p><strong>September 2025</strong> – AWS implements additional hardening to prevent non-privileged builds from accessing the project’s credentials via memory dumping.</p><p><strong>January 15th, 2026</strong> – Public disclosure.</p><h2><a id="stay-in-touch-82"></a><strong>Stay in touch!</strong></h2><p>Hi there!

<div><p>I think part of the problem is the stuff you’re suggesting. I think everyday life needs to happen organically and if everything is scheduled and regimented and needs to be planned for, it’s very hard for the vast majority of people to actually accomplish. In the past the way, this worked was you went to church which was societally and peer enforced. People need to have marriages that last a lifetime. It’s my opinion that marriages that are a partnership without any sort of hierarchy like we had in the past are essentially doomed to fail except in a small percentage of cases. You need to have kids with stable homes that can go out on the street and be outside all day without fear of crime. Extended families need to live close to each other so there are a lot of folks raising kids and approaching life’s every day problems together. You need to shut off indoor sources of entertainment like social media and video gaming. You need to have a solid education system that is factual and science based, and only lets kids get through on the basis of meritocracy so they can be good informed citizens, and not vote for populist nonsense like we currently have. In a nutshell, what I’m trying to say is people cannot act on what’s best for them but society can put enough peer pressure on everyone for everyone’s good. This might be very hard to listen to in an individualistic society like ours and I don’t even know if I would want to live in this society, but I believe that if that’s the only option, everyone is better off.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46635483"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46635483" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46635483&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>I'm also in this group, so I have a few theories as to what causes it and how to fix it.</p><p>For one thing, I was severely traumatized as a kid, which delayed a lot of my social skills. I'm catching up but not all the way there yet. When my social battery is full, I can do pretty well, but if I'm even a little down, it's basically impossible to act normally.</p><p>I also had it hammered into me as a kid that nobody wants me around, nobody could ever love me, I'm a failure, a burden, a creep, a weirdo, and nothing but a bothersome nuisance that nobody would ever want to spend 30 seconds alone with. I'm trying to reject these thoughts, but it's difficult when you have nobody to talk to. It's like pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. I wonder how many people have the same issue. I've made a few friends in person, but I rarely get to see them.</p><p>Well I've started doing public surveys in my nearby big city, and documenting the results. I just hold out a posterboard that says "how alone do you feel"[1] or "have you ever been in love" etc, and hold out a marker, and people come up and take the survey. At first I did this out of sheer loneliness and boredom. But I have done it for enough months that some people have come up to me and told me that I've helped them, or that they look forward to my signs.</p><p>I'm trying to reach those people who feel the way I feel have no way of connecting with anyone, or at least feel that they don't. Do you have any new ideas of how to achieve this?</p><p>[1] <a href="https://chicagosignguy.com/blog/how-alone-do-you-feel.html" rel="nofollow">https://chicagosignguy.com/blog/how-alone-do-you-feel.html</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46637665"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637665" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637665&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>Hey, I love you.</p><p>Since I was a small child, my grandfather used to beat me savagely and shake me and pin me to the ground, screaming that the devil was inside of me and that I would never be capable of loving or being loved. This was literally beaten into me. He'd beat me with the buckle end of the belt, like a whip, hitting my face, arms, whatever he could. He'd keep beating me until I couldn't cry anymore, telling me that men are not supposed to cry, and that it was his responsibility to teach me not to cry. I flashback at least once a day to it.</p><p>But, he was wrong. I love a lot. So much that sometimes it's unbearable. I cry all the time. Sometimes out of pure love for someone. And there are people who I think love me. Of course the doubt is permanently sewn in. But my heart goes out to you, seriously. I love you just for existing and being yourself, and I hope you're okay.

<div><p>I've posted this thought a few times in different ways, but in my experience, community is found and <i>then</i> built.</p><p>Regularly sharing space with others is the way to start finding community. I think your surveying is an example of that. The next step is when the interactions begin taking place outside of the regular time/place, as evidenced by your epilogue.</p><p>What I haven't posted before is anything about how to <i>successfully</i> create those connections. Maybe we get lucky and someone will share our taste in music or movies or what have you, and the connection will be almost effortless. But to increase the rate of connection, I've found that learning to ask good questions is key.</p><p>We can learn a lot from popular interviewers like Terry Gross, Johnny Carson, or James Lipton. But to provide some direct tips: Lead with open-ended questions (i.e. not "yes or no"). Ask follow-up questions. Share a little bit while asking questions (e.g. "I'm not really into X music, more Y. Where would I start if I wanted to listen to X?")</p><p>Of course, sometimes friendships just aren't meant to be. It's tough, and can feel like a waste of time to have made the connection, but I've been surprised multiple times when a conversation that seemed like a slog of a one-off led to fruitful friendships later.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46637637"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637637" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637637&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I'm no fan of religion, but the situation you described is true for pretty much all social hobbies. It's just one of the early steps in making friends. First you do stuff, then you meet people through that stuff forming acquaintances. Then you spend some time forming setting-specific friendships. It's fine to have lots of these, but the next step is to break out of that specific setting. Starting with immediate invitations to adjacent events ("Hey, want to grab dinner after our workout?", "Want to grab lunch after church?", "Hey, want to hit the bar after work?"). Once you have a habit of doing that, you can escalate to invitations to non-adjacent events. ("Want to go to a concert this weekend?").

<div><p>Social media and on demand media hijack the emotional triggers that would usually be resolved by talking to people. Some examples:</p><p>* In line at the BMV, bored and feeling lonely. Should resolve loneliness by talking to strangers in line... mostly chit-chat, but sometimes you make a friend! Social media turns this into doom scrolling.</p><p>* Sitting in the living room by yourself, feeling a little lonely. Should result in calling up a friend or relative, or heading to get a coffee/beer where you can interact with people. On demand media turns this into low risk watching shows (yes, old school TV was an option, but on demand, there's always something on that is interesting).</p><p>So the trick is to make yourself ask if you should give someone a call or go somewhere public when you are pulling out the phone with intent to scroll or watch a show. When you find something you are interested in because you are watching lots of videos about it, or replying on forums, force yourself to engage in the real world. If you are arguing politics, find a group advocating your position and get involved (I've got to meet three majority leaders and two Presidents, plus a bunch of congresspeople you see on the news all the time as a side effect of getting involved because I was pissed off on the internet about business taxation issues). If you find a hobby, find a local group that does that. Learning to play the guitar from YouTube was fun, but jamming with other musicians? Off the charts fun and far more educational that just playing along with videos.</p><p>Finally, and this is the big one, try to never eat meals alone. Never say no to going to lunch with coworkers.  Join stuff that meets for breakfast. Dinners are hard, but it's surprising what happens when you invite a couple people over for dinner and a beer once in a while.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46637280"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637280" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637280&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

I wonder how do I say no to a stranger asking me for money. Or fear of getting robbed. It's not like my camera gear is that expensive but yeah. This would push me to get out there more as I've lived in the same place for 10 yrs and I haven't really explored/gone around much. Other than when I did Uber Eats, I would go all over the place. I would get wasted/drink at bars but end up with nothing end of the day, temporary day-long friends.</p><p>Funny I was at the gym yesterday, guy said hello to me, as a guy that keeps to himself usually (unless around friends) I gave him a bad look (not on purpose) and then I responded.

But yeah real friends I think I have 4 or 5 lifelong real friends. Women nothing, haven't been laid in like 12 years pretty said to say. Unfortunately it's something I value myself like "I'm a loser by not getting laid". Even though rest of my life is good, 2BR apt, sporty car, six-fig job, but yeah. It's my social awkardness, but I lift/improve myself, cutting down on weight I want abs. Idk I'm not going after women anymore either just trying to live life now, do shit, get out of debt, get out of 9-5, mental freedom.</p><p>It's funny if it's guys I'm very "charismatic" like I can be "everyone's friend" which doesn't work out due to conflicting interest. To that end it's really about taking an active interest in the other person, engaging them, asking them questions and remembering.</p><p>My thing with women is I don't get along with them like a guy (where I don't want anything from them physically).

<div><p>Hear me out. Its not just social awkwardness. You're experiencing class boundaries and do not seem to have the right mentality to bridge the gap.</p><p>First, you call homeless people bums, which sets the stage for how you see and treat them.</p><p>I'm an excellent engineer, but I was abused and impoverished as a child, homeless as a teenager. During my 20s, I started a few companies but my savings have been continually depleted taking care of family members. I don't have a sports car or a big bank account, or nice cameras. When I see a stranger or homeless person, I smile and wave. I keep cash on me so that I always have some to give out. I buy people lunch and sit on the curb eating with them and attempting to understand them. I learn the names of my local homeless folk and ingratiate myself in the community. I've moved to a few cities so I've had the opportunity to do this a few times.</p><p>I don't do this because I lack social anxiety; I sometimes have extreme agoraphobia, to the point that I have to hype myself up for hours just to go to the grocery store, and I have to wear noise-cancelling headphones to reduce the amount of stimulation. I have PTSD. I'm an extreme introvert. A hermit at times.</p><p>But what saves me is the philosophical understanding that I have a duty to the social contract. That empathy and direct aid are nonnegotiable parts of being human. I've been homeless and I know what it's like to be truly hopeless and live a life of uncertainty, fear and hunger.</p><p>You need to bridge that gap. Class-induced anxiety is real and I acknowledge that it's probably difficult, but it's not an excuse. You sound like you're in a position to change someone's life.

This is a very mature, balanced take.  If I may advise: Try some experiments on yourself.  You already know how you feel and how you socialise without drinking.  Try drinking various amounts in different social settings.  How does it feel?  Do you like yourself and your life more before?  Then go back.  Else, continue experimenting until you find a sweet spot.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46638233"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46638233" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46638233&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

But if the statistics are right and nearly everyone is somewhat lonely, we should expect that the required adjustments feel “drastic” compared to the current norm.</p><p>People would be less lonely if they could live in a community of 15-20 families with (1) shared space and (2) shared expectations for working together on their shared space.</p><p>[0] <a href="https://iambateman.com/tiny" rel="nofollow">https://iambateman.com/tiny</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46637835"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637835" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637835&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>I posted on another subthread but I think this is largely an excuse. If you live in a typical suburb you have 15-20 families on your street.

<div><p>There are, of course, multiple causes for loneliness. We can't fix them all with one clear action. Here are the main five, in my view:</p><p>First, social media. It's too easy to temporarily forget about your loneliness by staying home and doomscrolling or watching TV.</p><p>Second, increased mobility. People move around the whole continent now for work, removing them from their closest and oldest social connections.</p><p>Third, God is dead. Churches as community centers are dying out. Young people don't trust them anymore, because they don't believe in God, and because churches had many scandals. Secular community centers are very rare and struggle with funding.</p><p>Fourth, work is more stressful now. There used to be more time to socialize, but in our quest for productivity, work became denser with fewer idle times.</p><p>Fifth, fewer people want to have kids. Much has been written about this.</p><p>Now what can we do at societal scale? First of all, study the phenomenon more closely. Who is lonely? Who isn't? Which interventions work? Which cultural factors are important?
At your local scale, you can just call or meet a friend.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46637944"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637944" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637944&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>The common denominator is to have shared spaces where it's expected to be among strangers' presence, and for those strangers to eventually become repeat guests in a person's life. That's the maximally comfortable scenario for inducing social behavior and it's responsible for eons of human social history. Think church.</p><p>The problem there is that it's the responsibility of groups or society to arrange that. There's not much that a single lonely person can do there.</p><p>The less common denominator, that an individual may partake in until society concocts a better solution, is to intentionally visit <i>existing</i> shared spaces even where they otherwise wouldn't (hint: bouldering gyms are good for this because there are repeat faces as well as a social okay-ness to congratulating strangers, or asking how certain challenges can be solved).</p><p>Or break with convention, comfort, and perhaps etiquette, and instead just <i>talk to people</i>. Even outside of those spaces. (This is the advice that will piss a lot of people off if it's presented as their only option.) This advice is horrible until it isn't. It does, with enough practice, 'just work'.</p><p>---</p><p>For an entrepreneur or organizer: it would just go a long way to think about things in terms of allowing conversation to happen unimpeded. Pay attention to where people talk, and about what. Conversations happen a lot in hallways but famously by water coolers, perhaps because it affords people enough time in a shared space to muster the internal capital to start a conversation.</p><p>In college I ran a forum for people to meet others and some of the most self-reportedly successful participants just asked questions into the void and were surprised by the number of responses.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46638035"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46638035" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46638035&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>This is a difficult problem to want to solve. Some of it has to do with low income or joblessness. So this is the first focus I would set - make income easier to come by, more fair, more distributed. This in itself will not fix the solo state of people but it would alleviate some worries. Then we have to tackle the social problem. This is really difficult to want to solve. Activity helps, so the state should be able to encourage more activity overall. For instance, in my own youth I was physically more active, so you meet a lot of people through sports - that alone works fairly well. You can probably think of many more cohesive social structures and what not. I think it is a difficult to want to solve problem though.

<div><p>I'll add another suggestion: be more forgiving.</p><p>Anecdote: I had a friend in SF. He and I would hang out once in a while, and I always looked forward to these hangouts (we'd meet up for coffee, or go for a walk, hang out at Dolores Park, etc.). He is gay, I'm not. His perspective on things was often quite different than mine and I found that interesting. I got married, he stayed single. Even after marriage we would still hang out (though not as often as before). Then we had a child, which sucked all spare time out of my life; but even then we hung out once in a while. Then one winter there was cold/flu/COVID going around. We planned on hanging out and I unfortunately bailed on him at the last moment. This happened 2 more times. Then that bout of illnesses passed and I reached out to him to hang out again. But this time he seemed cold and distant. So I dropped it. And I didn't see him again for  almost 3 years.</p><p>Then one day I ran into him while walking through Dolores Park. He didn't see me, but I hesitated and still hollered out at him, for old times' sake. He responded and walked over. We chatted a little, I gave him a parting hug and we agreed to hang out again.</p><p>A couple of weeks later we managed to hang out again. What I gathered from our meeting was that he had been miffed at what he thought was me blowing him off; and I, when I felt he was cold and distant, had misread his grief at losing his cat. We both misread each other and wasted 3 years.</p><p>Moral of the story that I took away from it was: be more forgiving. Friendships are worth the extra effort.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46638295"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46638295" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46638295&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I think people in general need to stop letting differences rip them apart from each other.  I've seen countless friendships crumble over stupid things like politics.  (I'm not saying politics is stupid overall, but I <i>do</i> think it's stupid to let it affect a relationship, except in extreme situations).  I'm not talking about the Neo-Nazi who openly expresses hatred towards other races, or the extreme other end who insists that anything other than full throated and vocal activism makes you a bad person.  Those people are toxic and should be avoided.  IME that's like 1% of the population if not less.</p><p>Social media has (IMHO) exacerbated this by allowing us to selectively surround ourselves with people we know we'll agree with.  It's a nice reprieve sometimes, but it's so, so unhealthy beyond short-term.</p><p>Also talking to people in-person is very important.  The less you do it, the harder it is, but it's worth doing.  The natural humanizing effect of conversing with a person in meat-space does wonders for increasing understanding.  Don't talk about topics you disagree on, focus on agreements and common interests.  A good friend of mine is a trans-woman married to a woman.  She decided to get into target shooting and approached others in good faith, and she said something like (not a direct quote):  "I was worried they would be assholes, but it turns out they're just nerds like me, they just love to kit out their rigs".</p><p>Another friend of mine fell into the right-wing youtube rabbit-hole and "infiltrated" an Antifa group.  He's a good guy overall, but got a very clouded exposure to "the other side."  After he was done, he said something like (not a direct quote) "I was actually really surprised at how accepting, respectful, and intellectual most of them were.  We wouldn't agree on politics, but they were a lot more interested in real analysis and dealing in facts than I ever would have thought, and we ended up having some good conversations."</p><p>Yes there are going to be assholes out there, but give people a chance before jumping to conclusions.  You might be surprised!  Don't jump in the deep end all at once, and be mindful of personal danger and comfort-level, but don't be so afraid to reach out to humans (in-person) and try to connect, even if you think on the surface there's no way you could get along.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46638667"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46638667" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46638667&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I normally don't contribute to HN comments these days (too much anger in the comments section) but I appreciate your post and activities.</p><p>I am a tail-end boomer in the U.S. so my experiences were with a world where socializing was more functional:  we shopped in public, played in public, read in public libraries, watched movies in public, rode transit together, etc.  Being in public was a requirement, not a choice.  While there are still remnants of this older culture still active in today's world in urban life, there are so many options for not being in public that it is simply easier to avoid it.  We all want our space in one degree or another.</p><p>On the playground growing up, my world was filled with name-calling and backbiting.  I was a heavier kid, so that was my burden.  Other kids had bucked teeth, warts, limps, they were too short, or too tall, uncoordinated--whatever--nobody really escaped the wrath of the crowd.  We were forced, by our parents, to just deal with it.</p><p>My parents like many others in their generation recognized this behavior for what it was--natural.  Watch an episode of the Little Rascals--you will see what I am referring to.</p><p>Most if not all of those kids who were called names and isolated in some way found ways to break out of their pigeon hole: playing sports, playing music, making art, studying hard at school, boxing, singing, dancing, cracking jokes, whatever.  Then they were heroes, and the crowd could celebrate them--and they thrived.</p><p>I know this sounds overly idealistic, but it is true.  I experienced this first hand in a neighborhood of several hundred kids from broken homes, poor homes, ethnic homes, etc.</p><p>Voiceless people must find their voice.  The responsibility is their's.  The crowd will not come to the rescue of the person who won't stand up for themselves and make their way in life.</p><p>Loneliness is very, very sad.  The cure to loneliness is in the powerful hands of the lonely person.  Do whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to work on those things that hold the lonely person back from achieving something--anything--for themselves and then engage with the crowd with more confidence.</p><p>I appreciate what you are doing by helping others--that is one of your superpowers.  Live a good, strong life!</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46638353"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46638353" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46638353&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

In modern life, your bills, grocery shopping, car registration, hobbies, etc. can all be handled online / in your home.</p><p>In my opinion, it takes a lot of time and energy to avoid loneliness in the modern era.

<div><p>I dont know the solution but few things that are root cause:</p><p>- Internet and Social Media</p><p>- Neighborhoods no longer are walkable especially suburbs at least in America. Kids are not encouraged to go bike to their friends place anymore because of traffic risks.</p><p>- High Trust societies have degraded into "lets keep ot myself, I can't trust anyone these days". Decades ago, you could just walk into a neighbor's home and say hello. Now, you need an appointment just to talk to a neighbor or are too worried what they will think of you.</p><p>- No real friendships after school/colleges. This is a huge deal once you are out on your own in the real world. Work relationships are meh at best and with remote work nowadays, it has become even worse.</p><p>- Even if you join a club or activity, they are too "planned" and "robotic". For example, my kids take a dance class and they said they don't like it. I realized why. There is no break. They don't even get to spend like 30 mins with other kids socializing etc. There is a fixed schedule. You go, you dance, you leave.</p><p>But this is the world today.

Figure out your hobbies, or find one if you don't have any.</p><p>My answer to what a lot of people call "the male loneliness epidemic" as a woman is to say it doesn't exist, you need to figure out how to be attractive. We aren't throwing ourselves on shitty men, and most of the men that complain are complaining because they feel entitled to us and thus put no effort into being attractive. The quickest way to be attractive is have empathy and not be a douche.

<div><p>I think the big solution consists of many small solutions. One problem I identified is that social media platforms (1) decimated local live music events coverage in mid-sized cities and (2) placed live music events into the same "filter bubble" algorithm as everything else, making it difficult for people to discover what is going on nearby.</p><p>I started <a href="https://musiclocal.org/" rel="nofollow">https://musiclocal.org</a>, a 501(c)(3), as a curated live music events platform for my local area (and hopefully others). We list all the live music events in the area, and we optimize the software for usability, performance, SEO, etc. The goal is to make discovering local live music events as easy as doom-scrolling. We have had an outstanding reception in the area we serve. We are not self-sustaining yet, but I am optimistic about our chances. As a non-profit, we do not do any of the dark-pattern garbage that has become omnipresent in social media and other consumer software. We just do the right thing as best we can.</p><p>Here is some more background (from our "Issues" page):</p><p>At MusicLocal, we focus on the root challenges facing local music communities to address endemic issues of negative social media practices, isolation and community polarization, and economic concentration and monopolization. Specifically:</p><p>• We believe convenient, comprehensive live music event listings are critical to reversing the decline in local music journalism.
• We believe ethically designed, steward-curated live music event listings provide a vital alternative to addictive social media platforms.
• We believe that making live music more visible and accessible encourages in-person interaction, strengthening communities and alleviating loneliness and social isolation.
• We believe that local live music listings are a critical component of strong local economies, helping to lessen the negative economic consequences of big tech and music industry monopolies.</p><p>---</p><p>"Technology has a purpose, and that purpose is to do good and to share" --Steve Wozniak</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46637034"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637034" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637034&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>Well, let's start by confronting and acknowledging the very strong case that we -- "we" here being the tech world in general, and the audience of this site -- bear a heavy burden of responsibility for it.</p><p>It could be argued that it was all inevitable given the development of the Internet: development of social media, the movement online of commerce and other activities that used to heavily involve "incidental" socialization, etc. And maybe it was. But "we" are still the ones who built it. So are "we" really the right ones to solve it, through the same old silicon valley playbook?</p><p>The usual thought process of trying to push local "community groups," hobby-based organizations etc is not bad, but I think it misses an important piece of the puzzle, which is that we've started a kind of death spiral, a positive feedback loop suppressing IRL interaction. People started to move online because it was easier, and more immediate than "IRL." But as more people, and a greater fraction of our social interaction moves online, "IRL" in turn becomes even more featureless. There are fewer community groups, fewer friends at the bar or the movies, fewer people open to spontaneous interaction. This, then, drives <i>even more</i> of culture online.</p><p>What use is trying to get "back out into the real world," when everyone else has left it too, while you were gone?</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46637626"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637626" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637626&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>CTRL+F "third place" -- take my upvote.</p><p>Anyone suffering in the loneliness epidemic should have a copy of <i>The Great Good Place</i>, by Ray Oldenburg. The entire point is that you should be putting yourself into socially active areas in your community.</p><p>This includes: a church, a local pub or coffee shop <i>with regulars</i> (ideally walking distance from where you live), a rec sports/game league or club.</p><p>Knowing this, I've perused it in my life and it seems very effective. I'm a regular at a Trivia Night one night per week (I don't go every week, but enough to know both the bartender and host by name). I'm a regular at a bar three blocks away from where I live, even if I consume only one non-alcoholic beverage and one alcoholic beverage per visit (a couple night a week), that leaves me plenty of time to chat with my neighbors. I'm a member of a local golf club (a very cheap municipal course), and play there every other week, and after a couple years have very good relationships with many of the other members even if we don't interact much outside of the club. At my last apartment, I was a regular at the coffee shop enough to know multiple baristas by name, it wasn't exactly a third place situation, but it was getting close before I moved. I'm not religious, but I'm very familiar with academic institutions and open lecture series that I used tot attend in grad school.</p><p>I do this intentionally. My partner had never been a regular at a bar before, and she really, really enjoys it now even though she doesn't really drink. When she joins me, she will <i>maybe</i> consume one-half of a light beer. You don't have to be an alcoholic to be a regular, this is a major point that Oldenburg discusses when he contrasts German-style drinking culture with English-style drinking culture.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Good_Place_(book)" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Good_Place_(book)</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46637489"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637489" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637489&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>it seems like a lot of locales that would have been third places in the past have been neutered because the people go there and then immediately put up walls. coffeeshops have become ad-hoc offices where people will sit there with a laptop and give off "leave me alone, i'm working".</p><p>people need to find a way to sit in a third space without pulling up a screen or a book that immediately re-isolates you.</p><p>also: don't underestimate the subtle effect of architecture and seating arrangements here. a coffee shop is filled with lots of little two-seat tables that intentionally isolate. for contrast, think about local pubs/bars -- there's one big central seating arrangement where evertybody is facing the bartender. the bartender is naturally placed in a position that makes them serve as a conversational mediator that can facilitate connections between then people hanging out on the periphery.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46638338"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46638338" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46638338&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>on the topic of platonic friendship, I couldn’t disagree more with a lot of the comments. I have plenty of friends yet I don’t do clubs and will never, <i>ever</i> do organized religion. People advising it are religious freaks in my opinion. Some of my best friends took this advice to go to church and bible study. They complain every time I see them about the people in their church. Meanwhile I’ve made more and better friends online. Its not hard, get on social media, find an influencer/streamer that matches your vibes and go jump into the official or adjacent discord community and play video games with people in that community. If you engage in active listening and are a decent person, you will easily make plenty of friends. Additionally, I think in person hangouts are kinda mid, but I hangout with my friends in-person (at a minimum) every other day when I weight lift. Like seriously, I <i>often</i> would rather chill in Discord than go and hang out in-person.</p><p>To me the male loneliness epidemic is more about a lack of ability to find meaningful romantic relationships. I’ve been thinking about this a lot, and as somebody who has been doing online dating since it essentially started, I am pretty sure that the problem (or at least a major piece) is that match group has commodified romantic relationships.</p><p>I know a lot of people will focus on meeting people in public or whatever, but it has been my experience that dating has become completely garbage and a large part is because all of the current popular dating apps disallow index search and funnel you into swiping. From a mate selection perspective this makes no sense. Not only does it muddy the waters about who is actually a real match, but it also does psychic damage to make so many shallow judgements.</p><p>Back before match group bought OkCupid, I used to have <i>excellent</i> results finding people their who shared a lot of common ground with, messaging them with a thoughtful message, and going on dates. Swiping is an absolute crap shoot, and often I feel like I am being used.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46635857"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46635857" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46635857&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

(Maybe even some that <i>don't</i> wrestle with loneliness.)</p><p>But what's you're next step?  Someone comes up and marks that they feel really lonely.  Do you get contact information?  Invite them to something?  (Invite them to what?  You may have to create something - a board game night at your house, or a "lonely people shopping together" time at a grocery store, or <i>something</i>.  You probably have to create that "something", because you're the one who's able to at least reach out, and the ones who are responding probably aren't there yet.)</p><p>You're finding people that need something.

<div><p>I think part of the problem is that social media is normalized and it is easy. It is way easier to engage socially (or at least you feel like you're engaging socially) with likes and lurking and stuff. It is way harder to put on pants and go out and it is normalized to do so (phrasing like bedrotting is super casual, whereas it is actually really hard to maintain an eating disorder because you have to be constantly hiding it from people).</p><p>Also I think there's more groups whose social norms online teach you to be repulsive offline and again there's not enough social pushback against it. We do need to be harder on casual edginess online because it is teaching habitual behaviors that make it hard to engage socially. Your 50 year old hiking buddy is not going to understand your soycuck joke you are trying to show him on your phone. Your average wine mom at women-only book club is not going to love if you insist on talking about banning trans people from the club because they're "men invading the women's spaces" especially when there's very likely 0 trans people to exclude in the first place on account of trans people being rare.</p><p>Lastly there is usually a ton of stuff happening but the instructions on how to engage with it is nebulous. People who know the algorithm find it easy, the people who don't know the algorithm find it super hard. And IDK how to solve that because there's so much going on in people's heads that they don't realize the people around them seriously aren't scrutinizing them that much. There's like a socialization death spiral where every small awkward interaction hurts way more when you don't have enough experience to know that the small awkward interactions are normal. So you can't tell someone "just go to book club" because they'll go, have 1 normal situation like mishearing someone and then decide they are so embarrassed they can never go to book club again-- but since it is so normal it happens at every social event and they end up lonely.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46637257"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637257" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637257&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>You actually bring up the biggest obstacle to my tentative idea for this Sunday, of holding up a sign that points to a time/place for a casual conversation with strangers. I thought this would be a good way to get very lonely passers-by out of their comfort zone and into a situation where they have a chance to make friends and bond, but the absolute diversity of interests is the main show stopper. My first thought was to essentially avoid sensitive topics on the poster, such as religion and politics, but it still leaves the huge diversity of potential common interests open. So I started doing some research on the most common hobbies that people have in cities and that can be talked about casually, in hopes of finding like 5 ot 6 to write on the sign to get people into the coffee shop.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46638216"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46638216" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46638216&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>Loneliness epidemic started 30+ years ago. There were books written in the 90s about it(bowling alone). Nothing modern can be blamed on it. If anything, social media is helping the crisis; not causing.</p><p>The 'fixes' has been established for just as long. My nearby 'community centre' was built in 1987. Has this been successful at all? Not in the least bit.</p><p>The reality of what is causing this hasnt changed. Without fixing this key problem, the crisis obviously has continued for 30+ years. I'm not nostradamus here. However, from many previous conversations it's crazy how absolutely nobody is ready to talk about the cause. They'd rather just call it a paradox or feign ignorance for why this is happening. Honestly it's rather conspiratorial creating when you think about it.</p><p>Out of curiousity I asked what gemini 3 pro thinks.</p><p>1. Revival of third places.</p><p>As if that hasnt been tried for 30+ years... fail.</p><p>2. replacing 'socializing' with "service"</p><p>The idea is that cleaning a park will somehow make you less lonely is laughable at best.</p><p>3. Bridging the generational gap.</p><p>Elderly teach the young skills? while youth teach digital literacy. My community centre literally has this. F mark.</p><p>4. Urban design and walkability.</p><p>We need to spend trillions of dollars to completely redesign and rebuild cities? lol what.</p><p>5. digital hygiene</p><p>social media is a sedative? crazy.</p><p>I love gemini, but man they are getting it so wrong. All of this will likely just caused the crisis to be worse in my opinion.</p><p>To me, has this been done unintentionally through the typical 'road to hell is paved with good intentions' or has this been intentionally done and maintained? The refusal to acknowledge the cause seems to push toward intentional. Guess we just live with the loneliness epidemic.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46638306"><td></td></tr><tr id="46637967"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637967" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637967&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>You can't.</p><p>It is up to them to change. They won't change, and this "loneliness epidemic" is starting to become really fucking annoying. It is almost a grift now to shit on tech by mids.</p><p>These people don't want to go outside or engage with other people.</p><p>It is like people who are drug/alcohol/tobacco/gambling/sex/etc addicts. It is up to the individual to change. How is it anyone else's responsibility?</p><p>I surveyed a bunch of people on reddit, discords, etc. a couple years ago to figure out why people are lonely, back when this whole "loneliness" movement was starting.</p><p>A lot of these people say they have "trauma" or some other mental block as a primary reason why they're lonely (btw they're in discords with thousands of people, and playing online games with OTHER PEOPLE). I'm sorry but everyone has shit going on in their lives. You aren't really that special.</p><p>Maybe 1-5% of people have dealt with actual, really horrific trauma, and even they have managed to go on to have fulfilling lives. They chose to move on.</p><p>I'm an asshole, no doubt, and I've dealt with my own traumas in the past that were honestly way more fucking horrible than "I'm shy" or "nobody likes [insert some esoteric niche]" and guess what? Who cares? Go outside.</p><p>There is no helping these people, or anyone to be honest, unless they really want to make a change. These aren't starving Sudanese or people who live in India or something where you can't just "go outside". Mfs be in CALIFORNIA and crying. I'd understand if they were lonely because they were living in Iraq or Venezuela or something.</p><p>The only solution is we build a Matrix, and put all these people into it. I will bet 100% of my net worth and any earnings from my entire lineage for perpetuity that they will still fucking complain and be lonely. I was really hopeful for metaverse, too bad but maybe there's still a chance.</p><p>I never want to hear about "loneliness epidemic" again, to me it just sounds like DEI/ESG/Eacc and other bs grifting now to hate on tech. Everything is a choice. You press A in a video game even though you're lonely, why not press A to go outside?</p><p>These people aren't lonely, they exist in massive online echo chambers with other people. And honestly? I think they like it. Most drug addicts loved being on drugs even though it was a horrific existence. They don't like it when they're narcan'd during OD. But when they decide to get clean, I am proud that they actually did it how amazing is that?

<div><p>from what I've looked into, on an individual level, the main thing I need to do is learn how to be a good company for others. Be for other strangers what I would want them to be for me. But it's easier said then done.</p><p>From a practical perspective, there is the whole "3rd place" issue. How can I open a business that caters to the public, who will just sit there and loiter on their phones and laptops all day and be profitable. Starbucks sort of did it in the 90s, but they're not tolerating that anymore.</p><p>Forget businesses, can you walk to a park, a beach, a hiking trail on a whim and run into people? Can you hold events, watch parties,etc.. on public places easily like that? It's not easy at all these days.</p><p>I blame cars. I despise the idea that electric cars are the replacement to cars, without considering changing transportation so that it is more efficient with trams, trains,etc... The side-effect of that is you run into strangers on public transport. This doesn't just affect the loneliness epidemic, it is in my opinion a direct cause of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and of course obesity. You can't even be homeless and sleep on the streets these days. Even the park benches are built to be hostile to anyone that wants to chill there for too long.</p><p>Society was restructured between 1950s-1980s so that it is suburbanized. It's all about the family unit, single family homes, freeways and roads built to facilitate single family homes (after WW2, starting families was all the rage, plus white-flight didn't help). Shopping centers built to cater to consumers driving from their suburban homes. Malls you can walk in, after you drove some time to park there. Even when you buy food items at grocery stores, pay attention to serving sizes, it is improving a little, but you'll see at minimum a serving size of two typically.</p><p>Society was deliberately engineered so that you have more reasons to spend more as a consumer. Families spend more per-capita. suburbs mean more houses purchased, entire generations renting with their bank as a landlord via mortgages, home repair, home insurance, car insurance, car repairs, gas stations for cars where you can get the most unhealthy things out there in the most frequented and convenient places. Make kids, make wives, make ex-wives, get sick the whole lot of you for hospitals, health insurances,etc..</p><p>It wasn't planned by some central committees or secret cabal, but it was planned nonetheless by economists and policy makers.</p><p>If everyone just got married and had kids, they won't be lonely would they? you don't need to hang out at park with strangers, you'll feel less of a member of your local neighborhood who look and think like you, and start thinking more as one people.</p><p>All the interpersonal interactions and opportunities to build relationships with people are commercialized and controlled.</p><p>For one reason or another, people are just not getting married in their early 20's anymore, or having that many kids later on like before. Even when you get married, your interaction is by design with other married people, who are busy commuting in their cars to and fro work, kids school,kids sports, plays,etc... imagine taking your kids on busses and trains every day to these places which are fairly near-by, by necessity. you'll be spending time with them instead of operating machinery. They'll be meeting stranger kids from other schools, seeing random strangers all the time, you'll be talking to randos as you walk to the train, wait on the bus,etc.. but this can't be monetized.</p><p>Blame the economists and policy makers if you want to blame someone.</p><p>If you want solutions, let's talk explicitly about the policy changes that need to happen.</p><p>Too much traffic? tear down the freeways instead of building more lanes.</p><p>It costs $10B to build a simple metro line? pass better laws to regulate bidding and costs, investigate fraud and waste.</p><p>But to dig even deeper into the root of the matter, look at what is celebrated and prized in society. Most of its ills come from there. For most Americans, it is inconceivable to be able to just go out of your house without any plans or destination in mind and just start walking and see where you end up, and who you run into. That's a crucial and tragic ability that's been lost. We really have more urgent things to address to be fair, but ultimately, this can only be solved one small step at a time, but also big sweeping changes are needed. The first step is to define and accept what the problem is, and where the blame and cause lie.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46637163"><td></td></tr><tr id="46637808"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46637808" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46637808&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46635345"></a></center></td><td><br>

          <p>We’re Fly.io, and this is the place in the post where we’d normally tell you that our job is to <a href="https://fly.io/blog/docker-without-docker/" title="">take your containers and run them on our own hardware</a> all around the world. But last week, we <a href="https://sprites.dev/" title="">launched Sprites</a>, and they don’t work that way at all. Sprites are something new: Docker without Docker without Docker. This post is about how they work.</p>
<p>Replacement-level homeowners buy boxes of pens and stick them in “the pen drawer”. What the elites know: you have to think adversarially about pens. “The purpose of a system is what it does”; a household’s is to uniformly distribute pens.  Months from now, the drawer will be empty, no matter how many pens you stockpile. Instead, scatter pens every place you could possibly think to look for one — drawers, ledges, desks. Any time anybody needs a pen, several are at hand, in exactly the first place they look.</p>

<p>This is the best way I’ve found to articulate the idea of <a href="https://sprites.dev/" title="">Sprites</a>, the platform we just launched at Fly.io. Sprites are ball-point disposable computers. Whatever mark you mean to make, we’ve rigged it so you’re never more than a second or two away from having a Sprite to do it with.</p>

<p>Sprites are Linux virtual machines. You get root. They <code>create</code> in just a second or two: so fast, the experience of creating and shelling into one is identical to SSH'ing into a machine that already exists. Sprites all have a 100GB durable root filesystem. They put themselves to sleep automatically when inactive, and cost practically nothing while asleep.</p>

<p>As a result, I barely feel the need to name my Sprites. Sometimes I’ll just type <code>sprite create dkjsdjk</code> and start some task. People at Fly.io who use Sprites have dozens hanging around.</p>

<p>There aren’t yet many things in cloud computing that have the exact shape Sprites do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Instant creation
</li><li>No time limits
</li><li>Persistent disk
</li><li>Auto-sleep to a cheap inactive state
</li></ul>

<p>This is a post about how we managed to get this working. We created a new orchestration stack that undoes some of the core decisions we made for <a href="https://fly.io/machines" title="">Fly Machines</a>, our flagship product. Turns out, these new decisions make Sprites drastically easier for us to scale and manage. We’re pretty psyched.</p>

<p>Lucky for me, there happen to be three <code>big decisions</code> we made that get you 90% of the way from Fly Machines to Sprites, which makes this an easy post to write. So, without further ado:</p>
<h2 id="decision-1-no-more-container-images"><a href="#decision-1-no-more-container-images" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Decision #1: No More Container Images</span></h2>
<p>This is the easiest decision to explain.</p>

<p>Fly Machines are approximately <a href="https://fly.io/blog/docker-without-docker/" title="">OCI containers repackaged as KVM micro-VMs</a>. They have the ergonomics of Docker but the isolation and security of an EC2 instance. We love them very much and they’re clearly the wrong basis for a ball-point disposable cloud computer.</p>

<p>The “one weird trick” of Fly Machines is that they <code>start</code> and <code>stop</code> instantly, fast enough that they can wake in time to handle an incoming HTTP request. But they can only do that if you’ve already <code>created</code> them. You have to preallocate. <code>Creating</code> a Fly Machine can take over a minute. What you’re supposed to do is to create a whole bunch of them and <code>stop</code> them so they’re ready when you need them. But for Sprites, we need <code>create</code> to be so fast it feels like they’re already there waiting for you.</p>
<p>We only murdered user containers because we wanted them dead.</p>
<p>Most of what’s slow about <code>creating</code> a Fly Machine is containers. I say this with affection: your containers are crazier than a soup sandwich. Huge and fussy, they take forever to <a href="https://fly.io/blog/docker-without-docker/" title="">pull and unpack</a>. The regional locality sucks;  <code>create</code> a Fly Machine in São Paulo on <code>gru-3838</code>, and a <code>create</code> on  <code>gru-d795</code> is no faster. A <a href="https://community.fly.io/t/global-registry-now-in-production/13723" title="">truly heartbreaking</a> amount of <a href="https://community.fly.io/t/faster-more-reliable-remote-image-builds-deploys/25841" title="">engineering work</a> has gone into just allowing our OCI registry to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jD-Rt4_CR8" title="">keep up</a> with this system. </p>

<p>It’s a tough job, is all I’m saying. Sprites get rid of the user-facing container. Literally: problem solved. Sprites get to do this on easy mode.</p>

<p>Now, today, under the hood, Sprites are still Fly Machines. But they all run from a standard container. Every physical worker knows exactly what container the next Sprite is going to start with, so it’s easy for us to keep pools of “empty” Sprites standing by. The result: a Sprite <code>create</code> doesn’t have any heavy lifting to do; it’s basically just doing the stuff we do when we <code>start</code> a Fly Machine.</p>

<h2 id="decision-2-object-storage-for-disks"><a href="#decision-2-object-storage-for-disks" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Decision #2: Object Storage For Disks</span></h2>
<p>Every Sprite comes with 100GB of durable storage. We’re able to do that because the root of storage is S3-compatible object storage.</p>

<p>You can arrange for 100GB of storage for a Fly Machine. Or 200, or 500. The catch:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have to ask (with <code>flyctl</code>); we can’t reasonably default it in.
</li><li>That storage is NVMe attached to the physical server your Fly Machine is on. 
</li></ul>
<p>[†] we print a <span>big red warning</span> about this if you try to make a single-node cluster</p>
<p>We designed the storage stack for Fly Machines for Postgres clusters. A multi-replica Postgres cluster gets good mileage out of Fly Volumes. Attached storage is fast, but can <span>lose data†</span> — if a physical blows up, there’s no magic what rescues its stored bits. You’re stuck with our last snapshot backup. That’s fine for a replicated Postgres! It’s part of what Postgres replication is for. But for anything without explicit replication, it’s a very sharp edge.</p>

<p>Worse, from our perspective, is that attached storage anchors workloads to specific physicals. We have lots of reasons to want to move Fly Machines around. Before we  did Fly Volumes, that was as simple as pushing a “drain” button on a server. Imagine losing a capability like that. It took 3 years to <a href="https://fly.io/blog/machine-migrations/" title="">get workload migration right</a> with attached storage, and it’s still not “easy”.</p>
<p>Object stores are the Internet’s Hoover Dams, the closest things we have to infrastructure megaprojects.</p>
<p>Sprites jettison this model. We still exploit NVMe, but not as the root of storage. Instead, it’s a read-through cache for a blob on object storage. S3-compatible object stores are the most trustworthy storage technology we have. I can feel my blood pressure dropping just typing the words “Sprites are backed by object storage.”</p>

<p>The implications of this for orchestration are profound. In a real sense, the durable state of a Sprite is simply a URL. Wherever he lays his hat is his home! They migrate (or recover from failed physicals) trivially. It’s early days for our internal tooling, but we have so many new degrees of freedom to work with.</p>

<p>I could easily do another 1500-2000 words here on the Cronenberg film Kurt came up with for the actual storage stack, but because it’s in flux, let’s keep it simple.</p>

<p>The Sprite storage stack is organized around the JuiceFS model (in fact, we currently use a very hacked-up JuiceFS, with a rewritten SQLite metadata backend). It works by splitting storage into data (“chunks”) and metadata (a map of where the “chunks” are). Data chunks live on object stores; metadata lives in fast local storage.  In our case, that metadata store is <a href="https://litestream.io/" title="">kept durable with Litestream</a>. Nothing depends on local storage.</p>
<p>(our pre-installed Claude Code will checkpoint aggressively for you without asking)</p>
<p>This also buys Sprites fast <code>checkpoint</code> and <code>restore</code>. Checkpoints are so fast we want you to use them as a basic feature of the system and not as an escape hatch when things go wrong; like a git restore, not a system restore. That works because both <code>checkpoint</code> and <code>restore</code> merely shuffle metadata around.</p>

<p>Our stack sports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dm-cache" title="">a dm-cache-like</a> feature that takes advantage of attached storage. A Sprite has a sparse 100GB NVMe volume attached to it, which the stack uses to cache chunks to eliminate read amplification. Importantly (I can feel my resting heart rate lowering) nothing in that NVMe volume should matter; stored chunks are immutable and their true state lives on the object store.</p>
<p>Our preference for object storage goes further than the Sprite storage stack. The global orchestrator for Sprites is an Elixir/Phoenix app that uses object storage as the primary source of metadata for accounts. We then give each account an independent SQLite database, again made durable on object storage with Litestream.</p><h2 id="decision-3-inside-out-orchestration"><a href="#decision-3-inside-out-orchestration" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Decision #3: Inside-Out Orchestration</span></h2>
<p>In the cloud hosting industry, user applications are managed by two separate, yet equally important components: the host, which orchestrates workloads, and the guest, which runs them. Sprites flip that on its head: the most important orchestration and management work happens inside the VM.</p>

<p>Here’s the trick: user code running on a Sprite isn’t running in the root namespace. We’ve slid a container between you and the kernel. You see an inner environment, managed by a fleet of services running in the root namespace of the VM.</p>
<p>I wish we’d done Fly Machines this way to begin with. I’m not sure there’s a downside. The inner container allows us to bounce a Sprite without rebooting the whole VM, even on checkpoint restores. I think Fly Machines users could get some mileage out of that feature, too.</p>
<p>With Sprites, we’re pushing this idea as far as we can. The root environment hosts the majority of our orchestration code. When you talk to the global API, chances are you’re talking directly to your own VM. Furthermore:</p>

<ul>
<li>Our storage stack, which handles checkpoint/restore and persistence to object storage, lives there;
</li><li>so does the service manager we expose to Sprites, which registers user code that needs to restart when a Sprite bounces;
</li><li>same with logs;
</li><li>if you bind a socket to <code>*:8080</code>, we’ll make it available outside the Sprite — yep, that’s in the root namespace too.
</li></ul>

<p>Platform developers at Fly.io know how much easier it can be to hack on <code>init</code> (inside the container) than things <a href="https://fly.io/blog/carving-the-scheduler-out-of-our-orchestrator/" title="">like <code>flyd</code></a>, the Fly Machines orchestrator that runs on  the host. Changes to Sprites don’t restart host components or muck with global state. The blast radius is just new VMs that pick up the change. We sleep on how much platform work doesn’t get done not because the code is hard to write, but because it’s so time-consuming to ensure benign-looking changes don’t throw the whole fleet into metastable failure. We had that in mind when we did Sprites.</p>
<h2 id="we-keep-the-parts-that-worked"><a href="#we-keep-the-parts-that-worked" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>We Keep The Parts That Worked</span></h2>
<p>Sprites running on Fly.io take advantage of the infrastructure we already have. For instance: Sprites might be the fastest thing there currently exists to get Claude or Gemini to build a full-stack application on the Internet.</p>

<p>That’s because Sprites plug directly into <a href="https://fly.io/blog/corrosion/" title="">Corrosion, our gossip-based service discovery system</a>. When you ask the Sprite API to make a public URL for your Sprite, we generate a Corrosion update that propagates across our fleet instantly. Your application is then served, with an HTTPS URL, from our proxy edges.</p>

<p>Sprites live alongside Fly Machines in our architecture. They include some changes  that are pure wins, but they’re mostly tradeoffs:</p>

<ul>
<li>We’ve always wanted to run Fly Machine disks off object storage (<a href="https://community.fly.io/t/bottomless-s3-backed-volumes/15648" title="">we have an obscure LSVD feature that does this</a>), but the performance isn’t adequate for a hot Postgres node in production.
</li><li>For that matter, professional production apps ship out of CI/CD systems as OCI containers; that’s a big part of what makes orchestrating Fly Machines so hard.
</li><li>Most (though not all) Sprite usage is interactive, and Sprite users benefit from their VMs aggressively sleeping themselves to keep costs low; e-commerce apps measure responsiveness in milliseconds and want their workloads kept warm.
</li></ul>

<p>Sprites are optimized for a different kind of computing than Fly Machines, and <a href="https://fly.io/blog/code-and-let-live/" title="">while Kurt believes that the future belongs to malleable, personalized apps</a>, I’m not so sure. To me, it makes sense to prototype and acceptance-test an application on Sprites. Then, when you’re happy with it, containerize it and ship it as a Fly Machine to scale it out. An automated workflow for that will happen.</p>

<p>Finally, Sprites are a contract with user code: an API and a set of expectations about how the execution environment works. Today, they run on top of Fly Machines. But they don’t have to. Jerome’s working on an open-source local Sprite runtime. We’ll find other places to run them, too.</p>
<h2 id="you-wont-get-it-until-you-use-them"><a href="#you-wont-get-it-until-you-use-them" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>You Won’t Get It Until You Use Them</span></h2>
<p>I can’t not sound like a shill. Sprites are the one thing we’ve shipped that I personally experience as addictive. I haven’t fully put my finger on why it feels so much easier to kick off projects now that I can snap my finger and get a whole new computer. The whole point is that there’s no reason to parcel them out, or decide which code should run where. You just make a new one.</p>

<p>So to make this fully click, I think you should <a href="https://sprites.dev/" title="">just install the <code>sprite</code> command</a>, make a Sprite, and then run an agent in it. We’ve preinstalled Claude, Gemini, and Codex, and taught them how to do things like checkpoint/restore, registering services, and getting logs. Claude will run in <code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code> mode (because why wouldn’t it). Have it build something; I built a “Chicago’s best sandwich” bracket app for a Slack channel.</p>

<p>Sprites bill only for what you actually use (in particular: only for storage blocks you actually write, not the full 100GB capacity). It’s reasonable to create a bunch. They’re ball-point disposable computers. After you get a feel for them, it’ll start to feel weird not having them handy.</p>

First, while smartphone processors are the largest portion of chips bought by Apple, they’re not the only type. Processors for Macs come under HPC, while it also has a strong lineup of custom chips used in accessories which fall under digital consumer electronics. Second, Nvidia isn’t the only HPC client. AMD is a major buyer of capacity for its own GPUs while Amazon and Google are on the growing list of customers developing in-house AI chips.</p><p>Put another way, Apple’s chip catalog is broader and more varied, while Nvidia’s lineup is more concentrated around a huge number of wafers at, or near, leading-edge. It’s for these reasons that Apple will remain important for at least another decade.</p><p>In the near-term, however, TSMC’s technology roadmap coupled with broader industry trends favor Nvidia, AMD and their ilk, meaning Apple may need to keep fighting for capacity over the next year or two. </p><p>TSMC is already producing chips in volume at 2 nanometer (called N2), currently its most advanced node, with Apple a major buyer. But in the second half of this year it’s set to ramp up both a new variant called N2P as well as a new node called A16. </p><p><span>The company’s business model is a little quirky. Instead of repurposing an existing factory for new technology, TSMC just builds a new one. This ensures no interruption to output and allows it to squeeze the most out of old tools and processes. In general, this means any new capacity that TSMC builds is for a new node. As a result, it has numerous fabs still churning out chips on technology that’s a decade older or more.</span><span data-state="closed"><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-184494017" href="https://www.culpium.com/p/exclusiveapple-is-fighting-for-tsmc#footnote-3-184494017" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png" width="1456" height="683" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/349cdf18-9651-4c1f-9d5e-569352323bf2_1920x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:683,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:531378,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.culpium.com/i/184494017?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F349cdf18-9651-4c1f-9d5e-569352323bf2_1920x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHPp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07f25979-e964-495a-9a65-7d1790aabd2e_1920x900.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>In TSMC CEO CC Wei’s words A16, with Super Power Rail, is “best for HPC with complex signal routes.” SPR is TSMC’s version of backside power, a newer approach designed to separate a chip’s signal from its power supply. Intel is also developing this technology, and many believe it’ll be the key to the US company’s prospects at stealing foundry share from its Taiwan rival.</p><p><span>After that, TSMC has A14 which it expects to bring into volume production around 2028. Some call this the next full node after N2, labeling A16 as not a “full node.” In truth, all of these names are as much marketing terms as they are technology designators. Nevertheless, as SemiAnalysis recently wrote in </span><a href="https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/apple-tsmc-the-partnership-that-built" rel="">a fabulous report on the TSMC-Apple relationship,</a><span> the balance will shift back to Apple because A14 is designed “for both mobile and HPC from the start.”</span></p><p>More importantly, what Apple offers is stability. Nvidia has been a client for a lot longer than Apple, but broadly speaking it’s a bit niche. Right now that “niche” is the hottest product on the planet, but niche it is. Apple, on the other hand, has products being made in no fewer than a dozen TSMC fabs. Even if Nvidia did overtake Apple by purchases, the breadth of its manufacturing footprint at TSMC is nowhere near as large.</p><p>This distinction may not matter now, but it probably will at some point.

Capital intensity was just 2.5% for 2024, while depreciation was only 5.7% of the cost of revenue. As a fabless chipmaker, it can enjoy gross margins of over 70%. Its only real risk is holding excess inventory. Even then, it could have written off its entire inventory at the end of October and still maintain a gross margin approaching that of its chief supplier. What’s more, neither of these clients have anywhere near the customer-concentration risk of TSMC.</p><p>The complaint that TSMC could and should build faster ignores the fact that it’s the one left holding the baby if a downturn comes and demand falls. It takes two to three years to build a new fab, Wei explained, so the company must skate where the puck is going without thinking too much about where it’s been. “Even if we spend 52 to 56 billion this year, the contribution this year is none,“ Wei said Thursday. Its major cost, buying equipment, remains on the books no matter what revenue it brings in for the quarter. </p><p>For the best part of a decade, Apple was the one driving TSMC’s need to keep spending on new facilities. Today it’s Nvidia, and Jensen Huang is starting to wield more power than Tim Cook. But neither has to bother with the expensive business of actually manufacturing semiconductors, merely the hassle of begging CC Wei for wafers.</p><p><span>For such clients, the foundry’s capacity is a fixed cost that they needn’t worry about.

<p>Palantir is working on a tool for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier on each person, and provides a “confidence score” on the person’s current address, 404 Media has learned. ICE is using it to find locations where lots of people it might detain could be based.&nbsp;</p><p>The findings, based on internal ICE material obtained by 404 Media, public procurement records, and recent sworn testimony from an ICE official, show the clearest link yet between the technological infrastructure Palantir is building for ICE and the agency’s activities on the ground. The tool receives peoples’ addresses from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) among a range of other sources, according to the material.</p><div><p>💡</p><p><b><strong>Do you know anything else about this tool? Do you work at ICE, CBP, or Palantir? I would love to hear from you.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/goal-600x447.png" alt="goal" width="300" height="223" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/goal-600x447.png 600w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/goal-300x223.png 300w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/goal-150x112.png 150w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/goal-200x150.png 200w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/goal.png 732w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px">Since 2024, the Paris Judicial Court has expanded the typical piracy site blocking orders beyond Internet providers. </p>
<p>Initially, rightsholders set their aim at DNS resolvers. This resulted in orders targeted at Cloudflare, Google, and others, requiring them to actively block access to pirate sites through their public DNS resolvers.</p>
<p>These blocking expansions were requested by sports rights holders, covering Formula 1, football Ligue 1, MotoGP, and other major sporting brands. They claimed that public DNS resolvers could help users to bypass existing ISP blockades, and the court agreed.</p>
<p>Last year, rightsholders cast their net even wider by targeting VPN providers with similar blocking demands. Again, the Paris Court acknowledged the threat of circumvention, ordering CyberGhost, ExpressVPN, NordVPN, ProtonVPN, and Surfshark to start blocking access to specific websites in France.</p>
<h2>VPN Blocking Expands</h2>
<p>The VPN blocking effort was not a one-off. After the first order was granted in May, more <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/french-court-orders-vpns-to-block-more-pirate-sites-rejects-eu-court-referral/">followed in June and July</a>. These additional orders target various sports piracy sites as requested by the French entertainment powerhouse Canal Plus (SECP) and beIN Sports. </p>
<p>After this initial barrage, the blocking activity seemed to have quieted down, but it is far from over. On December 18, the Paris Judicial Court issued a new blocking order. This time around, the French top football league (LFP) and its commercial arm are the requesting parties. </p>
<p>As in previous orders, ProtonVPN, Nordvpn, Cyberghost, Surfshark and ExpressVPN are the main targets. These VPN providers have to block access to several domains that provide access to pirated sports streams. </p>
<p>The order covers 13 initial domains, including miztv.top, strikeout.im, and prosmarterstv.com. However, it is a ‘dynamic’ order in the sense that, through the overseeing body ARCOM, LFP can add new domains in case additional mirrors and proxies are launched. These blocks remain active for the entire 2025/2026 football season. </p>
<p>The court concludes that these VPNs help people to bypass existing site-blocking measures, rendering ISP blocking ineffective. While the VPN blockades are no silver bullet, combined with other blocking measures they should make it more difficult to access these pirate sites.</p>
<h2>The No-Log Defense</h2>
<p>All VPN providers, except ProtonVPN, appeared in court to argue a defense. They raised various arguments, with the “no-log” defense from Surfshark and NordVPN standing out. </p>
<p>Specifically, the VPNs argued that their “no-log” policy means they do not track user IP addresses or geolocate their users. Therefore, a court order to block access only for French users would violate their contractual obligations. </p>
<p>The court was not very receptive to this argument. Instead, it bluntly concluded that “the contractual stipulations binding VPN service providers to their clients cannot be invoked against [the plaintiffs] who have demonstrated an infringement of their rights.” </p>
<p>The court stressed that blocking the domains does not require the service to permanently store information on its users. The VPNs simply have to make sure that the sites are blocked from France.</p>
<p>In addition, the court rejected the notion that the blocking measures would constitute a “general monitoring obligation”, which is not allowed under the EU’s DSA, because the measures are limited to specific domains and end after the 2025-2026 football season.</p>
<h2>Court Rejects Other Defenses</h2>
<p>The VPNs also argued that their services don’t qualify as “technical intermediaries” under Article L. 333-10 of the Sports Code, but that was denied by the Paris court as well. The same applies to the proportionality and effectiveness arguments, which all failed. </p>
<p>The court’s logic throughout the order is that technical neutrality does not equal legal immunity. </p>
<p>By citing the DSA and the Sports Code, the judge effectively argues that VPN services can be key intermediaries in the piracy ecosystem. Therefore, they are legally obligated to act.</p>
<p>“Contrary to the assertions of Surfshark and NordVPN, the mere act of serving as a bridge to enable access to the pirate sites fulfills the function of transmission. Even if an intermediary acts in a passive, automatic, and neutral manner during the connection between internet domains, it nonetheless remains an essential agent in the transmission of data from one domain to another,” the (translated) order reads.</p>
<h2>What Happens Next?</h2>
<p>The latest ruling confirms that VPN providers can be obligated to block pirate sites, at least in France. However, the final word hasn’t been said. </p>
<p>Speaking with TorrentFreak this week, a NordVPN spokesperson confirms that their appeal is already underway. The company did not directly explain how it complies with the court order but instead said that site-blocking measures are futile. </p>
<p>“While it may address superficial cases, it fails to tackle the root causes of piracy. Pirates can easily circumvent these blocks by using subdomains: blocking does not eliminate the content itself or reduce the incentives for piracy,” <a href="https://nordvpn.com/">NordVPN</a> notes.</p>
<p>“Effective piracy control should focus on eliminating the source of the content, targeting hosting providers, cutting off financing for illegal operations, and increasing the availability of legitimate content.”</p>
<p>In addition, NordVPN notes that, since the French order targets reputable VPNs, users may choose lower-quality free VPNs that will remain a loophole for pirates. </p>
<p>For now, however, the targeted VPN providers have to find a way to implement the blocking order. The court order doesn’t specify any technical measures, so they are free to do as they please, as long as the targeted sites are unavailable. </p>
<p>If the French VPN blockades are ultimately upheld, some providers may choose to leave the country entirely, but none have made this drastic step yet. </p>

In the period ahead, this will result in an increased military presence in and around Greenland, comprising aircraft, vessels and soldiers, including from NATO allies. </p><p>The exercise activities in 2026 could include guarding critical infrastructure, providing assistance to local authorities in Greenland, including the police, receiving allied troops, deploying fighter aircraft in and around Greenland, and conducting naval operations. </p><p>Joint Arctic Command will keep citizens of Greenland continuously informed about the activities and engage in close dialogue with relevant Greenlandic authorities and key stakeholders.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>Background for the initiatives <br></strong>In the summer of 2025, the Danish Armed Forces strengthened their presence and exercise activity in and around Greenland with a number of initiatives and capabilities, including contributions from allies such as Germany, France, Sweden and Norway. The initiatives involved the deployment of capabilities at sea, on land, and in the air, as well as exercises related to protection of Greenland’s critical infrastructure. </p><p>The Government of Greenland, and the Danish Ministry of Defence continue to collaborate closely on the initiatives to ensure local involvement and insight into local conditions. </p><p>Greenland’s Minister for Foreign Affairs and Research Vivan Motzfeldt states: “As part of the NATO alliance, it is a core priority for the Government of Greenland, that defence and security in and around Greenland are strengthened, and that this is achieved in close cooperation with our NATO allies. The Danish Ministry of Defence and the Government of Greenland, are working closely together to launch initiatives and cooperation among both our Arctic and European allies. Once the exercises commence, the Greenlandic people will be kept continuously informed about the activities via Joint Arctic Command’s platforms.” </p><p>Danish Minister for Defence Troels Lund Poulsen states: “Security in the Arctic is of crucial importance to the Kingdom of Denmark and our Arctic allies, and it is therefore important that we, in close cooperation with allies, further strengthen our ability to operate in the region. We did this in 2025, and as a natural extension of these efforts, we will continue and expand the cooperation in 2026. The Danish Armed Forces, together with a number of Arctic and European allies, will explore in the coming weeks how an increased presence and exercise activity in the Arctic can be implemented in practice.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<i>Sean Barrett</i><br>
<i>2011-09-19</i>
<p>
In 1998 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_Glass_Studios">Looking Glass Studios</a>
released the stealth game <i>Thief: The Dark Project</i>. This was just as
3D hardware acceleration was taking off, so due to the development cycle
it didn't use hardware acceleration; it was a purely software-rendered game.
</p><p>
I was the primary author of the core rendering technology in Thief (although I didn't
write the object or character renderers), as well as some related bits and pieces.
The same rendering engine, modified by others to use 3D hardware acceleration, also did
the rendering for System Shock 2 and Thief 2.
</p><p>
The engine was written somewhat contemporaneously
with Quake (despite the game being released much later), and the basic appearance
strongly resembles Quake.
Many of its technologies were copied from or inspired by Quake, but in many cases the way
it works is slightly or significantly different.
</p><p>
The Quake software rendering was thoroughly documented by Michael Abrash in a series
of articles which were reprinted in his <a href="http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/reference/programming/140/283/graphics-programming-black-book-r1698">
Graphics
Programming Black Book</a>. The techniques used in Thief were never written up and
I thought it might be nice to write them down for once, even if they're now totally
irrelevant. I'll try to describe them relative to the probably-more-familiar Quake approaches
where possible.
</p><p>
Important contemporaneous games with similar rendering technology:
</p><ul>
<li>1996-06-22 - Quake 1 (QTest in February 1996)
</li><li>1998-05-22 - Unreal
</li><li>1998-11-19 - Half-Life (derived from the Quake 1 engine)
</li><li>1998-11-30 - Thief: The Dark Project
</li></ul>

<h2><a name="visibility"></a>Visibility</h2>
<p>
Looking Glass games previous to Thief had used grid-based worlds. System Shock 1
and the Ultima Underworlds computed visibility using a grid-based traversal.
Thief, however, was totally
free-form, so I had to start from scratch to design the Thief engine (which
started long before Thief, and I imagine even before we shipped Terra Nova:
Strike Force Centauri, which I worked on).
</p><p>
Thief was based on the portal-and-cell idea for
visibility and occlusion published by Seth Teller in his 1992
PhD dissertation. In fact, the Thief world renderer was called "Portal",
but since that name has a newer popular meaning I'll just call it "Thief"
or "the Thief engine" (but there was far far more to the Thief engine than
just the renderer, such as the object system, AI, physics, and I had nothing
to do with them; I didn't write "the Thief engine", just the renderer).
</p><p>
I was originally exploring this idea as research for an imagined holy grail
for Looking Glass: developing an "indoor-outdoor" CRPG, since the previous
LGS CRPGs (Ultima Underworld 1 &amp; 2, System Shock 1) had all been
"indoor" dungeons, but we also had this outdoor tech for Terra Nova, and
many of us felt we'd want to eventually make a hypothetical Underworld 3 or
something which would have dungeons and exteriors and buildings and what not
(this was before Daggerfall). In trying to imagine how we could put some
kind of a hole
in the Terra Nova terrain to incorporate dungeons, I realized that portals
could be used to seamlessly integrate multiple independent
renderers (like an indoor renderer and an outdoor renderer) by putting portals
at the boundaries, so I wrote up a long document over one Christmas vacation
documenting my thoughts along those lines. Then I guess I had all these ideas
bouncing around in my head, and I knew we didn't
have any idea how to do non-grid stuff, and it seemed viable to just try
to make a full indoor renderer using portals... so I went ahead and tackled
implementing one as research.
</p><p>
The portal-and-cell idea was used offline by Quake for
computing its precomputed PVS ("potentially visible set")--also described
in Seth Teller's dissertation--but Thief used
it at runtime; Thief precomputed the portals and cells, but didn't precompute
any further visibility information. (I believe Descent, which was released
before I even started writing the Thief engine, had already done this,
but I don't know the details.) 
</p><p>
The Thief engine kept a representation of the level in which the open areas
(the areas you could see and/or walk) were divided into convex polyhedra
known as cells. Each cell contained zero or more visible "world polygons"
along the boundaries of the cell that were the visible surfaces of the world. Cells
which adjoined other cells had special boundary polygons called "portals"
which marked the adjacency between the cells. If you could see into a given
cell, then you could see into adjoining cells through the portals to them.
</p><p>
To determine what part of the level was currently visible and needed rendering,
the engine conducted a breadth-first traversal of the portals and cells starting
from the location of the viewpoint. As each portal was traversed, the
cells reached were added to the visible list. Each considered portal
was transformed in 3D, checked if it was back-facing, and if not it
was projected to 2D. Then a "bounding octagon" was generated, which consisted
of a regular 2D bounding box and a 45-degree rotated bounding box.
</p><p>
If a portal led from cell A to cell B, then we compared that portal's
bounding octagon to a bounding octagon of the visiblity of cell A.
If the two didn't overlap, then the portal wasn't actually visible.
If it was visible, then the intersection of cell A's octagon and the
portal's octagon was the part of cell B that was visible through this
portal, so it added that to the list. (It was possible you would see
into cell B through multiple paths, so the engine had to accumulate
all the visible regions, which it did by simply keeping a conservative bounding
octagon of all the incoming path octagons along paths. If you had
two small view paths into one cell, the two at opposite ends of the cell,
the bounding octagon would be much bigger, typically the size of the
whole cell.) The cell containing the viewpoint was always fully visible.
</p><p>
Quake precomputed similar information: for each cell, Quake stored
the list of all other cells that were visible from anywhere in that
cell. This result could be less tight; for example, if you had a long corridor
with many side rooms, and that long corridor was a single cell, then
in Quake it would always try to render all the side rooms, whereas
Thief would only try to render the entry cell to each of the side
rooms (since those cells would always be adjacent to the corridor
and visible), but Thief could cull the rooms themselves if they weren't
currently visible.
</p><p>
Full cell-portal-analysis didn't scale well to higher polygon counts,
so the engine was limping by the time the last game shipped with it
(in other words, it had a lot of overhead when hardware accelerated).
</p><h2><a name="overdraw"></a>Reducing overdraw</h2>
<p>
Quake reduced overdraw by using a span-buffering ("edge list") technique
in which world surfaces were (conceptually) drawn front-to-back and each pixel was
only drawn exactly once.
</p><p>
Thief drew polygons back-to-front, so they did overdraw each other.
Thief's overdraw was already reduced compared to Quake's "naive" (pre-edge-list)
overdraw because of the tighter bounds from traversing the portals dynamically,
as described above.
</p><p>
Thief further reduced overdraw by clipping each rendered world polygon by
the bounding octagon for the visibility of the cell containing that
polygon. (This is part of why bounding octagons were used, as they
significantly reduced overdraw in some cases compared to just using
bounding boxes. In the limit if we had clipped to the exact portals
leading to each cell, this would have resulted in drawing each pixel
only once as well.) I don't have any recollection of what our typical
overdraw was using this approach.
</p><p>
For this to work, Thief had to store world polygons in cells. This
means that world polygons that extended through multiple cells had
to be split; Quake was often able to preserve those as single polygons
since it stored the polygons in a BSP tree directly on split planes.
I'm not sure how much difference this made, though, since both Thief
and Quake also had to split polygons for surface caching.
</p><p>
The 2D clipping to the bounding octagon meant that many Thief
polygons ended up being rendered as 8-sided polygons. This wasn't a problem.
In fact, clipping was straightforward and efficient since it was
purely 2D along simple axes, and there were no S,T (i.e. U,V)
texture coordinates on polygon vertices, since Thief used a technique I'd
previously published
in the PC Game Programmer's Encyclopedia in which the texture coordinates
were defined as a 3D vector basis independent of the vertices, and then
texture coordinates for spans and pixels were computed directly
from the basis vectors.
</p><p>
The skybox was drawn just by tagging polygons with a special texture,
then when drawing it, taking the transformed 2D polygon and clipping
it to each skybox polygon and using the skybox texture mapping for
each of them, or something like that. I don't remember 100%.

</p><h2><a name="culling"></a>Object culling</h2>
As objects were moved around the level, the engine would keep track of
which cells the object was in. It would do this incrementally, using what
cells the object was previously in to guide the current decision. This
meant that this part of the engine could actually handle
arbitrary unrealistic topologies (in which portals could lead to spaces
in inconsistent ways, and fold space back on itself), since the "physics"
could perform these local movement operations, but we never had a way
to <i>make</i> such things, and later a BSP tree was used to
sort the cells, which then required them to be consistently defined;
and the actual Thief game engine never supported it anyway.
(Actually we did have a way to make such things; one thing I did prior
to this engine was write a portal-based Doom-style engine, one that
supported spaces-over-spaces by allowing multiple overlapping
rooms, which could be at different heights (I
believe Dark Forces used a similar technology) or the <i>same</i> height
(since the height didn't actually affect how the Doom-style engine worked). With help from some
coworkers I also had an editor for it, so I was later able to use those
levels in my new fully-3D engine. But we never had a way to make fully 3D levels
that had this property.)
<p>
After discovering all the cells that needed rendering, Thief would
decide which objects needed rendering. Only objects that were in
visible cells might need rendering. However, Thief also computed
a 2D bounding box (or probably octagon) of each potentially visible object
and compared it against the bounding octagon for any cells containing the object.
(Quake had nothing like this since it didn't process portals at runtime.)
</p><p>
Because the Thief engine was better about rejecting invisible cells entirely,
and was able to reject objects that weren't currently visible even if the
cells containing them were, Thief
could generally handle more object-dense worlds than a renderer made
with Quake technology could have. You couldn't necessarily have more <i>visible</i>
objects at once, but you could put more objects in overall as long
as you limited where you could see them from, and so Thief generally
was able to have well-stocked kitchens and dining tables
and sideboards and such.
</p><p>
But this was just dumb luck as I hadn't chosen these algorithms
for that reason in particular, especially as the engine development long
preceded the eventual morphing of the game design into Thief.


</p><h2><a name="sorting"></a>Object sorting</h2>
<p>
Quake rendered objects by generating a z-buffer from the world polygons
(even though the world polygons themselves didn't z-test), and then
testing and updating that z-buffer when rendering objects.
</p><p>
Thief didn't use a z-buffer. Instead, Thief drew the world back-to-front
("painter's algorithm"),
and interleaved rendering of world polygons and objects to make them
appear to occlude each other appropriately.
</p><p>
Many games in the software rendering era (which rarely used z-buffers)
exhibited sorting issues where
objects would become visible through walls or invisible behind walls
they shouldn't be, and portals/cells didn't offer any special guarantees
that would avoid this problem. (For example, Descent exhibited such problems.)
</p><p>
This really bothered me and I worked very hard to fix it. The sorting
algorithm in Thief is the most complicated painter's algorithm sorter I've
every heard of; I remember having to write a little mathematical proof at
one point for one part of it.
</p><p>
I don't remember the details, but I'll try and sketch out some of the
issues and how it probably worked.
</p><p>
Originally the cells were sorted based on the portal-traversal-discovery order, which
provided a topological front-to-back sort order that could be reversed for
back-to-front rendering. However, there were some issues and so by the
time Thief shipped the cells were actually being sorted by a BSP tree. This
meant that the sort order was very far from a breadth-first search; if you
were near the rootmost split plane, the draw order could feature very-close-to-the-viewer
cells drawn <i>before</i> very-far-from-the-viewer cells if the cells and
viewer happened to fall on the appropriate sides of some BSP split plane.
</p><p>
Because of the BSP tree there was no danger that the world polygons would render
in the wrong order, but there was some danger that objects could sort wrong
with respect to each other or the world polygons. To avoid this, the Thief
engine (again, I'm kind of guessing here) conceptually numbered the cells in the order
it would draw them. An object in cell N would normally render immediately
after drawing the (inward-facing) world polygons in cell N and before drawing the walls of cell N+1. However,
sometimes objects would lie in multiple cells. An object in cell M and N,
with M &lt; N, would need to be drawn after all the walls of cell M, but the
parts of it in cell M might be obscured by walls in cell N or indeed in
any of the cells between M and N. (A common case that came up:
a corridor (cell) with a niche (cell) holding a torch, with the torch
slightly protruding into the corridor. The niche is M, and the 
corridor is N--e.g. if the viewpoint is in the corridor, then the
corridor is "closer" to the viewpoint in a back-to-front rendering sense.
For example, one of the walls of the corridor will occlude parts of
the niche.)
</p><p>
To deal with those complexities, Thief would consider whether it was
acceptable to draw a given object in its frontmost cell N (or, indeed,
at any point in the draw order between its rearmost and frontmost).
To do this it would compute bounding octagons on the objects and on
the world polygons and see whether the polygons occluded the objects.
If a world polygon was supposed to be "in front" of an object and the bounding
octagons intersected, then it wasn't safe to move the object later in
the rendering order to a point later than that world polygon.
</p><p>
The Thief engine would resolve what range it was valid to draw each
object in between backmost and frontmost cells containing that object;
if the object was only in one cell it would always be considered as
just being in that cell. Once this was determined, Thief then attempted
to resolve object-vs-object sorting. Because an object might extend
through multiple cells and then be behind or in front of an object
that was in a single cell, objects that were only in one cell might
need to be moved back or moved forward in the sort order anyway; in
other words, the final range of cells that an object might be considered
for rendering after might cover a larger range than just between backmost
and frontmost containing cell.
</p><p>
Thief attempted to use the above ranges to find some sort order for objects, holding the cell
sort order fixed, so that objects and world polygons would all inter-sort
correctly. (This was where that proof came in.) However, sometimes this was impossible. For example, in the
torch-in-the-niche case described above, it's possible for one world
polygon in cell N to be occluded by the torch (the wall with the niche
on it extending behind the niche), but another world polygon in N to occlude
the niche and part of the torch (the wall with the niche on it extend
forward towards the viewer). In this case, there is no sort order of
objects vs. cells that works, because parts of the torch occlude the
cell while parts of the same cell occlude the torch. It would be fixable by
interleaving the world polygons from the cell with the torch, instead
of always drawing all the world polygons from one cell as a unit, but
not all cases could be fixed that way, so Thief actually never did that
(it always drew all world polygons from one cell as a unit) -- unless
I'm remembering wrong.
</p><p>
Instead Thief had an entirely different, extremely expensive mechanism
that it fell back on to solve difficult sorting problems. Each object could be "split" into multiple
pieces, one per cell. In each cell, only the part of the object which
was contained in that cell was rendered. This wasn't done by actually
splitting the object, but rather by rendering it multiple times, once
for each "piece", and for each piece dynamically clipping the object
with a "user clip plane", using similar technology
to the frustum clipping that was also being done. (In complex cases, multiple clip planes would
be needed; however, it was only ever necessary to clip to portals between
the cells the object was in, and not literally clip to all the planes
defining each cell.) If this technique was applied, then that
part of that object could always be drawn in or after that cell. However,
although it didn't increase the per-pixel costs, it required transforming
and clipping the object multiple times, so it was rather expensive. (I
encouraged designers to place their torches fully inside the niches
instead.) This was particularly bad when rendering characters, which
were skinned, since I think the skinning transformations would be performed
multiple times.
</p><p>
This also had another problem: if you had three cells arranged so that the
portals between them formed a T, then the dynamic clipping could create
t-junctions at the border. These would then cause cracks in the rendering.
I don't remember how/if we fixed this.
</p><p>
During development I noticed that if you used all the walls of a cell for
user clip planes--not just the portals--then if an object interpentrated
a wall, it would be clipped away, looking exactly like a z-buffer rendering.
Normally these artifacts arose because the game physics allowed an object
to interpenetrate briefly, so it was actually better not to clip those objects,
and then they wouldn't look (from most angles) like they were going through
the wall. But we could've used an effect like that to allow creatures that
could move through walls even without though we had no z-buffer.
</p><p>
After my positive experience with user clip planes I was frustrated over
the next few years that GPUs didn't efficiently/easily support them. (Even
in D3D9, they're still done in the pixel shader; although you can use z and
stencil to cull more tightly and reduce pixel shading costs.) Of course,
with the z-buffer, it's not clear there are lots of use cases, but there's
a chicken-and-egg problem to that conclusion.
</p><h2><a name="lighting"></a>Light and shadow</h2>
<p>
The core technique for rendering texture mapped polygons with decent
precomputed shadows
is very similar (identical?) to Quake. Thief used light mapping and a surface cache to
store the lit surfaces. I refer you to Mike Abrash's articles.
</p><p>
My recollection is that we added this to the engine after we (the Thief team)
saw the Quake "QTest" release. However, I'm doubtful there really was a Thief
team at that point. According to wikipedia, QTest came out February 24, 1996.
Terra Nova came out on March 5, 1996, so I guess we had built our final
version of Terra Nova by the time QTest was released, but I can't imagine we'd
geared up a whole team yet. In fact I don't know for sure when exactly I did
the original research version of this engine.
</p><p>
At one point objects raycasted to all (or the top N) light sources to determine
if they were visible to it or not and turned the entire light on/off
over the entire object to simulate objects going in-and-out of shadow.
But I don't know if we shipped with this or using the "check the lightmap
value on the floor", which I seem to recall we at least considered using
for the player's visiblity to guards (to avoid players being tricked/confused
by places that appeared to casual inspection to being in shadow).

</p><h2><a name="csg"></a>CSG model</h2>
<p>
Thief levels were created using Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) methods,
based again on knowledge that that was how Quake worked. Technologically
though Thief worked very differently from Quake.
</p><p>
The Thief CSG model was "temporal", which maybe I can better explain by
analogy to Photoshop. In photoshop, you have layers. Stuff placed in one
layer obscures stuff in lower layers, except if you use more interesting
blend modes, in which case stuff in a layer changes the stuff visible
below it but has no affect on things above it.
</p><p>
Algorithmically, you can think of generating the final image by processing
each layer in the image sequentially, from back to front, compositing it
with the "image so far". At the time each image is processed, the image-so-far
contains the accumulated effects of all the earlier (lower) layers, and
then the layer is processed and the image-so-far is changed and that layer
cannot have any further effect except by data it left in the image-so-far.
</p><p>
Normally we think of the photoshop layer model as a stack of 2D layers, 
but you could instead think of the above algorithm <i>as</i> the model, and think
of the layers not as a "vertical" stack but as an ordered sequence of operations
to perform. This is what I mean by a temporal model, and this is the model
that Thief used for its CSG. (If the vertical photoshop layer stack is a vertical
third dimension of the 2D images, then the Thief layering model would be a fourth
dimension on the 3D shapes, and thinking about this as four-dimensional space
is not very effective.)
</p><p>
The Thief CSG took as input a series of "operations" arranged in an order over
time. Those operations were "brush placements", where a brush was a 3D convex
solid plus a characterization of how the area covered by that solid would be changed
by the operation. The entire space started solid, so one brush operation was
"carve out a hole in this area"--in other words "change the area covered by
this brush to open". For example you would use this to carve out a room.
Another placed solid matter; you could use this to create a pillar. Another
placed water, and another lava. Because space could be of 4 types (solid, air,
water, or lava -- oh hey, the 4 classical elements!), each operation could
be considered by which output type it produced. Moreover, we allowed these
operations to be selective. For example, the "flood brush" turned air into
water, but left all other types alone. This made it easier to fill an area
with water--you could construct it entirely with air and then fill the lower
half with water. Because of the temporal aspect, you could <i>then</i> go and
change some of the water to "air" if you needed to. It would have been possible
to make brush types that were much complicated (air turns to water, water turns
to solid, solid turns to air, and lava unchanged) but this wasn't actually
useful so I think all the brush types were of the unconditional-single-type
or conditional-single-type.
</p><p>
As with Photoshop layers, the temporal aspect was something under user control;
you could move a brush forwards or backwards in time. Unfortunately, this was
much harder to visualize (there was no "layers" window) and I'm not sure
designers were really thrilled with this.
</p><p>
In comparison, Quake started with a level that was all open space and placed
solids. It used a more-traditional-CSG explicit-subtraction operation. Water
was handled by making all water brushes occur first temporally, so that all
the effective temporal sequence of operations was: all air =&gt; some air turns
to water =&gt; all solids are placed. Because subtraction was explicit on the
solid brushes before they were added to the world, the subtraction couldn't
"accidentally" erase water, so there was no need for an explicit temporal
model (the set of things you could do in Quake was more limited, but it
supported almost everything that mattered in practice--although some designers
came up with some strange sequences of operations in Thief to create more
complicated shapes).
</p><p>
Because Quake levels started empty, Quake had invisible "exterior" surfaces
that required a separate process to detect and eliminate. If the level wasn't
watertight, then the exterior could be reachable and the automated tools couldn't
eliminate it. In contrast, because the Thief level started solid, this was
never necessary. (I think Unreal's CSG may have started as solid as well.)


</p><h2><a name="csgbsp"></a>CSG implementation</h2>
<p>
I had no idea what I was doing when I implemented the Thief CSG system
(despite having the opportunity to pepper John Carmack with questions) so
I made a terrible choice. The Thief system worked by dividing the world up
into convex polyhedra and keeping track of what each polyhedron's type
i.e. air, solid, water, lava, which I call the "medium". To do this, I
stored the world as a solid BSP tree; the BSP tree classifies all of space into
convex polyhedra (except at the edges where it may have unbounded shapes
extending to infinity).
</p><p>
Using a BSP tree for this had a performance advantage, but I didn't do it
for that reason; I did it because I literally couldn't think of any other
way to compute the output. This way I
was able to sequentially add each
brush to the BSP tree and then apply the medium-transformation-operations
to each BSP leaf that the brush contained.
</p><p>
But reading the Quake source, it turns out you can do it a different way:
intersect every brush with every other brush directly, without a spatial
data strucure. By being careful,
you can build a growing list of convex polyhedra all of which are non-overlapping.
You can then add a spatial data structure to accelerate determining which ones
might overlap, but without affecting the computation itself.
</p><p>
The difference is that the BSP-tree based CSG tree would have situations
where a brush early in the processing would be inserted in the tree early
and would introduce a BSP split plane near the root which then extended
 across the whole level or a significant part of it.
This might randomly come close to an edge or vertex of a totally unrelated
brush, causing an extra split in that brush and introducing additional
epsilon problems. As CSG is already painful numeric geometric algorithms with epsilon
problems, introducing this extra uncontrollable problem was
terrible. The Thief editor was (is?) notorious for having weird problems where
a change to one brush might trigger a failure in the CSG generator
at an entirely unrelated place in the level--a failure which meant
the level simply failed to "compile".
</p><p>
Partway through Thief development I switched everything in the CSG engine from floats
to doubles and cranked down the epsilon, which made things better but didn't
solve the problem properly, but I realize in hindsight it would have been
much, much better to have simply avoided the BSP tree entirely.
</p><p>
The epsilon problems were exacerbated by the crazy way I built the polygons
and portals directly from the BSP-tree in a t-junc free way by computing a
shared mesh along each BSP split plane to guarantee that vertices on one
side of the split plane would always have a matching vertex on the other side;
this introduced a much more complicated set of invariants that had to be maintained
that also had epsilon problems. It meant I didn't have to write a post-processing
t-junction eliminator the way Quake did, but in hindsight that would have been better.

</p><h2><a name="texturing"></a>Perspective texture mapping</h2>
<p>
Looking Glass games prior to Thief such as System Shock 1 and Terra Nova had used
a "lines of constant-Z" mapper to perform perspective texture mapping.
Those games typically used the
perspective texture mapper for large, near polygons, but used an affine
mapper for distant polygons.
</p><p>
Thief used a custom-written perspective mapper for all polygons. It used the trick
used in Quake of issuing a floating-point divide for perspective correction
for every N pixels which then executed in parallel with the texture mapping
of the next N pixels; this worked because the Pentium would execute the
floating-point divide "in the background" if you only used integer instructions
after it (the Pentium was not an out-of-order processor in general).
</p><p>
Thief computed the perspective correction every 8 pixels (that is, N above was 8).
Thief aligned the correction so it occurred on pixels whose x coordinates
were multiples of 8. The beginning and ending of a span of pixels could be
less than 8, and would call a general-purpose N-pixel mapper, but the 8-pixel
spans called a routine that was hardcoded to compute exactly 8 pixels.
</p><p>
Because the engine changed over time and was initially used for research,
it supported two different formats that textures could be stored in. One was
restricted to 256x256 textures, or rather textures with powers-of-two sizes
and in which the stride/pitch was always 256. This used an inner loop similar
to the one I wrote up for the PCGPE. The second one supported arbitrary non-power-of-two textures
but didn't support wrapping. This is the one we switched to when we added
surface cached lighting, because padding those textures widths to multiples of 256
would have been far too wasteful. I believe the "step table" indexed-by-carry-flag
trick used in this mapper came directly from Mike Abrash.

</p><p>
<div>Details for x86 programmers:
<p>
Here is the code for the second pixel of the non-power-of-two texture-mapper-unrolled-8-times:
</p><pre>        adc    ebx,edi
        add    eax,ebp

        sbb    edi,edi   ; save v carry
        add    esi,edx   ; update u

        mov    byte ptr _pt_buffer+1,al
        mov    al,[ebx]

        mov    edi,_pt_step_table[edi*4+4]
</pre>
<p>
Here is the code for the second pixel of the 256x256 texture-mapper-unrolled-8-times (not
used in the shipping game, unless maybe it was used for water
surface):
</p><pre>        add    esi,edx
        mov    ecx,ebx

        adc    bl,dl
        add    eax,ebp

        adc    bh,dh
        mov    al,[edi+ecx]

        mov    byte ptr _pt_buffer+1,al
        and    ebx,0babebeach
</pre>
<p>
The spacing of both pieces of code shows that they were optimized for the
Pentium; each one uses a nominal 4 cycles per pixel. (They also both would trigger
"Partial Register Stalls" on the Pentium Pro.) The Pentium had a 2-cycle "AGI" stall
that you couldn't use a register as an address for 2 cycles after it's
computed, so you can see the texture fetch (from ebx or edi+ecx) is
designed to compute those registers two cycles before the fetch.
The full 8-pixel routines use 32 and 33 Pentium-pairs of instructions
for 8 pixels (although there's also setup to get the right values into
the right registers).
</p><p>
The 0babebeach at the end there is a 0xdeadbeef-style constant that relied
on "self-modifying" code to update the constant, a common trick on the
486 and Pentium. Those processor had an "and ebx,memory_location" instruction,
but it wasn't single-cycle, whereas "and ebx,#immediate" was single-cycle.
This meant there were 9 places in the code that had to be modified (this
is an 8-unrolled loop, plus the non-unrolled loop), but only when the
texture was changed.
</p></div>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, I totally missed out on the possibility of reblocking the
texture to improve cache usage, which might have allowed significant
performance improvements (I don't know); I've heard that Build and
other engines did do this, and since the surface cache in Thief was built in
8x8 blocks anyway it probably wouldn't have been hard to support on
that end.

</p><h2><a name="textureeffects"></a>Texture-mapping effects</h2>
<p>
Looking Glass games generally demanded flexibility, and graphics engines
faced with that need for flexibility often had a combinatorial explosion
of texture mappers to handle all the different cases. The texture mappers
I wrote for Thief sacrificed a litttle performance for the sake of simplicity
and maintainability and maximum flexibility; the texture mapping routines
above ended with an indirect branch which would branch to a routine that
would decide what to do with the 8 pixels that had just been written into
a temporary buffer.
</p><p>
There were two kinds of functions that could be invoked at this point. The
most common kind was one which wrote to the "framebuffer" (which was actually
just a block of RAM somewhere that would be blitted to the screen later)
and returned from the original function call that invoked the texture mapper
chain.
The other kind of function would read the pixels from the temporary buffer,
modify them, and write them back to the temporary buffer, then jump to yet
another function. You could chain arbitrary numbers of these processing
functions, in theory, not that this turned out to be necessary.
</p><p>
The codebase had a bunch of these functions:

</p><ul>
<li>sampler for pitch=256 affine-sampled span with texture coordinate wrapping
</li><li>sampler for arbitrary pitch affine-sampled span with no wrapping or clamping
</li><li>sampler for arbitrary pitch with lighting-table lookup (fetching 8 distinct
lighting values from a temp lighting buffer)
</li><li>filter that adds 8 distinct 8-bit "paletted lighting values" from a temp
lighting buffer to 8 texture values in temp buffer and stores back to temp buffer
(just 2 32-bit adds)
</li><li>filter that runs 8 texture values from temp buffer through an arbitrary
remapping table (color lookup table) and stores back to buffer
</li><li>writer that writes to the framebuffer (32-bits at a time)
</li><li>writer that writes non-zero values to the framebuffer for transparency
(uses an operation that tests for zeroes 4-bytes at a time, so particularly
efficient if all are opaque or all are transparent)
</li><li>writer that runs the value in the framebuffer and the value in the temp
buffer through an arbitrary remapping table (used for "translucency" effects)
</li></ul>

and a few more pre-baked combinations of those, plus a few things to generate
gouraud-shading values into the temp lighting buffer. (And two versions of
each of the above--one unrolled for 8 pixels, and one for arbitrary N pixels,
to handle the beginning and ending of each span of pixels.)
<p>
Most of those weren't used, I think. Paletted lighting in particular required setting up
the palette in a particular way, and I used this in the original research engine
to demo a gouraud-shaded level running at 640x400 at 20-ish fps on a Pentium 90. The level was
a retextured version of Doom 1 E1M1, using a texture made by Kurt Bickenbach.
He and I iterated a bit trying to figure out how to make textures that would
look good and not too banded in 8-bit using paletted lighting, and we got some
visually pleasing results, but in the end paletted lighting was too limited,
so we abandoned it. (It was too limited artistically, and it couldn't do pitch black properly;
when we ended up with a shadow-oriented game it was clearly wrong, but I
think it had been abandoned long before due to the first issue.) Abandoning
it meant abandoning hitting that frame rate/resolution target as well, but
in the long run this didn't matter that much because LGS games were complicated
enough that it's not like we spent 95% of the frame time in the renderer anyway,
and we didn't ship it for a long time anyway.
</p><p>
The engine supported specifying an arbitrary color look-up table ("clut") for each portal,
and coloring
everything seen through that portal with that clut. This wasn't done by applying
this as a post-process on that portal surface, which would have used extra "fill
rate", but by storing cluts (and concatenating
them into new cluts) and applying them while rendering surfaces seen through the
portal. This effect could have been used to make force fields or such things, although
it ended up underutilized. (Note, though, that if a single cell were visible through
multiple paths, and the paths had different sequences of cluts, there was no correct
way to render it; the Thief engine chose randomly. Probably there was no good solution
to this problem, but since it was never exercised, it didn't matter.)
</p><p>
During development, this was used to make water "foggy", where the more
underwater portals away something was, the more opaque the water became. However, this
looked pretty terrible as it showed the portal boundaries clearly and although we had
all gotten used to it since it was in the engine for years, I did eventually turn
off the portal-varying underwater fog, replacing it with a fixed underwater fog.
</p><p>
It was also used to color
the water surface--the water surface
actually used a purely transparent texture and surfaces underwater were colored
while they were rendered, instead of having to use the "translucent" read-modify-write
mapper. This means the object renderers also needed to support
rendering with a clut; I don't remember the details since I didn't work on those,
but this was probably something we tended to support by default anyway, so I doubt
this was problematic for those renderers.
</p><p>
I'm not sure what happened for objects that stuck through the water surface; I guess
those were forced to use the dynamic user clip plane path. Because Quake used a z-buffer,
Quake couldn't have both a distant wall-underwater and the water surface visible at the
same pixel (the z-buffer could only store one depth), so the Quake water surface was
opaque, at least in the software renderer. I'm not sure what Quake-derived engines
like Half-Life did; one expensive solution would be to render the world except the
water, then render the objects, then finally render the transparent water through the
z-buffer (much as we do with hardware). The z-buffered transparent water effect
would have been much more expensive in pixel costs than Thief's approach, although
Thief was spending more effort per
triangle/vertex having to render the object multiple times.
</p><p>
In Thief, most world surfaces simply used the arbitrary-pitch no-wrapping sampler and the
plain store-to-memory writer.
</p><p>
I imagine that the object renderers used the shared LGS software rendering
libraries and so didn't use these mappers at all.

I didn't write all the graphics technology used in Thief. I'll call out the
things I didn't write below. I associate each of them with someone at LGS
who did the work, but I'm not sure the people I can think of were the only
contributors to that effort, so rather than risk missing important people
out, I'm just not going to name names if multiple people might have been involved.
</p><p>
The 3D camera system,
vertex transformation, and clipping processing were part of a shared technology
library used by all LGS products. (Thief may have been the first customer of
that tech--previous games having used fixed-point so they could run on x86 computers
without floating point acceleration.) Thief batched together all the vertices
used in a single cell and transformed them all at once, whether they were
visible polygons or portals, which was possible since the 3D vertex API allowed
separating things out like that. (Sort of like compiled vertex arrays.)
</p><p>
As noted before, general object rendering presumably also went through shared
libraries. Object polygons were sorted using a BSP tree; James
Fleming had written a very clever system that significantly reduced the number
of BSP node decisions that needed to be made, based on the fact that single-sided
polygons often couldn't occlude each other from any angle. (For example, I
believe a polygonal torus, which is an object that self-occludes and needs
sorting if the polygons are two-sided, can be statically sorted if it's made
of single-sided polygons.)
</p><p>
Most importantly, Thief used character skinning with skeletal animation to render
its characters, and I never touched a single line of code of that system.
</p><p>
I quit Looking Glass for a time; during my absence hardware acceleration support
was added. (I came back and added support for colored lighting in the lighting
generator and maybe the surface cache or something.)
