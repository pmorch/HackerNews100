<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>OldUnreal just posted this announcement on their <a href="https://discord.gg/thURucxzs6">Discord</a>:</p>

<p>"Welcome Back, Unreal Tournament 2004!</p>

<p>Hi everyone! Some of you were probably wondering why we've been so quiet in the past couple of months. Today, we can finally reveal (part of) the answer: we've been working on a new side project! With Epic's blessing and with the help of some new team members, we are bringing Unreal Tournament 2004 (UT2004) back.</p>

<p>This means that we are going to publish an installer that downloads the original disc image for UT2004, installs the game, and applies patches to it. We are also going to start publishing patches that modernize the game, make it compatible with Windows Vista or later, Linux x86-64 and aarch64 (Raspberry Pi and similar), and Mac OS 10.9 or later, fix bugs, and implement quality-of-life changes.</p>

<p>Yes, you read that right. <strong>UT2004 will soon be available to download once again. Free of charge.</strong> This is a community-run effort but we’re excited to make the game easier to access and play again. We have been working on this for quite some time now and have made enough progress to start inviting the first batch of testers.</p>

<p>Highlights so far include:</p>

<ul>
<li>We now natively support modern Linux and macOS systems with 64-bit Intel and ARM/Apple CPUs</li>
<li>You can now play the game or run a server on a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5, albeit at a lower frame rate than on a PC!</li>
<li>The Linux and macOS distributions of the patch now include a fully functional UCC with an UnrealScript compiler (UCC make) and texture compression support</li>
<li>The Linux and macOS distributions now use SDL3 instead of SDL1</li>
<li>D3D9Drv and fullscreen support are fully functional in the Windows 64-bit client</li>
<li>We dealt our first (minor) blow to the editor goblin! We fixed several crash bugs, restored some broken functionality, and, most importantly, the editor will no longer freeze for several seconds when you click a viewport</li>
</ul>

<p>❓ Q&amp;A ❓</p>

<p>Some questions might have popped into your head as you read this news. Let us try to answer some of them.</p>

<p>Q: Will the OldUnreal patches be compatible with the latest official version of the game?</p>

<p>A: Yes, for the most part. Unpatched clients can play on patched servers and patched clients can play on unpatched servers.</p>

<p>Most mods should also continue to work as before. The only exceptions are mods that perform game version checks and exclude players with unknown game versions.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, AntiTCC is one of those mods.</p>

<p>Q: Will AntiTCC be updated to support the new patches?</p>

<p>A: Yes. Wormbo gave us permission to update AntiTCC. This is still a work in progress, though.</p>

<p>Q: As a server admin, how do I ensure that players with the new version can continue to play on my servers?</p>

<p>A: We're aware of a network compatibility problem caused by an unofficial patch.</p>

<p>This problem results in players with the new version not being able to connect to (some) old servers.</p>

<p>You can mitigate this problem by (re)installing the official 3369.3 version of the offending files on your server.</p>

<p>Similarly, players that have installed this unofficial patch might need to reinstall the official 3369.3 files to play on updated servers.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we're looking into an alternative solution that does not require reinstalling the 3369.3 patch.</p>

<p>Q: Can I apply the OldUnreal patch to the retail version of the game?</p>

<p>A: On Windows: absolutely. Do keep in mind, however, that we do not support 32-bit CPUs.</p>

<p>On other platforms, your mileage may vary. Patching existing Linux/Mac OS X/macOS installations of the game is possible, but it could require a fair amount of manual effort.</p>

<p>We recommend installing the game from scratch following the instructions we provide in our README.</p>

<p>Q: What are your plans for the near future?</p>

<p>A: We are going to address the rough edges and unfinished features in the new version, and try our best to publish a preview installer and patch ASAP.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we will also work on some quality-of-life improvements and on the long list of editor fixes we want to port over from our other projects.</p>

<p>Q: What is the timeline?</p>

<p>A: We are currently inviting server admins and modders to join our internal tester group. We're aiming to release a public test version within the next two months.</p>

<p>Q: How can I contribute?</p>

<p>A: We will be needing testers in the near future. Keep an eye on our Discord server to see when.</p>

<p>Q: Are you getting paid for this project?</p>

<p>A: No. We're doing this for free because we're fans of the game and we like a challenge. In fact, projects like these cost us a bit of money for server hosting, software licenses and subscriptions, certificates, etc, as we independently operate the games ourselves.</p>

<p>Q: Who is responsible for this project?</p>

<p>A: The main developers of the Windows installer and the patches are Buggie, Marco/Dots, Deaod, Metallicafan212, Piglet, CacoFFF, AnthraX, and Smirftsch.</p>

<p>The patch also includes contributions from Wormbo, Shambler, and Ryan C. Gordon (icculus).</p>

<p>We would also like to thank Epic for making this possible.</p>

<p>Please direct all support requests or questions to [us/OldUnreal], not Epic Games."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>You have long ago abandoned the JavaScript trademark, and it is causing
widespread, unwarranted confusion and disruption.</strong></p>
<p>JavaScript is the world’s most popular programming language, powering websites
everywhere. Yet, few of the millions who program in it realize that JavaScript
is a trademark you, Oracle, control. The disconnect is glaring: JavaScript has
become a general-purpose term used by countless individuals and companies,
independent of any Oracle product.</p>
<p><strong>Oracle’s hold on the JavaScript trademark clearly fits the legal definition of
trademark abandonment</strong>. A previous
<a href="https://tinyclouds.org/trademark">blog post</a> addressed this issue, requesting
that you, Oracle, release the trademark. Unsurprisingly, the request was met
with silence. It is therefore time to take active steps in order to bring the
JavaScript trademark into the public domain, where it belongs.</p>
<h2>Trademark abandonment</h2>
<p>Title 15 of the United States Code, section 1127, states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=15-USC-3344077-1913738695&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">mark</a>&nbsp;shall
be deemed to be “abandoned” if either of the following occurs:</p>
<ol>
<li>When

Intent not to resume may be inferred from circumstances. Nonuse for 3
consecutive years shall be prima facie evidence of abandonment.
“<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=15-USC-85351-1913738695&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">Use</a>”

Purchaser motivation shall not be a test for determining abandonment under
this paragraph.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>In the case of JavaScript, both criteria apply</strong>.</p>
<h2>Netscape, Sun, Oracle</h2>
<p>The JavaScript trademark is currently held by Oracle America, Inc.
(<a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=75026640&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">US Serial Number: 75026640, US Registration Number: 2416017</a>).
How did this come to be?</p>
<p>In 1995, Netscape partnered with Sun Microsystems to create interactive
websites. Brendan Eich famously spent only 10 days creating the first version of
JavaScript, a dynamic programming language with a rough syntactic lineage from
Sun’s Java language. As a result of this partnership, Sun held the JavaScript
trademark. In 2009, Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems and the JavaScript
trademark as a result.</p>
<p>The trademark is simply a relic of this acquisition. Neither Sun nor Oracle has
ever built a product using the mark. Legal staff, year after year, have renewed
the trademark without question. It’s likely that only a few within Oracle even
know they possess the JavaScript trademark, and even if they do, they likely
don’t understand the frustration it causes within the developer community.</p>
<h2>Use it or lose it</h2>
<p><strong>Oracle has abandoned the JavaScript trademark through nonuse.</strong></p>
<p>Oracle has never seriously offered a product called JavaScript. In the 1990s and
early 2000s, Netscape Navigator, which supported JavaScript as a browser
feature, was a key player. However, Netscape’s usage and influence faded by
2003, and the browser saw its final release in 2008. JavaScript, meanwhile,
evolved into a widely used, independent programming language, embedded in
multiple browsers, entirely separate from Oracle.</p>
<p>The most recent
<a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=75026640&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch">specimen</a>,
filed with the USPTO in 2019, references <a href="http://nodejs.org/">nodejs.org</a> (a
project created by Ryan Dahl, the author of this letter) and Oracle’s
<a href="https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/index.html">JavaScript Extension Toolkit (JET)</a>.
But Node.js is not an Oracle product, and JET is merely a set of JavaScript
libraries for Oracle services, particularly Oracle Cloud. There are millions of
JavaScript libraries; JET is not special.</p>
<p>(Oracle is not even a member of the OpenJS Foundation - the body that the
Node.js project lives under now. Nor does Oracle have any involvement whatsoever
in the development of Node.js.)</p>
<p>Oracle also offers <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/graalvm/">GraalVM</a>, a JVM that
can execute JavaScript, among other languages. But GraalVM is far from a
canonical JavaScript implementation; engines like V8, JavaScriptCore, and
SpiderMonkey hold that role. GraalVM’s product page doesn’t even mention
“JavaScript”; you must dig into the documentation to find its support.</p>
<p><strong>Oracle’s use of JavaScript in GraalVM and JET does not reflect genuine use of
the trademark.</strong> These weak connections do not satisfy the requirement for
consistent, real-world use in trade.</p>
<h2>A generic term</h2>
<p>A mark can also be considered abandoned if it becomes a generic term.</p>
<p>In 1996, Netscape
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981203070212/http://cgi.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease289.html">announced</a>
a meeting of the ECMA International standards organization to standardize the
JavaScript programming language. Sun (now Oracle), refused to give up the
“JavaScript” mark for this use though, so it was decided that the language would
be called “ECMAScript” instead. (Microsoft happily offered up “JScript”, but
no-one else wanted that.) Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript and a
co-signatory of this letter,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200621202321/https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/2006-October/000133.html">wrote in 2006</a>
that “<em>ECMAScript was always an unwanted trade name that sounds like a skin
disease</em>.”</p>
<p>Ecma International formed TC39, a technical steering committee, which publishes
ECMA-262, the specification for JavaScript. This committee includes participants
from all major browsers, like Google’s Chrome, Apple’s Safari, and Mozilla’s
Firefox, as well as representatives from server-side JavaScript runtimes like
Node.js and Deno.</p>
<p>Oracle’s ownership of the JavaScript trademark only causes confusion. The term
“JavaScript” is used freely by millions of developers, companies, and
organizations around the world, with no interference from Oracle. Oracle has
done nothing to assert its rights over the JavaScript name, likely because they
do not believe their claim to the mark would hold up in court. Unlike typical
trademark holders who protect their trademarks by extracting licensing fees or
enforcing usage restrictions, Oracle has allowed the JavaScript name to be used
by anyone. This inaction further supports the argument that the trademark has
lost its significance and has become generic.</p>
<p>Programmers working with JavaScript have formed innumerable community
organizations. These organizations, like the standards bodies, have been forced
to painstakingly avoid naming the programming language they are built around—for
example, <a href="https://jsconf.com/">JSConf</a>. Sadly, without risking a legal trademark
challenge against Oracle, there can be no “JavaScript Conference” nor a
“JavaScript Specification.” The world’s most popular programming language cannot
even have a conference in its name.</p>
<p><strong>There is a vast misalignment between the trademark’s ownership and its
widespread, generic use</strong>.</p>
<h2>Free the mark</h2>
<p><strong>By law, a trademark is abandoned if it is either not used or becomes a generic
term. Both apply to JavaScript.</strong></p>
<p>It’s time for the USPTO to end the JavaScript trademark and recognize it as a
generic name for the world’s most popular programming language, which has
multiple implementations across the industry.</p>
<p>Oracle, you likely have no real business interest in the mark. It’s renewed
simply because legal staff are obligated to renew all trademarks, regardless of
their relevance or use.</p>
<p>We urge you to release the mark into the public domain. However, asking nicely
has been <a href="https://tinyclouds.org/trademark">tried before</a>, and it was met with
silence. If you do not act, we will challenge your ownership by filing a
petition for cancellation with the USPTO.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>In democracies, major policy decisions typically require some form of majority or consensus, so elites must secure mass support to govern. Historically, elites could shape support only through limited instruments like schooling and mass media; advances in AI-driven persuasion sharply reduce the cost and increase the precision of shaping public opinion, making the distribution of preferences itself an object of deliberate design. We develop a dynamic model in which elites choose how much to reshape the distribution of policy preferences, subject to persuasion costs and a majority rule constraint. With a single elite, any optimal intervention tends to push society toward more polarized opinion profiles - a ``polarization pull'' - and improvements in persuasion technology accelerate this drift. When two opposed elites alternate in power, the same technology also creates incentives to park society in ``semi-lock'' regions where opinions are more cohesive and harder for a rival to overturn, so advances in persuasion can either heighten or dampen polarization depending on the environment. Taken together, cheaper persuasion technologies recast polarization as a strategic instrument of governance rather than a purely emergent social byproduct, with important implications for democratic stability as AI capabilities advance.

                                            Unlike traditional orchestrators, there's no central control plane to
                                            maintain. Each machine maintains a synchronised copy of the cluster
                                            state
                                            through peer-to-peer communication, keeping cluster operations
                                            functional
                                            even if some machines go offline.

Dec 3, 2025</p>
<p>Why WinQuake exists and how it works</p><hr>
 

<p>When I took a look at the history of Quake binaries, they all made sense to me. <code>quake.exe</code> was the original release, able to run on DOS and Windows 95. Then came <code>vquake.exe</code> to support the hardware accelerated chip Vérité 1000. Later, <code>glquake.exe</code> generalized hardware acceleration to any vendor providing OpenGL drivers. And to revolutionize Internet deathmatch, id Software released QuakeWorld server and client (<code>qwsv.exe</code> and <code>qwcl.exe</code>).</p>

<p>However, I could not figure out the point of <code>winquake.exe</code>. Until now. Here is what I understood and a little bit of a dive into how it works.</p>

<p>Quake.exe performance</p><hr><p><code>quake.exe</code> runs on both DOS and Windows 95 but how well does it perform? A quick benchmark on my Pentium MMX 233MHz, Matrox Mystique PC (320x200 with 101 screen size) and sound on, showed the following numbers.</p>


<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Configuration</th>
    <th>Framerate</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>quake.exe</code> started from DOS</td>
    <td>
      <span>
         <b>48 fps</b>
      </span>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>quake.exe</code> started from Windows 95</td>
    <td>
       <span>
         <b>38 fps</b>
      </span>
     </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<!-- <pre>

233 Mhz quake,exe under dos   48 
        quake,exe under win   38  
</pre> -->
<p>So "framerate" is the beginning of an answer to justify the existence of WinQuake. <code>quake.exe</code> running from <i>Windows 95</i> is roughly 25% slower than the same binary started from DOS. And that is to be expected. <i>Windows 95</i> runs DOS applications in a virtual machine ("DOS BOX"), where memory access, interrupts, and signals are virtualized, which incurs overhead.</p>

<p>Another element of the answer comes from <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/quake_chunnel">Quake Chunnel</a>. <code>quake.exe</code> can access Windows 95 TCP/IP stack, but only via a convoluted tech from Mpath to bridge a "DOS BOX" to win32 dlls. By having a win32-only application, id Software had guaranteed direct access to <code>winsock.dll</code>.</p>

<p>Last but not least, id Software really wanted Quake to work on Windows NT. Despite their best efforts, the people at DJGPP could not make their DPMI client in <code>quake.exe</code> compatible with the NT Virtual DOS Machine (NTVDM).</p>

  
  <blockquote>
Near pointers don't work under NT - which was a huge disappointment to iD and generated some conference calls to Microsoft.
        
        <p>- Charles Sandmann<a name="back_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>



<p>How winquake.exe works</p><hr><p>A fun way to start exploring is to first read <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/winquake/WQREADME.TXT">WQREADME.TXT</a> and then take a look at all the modes available in <code>winquake.exe</code>. They are configured with the script <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/winquake/WQ.BAT">wq.bat</a>.</p>

<pre>Options for running WinQuake:
 wq max:      all features on, but doesn't work on all systems
 wq fast:     maximum speed, but doesn't work on all systems
 wq fastvid:  maximum video speed, but safer, probably slower sound
 wq fastsnd:  maximum sound speed, but safer, probably slower video
 wq safe:     very likely to run, but may be slower
 wq verysafe: almost sure to run, but probably slower, and no sound
</pre>  

<p>Here are the numbers I got for each mode, still with the same Pentium MMX 233MHz machine and same configuration.</p>


<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Configuration</th>
    <th>Framerate</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>wq max</code></td>
    <td>42.4 fps&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
      <tr>
    <td><code>wq fast</code></td>
    <td>41.8 fps&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
      <tr>
    <td><code>wq fastvid</code></td>
    <td>
  
      <span>
         <b>45.0 fps&nbsp;</b>
      </span>
    </td> 
    
  
  </tr> 
      <tr>
    <td><code>wq fastsnd</code></td>
    <td>41.8 fps&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
      <tr>
    <td><code>wq safe</code>
    </td>
    <td>
          <span>
         <b>45.0 fps&nbsp;</b>
      </span>
  </td>
  </tr>
      <tr>
    <td><code>wq verysafe</code>
    </td>
    
    <td>
    <span>
         <b>40.0 fps*</b>
      </span>
  </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>


<p>Impressive. <code>winquake.exe</code> managed to bring up the framerate within 6% of <code>quake.exe</code> running on DOS. Mission accomplished. But how does it works?</p>


<p>winQuake.exe backends</p><hr><p>Each "mode" is configured via command-line flags.  This part reveals there are three types of backend for input controls, audio, and video.</p>

<pre><b>max</b>      winquake                                                              -dinput
<b>fast</b>     winquake 
<b>fastvid</b>  winquake -wavonly
<b>fastsnd</b>  winquake          -nodirectdraw -nowindirect
<b>safe</b>     winquake -wavonly -nodirectdraw -nowindirect 
<b>verysafe</b> winquake                                     -dibonly -nosound -nojoy
</pre>

<p>Amusingly, the mode that provides the highest framerate, <code>fastvid</code> keeps everything default but disables an audio backend!</p> 

<p>"fastvid" was also the name of a <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/winquake/fastvid.txt">tool</a> to fix the Pentium Pro abysmal video write speed on chipset that shipped with buggy "Write Posting". The option in <code>qw.bat</code> has nothing to do with it.</p>


<p>Audio backends</p><hr><p>WinQuake can send its sound effects (the music comes from CD tracks) using two audio backends (with <code>-nosound</code> disables sound effects altogether).</p>

<p>The two backends are <i>DirectSound</i> (<code>dsound.h</code> from DirectX) and what id calls <i>wave sound</i> which is in fact <code>winmm.h</code>, the Windows MultiMedia audio API, dating back to Windows 3.1.</p>

<p>If DirectSound is available, WinQuake uses it to provide the lowest latency. However this backend has a higher impact on the CPU and results in 10% lower framerate. With <code>-wavonly</code>, users can force usage of <code>WinMM</code> which results in higher latency but higher framerate.</p>

<p>Input Control backends</p><hr><p>To read user inputs, WinQuake uses either <i>DirectInput</i> (<code>dinput.h</code> from DirectX) or the legacy Windows API <code>winuser.h</code>.

</p><p>By default WinQuake uses <code>winuser.h</code> but usage of DirectInput can be requested via <code>-dinput</code> for slightly smoother motion and responsiveness to fast spinning motions. I suspect it was not enabled by default for cases where DirectX was not installed or perhaps fear of driver problems.</p>

<p>Joystick inputs are handled with <code>joystickapi.h</code>. Likewise, it seems drivers may not have been stable since id provided a way to disable it with <code>-nojoy</code>.</p>

<p>Video backends</p><hr> 
<p>The part that was the most interesting to me was the video backends. WinQuake can operate in five modes using GDI, VGA, VESA, Accelerated VESA, or DirectDraw.</p>

 



<p>DIB video backend</p><hr><p>The Graphics Device Interface (GDI) (<code>wingdi.h</code>) is the foundation to render anything on the desktop in Windows 95. Applications usually did not use it directly but instead called <code>winuser.h</code> (which in turns used low-level <code>wingdi.h</code>).</p>

<p>WinQuake can render to a Device-Independent Bitmaps (DIB) which is a surface to be blitted towards a window though GDI. The surface can be of any dimension so there are no "display mode" to detect here, WinQuake hardcodes its DIB modes to square-pixel resolutions 320x240, 640x480, and 800x600.</p>

<p>Because it is using Windows "by the book", DIB mode is the safest mode that should always work. It is also the slowest way to render to the screen because WinQuake first renders to a DIB that is then sent to the GDI and then sent to the video card.</p>

<p>While slower, it is not devoid of hardware acceleration. Many graphic cards wanting to perform well under Windows 95 had hardware acceleration implementation of crucial functions such as <code>bitBlt</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, DIB mode is the only one able to render in "windowed" mode. Every other mode takes over and renders in "fullscreen" mode. Note that DIB can also render in pseudo-full screen if WinQuake is started with <code>dibonly</code> but this is "faked" with a borderless window covering the whole screen.</p>

  

<p>SciTech's Multi-platform Graphics Library (MGL)</p><hr><p>For everything not DIB, WinQuake uses SciTech's <i>MegaGraph Graphics Library</i>. It was a rather expensive lib ($499 in 1997, $1,000 in 2025)<a name="back_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> but well worth its price because it brought order into the chaos that was the world of video systems in 1997 if a game operated outside GDI.</p>

<p>WinQuake could find itself having to deal with the following types of video systems.</p>
<pre>1. VBEAF        : VESA Accelerator Function
2. VBE2         : VESA Linear Frame Buffer for direct to VRAM write/read.
3. DirectDraw   : Only available if DirectX is installed.
4. StandardVGA  : That good ol' VGA video mode.
</pre>

<p>When it starts, WinQuake registers the drivers it wants MGL to load (see <code>registerAllDispDrivers</code>). MGL then lists all supported resolutions and pick the highest performance drivers to access each of them (in the order list above).</p>

<pre>void registerAllDispDrivers(void) {
  /* Even though these driver require WinDirect, we register
   * them so that they will still be available even if DirectDraw
   * is present and the user has disabled the high performance
   * WinDirect modes.
   */
  <b>MGL_registerDriver</b>(MGL_VGA8NAME,VGA8_driver);

  if (useWinDirect){
    <b>MGL_registerDriver</b>(MGL_LINEAR8NAME,LINEAR8_driver);
    if (!COM_CheckParm ("-novbeaf"))
      <b>MGL_registerDriver</b>(MGL_ACCEL8NAME,ACCEL8_driver);
  }

  if (useDirectDraw) {
    <b>MGL_registerDriver</b>(MGL_DDRAW8NAME,DDRAW8_driver);
  }
}</pre>


<p>The list of modes and which driver was selected by MGL is available via the command <code>vid_describemodes</code> in Quake console. In the screenshot below, we can see almost the full house of drivers <code>VGA8.DRV</code>, <code>DDRAW.DRV</code>, <code>LINEAR8.DRV</code>, and the windowed DIB modes.</p>

<p>I had never heard of VBE/AF before reading MGL source code. As far as I understand, it never gained much traction and few vendors wrote drivers to support it.</p>


<p>Many games used MGL: WinQuake, Hexen II, Grand Theft Auto, Maui Mallard in Cold Shadow, Total Mayhem, Balls of Steel.</p>



<p>DirectDraw video system</p><hr><p>Microsoft was very much aware that GDI was fine for applications but not enough for video games. Already in Windows 3.1 they had released a game developer SDK called WinG to give a more direct fullscreen access to the screen. The second version of WinG was renamed DirectX and contained the 2D fullscreen API which they called DirectDraw.</p>  



<blockquote>
Although safer and more reliable, Microsoft Windows imposed many restrictions on applications.
One result of this situation was that games, and other high-performance graphics applications,
could no longer access the hardware resources directly in order to maximize performance and
expand functionalities. For several years game programmers continued to exercise the craft in
DOS, and Windows users had to switch to the DOS mode to run games, simulations, and other
graphics programs. The resulting situation implied a major contradiction: a graphical operating
system in which graphics applications would execute with marginal performance
<p>
The first effort in this direction was a product named WinG,
in reference to Windows for Games. WinG was first made available in 1994 and it required Win32
in Windows 3.1. Its main feature is that WinG enabled the game programmer to rapidly transfer
bitmaps from system memory into video memory. This made possible the creation of Windows
games that executed with much better performance.
</p><p>
Microsoft renamed the new version of the Game SDK, calling it DirectX 2. Other versions later
released were named DirectX 3, DirectX 5, DirectX 6, and currently, DirectX 7. 
</p><p>- Feng Yuan, "Windows Graphics Programming Win32 GDI and DirectDraw"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In terms of performance, DirectDraw was a step up from GDI but it was also not guaranteed to work due to driver bugs or if the user had not installed DirectX. It can be disabled with <code>nodirectdraw</code>.</p>

<p>WinDirect video system</p><hr><p>Readers may have picked up on something written earlier that was blatantly wrong. Direct access to the hardware is forbidden to Win32 applications. So how is  MGL able to bypass GDI/DirectDraw and directly hit VBEAF, VBE, and VGA?</p>

<p>That is possible thanks to the secret tech from <i>SciTech</i> called WinDirect. How it works is explained in <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/winquake/SciTech%20MGL%20Reference%20Guide%20v4.pdf">SciTech MGL Reference Guide v4.pdf</a>.</p>

  <blockquote>
<b>What is WinDirect?</b><p>

A key component of the SciTech MGL, WinDirect is a runtime package for
DOS and Windows 95 that provides direct access to the display hardware
for both 16 and 32-bit applications. Traditionally Windows applications
have had to perform all graphics output using the standard Graphics Device
Interface (GDI). Although the GDI is very extensive and powerful, it is also
not particularly fast for the sort of graphics that real time applications like
interactive video games require.</p><p>

WinDirect breaks this barrier by allowing high performance applications to
shut down the normal GDI interface, and to take over the entire graphics
display hardware just like you would normally do under DOS. Once GDI
has been shut down, interactive graphics applications can re-program the
display controller and write directly to video memory. A WinDirect
application can program any standard VGA graphics mode such as
320x200x256, it can re-program the controller and run standard VGA ModeX
style graphics, or it can call the standard VESA BIOS services to run high
resolution SuperVGA graphics.</p><p>- MGL v4 Programmer Guide<a name="back_3" href="#footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
 
<p>MGL v4 <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/winquake/mgl_v4_programmer_guide.pdf">programmer guide</a>, is a treasure strove of information. If, like me, you wondered what were these <code>WDIR32.DLL</code> and <code>WDIR16.DLL</code> libraries that came with WinQuake, the doc mentions them (<b>W</b>in<b>DIR</b>ect). Likewise, the doc describes <code>PMPRO16.DLL</code> and <code>PMPRO32.DLL</code> as <i>DOS extender independent API for protected mode services</i>. Michael Abrash's Zen Timer is also mentioned in there :)!</p>


<div><p>WinQuake source code does not include MGL. Only the headers and a pre-compiled 32-bit <code>MGLLT.LIB</code> (MGL Lite) are provided to allow compilation. SciTech did eventually publish the source in 2000<a name="back_4" href="#footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> but it is <a href="http://www.scitechsoft.com/dp_mgl.html">no longer available</a>. What was uploaded on GitHub<a name="back_5" href="#footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> is v5 which by then had dramatically changed (e.g: WinDirect was gone).</p><p>

Luckily a kind soul has mirrored <a href="http://ftp.lanet.lv/ftp/mirror/x2ftp/msdos/programming/scitech/00index.html">MGL v4</a>. If you want to do your own digging, install mglb405.exe and mgls405.exe. Or just download my installation, <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/winquake/src.zip">src.rar</a>.</p></div>

<p>Putting it all together</p><hr><p>Overall, <code>winquake.exe</code> was often able to find a fast rendering path, either through DirectDraw or WinDirect. The fallback to DIB mode was not ideal but still a win compared to <code>quake.exe</code>. Add to that the ability to select a sound backend to optimize for framerate or audio latency and the result was a damn good experience that completely justified the effort.</p>

<p>More than 30 years later, you can still run <code>winquake.exe</code> on Windows 11. Fullscreen does not support widescreen but the windowed mode still works flawlessly. As much as Microsoft has been questionable lately, their commitment to backward compatibility is impressive.</p><p>References</p><hr><p id="paperbox"><table><tbody><tr><td><a name="footnote_1"></a><a href="#back_1">^</a></td><td> [1]</td><td><a href="https://groups.google.com/g/comp.os.msdos.djgpp/c/VD-mIK56h74/m/P5zE_uabjnEJ">Why did ID choose DJGPP for Quake?</a></td></tr><tr><td><a name="footnote_2"></a><a href="#back_2">^</a></td><td> [2]</td><td><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/scitech-releases-mgl-40-opengl-source-code/1100-2467345/">SciTech's MGL price</a></td></tr><tr><td><a name="footnote_3"></a><a href="#back_3">^</a></td><td> [3]</td><td><a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/winquake/mgl_v4_programmer_guide.pdf">MGL v4 Programmer Guide</a></td></tr><tr><td><a name="footnote_4"></a><a href="#back_4">^</a></td><td> [4]</td><td><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/scitech-releases-mgl-40-opengl-source-code/1100-2467345/">SciTech Releases MGL 4.0 OpenGL Source Code</a></td></tr><tr><td><a name="footnote_5"></a><a href="#back_5">^</a></td><td> [5]</td><td><a href="https://github.com/kendallb/scitech-mgl/">SciTech Mult-platform Graphics Library</a></td></tr></tbody></table></p> <hr>

<h3 id="preamble">Preamble</h3>
<p><em>I would like to share with you this article I wrote about the ACME protocol, which I “fell in love with” about ten years ago. It is for me a way to give back to this fantastic Free Software and Open Protocols developers community.</em></p>
<p><em>This article is about the roots, the conception, the standardization, the relation with its ecosystem and the evolution challenges faced by the ACME protocol.</em></p>
<p><em>To write this article, I had the privilege of interviewing several people who have been involved in the creation and the evolution of ACME: <a href="https://aarongable.com/#about">Aaron Gable</a>, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2023/12/28/eoy-letter-2023">Sarah Gran</a>, <a href="https://www.eff.org/about/staff/jacob-hoffman-andrews">Jacob Hoffman-Andrews</a> and <a href="https://insufficient.coffee/about/">J.C. Jones</a> (more below).</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you so much to all of you for your time and support! 💚</em></p>
<h2 id="internet-and-network-protocols">Internet and Network Protocols</h2>
<h3 id="open-and-standardized-protocols-at-the-heart-of-the-internets-success">Open and Standardized Protocols at the Heart of the Internet’s Success</h3>
<p>During the 1990s, computing underwent a true revolution driven by the rise and global spread of the Internet. The Internet fulfilled the promise embodied in Sun Microsystems’ slogan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Network_is_the_Computer"><em>“The Network is the Computer”</em></a>.</p>
<p>By interconnecting individual computers, the Internet enabled its users to communicate without limits and without worrying about borders.</p>
<p>This unrestricted interconnection emerged at a pivotal moment in modern history: the opposition between the West and the Eastern Bloc led by the USSR had—albeit temporarily, as we now know—faded away, China was becoming the world’s factory, and the movement and collaboration between people were much freer and open than ever.</p>
<p>The Internet supported a kind of utopia of instant communication and sharing, previously unknown. This utopia was made possible by a set of open and standardized protocols. This was the key to enabling all kinds of different systems to cooperate and communicate seamlessly.</p>
<p>There were, of course, isolationist or monopolistic temptations from certain manufacturers or software editors. But open and standardized protocols ultimately prevailed, enabling unprecedented expansion. Built on top of IP, TCP, UDP, and DNS, among others, the HTTP and HTML duo would propel the Web as the Internet’s preferred communication platform for the next 30 years.</p>
<h3 id="limited-use-of-encryption">Limited Use of Encryption</h3>
<p>The success of this communication utopia was achieved without much concern for ensuring authentication, integrity, and confidentiality of exchanges.</p>
<p>In 2015, only <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overview">~40%</a> of websites used encryption. The consequences of this negligence in addressing security risks were confirmed by Edward Snowden’s revelations in 2013: our data was exposed to anyone who wanted and could intercept and collect it.</p>
<h2 id="lets-encrypt-is-coming">Let’s Encrypt is coming</h2>

<p>When asked about the main obstacles to the widespread adoption of encryption, <a href="https://insufficient.coffee/about/">J.C. Jones</a>, one of the architects of Let’s Encrypt and now one of its site reliability engineers after leading Firefox’s cryptographic team, responds:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.brocas.org/assets/jc-jones100.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“More and more information was flowing across the Web, and most data being transferred did not have integrity or confidential protections from TLS. The biggest stumbling block to using TLS everywhere was obtaining and managing server-side certificates, and so: Let’s Encrypt” –  <strong>J.C. Jones</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obtaining a certificate was the main obstacle, and this was the priority to address.</p>
<p>This view was shared by a group of partners who, starting in 2013, pooled resources to establish Let’s Encrypt, an automated and free certificate authority. <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2023/12/28/eoy-letter-2023">Sarah Gran</a>, VP of Advancement at Let’s Encrypt, shares:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.brocas.org/assets/sarah-gran100.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Early collaborators included people from Mozilla, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Akamai, Cisco, and the University of Michigan” – <strong>Sarah Gran</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that’s how Let’s Encrypt was born.</p>
<p>In the Web ecosystem, certificate authorities are organizations from which you can obtain a certificate for a domain  after proving you control it.</p>
<p>And so, Let’s Encrypt is since 2015 a certificate authority that delivers for free (as in free beer) TLS Server certificates.</p>
<p>On the legal/administrative side, Let’s Encrypt certificate authority operates for the public’s benefit and is a service provided by the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG), a California public benefit corporation.</p>
<p>Regarding <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/stats/">Let’s Encrypt results</a> ten years after its birth, they are really impressive (over 700M active certificates, over <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/sc-letsencrypt">60%</a> of all the public TLS server certificates) and as Sarah Gran points out, so is the global HTTPS usage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“When we started issuance, only about 39% of website visits were HTTPS. Today, it’s nearly 95% in the United States, and over 83% globally. We still have work to do, but we are proud of the progress we’ve made over the last ten years” – <strong>Sarah Gran</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s Encrypt delivers certificates in a automated manner using the ACME protocol which implies no manual action from the site owner nor the certificate authority. So, let’s speak now a little about the automation aspect!</p>
<h3 id="automation-the-core-of-the-operation">Automation: The Core of the Operation</h3>
<p>From the mid-2020s perspective, the automation at the heart of Let’s Encrypt might seem obvious, but in the first half of the 2010s, it was far from the norm. The ecosystem of public certificate authorities issuing server certificates was no exception.</p>
<p>At first glance, automation appears to be there to help website managers reliably deploy the TLS protocol on their sites, but it was first and foremost an absolute prerequisite for the very viability of the Let’s Encrypt project.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://aarongable.com/#about">Aaron Gable</a>, tech lead of Boulder—the software at the core of Let’s Encrypt—, confirms:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.brocas.org/assets/aaron-gable100.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Automation was always going to be critical to Let’s Encrypt’s success. From the very beginning, we knew that there was no way we could scale manual validation on a non-profit’s budget” – <strong>Aaron Gable</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, it is worth noting that Let’s Encrypt has operated on an Internet scale from the start with a small team of about fifteen engineers, or even fewer at launch. For this team, automation was the only viable way to fulfill the immense mission they had set for themselves.</p>
<h2 id="acme">ACME</h2>
<h3 id="the-open-and-automated-protocol-that-powers-lets-encrypt">The Open and automated Protocol That Powers Let’s Encrypt</h3>
<p>When we talk about automation in relation to Let’s Encrypt, we are talking about <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555">ACME</a> (Automated Certificate Management Environment).</p>
<p>This protocol allows client software to prove to an ACME-compatible certificate authority that it controls the domain for which it is requesting a certificate.</p>
<p>Sarah Gran clarifies an important point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“An important aspect of how Let’s Encrypt works is that we verify control over a domain, not ownership” – <strong>Sarah Gran</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Control vs. ownership of a domain—a nuance everyone should keep in mind.</p>
<p>This proof of control involves the client responding to a challenge issued by the ACME-compatible certificate authority. The challenge can be an HTTP, DNS, or TLS challenge, depending on the client’s choice and certificate authority support. Completing the challenge requires the ACME client to place a value provided by the ACME server—in a standardized HTTP path, a DNS zone, or a TLS response, respectively. All of these operations involve cryptography, of course.</p>
<p>The key point with ACME is that this entire dialogue between the client and the ACME server is executed without any human intervention, enabling the automatic issuance of certificates. Their deployment and integration into the web service can also generally be automated using scripts triggered after issuance.</p>
<p>On the Let’s Encrypt website, you can discover more information about <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/">how ACME works</a> and get more <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/">detailled information</a> about it.</p>
<h3 id="birth-of-acme">Birth of ACME</h3>
<p>One might wonder whether ACME was part of Let’s Encrypt’s design from the beginning.</p>
<p>J.C. Jones confirms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“By late 2014, the idea of an HTTP REST API with “/challenge” and “/certificate” existed, but we hadn’t defined much beyond that. We had a series of in-person meetings, in the Mozilla San Francisco office on Embarcadero and the EFF office in the Tenderloin through the spring of 2015 where we worked out the details” – <strong>J.C. Jones</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>ACME was indeed at the core of Let’s Encrypt from the start and underwent a refinement process to cover all use cases as thoroughly as possible.</p>
<p>To learn more about the roots of ACME and Let’s Encrypt, there is a very informative document to read: the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3319535.3363192">Let’s Encrypt paper</a> for <a href="https://ccs2019.sigsac.org/">ACM CCS 2019</a> in London. It mentions the previous work of two teams:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“A group led by Alex Halderman at the University of Michigan and Peter Eckersley at EFF was developing a protocol for automatically issuing and renewing certificates. Simultaneously, a team at Mozilla led by Josh Aas and Eric Rescorla was working on creating a free and automated certificate authority”</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When these two teams discovered each other’s work, they joined forces. ACME and its implementation in Let’s Encrypt were the result of this joint effort supported by the initial partners mentioned above.</p>

<p>Speaking of use cases, one might wonder whether the Web was Let’s Encrypt’s primary target, or if securing the Internet with its multiple protocols was also part of the objectives.</p>
<p>Sarah Gran provides an unambiguous first-level answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“From Day One, we have sought to get the web to 100% encryption” – <strong>Sarah Gran</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But when asked about the various types of challenges in the protocol, J.C. Jones offers a nuance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“DNS, TLS-SNI, and HTTP were all in planning in spring 2015, but many of us were less confident in the procedure around the DNS validation. Which is ironic, as it turned out TLS-SNI had a vulnerability so we had to stop using it and our DNS validation was ultimately fine. In general, the collection of us were simply respectful of the great complexity within the DNS” – <strong>J.C. Jones</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a perspective not often publicly expressed by engineers primarily from the Web: their lack of confidence in implementing a DNS challenge stemmed from their humility regarding the complexity of the DNS ecosystem and the level of expertise required to master it.</p>
<p>The challenge was ultimately met, and this DNS challenge—though not its primary purpose—enabled multiple protocols outside HTTP like SMTP to be secured by ACME.</p>
<h2 id="standardization-and-open-source">Standardization and Open Source</h2>
<h3 id="developed-in-the-open">Developed in the Open</h3>
<p>ACME was documented openly from the start, and <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">Certbot</a>, the first open-source ACME client co-developed with the EFF, served as the client side reference implementation.</p>
<p>Similarly, a standardization process through the IETF resulted in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8555/">RFC 8555</a> in March, 2019.</p>
<p>One of the consequences developing an open and standardized protocol was the creation of a multitude of <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/">ACME clients covering a very wide range of use cases</a>.</p>
<p>J.C. Jones confirms that this was the goal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“This is what we foresaw, or at least hoped for. The initial client development often had conversations like, ‘oh, if someone wants that, then they’ll write their own client.’ It was a key part of why the REST API needed to be an IETF standard, and was part of the argument at the IETF BoF that resulted in the formation of the ACME Working Group in Q3 2015” – <strong>J.C. Jones</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s Encrypt has also always provided constant support to developers by responding in its forum or on its GitHub issue tracker, and all this work has truly paid off. <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/10/07/ten-yrs-community-forum">An interesting post</a> has been recently written about support on the Let’s Encrypt blog.</p>
<h3 id="standardization-for-what-benefits">Standardization for what benefits?</h3>
<p>The other question that can be asked is whether or not the standardization process within the IETF has led to an improvement in the ACME protocol thanks to the cooperation that guides this process.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/about/staff/jacob-hoffman-andrews">Jacob Hoffman-Andrews</a>, one of the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8555/">RFC 8555</a> authors working for EFF &amp; Let’s Encrypt, confirms an initial benefit that the ACME protocol has been able to derive from its standardization process:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.brocas.org/assets/jacob100.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“One of the big changes was from a validation-first flow to a certificate-request-first flow. In other words, earlier drafts had subscribers requesting validation for domain names and then requesting a certificate once those validations were successful. The final RFC has subscribers request a certificate, and then the CA tells the subscriber what validations are needed. This change originated from within the IETF discussion process, and was intended to make handling of wildcard certificates more natural.” – <strong>Jacob Hoffman-Andrews</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside this first design improvement, Jacob details a second major improvement of the security of the protocol, improvement that also landed during the IETF standardization process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Another big change, also originated from within the IETF, was to make all requests authenticated, including GET requests. Since ACME is authenticated with signed POSTs, this necessitated the POST-as-GET concept that’s in ACME today” – <strong>Jacob Hoffman-Andrews</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can see there how IETF iterations can challenge the security of a protocol and leads its development to innovative solutions to tackle the challenges it faces!</p>
<p>Last, Jacob adds another information that illustrates the benefits of developing a protocol into the open: it allows the community to evaluate (and sometimes, fix) its security level due to the availability of all materials and often, of the reference implementation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Another very important evolution was the deprecation of the tls-sni-01 challenge method. This was found to be flawed by Frans Rosen, a security researcher. It was replaced with TLS-ALPN-01, developed at IETF with significant input from Google” – <strong>Jacob Hoffman-Andrews</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="lets-encrypt-acme-and-the-public-certificate-authorities-ecosystem">Let’s Encrypt, ACME, and the Public Certificate Authorities Ecosystem</h3>
<p>In 2015, the arrival of Let’s Encrypt in the public certificate authorities ecosystem raised a number of questions.</p>
<p>What level of cooperation or hostility? What impact on the viability of existing certificate authorities?</p>
<p>Here again, the fact that Let’s Encrypt was based on an open protocol, immediately subject to an IETF standardization initiative, enabled collaboration and adoption by the most innovative certificate authorities.</p>
<p>I spoke about the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555/#section-7.3.4">External Account Binding</a> (EAB) option of the protocol with J.C. Jones. EAB is a way for an ACME client to authenticate to an ACME server using an identifier and a key value which are verifiable by the server in a repository it maintains. With EAB, an ACME server can filter who can uses its service which is useful for commercial certificate authorities for example; it is an alternative model to Let’s Encrypt one where anybody can ask for a certificate.</p>
<p>Using the example of EAB, J.C. Jones confirms the collaboration with certificate authorities that happens during the IETF standardization process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“EAB was an early addition at the IETF ACME Working Group. Many in the room were worried that without a means to bind to a payment method, ACME would not get adoption. In fact, some of the counterarguments to forming ACME were blunted by EAB, as such a mechanism wasn’t in the theoretically-competing, already-existent standard: SCEP. SCEP, it was argued, already handled ‘free’ certificate issuance, for private certificate authorities. Anything else needed a feasible path for usage payment.” – <strong>J.C. Jones</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond billing, the addition of EAB enabled also some commercial certificate authorities to integrate their existing domain control validation systems with ACME, allowing some of them to skip the challenge step of the ACME protocol.</p>
<p>The IETF standardization process, based on an open process, created the necessary discussion space for cooperation among entities that did not necessarily share the same objectives.</p>
<p>The result, ten years after the introduction of ACME and the completion of its standardization process in 2019, is that ACME has become the primary means by which all public certificate authorities—both free and commercial—rely on for their transition to an automated future of issuing short-lived certificates.</p>
<p>Effectively, until early this year, the maximum lifespan of a public TLS server certificate was set to 398 days by the CA/B Forum, the organization that set the rules for public certificate authorities. With the vote of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/2025/04/11/ballot-sc081v3-introduce-schedule-of-reducing-validity-and-data-reuse-periods/">ballot SC081</a> at the CA/B Forum in April 2025, it has been decided that the certificate lifespan will decrease gradually starting March 2026 to reach 47 days in March 2029. The automation provided by ACME seems to be one of the main identified levers to help organizations to adapt to this drastic reduction in the lifespan of public TLS server certificates.</p>
<h3 id="created-at-lets-encrypt-adopted-everywhere">Created at Let’s Encrypt, adopted everywhere</h3>
<p>It is important to note that although ACME was developed by the team managing Let’s Encrypt, this protocol is now one of the main protocols for automated certificate acquisition adopted by all public certificate authorities.</p>
<p>And outside the public certificate authorities ecosystem, I think it’s fair to say that this protocol is also becoming increasingly popular with technical architects in companies with private certificate authorities.</p>
<p>This has been the case in my company for several years now, where we have deployed an ACME endpoint in front of our internal certificate authority. Among the benefits we have seen, we have been able to rely on the vast ACME clients ecosystem in order to provide an ACME client to each OS or middleware that powers our infrastructure. We can see there how certificate obtention agility powered by ACME helps organizations in their journey to global IT agility.</p>
<h2 id="innovation-and-the-adoption-challenge">Innovation and the adoption challenge</h2>
<h3 id="the-ari-episode">The ARI episode</h3>
<p>We may fear that the development of a protocol supported primarily by a team as small as Let’s Encrypt’s will be fairly limited in terms of evolution and innovation.</p>
<p>But the history of ACME shows that its evolution continues after its initial standardization.</p>
<p>In 2025, we saw with the ARI (ACME Renewal Information – <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9773.html">RFC 9773</a>) extension that the ACME protocol continues to evolve. ARI is a way for a certificate authority to suggest a renewal period to its clients, often earlier than they would have determined themselves. This use case is particularly relevant when the certificate authority needs to mass-revoke certificates that, for example, did not comply with the rules the certificate authority must follow when issuing certificates.</p>
<p>More specifically, J.C. Jones and Aaron Gable point two incidents that had to be handled by the Let’s Encrypt team and that were the start for the ARI initiative:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Explicitly, as remediation of <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1619179">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1619179</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1715672">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1715672</a> " <strong>J.C. Jones and Aaron Gabble</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="support-to-encourage-adoption">Support to encourage adoption</h3>
<p>Aaron Gable leads the effort of designing and implementing ARI. But even if a new extension to the protocol has been produced, it can only reach its potential users after ACME clients have implemented it into their code base. As previously said, the team and some community members invest a lot on providing support to the community. In the case of ARI, this support is oriented to the ACME clients developers in order to make these clients ARI aware.</p>
<p>Providing an efficient support and effective resources to the client side ACME actors is a huge part of the challenge in order to keep ACME ecosystem healthy and agile.</p>
<p>As illustrates by Sarah Gran, another way to give momentum to a new feature is to lift certain restrictions on access to the certificate authority:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In order to encourage ARI adoption, we’ve configured Let’s Encrypt to allow subscribers who renew via ARI to bypass our rate limits.” – <strong>Sarah Gran</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="client-side-update-challenge">Client Side Update Challenge</h3>
<p>But despite a good support work and incentive measures, Aaron Gable confirms ARI adoption is just at its start:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“There is still much progress to be made. Part of the appeal of the Automated Certificate Management Environment is that many users can set-and-forget their client and configuration. This means that most clients never receive software updates, and even client projects that have implemented ARI in their latest version still have massive install bases that aren’t running that version. We’ve worked closely with many clients developers to implement ARI, and contributed implementations ourselves in several cases, but for widespread adoption the whole ecosystem will need to slowly turn over” <strong>– Aaron Gable</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This situation is really shared with a lot of client side softwares that <em>“just work”(c)</em> and it raises some concerns about how to make an ecosystem keeping track with innovation on its client side.</p>
<p>This challenge arises not only in terms of updating the client, but also in terms of updating the configuration. Many ACME clients rely on cron tasks. To have an efficient ARI setup, your task has to run ideally on a daily basis be able to ask the certification authority every day whether the certificate needs to be reissued. This is not the classic cron task setup. So, users have to modify this cron task frequency to reach the ARI goal of certificate reissuance led by certificate authority. Client side ACME setup evolution is a really challenging task.</p>
<h3 id="evolution-on-server-side-acme-implementation">Evolution on server side ACME implementation</h3>
<p>CA/B Forum has recently asked public certificate authorities to adopt <a href="https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2024/07/05/a-brief-history-of-multi-perspective-issuance-corroboration/">Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration</a> (MPIC) to guard against BGP attacks. We have asked Aaron Gable about the impacts that kind of measure have had on ACME server side implementation in the Let’s Encrypt infrastructure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We’ve had to make few if any changes to our infrastructure to accommodate recent requirements changes such as MPIC and DNSSEC validation. We innovated MPIC (then called Remote Validation) along with a research team at Princeton, and implemented it in 2020. Our experience already running such a service helped inform the requirements as they were incorporated by the CA/B Forum.” <strong>– Aaron Gable</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lesson learnt here is that being at the edge of the innovation let you shape part of the future of your ecosystem and significantly lower the impact on your infrastructure of many regulatory measures that come into effect over time.</p>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p>It is really encouraging to see a lot of innovation in the ACME ecosystem.</p>
<p>So what evolutions can we expect to see in the future?</p>
<p>We have asked the question to Aaron Gable who gave us two upcoming developments:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“We’re currently working on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-acme-profiles/">standardizing</a> <strong>profile selection for ACME</strong>, and our deployment of the early draft of this standard has already brought some much-needed flexibility to the WebPKI, enabling us to make changes to our certificate contents with minimal disruption.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m also excited about a potential future change which would <strong>introduce a ‘pubkey’ identifier type</strong>, along with a set of challenges that allow the client to demonstrate control over the corresponding keypair. This would fix the gap today that presenting a CSR does not actually prove possession of the key in that CSR.” – <strong>Araron Gable</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Fastly has also recently <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/smarter-acme-challenge-for-multi-cdn-world">contributed</a> to ACME in order to improve the <code>dns-01</code> challenge in a multi-cloud and multi-PKI environment. An <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-acme-dns-account-label/">IETF draft</a> describing this <code>dns-account-01</code> challenge is online. This is further proof that the public TLS ecosystem has truly embraced the ACME protocol as its primary automation tool.</p>
<p>Another recent development based on ACME has also shed new light on the potential of this protocol: since 2022, a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-acme-device-attest/">draft</a> is under progress at the IETF in order to write an ACME extension. The goal of this extension is to use ACME to obtain a certificate for a device in order to prove its identity. The challenge is based on device attestation and what’s new in this case is the arrival of a third party, the attestation server.</p>
<p>What is remarkable here is that we are no longer dealing with ACME’s initial use case, namely obtaining TLS server certificates: we can see in this IETF draft the potential of ACME as a challenge-based framework to obtain certificate in very different contexts.</p>
<p>Indeed, we can venture to say that ACME’s future looks bright 😊</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is heartening to see that, 30 years after the widespread adoption of the Internet, open and standardized protocols continue to revolutionize its use.</p>
<p>ACME and its Let’s Encrypt implementation at scale have enabled the widespread adoption of HTTPS, thereby raising the level of security for billions of Internet users and also of private networks.</p>
<p>Having been able to do it inside a non profit organization, providing the Internet with an open and standardized protocol is a great success for all people believing in FreeSoftware and an Open Internet.</p>
<p>As a community, I really think we can thank these organizations, teams, and engineers who continue to uphold the promise of efficiency and Freedom brought about by cooperation around open protocols. They inspire new generations (and older ones I guess 😉) demonstrating big things can still be achevied today in the open for the common good at the Internet scale!</p>
<p>I would like to extend a special thank you to the members of the Let’s Encrypt team, <strong>J.C. Jones</strong>, <strong>Aaron Gable</strong>, <strong>Sarah Gran</strong> and <strong>Jacob Hoffman-Andrews</strong>, for the time and effort they dedicated to answering my questions. Without them, this article would not have been possible.</p>
<p>A big shout out also to <a href="https://github.com/regit">Eric Leblond</a> and <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@doegox">Philippe Teuwen</a> who carefully proofread some early drafts of the article and <a href="https://github.com/phbnf">Philippe Bonnef</a> and <a href="https://thibmeu.com/">Thibault Meunier</a> for proofreading some of the last drafts. They all gave me so valuable and insightful advices 🙏</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <!-- OPENING: THE LUNCH -->
        <p>
          I grabbed lunch with a former Microsoft coworker I've always admired—one of those engineers who can take any idea, even a mediocre one, and immediately find the gold in it. I wanted her take on <a href="https://wanderfugl.com/" target="_blank">Wanderfugl</a> 🐦, the AI-powered map I've been building full-time. I expected encouragement. At worst, overly generous feedback because she knows what I've sacrificed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, she reacted to it with a level of negativity I'd never seen her direct at me before.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I finally got her to explain what was wrong, none of it had anything to do with what I built. She talked about Copilot 365. And Microsoft AI. And every miserable AI tool she's forced to use at work. My product barely featured. Her reaction wasn't about me at all. It was about her entire environment.
        </p>

        <h3>The AI Layoffs</h3>

        <p>
          Her PM had been laid off months earlier. The team asked why. Their director told them it was because the PM org "wasn't effective enough at using Copilot 365."
        </p>

        <p>
          I nervously laughed. This director got up in a group meeting and said that someone lost their job over this?
        </p>

        <p>
          After a pause I tried to share how much better I've been feeling—how AI tools helped me learn faster, how much they accelerated my work on Wanderfugl. I didn't fully grok how tone deaf I was being though. She's drowning in resentment.
        </p>

        <p>
          I left the lunch deflated and weirdly guilty, like building an AI product made me part of the problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          But then I realized this was bigger than one conversation. Every time I shared Wanderfugl with a Seattle engineer, I got the same reflexive, critical, negative response. This wasn't true in Bali, Tokyo, Paris, or San Francisco—people were curious, engaged, wanted to understand what I was building. But in Seattle? Instant hostility the moment they heard "AI."
        </p>

        <h2>The people at big tech in Seattle are not ok</h2>

        <p>
          When I joined Microsoft, there was still a sense of possibility. Satya was pushing "growth mindset" everywhere. Leaders talked about empowerment and breaking down silos. And even though there was always a gap between the slogans and reality, there was room to try things.
        </p>

        <p>
          I leaned into it. I pushed into areas nobody wanted to touch, like Windows update compression, because it lived awkwardly across three teams. Somehow, a 40% improvement made it out alive. Leadership backed it. The people trying to kill it shrank back into their fiefdoms. It felt like the culture wanted change.
        </p>

        <p>
          That world is gone.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the layoff directive hit, every org braced for impact. Anything not strictly inside the org's charter was axed. I went from shipping a major improvement in Windows 11 to having zero projects overnight. I quit shortly after. In hindsight, getting laid off with severance might've been better than watching the culture collapse in slow motion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then came the AI panic.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you could classify your project as "AI," you were safe and prestigious. If you couldn't, you were nobody. Overnight, most engineers got rebranded as "not AI talent." And then came the final insult: everyone was forced to use Microsoft's AI tools whether they worked or not.
        </p>

        <p>
          Copilot for Word. Copilot for PowerPoint. Copilot for email. Copilot for code. Worse than the tools they replaced. Worse than competitors' tools. Sometimes worse than doing the work manually.
        </p>

        <p>
          But you weren't allowed to fix them—that was the AI org's turf. You were supposed to use them, fail to see productivity gains, and keep quiet.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meanwhile, AI teams became a protected class. Everyone else saw comp stagnate, stock refreshers evaporate, and performance reviews tank. And if your team failed to meet expectations? Clearly you weren't "embracing AI."
        </p>

        <p>
          Bring up AI in a Seattle coffee shop now and people react like you're advocating asbestos.
        </p>

        <p>
          Amazon folks are slightly more insulated, but not by much. The old Seattle deal—Amazon treats you poorly but pays you more—only masks the rot.
        </p>

        <h2>Self-Limiting Beliefs</h2>

        <p>
          This belief system—that AI is useless and that you're not good enough to work on it anyway—hurts three groups:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>1. The companies.</strong><br>
          They've taught their best engineers that innovation isn't their job.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>2. The engineers.</strong><br>
          They're stuck in resentment and self-doubt while their careers stall.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>3. Anyone trying to build anything new in Seattle.</strong><br>
          Say "AI" and people treat you like a threat or an idiot.
        </p>

        <p>
          And the loop feeds itself:<br>
          Engineers don't try because they think they can't.<br>
          Companies don't empower them because they assume they shouldn't.<br>
          Bad products reinforce the belief that AI is doomed.<br>
          The spiral locks in.
        </p>

        <p>
          My former coworker—the composite of three people for anonymity—now believes she's both unqualified for AI work and that AI isn't worth doing anyway. She's wrong on both counts, but the culture made sure she'd land there.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seattle has talent as good as anywhere. But in San Francisco, people still believe they can change the world—so sometimes they actually do.

        <p>
            By combining the language of groups with that of geometry and linear algebra, Marius Sophus Lie created one of math’s most powerful tools.        </p>
        
    </div><div>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>In mathematics, <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/groups-underpin-modern-math-heres-how-they-work-20240906/">ubiquitous objects called groups</a> display nearly magical powers. Though they’re defined by just a few rules, groups help illuminate an astonishing range of mysteries. They can tell you which polynomial equations are solvable, for instance, or how atoms are arranged in a crystal.</p>
<p>And yet, among all the different kinds of groups, one type stands out. Identified in the early 1870s, Lie groups (pronounced “Lee”) are crucial to some of the most fundamental theories in physics, and they’ve made lasting contributions to number theory and chemistry. The key to their success is the way they blend group theory, geometry and linear algebra.</p>
<p>In general, a group is a set of elements paired with an operation (like addition or multiplication) that combines two of those elements to produce a third. Often, you can think of a group as the symmetries of a shape — the transformations that leave the shape unchanged.</p>
<p>Consider the symmetries of the equilateral triangle. They form a group of six elements, as shown here:</p>
</div>
    </div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>(Since a full rotation brings every point on the triangle back to where it started, mathematicians stop counting rotations past 360 degrees.)</p>
<p>These symmetries are discrete: They form a set of distinct transformations that have to be applied in separate, unconnected steps. But you can also study continuous symmetries. It doesn’t matter, for instance, if you spin a Frisbee 1.5 degrees, or 15 degrees, or 150 degrees — you can rotate it by any real number, and it will appear the same. Unlike the triangle, it has infinitely many symmetries.</p>
<p>These rotations form a group called SO(2). “If you have just a reflection, OK, you have it, and that’s good,” said <a href="https://www.unige.ch/math/en/section/enseignants-et-chercheurs-2/anton-alekseev">Anton Alekseev</a>, a mathematician at the University of Geneva. “But that’s just one operation.” This group, on the other hand, “is many, many operations in one package” — uncountably many.</p>
<p>Each rotation of the Frisbee can be represented as a point in the coordinate plane. If you plot all possible rotations of the Frisbee in this way, you’ll end up with infinitely many points that together form a circle.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/The_Geometry_of_Groups-crMarkBelan-Desktopv2.svg" alt="" decoding="async"><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/The_Geometry_of_Groups-crMarkBelan-Mobilev2.svg" alt="" decoding="async">    </p>
    </figure>

<p>This extra property is what makes SO(2) a Lie group — it can be visualized as a smooth, continuous shape called a manifold. Other Lie groups might look like the surface of a doughnut, or a high-dimensional sphere, or something even stranger: The group of all rotations of a ball in space, known to mathematicians as SO(3), is a six-dimensional tangle of spheres and circles.</p>
<p>Whatever the specifics, the smooth geometry of Lie groups is the secret ingredient that elevates their status among groups.</p>
<h2><strong>Off on a Tangent</strong></h2>
<p>It took time for Marius Sophus Lie to make his way to mathematics. Growing up in Norway in the 1850s, he hoped to pursue a military career once he finished secondary school. Instead, forced to abandon his dream due to poor eyesight, he ended up in university, unsure of what to study. He took courses in astronomy and mechanics, and flirted briefly with physics, botany and zoology before finally being drawn to math — geometry in particular.</p>
<p>In the late 1860s, he continued his studies, first in Germany and then in France. He was in Paris in 1870 when the Franco-Prussian War broke out. He soon tried to leave the country, but his notes on geometry, written in German, were mistaken for encoded messages, and he was arrested, accused of being a spy. He was released from prison a month later and quickly returned to math.</p>

<p>In particular, he began working with groups. Forty years earlier, the mathematician Évariste Galois had used one class of groups to <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-galois-groups-used-polynomial-symmetries-to-reshape-math-20210803/">understand the solutions to polynomial equations</a>. Lie now wanted to do the same thing for so-called differential equations, which are used to model how a physical system changes over time.</p>
<p>His vision for differential equations didn’t work out as he’d hoped. But he soon realized that the groups he was studying were interesting in their own right. And so the Lie group was born.</p>
<p>The manifold nature of Lie groups has been an enormous boon to mathematicians. When they sit down to understand a Lie group, they can use all the tools of geometry and calculus — something that’s not necessarily true for other kinds of groups. That’s because <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-is-a-manifold-20251103/">every manifold has a nice property</a>: If you zoom in on a small enough region, its curves disappear, just as the spherical Earth appears flat to those of us walking on its surface.</p>
<p>To see why this is useful for studying groups, let’s go back to SO(2). Remember that SO(2) consists of all the rotations of a Frisbee, and that those rotations can be represented as points on a circle. For now, let’s focus on a sliver of the circle corresponding to very small rotations — say, rotations of less than 1 degree.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Lie_Groups-Fig2-crMarkBelan-Desktopv1.svg" alt="" decoding="async"><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Lie_Groups-Fig2-crMarkBelan-Mobilev1.svg" alt="" decoding="async">    </p>
    </figure>

<p>Here, the curve of SO(2) is barely perceptible. When a Frisbee rotates 1 degree or less, any given point on its rim follows a nearly linear path. That means mathematicians can approximate these rotations with a straight line that touches the circle at just one point — a tangent line. This tangent line is called the Lie algebra.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Lie_Groups-Fig3-crMarkBelan-Desktopv2.svg" alt="" decoding="async"><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Lie_Groups-Fig3-crMarkBelan-Mobilev2.svg" alt="" decoding="async">    </p>
    </figure>

<p>This feature is immensely useful. Math is a lot easier on a straight line than on a curve. And the Lie algebra contains elements of its own (often visualized as arrows called vectors) that mathematicians can use to simplify their calculations about the original group. “One of the easiest kinds of mathematics in the world is linear algebra, and the theory of Lie groups is designed in such a way that it just makes constant use of linear algebra,” said <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~dav/">David Vogan</a> of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>Say you want to compare two different groups. Their respective Lie algebras simplify their key properties, Vogan said, making this task much more straightforward.</p>
<p>“The interaction between these two structures,” <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~iozzi/">Alessandra Iozzi</a>, a mathematician at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, said of Lie groups and their algebras, “is something that has an absolutely enormous array of consequences.”</p>
<h2><strong>The Language of Nature</strong></h2>
<p>The natural world is full of the kinds of continuous symmetries that Lie groups capture, making them indispensable in physics. Take gravity. The sun’s gravitational pull on the Earth depends only on the distance between them — it doesn’t matter which side of the sun the Earth is on, for instance. In the language of Lie groups, then, gravity is “symmetric under SO(3).” It remains unchanged when the system it’s acting on rotates in three-dimensional space.</p>
<p>In fact, all the fundamental forces in physics — gravity, electromagnetism, and the forces that hold together atomic nuclei — are defined by Lie group symmetries. Using that definition, scientists can <a href="https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~hooft101/lectures/lieg07.pdf">explain basic puzzles about matter</a>, like why protons are always paired with neutrons, and why the energy of an atom comes in discrete quantities.</p>
        
        
<p>In 1918, Emmy Noether <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01989">stunned mathematicians and physicists</a> by proving that Lie groups also underlie some of the <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-noethers-theorem-revolutionized-physics-20250207/">most basic laws of conservation</a> in physics. She showed that for any symmetry in a physical system that can be described by a Lie group, there is a corresponding conservation law. For instance, the fact that the laws of physics are the same today as they were yesterday and will be tomorrow — a symmetry known as time translation symmetry, represented by the Lie group consisting of the real numbers — implies that the universe’s energy must be conserved, and vice versa. “I think, even now, it’s a very surprising result,” Alekseev said.</p>
<p>Today, Lie groups remain a vital tool for both mathematicians and physicists. “Definitions live in mathematics because they’re powerful. Because there are a lot of interesting examples and they give you a good way to think about something,” Vogan said. “Symmetry is everywhere, and that’s what this stuff is for.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-non-profit">https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-non-profit</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46138238">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ghostty is now <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ghostty.org/docs/sponsor#relationship-to-hack-club">fiscally sponsored</a> by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hackclub.com/">Hack Club</a>, a
registered 501(c)(3) non-profit.</p>
<p>Fiscal sponsorship is a legal and financial
arrangement in which a recognized non-profit extends its tax-exempt status to
a project that aligns with its mission. This allows Ghostty to operate as a
charitable initiative while Hack Club manages compliance, donations,
accounting, and governance oversight.</p>
<p>Being non-profit clearly demonstrates our commitment to keeping Ghostty
free and open source for everyone. It paves the way for a model for sustainable
development beyond my personal involvement. And it also provides important
legal protections and assurances to the people and communities that adopt and
use Ghostty.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-a-non-profit">Why a Non-Profit?</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of the project in 2023 and the private beta days of
Ghostty, I've repeatedly expressed my intention that Ghostty legally
become a non-profit. This intention stems from several core beliefs I have.</p>
<p>First, I want to lay bricks for a sustainable future for Ghostty that
doesn't depend on my personal involvement technically or financially.
Financially, I am still the largest donor to the project, and I intend to
remain so, but a non-profit structure allows others to contribute financially
without fear of misappropriation or misuse of funds (as protected by legal
requirements and oversight from the fiscal sponsor).</p>
<p>Second, I want to squelch any possible concerns about a
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_scam">"rug pull"</a>.
A non-profit structure provides enforceable assurances: the mission cannot be
quietly changed, funds cannot be diverted to private benefit, and the project
cannot be sold off or repurposed for commercial gain. The structure legally
binds Ghostty to the public-benefit purpose it was created to serve.</p>
<p>Finally, despite being decades-old technology, terminals and terminal-related
technologies remain foundational to modern computing and software
infrastructure. They're often out of the limelight, but they're ever present
on developer machines, embedded in IDEs, visible as read-only consoles for
continuous integration and cloud services, and still one of the primary ways
remote access is done on servers around the world.</p>
<p><strong>I believe infrastructure of this kind should be stewarded by a mission-driven,
non-commercial entity that prioritizes public benefit over private profit.</strong>
That structure increases trust, encourages adoption, and creates the
conditions for Ghostty to grow into a widely used and impactful piece of
open-source infrastructure.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-this-means-for-ghostty">What This Means For Ghostty</h2>
<p>From a technical perspective, nothing changes for Ghostty. Our technical
goals for the project remain the same, the license (MIT) remains the same, and
we continue our work towards better Ghostty GUI releases and
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/libghostty-is-coming">libghostty</a>.</p>
<p>Financially, Ghostty can now <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://donate.ghostty.org/">accept tax-deductible donations</a> in the United
States. This opens up new avenues for funding the project and sustaining
development over the long term. Most immediately, I'm excited to begin
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ghostty.org/docs/sponsor#contributor-compensation">compensating contributors</a>,
but I also intend to support upstream dependencies, fund community events,
and pay for boring operational costs.</p>
<p>All our financial transactions will be transparent down to individual
transactions for both inflows and outflows. You can view our public
ledger at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hcb.hackclub.com/ghostty">Ghostty's page on Hack Club Bank</a>.
At the time of writing, this is empty, but you'll soon see some initial
funding from me and the beginning of paying for some of our operational
costs.</p>
<p>All applicable names, marks, and intellectual property associated with Ghostty have
been transferred to Hack Club and are now owned under the non-profit
umbrella. Copyright continues to be held by individual contributors under
the continued and existing license structure.</p>
<p>From a leadership perspective, I remain the project lead and final authority
on all decisions, but as stated earlier, the creation of a non-profit structure
lays the groundwork for an eventual future beyond this model.</p>

<h2 id="supporting-hack-club">Supporting Hack Club</h2>
<p>As our fiscal sponsor, Hack Club provides essential services to Ghostty,
including accounting, legal compliance, and governance oversight. To support
this, 7% of all donations to Ghostty go to Hack Club to cover these costs
in addition to supporting their broader mission of empowering young people
around the world interested in technology and coding.</p>
<p>In the words of Zach Latta, Hack Club's founder and executive director
this is a "good-for-good" trade. Instead of donor fees going to a for-profit
management company or covering pure overhead of a single project, the fees
go to another non-profit doing important work in the tech community and
the overhead is amortized across many projects.</p>
<p>In addition to the 7% fees, <strong>my family is personally donating $150,000
directly to the Hack Club project</strong><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> (not to Ghostty within it). Hack Club
does amazing work and I would've supported them regardless of their
fiscal sponsorship of Ghostty, but I wanted to pair these two things
together to amplify the impact of both.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="donate">Donate</h2>
<p>Please consider donating to support Ghostty's continued development.</p>
<p>I recognize that Ghostty is already in an abnormally fortunate position
to have myself as a backer, but I do envision a future where Ghostty is
more equally supported by a broader community. And with our new structure,
you can be assured about the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ghostty.org/docs/sponsor#usage-of-funds">usage of your funds</a>

<p>This post isn't meant to directly be a <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/advice-for-tech-nonprofits">fundraising pitch</a>

A Phind mini-app appears as a beautiful, interactive webpage — with images, charts, diagrams, maps, and other widgets. Phind 3 doesn’t just present information more beautifully; interacting with these widgets dynamically updates the content on the page and enables new functionality that wasn’t possible before.</p><p>For example, asking Phind for “options for a one-bedroom apartment in the Lower East Side” (<a href="https://www.phind.com/search/find-me-options-for-a-72e019ce-9524-4611-82d8-9f556d30cac2">https://www.phind.com/search/find-me-options-for-a-72e019ce-...</a>) gives an interactive apartment-finding experience with customizable filters and a map view. And asking for a “recipe for bone-in chicken thighs” gives you a customizable recipe where changing the seasoning, cooking method, and other parameters will update the recipe content itself in real-time (<a href="https://www.phind.com/search/make-me-an-recipe-for-7c30ea6c-7395-41b7-ad75-7b6a5a3981f9">https://www.phind.com/search/make-me-an-recipe-for-7c30ea6c-...</a>).</p><p>Unlike Phind 2 and ChatGPT apps, which use pre-built brittle widgets that can’t truly adapt to your task, Phind 3 is able to create tools and widgets for itself in real-time. We learned this lesson the hard way with our previous launch – the pre-built widgets made the answers much prettier, but they didn’t fundamentally enable new functionality. For example, asking for “Give me round-trip flight options from JFK to SEA on Delta from December 1st-5th in both miles and cash” (<a href="https://www.phind.com/search/give-me-round-trip-flight-c0ebe523-5ded-4038-9f68-4c6653871614">https://www.phind.com/search/give-me-round-trip-flight-c0ebe...</a>) is not something that neither Phind 2 nor ChatGPT apps can handle, because its Expedia widget can only display cash fares and not those with points. We realized that Phind needs to be able to create and consume its own tools, with schema it designs, all in real time. Phind 3’s ability to design and create fully custom widgets in real-time means that it can answer these questions while these other tools can’t. Phind 3 now generates raw React code and is able to create any tool to harness its underlying AI answer, search, and code execution capabilities.</p><p>Building on our history of helping developers solve complex technical questions, Phind 3 is able to answer and visualize developers’ questions like never before. For example, asking to “visualize quicksort” (<a href="https://www.phind.com/search/make-me-a-beautiful-visualization-ee7a7f4a-0606-4250-bdfc-08be51c76e1a">https://www.phind.com/search/make-me-a-beautiful-visualizati...</a>) gives an interactive step-by-step walkthrough of how the algorithm works.</p><p>Phind 3 can help visualize and bring your ideas to life in seconds — you can ask it to “make me a 3D Minecraft simulation” (<a href="https://www.phind.com/search/make-me-a-3d-minecraft-fde7033f-8846-446c-9e27-6c50c19358b3">https://www.phind.com/search/make-me-a-3d-minecraft-fde7033f...</a>) or “make me a 3D roller coaster simulation” (<a href="https://www.phind.com/search/make-me-a-3d-roller-472647fc-e475-4e11-80d6-2c0c1a951995">https://www.phind.com/search/make-me-a-3d-roller-472647fc-e4...</a>).</p><p>Our goal with Phind 3 is to usher in the era of on-demand software. You shouldn’t have to compromise by either settling for text-based AI conversations or using pre-built webpages that weren’t customized for you. With Phind 3, we create a “personal internet” for you with the visualization and interactivity of the internet combined with the customization possible with AI. We think that this current “chat” era of AI is akin to the era of text-only interfaces in computers. The Mac ushering in the GUI in 1984 didn’t just make computer outputs prettier — it ushered in a whole new era of interactivity and possibilities. We aim to do that now with AI.</p><p>On a technical level, we are particularly excited about:</p><p>- Phind 3’s ability to create its own tools with its own custom schema and then consume them</p><p>- Significant improvements in agentic searching and a new deep research mode to surface hard-to-access information</p><p>- All-new custom Phind models that blend speed and quality. The new Phind Fast model is based on GLM-4.5-Air while the new Phind Large model is based on GLM 4.6. Both models are state-of-the-art when it comes to reliable code generation, producing over 70% fewer errors than GPT-5.1-Codex (high) on our internal mini-app generation benchmark. Furthermore, we trained custom Eagle3 heads for both Phind Fast and Phind Large for fast inference. Phind Fast runs at up to 300 tokens per second, and Phind Large runs at up to 200 tokens per second, making them the fastest Phind models ever.</p><p>While we have done Show HNs before for previous Phind versions, we’ve never actually done a proper Launch HN for Phind. As always, we can’t wait to hear your feedback! We are also hiring, so please don’t hesitate to reach out.</p><p>– Michael</p></div></td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr></tbody></table><br>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Update: This post received a large amount of attention on Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46137514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">— see the discussion thread</a>.</p>

<p><em>Timeline &amp; Responsible Disclosure</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Initial Contact:</strong> Upon discovering this vulnerability on <strong>October 27, 2025</strong>, I immediately reached out to Filevine’s security team via email.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>November 4, 2025:</strong> Filevine’s security team thanked me for the writeup and confirmed they would review the vulnerability and fix it quickly.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>November 20, 2025:</strong> I followed up to confirm the patch was in place from my end, and informed them of my intention to write a technical blog post.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>November 21, 2025:</strong> Filevine confirmed the issue was resolved and thanked me for responsibly reporting it.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Publication:</strong> December 3, 2025.</em></p>

<p><em>The Filevine team was responsive, professional, and took the findings seriously throughout the disclosure process. They acknowledged the severity, worked to remediate the issues, allowed responsible disclosure, and maintained clear communication. This is another great example of how organizations should handle security disclosures.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>AI legal-tech companies are exploding in value, and Filevine, now valued at <strong>over a billion dollars</strong>, is one of the fastest-growing platforms in the space. Law firms feed tools like this enormous amounts of <strong>highly confidential information</strong>.</p>

<p>Because I’d recently been working with <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2024/03/25/ais-legal-revolution">Yale Law School on a related project</a>, I decided to take a closer look at how Filevine handles data security. What I discovered should concern every legal professional using AI systems today.</p>

<p>When I first navigated to the site to see how it worked, it seemed that I needed to be part of a law firm to actually play around with the tooling, or request an official demo. However, I know that companies often have a demo environment that is open, so I used a technique called subdomain enumeration (which I had first heard about in <a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/wiz-research-uncovers-exposed-deepseek-database-leak">Gal Nagli’s article</a> last year) to see if there was a demo environment. I found something much more interesting instead.</p>

<p>I saw a subdomain called <a href="http://margolis.filevine.com/">margolis.filevine.com</a>. When I navigated to that site, I was greeted with a loading page that never resolved:</p>

<p><img src="https://alexschapiro.com/assets/images/filevine-security/loading.png" alt="Loading page screenshot placeholder"></p>

<p>I wanted to see what was actually loading, so I opened Chrome’s developer tools, but saw <strong>no Fetch/XHR requests</strong> (the request you often expect to see if a page is loading data). Then, I decided to dig through some of the Javascript files to see if I could figure out what was <em>supposed</em> to be happening. I saw a snippet in a JS file like <code>POST await fetch(${BOX_SERVICE}/recommend)</code>. This piqued my interest – recommend what? And what is the BOX_SERVICE? That variable was not defined in the JS file the fetch would be called from, but (after looking through minified code, which SUCKS to do) I found it in another one: “<a href="http://dxxxxxx9.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod">dxxxxxx9.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod</a>”. Now I had a <strong>new endpoint to test</strong>, I just had to figure out the correct payload structure to it. After looking at more minified js to determine the correct structure for this endpoint, I was able to construct a working payload to /prod/recommend:</p>

<div><pre><code>{"projectName":"Very sensitive Project"}
</code></pre></div>

<p>(the name could be anything of course). <strong>No authorization tokens needed</strong>, and I was greeted with the response:</p>

<p><img src="https://alexschapiro.com/assets/images/filevine-security/response.png" alt="Response screenshot placeholder"></p>

<p>At first I didn’t entirely understand the impact of what I saw. No matter the name of the project I passed in, I was recommended the same boxFolders and couldn’t seem to access any files. Then, not realizing I stumbled upon something <strong>massive</strong>, I turned my attention to the <code>boxToken</code> in the response.</p>

<p>After reading some documentation on the Box Api, I realized this was a <strong>maximum access fully scoped admin token</strong> to the <strong>entire Box filesystem</strong> (like an internal shared Google Drive) of this law firm. This includes <strong>all confidential files, logs, user information, etc.</strong> Once I was able to prove this had an impact (by searching for “confidential” and getting <strong>nearly 100k results</strong> back)</p>

<p><img src="https://alexschapiro.com/assets/images/filevine-security/search-results.png" alt="Search results placeholder"></p>

<p>I <strong>immediately stopped testing</strong> and responsibly disclosed this to Filevine. They responded quickly and professionally and remediated this issue.</p>

<p>If someone had malicious intent, they would have been able to extract <strong>every single file</strong> used by Margolis lawyers – countless data protected by <strong>HIPAA</strong> and other legal standards, internal memos/payrolls, literally <strong>millions of the most sensitive documents</strong> this law firm has in their possession. <strong>Documents protected by court orders!</strong> This could have been a real nightmare for both the law firm and the clients whose data would have been exposed.</p>

<p>To companies who feel pressure to rush into the AI craze in their industry – <strong>be careful!</strong> Always ensure the companies you are giving your most sensitive information to <strong>secure that data</strong>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>For over a decade, Steam company Valve’s biggest goal has been bringing Windows games to Linux. While that goal is almost complete with the massive success of Proton compatibility on Steam Deck and <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/news/valve-says-its-upcoming-steam-machine-will-be-priced-like-a-pc-not-like-a-console/">the upcoming Steam Machine</a>, the company has also been secretly pushing to bring Windows games to ARM devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/820656/valve-interview-arm-gaming-steamos-pierre-loup-griffais">The Verge</a>, Steam Deck and SteamOS lead Pierre-Loup Griffais revealed that Valve has been secretly funding Fex, an open-source project to bring Windows games to ARM, for almost a decade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In 2016, 2017, there was always an idea we would end up wanting to do that,” the SteamOS lead said, and that’s when the Fex compatibility layer was started, because we knew there was close to a decade of work needed before it would be robust enough people could rely on it for their libraries. There’s a lot of work that went into that.”</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“We’re pretty excited to be able to expand PC gaming to include all those options”</p><cite>Pierre-Loup Griffais on Valve’s funding of ARM compatibility layers</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Griffais explained that the project pushes to “reduce barriers for users not having to worry about what games run”. With Windows games running on ARM, a large number of Steam games are able to run on a significant number of additional devices including low-power laptops, tablets and even phones (hopefully) without issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Griffais didn’t confirm specific devices that Valve is working on, the SteamOS lead explained that they’re “excited” about creating potential ARM-based devices.&nbsp;“I think that it paves the way for a bunch of different, maybe ultraportables, maybe more powerful laptops being ARM-based and using different offerings in that segment,” he said. “Handhelds, there’s a lot of potential for ARM, of course, and one might see desktop chips as well at some point in the ARM world.”</p>



<p>But why ARM? The Steam Deck lead explained that the hardware offers more efficiency at lower power compared to other options. While the current hardware in the Steam Deck and other handhelds can run at low-wattage, they’re simply less efficient at lower-power than hardware designed specifically to run at that spec.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s a lot of price points and power consumption points where Arm-based chipsets are doing a better job of serving the market,” they said.&nbsp; “When you get into lower power, anything lower than Steam Deck, I think you’ll find that there’s an ARM chip that maybe is competitive with x86 offerings in that segment.”</p>



<p>“We’re pretty excited to be able to expand PC gaming to include all those options instead of being arbitrarily restricted to a subset of the market,” they continued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Valve is currently working on an ARM version of SteamOS using “the same exact OS components, the same exact Arch Linux base, all the same updater, all the same technologies,” Griffais said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When&nbsp; you’re looking at SteamOS on Arm, you’re really looking at the same thing,” he continued. “Instead of downloading the normal Proton that’s built for x86 and targets x86 games, it will also be able to download a Proton that’s Arm-aware, that has a bulk of its code compiled for Arm and can also include the Fex emulator.”</p>



<p>All of this is to give players a choice. While Windows games are built for Windows, they don’t necessarily need to be played on Windows. Valve has already proven how effective this can be with some games Windows running via Proton performing better due to the lack of Windows bloat.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Steam Hardware Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OmKrKTwtukE?start=7&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Nevertheless, there are issues. Some games have compatibility problems out of the box, and modern multiplayer games with anti-cheat simply do not work through a translation layer, <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/news/valve-says-steam-machine-success-will-help-to-push-devs-to-properly-support-anti-cheat-on-linux/">something Valve hopes will change in the future</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s all fantastic work though, and it gives players a chance to break away from Windows without losing much, if anything, when shifting ecosystems. For decades, Windows has dominated the PC space, and it likely still will for a long while, but now there’s actually space for alternatives to grow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve already seen massive adoption of SteamOS via the Steam Deck, but with <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/steamos-alternative-bazzite-smashes-records-to-deliver-over-a-petabyte-of-isos-in-just-one-month/">Bazzite now shifting petabytes of ISOs every month</a>, there’s definitely an urge to move away from Windows, at least on the handheld side.&nbsp;</p>

Assigned CVE-2025-55182 (React) and CVE-2025-66478 (Next.js), this flaw allows for unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) on the server due to insecure deserialization. The vulnerability exists in the default configuration of affected applications, meaning standard deployments are immediately at risk. Due to the high severity and the ease of exploitation, immediate patching is required.</p><p>To maintain ecosystem safety while patches are applied, we are currently withholding specific details; the details provided here are intended solely to assist defenders in prioritizing remediation and understanding the risk. We will be updating this blog with additional information as it comes to light.</p><h2><a id="what-are-cve-2025-55182-and-cve-2025-66478-6"></a><strong>What are CVE-2025-55182 and CVE-2025-66478?</strong></h2><p><strong>CVE-2025-55182</strong> is a critical unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the <code>react-server</code> package used by React Server Components (RSC).</p><p><strong>CVE-2025-66478</strong> is the corresponding RCE vulnerability in Next.js, which inherits the same underlying flaw through its implementation of the RSC “Flight” protocol.</p><p>The vulnerability fundamentally resides in the react-server package and its handling of the RSC "Flight" protocol. It is characterized as a logical deserialization vulnerability where the server processes RSC payloads in an unsafe manner. When a server receives a specially crafted, malformed payload, it fails to validate the structure correctly. This allows attacker-controlled data to influence server-side execution logic, resulting in the execution of privileged JavaScript code.</p><p>In our experimentation, exploitation of this vulnerability had high fidelity, with a near 100% success rate and can be leveraged to a full remote code execution. The attack vector is unauthenticated and remote, requiring only a specially crafted HTTP request to the target server. It affects the default configuration of popular frameworks.</p><h2><a id="wiz-research-data-whats-the-risk-to-cloud-environments-11"></a><strong>Wiz Research data: what’s the risk to cloud environments?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>According to Wiz data, 39% of cloud environments have instances vulnerable to CVE-2025-55182 and/or CVE-2025-66478.</p><h2><a id="which-products-are-affected-13"></a><strong>Which products are affected?</strong></h2><div><table><thead><tr><th>Vulnerable product</th><th>Patched release</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span>React: 19.0, 19.1, 19.2</span></td><td><span>19.0.1, 19.1.2, and 19.2.1</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Next.js: 14.3.0-canary, 15.x,   and 16.x (App Router)</span></td><td><span> 14.3.0-canary.88, 15.0.5, 15.1.9, 15.2.6, 15.3.6,   15.4.8, 15.5.7, 16.0.7</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Any framework or library bundling the react-server implementation is likely affected.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
        

<article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I am working on an isometric game inspired from Gnomoria, RimWorld, Dwarf Fortress, etc. It uses my own simple engine (with rust and wgpu-rs). Whenever I started my game, my headphones were buzzing. I could play Fortnite, Overwatch or any other game and that doesn’t cause my headphones to buzz. It’s only my game.</p>

<p><img src="https://alexene.dev/images/headphones_buzz/game_screenshot.png" alt="game"></p>

<p>And it’s really annoying, as you might imagine.</p>

<p>Why can I play Overwatch and Fortnite fine, while my isometric game makes my headset buzz?
I had a fairly decent CPU, a 3090RTX card, 32GB RAM and <strong>USB audio</strong> through a MODI 2 DAC.
Nothing out of this world, but nothing too bad. One important detail here is that the power to the MODI device comes from an USB port in my computer. This was the first clue, I tried other ports with no change in results (headphones still buzzed).</p>

<p>Initially, I started to think it’s some sort of power-use related issue, because maybe my PSU was getting old, or had daemons in it. However, I still couldn’t explain why my tiny game was causing more chaos than say big games that send significantly more work at my PC.</p>

<p>I noticed is that when it didn’t render anything, nothing buzzed (I run tests with rendering disabled). So that eliminated any sort of CPU work causing it. Let’s take a look at what the GPU does.</p>

<h2 id="the-pipeline">The pipeline</h2>

<p>The game has a simple graphics pipeline. I use WebGPU (more precisely wgpu-rs) and do some compute work to select visible entities, then use draw indirect to draw those entities. In the end, my render pipeline also outputs two things: the buffer that ends up on screen and a “picking texture”.
<img src="https://alexene.dev/images/headphones_buzz/diagram.png" alt="pipeline"></p>

<p>A picking texture is a very simple idea. As the name says, it’s used to handle picking in the game, when you click somewhere on the screen (e.g. to select an unit), I use this texture to know what you clicked on. Instead of colors, every object instance writes their EntityID to this texture. Then, when you click the mouse, you check what id is in the pixel under the mouse position.</p>

<p>At the end of a frame, I copy that picking texture back to RAM (from GPU memory), to check it against mouse positions in case of a click.</p>

<p>This isn’t ideal as transfers from GPU-&gt;CPU memory take time, but it works and is way simpler to implement and debug than casting a ray through the scene:
<img src="https://alexene.dev/images/headphones_buzz/unoptimized.png" alt="capture"></p>

<h2 id="so-why-does-rendering-make-my-headphones-buzz">So why does rendering make my headphones buzz?</h2>

<p>Now that we have a picture of how the rendering in my game works, time to debug it. We know it’s something to do with the GPU work, but what can possibly cause this? As the trace above shows, my GPU is not under heavy load.</p>

<p>As I was stuck and had no idea on what can be a likely issue, I proceeded to then disable parts of my rendering pipeline (first the compute, then the rendering, then transferring the picking texture). When I skipped downloading the picking texture the buzzing was fully gone. What was confusing in this process is that disabling parts of the pipeline, somehow made the buzzing a lower volume and less noticeable.</p>

<p>To be sure it was the picking texture download, I also issued the download every 250ms and noticed the noise is almost gone. Increasing the frequency on how often we download it to RAM, increased the buzzing.</p>

<p>So at this point I had a likely source, but no idea why things would interfere in ways to what I assumed was the power to my MODI device. Through a bunch of discussion with other graphics engineers, someone suggested it may be due to the fact that I full on hit the GPU with tons of work, then pause the GPU to wait for that picking texture to transfer, then turn it back on 100% for the next frame.</p>

<p>That explanation is plausible and also likely as I further on proceeded to supply power to my MODI device from another source that’s not my PC and the buzzing was gone.</p>

<p>Now that we know this, all was left is to fix it. In hindsight, the solution is obvious. There’s no need to download the whole texture each frame, just the part of the picking texture that’s under the mouse. So I implemented that and it worked and buzzing is gone. As a bonus, now it’s also not visible at all on the GPU trace.</p>

Like Dr. Frankenstein, we assembled it piece by piece - Medicare for the elderly, insurance through jobs, Medicaid for the poor, exchanges for everyone else. Each piece solved a specific problem. Each addition made sense in isolation.</p><p>Put them together and you get something alive. Something vast. Something no one would have designed from scratch - because we never agreed on what we were designing.</p><p>The flows in the diagram represent $4.9 Trillion - but they also trace every medical decision made in America last year. Every dose administered and every diagnosis delivered. Every ambulance ride and every rehabilitation. Every birth and every final goodbye.</p><p>The flows are the aggregate infrastructure of how we keep people alive and healthy - and also, the accumulated friction that makes it harder to stay that way.</p><p>This chart holds the confused senior on dialysis, lost between three different insurances. The branch has a brilliant researcher, waiting for approval to start her life-saving trial. Lost in the flow is a desperate parent calling six numbers to pray for one “in-network” specialist. The ends show a struggling hospital with a whole floor for billing - and a closet for social work.</p><p><span>Every flow in the diagram is someone’s life intersecting with the creature we created. </span><strong>And every flow is also a choice about obligation.</strong><span> </span><em>Who do we owe care to? What do we owe and how much?</em></p><p><span>The question that comes up for this creation: </span><em>What did we build and why?</em></p><p>Other wealthy nations finance healthcare too. They also have to balance costs, quality, and access. They also have powerful stakeholders fighting over money and control. But their diagrams don’t look like ours. To understand what we built - and why - we need to see what a coherent system looks like first.</p><p><span>Look, I’m not an international healthcare policy expert. But I went down a research rabbit hole reading </span><em>Which Country Has the World’s Best Health Care?</em><span> by Ezekiel Emanuel (my favorite of the legendary </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2013/03/24/174735421/love-roughhousing-and-fifth-position-in-brothers-emanuel" rel="">Emanuel brothers</a><span>), and made some diagrams to understand what other countries actually built.</span></p><p>Not to propose we copy them - that ship sailed decades ago. But to see what it looks like when a country chooses a philosophy and then builds the body. Two examples: the UK’s Beveridge model (named after Lord Beveridge, not a beverage model from tacky 90s beer commercials), and Germany’s Bismarck model.</p><p>The obvious place to start is the UK’s NHS - the prime example of a single-payer health system. But before we get to how it works, we need to understand the choice that made it possible.</p><p>Lord Beveridge published his report in 1942, in the middle of World War II. Britain was being bombed nightly. Citizens were already sacrificing everything for collective survival. And Beveridge asked: if we’re asking people to die for each other, shouldn’t we also keep each other alive? Healthcare as a right, funded through taxes, free at point of service - a popular position around moral framing. Shortly after the war, the National Health Service launched in 1948 to match it.</p><p>Of the £317 billion ($400B USD) of UK healthcare spend, 81% comes from general taxation - one payer for nearly everything. NHS England handles most services directly.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fvcI!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4d6d289-359b-4258-a02a-2158c42ad323_1280x1600.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fvcI!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4d6d289-359b-4258-a02a-2158c42ad323_1280x1600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fvcI!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4d6d289-359b-4258-a02a-2158c42ad323_1280x1600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fvcI!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4d6d289-359b-4258-a02a-2158c42ad323_1280x1600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fvcI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4d6d289-359b-4258-a02a-2158c42ad323_1280x1600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fvcI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4d6d289-359b-4258-a02a-2158c42ad323_1280x1600.png" width="1280" height="1600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f4d6d289-359b-4258-a02a-2158c42ad323_1280x1600.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1600,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fvcI!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4d6d289-359b-4258-a02a-2158c42ad323_1280x1600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fvcI!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4d6d289-359b-4258-a02a-2158c42ad323_1280x1600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fvcI!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4d6d289-359b-4258-a02a-2158c42ad323_1280x1600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fvcI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4d6d289-359b-4258-a02a-2158c42ad323_1280x1600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Social care (orange in the graph) - like long-term care - are separately managed through local authorities, which creates some coordination gaps. Private insurance is a paltry spend in comparison - Americans would call this “concierge medicine”. Brits call it “queue jumping”, which should tell you everything about their cultural relationship to fairness and waiting your turn.</p><p>Look at what disappears in the UK diagram: no insurance cards to verify, no network checks, no surprise bills, no prior authorization departments. Admin costs are low with only one payer, there’s no one to negotiate with and no one to bill.</p><p>The complexity that Americans assume is inevitable is actually optional - once you decide who owes what to whom.</p><p><span>UK’s system has its problems</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-175943797" href="https://healthisotherpeople.substack.com/p/an-abominable-creature#footnote-1-175943797" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> - wait times, capacity strains - but Brits LOVE it anyway. The opening ceremony for the 2012 London Olympics </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/TeamGB/videos/nhs-london-2012-opening-ceremony/866538467154251/" rel="">celebrated the NHS</a><span> with doctors, nurses, and (hopefully) fake sick children dancing on hospital beds. While dancing over a government agency may seem silly, they’re actually celebrating their shared moral commitment to each other.</span></p><p>Could America make this choice? Technically, yes. Politically, we’d need to agree that healthcare is a right we owe each other, funded collectively through taxes. That would mean massive tax increases, eliminating private insurance as the primary system, and trusting a single federal agency.</p><p>The operational resistance alone would be too much: I’ve watched hospital execs squeeze out thinning margins and payer executives navigate quarterly earnings calls. We’re talking about unwinding a $1T+ private insurance industry, reconfiguring every hospital’s revenue model, and convincing Americans to trust the federal government with something they currently (sort of) get through their jobs. That ship didn’t just sail - it sank decades ago.</p><p>The UK made one healthcare body in 1948, but was it too simple - or is it elegantly simple? We can compare it with something much more complex, like the Bismarck model.</p><p>Germany has roughly 140 competing insurance companies - in stark contrast to one payer of the UK. Yet Germany delivers universal coverage for over half of what the US spends per person.</p><p><span>Unifier of Germany, Otto von Bismarck (not named after </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biz_Markie" rel="">who I initially thought</a><span>) didn’t create this because he loved workers. He created it because socialists were gaining power in the 1880s and he needed to steal their thunder. “Give workers healthcare before they overthrow us” is peak </span><em>realpolitik</em><span> (the German word for “do what works, not what feels righteous”).</span></p><p><span>Americans are told you must choose: government control OR market competition.

Long-term care operates as a separate system (that orange flow on the diagram) instead of bankrupting families or clogging hospitals. Earn over €73,800 ($85K USD) and you can opt into private insurance (in purple).</p><p>Germany has universal coverage through competition and cost control through regulation. There are four distinct paths: statutory (blue), private (purple), long-term care (orange), and out-of-pocket (yellow). In practice, there is a lot of complexity, but structured towards the theory of social insurance.</p><p><span>But the German system has trade-offs</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-175943797" href="https://healthisotherpeople.substack.com/p/an-abominable-creature#footnote-2-175943797" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span>: payroll tax is pressure on employers, the inequality between public and private tiers, and 140 bureaucracies to navigate. But the complexity serves a coherent purpose.</span></p><p>But imagine if American insurers competed on “who has the best nurse hotline” instead of “who can design the narrowest network to avoid costs”. That’s what happens when the obligation to cover everyone is non-negotiable.</p><p>Americans might actually like health insurers functioning as utilities, not profit-maximizing businesses. But federal price-setting across 50 states means telling every hospital and physician what they can charge - and CMS already struggles with Medicare rates alone.</p><p>The lobbying alone would be apocalyptic. While insurers would fight “utility” status, the hospitals would fight price controls. Not to mention that the entire physician payment model would need restructuring, while we’re in the midst of an upcoming clinician shortage.</p><p><span>But fundamentally, Americans would need to agree: your job connects you to a community of mutual obligation. Do we actually believe that? We built something like it through </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK235989/" rel="">a historical accident</a><span> (WW2 wage controls), but we’ve never committed to the moral premise.</span></p><p>Germany chose regulated competition in 1883 and built something complex - but the parts were designed to work together.

But like all other self-centered Americans, my focus is on talking about the US Healthcare System.</span></p><p>We can learn a lot from two distinct namesake models: the Bismarck model is “social insurance” and the Beveridge model is a “universal right”. The UK and Germany made different choices and built different systems: the UK moves money from taxpayers → NHS → services, Germany from employers + employees → sickness funds → services. But both embody their stated values.</p><p>So what does the US value? We built something that costs everyone, everything, everywhere - and still leaves 27 million uninsured.</p><p><span>The outcome is $4.9T - which would make it the 3rd largest economy in the world, a high 8% admin costs - compared to the UK’s 2% admin, with medical bankruptcy still possible. </span><strong>We’ve never agreed on what we value</strong><span>. So we built a system that embodies our disagreement: employer-based coverage (market choice) plus Medicare (social insurance) plus Medicaid (safety net) plus exchanges (regulated markets).</span></p><p>Maybe that IS the American philosophy: pluralism so deep we can’t even agree on how to keep each other alive.</p><p><span>My fear with the diagram is that it just becomes gratuitous complication-porn. I’m not trying to show something to get the reaction of, “</span><em>Wow, what a tangled mess! Isn’t that insightful?</em><span>” Let’s look more closely to see the nuance and significance of we can take away from this chart.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uo91!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F199ce5c1-dc96-43af-b3ac-b6bb1a3063f8_1600x1334.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uo91!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F199ce5c1-dc96-43af-b3ac-b6bb1a3063f8_1600x1334.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uo91!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F199ce5c1-dc96-43af-b3ac-b6bb1a3063f8_1600x1334.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uo91!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F199ce5c1-dc96-43af-b3ac-b6bb1a3063f8_1600x1334.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uo91!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F199ce5c1-dc96-43af-b3ac-b6bb1a3063f8_1600x1334.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uo91!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F199ce5c1-dc96-43af-b3ac-b6bb1a3063f8_1600x1334.png" width="728" height="607" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/199ce5c1-dc96-43af-b3ac-b6bb1a3063f8_1600x1334.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1214,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:728,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uo91!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F199ce5c1-dc96-43af-b3ac-b6bb1a3063f8_1600x1334.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uo91!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F199ce5c1-dc96-43af-b3ac-b6bb1a3063f8_1600x1334.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uo91!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F199ce5c1-dc96-43af-b3ac-b6bb1a3063f8_1600x1334.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uo91!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F199ce5c1-dc96-43af-b3ac-b6bb1a3063f8_1600x1334.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Soak in the Sankey (Tsang-key?) diagram again.

<p id="3f2549c1-b62e-4051-8cf8-752524a0ecdd">It's no surprise to see modern AAA games occupying hundreds of gigabytes of storage these days, especially if you are gaming on a PC. But somehow, Arrowhead Game Studios, the developers behind the popular co-op shooter <em>Helldivers 2</em>, have managed to substantially cut the game’s size by 85%.</p><p>As per a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371" target="_blank" data-url="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link">recent post on Steam</a>, this reduction was made possible with support from Nixxes Software, best known for developing high-quality PC ports of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/sony" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/sony">Sony</a>’s biggest PlayStation titles. The developers were able to achieve this by de-duplicating game data, which resulted in bringing the size down from ~154GB to just ~23GB, saving a massive ~131GB of storage space.</p><p id="3f2549c1-b62e-4051-8cf8-752524a0ecdd-2">Originally, the game’s large install size was attributed to optimization for mechanical hard drives since duplicating data is used to reduce loading times on older storage media. However, it turns out that Arrowhead’s estimates for load times on HDDs, based on industry data, were incorrect.</p><p>With their latest data measurements specific to the game, the developers have confirmed the small number of players (11% last week) using mechanical hard drives will witness mission load times increase by only a few seconds in worst cases. Additionally, the post reads, “the majority of the loading time in <em>Helldivers 2</em> is due to level-generation rather than asset loading. This level generation happens in parallel with loading assets from the disk and so is the main determining factor of the loading time.”</p><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" id="c9748c52-792e-4aa9-b55b-1340711c004d" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">
