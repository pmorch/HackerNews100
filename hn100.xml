                      <ul><li><b>New Study from BCG Reveals That When Employees Feel Included at Work, the Likelihood of Burnout Is Halved</b></li><li><b>Report Highlights Four Key Employee Sentiments That Have the Biggest Impact on Inclusion</b></li></ul><p><b>BOSTON—</b>At some point in their careers, most, if not all, employees around the world have likely experienced symptoms of burnout at work—a state of exhaustion characterized by disenchantment with one’s job and a sense of inefficiency. A new report released today by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) reveals that, on average, 48% of workers from eight countries indicate that they are currently grappling with burnout.</p><p>Based on a survey of 11,000 desk-based and frontline workers in eight countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, UK, and US) and titled <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/four-keys-to-boosting-inclusion-and-beating-burnout" data-path="four-keys-to-boosting-inclusion-and-beating-burnout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Four Keys to Boosting Inclusion and Beating Burnout</i></a>, the report also reveals that when employees feel included at work, burnout is halved.</p><p>Inclusion is central to building and maintaining a successful workforce. Inclusion in the workplace means that employees feel valued, respected, supported, and like they belong. Workers experiencing higher inclusion are also more likely to stay in their jobs, decreasing turnover costs for businesses.</p><p>For this research, BCG quantified inclusion as a score of how inclusive an employee finds the workplace to be, using <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/how-to-improve-inclusion-in-the-workplace" data-path="how-to-improve-inclusion-in-the-workplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BCG’s BLISS Index</a>, a statistically rigorous tool that identifies the factors that most strongly influence feelings of inclusion in the workplace.</p><p>Further, the survey revealed four sentiments that have the greatest impact on employees’ overall sense of feeling included:<br></p><ul><li>Good access to resources</li><li>Senior managerial support</li><li>Psychological safety with direct manager</li><li>Fair and equal opportunity for success</li></ul><p>These signal how much, or how little, people are experiencing inclusion in the workplace. When employees feel that these sentiments are positively addressed in their workplace, they feel <i>more</i> included and <i>less</i> burned out. Unfortunately, these most important sentiments are also the ones where survey respondents indicated the lowest levels of satisfaction.&nbsp;</p><p>And while burnout is prevalent across all employee types, it’s far higher for certain subgroups. Women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, and deskless workers experienced up to 26% higher burnout. Moreover, these employee groups reported lower inclusion than employees who were in majority groups or were desk-based.</p><p>Feeling included means many different things to many different people. It follows that building inclusion can be daunting. But focusing on these four most important sentiments gives employers a clear starting point to ask workers the right questions and focus their efforts to understand the employee experience.</p><p>“Inclusion doesn’t end at recruitment. It requires listening to workers on an ongoing basis and addressing their pain points. It must address both the employee offer and the daily experience of employees with their managers,” said Gabrielle Novacek, a managing director and partner at BCG and coauthor of the report.</p><p>“By focusing on the four key areas and diagnosing where they may be falling short in their current efforts to meet their employees’ needs, companies will be able to identify where to invest and innovate to improve feelings of inclusion and reduce burnout. Establishing programs to meet these needs will help employers avoid the costs associated with burnout, be able to attract talent, and reap the benefits of a thriving workforce.”</p><p>Download the publication <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/four-keys-to-boosting-inclusion-and-beating-burnout" data-path="four-keys-to-boosting-inclusion-and-beating-burnout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Media Contact:</b><br>Eric Gregoire--<a href="mailto:gregoire.eric@bcg.com" data-path="mailto:gregoire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gregoire.eric@bcg.com</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em>The attorney in a country town is as much a businessman as the corporation counsel in a great metropolis. - William Jennings Bryan, 1896</em></p><p>The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra, coined the term ‘junk fee,’ and has begun restructuring how financial markets work, removing medical debt from credit reports, fostering competition in credit cards, and examining big tech’s entrance into payments. And yet, for ideological reasons, to many bankers, Chopra is a villain running a government agency full of bureaucratic demons, whose goal is to force them to do paperwork on behalf of nebulous ‘consumers.’ </p><p><span>So it was a </span><a href="https://www.housingwire.com/podcast/james-kleimann-on-va-and-cfpb-news-as-well-as-credit-scores-and-freddies-proposal-for-buying-closed-end-seconds/" rel="">weird da</a><span>y last month when Chopra had a room full of mortgage bankers nodding their heads in furious agreement, and even angry at their own trade association for helping a monopoly take advantage of them. HousingWire’s James Kleimann and Sarah Wheeler were shocked, calling it “Must-See TV.” </span></p><div id="youtube2-LJxKNY1G1kQ" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;LJxKNY1G1kQ&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;1060&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LJxKNY1G1kQ?start=1060&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><span>The Mortgage Bankers Association annual conference started with the typical attack on the government, with President and CEO Bob Broeksmit complaining about ‘regulatory knots’ while decrying government crackdowns on junk fees. CFPB Directors often attend these conferences to communicate with the industry, and the conversations aren’t always pleasant. This one didn’t seem like it would be pleasant either. But Chopra went on stage a few hours later and </span><a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/prepared-remarks-of-cfpb-director-rohit-chopra-at-the-mortgage-bankers-association/" rel="">discussed</a><span> an increasing cost center for banks, which is the credit bureaus and FICO. </span></p><p>“Mortgage lenders in the U.S. increasingly face a lack of competition when it comes to accessing data and reports needed for loan origination,” he said. “In many cases, a handful of firms have cornered the market, allowing those companies to levy a tax on every mortgage application or transaction in the country.” Three firms dominate credit reporting: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. And just one company handles algorithms, the Fair Isaac Corporation, which sells the FICO score. “Mortgage lenders have shared that costs for credit reports and scores have increased,” he said. “Sometimes by 400% since 2022.” Chopra then went on to lay out some regulatory authority the CFPB has to impose price caps.</p><p><span>The audience, surprisingly for a free market capitalist loving group of lenders, was eating it up.</span><em> </em><span>Why? Well it’s the same reason app developers hate Apple and Google, or cattle ranchers dislike JBS, or producers fear Netflix. The credit bureau cartel are </span><em>gatekeepers </em><span>to their market. And they are being squeezed, increasingly </span><a href="https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/lenders-keep-losing-money-on-every-loan-produced-mba-says#:~:text=Independent%20mortgage%20bankers%20continued%20to,by%20the%20Mortgage%20Bankers%20Association." rel="">losing</a><span> money on every mortgage they issue.</span></p><p>Consumers pay for credit scoring, but they do so indirectly. When someone is thinking of buying a house, he or she visits a mortgage lender. That lender must buy a credit score from FICO and the bureaus to see what that person can afford. When a customer takes out a loan, that mortgage banker has to purchase another more complete report of credit information.  </p><p>Even if a lender thinks the customer would be a good risk, the lender has to buy a FICO score regardless. Mortgage bankers don’t carry the capital to hold the mortgages they make. Instead they make a loan, and then send it onward to the capital markets. First, the government guarantees most mortgages through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well as other programs for veterans and first time homebuyers. Then, the government in turn sends these guaranteed mortgages to Wall Street. This complex process relies on a standard to price the loans, and that standard is FICO, combined with the credit information from the three bureaus.  </p><p>Mortgage bankers aren’t typical Wall Street bankers. While mortgage lending can be done by the big guys, real estate is an inherently localized industry with a clubby network of realtors, title insurers, and various other specialists in the home-buying process, so independent players have a strong foothold. There are roughly a thousand independent mortgage lending firms nationwide, and these lenders live everywhere. So their anger at FICO and the credit bureaus has an element of regional resentment, since they are not Wall Street traders, but are local community members trying to help people get homes.</p><p><span>In January of 2024, the </span><a href="https://www.communitylender.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CHLA-Credit-Score-White-Paper-FINAL-VSN.pdf" rel="">Community Home Lenders of America</a><span> discussed this dynamic with FICO, calling it a utility, which it is. The “combination of FICO’s extremely high market share, and the fact that Washington agencies require lenders to use this company’s product, means that FICO has unilateral, solid-gold market power, the type rarely seen in any US industry short of highly regulated utilities, whereby rates are set by public-utility boards or commissions.” </span></p><p>But the companies themselves know it and say it. In November 2011, then-CEO of Fair Isaac, Mark Greene, explained that the “network effect” of “FICO Scores . . . being sort of the standard language” and “having everybody . . . standardize on a FICO Score, that’s magic.” FICO sells 10 billion scores every year, four times the number of McDonald’s burgers and twice the number of Starbucks coffees sold annually. According to the company itself, nine out of ten lending decisions rely on FICO. </p><p><span>Credit scoring used to cost a relatively small amount of money, but now it can be up to $60 per pull, with the price quadrupling over the last two years for no reason whatsoever. Only one out of every ten prospective customers ends up taking out a mortgage, so higher prices fronted by mortgage bankers add up. And it’s starting to be a major expense, driving some of the mortgage lenders out of the business entirely. In other words, Chopra, though disliked for calling out junk fees charged by bankers, was actually </span><em>attacking a junk fee that</em><span> </span><em>mortgage bankers themselves have to pay.</em></p><p>After his speech, Chopra and Broeksmit sat down for a public discussion, and Broeksmit pushed back on the criticism of FICO, which had led the price hike charge. And here’s where it got fascinating. Broeksmit was supposed to be representing the mortgage bankers in his association. But Chopra pointed out that, though it was a Mortgage Bankers Association event, the session itself was sponsored by FICO. “That was a wild moment right there,” recounted Wheeler on the HousingWire podcast. The head of the Mortgage Bankers Association, was being bribed by a monopolist to betray the bankers he was supposed to represent. And he was just called out for it.</p><p><span>To understand the roots of this fight, we have to go back to the origins of credit reporting, which extend deep into American history. For 150 years, you could simply escape your debt by moving somewhere else, and adopting an entirely new identity. That’s the premise of the iconic American novel </span><em>The Great Gatsby,</em><span> the story of a mysterious East coast tycoon who has hidden his past. Today, </span><em>The Great Gatsby </em><span>couldn’t be written. Or if it were, it would be a one page story, in which someone runs a credit check on a rich liar named Jay Gatsby. </span></p><p><span>In other words, national credit reports are foundational to modern American society, binding us to one another financially as a nation through a network of computerized records. And that national market of identity is relatively new. Until 1970, credit reporting was localized, mostly through coops of town bankers who hired detectives to investigate borrowers, collecting gossip from snitches about who drank too much, who was a Communist, who slept around, and so forth. As the book </span><em>The Naked Society </em><span>noted, bureaus looked at a consumer’s "honesty, potentially dangerous habits, and manliness." Such information was kept in large paper files, it was secret, and it could often lead to someone never being able to get a job in a certain area, and they would never know why. A Gatsby was plausible, since you could escape your debts and your very identity by leaving one state and moving to another. </span></p><p>Credit bureaus, like the FBI who collaborated with them, were creepy, with no limits on their data collection practices. And they saw themselves explicitly as disciplinarians. In 1968, leading credit bureau Retail Credit Corporation President Lee Burge told Congress that the “availability of record information imposes a discipline on the American citizen. He becomes more responsible for his performance whether as a driver of his car, as an employee in his job performance, or as a payor to his creditors. But this discipline is a necessary one if we are to enjoy the fruits of our economy and the present freedom of our private enterprise.”</p><p>After a lot of complaints, Congress acted. In 1970, the only woman on the Banking Committee, Leonor Sullivan, collaborated with Rep. Wright Patman and Senator William Proxmire to write and pass the Fair Credit Reporting Act. This law eliminated the collection of the gossip, which often included information on race, gender, and sexuality. FCRA gave consumers a set of rights over their credit reporting files even though these files were held by private firms, and set limits on what data could be collected and how it could be used. No longer was it acceptable to take someone’s sex life and put it in a secret file, with that information leading to the inability to get a job for years. The new law treated the credit reporting bureaus as public utilities. </p><p>FCRA was in a sense the last of the New Deal legal arrangements, passed at a moment of immense suspicion over government surveillance, part of a set of rules limiting the use of personal information by the Federal government and corporations. But FCRA also structured the national credit market, fostering the computerization of credit information nationwide, and designed to regulate the emerging industry of credit cards, which had picked up steam during the 1960s. “When a man walks into a bank to get a loan,” said a Bank of America executive in Congressional testimony, “he gives up a certain amount of privacy.” Now the bank’s ability to invade his privacy would be regulated and standardized, with the result that a loan could be done in a national market. The Gatsby era ended.</p><p><span>There were </span><a href="https://www.communitylender.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CHLA-Credit-Score-White-Paper-FINAL-VSN.pdf" rel="">two thousand credit</a><span> bureaus across the U.S. when FCRA passed. By the 1990s, due to this law and to a relaxation of antitrust, they </span><a href="https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/consumer-finance/discussion-papers/creditreportinghistory_062002.pdf" rel="">consolidated</a><span> into three main firms, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. These bureaus take advantage and encourage network effects to exclude rivals. They use a “give-to-get” rule, meaning that a lender that wants credit information to determine whether to offer a loan has to give data on its customers back to the credit bureaus in return for that information. The credit bureaus, fostered by regulatory choices and consolidation, were the first wave of big data firms, laying the groundwork for corporations like Google and Facebook years later.</span></p><p>A different corporation, applies an algorithm to these credit bureau files to give each  consumer a specific score, which is known as a FICO score. Having one number for a credit risk simplified lending and borrowing, especially as loans were split up into tranches and sold to Wall Street in large portfolios. In the 1990s, the government, through its various housing finance programs and entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, adopted FICO scores as a way to price mortgage loans. In many ways, FICO is the first artificial intelligence firm. </p><p><span>By the 2000s, the credit bureaus and FICO organized the national credit market, especially when it came to home buying. These firms aren’t just private entities, but have become key parts of governance. If you want to verify </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/how-equifax-became-a-private-irs" rel="">someone’s work and income</a><span>, for instance, or manage unemployment insurance claims at scale, you use one of these bureaus, most likely Equifax (which is the successor to the Retail Credit Corporation.) That firm recently </span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/equifax-inc-nyse-efx-q1-155655174.html" rel="">bragged</a><span> it signed a billion dollar contract with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, “over a billion dollars that had a price increase in it,” as well as “annual escalators.” Similarly, Experian is now running </span><a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/healthcare/100-of-the-u-s-population-now-has-a-universal-patient-identifier-qa-with-experian-health-leader-on-why-this-matters/" rel="">identity</a><span> in our health care system with NCPDP/Experian Universal Patient Identifier.</span></p><p><span>The Fair Credit Reporting Act, the first big data governance law, has been updated multiple times, expanding it to include data furnishers, allowing consumers to get free credit information, and moving regulatory enforcement of the law in 2010 from the Federal Trade Commission to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. If you find an error in your report, you can ask for it to be corrected. However, one statutory flaw with the Fair Credit Reporting Act is that responsibility for errors rests with the consumer, not the bureau. Because of this, 44% of consumers who </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/05/26/credit-report-errors-what-to-do/73816078007/#:~:text=%E2%97%BE%20Among%20those%20who%20read%20their%20reports%2C%2044%25%20found%20errors.&amp;text=%E2%97%BE%20Of%20the%20errors%2C%2027,wise%20to%20read%20their%20reports." rel="">have looked</a><span> at their credit reports found errors, which can cost credit, jobs, or government benefits.</span></p><p><span>The centralization of credit reporting and scoring had the effect of fostering market power among credit bureaus, which most consumers saw not in terms of cost, but in terms of quality and identity theft. In 2017, Equifax had one of the worst data breaches in history, one that led to Congress </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/116th-congress/house-event/LC64089/text" rel="">putting</a><span> credit bureau CEOs on the hot seat in a hearing. It didn’t dent its market position, however. So even Patrick McHenry, the most favorable Wall Street Republican, criticized the bureaus. “There is no better example than the oligopoly that was created than the three that are sitting before us here today,” he said. “Our credit reporting system would be well-served by increased competition." </span></p><p>The monetary cost not levied on consumers is paid by the lenders, employers, government, and other users of credit reports and identity services. And since completing a mortgage loan requires a FICO score from each one of the credit bureaus, what is known as a ‘trimerge,’ all three bureaus plus FICO have massive pricing power. FICO tends to lead the price increase, hiking its algorithm cost, which then allows credit bureaus to raise what they charge. These four firms are all doing quite well, which is odd, considering that mortgage lending is way down due to higher interest rates.</p><p><span>FICO, for instance, offers amazing returns to investors. FICO’s CEO, Will Lansing, has </span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4nomq47281anynu2rzwm8/Amended-complaint-10-2023.pdf?rlkey=nzhde04j1osy0io98ka5p26vo&amp;dl=0" rel="">noted</a><span> publicly  that his firm has “quite a bit of discretion in whether we want our margins to be higher or lower or where they are.” In 2023, its operating margin </span><a href="https://fico.gcs-web.com/static-files/20bbbc58-1ef1-4881-8504-2c94975b8c0b" rel="">was</a><span> 51%, and it spent just $159 million on research vs $407.3 million of stock buybacks. </span></p><p><span>The three bureaus are benefitting as well.

In 2006, the three credit bureaus decided they were tired of FICO’s position in the industry, and created a rival, called VantageScore, offering credit ratings for much cheaper than FICO and setting off a litigation war within the industry. FICO immediately sued, alleging an antitrust violation, and even trying to </span><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-mnd-0_06-cv-04112/pdf/USCOURTS-mnd-0_06-cv-04112-5.pdf" rel="">trademark</a><span> the idea of giving credit scores between 300-850. </span></p><p><span>Though they </span><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-mnd-0_06-cv-04112/pdf/USCOURTS-mnd-0_06-cv-04112-5.pdf" rel="">lost that suit in 2010</a><span>, they continued litigation and political attacks, including </span><a href="https://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/UpdatedCreditScoring_2017.pdf" rel="">hiring</a><span> the Progressive Policy Institute in 2017 to write a pseudo-academic paper supporting their monopoly to fool policymakers.</span></p><p><span>Still, the campaign worked. VantageScore never caught on in the mortgage lending part of credit scoring, instead serving as a cheap proxy for credit. When you see a free credit score on most sites, it’s usually not FICO, it’s VantageScore. In 2011, VantageScore </span><a href="https://consumerfed.org/press_release/annual-survey-reveals-that-low-income-consumers-are-most-likely-to-seek-credit-yet-know-the-least-about-credit-scores/" rel="">partnered</a><span> with the Consumer Federation of America, and tried to make the argument that its scores were better for low-income consumers, in the hopes that </span><a href="https://www.fdic.gov/resources/regulations/federal-register-publications/2013/2013-credit_risk_retention-c_22.pdf" rel="">regulators</a><span> would give them a place in the credit scoring world next to FICO. In 2013, VantageScore released its </span><a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/credit/i/vantagescore-30" rel="">3.0 model</a><span>, which scored 30-35 million Americans who couldn’t get a FICO score. It differentiated medical debt, while FICO did not. </span></p><p><span>VantageScore, though, served its purpose. In a complex set of lawsuits and negotiations from 2013 to 2018, FICO and the bureaus seemed to have come to a set of arrangements to jointly hike prices. Though contract terms are still confidential, some details have come out in an </span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4nomq47281anynu2rzwm8/Amended-complaint-10-2023.pdf?rlkey=nzhde04j1osy0io98ka5p26vo&amp;dl=0" rel="">ongoing antitrust suit</a><span> in Illinois by banks against FICO and the three bureaus. The claim is that the four firms are now a cartel.</span></p><p>Contracts between FICO and the bureaus create a set of reciprocal obligations. The contracts include a “no equivalent product” clause that prohibits a credit bureau from developing or distributing a non-FICO analytic. It also includes a “dynamic royalty schedule” that allows FICO to charge seven times more if a lender uses a non-FICO score. In return, the bureaus all get the same price from FICO through a ‘level playing field’ clause, which means they know their costs are identical and so can coordinate pricing more easily. </p><p><span>The net effect is that FICO ends up coordinating pricing in the industry. When FICO hikes prices, so do the credit bureaus. Equifax CEO Begor </span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4nomq47281anynu2rzwm8/Amended-complaint-10-2023.pdf?rlkey=nzhde04j1osy0io98ka5p26vo&amp;dl=0" rel="">said</a><span> in 2019 that when FICO “put through a price increase . . . Equifax[,] TU and Experian deliver[ed] that price increase to the marketplace, when they increase the price of their credit score. So that rolled through.”</span></p><p>It’s not that hard to come up with a model for underwriting that is reasonably accurate; any bank with scale could probably do it. But FICO uses trade secrets, copyright, patents, or restrictive contracts to block anyone from doing so. A contact in the industry sent me a sample contract, which is full of absurd restrictions on the ability to use FICO scores. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png" width="606" height="659" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:659,&quot;width&quot;:606,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:300805,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70964134-a08b-4b03-9453-66e424df56a5_606x659.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>FICO prohibits not only validating different models against FICO scores, but even displaying FICO scores next to non-FICO scores. All of these tactics are an invitation to the Antitrust Division to investigate the industry, which it periodically has, most recently </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fico-statement-regarding-antitrust-investigation-301024452.html" rel="">in 2020</a><span>. </span></p><p>And there’s another reason it’s impossible to move away from FICO - switching costs. FICO scores on top of a credit bureau file are baked into the operations of most banks and Wall Street buyers of mortgage bonds. One major lender, for instance, identified over 600 places it was using a FICO score in its business processes. Citibank undertook an 18 month operational review just to move to an updated FICO score. And when investors buy mortgage-backed securities, the FICO scores of the loans are a key mechanism to figure out how to price them. Banks hate change and risk, and a different credit scoring system introduces both.</p><p>Still, for the most part, the credit bureaus stayed off the radar, because the cost of a score had been low compared to the credit product. If you’re making a half a million dollar loan, who cares if you have to shell out $10 for a credit pull?  The bureaus and FICO sell to a broad range of customers, including banking, insurance, retail, healthcare and the government. A little bit of cost for each of them isn’t a big deal, especially when they can pass those costs onward.</p><p><span>But recently, that dynamic changed. In 2022, FICO announced a series of what would become an aggregate 500% price increase for the mortgage industry over the next two years. The reason is likely that the firm’s CEO, Will Lansing, </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/highest-paid-ceo-2023-charts-0d65be3b?st=i5zuxt34reeeoek&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share" rel="">had</a><span> significant payment contingent on the stock price performance in 2023. And it worked, Lansing was the fifth highest paid CEO in America that year. And though FICO claims it doesn’t set the overall price for credit scores (though many in the industry are skeptical), its stock price reflected much higher margins. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png" width="725" height="487" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:487,&quot;width&quot;:725,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:83920,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3255626c-5d3d-49e7-a0e3-a733b339e1cb_725x487.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>And a backlash began among their customers, notably mortgage lenders. It’s a bad time to be a mortgage lender, with high interest rates absolutely killing the mortgage market. </p><p>A few years ago, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which runs most housing finance for the government through its control of secondary mortgage buyers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, decided that it might want to create some competition for FICO. So it turned to VantageScore. Only, it got backlash from Wall Street, which didn’t want to bother changing their models for mortgage backed securities.</p><p><span>Instead of allowing mortgage lenders to pick either FICO or VantageScore, FHFA simply required that lenders use both. So now, instead of having to deal with one monopoly, mortgage lenders will have to deal with two, buying two scores appended to different credit bureaus. That </span><a href="https://www.icba.org/newsroom/news-and-articles/2023/06/23/icba-groups-raise-concerns-with-new-fhfa-credit-score-models" rel="">made</a><span> the whole industry mad. And then FICO </span><a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/mortgage-group-asks-regulators-to-stop-ficos-price-hikes-of-up-to-400/" rel="">began</a><span> hiking prices, ostensibly to prepare for this new regime, but in reality simply because they could.</span></p><p>The prospect of having to buy more credit scores at a higher price, all at a time when there are significantly fewer customers, has sent mortgage bankers into a frenzy. If nothing is done, mortgage bankers will have to ask customers upfront to pay for their own credit scoring, which will radically limit who can get a loan.</p><p><span>There are additional problems. When a mortgage banker does a credit pull for a consumer, the credit bureau then puts that consumer on a list, and sells his data to other mortgage bankers. These ‘</span><a href="http://www.brokersdata.com/mortgage-trigger-leads.html" rel="">trigger leads</a><span>’ annoy everyone; when you sign up for anything in real estate, you get a zillion calls and emails, because the bureaus sell your data. And the banker who paid for your credit report now has a lot of people calling to try and poach the customer whose credit report you already paid for. Moreover, consumers can’t reuse credit information; every mortgage banker has to order a new credit report and score for the same consumer, which is just more money transferred to FICO and the bureaus from the lender and consumer.</span></p><p><span>When Rohit Chopra spoke in front of mortgage bankers and lambasted FICO and the credit bureaus, he was pushing on an open door. He offered a creative interpretation of a dormant provision of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which included price caps for utility-style functions like credit reporting, “a fair and reasonable fee,” </span><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1681g" rel="">according to the law</a><span>, when a consumer buys their credit information. The FTC </span><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2004-11-08/html/04-24841.htm" rel="">never</a><span> did much with this section, in the Bush era when the law was passed.</span></p><p><span>It’s not a perfectly applicable legal tool; the law caps prices for what consumers pay, not lenders, but that’s a technical question that can be overcome. Chopra </span><a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/prepared-remarks-of-cfpb-director-rohit-chopra-at-the-mortgage-bankers-association/" rel="">cited</a><span> this law, and asked the industry to propose ideas “to address price gouging in this market.” Chopra mentioned another authority, which is the ability that the CFPB has to force financial entities to let consumers port their financial information from one entity to another. With a price cap and interoperability, consumers could take their credit score from one mortgage banker to another, without those bankers having to pay for a new credit pull each time. </span></p><p><span>(As an aside, if you want to act on this problem, the CFPB recently opened a </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/06/06/2024-12443/request-for-information-regarding-fees-imposed-in-residential-mortgage-transactions" rel="">public comment docket</a><span> for people to weigh in on what to do about these junk fees and asked the mortgage industry to add their thoughts. Individuals from the industry should weigh in, as the Mortgage Bankers Association is conflicted and cannot represent the industry effectively. The deadline for comments is August 6).</span></p><p><span>There are other possible solutions. More competition would be good. In March, Senator Josh Hawley </span><a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-calls-doj-investigate-fico-anticompetitive-practices/" rel="">asked</a><span> the Antitrust Division to investigate FICO again over its recent price hikes. It should, and that could encourage the firms to stop their aggressive gouging. There are also private suits; the current antitrust case against FICO is proceeding apace. In addition, the FHFA could change its poor decision, and allow mortgage lenders to pick either FICO or VantageScore, which would foster price competition among them. That would require some significant technical changes to how Fannie and Freddie package loans, but they can do that if they want. And then of course Congress could act, and either pass explicit price caps in this particular area, since FICO is clearly a utility, or force FICO to just let other entities use their algorithm so it faces competition.</span></p><p>One of the more interesting dynamics in politics today is what happens when groups of business leaders collectively realize they are being subjected to a coercive monopoly. They often look around and start seeing what others are facing as well. Today, that’s happening among mortgage bankers. What’s particularly interesting is that those HousingWire reporters, who write about and are favorable to mortgage bankers, actually started to notice other consumer harms that Chopra highlighted about credit reporting, once they saw that consumers and bankers were in the same boat. </p><p>Is there a broader lesson here? Well, it’s that in a sense, all of us who make money doing honest business or buying from honest businesses have an interest in the rule of law and assertive regulators. It’s not a coincidence that the people most sympathetic to the problems facing mortgage bankers is Rohit Chopra, an anti-monopolist consumer protection regulator, and Josh Hawley, a populist Senator. After all, who is the real threat to mortgage banking? The CFPB, who is trying to control the costs that they have to pay, and protect consumers at the same time? Or FICO and the credit bureau cartel, who are raising prices in the midst of collapsing demand?</p><p>That’s a lesson being re-learned, in a broader sense, not just by mortgage bankers today, but by independent pharmacists, grocery store owners, farmers and ranchers, app developers, Hollywood producers, doctors, car repair shop owners, and anyone seeing their livelihood squeezed by a coercive middleman. Eventually, someone hits on either government regulation or antitrust, and then the conversations start. In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote that “governments are instituted” in order to “to secure these rights” of “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” These kinds of problems aren’t just something government can tackle, but why a free people build governments in the first place.</p><p><span>Thanks for reading!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Google Search will stop its <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-rolling-out-continuous-scroll-on-mobile-375171">continuous scroll</a> user experience where Google loads more results as you scroll past the first page of the search results. Instead, you will see see the classic and old pagination bar at the footer of the Google Search results.</p>



<p><strong>Desktop first. </strong>Starting today, Google will start to turn off continuous scroll for the desktop Google Search results. </p>



<p>Google launched continuous scroll on desktop search in <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-brings-continuous-scroll-to-desktop-search-results-390004">December 2022</a> and first in mobile search in <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-rolling-out-continuous-scroll-on-mobile-375171">October 2021</a>.  So continuous scroll only lasted about a year and a half for desktop search.</p>



<p>Google will remove continuous scroll from the mobile search results in the coming month.</p>



<p><strong>What Google said. </strong>A Google spokesperson told Search Engine Land that today, June 25, removing the ability to continuously scroll on desktop Search results, followed by mobile in the coming months. </p>



<p>The “Next” at the bottom of the page will show on desktop search and the “More results” button will show on mobile search.</p>



<p>Google said this change is to allow the search company to serve the search results faster on more searches, instead of automatically loading results that users haven’t explicitly requested. Google also told us that it found that loading more results automatically didn’t lead to significantly higher satisfaction with Google Search.</p>



<p><strong>What continuous scroll looks like on desktop.&nbsp;</strong>Here is a GIF of continues scroll in action on desktop search:</p>

<p><strong>Why we care. </strong>If you were on page two, you may see less clicks to your website. It all depends on if those searchers scroll and now click to the next page. Also this&nbsp;<a href="https://searchengineland.com/how-googles-continuous-scroll-can-affect-impressions-and-ctr-375738">may impact your Search Console data</a>&nbsp;because searchers may scroll more or less versus click the “Next” button.</p>

  <p>The Phil Hartman story could — and perhaps should ‚ be told in two parts.</p><p>In the first story, a charismatic comic goes from the stand-up circuit to <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, becoming an invaluable cast member on America’s most hallowed skit show and graduating to legendary roles on <em>The Simpsons</em>. In the second, an actor on the brink of genuine stardom is murdered, the victim of a terrifying act of domestic violence.</p><p>These stories are best kept distinct in order to fully appreciate Hartman, who – like many tragic artists before him – runs the risk of becoming all but synonymous with his sensational death. His life was so much more than his tragic and infamous killing, enshrined not only in his art, but his charismatic personality often celebrated by his many co-stars and collaborators. We’ll never hear him as Zapp Brannigan or see him in the Troy McClure film he was planning, but thankfully, we’ll always have “<a href="https://youtu.be/cVFsS-AcnjM"><span>A Fish Called Selma</span></a>,” and we’ll never have to go without <a href="https://youtu.be/b5wfPlgKFh8"><span>his pitch-perfect Reagan</span></a>.</p><p>There is, however, a third thread to Hartman’s story, a chapter of public life that’s far less recognized than his indelible screen presence. It picks up long before his charismatic rise to the peak of comedy, when Hartman was more class clown than class act, a Canadian kid moving about the United States. Still going by Hartmann, his birth name, Phil graduated from Westchester High in Los Angeles, taking up art at Santa Monica City College. He soon dropped out to become a roadie for local rock band <a href="http://www.thefinalvinyl.com/rocknfoo.htm"><span>Rockin’ Foo</span></a> and, when the group needed art for <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Rockin-Foo-Rockin-Foo/master/634497"><span>their debut</span></a>, his past as a visual art student made him a natural candidate for the job. The four-piece must’ve liked his work, as Hartmann illustrated — and signed — the art to both <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Rockin-Foo-Rockin-Foo/master/700801"><span>their first and second records</span></a>.</p>

  <p>In 1972, three years on from dropping out, Hartmann started studying graphic design at California State University. This time around he graduated, but not before taking on some projects from his music scene connections. In ‘72 alone, Phil cut covers for power pop four-piece <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bones_(band)"><span>Bones</span></a>, boasting an approachable group photo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Food_and_Drug_Act_(band)"><span>The Pure Food and Drug Act</span></a>, whose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeT76FLDC68&amp;list=OLAK5uy_mUmWJCZMdA2sDP2y43XQLJFL074XxHMnA&amp;ab_channel=PureFoodandDrugAct-Topic"><span>sole record</span></a> bears an FDA-inspired stamp; and Pure Food and Drug Act member <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Mandel"><span>Harvey Mandel</span></a>, for whom Hartmann depicted the scale-laden psychedelia of <a href="https://youtu.be/lVYnmj3t3Ww"><span><em>The Snake</em></span></a>.</p><p>On graduating, Phil opened his own graphic design studio and started taking on commissions. His first big client came to him through his brother, former Geffen-Roberts staffer John Hartmann, who’d recently left that fledgling managerial company and started his own business with Harlan Goodman. <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/2194684-Hartmann-Goodman"><span>Hartmann &amp; Goodman</span></a> had managed to make away with a couple of Geffen’s clients, including British rock trio America — you know what they say, a Goodman is a Hartmann to find — but it was their totally new relationship with country rock band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poco"><span>Poco</span></a> that saw Phil strike up a rapport.</p><p>In hindsight, it’s possible to see Poco as something of an odds-and-ends band. That’s not how it was at the time, but the group — founded by Buffalo Springfield alumni Richie Furay and Jim Messina — might be best remembered as a repository for the immense talent within. Bassist Randy Meisner left during their first record, taking the band’s country rock approach to new heights by co-founding The Eagles. His successor in Poco, Timothy B. Schmidt, would later succeed him in The Eagles after tensions led to a vicious backstage brawl. Poco carved out a string of classic rock hits, but their legacy is often positioned between what had been and what would eventually come to pass.</p><p>It makes sense that Hartmann &amp; Goodman would have had a connection to Poco, seeing as Geffen-Roberts had managed acts such as Buffalo Springfield’s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Stephen-Stills-Stephen-Stills-2/release/2221225"><span>Stephen Stills</span></a> and Randy Meisner’s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Eagles-Eagles/master/59496"><span>The Eagles</span></a> in the early 1970s. The first record on which Hartmann &amp; Goodman managed the group, 1974’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_(Poco_album)"><span><em>Seven</em></span></a>, was also the first to boast Phil’s artwork, a minimalist image of an upright horseshoe on a solid green backdrop. If there’s nothing radical about the piece, it does speak to a few simple tenets of the group, imparting luck on their first post-Richie Furay record, tethering them to a classic symbol of country living, and tapping into the folklore of the untamed frontier.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Phil’s second commission came just seven months later, when the quartet dropped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantamos"><span><em>Cantamos</em></span></a>, a return to their lighter country-rock roots. Phil’s familiar Navajo-inspired textile pattern fits the sound, his folksy ochre palette tethering the Californian record to the distant folklore of the American Southwest. A quaint illustration sits inset, showing the four members jamming away inside a log cabin, flanked by a wood-burning stove. It’s cozy, it’s intimate, it’s unadorned: their electric riffs on hold, the art seems to centre the return of the classic, easygoing Poco.</p><p>Hartmann’s graphic design breakout – if it could be called that – came in 1975, the same year that he joined the then-new Groundlings sketch troupe. Phil designed two albums that year: Poco’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_over_Heels_(Poco_album)"><span><em>Head Over Heels</em></span></a>, a poppier tack that nonetheless flopped, and America’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History:_America%27s_Greatest_Hits"><span><em>History</em></span></a>, a bestselling document of that West Coast trio’s first five years. That’s more on Dewey Bunnell, Gerry Beckley and Dan Peek’s hitmaking prowess than anything else, but Hartmann’s visuals make for a tender front to that premature celebration.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Silver-Silver/release/965407"><span>one and only record</span></a> by L.A. quintet Silver, featuring the brother of Eagles member Bernie Leadon, was overseen by Hartmann &amp; Goodman. It’s no surprise that Phil was responsible for the fairly simple design, framing pictures taken by prolific music photographer <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/620325-Guy-Webster"><span>Guy Webster</span></a>. If these records had seen Hartmann in more unadventurous straits — bulky, patterned and often revolving about the photos of others — his biggest personal achievement came in 1978, when Poco released their eleventh record, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_(Poco_album)"><span><em>Legend</em></span></a>.</p><p><em>“I did over 40 album covers, including the white Poco album,”</em> said Hartman <a href="https://archive.vn/20120711225150/http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/H/Hartman_Phil/1996/12/01/758979.html#selection-983.46-983.71"><span>in a 1996 interview</span></a>. <em>“That's the only piece I have up in my office.”</em> More than just a passion project or a point of pride, <em>Legend</em> was both a personal achievement for Phil and a commercial peak for the radically restructured group. Arriving after years of commercial failure, <em>Legend </em>was recorded by Poco members Paul Cotton and Rusty Young, whose decision to start their own outfit was trumped by the label’s need for brand recognition. A radio-friendly pivot surely helped the record sell, but Hartmann’s cover can’t have hurt those figures, his minimalist rendering of a galloping horse befitting the lofty title.</p>

  <p>It’s little more than a handful of lines, arranged to both cut a figure and imply a shape unseen. The red eye sits as a solitary splash of colour, drawing the audience’s own to the deceptive simplicity of that eight-line head. It’s not hard to see why the cover ended up mounted on Phil’s office wall – not only is it entirely his own vision and handiwork, but it’s easily a standout in his oft-simple portfolio. It might’ve been the peak, or maybe it was just the best so far: either way, that very year, Phil made his acting debut in Brian Trenchard-Smith’s Ozploitation film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunt_Rock"><span><em>Stunt Rock</em></span></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1979, Phil’s work with the Groundlings saw him become a leader in the troupe. He helped fellow Groundling Paul Reubens develop<em> </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pee-wee_Herman_Show"><span><em>The Pee-wee Herman Show</em></span></a>, a stage show that found its way to HBO in 1981. All the while, Hartmann took on a few more graphic design commissions, designing art for Michael Murphey’s 1979 record, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Michael-Murphey-Peaks-Valleys-Honky-Tonks-Alleys/master/643034"><span><em>Peaks Valleys Honky-Tonks &amp; Alleys</em></span></a>, which stressed folksy photography; America’s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/America-Silent-Letter/release/2650722"><span><em>Silent Letter</em></span></a>, which saw Phil working with photographer <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/2235282-Gary-Heery"><span>Gary Heery</span></a>; and The Firesign Theatre’s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/The-Firesign-Theatre-Fighting-Clowns/master/331971"><span><em>Fighting Clowns</em></span></a>, which fused his worlds of troupe comedy and graphic design.&nbsp;</p><p>His final credits include a cover for America satellite <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Avalon-Everyman-A-King/master/1354123"><span>Avalon</span></a>, an AOR trio whose only record bore some graphic similarities to America’s <em>Harbor</em>, as well as two of Poco’s final records, 1982’s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Poco-Ghost-Town/master/303556"><span><em>Ghost Town</em></span></a> and 1984’s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Poco-Inamorata/master/415655"><span><em>Inamorata</em></span></a>. These final assignments were the product of faith alone – Hartmann &amp; Goodman hadn’t managed Poco since <em>Legend</em>, and their late return to the younger Hartmann’s vision falls as a vote of confidence.&nbsp;Phil was confident too, but about something else altogether: in 1985, he co-wrote and appeared in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pee-wee%27s_Big_Adventure"><span><em>Pee-wee’s Big Adventure</em></span></a>, a role that helped him secure his place at <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. Phil’s graphic design days were over: he dropped the second ‘n’ from his surname, and the newly-christened Phil Hartman stepped to the national stage.</p>

  <p>On October 11 1986, Phil Hartman made his debut on the 12th season of SNL. It was just two days later that America submitted their revised sales numbers to the RIAA, earning a quadruple platinum plaque for <em>History</em>. That’s more than four million copies in a little over a decade. The band haven’t run the numbers again in the thirty-six years since, but one thing’s for sure: even before he stepped onto the stage at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, Hartmann’s art had gone international.</p><p>These days, it seems that Hartmann’s most famous covers are the ones he didn’t design. A persistent rumour that he designed the cover for Steely Dan’s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/Steely-Dan-Aja/master/16921"><span><em>Aja</em></span></a> isn’t all that far-fetched, given the proximity of Poco — bassist Schmidt sung backing vocals on three <em>Aja</em> tracks — and the minimalist bent that characterised some of Phil’s work. It’s nice to believe that Hartmann might’ve been hip to the Dan, but <em>Aja</em> owes its striking cover to photographer <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/2983708-Hideki-Fujii"><span>Hideki Fujii</span></a> and graphic designers <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/3226490-Patricia-Mitsui"><span>Patricia Mitsui</span></a> and <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/1123834-Geoff-Westen?type=Credits&amp;subtype=Visual&amp;filter_anv=0"><span>Geoff Westen</span></a>. It’s also easy to see why some believe that Hartmann was responsible for America’s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/America-Hearts/master/67408"><span><em>Hearts</em></span></a>, but that cover was designed by the ever-prolific Gary Burden.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, there are more Hartmann covers out there. The man himself ballparked his folio at <em>“more than 40”</em> pieces, but Discogs puts just 21 covers to his name, suggesting that there’s just as many still waiting to be exhumed, their attributions yet to make it to the internet. It could be that they’re long out of print, tethered to minor projects that have since faded from our collective memory, or perhaps it’s an issue with credits, like <a href="https://imgur.com/a/q7fJYQf"><span>his Crosby, Stills and Nash logo</span></a>.</p><p>That’s stuff we might never know. If one thing’s for sure, it’s that whether you know him as Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Lionel Hutz or Troy McClure, you might remember Phil Hartman from more places than you’d think. </p>

                    <h2>
                        Why x^2 isn't always x*x.
                    </h2>
                

                

                
                    
                        <p>You've got a wall in your apartment and a couch. You measure the wall with a ruler and get 7 feet, then you measure the couch and get 7 feet. Can you fit the couch against that wall?</p>
<p>Maybe. If the two measure is <em>exactly</em> 7 feet than sure, 7 ≤ 7. But you probably didn't line your measuring stick up perfectly with the couch, and also the stick itself might be a tiny bit long. There's some uncertainty around the edges, say 1/10th of a foot. </p>
<p>Instead of treating each as exactly 7 feet, we can instead say that each is <em>somewhere</em> between a minimum of 6.9 feet and a maximum of 7.1. We can write this as an <strong>interval</strong> (6.9, 7.1). From there, we can say interval (a, b) is "definitely less than" another interval (c, d) if <code>b &lt; c</code>, ie the first interval ends before the second starts. Since 7.1 !&lt; 6.9, we can't say for certain that the couch will fit against the wall. Your couch could actually be 7.1 feet and the wall 6.9 feet, or 7.05 and 7.01 feet, anything like that.</p>
<h2>More arithmetic</h2>
<p>When adding/multiplying/subtracting/dividing an interval by a scalar (single number), we just apply the op to both ends. I'll be using <a href="https://frinklang.org/" target="_blank">frink</a> because it has a built-in interval type.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>  i[a, b] := new interval [a, b]
  i[2, 4] + 2
[4, 6]

  i[2, 4] * 2
[4, 8]
</code></pre></div>
<p>Operating on two intervals is more complicated. The general principle is "pick a value from each interval that, when operating, give the minimum value, and do the same for the maximum value". If you measure two lengths as 3 ± 1 foot, then the length of both of them together must be 6 ± 2 feet. We can get this by just adding the minimums and maximums of the intervals together.</p>

<p>If we measure a rectangle's length as <code>(5, 7)</code> and it's width as <code>(3, 4)</code>, what's the area? Multiplication <em>seems</em> like it'd be the same as addition, just multiply the two minimums and the two maximums together:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>  i[5, 7] * i[3, 4]
[15, 28]
</code></pre></div>
<p>But this is breaks down when intervals cover negative numbers. If we just multiplied minimums and maximums, <code>(-3, 3) * (-3, 3)</code> would give us <code>(9, 9)</code>. But we instead get the true minimum by picking -3 from the first interval and 3 from the second, which gives us -9. So the real interval is <code>(-9, 9)</code>.</p>
<p>What about division? It works kinda like multiplication, <em>except</em> if the dividing interval spans 0, the result is undefined. Overall, interval arithmetic is like regular arithmetic except with more headaches.</p>
<h3>Trouble in paradise</h3>
<p>Now, how about <code>(-3, 3)²</code>? On first thought we say <code>(-3, 3)² = (-3, 3)*(-3, 3)</code>, which gives us the same interval <code>(-9, 9)</code>. But again, that's wrong. In <code>(-3, 3)*(-3, 3)</code>, we pick one number from each interval and multiply them together, while in <code>(-3, 3)^2</code> we pick one number from the interval and multiply it by itself. So the actual interval is <code>(0, 9)</code>. </p>


<p>But wait, doesn't that mean that <code>x*x != x^2</code>? Yes, it does. Err no, it doesn't. Maybe. It depends on what we mean by "x".</p>
<h3>The two interpretations</h3>
<ol>
<li><code>x</code> is some value in the interval <code>(-3, 3)</code>, but we don't know what it is. Then <code>x*x</code> is the same value both times, so it should be <code>(0, 9)</code>.</li>
<li><code>x</code> is "smeared out" over the <em>entire interval</em>. Then <code>x*x</code> can be treated as two separate intervals, giving us <code>(-9, 9)</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now usually people use intervals to mean [1], but most interval arithmetic systems I've seen do [2], or at least a mix of both with a bias towards [2]. </p>
<p>There's two reasons why. First of all, you can reason about [2] locally. Consider the equation <code>y = sin(x)*cos(x)</code> where x is the interval <code>(0, 2π)</code>.<sup id="fnref:tau"><a href="#fn:tau">1</a></sup> Figuring out <code>y</code> under [2] is easy: it's just <code>(-1*1, 1*1) = (-1, 1)</code>. But this is impossible under [1], because sin is only ±1 when cos is 0! The actual interval under [1] is <code>(-0.5, 0.5)</code>. </p>
<p>Notice that <code>(-0.5, 0.5)</code> is a subinterval of <code>(-1, 1)</code>. That's the other reason to assume [2] in calculations: the result will always cover [1]. </p>
<p>Nonetheless [2] leads to lots of weird behavior, like <code>x*x != x^2</code>. This is called <em>overdetermination</em> and leads to <em>overestimation</em>, where your interval bounds are too wide to be that useful to you. Frink tries to be smart about this, and will in some cases rewrite interval arithmetic to avoid overdetermination, even when you <em>want</em> the intervals to be different.</p>

<p>This is all moot if we assign the same value interval to <code>(-3, 3)</code> to different variables, though, because then the interpretations of [1] and [2] don't have any differences.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>  x = i[-3, 3]
  y = i[-3, 3]
  x*y
[-9, 9]

<p>If a (double precision) floating point calculation lands in the interval <code>(0.3 - 3e-17, 0.3 + 3e-17)</code>, it's collapsed to the value <code>0.3</code>. This has lead to some proposals to use interval arithmetic <em>instead of</em> floating point. An interval may be less <em>precise</em> than a single FP number, but it will be more <em>accurate</em>: you won't have an exact number but you'll know that the correct number is somewhere in the bounds. While a bunch of FP computations will always give you an exact number, but it could be very far from the actual answer. </p>
<p>These proposals have been around as long as floating point. The father of the IEEE-754 standard, <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/754story.html" target="_blank">William Kahan</a>, <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/Mindless.pdf" target="_blank">wrote an essay</a> about why interval arithmetic can't replace FP. His argument comes back to overestimation: in most computations, interval boundaries grow too big to be useful. </p>
<p>He wrote that back in 2006. Since then, there's been one big new interval arithmetic proposal: John Gutafson's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unum_(number_format)" target="_blank">universal numbers</a>. I <em>think</em> his <a href="http://www.johngustafson.net/pdfs/BeatingFloatingPoint.pdf" target="_blank">posit version</a> isn't intervals but I'm not sure? This is well outside of the my area of expertise. I can tell, though, that Gustafson and Kahan <a href="http://www.johngustafson.net/pdfs/DebateTranscription.pdf" target="_blank">hate each other</a>.</p>
<p>That's the main connection between intervals and computer science. Of course, there are also particular domains where intervals are really important, such as in manufacturing tolerances.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://foon.uk/fixing-quicklook/">https://foon.uk/fixing-quicklook/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40792740">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        

<h2><picture>

    <img height="50" src="https://foon.uk/fixing-quicklook/img/title.svg">
</picture></h2>


<p>After upgrading from Mojave to Ventura, I noticed that Apple had changed QuickLook.
</p>
<p>QuickLook is one of my favourite pieces of software. You just select a file in the Finder, press space, and the file pops up on your screen. Then you press space again and it goes away.</p>
<p>Focus stays in the Finder, so you can use the arrow keys to select different files, and the QuickLook window updates to show them to you.</p>
<p>It's simple, well-designed, fast, tasteful and just all around excellent.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, QuickLook will now remove the corners of your images before showing them to you.</p>




<p>It doesn't matter if they're photos, game assets, or UI elements you're designing. Everything will be rounded off before you see it.
</p>
<p>Naturally, I searched around for the secret switch to make it stop. Apple is usually pretty good about letting us opt out of their latest improvements, so there has to be something, right? An accessibility setting? A cheeky <var>defaults.write</var>? As far as I can tell, there isn't.</p>
<p>So, I guess we're out of luck?</p>
<p>No. Don't think like that. It might be a Mac but it's still your computer. Let's fix this.</p>
<h2>QuickLook headers</h2><p>If we want to mess with how QuickLook displays things, we need to get at its window. Then we can hopefully poke around in the views and change how they draw.
</p>
<p>The QuickLook API is public and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quicklook?language=objc">documented</a>, and if you look through the docs you'll see that this window is called <var>QLPreviewPanel</var>, there's one instance of it per app, and you retrieve it with <var>[QLPreviewPanel&nbsp;sharedPreviewPanel]</var>.</p>
<h2>Debugging Finder</h2><p>I'd only ever used QuickLook from Finder, so that was where I thought to start. Let's bust out the debugger and see what Finder's up to:
</p>
<code><span>$ </span><span>lldb -n Finder</span><br><span>error: process exited with status -1 (attach failed (Not allowed to attach to process.))</span><br></code>
<p>Actually, first, let's deal with SIP. SIP is a new Apple technology that helps you out by stopping you from reading and writing memory on your own computer. In order to fix problems in system processes like this, we have to turn it off and reboot.
</p>
<p>Alright, let's try that again:</p>
<code><span>$ </span><span>lldb -n Finder</span><br><span>Process 4040 stopped</span><br><span> thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = signal </span><span>SIGSTOP</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>frame </span><span>#0</span><span>: </span><span>0x000000018df1bf54 </span><span>libsystem_kernel.dylib</span><span>`</span><span>mach_msg2_trap + 8</span><br><span>libsystem_kernel.dylib`mach_msg2_trap:</span><br><span>-&gt;  </span><span>0x18df1bf54</span><span> &lt;+8&gt;</span><span>: ret</span><p><span>libsystem_kernel.dylib`macx_swapon:</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>0x18df1bf58</span><span> &lt;+0&gt;</span><span>: mov&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x16, #-0x30</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>0x18df1bf5c</span><span> &lt;+4&gt;</span><span>: svc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#0x80</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>0x18df1bf60</span><span> &lt;+8&gt;</span><span>: ret</span><br><span>Target 0: (Finder) stopped.</span><br><span>Executable module set to "/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder".</span><br><span>Architecture set to: arm64e-apple-macosx-.</span></p></code>
<p>&lt;hacker-voice&gt;We're in&lt;/hacker-voice&gt; to our own machine.
</p>
<p>Let's try setting a breakpoint on <var>sharedPreviewPanel</var>.</p>
<code><span>(lldb) </span><span>break set -n sharedPreviewPanel</span><br><span>Breakpoint 5: where = QuickLookUI`+[QLPreviewPanel sharedPreviewPanel], address = 0x00000001f81c025c</span><br><span>(lldb) </span><span>c</span><br></code>
<p>Navigate to an image file, press space, and:
</p>
<code><span>Process 4040 stopped</span><br><span> thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = </span><span>breakpoint 5.1</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>frame </span><span>#0</span><span>: </span><span>0x00000001f81c025c </span><span>QuickLookUI</span><span>`</span><span>+[QLPreviewPanel sharedPreviewPanel]</span><br><span>QuickLookUI`+[QLPreviewPanel sharedPreviewPanel]:</span><br><span>-&gt;  </span><span>0x1f81c025c</span><span> &lt;+0&gt;</span><span>:  pacibsp</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>0x1f81c0260</span><span> &lt;+4&gt;</span><span>:  sub&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sp, sp, #0x40</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>0x1f81c0264</span><span> &lt;+8&gt;</span><span>:  stp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x22, x21, [sp, #0x10]</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>0x1f81c0268</span><span> &lt;+12&gt;</span><span>: stp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x20, x19, [sp, #0x20]</span><br></code>
<p>LLDB has stopped the Finder process in the <var>sharedPreviewPanel</var> function. Let's get the return value, which should be the preview panel instance:
</p>
<code><span>(lldb) </span><span>finish</span><br><span>(lldb) </span><span>po $x0</span><br><span>&lt;QLPreviewPanel: 0x119c64c90&gt;</span><br></code>
<p>Alright! We're getting somewhere. Let's see what's in this panel:
</p>
<code><span>(lldb) </span><span>po [$x0 recursiveDescription]</span><br><span>[   A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   w   ] h=--- v=--- </span><span>NSNextStepFrame</span><span> 0x12cea29b0 f=(0,0,370,223) b=(-) =&gt;

<p>This is pretty juicy. We can probably ignore <var>QPreviewTitleBarView</var> and its children, so let's focus on the other branch of the tree. There's a <var>QLPreviewBackgroundView</var>, then a bunch of <var>NSView</var>s, and then a <var>QLPanelPreviewView</var>, a <var>QLPreviewContainerView</var>, and right at the very top, an <var>NSRemoteView</var>.
</p>
<h2>NSRemote­View</h2><p>I haven't come across <var>NSRemoteView</var> before and I'm not really sure what it is. There doesn't seem to be a public header for it. I wonder how it works?
</p>
<p>Well, we might be getting ahead of ourselves here. We still don't know if the <var>NSRemoteView</var> has anything to do with our image. Let's hide it and see if our image disappears.</p>
<code><span>(lldb) </span><span>po [(NSRemoteView *)0x119c3a040 setHidden:YES]</span><br><span>(lldb) </span><span>c</span><br></code>

<p>Indeed it does. So it's this <var>NSRemoteView</var> that's actually displaying our image. The “remote” makes me think it's communicating with another process which is doing the actual rendering, so we'll probably have to look inside the remote process to see what it's doing. But which process is that? Perhaps the <var>NSRemoteView</var> can tell us? Let's see what it can do:

<p>A lot!
</p>
<p>Searching for “process” in that list of methods yields <var>_serviceProcessIdentifier</var> so let's call it.</p>
<code><span>(lldb) </span><span>po [$v _serviceProcessIdentifier]</span><br><span>5959</span><br></code>
<p>What's that process?
</p>
<code><span>$ </span><span>ps -c 5959</span><br><span>  PID TTY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   TIME CMD</span><br><span> 5959 ??&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0:14.34 QuickLookUIService</span><br></code>
<p>This has to be it. Debugging Finder isn't what we want. We need to be debugging QuickLookUIService.
</p>

<p>So, the other side of that <var>NSRemoteView</var> is... somewhere... in this process.
</p>
<p>If we could iterate through all the views in the process, we could see if any of them looked like the other end of an <var>NSRemoteViewDelegate</var>.</p>
<p>I searched the internet for a function that would get all views, but I couldn't find anything except for the odd person saying to just use Xcode.<sup><a id="ref1" href="#note1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Well, why don't we just use Xcode?</p>
<p>After opening Xcode, creating a project, choosing where to save the project, entering a team name, choosing a template, entering a bundle identifier, creating a scheme, and setting the scheme target so it'll let me use the debugger, I attached it to QuickLookUIService, pressed “Show View Hierarchy”, and:</p>

    </picture>
<figcaption>Xcode's view debugger attached to QuickLookUIService.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Well, that was easy! We can click through these views and get info about them, including their addresses so we can mess with them in the debugger. And we can see straight away that the frontmost view, which Xcode tells us is a <var>QLBorderView</var>, is a border with rounded corners!
</p>
<p>Wait, there's a border?</p>
<h2>The Border</h2><p>There is. I hadn't noticed it at first, but if you zoom in, you can see that as well as rounding the corners, QuickLook also superimposes a slightly-too-small border:
</p>
<figure>
    <picture>
        <source srcset="https://foon.uk/fixing-quicklook/img/big-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
        <img src="https://foon.uk/fixing-quicklook/img/big-light.png">
    </picture>
    <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The <var>QLBorderView</var> turns out to be very simple; it's just a view whose layer has a <var>borderWidth</var> and a <var>borderColor</var>. Let's get its address from Xcode and tell it to cut it out:
</p>
<code><span>(lldb) </span><span>po [0x600000850180 setBorderWidth:0];</span><br></code>

<figure>

        <img src="https://foon.uk/fixing-quicklook/img/big-borderless-light.png">
    </picture>
    <figcaption>Border successfully removed!</figcaption>
</figure>


<h2>Unclipping</h2><p>So, the border is gone, but the corners are still rounded. We can see in the view debugger that the image view's corners are not rounded, so something must be clipping it.
</p>
<p>Let's have a look through all of the parent views' layers and see if any of them have a nonzero <var>cornerRadius</var>.</p>
<p>You could probably write some code to do this but I just clicked through each one and copied its layer's address into the debugger to check:</p>
<code><span>(lldb) </span><span>p [(CALayer *)0x60000283f5a0 cornerRadius]</span><br><span>(double) $78 = 0</span><br><span>(lldb) </span><span>p [(CALayer *)0x60000283f660 cornerRadius]</span><br><span>(double) $79 = 0.43438914027149322</span><br></code>
<p>Well, that didn't take long. Let's try...
</p>
<code><span>(lldb) </span><span>po [0x60000283f660 setMasksToBounds:0]</span><br><span>(lldb) </span><span>po [0x60000283f660 setNeedsDisplay]</span><br></code>

    <figcaption>Corners restored!</figcaption>
</figure>


<h2>Keeping it that way</h2><p>So, we've now fixed our view. We can see all of our pixels.
</p>
<p>But we're not done yet, because when you click on a different file, you get a new view, and the new view is rounded. It looks like QL creates one view per previewed file, and reuses the old view only for the same file.</p>
<p>So, we need to intercept it when it makes new views and stop it from screwing them up.</p>
<p>Let's start with that border view. When is it created? We'll break on its init method, which its method list tells us is <var>initWithFrame:</var>.</p>
<code><span>(lldb) </span><span>break set -n '[QLOverlayBorderView initWithFrame:]'</span><br><span>(lldb) </span><span>c</span><br></code>
<p>This does indeed trigger when you select a new image:
</p>
<code><span>Process 5959 stopped</span><br><span>  thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = breakpoint 1.1</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>frame </span><span>#0</span><span>: </span><span>0x00000001f827c7fc </span><span>QuickLookUI</span><span>`</span><span>-[QLOverlayBorderView initWithFrame:]</span><br><span>QuickLookUI`-[QLOverlayBorderView initWithFrame:]:</span><br><span>-&gt;  </span><span>0x1f827c7fc</span><span> &lt;+0&gt;</span><span>:  pacibsp</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>0x1f827c800</span><span> &lt;+4&gt;</span><span>:  sub&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sp, sp, #0x30</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>0x1f827c804</span><span> &lt;+8&gt;</span><span>:  stp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x20, x19, [sp, #0x10]</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>0x1f827c808</span><span> &lt;+12&gt;</span><span>: stp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x29, x30, [sp, #0x20]</span><br><span>Target 0: (QuickLookUIService) stopped.</span><br></code>
<p>Let's see who's calling us:
</p>
<code><span>(lldb) </span><span>bt 5</span><br><span>  thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = breakpoint 1.1</span><br><span>  * </span><span>frame </span><span>#0</span><span>: </span><span>0x00000001f827c7fc </span><span>QuickLookUI</span><span>`</span><span>-[QLOverlayBorderView initWithFrame:]</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>frame </span><span>#1</span><span>: </span><span>0x00000001f8203128 </span><span>QuickLookUI</span><span>`</span><span>-[QLDisplayBundleViewController enableBorder] + 968</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>frame </span><span>#2</span><span>: </span><span>0x0000000106a02f80 </span><span>Image</span><span>`</span><span>___lldb_unnamed_symbol317 + 84</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>frame </span><span>#3</span><span>: </span><span>0x00000001f8202cb8 </span><span>QuickLookUI</span><span>`</span><span>-[QLDisplayBundleViewController _updateOverlayBorder] + 88</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>frame </span><span>#4</span><span>: </span><span>0x00000001f8203264 </span><span>QuickLookUI</span><span>`</span><span>-[QLDisplayBundleViewController observeValueForKeyPath:ofObject:change:context:] + 108</span><br></code>
<p>Interesting. The border view is being called from something called <var>enableBorder</var>. What if we disabled <var>enableBorder</var>?
</p>
<p>There are no docs for the <var>QLDisplayBundleViewController</var>, of course, but there's always a method list:</p>
<code><span>(lldb) </span><span>po [$x0 fp_shortMethodDescription]</span><br><span>&lt;QLImageDisplayBundleViewController: 0x13053d770&gt;:</span><br><span>in QLImageDisplayBundleViewController:</span><br><span>	Properties:</span><br><span>		@property (readonly) IKImageView2* imageView;</span><br><span>	Instance Methods:</span><br><span>		- (id) imageView; </span><span>(0xf978000106a02cf8)</span><br><span>		- (BOOL) _epsilonEqualRect:(CGRect)arg1 toRect:(CGRect)arg2; </span><span>(0x8f22800106a02d50)</span><br><span>		- (BOOL) useLayerMaskForCorners; </span><span>(0xe439000106a02dbc)</span><br><span>		- (void) updateContentCornerRadius; </span><span>(0x582e800106a02e8c)</span><br><span>		- (void) didSave:(BOOL)arg1 toURL:(id)arg2 forClosing:(BOOL)arg3; </span><span>(0xf67c000106a02e90)</span><br><span>		- (void) enableBorder; </span><span>(0x7b35800106a02f2c)</span><br><span>		- (void) disableBorder; </span><span>(0x9d21800106a02f90)</span><br><span>		- (void) teardownMarkup:(long)arg1 needsSave:(BOOL*)arg2; </span><span>(0xe96b000106a02ff4)</span><br><span>		- (BOOL) mustHandleDragAtLocation:(CGPoint)arg1; </span><span>(0xdc49800106a0305c)</span><br><span>		- (BOOL) mustHandleDoubleClickAtLocation:(CGPoint)arg1; </span><span>(0xb042800106a030b0)</span><br><span>		- (void) copy:(id)arg1; </span><span>(0x325c800106a03140)</span><br><span>		- (void) selectAll:(id)arg1; </span><span>(0xb532800106a031a4)</span><br><span>(QLDisplayBundleViewController ...)</span><br></code>
<p>As well as <var>enableBorder</var>, there's a <var>disableBorder</var>. If we're lucky it might disable the border.
</p>
<code><span>(lldb) </span><span>po [$x0 disableBorder]</span><br></code>
<p>It does! So, to fix our QuickLook process, we'll have to arrange for <var>disableBorder</var> to be called instead of <var>enableBorder</var>.<sup><a id="ref2" href="#note2">2</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Now, what about the rounded corners? We can set a breakpoint to see where the corners get rounded:</p>
<code><span>(lldb) </span><span>break set -n 'setCornerRadius:' -c '$x0 == 0x600002cbd830 &amp;&amp; $d0 != 0.0'</span><br></code>
<p>When this breakpoint is hit, we can see that it's being called from a method called <var>updateCornerRadius</var>.
</p>
<p>So, our strategy for making our fix persist will be to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Patch <var>updateCornerRadius</var> to return immediately without doing anything.
</li><li>Patch <var>enableBorder</var> to just call <var>disableBorder</var> and return.
</li></ol>


<h2>Aside: Method Swizzling</h2><p>In Objective-C, classes have methods and methods have implementations. As a holdover from the bicycle-for-the-mind days, the Objective-C runtime is hacker-friendly and provides functions to help us monkey around with things:
</p>
<code><span>Method</span><span> </span><span>class_getInstanceMethod</span><span>(</span><span>Class</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>SEL</span><span>);</span><br><span>IMP</span><span> </span><span>class_getMethodImplementation</span><span>(</span><span>Class</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>SEL</span><span>);</span><p><span>IMP</span><span> </span><span>method_getImplementation</span><span>(</span><span>Method</span><span>);</span><br><span>IMP</span><span> </span><span>method_setImplementation</span><span>(</span><span>Method</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>IMP</span><span>);</span><br><span>void</span><span> </span><span>method_exchangeImplementations</span><span>(</span><span>Method</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Method</span><span>);</span></p></code>
<p>In theory, you should be able to use these functions to switch out the implementations of <var>enableBorder</var> and <var>updateCornerRadius</var>.
</p>
<p>But, try as I might, I couldn't get it to work reliably. Maybe I was holding it wrong, but instead of spending time figuring out why, I just went straight to no-nonsense instruction patching.</p>
<h2>Patching the corner radius</h2><p>Let's patch <var>updateCornerRadius</var> to return immediately without doing anything. We'll write a <var>ret</var> instruction over the first instruction in the function.
</p>
<p>As documented in this <a href="https://documentation-service.arm.com/static/644a406baa78c007af74e6fd">76MB PDF</a>, the encoding of <var>ret</var> in ARM64 is <var>0xd65f03c0</var>.</p>
<p>We can write a simple Python script that will find the function in memory and patch it:</p>
<code><span>(lldb) </span><span>script</span><br><span>x, = lldb.target.FindSymbols('-[IKImageContentView updateCornerRadius]')</span><br><span>e = lldb.SBError()</span><br><span>lldb.process.WriteMemory(</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x.symbol.addr.load_addr,</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;struct.pack('&lt;I', 0xd65f03c0),</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e</span><br><span>)</span><br><span>assert e.Success()</span><br></code>
<p>Check it worked:
</p>
<code><span>(lldb) </span><span>dis -n updateCornerRadius -c 4</span><br><span>ImageKit`-[IKImageContentView updateCornerRadius]:</span><br><span>-&gt;  </span><span>0x1c3ec9a60</span><span> &lt;+0&gt;</span><span>:  ret</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>0x1c3ec9a64</span><span> &lt;+4&gt;</span><span>:  stp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d9, d8, [sp, #-0x30]!</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>0x1c3ec9a68</span><span> &lt;+8&gt;</span><span>:  stp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x20, x19, [sp, #0x10]</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>0x1c3ec9a6c</span><span> &lt;+12&gt;</span><span>: stp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x29, x30, [sp, #0x20]</span><br></code>
<p>Success!
</p>
<h2>Patching enableBorder</h2><p>Patching <var>enableBorder</var> is a little tricker, since we don't just want to have it <var>ret</var>, we want to have it jump to <var>disableBorder</var>.
</p>
<p>The ARM64 instruction for performing an unconditional jump is <var>b</var>, and is encoded as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The instruction is 4 bytes long, like all ARM64 instructions.
</li><li>The high 6 bits are <var>00101</var>.
</li><li>The low 26 bits are the number of instructions to jump, relative to the current instruction.
</li></ul>

<p>Each instruction is 4 bytes, so we just need to subtract the destination address from the source address, sign-extend to 26 bits, and set the high 6 bits to <var>00101</var>.
</p>
<p>Here's the Python code to do that:</p>
<code><span>(lldb) </span><span>script</span><br><span>def get_symbol_address(name):</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;symbol_context, = lldb.target.FindSymbols(name)</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return symbol_context.symbol.addr.load_addr</span><p><span>enableBorder = get_symbol_address('-[QLDisplayBundleViewController enableBorder]')</span><br><span>disableBorder = get_symbol_address('-[QLDisplayBundleViewController disableBorder]')</span></p><p><span>jump_offset_bytes = disableBorder - enableBorder</span><br><span>jump_offset_insns = jump_offset_bytes // 4</span></p><p><span>def sign_extend(val, nbits):</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return (val + (1 &lt;&lt; nbits)) % (1 &lt;&lt; nbits)</span></p><p><span>jump_insn = (5 &lt;&lt; 26) | sign_extend(jump_offset_insns, 26)</span></p><p><span>e = lldb.SBError()</span><br><span>lldb.process.WriteMemory(</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enableBorder,</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;struct.pack('&lt;I', jump_insn),</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e</span><br><span>)</span><br><span>assert e.Success()</span></p></code>
<p>Check it worked:
</p>
<code><span>(lldb) </span><span>dis -n '-[QLDisplayBundleViewController enableBorder]' -c 4</span><br><span>QuickLookUI`-[QLDisplayBundleViewController enableBorder]:</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>0x20b23ed60</span><span> &lt;+0&gt;</span><span>:  b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  0x20b23f164&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ; -[QLDisplayBundleViewController disableBorder]</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>0x20b23ed64</span><span> &lt;+4&gt;</span><span>:  stp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d15, d14, [sp, #-0x90]!</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>0x20b23ed68</span><span> &lt;+8&gt;</span><span>:  stp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d13, d12, [sp, #0x10]</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>0x20b23ed6c</span><span> &lt;+12&gt;</span><span>: stp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d11, d10, [sp, #0x20]</span><br></code>
<p>Nice! <sup><a id="ref3" href="#note3">3</a></sup>
</p>
<h2>Putting it all together</h2><p>We now have all the building blocks we need to make a nice script that attaches to all running QuickLook processes and patches them. This article is long enough already, so instead of reproducing it here I'll just link to the repo. That way you'll get any fixes that have been made since I wrote this article, too.
</p>
<p>You can find the latest version of the script <a href="https://github.com/rogual/fix-quicklook">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I am reminded of the words of the late, great Douglas Adams:
</p>
<blockquote>
The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at and repair.
</blockquote>

<p>Well, perhaps not impossible. But that was rather involved!

<h2>The bit where I try and sell you something</h2><p>Thanks for reading. If you'd like to read more from me, I've got <a href="https://foon.uk/how-flash-2022">this article</a> from last year about how I ported a Flash game to C++. My <a href="https://foon.uk/">website</a> has a bunch of free games I've made over the years, and I've also got two games out on Steam:
</p>
<p>Firstly, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/741110/Blackshift/">Blackshift</a>, an epic puzzle game which you can think of as Chip's Challenge in space.</p>
<p>And more recently, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458090/Hapland_Trilogy/">Hapland Trilogy</a>, a smaller point-and-click game.</p>
<p>If you have comments about the article, or just want to say hi, please feel free to drop me an email at <a href="mailto:r@foon.uk">r@foon.uk</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack">https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40791829">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Update June 25th</strong>: Google has already started blocking Google Ads for eCommerce sites that use polyfill.io.</p><p>The <code>polyfill.js</code> is a popular open source library to support older browsers. <a href="https://publicwww.com/websites/%22cdn.polyfill.io%22/">100K+ sites</a> embed it using the <code>cdn.polyfill.io</code> domain. Notable users are JSTOR, Intuit and World Economic Forum. However, in February this year, a Chinese company bought the domain and the Github account. Since then, this domain was caught injecting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240624110153/https://github.com/polyfillpolyfill/polyfill-service/issues/2873">malware</a> on mobile devices via any site that embeds <code>cdn.polyfill.io</code>. Any complaints were quickly removed (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240229113710/https://github.com/polyfillpolyfill/polyfill-service/issues/2834">archive here</a>) from the Github repository.</p><p>The polyfill code is dynamically generated based on the HTTP headers, so multiple attack vectors are likely. Sansec decoded one particular malware (see below) which redirects mobile users to a <a href="https://w9.vty70.net/">sports betting site</a> using a fake Google analytics domain (<code>www.googie-anaiytics.com</code>). The code has specific protection against reverse engineering, and only activates on specific mobile devices at specific hours. It also does not activate when it detects an admin user. It also delays execution when a web analytics service is found, presumably to not end up in the stats.</p><p>The original <a href="https://x.com/triblondon/status/1761852117579427975">polyfill author</a> recommends to not use Polyfill at all, as it is no longer needed by modern browsers anyway. Meanwhile, both <a href="https://community.fastly.com/t/new-options-for-polyfill-io-users/2540">Fastly</a> and <a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill">Cloudflare</a> have put up trustworthy alternatives, if you still need it.</p><p>This incident is a typical example of a supply chain attack. To get visibility into the code that your users are loading, we recommend our (free) CSP monitoring service <a href="https://sansec.io/watch">Sansec Watch</a>.</p><p>Our <a href="https://sansec.io/#ecomscan">eComscan backend scanner</a> has also been updated with <a href="https://polyfill.io/">polyfill.io</a> detection.</p><h2 id="polyfill-malicious-payload-example" tabindex="-1">Polyfill malicious payload example</h2><p>We added some names for readability, however <code>tiaozhuan</code> came from the original malware (which means "jump" in Chinese).</p><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>isPc</span>(<span></span>) {

<p>MTV.com is gone. Kaput. Wiped off the face of the Earth.</p>



<p>Parent company Paramount, formerly Viacom, has tossed twenty plus years of news archives. All that’s left is a placeholder site for reality shows. The M in MTV – music — is gone, and so is all the reporting and all the journalism performed by music and political writers ever written. It’s as if MTV never existed. (It’s the same for VH1.com, all gone.)</p>



<p>There’s no precedent for this, and no valid reason. Just cheapness and stupidity. </p>



<p>This follows the shut down of MTV News on the channel last year. MTV is now just a graveyard for reality show crap. All of its substance has been desiccated over time.</p>



<p>MTV News became a force in music, entertainment, and politics in the early 90s. As the channel’s popularity soared, the News division — including the faces of Kurt Loder, Alison Stewart, Serena Altschul, Sway, and John Norris — became incredibly important especially to political campaigns. Now all those interviews — hundreds of thousands of hours with rock stars and what we now call influencers of generations — have been replaced by a link to “Help! I’m in a Secret Relationship.”</p>



<p>Writer Kathy Iandoli posted: “<a href="https://t.co/7bPn2dLajt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MTV.com</a> deleting all of our articles and replacing them with schedules for TV shows that can also no longer be streamed on their site is proof that no one has any idea of what the hell they are doing right now.”</p>



<p>She’s not alone. There is fury among MTV.com writers past and present who now see their histories erased, along with all the music and political reporting.</p>



<p>Patrick Hosken posted: “So, <a href="https://t.co/ypQLdbaWk5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://mtvnews.com</a> no longer exists. Eight years of my life are gone without a trace. All because it didn’t fit some executives’ bottom lines. Infuriating is too small a word”</p>



<p>Michell Clark wrote: “I don’t even have the words. I was just a freelancer but I put so much blood, sweat, and tears into telling stories that I cared about, the right way, on that platform. What a gut punch.”</p>



<p>The end of the MTV.com archives is not unprecedented. When the former New York Observer was bought by Jared Kushner years ago, hundreds of articles disappeared. </p>



<p>As Paramount destroyed the library of articles, some writers managed to save a few for the WaybackMachine.com, which was just profiled for trying to hold onto evaporating information on the internet. But mostly the articles about pop culture will vanish now. </p>



<p>Paramount owner Shari Redstone has allowed something to happen here much worse than any of her recent fears about selling the company. </p>



<p>The greed of the company is obvious, as well as its lack of respect for journalism. But this is also a wake up call for anyone though the internet was forever. Not having print copies of a writer’s work is a big mistake. A big lesson is learned here.</p>

Martin Barstow, a professor of astrophysics and space science at the University of Leicester. “Recovering any samples from the moon is difficult, but doing so from the far side, where communications are particularly difficult is a step taken by no other agency. A real technological feat.”</p><p>The US, China and the former Soviet Union have gathered samples from the near side of the moon but China is the first to bring material home from the far side. The intention was to collect up to 2kg of moon rock and soil.</p><p>China previously collaborated with international scientists to study samples it brought back from the near side of the moon but it is unclear whether similar access will be granted to the new material from the far side.</p><p>The latest samples could shed light on longstanding mysteries in the early history of the moon and Earth. Ian Crawford, a professor of planetary science at Birkbeck, University of London, said dating the SPA was a “key objective” of lunar science because it would pin down the timeframe for lunar cratering.</p><p>Understanding the rate at which large asteroids battered the moon in its early history would shed light on the impact history of Earth, he added, as our home planet would be struck by the same kinds of asteroids at the same time. “Constraining this is important for understanding the impact regime under which life first appeared on Earth,” he said.</p><p>The collision that created the SPA basin may have scooped out enough rock to expose areas of the lunar mantle, which researchers believe is crucial to understanding the history, and potentially the origins, of the moon.</p><figure id="e05bd69f-bdb2-48f4-b882-6c605f14ccb2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:12,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;The new ‘space race’: what are China’s ambitions and why is the US so concerned?&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;e05bd69f-bdb2-48f4-b882-6c605f14ccb2&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/05/the-new-space-race-what-are-chinas-ambitions-and-why-is-the-us-so-concerned&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false,&quot;updateLogoAdPartnerSwitch&quot;:true,&quot;assetOrigin&quot;:&quot;https://assets.guim.co.uk/&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>“It is possible that the SPA has excavated deep enough to expose the lunar mantle, and possible that fragments might be found in the Chang’e-6 samples,” Crawford said. “It’s long shot but it’s worth looking.”</p><p>The far side of the moon has fewer ancient lava plains or maria, a thicker crust, and because it is not shielded by Earth, sports more craters from violent impacts.</p><p>“Recovering samples from the far side is tremendously exciting scientifically, as we only have very limited information on the geology there,” Barstow said. “It has been processed very differently to the side of the moon facing us, which has been extensively resurfaced by volcanic activity in the past, creating the maria from which most samples have been obtained.”</p><p>China has more lunar missions planned this decade. They are intended to pave the way for an International Lunar Research base, which it will co-lead with Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, and the eventual landing of a Chinese astronaut on the moon.</p><p>Dr Simeon Barber, a senior research fellow at the Open University, said: “We’re entering a new era of discovery, and getting samples returned from the far side is a milestone achievement that will help us understand the geological history in that region, and why it differs so markedly from the more familiar near side.</p><p>“Specialised laboratories around the world have spent five decades finessing the analytical techniques to tease out the moon’s secrets from within near side samples returned by the Apollo and Luna missions. And now we are on the cusp of applying all that expertise to learn about the enigmatic far side of our nearest neighbour in space.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Glasskube is an <strong>Open Source package manager for Kubernetes</strong>.
It makes deploying, updating, and configuring packages on Kubernetes <strong>20 times faster</strong> than tools like <strong>Helm or Kustomize</strong>.
Inspired by the simplicity of Homebrew and npm. You can decide if you want to use the Glasskube UI, CLI, or directly deploy packages via GitOps.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">⭐️ Why Glasskube?</h2><a id="user-content-️-why-glasskube" aria-label="Permalink: ⭐️ Why Glasskube?" href="#️-why-glasskube"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We have been working in the Kubernetes ecosystem for over five years.
During this time, we have consistently struggled with package management, configuration, and distribution.
We've spent countless hours templating and writing documentation for commands and concepts that were difficult to grasp.</p>
<p dir="auto">In contrast, tools like Homebrew, apt, and dnf felt easy to use and rarely caused problems.
While we worked on other cloud-native projects, our users consistently highlighted several common pain points.
This realization prompted us to tackle the larger issue of package management in Kubernetes, leading to the development of Glasskube.</p>
