For young men in particular, it's an enticing, if a bit troubling, prospect. But for a variety of companies, from sportsbooks to investing apps, an increased willingness to make some kind of gamble means business is booming. The boys-who-like-to-bet bank is open, and companies are making as many withdrawals as they can.</p><p>The level at which gambling has become normalized in the United States in recent years is stunning. Americans legally bet a record $119.84 billion on sports in 2023, up from $93 billion in 2022. Since the Supreme Court in 2018 struck down a federal law prohibiting sports gambling, more than three dozen states have embraced it in some form. Seven states have also legalized iGaming, meaning online blackjack, roulette, and slot machines.</p><p>And while not explicitly gambling, free trading apps such as Robinhood have gotten <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-investing-outlook-day-trading-risks-threats-peter-tchir-2020-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">an increasing number of ordinary people</a> into investing — for fun, to alleviate boredom, to try to make some extra cash. While many people have used the apps to build a stable portfolio, a good chunk of people are doing high-risk day trading or piling into meme stocks like GameStop, AMC, or, as Donald Trump's people are hoping, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-media-stock-price-crash-spac-djt-truth-social-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">his newly public social-media company</a>. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-all-time-high-etfs-crypto-price-crash-boom-bust-2024-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Crypto is back again</a>, and this time around, almost nobody is pretending the endeavor is about anything other than "number go up." Many<a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/esrb-cracks-down-on-microtransactions-what-it-means-for-you-2018-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""> video games have a gambling-like aspect</a>, too, that gets kids and adolescents into the risk-minded pipeline.</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><p>While plenty of people across demographics are participating in these trends, data suggests the crowds skew younger and male. A 2023 survey from the NCAA found that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sports-betting-apps-online-gambling-lottery-draftkings-fanduel-2024-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">sports gambling was prevalent</a> among young adults, specifically on college campuses and among Black and Latino respondents. Pew Research found in 2022 that men and people under 50 were likelier to bet on sports than women and the over-50 crowd. Younger men tend to be more into crypto and meme-stock trading as well.</p><p>This isn't surprising. Men tend to take more financial risks than women. As investors, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-men-and-women-invest-2015-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">they're more prone to overconfidence</a>, which often leads them to trade more — and, as a result, get lower returns. Men generally <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-sports-betting-fantasy-games-taking-over-college-campuses-2024-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">gamble more than women</a>, and they've been found to have lower levels of impulsive coping in gambling settings.</p><p>The precise reason for this behavior is hard to pin down, said Timothy Fong, a clinical professor of psychiatry at UCLA and the codirector of its gambling-studies program. There's a cultural component: In the '80s, young men were fed movies like "Wall Street," shown flashy cars and money, and told that greed is good. In the '90s and early 2000s, they were sold on more traditional forms of gambling and poker. Now they're being marketed sports betting and crypto. But it also goes deeper than that.</p><p>"For years, when we've studied gambling behaviors as well as other addictive behaviors, the trend has always been males more than females are impacted," Fong said. "People have said, well, is that a biological risk? Is that a culturally driven risk? Is that a psychological risk or a social risk factor? And basically, what I can say is that it's probably a combination."</p><p>There may be FOMO, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-are-investing-crypto-stocks-because-of-fomo-survey-2023-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">as in fear of missing out</a>. Younger men see their friends playing in crypto or betting on sports, and they want to join in. Many of them have income they're not doing more productive things with, especially in the wake of a pandemic that has a lot of consumers who were once trying to save up thinking, "Eh, screw it." Maybe 40 years ago a 28-year-old had a mortgage and a family to support. Now he doesn't have those responsibilities and can direct disposable income toward whichever stock he just saw recommended on Reddit or a bet on whether the next pitch in a baseball game will be a ball or a strike.</p><es-blockquote data-styles="pullquote-breakout" data-quote="For years, when we've studied gambling behaviors as well as other addictive behaviors, the trend has always been males more than females are impacted" data-quote-updated="true" data-source="Add source (optional)" data-source-updated="false">

                            </es-blockquote><p>Kahlil Philander, a Washington State University professor who focuses on public policy and gambling, said this gambling boom is being compounded by a novelty effect. Many <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-gen-z-and-millennials-view-sports-betting-study-2021-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">young people are being exposed to gambling </a>for the first time. and a wide variety of products are being marketed aggressively to them. All the advertising dollars that have been spent on sports-betting platforms and crypto exchanges, for example, have amplified the exposure effect. The other part of the story is that many of these people haven't gambled before: Unlike a 60-year-old who's been there, done that, they haven't internalized the downsides.</p><p>"If there are risks or risk-mitigating strategies that individuals can take, they might not have learned those lessons yet," Philander said. "That can lead to higher levels of involvement, more harmful activity, all the types of things that people with more experience might have figured out for themselves one way or another."</p><p>At the heart of this is technology is the idea that guys don't have to walk over to the casino to place a bet or call a broker to trade a stock&nbsp;— they can just take out their phones.</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><p>"The technology that brings us that intersection between gambling, gaming, investing, and financial risk, that technology barrier is so low right now," Fong said.</p><p>For some young men, a level of nihilism about the economy leads to an impetus to take some risks. It shows up in movies like "Dumb Money," about the GameStop phenomenon, or "This Is Not Financial Advice," a documentary about dogecoin where the protagonists are portrayed as Davids against Goliaths — hedge funds, but also the economic system at large.</p><p>"We're at a place as a society where there are many new forms of gambling where the nature of investing and financial risk-taking is much different than it was before," Philander said.</p><p>The billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has a penchant for <a target="_blank" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/warren-buffett-bitcoin-gambling-token-crypto-market-outlook-berkshire-hathaway-2023-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">doing some finger-wagging</a> from time to time, described <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-letter-munger-berkshire-annual-shareholder-stock-speculation-ai-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">the shifting nature of investing</a> in his latest letter to Berkshire Hathaway investors.</p><p>"For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young," he wrote. "The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupants."</p><p>Along with the rise of new customers, problem-gambling behavior is increasing, especially among young men. A 2023 report on the prevalence of gambling in New Jersey — where sports betting and online gambling are legal, and where Atlantic City is — found that men had double the rate of high-risk problem gambling than women and that those ages 18 to 44 were at the highest risk. The New Jersey report identified a significant prevalence of high-risk stock trading among young men. In the state, which pushed to have the federal law prohibiting sports betting overturned, calls to its problem-gambling hotline tripled in five years, with people 25 to 34 being the likeliest to reach out.</p><es-blockquote data-styles="pullquote-right" data-quote="The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupants" data-quote-updated="true" data-source="Warren Buffett" data-source-updated="true">

According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, some 2.5 million Americans have a severe gambling problem, and another 5 million to 8 million have a problem it considers mild or moderate. That's a small sliver of the population. Plenty of people do some amount of betting and eventually fall off, or they dip in from time to time and are just fine. The public's interest in crypto ebbs and flows, and just because someone got into meme stocks for a while doesn't mean they're living on <a target="_blank" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/3-meme-stocks-that-r-wallstreetbets-loves-but-shouldnt-1033148653" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Wall Street Bets</a> forever.</p><p>Still, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-us-sports-betting-is-changing-media-companies-partnerships-ma-2021-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">explosion of playing so much with money</a> in the US is worrying, especially without a lot going on in the way of regulations, education, or safeguards to keep problem gambling in check. At least a sports-betting app will nudge someone to slow down if they go too far — there are virtually no protections in place if your day-trading habit gets out of hand, and many people don't even realize that what they're doing really is gambling.

"And that's it."</p><p>Casinos, sportsbooks, and trading platforms want to make money off bettors, and the way to do that is to get them to play more, not less.

<h2 id="what-are-we-even-doing">What are we even doing?</h2>

<h2 id="why-build-a-weather-data-warehouse">Why build a weather data warehouse?</h2>

<p>I think it would be cool to have historical weather data from around the world to analyze for signals of climate change we’ve <em>already</em> had rather than think about potential future change.</p>

<p>If we had a huge weather data warehouse we could query it to figure out whether Jakarta is actually warmer or stormier these days and exactly how is it warmer (heat waves, winter highs, etc.). Or whether Chile is warming or getting cloudier as a whole, which could be region-specific. We could do this kind of analysis for every city or region on Earth to find out which places have already experienced the most climate change and what kind of change.</p>

<p>But to do this analysis globally we need to make querying the data warehouse fast, and there’s a lot of data. The first step is to load the data into a database of some kind. I’m going to try using PostgreSQL here. It should be a good learning experience and using TimescaleDB to speed up time-based queries and eventually PostGIS to speed up geospatial queries seems promising.</p>

<p>To get there though we first need to load all this data into Postgres and this is what this post is about. Initial attempts at loading the data seemed slow so I wanted to investigate how to do this fast, leading me down a rabbit hole and me writing this.<sup id="fnref:postgres-guide" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:postgres-guide" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Are we building a data warehouse? I think so…? Is a relational database even appropriate for gridded weather data? No idea but we’ll find out.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-data">What’s the data?</h2>

<p>We are not working with actual weather observations. They are great, but can be sparse in certain regions especially in the past. Instead, we will be working with the ERA5 climate reanalysis product<sup id="fnref:era5-explanation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:era5-explanation" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. It’s our best estimate of the historical state of the Earth’s weather and is widely used in weather and climate research.</p>

<p>The data is output from a climate model run that is constrained to match weather observations. So where we have lots of weather observations, ERA5 should match it closely. And where we do not have any weather observations, ERA5 will be physically consistent and should match the climatology, i.e. the simulated weather’s statistics should match reality. At the top of this page is a snapshot of what global surface temperature looks like and below is a snapshot of global precipitation.</p>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/precipitation_figure.png" alt="global precipitation snapshot"></p>

  <figcaption>Global snapshot of precipitation rate at 2018-12-04 04:00:00 UTC.</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Here’s what a time series of temperature looks like at one location.</p>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/zoom_plot_temperature_Durban.png" alt="temperature time series"></p>

  <figcaption>Time series of surface temperature near Durban, South Africa.</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>ERA5 covers the entire globe at 0.25 degree resolution, and stretches back in time to 1940 with hourly resolution. Hourly data stretching back to 1940 is 727,080 snapshots in time for each variable like temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed, etc. A regularly-spaced latitude-longitude grid at 0.25 degree resolution has 1,038,240 grid points or locations (1440 longitudes and 721 latitudes including both poles). Together that’s 753,836,544,000 or ~754 billion rows of data if indexed by time and location. That’s a good amount of data. And as I found out, it’s not trivial to quickly shove this data into a relational database, much less be able to query it quickly.</p>

<p>The ERA5 data is distributed as NetCDF<sup id="fnref:netcdf-explanation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:netcdf-explanation" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> files. You can query an API for the data or download it from certain providers but generally each file contains data for a day, a month, or a year. This chunking by time makes it quick and easy to query the dataset at single points in time, but looking at temporal patterns is very slow as many files need to be read to pull out a single time series. It takes like 20~30 minutes to pull out temperature data for one location to make the plot above! Complex geospatial queries, especially over time, will be slow and difficult to perform. Packages like <a href="https://xarray.dev/">xarray</a> and <a href="https://www.dask.org/">dask</a> (and efforts by <a href="https://pangeo.io/">Pangeo</a>) speed things up but it’s still a slow process.</p>

<p>We’ll just load in temperature, zonal and meridional wind speeds, total cloud cover, precipitation, and snowfall for each time and location so we’ll use this table schema:</p>

<pre><code>create table weather (
    time timestamptz not null,
    location_id int,
    latitude float4,
    longitude float4,
    temperature_2m float4,
    zonal_wind_10m float4,
    meridional_wind_10m float4,
    total_cloud_cover float4,
    total_precipitation float4,
    snowfall float4
);
</code></pre>

<p>And before you mention database normalization, yes I have both a <code>location_id</code> column and <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code> columns. It’s for later benchmarking with queries and indexes.</p>

<h2 id="the-insert-statement">The <code>insert</code> statement</h2>

<h2 id="starting-with-just-the-single-row-insert-statement">Starting with just the single-row <code>insert</code> statement</h2>

<p>The simplest way to load data into a table is by using the <code>insert</code> command to insert a single row. This looks something like</p>

<pre><code>insert into weather (
    time,
    location_id,
    latitude,
    longitude,
    temperature_2m,
    zonal_wind_10m,
    meridional_wind_10m,
    total_cloud_cover,
    total_precipitation,
    snowfall
) values ('1995-03-10 16:00:00+00', 346441, -30, 30.25, 15.466888,
          -2.0585022, 0.25202942, 0.9960022, 0.007845461, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>and so you can just loop over all the data doing this row-by-row. Unfortunately it is quite slow as quite a bit goes on behind the scenes here:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Postgres needs to parse the statement, validate table and column names, and plan the best way to execute it.</li>
  <li>Postgres may need to lock the table to ensure data integrity.<sup id="fnref:mvcc-explanation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mvcc-explanation" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></li>
  <li>The data is written to a buffer as Postgres uses a write-ahead logging<sup id="fnref:wal-explanation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wal-explanation" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> (or WAL) system.</li>
  <li>Data from the buffer is actually inserted into the table on disk (which may involve navigating through and updating indexes, but we won’t have any here).</li>
  <li>If the <code>insert</code> statement is part of a transaction<sup id="fnref:transaction-explanation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:transaction-explanation" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> that is committed, then the changes are made permanent.</li>
</ol>

<p>So there’s a lot of overhead associated with inserting single rows, especially if each <code>insert</code> gets its own transaction.</p>

<p>How many rows can we actually insert per second using single-row inserts? After loading the data from NetCDF into a pandas dataframe I found three<sup id="fnref:orm-explanation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:orm-explanation" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> ways to insert the data into Postgres from Python so let’s benchmark all three:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>pandas</strong>: You can insert data straight from a dataframe using the <code>df.to_sql()</code> function with the <code>chunksize=1</code> keyword argument to force single-row inserts.</li>
  <li><strong>psycopg3</strong>: You can use <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/basic/params.html">parameterized queries</a> to protect against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection</a>, not that it’s a risk here (yet) but it’s good to practice safety I guess. All inserts are part of one transaction that is committed at the end.</li>
  <li><strong>SQLAlchemy</strong>: You can similarly use named parameters in a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection attacks.</li>
</ol>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/benchmarks_insert.png" alt="single-row insert benchmarks"></p>

  <figcaption>
    Blue bars show the median insert rate into a regular PostgreSQL table, while orange bars show the median insert rate into a TimescaleDB hypertable. Each benchmark inserted 20k rows and was repeated 10 times. The error bars show the range of insert rates given by the 10th and 90th percentiles.
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>I benchmarked inserting into a regular Postgres table and a TimescaleDB hypertable<sup id="fnref:hypertable-explanation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hypertable-explanation" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Pandas and psycopg3 perform similarly, with a slight edge to psycopg3. SQLAlchemy is the slowest even though we’re not using its ORM tool. This may be because it introduces extra overhead with its abstractions around session management and compiled SQL expressions.</p>

<p>Inserting into a Timescale hypertable is a bit slower. This is maybe because rows are being inserted into a hypertable with chunks so there may be some overhead there, even if there’s only one chunk.</p>

<p>So at best we’re only getting ~3000 inserts per second with single-row inserts at which rate we’re gonna have to wait ~8 years for all the data to load 🦥 There must be a faster way.</p>

<h2 id="multi-valued-insert">Multi-valued <code>insert</code></h2>

<p>You can insert multiple rows with one <code>insert</code> statement. This is called a multi-valued or bulk insert and looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>insert into weather (
    time,
    location_id,
    latitude,
    longitude,
    temperature_2m,
    zonal_wind_10m,
    meridional_wind_10m,
    total_cloud_cover,
    total_precipitation,
    snowfall
) values
    ('1995-03-02 04:00:00+00', 346444, -30, 31, 21.54013,
     7.1091003, 5.9887085, 1, 2.7820282, 0),
    ('1995-03-02 05:00:00+00', 346444, -30, 31, 21.596466,
     7.0369415, 6.2397766, 0.95751953, 2.1944494, 0),
    ('1995-03-02 06:00:00+00', 346444, -30, 31, 21.660583,
     6.303482, 6.017273, 0.88571167, 1.9253268, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>This is faster for a few reasons. There’s less network overhead as each single-row insert requires a network round trip for each row inserted. Postgres also only has to parse and plan once. Multi-row inserts can also be further optimized when it comes to updating indexes. It seems that you can bulk insert as many rows as you want as long as they fit in memory.</p>

<p>In pandas it sounds like you can do this by passing the <code>method="multi"</code> keyword argument to the <code>df.to_sql()</code> function but I found this to be a bit slower than single-row inserts with <code>chunksize=1</code>. So I just didn’t set a method or chunk size and supposedly all rows will be written at once, and it was faster. With psycopg3 you can construct or stream a list of tuples, one for each row, and insert them all at once. With SQLAlchemy it’s a dict of tuples.</p>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/benchmarks_multi_insert.png" alt="multi-valued insert benchmarks"></p>

  <figcaption>This time each benchmark inserted 100k rows and was repeated 10 times.</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Now there’s a clear winner with psycopg3 at 25~30k inserts/sec. I’m not sure why psycopg3 is faster but it looks like pandas is <a href="https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/a671b5a8bf5dd13fb19f0e88edc679bc9e15c673/pandas/io/sql.py#L938-L968">using dictionaries to insert</a> which can be slower than just plain tuples. SQLAlchemy might be extra slow slow here because of additional overhead like with single-row inserts and I also passed it dictionaries.</p>

<p>With multi-row inserts there’s an order-of-magnitude improvement but at ~30k inserts per second, we’re still gonna have to wait ~0.8 years or almost 10 months for all the data to load 🐢</p>

<h2 id="the-copy-statement">The <code>copy</code> statement</h2>

<h2 id="upgrading-to-the-copy-statement">Upgrading to the <code>copy</code> statement</h2>

<p>For loading in larger amounts of data, Postgres has the <code>copy</code> statement allowing us to insert rows from a CSV file or from a binary file.<sup id="fnref:copy-binary-note" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:copy-binary-note" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> <code>copy</code> is faster than multi-row inserts as Postgres reads data straight from the file and optimizes parsing, planning, and WAL usage knowing there is a lot of data to load.</p>

<p>Once you have a CSV file it’s as simple as</p>

<pre><code>copy weather from some_big.csv delimiter ',' csv header;
</code></pre>

<p>We have the option of saving data from NetCDF files as CSV files then using <code>copy</code>. This honestly feels inefficient as saving timestamps and floating-point numbers as plaintext to disk takes up more space that it should then reading it from disk seems like it would be slow, but Postgres seems to have optimized this operation. We also have the option of not saving the data into CSV files and streaming it straight into Postgres using psycopg3’s <code>cusor.copy()</code> function.</p>

<p>When benchmarking <code>copy</code> vs. <code>psycopg3.cursor.copy()</code> we are starting with a pandas dataframe so we must account for the time it takes to save all the data to CSV files on disk in the case of <code>copy csv</code>. In the case of <code>cursor.copy()</code> if we stream a list of tuples then the only overhead is creating the cursor and tuple generator.</p>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/benchmarks_copy.png" alt="copy benchmarks"></p>

  <figcaption>
    Here the full rate includes overhead (writing CSV files or constructing tuples) while the copy rate does not. This time each benchmark inserted 1,038,240 rows (1 day of ERA5 data) and was repeated 10 times.
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>We see that <code>copy</code> can actually insert close to 400k rows per second, but that is if you already have the CSV file ready to go. Including overhead, both <code>copy</code> and psycopg3 can manage around 100k inserts/second with psycopg3 being a bit faster. For some reason there seems to be no difference between regular table and hypertable performance for psycopg3.</p>

<p>At ~100k inserts/second we’re still talking about ~3 months to load all the data 🐌</p>

<h2 id="sustaining-copy-insert-rates">Sustaining <code>copy</code> insert rates</h2>

<p>When inserting <em>many</em> rows, Postgres may encounter bottlenecks<sup id="fnref:write-bottlenecks" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:write-bottlenecks" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> so it’s important that the insert rate can be sustained. To look at this, we can insert hundreds of millions of rows and watch for fluctuations in the insert rate.</p>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/benchmarks_copy_at_scale.png" alt="copy at scale benchmarks"></p>

  <figcaption>
    For this benchmark, rows were inserted in 744 batches of 1,038,240 rows for a total of ~772 million rows. The overall insert rate is plotted. The dots show the insert rate for each batch while the solid lines show a 10-batch rolling mean. The straight horizontal lines show the mean insert rate over the entire benchmark. Note that the lines orange and blue straight lines are right on top of each other.
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>It seems that, at least with one worker, we don’t see huge drops in insert rates although <code>copy csv</code> shows frequent drops and seems more susceptible to fluctuations. psycopg3 is generally faster and interestingly there isn’t much of a difference between copying into a regular table or hypertable.</p>

<h2 id="parallel-copy">Parallel <code>copy</code></h2>

<p>Inserting data with <code>copy</code> is fast but can we speed it up by executing multiple <code>copy</code> operations in parallel? Using the joblib package we can execute multiple <code>copy</code> statements or psycopg3 cursors in parallel.</p>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/benchmarks_parallel_copy.png" alt="parallel copy benchmarks"></p>

  <figcaption>
    The overall insert rate is plotted as a function of the number of workers. Each benchmark inserted 128 hours of ERA5 data (~133 million rows).
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Inserting data into a single table is not super parallelizable so it looks like performance generally plateaus after 16 workers.<sup id="fnref:better-parallel-benchmark" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:better-parallel-benchmark" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></p>



<h2 id="pg_bulkload-and-timescaledb-parallel-copy">pg_bulkload and timescaledb-parallel-copy</h2>

<p>Beyond the <code>copy</code> statement, there are external tools for loading large amounts of data into Postgres. I’ll benchmark two of them, <a href="https://github.com/ossc-db/pg_bulkload">pg_bulkload</a> and <a href="https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-parallel-copy">timescaledb-parallel-copy</a>.</p>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/benchmarks_tools.png" alt="tools benchmarks"></p>

  <figcaption>
    Blue and orange bars show results from benchmarks that inserted 1,038,240 rows (1 day of ERA5 data) and were repeated 10 times. The sustained insert rates are from benchmarks that inserted 256 hours of ERA5 data (~266 million rows) into a hypertable. In these benchmarks the CSV files were already written to disk so the insert rate corresponds to the "copy rate" from the copy benchmarks. The insert rate including overhead accounts for the time it takes to write the CSV files to disk.
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>At first it would seem that pg_bulkload is much faster, however, this is because by default it bypasses the shared buffers and skips WAL logging so data recovery following a crash may not be possible while timescaledb-parallel-copy does not and does things more safely. On a level playing field with <code>fsync</code> off (see next section for an explanation) timescaledb-parallel-copy with multiple workers beats out pg_bulkload.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-workers-with-timescaledb-parallel-copy">Multiple workers with timescaledb-parallel-copy</h2>

<p>timescaledb-parallel-copy lets you specify the number of workers inserting data in parallel. Let’s see how much performance we can squeeze out with more workers, and if that performance can be sustained.</p>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/benchmarks_parallel_tpc.png" alt="timescaledb-parallel-copy benchmarks"></p>

  <figcaption>
    The insert rate as a function of the number of rows inserted. In this benchmark the CSV files were already written to disk so the insert rate corresponds to the "copy rate" from the copy benchmarks. Each benchmark inserted 256 hours of ERA5 data (~266 million rows). Note the vertical log scale.
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Initial performance looks great! But eventually, before 100 million rows on my system, a bottleneck is reached and the insert rate tanks before picking back up in waves. The maximum sustained insert rate is around 600~700k inserts/sec for regular tables and ~300k for hypertables.</p>

<p>pg_bulkload doesn’t let you specify the number of threads or workers, but does have a <code>writer=parallel</code> option which uses multiple threads to do data reading, parsing and writing in parallel. We’ll look at its insert rate later.</p>

<h2 id="tweaking-postgres-settings">Tweaking Postgres settings</h2>

<p>There are a couple of other things we can try to speed up inserts, but are basically some form of tweaking <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/non-durability.html">Postgres’ non-durable settings</a>.</p>

<p>Some extra performance can be squeezed out of tweaking non-durable settings specifically for loading data following suggestions by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/12207237">Craig Ringer on StackOverflow</a>. Some of the settings can be dangerous for database integrity in the event of a crash though. The main settings to change are turning off <code>fsync</code> to avoid flushing data to disk and also turning off <code>full_page_writes</code> to avoid guarding against partial page writes.</p>

<p>You can also insert data into an unlogged table that generates no WAL and gets truncated upon crash recovery but is faster to write into. While inserting into an unlogged table might be fast, you still have to convert it to a regular logged table afterwards which can be a <a href="https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/195829">slow single-threaded process</a>. And hypertables cannot be unlogged, so if you want a hypertable you need to further convert/migrate the regular logged table to a hypertable which can also be slow.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-the-best-method">So what’s the best method?</h2>

<p><strong>Short answer: Use psycopg3 to directly copy data into a hypertable. If you already have CSV files then use timescaledb-parallel-copy. For parallelization the sweet spot seems to be 12~16 workers on my system.</strong></p>

<p>We want to end up with a hypertable but it seems like inserting into a regular table is faster. So is it faster to insert into a regular table then convert it to a hypertable? Or is it faster to just insert data straight into a hypertable?</p>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/conversion_time.png" alt="table conversion time"></p>

  <figcaption>
    Blue bars show the wall clock time taken to insert data into the table and the orange bar shows the time taken to convert the regular table into a hypertable.
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>A quick test with inserting ~772 million rows with psycopg3’s copy and 16 workers shows that inserting data into a hypertable is faster as it takes roughly 80% of the time in this case. This may not always be the case but inserting into a regular table then converting it to a hypertable and migrating the data will probably always be slower as the conversion/migration process is not super fast and seems to be single-threaded.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve concluded we want to be inserting data into a hypertable, let’s take a look at the all hypertable insert rates we’ve considered in one plot.</p>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/benchmarks_summary.png" alt="benchmarks summary"></p>

  <figcaption>
    Sustained hypertable insert rates including overhead (writing CSV files) for different insertion methods. Here "tpc" is short for timescaledb-parallel-copy and "pgb" is short for pg_bulkload. "32W" means 32 workers were used for that benchmark.
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>For pg_bulkload with a single worker the the <code>writer=buffered</code> option was used. For multiple workers, the <code>writer=buffered</code> and <code>multi_process=yes</code> options were used. Then for multiple workers with fsync off, the <code>writer=parallel</code> option was used.</p>

<p>So what can we conclude?</p>

<ol>
  <li>At least on my hardware it seems there’s a ceiling of ~140k sustained inserts/sec with overhead when using a single worker with protections on. pg_bulkload wins here by quite a bit.</li>
  <li>You can use multiple workers to increase the sustained insert rate up to ~250k inserts/sec with psycopg3’s copy cursor while still being protected.</li>
  <li>The insertion process is not very parallelizable so the sweet spot is 4-16 workers. The benchmarks used 32 workers to maximize insert rates.</li>
  <li>If you’re okay living a bit dangerously you can turn off fsync and sustain an insert rate of ~462k inserts/sec with psycopg3! You’ll also squeeze out a bit more performance out of timescaledb-parallell-copy.</li>
  <li>Be careful when using pg_bulkload as it disables <code>fsync</code> by default.</li>
  <li>These conclusions assume you need to do extra work to convert data to CSV files which is why psycopg3 was the clear winner, although it does seem pretty fast. If you’re starting with CSV files timescaledb-parallel-copy is probably faster (and quicker to set up).</li>
</ol>

<p>Some closing thoughts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Want even faster inserts? You should probably upgrade your hardware. A nice enterprise-grade NvME SSD and lots of high-speed DDR5 RAM will help a lot. I used hardware that is roughly 5 years old so newer hardware should be able to easily beat these benchmarks.</li>
  <li>I know the general wisdom is to just dump this data into Snowflake or BigQuery and get fast analytics for relatively cheap. But I like working with my own hardware and learning this way. Plus I have no real budget for this project.</li>
  <li>I’d be curious how ClickHouse performs on these benchmarks. My impression is that it would probably be faster out of the box. But I want to learn PostgreSQL and like the fact that TimescaleDB is just a Postgres extension so I went with TimescaleDB.</li>
</ol>

<p>At a sustained ~462k inserts per second, we’re waiting ~20 days for our ~754 billion rows which is not bad I guess 🐨 It’s less time than it took me to write this post.</p>

<p>A small UK stock exchange called Aquis hosts their matching engine in the cloud. Crypto exchanges are all cloud-based too. What if the NYSE, CME and others followed? The NASDAQ is already thinking about this since 2021. Let’s evaluate about how HFTs would adapt, and how small-time traders could benefit.</p>



<h2>A brief intro to ULL (ultra low latency) trading infra</h2>



<p>ULL trading firms go to a lot of trouble to get their servers and switches within the same buildings as the exchanges they trade with to reduce latency. Some firms don’t even use layer 1 switches to be competitive. </p>



<p>Most major exchanges run out of public data centres, for example:</p>



<ul>
<li>The <strong>NASDAQ </strong>is in an Equinix facility called NY11 in Carteret, NJ</li>



<li>The <strong>CME </strong>is in a site called Aurora</li>



<li>The <strong>LME </strong>sits in a Digital Realty facility Brick Lane (London), and so on</li>
</ul>



<p>The <strong>NYSE</strong> runs out of a facility in <strong>Mahwah, NJ, </strong>and whilst not a public colo, you can still rent a rack there.</p>



<p>You’ll pay heavily for a rack in one of these data centres. Individual quant traders cannot simply deploy ULL strategies here, due to the difficulty of sourcing the right hardware and getting set up in a site. You could go to a provider like Pico, but good infra is half of the competitive advantage when trading ULL (the other half is writing the trading strategy in low-level code and deploying it before other HFTs).</p>



<p>It’s not unthinkable that these facilities migrate to the cloud (which is where Coinbase’s trading happens).</p>



<h2>Can I trade stocks at low latency myself?</h2>



<ol>
<li>Reach out to Equinix, get a rack in NY4 with 5kVA power and about 4 cross connects</li>



<li>Reach out to Arista and get a <a href="https://www.arista.com/en/products/7130-layer-1-network-switches-quick-look" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7130</a> low latency switch</li>



<li>Buy a Xilinx card that supports <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/x2-series/onload.html">Onload</a>, put it in a server, do this x2 for reliability</li>



<li>Buy a time server to handle PTP so you know exactly when the market opens</li>



<li>Become a member of the NYSE</li>



<li>Pay for market data</li>



<li>Get an Internet connection so you can connect your server to deploy strats</li>
</ol>



<p>You’re looking at six to seven figures of set up costs and about that in yearly running costs. In other words, it’s not happening. Similar pains will exist for trading FX with some bank like Citi, or futures with the CME.</p>



<h2>Low(ish) latency crypto</h2>



<p>Smart quant crypto traders will spin up many thousands of EC2 instances, measure latency to the exchange, and only keep the best instances, continually. This process allows them to eventually get EC2 instances to trade from probably in the same rack, or maybe on the same bare metal box, as the exchange. This is pretty good going. Traffic will still be routed through some sort of overlay network, but everyone has that penalty. There are no large upfront costs to setting up a strategy and market data is free.</p>



<h2>So, what happens if exchanges move?</h2>



<p>The NASDAQ is already bringing AWS infra into their facilities (<a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/nasdaq-to-migrate-to-aws-use-on-premise-data-center-as-private-aws-local-zone/">link</a>). So let’s say the NYSE went full cloud tomorrow with AWS – what happens?</p>



<h5>You’re already behind</h5>



<p>ULL leaders like Jump Trading, XTX and PDT Partners probably already thought this through, so will already be ahead of you. They’d immediately deploy the abovementioned gameplan to continually find the lowest latency boxes. They’d probably try some EKS instances and bare metal instances too, in case the matching engines are now containerized, or bare-metal-ized.</p>



<h5>Time-keeping</h5>



<p>If you’re on a VM, you’re probably getting time via the hypervisor, but is it accurate enough? If you have a great strategy that needs to buy and sell two stocks 100 nanos (ns) after the open, and you know you’re <mark>3 mics</mark> (µs) away from the matching engine, you may want to send those two trades at 09:29:59.99999<mark>7</mark><mark>1</mark> at the hope your order arrives at <mark>100ns</mark> past 9.30am. Since 2023, high-precision PTP has been available on some EC2 instances (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/11/amazon-time-sync-service-microsecond-accurate-time/">link</a>), so it’s likely you’d want to be on one of these boxes. Amazon says the accuracy is “within microseconds” so this could be problematic. A strategy could be to send multiple trades at 09:29:59.99999{…, 4,5,6} and see if they get filled, but this risks double-trading (and breaking the exchange’s rules) which may well itself affect the strategy’s alpha.</p>



<h5>Market data</h5>



<p>The NYSE might make it your problem to deal with recording data, or they may make an S3 bucket available to anyone who pays them. Anyways, you probably want to pipe that directly into the strategy at filesystem level from the virtual NIC, and secondarily into Kafka/RedPanda and into something like kdb+ or ClickHouse to look at later.</p>



<h5>Strats/alphas</h5>



<p>Next, the strats. All HDL-written code for FPGAs becomes irrelevant, and winning strategies would quickly be ported to C, compiled with some optimal compiler for wahtever CPU the VM/container/bare metal box chosen is running on. For example, Intel has Math Kernel Library, whilst AMD has their own called AOCL. Strategies may even need to be compiled with optimizations for both.</p>



<h5>Optimisations</h5>



<ol>
<li><strong>Running some more lightweight OS</strong> like an ultra-thinned down Debian guest might yield some advantages to stock EC2 instances. This would be at the trade-off of increasing the time to build VMs, which will almost always land up somewhere useless for latency purposes.</li>



<li><strong>Going to bare metal even when the exchange is on EC2</strong> might still be better if you could remove some crucial mics of hypervisor overhead. The create and kill game might need to be played with EC2 Bare Metal, and this may offend Amazon.</li>



<li><strong>Hogging instances</strong> might pay, if this stops competitors getting good hosts. This would eat into PnL and is also wasteful on energy.</li>
</ol>



<h5>Nasty stuff that might happen</h5>



<ol>
<li>Bad players could do a ping test to many thousands of EC2 instances, find those which are also at very low latency to their good boxes (assuming these are competitors), and DDoS them during trading hours to hammer the hypervisor’s NIC. This would result in critical overhead occurring for competitors sending orders out.</li>



<li>Bad players could also generate large bursts of traffic on good EC2 instances they control on hypervisors believed to be close to the exchange, but don’t plan to trade on, to achieve the same thing in a less blatantly offensive way (e.g. say 40 servers in a rack, you guesstimate which physical box your trading VM is on, but also try find VMs on the other 39 good servers, and just generate spam traffic to add overhead to the actual NICs).</li>
</ol>



<h5>Unsolved problems</h5>



<ol>
<li>How would you short <strong>AMZN</strong> stock if there was an outage on AWS? This is super convenient for Amazon.</li>
</ol>



<h2>Winners and losers</h2>



<p>Smaller quant shops and sophisticated home traders are the winners, whilst professional HFTs would be losers due to their sophisticated hardware advantages becoming worthless.</p>



<p>Equinix is also a loser, and obviously Amazon is the biggest winner overall.</p>



<h2>Why did Aquis move?</h2>



<ol>
<li><strong>They probably can’t differentiate massively </strong>with LSEG or Euronext (who have way bigger tech spend), so being cloud-based is something different to do.</li>



<li><strong>AWS might have given them a good deal </strong>versus a colo, since Aquis doesn’t command the same sway someone like NYSE does to bless Equinix with a <s>cash cow</s> dairy farm.</li>



<li><strong>The UK is an HFT-hostile country</strong> (due to share trading taxes) where most UK ULL trading is on swaps and CFDs anyways, so they have little to lose by angering the HFTs by levelling the playing field.</li>
</ol>

<p>In a major clean energy benchmark, wind, solar, and hydro exceeded 100% of demand on California’s main grid for 30 of the past 38 days.</p>



<p>Stanford University professor of civil and environmental engineering Mark Z. Jacobson has been tracking California’s renewables performance, and he shares his findings on Twitter (X) when the state breaks records. Yesterday he posted:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Jacobson notes that supply exceeds demand for “0.25-6 h per day,” and that’s an important fact. The continuity lies not in renewables running the grid for the entire day but in the fact that it’s happening on a consistent daily basis, which has never been achieved before.</p>



<p>At the two-week record mark, Ian Magruder at Rewiring America made this great point <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ianmagruder_this-is-getting-so-easy-its-almost-boring-activity-7176053666829762561-3UgW/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">on LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>And what makes it even better is that California has the largest grid-connected battery storage facility in the world (<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/01/25/us-largest-solar-battery-storage-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came online in January</a> …), meaning those batteries were filling up with excess energy from the sun all afternoon today and are now deploying as we speak to offset a good chunk of the methane gas generation that California still uses overnight.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On April 2, the California Independent System Operator (ISO) recommended 26 new transmission projects worth $6.1 billion, with a big number being devoted to offshore wind.</p>




	<p>In response, Jacobson predicted <a href="https://twitter.com/mzjacobson/status/1775902563310899254">on April 4</a> that California will entirely be on renewables and battery storage 24/7 by 2035. </p>



<p>California passed a law that commits to achieving 100% net zero electricity by 2045. Will it beat that goal by a decade? We hope so. It’s going to be exciting to watch.</p>

<h2>A Curious Phenomenon Called ‘Etak’</h2>



<p>Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything. Or so said Steve Jobs when he announced iPhone in 2007.</p>



<p>But I’m talking about a different revolutionary product. A foundational product that forever changed how everyone on this planet gets to where they need to be.  </p>



<p>Today, I’d like to tell you about the Etak Navigator, a truly revolutionary product and the world’s first practical vehicle navigation system.</p>



<p>Here’s a picture of it:</p>

<p>At the time, it was considered out-of-this-world. This is what Silicon Valley’s San Jose Mercury News said about it:</p>

<p>Back in 1985 you used paper maps to navigate, like this one from a Thomas Brother’s map of Los Angeles:</p>

<p>As you can see, the maps weren’t always pretty. By today’s standards it was also supremely difficult and tedious to find locations and even more difficult to work out how to get there.</p>



<p>So, when the Etak Navigator launched, it was like something from the future.</p>

<p>It immediately got tons of press, including the front cover of Popular Science:</p>

<p>Nearly everything about the Etak Navigator had to be conceived from scratch.</p>



<p>Most important was the self contained positioning system. Remember that back in 1985 GPS was not available (see “<a href="https://maphappenings.com/2024/03/14/where-art-thou/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12 Map Happenings that Rocked our World: Part 8 — Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?</a>“)</p>



<p>Before GPS, navigation systems used a technique called ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dead reckoning</a>‘. Dead reckoning relied on sensors to determine distance traveled and direction of travel. However, no sensor is perfect. As a result the further you travel the greater the errors build. Pretty quickly you have no idea where you are.</p>



<p>To solve this problem Etak invented ‘augmented dead reckoning’. This used a process to match the position given by the navigation sensors to a topologically correct electronic map. Whenever the vehicle turned you made the assumption that you’re driving on a road. At that point the location could be ‘snapped’ back to the road and the error from the sensors could be reset. This technique was later adopted by all navigation apps and is still in use today. </p>



<p>Like all attempts at building a navigation system before it, without this key invention the Etak Navigator would have failed.</p>



<p>The second key invention was a ‘heading up’, moving map display.  This meant that the vehicle remained at the center of the screen and the map moved and turned under the vehicle. What you saw ahead of you in the windshield was what was displayed on the screen. This proved highly intuitive.</p>



<p>Third: the Etak Navigator was also the first consumer device to introduce the concept of address search, or what the geospatial industry has come to call ‘geocoding’.</p>

<p>Here is a clip from the only video I could find of the Etak Navigator in action:&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As you can see the map moves and turns as the vehicle drives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The buttons on the right control the zoom level which is denoted as the number of miles between the vehicle symbol and the top of the screen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The top of the screen shows the current zoom level, the heading to the destination, the number of miles to the destination as the crow flies, and which way is north.</p>



<p>The address search allowed entry of destination by address, street or intersection.&nbsp;You could also store common locations like home and work.</p>

<p>The Etak Navigator had twelve buttons, six on each side of the screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the screen below you can see how street names were entered. Note how any letter or digit could easily be entered with just two button pushes. Also, you only had to enter the first few letters of a street name:</p>

<p>This is the Etak Navigator in navigation mode:</p>

<p>Note that the Etak Navigator did not provide turn-by-turn directions. Instead you simply zoomed out the map to see your destination, shown as a flashing star. As you got closer to the destination you zoomed in revealing more of the local roads. You had to use your own noggin to determine the most appropriate road to take.</p>



<p>The lack of turn-by-turn navigation did not prove to be an issue. I know from much personal experience that the system worked very well!</p>







<h2>Etak Navigator System Details</h2>



<p>There were five key components to the Etak Navigator:</p>

<p>The first was a vector CRT display — similar to what you might find in an oscilloscope.</p>



<p>The navigation app and data were stored on cassette tape. The cassette tape drive was specially developed to read the tape at very high speed. In a music player a cassette tape is read at about 5cm (1 and 7/8″) per second. The cassette tape in an Etak Navigator was read at about 200cm (80″) per second!</p>



<p>There was an electronic compass installed on rear window of the vehicle.</p>



<p>To determine distance traveled and to augment the heading info from the compass, magnetic wheel sensors were installed on the un-driven wheels of the vehicle. This involved sticking special magnetic tape on the inside of the wheels and mounting magnetic sensors on the brake calipers.</p>



<p>Finally there was metal box about the size of a shoe box that contained the CPU and motherboard. This was installed in the trunk.</p>



<p>The cassette tapes stored both the navigation app and the map data. The maps were called “Etak Maps”. It took 6 tapes to cover the San Francisco Bay Area:</p>

<p>The original price for the Etak Navigator was US$1,395:</p>

<p>That’s the equivalent of about US$4,000 today.</p>



<p>On top of the cost of the Navigator there was an expensive installation cost: it took an experienced technician about 4 hours to install the whole system.</p>







<h2>Just Some of the Technical Hurdles</h2>



<p>Back in 1985 there were huge technical constraints.</p>



<p>GPS barely existed. In those days the government prevented anyone but the military getting more than 100 meter accuracy. And GPS receivers were both large and expensive.</p>



<p>In addition there were no large capacity interchangeable media. Floppy disks couldn’t store enough information and CD-ROM technology was brand new and too costly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most important problem to solve was overcoming inertial navigation error from the wheel sensors and the compass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here the solution was topological map matching.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This invention, above all others, made the product viable.</p>

<p>Another issue was data storage and latency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cassette tapes only held 3.5 megabytes and had 10 second average seek times.</p>



<p>The dev team had to invent a way of storing the 2D map on a one dimensional medium, making sure that regions close by on the map were also close by on the tape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Years later, when hard drives became cheaper and CD-ROMs became more readily available Etak’s highly efficient map data storage algorithm paid off in spades and resulted in very high performance maps.</p>

<p>Another problem was heat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users commonly left tapes on their dashboards and obviously dashboards can get very, very hot.</p>



<p>You can see from the tests that not all brands of cassette tape did very well:</p>

<p>However, a brand that worked was finally found. It had a shell made of polycarbonate.</p>



<p>Yet another problem was dealing with inclines.</p>



<p>The map had no elevation information and so if you were traveling up or down a hill errors would be compounded in the system as the distance traveled on the road was not equal to the distance traveled on the map.</p>



<p>To compensate we therefore needed to know the slope of the hill. To compute this Etak’s lead hardware engineer invented a special inclinometer that used fluid and a capacitive sensor. In tests on various fluids he found that Tequila worked quite well!</p>

<p>Another problem were magnetic anomalies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bridges can be highly magnetic and can really throw off a compass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The positioning algorithm therefore had to recognize these anomalies. When an anomaly was detected the positioning instead relied on the different speeds of the wheels to determine changes in direction. It wasn’t quite machine learning, but at the time it seemed pretty close!</p>



<p>The system also had to compensate for the magnetic fields generated by the rear window defroster.</p>

<p>In 1985 there wasn’t the luxury of 25 billion transistors and an M3 chip.</p>



<p>Instead the system relied on an Intel 8088 CPU which had 8-bits, ran at 5MHz and only had 29,000 transistors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus every line of code had to be incredibly efficient. It was all written in C, except for key parts of the OS kernel which were written in assembly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What about the digital map?</p>



<p>Etak had to create it — more or less from scratch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Originally Etak thought it could get maps from the government. Back then the US Census Bureau had something called <a href="https://www.census.gov/history/www/innovations/technology/dual_independent_map_encoding.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GBF DIME files</a> (which predated <a href="https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TIGER</a>). But they were stick maps and didn’t contain any shape to the roads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Etak therefore embarked on a massive program to build a map of key metropolitan areas across the US and later in Europe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To reposition the GBF/DIME files and give them some shape we used 1:24,000 scale United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps, otherwise knowns as ‘USGS quads’ as a reference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each map was photographed onto 10” transparencies and then scanned using a very expensive drum scanner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The entire map production program was developed and ran on a single VAX minicomputer.&nbsp;This blazing machine had 2MB RAM and two 400MB hard drives. It cost about US$120,000 in today’s dollars.</p>



<p>This little devil was burdened with a mammoth set of tasks. It supported:</p>



<ul>
<li>4 map digitizing workstations&nbsp;</li>



<li>The engineers developing and compiling code&nbsp;</li>



<li>Batch jobs to process and compile all the map data&nbsp;</li>



<li>The company admins who used it for word processing</li>
</ul>

<p>A dumb monochrome terminal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You edited code using the ‘vi’ editor. Sometimes you waited an hour for your programs to compile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The jobs to process the map data took up to two weeks to run … which was longer the the mean time between failure for the VAX mini-computer. The engineers used to joke that they should run the long jobs only immediately after a hardware failure had been fixed (knowing full well they were uttering a statistical fallacy).</p>



<p>The map digitizing environment was also revolutionary:</p>

<p>Each digitizing workstation was comprised of a PC clone with an 8-bit color graphics card and a 19” monitor. Initially there were four workstations which were manned by three shifts a day. Later this grew to 36 workstations. Etak digitized maps 24 hours a day, 5 days a week and 8 hours a day on weekends. </p>



<p>The map editing system was the first ever to use ‘heads up’ digitizing and was a huge trade secret at the time. It was so secret that the methodology was never patented and the digitizing environment was walled off from prying eyes — especially from the CEO of a particular company called ‘<a href="http://www.esri.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Environmental Systems Research Institute</a>‘ — i.e. a gentleman called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dangermond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack Dangermond</a> who I’m sure would have leapt at the chance to borrow the concept. 😉</p>



<p>Before this invention people used to digitize ‘blind’ using digitizing tablets which was highly inefficient and error prone.</p>



<p>Etak’s map production system leveraged the eight bits of the color graphics card very efficiently. 5 bits were used to display the scan of the USGS quad in greyscale and the other 3 bits were used to display the digitized map on top.&nbsp;The system was used to reposition the GBF/DIME files as well as to digitize new roads and edit road attributes like street names and addresses:</p>

<h2>The Amazing Team Behind It</h2>



<p>Etak was founded in 1983 by a truly amazing engineer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Honey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stan </a><a href="https://computerhistory.org/profile/stan-honey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Honey</a>.</p>



<p>Stan was already a world renown sailor. More importantly he was a world class navigator and had already beaten many sailing records across the Pacific by relying on his navigation skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before founding Etak, Stan was a research engineer at <a href="http://sri.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SRI International</a> in Menlo Park, California.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stan has gone on to do many things. His most recent achievement was as the director of technology for the America’s Cup sailing races where he developed a system to track the America’s Cup boats to within 2cm, five times per second!</p>

<p>The original idea for Etak came when Stan Honey and a serial entrepreneur, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Bushnell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nolan Bushnell</a>, were on a sailing boat together. Nolan had hired Stan to navigate his racing yacht through the 1983 Transpacific Yacht Race, a prestigious sailing event that spanned 2,225 nautical miles of open ocean from Los Angeles to Honolulu.</p>



<p>Nolan was famous for inventing the first video game, Pong, and later for founding Atari.</p>

<p>The story is recounted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjedwards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Benj Edwards</a> in his fantastic article for Fast Company: “<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3047828/who-needs-gps-the-forgotten-story-of-etaks-amazing-1985-car-navigation-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Who Needs GPS? The  Forgotten Story of Etak’s Amazing 1985 Car Navigation System</a>“:</p>







<blockquote>
<p>[Early one morning Stan and Nolan were on night watch together.] They began brainstorming about a computer-based navigation system for use on land. Stan thought a navigation system for automobiles could operate based on dead reckoning and comparing one’s current location to known points on a map, a technique known as map matching. It wouldn’t need satellites at all, just a good digital map, a good compass, and some sensors. Then it could display the result on an electronic screen.</p>



<p>Nolan reaction:&nbsp; “Yeah, let’s do that and I’ll fund it”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nolan always had an appreciation for where consumer technology might eventually go. In an interview for Inc. magazine in 1984 he said “Let’s say you’re in your car, and you want to go to dinner. You’ve got this box on the dash. You punch in ‘Japanese,’ then ‘cheap,’ then ‘good sushi.’ The box takes over and guides you to a place.”  </p>



<p>One of Etak’s key hires was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marv-white-99945114/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marv White</a>. Marv was a map scientist and mathematician and worked at the US Census Bureau on their mapping program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under Marv’s direction Etak’s map digitizing productivity was three times the industry standard.&nbsp;Since leaving Etak, Marv has gone on to many exciting ventures, including a period as Chief Technologist for Innovation at ESPN.</p>

<p>There were many other supremely talented engineers behind the Navigator, many of whom previously worked at SRI International: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-milnes-6206356/">Ken Milnes</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-loughmiller-9a09a95/">George Loughmiller</a> and Alan Philips to name a few. </p>



<p>Many of the original hires at Etak went on to other mapping organizations, including yours truly. When I worked on the Apple Maps team, 12 of my colleagues were Etak alumni.</p>

<h2>So What Happened to Etak?</h2>



<p>The Etak Navigator was about 20 years ahead of its time. Due to the cost of the hardware and the expensive installation process building a sustainable business proved to be very difficult (sound familiar?)</p>



<p>Instead Etak quickly pivoted. It licensed the navigation code to the biggest automotive OEM hardware manufacturers at the time: Robert Bosch in Germany, GM in the USA and Clarion in Japan. In turn these companies developed their own navigation systems and, many years later, the concept of a ‘Personal Navigation Device’ from the likes of Blaupunkt, Garmin, Magellan, TomTom and many others was born.</p>



<p>During the course of doing business Etak attracted the attention of a perhaps an unusual suitor: Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation. It was News Corps’ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/apr/07/pressandpublishing.guardianobituaries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John B. Evans</a> that saw the potential. </p>



<p>Like Nolan Bushnell, John was a supreme visionary. You would often find him on the same platforms as Intel’s Andy Grove, Bill Gates and other technology megastars. Albert Scardino and Matt Falloon recount the story in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/apr/07/pressandpublishing.guardianobituaries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John’s obituary in the Guardian</a>:</p>







<blockquote>
<p>The defining deal of [John’s] career came in the mid-1980s. In 1985, Murdoch invested $350m in a group of travel publications and directories. With one hand, Evans took over the consumer magazine division of Murdoch’s US organisation, including TV Guide, Elle and one he himself invented, Automobile. With his other hand, he launched a secret project in a suburban office building to develop a part of the travel group, the Hotel and Travel Index, into a new media product, codenamed Jaguar.</p>



<p>In the days before streaming video and large file capacity on the internet, travellers’ views of their hotels and destinations were limited to tourist brochures. Jaguar allowed an electronic visual tour of destinations, complete with views of the hotel room they had booked. Once integrated with major airline booking information and other databases and cross-referencing tools, the system threatened to leapfrog other airline, car and hotel reservation systems.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was thus that John had the vision to use Etak’s maps and technology to benefit the Jaguar system. Thus John convinced Rupert to buy Etak. </p>



<p>Stan Honey recounts the conversations:</p>







<blockquote>
<p>John instantly saw the power of maps in media to change the world of classified ads, yellow pages, travel, and broadly answer the questions of “where is the nearest?” and “how do I get to it?”.&nbsp; Naturally, John and my shared sailing background created an instant group of common friends and experience.&nbsp; I remained close friends with John until he passed away and visited him often.&nbsp; Long after John had left News Corp, whenever I was tee’d up in New York waiting for a weather window for a Transatlantic record attempt under sail, I’d always invite John to come visit the boat, which he found fascinating as the boats were 100 foot monohulls or multihulls.&nbsp; I doubt that Etak would have ever appeared on Murdoch’s radar screen without John Evans’ vision and commitment to his vision, and to Etak.&nbsp; At the time of his decision to buy Etak, Murdoch also asked Barry Diller, who was then running Fox, for his opinion.&nbsp; Barry Diller was hard-nosed and direct in his questions, and had a slightly shorter term vision than did John, but Barry also supported News Corp’s acquisition of Etak, and focus on the maps.</p>



<p>John really was a long-term visionary, as was Nolan Bushnell.&nbsp; During the Etak days, both would visit and “wind-up” the Etak crew with their predictions.&nbsp; That was very helpful as the two of them kept our minds wide open.&nbsp; But it was also helpful that they would mostly stay away because we were burdened with the need to actually get things to work, which visionaries seldom are.&nbsp; It is interesting to note that all of the things that Nolan and John predicted, have happened.&nbsp; It is also interesting to remember how far-fetched they seemed at the time of their visits.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But the times there are a changin’: as fate would have it in 1989 Murdoch sold the Jaguar system to Reed International for a profit of $500M. With Jaguar sold the relevance of Etak to New Corp lessened. </p>



<p>News Corp subsequently sold Etak to SONY, who then later sold it to Tele Atlas. And still later Tele Atlas was subsumed by TomTom. So what was originally Etak is now <a href="http://tomtom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TomTom</a>:</p>

<h2>But Why the name ‘Etak’?</h2>



<p>The answer goes back to the early days of Polynesian navigation. In those days the ancient mariners navigated the seas by relying on a series of environmental cues, such as the positions of islands around them.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2657" data-permalink="https://maphappenings.com/2024/04/11/story-of-etak/etak-navigator-jpg-053/" data-orig-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg" data-orig-size="3840,2160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="etak-navigator-jpg.053" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=1024" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=1024" alt="Polynesian navigators" srcset="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=1024 1024w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=2048 2048w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>They imagined that that their boats were stationary and that the islands moved past them. </p>



<p>In the same way, in the Etak Navigator the vehicle is stationary and it’s the maps that move past the vehicle…</p>



<p>With that in mind, Stan decided to call his company Etak, which is a Polynesian term for moving navigational reference points.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2>But Wait, There is One More Thing…</h2>



<p>When you look at any consumer mapping app in navigation mode, have you noticed something?</p>



<p>Have you noticed something about the symbol used to denote vehicle location?</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2610" data-permalink="https://maphappenings.com/2024/04/11/story-of-etak/etak-navigator-jpg-058/" data-orig-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg" data-orig-size="3840,2160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="etak-navigator-jpg.058" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=1024" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=1024" alt="Map navigation symbol in Apple Maps" srcset="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=1024 1024w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=2048 2048w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Does it look familiar?  Well, of course it does … </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>So it turns out the symbol used by all navigation apps today is the same one originally invented by Etak.</p>



<p>But why did Etak use that particular symbol?</p>



<p>If you talk to the engineer who wrote the original code, George Loughmiller, he’ll be meek and tell you that it seemed like a good idea at the time. But you have to remember one thing: Etak was incubated by Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari. And at that time both Etak and Atari were housed in the same office building at 1287 Lawrence Station Road in Sunnyvale, California.</p>



<p>Because Etak used a vector display with limited CPU, George needed a symbol that didn’t burden the very scarce computing resources. He also needed a symbol that was easy to read. A traditional symbol for a car — 🚗 — required too many lines. It also didn’t clearly connote direction. Something simpler was needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Legend has it that one of Etak’s engineers got to see a pre-release demo of one of Atari’s latest games. And that game was…</p>

<h2>So There You Have It…</h2>



<p>Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything.</p>



<p>Etak’s many significant inventions included:</p>



<ul>
<li>the world’s first in-vehicle nav system that actually worked</li>



<li>augmented dead reckoning using map matching</li>



<li>moving map heads up display</li>



<li>first use of geocoding in a consumer application</li>



<li>algorithms for highly efficient map data storage and retrieval &nbsp;</li>



<li>heads up digitizing</li>



<li>the world’s first high volume digital map production system</li>



<li>inventor of the universal map navigation symbol</li>
</ul>



<p>I was but <a href="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/yours-truly.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a pimply engineer</a> at the time. Little did I know when I joined Etak in 1985 that I was going to be part of such an illustrious team.</p>



<p>My hats off and best wishes to everyone I worked with: it was a privilege, an honor and  an amazing journey. Thank you.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Scientific Research, vital for improving human life, is hindered by its inherent complexity, slow pace, and the need for specialized experts. To enhance its productivity, we propose a ResearchAgent, a large language model-powered research idea writing agent, which automatically generates problems, methods, and experiment designs while iteratively refining them based on scientific literature. Specifically, starting with a core paper as the primary focus to generate ideas, our ResearchAgent is augmented not only with relevant publications through connecting information over an academic graph but also entities retrieved from an entity-centric knowledge store based on their underlying concepts, mined and shared across numerous papers. In addition, mirroring the human approach to iteratively improving ideas with peer discussions, we leverage multiple ReviewingAgents that provide reviews and feedback iteratively. Further, they are instantiated with human preference-aligned large language models whose criteria for evaluation are derived from actual human judgments. We experimentally validate our ResearchAgent on scientific publications across multiple disciplines, showcasing its effectiveness in generating novel, clear, and valid research ideas based on human and model-based evaluation results.

                  <p><span>Since the number of pixels on the x-axis of the canvas is typically much smaller than the number of samples, you have to reduce the number of samples. This is very prone to aliasing if not done right, especially if you end up just drawing a line between the points. I found a good way to avoid aliasing by taking the min/max values for each chunk of samples and then filling the area in between rather than drawing lines between points. If you zoom in to a point where the window is only a few values, this will converge to the same result as just drawing lines between the samples. You can test it out by uploading audio files to our audio-to-midi web demo: <a href="https://samplab.com/audio-to-midi" rel="nofollow">https://samplab.com/audio-to-midi</a></span></p></div></td></tr>

Inevitably, this results in aliasing.<p>In the extreme we have the "Spotify" visualisations of vertical bars with gaps in between. I believe this is popular because it looks slightly better than a solid waveform lump with an aliased edge.</p><p>To avoid aliasing you need to use more than two pixel colours.

I picked a fixed number of horizontal pixels per second for an internally cached image. I think it was 30 pixels/second so that scrolling at 1x playback rate would be smooth on 60/90/120Hz screens. So it can't zoom into the waveform like yours, but I don't need it to zoom.<p>There are two parts: first the C++/wasm that analyses the audio and generates a bitmap that has width 30*duration and not very high. It effectively draws a line from each audio sample to the next, with alpha, but this can be optimised like crazy to a point where the time it takes is unnoticeable.</p><p>The second part is the WebGL that the bitmap (aka texture) and renders to the canvas. In principle this could be rotated, spun in 3d, mapped to a sphere or any other crazy GPU manipulations. WebGL isn't too painful and works everywhere I tried including the Android webview in my Bungee Timewarp app.

<p>We’ve reported previously on <a href="https://tmo.report/2022/12/t-mobiles-new-sim-protection-is-now-live-heres-how-to-enable-it/">the issue of “SIM Swapping”</a>, where a bad actor illegally and fraudulently obtains access to someone’s phone line by swapping the SIM card on the line to one they possess. This allows the criminal to use the line to obtain two-factor authentication codes sent to the victim for the purposes of accessing online accounts. Often, this results in the victim losing money, either from their bank accounts or crypto wallets.</p>



<p>Separately, T-Mobile has had issues with data breaches in the past, including one back in September <a href="https://tmo.report/2023/09/a-massive-new-data-breach-may-have-hit-t-mobile-90gb-of-user-data-exposed/">affecting employees of a third-party retailer named Connectivity Source</a>. Now a bad actor appears to be using employee data to contact them offering to pay for SIM swaps.</p>





<p>According to multiple posts on Reddit, as well as separate individuals sending us tips here at <em>The Mobile Report</em>, T-Mobile employees from all over the country are receiving texts offering them cash in exchange for swapping SIMs.</p>



<p>The texts offer the employee $300 per SIM swap, and asks the worker to contact them on telegram. The texts all come from a variety of different numbers across multiple area codes, making it more difficult to block.</p>

<p>The text also claims they acquired the employee’s number “from the T-Mo employee directory”. If true, it could mean T-Mobile’s employee directory, with contact numbers, has somehow been accessed.</p>



<p>It’s also possible the bad actor has live/current access to this data, though we consider that less likely due to the fact that some impacted people are former employees who have not worked at the company in months.</p>



<h2>Where did this private information come from?</h2>



<p>Still, the biggest issue here is how this person (or multiple people) obtained the employee phone numbers. We’re not sure yet which employees are impacted, but based on comments online it seems at least a few third-party employees are affected, and we’ve independently confirmed current corporate employees have also received the message.</p>





<p>Though we can’t say for certain, this likely means the information is not the same data as what was leaked during the Connectivity Source breach. We can’t, however, eliminate that possibility. As mentioned, there are reports that some of the contacted people are former employees, and haven’t been employed at T-Mobile for months, so the information being acted upon is likely a few months old at the very least.</p>



<p>That being said, we’re pretty confident based on corporate employees being included that this is a different source of data being used.</p>



<p>We reached out to T-Mobile PR and received the following response:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We did not have a systems breach. We continue to investigate these messages that are being sent to solicit illegal activity. We understand other wireless providers have reported similar messages.</p>
<cite>T-Mobile</cite></blockquote>



<h2>What it means for customers</h2>



<p>This news isn’t exactly comforting to customers, either. The fact that criminals still see SIM swapping as a viable way to make lots of money means companies haven’t done enough to help prevent them from happening.</p>



<p>Plus, with so many employees being offered a way to make some quick cash, it’s conceivable that a few of them might take up the offer, which means customer accounts (and money) could be at risk.</p>





<h2>What you should do as a customer</h2>



<p>Fortunately though, as a customer, you have ways to protect yourself. If you’re concerned about a possible SIM swap, you should take a few precautions.</p>



<p>First and foremost, if you use any services online that have two-factor authentication, be sure it is not SMS-based. Use an app like Google Authenticator or Authy for this purpose instead.</p>



<p>Sometimes, services may have SMS as the only option for two-factor. If this service is a bank or a crypto wallet, consider switching, because that isn’t great. That being said, you should also enable SIM protection on your T-Mobile account. To do this, <a href="https://tmo.report/2022/12/t-mobiles-new-sim-protection-is-now-live-heres-how-to-enable-it/">you can follow the instructions in our guide here.</a></p>





<p>Hopefully, this isn’t a new breach from the carrier known for data breaches lately. The best case scenario is the affected employee numbers are from the leak back in September, but it’s just as possible this is a new breach or method of access that affects many more.</p>

<p><b>Ramanujan's lost notebook</b> is the manuscript in which the Indian mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan" title="Srinivasa Ramanujan">Srinivasa Ramanujan</a> recorded the mathematical discoveries of the last year (1919–1920) of his life. Its whereabouts were unknown to all but a few mathematicians until it was rediscovered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Andrews_(mathematician)" title="George Andrews (mathematician)">George Andrews</a> in 1976, in a box of effects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._N._Watson" title="G.

The "notebook" is not a book, but consists of loose and unordered sheets of paper described as "more than one hundred pages written on 138 sides in Ramanujan's distinctive handwriting. The sheets contained over six hundred mathematical formulas listed consecutively without proofs."<sup id="cite_ref-RLNref_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-RLNref-1">[1]</a></sup>

<p>After Ramanujan died on April 26, 1920, at the age of 32, his wife gave his notebooks to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Madras" title="University of Madras">University of Madras</a>. On August 30, 1923, the registrar Francis Drewsbury sent much of this material to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy" title="G. H. Hardy">G. H. Hardy</a>, Ramanujan's mentor at Trinity College, where he probably received the manuscripts of the lost notebook.
</p>
<blockquote><p>... Almost surely, this manuscript, or at least most of it, was written during the last year of Ramanujan's life, after his return to India from England. ... The manuscript contains no introduction or covering letter. In fact, there are hardly any words in the manuscript. There are a few marks evidently made by a cataloguer, and there are a few remarks in the handwriting of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy" title="G. H. Hardy">G. H. Hardy</a>. Undoubtedly, the most famous objects examined in the lost notebook are the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_theta_function" title="Mock theta function">mock theta functions</a></i> ...<sup id="cite_ref-RLNref_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-RLNref-1">[1]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Some time between 1934 and 1947, Hardy probably passed the notebook on to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._N._Watson" title="G. N. Watson">G. N. Watson</a>, who with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertram_Martin_Wilson" title="Bertram Martin Wilson">B. M. Wilson</a> started on the project of editing Ramanujan's notebooks. However, Wilson died in 1935 and Watson seems to have lost interest in the project in the late 1930s.<sup id="cite_ref-BerndtRef_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-BerndtRef-3">[3]</a></sup> After Watson's death in 1965, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._Whittaker" title="J. M. Whittaker">J. M. Whittaker</a> examined Watson's  papers (which were a complete mess, due to be incinerated in a few days) and found Ramanujan's notebook, which he and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._A._Rankin" title="R. A. Rankin">R. A. Rankin</a> sent to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wren_Library,_Cambridge" title="Wren Library, Cambridge">Trinity College Wren library</a> on December 26, 1968.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Andrews_(mathematician)" title="George Andrews (mathematician)">George Andrews</a>&nbsp;(<a href="#CITEREFAndrews1986">1986</a>, section 1.5), following a suggestion by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Joan_Slater" title="Lucy Joan Slater">Lucy Slater</a>, found the lost notebook in the spring of 1976 while on a visit to Trinity College. It was published on December 22, 1987, by Narosa publishing house.

<p>George Andrews, an American mathematician, wrote in 2012 an account of the discovery for the 125th celebration of Ramanujan's birth.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> In his account, Andrews states that he was already an advanced researcher in fields, such as mock theta functions and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_series" title="Hypergeometric series">hypergeometric series</a>, related closely to works of Ramanujan. In 1970, anticipating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbatical" title="Sabbatical">sabbatical</a>, he wrote to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_people" title="British people">British</a> mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Joan_Slater" title="Lucy Joan Slater">Lucy Slater</a>. Slater "intriguingly" stated in her reply that she had inherited a "great collection" of papers from mathematicians such as Watson, Bailey, Jackson and Rogers, which were unsorted, including one of the last by Ramanujan. She also mentioned other papers were held by the Trinity College library.
</p><p>Although unable to travel to Europe in 1970, Andrews became able to do so in 1976, when he was due to attend a European conference in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg" title="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>, near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France%E2%80%93Germany_border" title="France–Germany border">Franco-German</a> border. He obtained permission and support from Slater, from the Trinity College library, and from his professor, Ben Noble, to visit Cambridge after the conference, in order to investigate the "invaluable" unpublished writings of Watson <i>et al</i>. Noble agreed, adding that if he could attempt to find a lost paper by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell" title="James Clerk Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a> at the same time, it would be appreciated. The library's documents included a list of matters held from Watson's estate. The list included the item: <i>"A 139 page manuscript by S. Ramanujan on q-series"</i>, containing the work from Ramanujan's final year.
</p><p>Although not labelled as such, the identity of the papers was settled because Ramanujan's final letters to Hardy had referred to the discovery of what Ramanujan called mock theta functions, although without great detail, and the manuscript included what appeared to be his full notes on these.

<p>
A Florida appeals court has effectively opened a loophole in the state's long-standing law against recording telephone conversations without the permission of both sides of the call, ruling that law enforcement officers performing their official duties can be secretly recorded because they have no expectation of privacy. </p><p>

The court's decision – involving a citizen who accused the Citrus County Sheriff's Office of misconduct – is the latest to provide new mechanisms for civilian oversight of law enforcement, even as others were curtailed in recent days by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Republican-led Legislature. </p><p>

In its <a href="https://5dca.flcourts.gov/content/download/2382881/opinion/Opinion_23-1354.pdf" target="_blank">ruling</a> last week, the Fifth District Court of Appeal in Daytona Beach threw out five felony wiretapping convictions against Michael Leroy Waite, 63, of Floral City. Waite has been engaged in a lengthy dispute over access to his property with the Citrus County Sheriff's Office as far back as 2018. The situation escalated after wildlife officers – accompanied by deputies holding rifles – sprayed herbicides in a canal off the Withlacoochee River along Waite’s property in west-central Florida. </p><p>

“The sheriff jumped on the airboat, trespassed onto my private property and pointed assault rifles at me as they ripped up and stole my ‘No Trespassing’ signs,” Waite said in an interview. He called the court’s decision groundbreaking: “I think a lot of people are going to be citing my case in the future,” he said. </p><p>

Sheriff’s deputies said Waite aimed a rifle at the officials spraying the herbicides. </p><p>

“The people out there doing the spraying for the herbicides for the county, they were in fear that this guy was going to do something, try to shoot them, try to kill them,” deputy Ryan Glaze testified in the case. Glaze said Waite had “sovereign citizen ideologies,” referring to the anti-government movement whose followers believe that courts have no jurisdiction over them.
</p><div role="presentation"> <h5>Related</h5>  </div>
<p>
Waite disputed that he was a sovereign citizen. “Totally false,” he said. “The only time I ever used the word ‘sovereign’ was to claim my private property is not state sovereignty land.” </p><p>

In January 2021, Waite called 911 to report what he believed was a trespassing incident by the sheriff and said he wanted to have the call recorded for a complaint against the sheriff. That same day, Sergeant Edward Blair called Waite back – and Waite recorded the three-minute phone conversation but did not inform Blair he was doing so, the court said. </p><p>

Waite emailed his recording of the call to the sheriff's office records department and requested an internal investigation. A month later, Waite was accused of five counts of illegal wiretapping for recording the conversation with the sergeant and four other calls with sheriff’s employees. </p><p>

The appeals court on Friday overturned the trial judge’s decision and ordered the judge to dismiss the wiretapping charges. </p><p>

“Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that any of the deputies exhibited a reasonable expectation of privacy that society is willing to recognize,” the court said. </p><p>

The sheriff’s office on Monday declined to make Citrus County Sheriff Mike Prendergast available to discuss the matter. </p><p>

It wasn't clear whether the court’s decision affects secretly recording the telephone conversations of other government employees in Florida conducting official business. It said Waite’s recording was allowed because there was “no dispute that all conversations concerned matters of public business, occurred while the deputies were on duty, and involved phones utilized for work purposes.” </p><p>

“This really broadens up the public’s ability to hold police officers accountable for their actions,” Waite said. “They have no expectation of privacy when they’re conducting official business and it doesn’t matter where they’re at.” </p><p>

The same day as the court’s ruling, DeSantis signed into law two bills affecting law enforcement in Florida. Two judges on the panel that issued the ruling Friday were DeSantis appointees. </p><p>

<a href="https://myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=78745" target="_blank">One</a> new law makes it illegal after a person has been warned to approach first responders or remain within 25 feet while they are performing a legal duty if the intent is to interfere, threaten or harass them. The new law doesn’t prevent people from recording law enforcement but can require them to move 25 feet back, which can make it more difficult. </p><p>

The <a href="https://myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=79178&amp;SessionId=103" target="_blank">other</a> requires that citizen review boards in Florida – intended to provide independent oversight of law enforcement actions – be re-established so that members are appointed by a sheriff or police chief and that at least one member be a retired law enforcement officer. </p><p>

Waite was separately convicted of battery on a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest with violence after he was accused of striking a deputy with his elbow when they arrived to arrest him on the wiretapping charges. Waite urged the appeals court to throw out those charges, too, but the judges declined. </p><p>

“As soon as I grabbed his arms to put him under arrest, to put them behind his back, that’s when I catch an elbow to my face, to my lower right jaw,” said Glaze, the deputy who arrested Waite. He said Waite surrendered after a detective shocked him with an electrical device. </p><p>

The judge sentenced Waite on all the charges to two years’ probation. He had faced up to 25 years in prison and fines of $25,000. </p><p>

“Waite did not demonstrate a lack of good faith and should have complied without resorting to violence,” the judges said. </p><p>

The court ruling Friday also was silent on the issue of whether the sheriff committed any misconduct: “We in no way suggest the CCSO committed police misconduct,” the ruling said. “Rather, this was how Waite perceived the situation.” </p><p>

Waite said his case will help the public hold law enforcement accountable and prevent officer misconduct. </p><p>

“Bringing these subjects to lay helps us maintain a civil society and civil government to be accountable for their actions,” Waite said. “The public, we just try to enjoy our property without people coming on trespassing and destroying it.”<br>

<b>summary</b>: NIST P521 private keys are exposed by biased signature generation<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>vulnerability:</i> This is a security vulnerability.<br>

<p>
Every version of the PuTTY tools from 0.68 to 0.80 inclusive has a
critical vulnerability in the code that generates signatures from
ECDSA private keys which use the NIST P521 curve. (PuTTY, or Pageant,
generates a signature from a key when using it to authenticate you
to an SSH server.)

</p><p>
This vulnerability has been assigned <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-31497">CVE-2024-31497</a>.
It was discovered by Fabian Bäumer and Marcus Brinkmann of the
Ruhr University Bochum; see their write-up
<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/15/6">on the oss-security mailing list</a>.

</p><p>
The bad news: the effect of the vulnerability is to <strong>compromise
the private key</strong>. An attacker in possession of a few dozen
signed messages and the public key has enough information to recover
the private key, and then forge signatures as if they were from you,
allowing them to (for instance) log in to any servers you use that key
for. To obtain these signatures, an attacker need only briefly
compromise any server you use the key to authenticate to, or
momentarily gain access to a copy of Pageant holding the key.
(However, these signatures are not exposed to passive eavesdroppers
of SSH connections.)

</p><p>
Therefore, if you have a key of this type, we recommend you revoke it
immediately: remove the old public key from all OpenSSH
<code>authorized_keys</code> files, and the equivalent in other SSH
servers, so that a signature from the compromised key has no value any
more. Then generate a new key pair to replace it.

</p><p>
(The problem is not with how the key was originally generated; it
doesn't matter whether it came from PuTTYgen or somewhere else. What
matters is whether it was ever <em>used</em> with PuTTY or Pageant.)

</p><p>
The good news: the <em>only</em> affected key type is 521-bit ECDSA.
That is, a key that appears in Windows PuTTYgen with
<code>ecdsa-sha2-nistp521</code> at the start of the 'Key fingerprint'
box, or is described as 'NIST p521' when loaded into Windows Pageant,
or has an id starting <code>ecdsa-sha2-nistp521</code> in the SSH
protocol or the key file. Other sizes of ECDSA, and other key
algorithms, are unaffected. In particular, Ed25519 is not affected.

</p><hr>

<p>
Details of the error:

</p><p>
All DSA signature schemes require a random value to be invented during
signing, known as the 'nonce' (cryptography jargon for a value used
only once), or sometimes by the letter <i>k</i>. It's well known that
if an attacker can guess the value of <i>k</i> you used, or find any two
signatures you generated with the same <i>k</i>, then they can
immediately recover your private key.

</p><p>
This means that it's dangerous to generate DSA signatures on systems
with no high-quality source of randomness. Significantly <em>more</em>
dangerous than generating the encryption keys for a single session: a
leak of the private key compromises far more than one SSH session.

</p><p>
For this reason, since PuTTY was developed on Windows before it had
any cryptographic random number generator at all, PuTTY has always
generated its <i>k</i> using a deterministic method, avoiding the need
for random numbers at all. The clever trick is to compute a secure
hash whose input includes the message to be signed <em>and also the
private key</em>. Secure hash output is indistinguishable from random
data (or else the hash function isn't doing its job), and this
generation method can't be repeated by an attacker who's trying to
<em>find out</em> the private key – if they could generate the same
hash input as you, they'd already have the private key.

</p><p>
This technique is now mainstream, and <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6979">RFC 6979</a> documents a
specific well-known way of doing it. But PuTTY didn't follow that
specification, because we started doing the same thing in 2001, and
the RFC wasn't published until 2013.

</p><p>
PuTTY's technique worked by making a SHA-512 hash, and then reducing
it mod <i>q</i>, where <i>q</i> is the order of the group used in the
DSA system. For integer DSA (for which PuTTY's technique was
originally developed), <i>q</i> is about 160 bits; for elliptic-curve
DSA (which came later) it has about the same number of bits as the
curve modulus, so 256 or 384 or 521 bits for the NIST curves.

</p><p>
In all of those cases except P521, the bias introduced by reducing a
512-bit number mod <i>q</i> is negligible. But in the case of P521,
where <i>q</i> has 521 bits (i.e. <em>more</em> than 512), reducing a
512-bit number mod <i>q</i> has no effect at all – you get a value of
<i>k</i> whose top 9 bits are always zero.

</p><p>
This bias is sufficient to allow a key recovery attack. It's less
immediate than if an attacker knows all of <i>k</i>, but it turns out
that if <i>k</i> has a biased distribution in this way, it's possible
to aggregate information from multiple signatures and recover the
private key eventually. Apparently the number of signatures required
is around 60.

</p><hr>

<p>
To fix this vulnerability, we've completely abandoned PuTTY's old
system for generating <i>k</i>, and switched to the RFC 6979
technique, for all DSA and ECDSA key types. (EdDSA keys such as
Ed25519 already used a different system, which has not changed.)
However, this doesn't affect the fact that information about
existing P521 private keys has <em>already</em> been leaked whenever
a signature was generated using the old <i>k</i> generator.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We spend a lot of time suing embezzlers. All over the world. Week in and week out. Big embezzlers, small embezzlers, smart embezzlers and very smart embezzlers…</p>

<p>That’s right, no dumb embezzlers because almost all the embezzlers we encounter are smart. Some are very smart. Some are brilliant.</p>

<p>And, almost always, most would have made more money and had a more profitable career if they had simply stopped stealing and starting working honestly.</p>

<p>I mean, figure it out. An embezzler has to not only do his or her job well so that no one is looking over his or her shoulder but has to do their job so well that they can steal for months or years and it won’t show up. They have to be charismatic and knowledgeable enough so that no one bothers to double check their work. They have to be very steady in their work so that it cannot be reviewed because they are on vacation or ill…in short, they have to be great employees. And either so boring that all ignore their existence or so well liked that no one would question their character. Most choose the latter mode since it also allows access to more accounts and financial secrets.</p>

<p>And when embezzlers run entire companies, they have to create a bottom line successful enough for long enough that investors and business colleagues respect and trust them after review of the books…at least for a time.</p>

<p>Took me a long time to figure that out…for the first few years of practice, I found it incredible that such brilliant and attractive people would be dumb enough to risk it all for the relatively paltry gains that embezzlement can earn. I kept looking to see the underlying motivations since, I figured, I could better advise clients what to look out for if I could figure out precisely what makes an embezzler embezzle.</p>

<p>Now I know.</p>

<p>They embezzle because they like it. They like the rush. They need money now, not in five years. They like being smarter than the drudges they figure are around them. And they embezzle, I am convinced, because they want to get caught sooner or later and that pattern is usually repeated over and over.</p>

<p>Take one of my favorite embezzlers, a guy who once owned the famous Flamingo Hotel in California until his world crumbled around him during a case our client brought against him in the late 1970’s. I had represented a minority shareholder in the venture and after perhaps a year of very aggressive litigation, Eddie Chan (not his real name) called it quits, transferred the shell of a company that was left to my client along with most of the rest of his assets, settled for a suspended sentence with the district attorney (to my fury) and then called me to invite me to lunch.</p>

<p>I had only been practicing for five years at the time and was unused to the foibles of opposing parties. I was nonplussed and immediately called his counsel to ask if that would be OK…as required by the Code of Ethics.</p>

<p>“Sure,” the relatively famous criminal defense attorney chirped, “and tell him to pay my bill while you’re at it.”</p>

<p>So there I was two days later with Eddie at his favorite Italian restaurant, Orsi, watching him fiddle with his fettuccini, his hands nervously twitching every so often, but immaculately dressed in a conservative business suit, expensive cufflinks and watch, the picture of a successful and conservative business man.</p>

<p>He had greeted me in a rather distracted manner, looking about the room, but friendly enough. Since I had been instrumental in destroying his economic well-being, and since he knew I had been demanding his incarceration for his embezzlement with the district attorney, I wondered why we were having this lunch. Cautious, I figured I’d let him tell me. And, in turn, I’d try to figure out what made him tick.</p>

<p>The waiters all knew him. He was a regular and his waistline showed it. Friendly but not effusive, soft-spoken and understated, he appeared now as he had been throughout the trial…a typical intelligent businessman slightly shocked that people were upset with him, but just maybe a hint of irony somehow mixed into his replies. On the stand he had been asked what he had done with the money.</p>

<p>“Spent it. I have none left. If I did, perhaps I would pay it back.”</p>

<p>“On what did you spend it? Are those assets in the United States at this time?"</p>

<p>He had stared at me for a moment, knowing I was looking for assets to attach, then suddenly smiled sadly. “I spent it on sweet, stupid things that make life an appropriate journey. Little things with some elegance attached. Things only worth buying because they have little value in the long run. Like life, itself.”</p>

<p>There was some laughter in the court room but my client had begun to mutter darkly at my side, furious that these “little things” had bankrupted the hotel. As I sat there in that elegant restaurant, I decided that he had, for once, been telling the truth.</p>

<p>“Is this lunch a little elegant thing to make life bearable, Eddie?” I now asked.</p>

<p>I thought he would smile but he looked at me steadily for the first time that afternoon. After a moment’s silence, he said softly, “Your courts are not used to hearing an honest statement, are they?”</p>

<p>“What's that? You’re telling me that you spent it all, nothing is left?”</p>

<p>“You are still cross-examining me. You are still looking for assets. I am speaking of honest answers. Of course I spent it. Why else take it? Money taken like that should not be spent on necessities of life but on luxuries of life. Necessities of life are the proper destination of grim jobs with little men working at little desks.”</p>

<p>He waved to the water to refill his wine glass. I was suddenly reminded of the movie Casablanca in the coffee house with Sidney Greenstreet making a deal. I was also angry. “Those little people were your victims, Eddie. They work years and you take what they make and bankrupt businesses left and right. For luxuries.”</p>

<p>“Of course I do. You are stating the obvious. What you are not stating is why it matters so much to arouse such passion. I am the one losing all. Not you and not your client. Do I appear upset?”</p>

<p>He didn’t. He appeared bemused, not upset. He leaned forward. “Look, that is the past and I want to move forward. I want this to be a constructive meeting.”</p>

<p>“Meeting? Constructive meeting?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have an opportunity. You represent many clients who might be interested. It should be very profitable.”</p>

<p>And for the next ten minutes he explained in some detail a new business venture he was considering involving Hong Kong property. Finally I could take it no longer.</p>

<p>“Look, Eddie,” I interrupted, “I can’t believe this. I’m the guy who wanted you in jail. Remember? I know you and your past. You seem to think I’d tell my clients to invest in you. Are you nuts?”</p>

<p>He was shocked. “Of course you would. You already know who I am and what I do. You don’t have to worry about checking out my background. You can build all the safeguards you need. This isn’t about me. It’s about the deal. If it’s a good deal, you should jump at it. Better the thief you know than the thief you don’t know. This is a perfect opportunity for you. Who else would think of investing with me?” And off he went again with his business plan.</p>

<p>I pushed my cannelloni around while he expounded on the future of Hong Kong and when he finally wound down, asked, “Does it not occur to you that people want to do business with honest people they can trust? Not dishonest people they have to watch?”</p>

<p>He became exasperated. “Didn’t you tell your client you have to create checks and balances in the company and watch each and every employee?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but…”</p>

<p>“And don’t you insist on systems being created in every company so that no one can get away with cooking the books or taking from the company no matter who is in charge?”</p>

<p>“Yes…”</p>

<p>“Then what difference does it make if someone you don’t trust is involved? You don’t trust anyone anyway. If your systems work, they work. I am not any more of a danger to you than any other person. I don’t see the problem.”</p>

<p>And he didn’t see a problem. Either with his plan or his actions--except that he was caught. Oh, perhaps a little guilt now and then…but nothing that good wine could not assuage. Business was business, and his was stealing if he could get away with it.</p>

<p>There was a certain splendor in his lack of hypocrisy, a certain attraction in his blunt appraisal of his own role.</p>

<p>But I would not recommend business with him to anyone.</p>

<p>Since what Eddie didn’t understand is that people are not only in business for the money. Oh, it’s important, but it’s never just the money in my experience. It’s a dozen other things, the joy of creating something from nothing, the excitement of success, the comradeship one gets from working in a team that is good and effective, etc, etc.</p>

<p>Business may be competitive, but there are rules and it is not war.</p>

<p>To Eddie, business was not only war, but war with the only rules being do not get caught if you can and make all the money you can. And trust no one.</p>

<p>I had another client about the same time, an elderly business man disliked by almost all that knew him, a truly unpleasant individual who never praised anyone, made more money than anyone I knew and could be cast as Scrooge except for his enjoyment of fishing which was all that he truly cared about other than money. But honest…he often would give more to the other side in the bargain than they asked because it was better business tactics to have a vendor who was making good money with you than not. During a break in a negotiation I told him about Eddie, laughing.</p>

<p>He didn’t think it was funny.</p>

<p>“Eddie’s just more honest than a lot of the business men I know. Get the money any way you can, any time you can, short-term thinking, everyone is a crook anyway, so what’s the big deal? I know a lot of people like that. They think they’re smart. They’re not. They grab a nickel here and lose a dollar in the long run. Like him…but he’s just crude and a little stupid.”</p>

<p>“Crude?”</p>

<p>“The smarter ones do it legally.” He grinned and the negotiation began again.</p>

<p>Eddie died about three years later. I read in the papers that his funeral was well-attended, even by some of his newly created victims. Perhaps they were gloating. Or perhaps they liked him.</p>

<p>Because, all in all, he was a pretty nice guy. Being a nice guy is how he made his living, after all. Who would entrust their&nbsp;money to a grouch?</p>
