I collected some of the suggested projects and put them in a list at the end of this post.</i></p>

<p><b>Check out the second sequel too: <a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/challengingalgorithms.html">Challenging algorithms and data structures every programmer should try</a>.</b></p>

<p>I talk to a lot of students and professional developers that often want to start a side project, but aren't sure what to build. Below is a handful of software projects that taught me a lot. In fact, they're great because you could build them multiple times and learn new things each time. So whenever I don't know what to build or I want to learn a new programming language or framework, I start with one of these:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Text editor</li>
    <li>2D game - Space Invaders</li>
    <li>Compiler - Tiny BASIC</li>
    <li>Mini operating system</li>
    <li>Spreadsheet <small>(<i>hard!</i>)</small></li>
    <li>Video game console emulator <small>(<i>hard!</i>)</small></li>
</ul>


<br><h3>Text Editor</h3>

<p>We use text editors everyday, but do you know how it really works? Ignoring all of the fancy features that your favorite editor has, how would you implement a textbox that supports a movable text cursor and selecting, inserting, and deleting text? No, you can't use the builtin textbox component from your favorite GUI framework!</p>

<p>The biggest challenge is figuring out how to store the text document in memory. My first thought was to use an array, but that has horrible performance if the user inserts text anywhere other than the end of the document. Luckily, there are some nice data structures to learn to solve this.</p>

<p>Another hurdle was learning how a text cursor behaves in popular editors. For example, if I press the up arrow key with the cursor in the middle of the document, where will the cursor move? Same column? Not if that line is shorter. Keep pressing up. The cursor will snap back to the original column once a line is long enough. It turns out that the cursor has a memory for the column and tries to get back to it. It is these details that I never noticed until I tried to implement it.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/textcursor.gif">

<p>After implementing the basic editor, I challenge you to implement two more features: undo/redo and word wrapping. Implementing undo/redo in an efficient way was mind blowing to me! I first tried keeping an array of previous states, then tried the Memento pattern, before finally settling on the Command pattern. Word wrapping forces you to separate the <i>visual</i> aspects of a text line from the memory aspects.</p>


<p>Things to learn:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Data structures for storing the text: array, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)">rope</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_buffer">gap buffer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_table">piece table</a>.</li>
    <li>Behavior and implementation of the text cursor.</li>
    <li>Design patterns for undo/redo: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern">memento</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern">command</a>.</li>
    <li>Abstractions to separate the visual and memory aspects of the text.</li>
</ul>

<br><h3>2D game - Space Invaders</h3>

<p>Even the most simple games require some unique data structures and design patterns. The idea here is to implement a well-defined game from start to finish without getting bogged down on the other fun stuff (e.g., game design and art). Also, it is best if you use a barebones 2D graphics library (e.g., SDL, SFML, PyGame), not a big game engine that'll hide all of the interesting bits from you.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/spaceinvaders.png">

<p>First, you'll have to learn to draw to the screen. I had no idea how this worked. You are actually clearing the screen then drawing each portion of the screen in rapid succession, many times a second, to create the effect that objects are moving.</p>

<p>Second, you'll learn all about the game loop. A game is effectively looping between drawing, getting user input, and processing the game logic.</p>

<p>Third, you'll learn how to process user input. I never paid attention to the subtlties of initially pressing, holding, and releasing keys or mouse buttons, let alone handling things like a double click. And how often do you check for user input? If you are constantly checking then that means the rest of the game is frozen!</p>

<p>Fourth, you'll learn how to create and manage all of your game objects and their state. For example, how do you generate a dynamic number of enemies? The factory pattern helps a lot.</p>

<p>Fifth, you'll learn how to apply the game's logic. When do bullet positions get updated? When do more enemies come onscreen? How do you know when an enemy is destroyed? When is the game over? I had never used the modulo operator prior to making games but it is littered all over my games' code.</p> 

<p>Once you get the basic game working, add a title screen menu, a game over screen, make sure the game runs at the same speed even on different computers, and explore how to implement more interesting enemies with AI. Still not enough? Add shader effects, sound, and online multiplayer!</p>


<p>Things to learn:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Drawing to the screen.</li>
    <li>Handling user input.</li>
    <li>Game loop.</li>
    <li>Creating and managing a dynamic number of objects (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_(object-oriented_programming)">factory pattern</a>).</li>
    <li>State machines for enemy AI.</li>
    <li>Playing sound.</li>
    <li>Using shaders.</li>
    <li>Networking for online features.</li>
</ul>

<br><h3>Compiler - Tiny BASIC</h3>

<p>The most-eye opening projects I have worked on are compilers. Even now, if I have a free Sunday afternoon to do some coding, chances are it is a compiler. It is a great feeling when you create something that enables others to create more things. By implementing one I had to learn so much more about the intricacies of compilers that I normally would never think about (e.g., when do expressions get implicitly type converted).</p>

<p>I suggest writing the compiler from scratch for a very small BASIC-like language (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC">Tiny BASIC</a>) and compile to any other language that you know well. For example, you could write a Tiny BASIC compiler in Python that outputs C# code. It does <b>not</b> have to output assembly or C! Avoiding those will let you focus on the compiler itself.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/peaybasic.png">

<p>The first hurdle is figuring out how to lex (or tokenize) the input code. Then you will parse the code, that is check the structure of the input and produce a tree representation of the code. The recursive descent parsing technique is beautiful! Next you will semantically check the input, ensuring the code makes sense and that the type rules are being followed. Finally, you can generate output!</p>

<p>This project has a ton of existing resources to help you, and a simple compiler can be completed in a few days. Don't let the jargon scare you. Plus the possibilities are endless to what you can add! Once you have the basic compiler working, you can add a standard library (in PeayBASIC I added simple 2D graphics functionality), optimization passes, and improve the error messages. Finally, you should write some example programs in your own language to show off to the world!</p>

<br><h3>Mini Operating System</h3>

<p>Over the years I have found myself applying fundamental concepts from operating systems to a variety of domains, like games and even predictive models of human behavior. In a classroom setting the algorithms and data structures used by operating systems might seem abstract or useless, but they really are useful. Implementing an operating system also helped me understand far more about what is going on under the hood.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/marzos.png">

<p>There is a bit of a learning curve and some barriers to get started since it is dependent on hardware. However, by following a book or tutorial then you should be able to get a bootable OS working that can run your own programs. I highly recommend my colleague's free online book, <a href="http://osblog.stephenmarz.com/index.html">Making a RISC-V Operating System using Rust</a>.</p>

<h3>Spreadsheet</h3>

<p>A spreadsheet application, like Excel, combines some of the challenges from a text editor with those of a compiler. You'll have to learn how to represent the cell contents in memory and implement an interpreter for the programming language used for equations.</p>

<br><h3>Video game console emulator</h3>

<p>Writing an emulator (or virtual machine) for a video game console combines the challenges of writing a compiler, an operating system, and a compiler all into one. It is quite rewarding to play a real game made by someone else with your emulator!</p> 

<p>Emulating a real video game console means writing a virtual machine that pretends to function just like the actual CPU and other hardware components. This allows you to run games designed for the video game console with your emulator.</p>

<p>I recommend starting by emulating CHIP-8, which is a simple, fictitious console, before moving on to a real video game console. The NES, SNES, Gameboy, and Gameboy Advance are all quite feasible to emulate, with a far amount of documentation and open source emulators already, though they each have their own quirks to make things interesting (e.g., certain games may rely on undocumented bugs/features of the specific hardware). There is also the PICO-8, which has become a very profitable "fantasy" console.</p>

			<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>First, we would like to apologize for the lack of blog posts this year. We planned to do more, but other priorities kept getting in the way. We continued to provide updates through our Discord and social medias during this time, but we plan to use this blog more often now.</p>
<p>This blog post will be a bit more serious than previous posts, as the subject matter is rather somber. We apologize for the lack of energy and quips you may have enjoyed in previous posts. This post will have information regarding several aspects of the shutdown, some of which have been covered on other social media posts. Please use the table of contents below to jump to your desired section.</p>

<h2 id="the-shutdown">The Shutdown</h2>
<p>In October of 2023, Nintendo <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/63227/~/announcement-of-discontinuation-of-online-services-for-nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u">announced the shutdown of Nintendo Network</a> for April of 2024. It was stated that a specific date and time would be announced later, and as of this post that has not happened yet. There have been no public announcements of any services shutting down early, though Nintendo stated they reserve they right to do so if:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"an event occurs that would make it difficult to continue online services for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it appears that Nintendo has begun a slow rollout of shutdowns. Intentional or not.</p>
<h2 id="super-mario-maker">Super Mario Maker</h2>
<p>This information was also detailed in a <a href="https://twitter.com/PretendoNetwork/status/1736325668412031255">Twitter thread</a>. You may read this there if you wish, or read the repost below.</p>
<p>Some time in early December 2023, Super Mario Maker began throwing error <code>106-0502</code> very often when trying to connect. It is unclear when this truly began, but the earliest occurrences we could find were around the 8th of December. Upon inspection, the cause for this error was clear: the server the game was attempting to connect to no longer existed. Our first assumption was that this was the beginning of the shutdown early, that Nintendo may have started turning off games without notice. After some more research, however, we discovered some users able to still connect.</p>
<p>Games on Nintendo Network function using 3 servers:</p>
<ol>
<li>The account server, which tells the client the location of the game's authentication server and provides the client with a token to connect with.</li>
<li>The game's authentication server, which logs the user in using the internal NEX account (details on this in the <a href="#new-accounts-prerequisite">New Accounts (Prerequisite)</a> section), and tells the client the location of the game's secure server.</li>
<li>The game's secure server, which is where all the game play content happens at.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every game on Nintendo Network uses the same 2 authentication servers. However each game has many dedicated secure servers. When logging in, the authentication server gives one of many randomly selected addresses to connect to. We believe this is some form of load balancing, splitting connections between many servers. The issue resulting in <code>106-0502</code> is that the authentication server is now giving clients addresses to dead servers. So far, we have only been able to identify a single working address for the game.</p>
<p>We believe this is due to Nintendo attempting to scale back how many servers are running for each game, to save on costs as the shutdown date approaches. They most likely made an error in their presumed load balancer to not remove these now dead servers from the pool of available addresses. We believe this was done completely unintentionally, however Nintendo shows no signs of fixing this error.</p>
<h2 id="new-accounts-prerequisite">New Accounts (Prerequisite)</h2>
<p>As briefly touched on in <a href="#super-mario-maker">Super Mario Maker</a>, Nintendo actually uses a series of internal accounts for several services. For games, these are called "NEX accounts". Some background knowledge is required for this section, which will be gone over now.</p>
<p>NEX is the software Nintendo uses for all 3DS and WiiU games (and some Switch games). It is based on a library called Rendez-Vous, made by Canadian software company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040610104624/http://www.quazal.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=101&amp;page=1">Quazal</a>. Quazal, before being bought out by Ubisoft, would license Rendez-Vous to anyone. Many games, on many platforms, by many developers, all use some variation of Rendez-Vous as it was highly extensible. This is why our server libraries are <a href="https://twitter.com/PretendoNetwork/status/1727016210435641508">theoretically compatible with Ubisoft games</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo licensed Rendez-Vous and modified it quite a bit, stripping out some more complex features and adding in some custom protocols, rebranding it to NEX. The important takeaway here is that Nintendo did not build this system from scratch, and instead modified a system made for generic game server usage.</p>
<h2 id="new-accounts">New Accounts</h2>
<p>Some time in late December 2023, new accounts could no longer go online in any games on both the WiiU and 3DS.</p>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="#new-accounts-prerequisite">New Accounts (Prerequisite)</a>, Nintendo did not make their game server software from scratch. Rendez-Vous comes with its own account system, likely due to it being designed for use in one-off games. At the time of its development, online multiplayer games were still very new and the concept of a unified account system (such as Nintendo Network or Uplay) spanning many different games made by the same company, was not a thing. Therefore, Nintendo needed to cope with this existing account system in some way.</p>
<p>On the 3DS, the console registers a new NEX account on the Friends server once during the console's setup process. Each 3DS, under normal circumstances, will only ever have a single account at a time (though this is not <em>always</em> true, but not relevant). This is why a NNID is not required to play most games online on the 3DS, as games use your NEX account to login to all game servers. Because of this, a new NEX account will never be created again unless the old one is removed using CFW or by factory resetting the console.</p>
<p>On the WiiU, a new NEX account is created automatically when the NNID is registered, and the NEX account is linked to this NNID. The console then alerts the Friends server of the new NEX account, much like 3DS. Despite using NNIDs, the WiiU also uses these NEX accounts to go online in all games.</p>
<p>Once a NEX account has been created, the Friends server synchronizes this account with all other game servers on Nintendo Network. This is due to the aforementioned account system provided by Rendez-Vous. Due to each game having their own server, and Rendez-Vous not having the concept of a unified account system, each game server has its own account system internally, which is synchronized with other games. It is actually possible to create accounts in other servers besides the Friends server if using a modified client, and those accounts will be usable in other games.</p>
<p>This synchronization process has been stopped. New NEX accounts are no longer being synchronized with any other servers on the network. This affects all games. Because of this, any attempt to connect to any game using an account made after this change was made will result in error <code>106-0303</code> on the WiiU and <code>006-0303</code> on the 3DS, internally called <code>RendezVous::InvalidUsername</code>.</p>
<p>It is not clear at this time whether this was intentional or not.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We ask that you do not spam Nintendo's support lines with these issues. Doing so may cause Nintendo to pull the plug entirely early. There are only 3 possible scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nintendo is aware of these issues already, and spam would annoy them to the point of pulling the plug.</li>
<li>Nintendo is not aware of these issues, and alerting them may cause them to pull the plug. They have already stated that anything making things "difficult" may come with an early shutdown.</li>
<li>These issues were intentional, and spam would annoy them to the point of pulling the plug.</li>
</ol>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to View</h2>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Open a web browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080/</code></li>
<li>Use the application by following the instructions on the website.</li>
</ol>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Customisation</h2>
<p dir="auto">Stirling PDF allows easy customization of the app.
Includes things like</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Custom application name</li>
<li>Custom slogans, icons, images, and even custom HTML (via file overrides)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">There are two options for this, either using the generated settings file <code>settings.yml</code>
This file is located in the <code>/configs</code> directory and follows standard YAML formatting</p>
<p dir="auto">Environment variables are also supported and would override the settings file
For example in the settings.yml you have</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="system:
  defaultLocale: 'en-US'"><pre><code>system:
  defaultLocale: 'en-US'
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To have this via an environment variable you would have <code>SYSTEM_DEFAULTLOCALE</code></p>
<p dir="auto">The Current list of settings is</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="security:
  enableLogin: false # set to 'true' to enable login
  csrfDisabled: true

system:
  defaultLocale: 'en-US' # Set the default language (e.g. 'de-DE', 'fr-FR', etc)
  googlevisibility: false # 'true' to allow Google visibility (via robots.txt), 'false' to disallow
  customStaticFilePath: '/customFiles/static/' # Directory path for custom static files

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Extra notes</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Endpoints. Currently, the endpoints ENDPOINTS_TO_REMOVE and GROUPS_TO_REMOVE can include comma separate lists of endpoints and groups to disable as example ENDPOINTS_TO_REMOVE=img-to-pdf,remove-pages would disable both image-to-pdf and remove pages, GROUPS_TO_REMOVE=LibreOffice Would disable all things that use LibreOffice. You can see a list of all endpoints and groups <a href="https://github.com/Frooodle/Stirling-PDF/blob/main/Endpoint-groups.md">here</a></li>
<li>customStaticFilePath. Customise static files such as the app logo by placing files in the /customFiles/static/ directory. An example of customising app logo is placing a /customFiles/static/favicon.svg to override current SVG. This can be used to change any images/icons/css/fonts/js etc in Stirling-PDF</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Environment only parameters</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>SYSTEM_ROOTURIPATH</code> ie set to <code>/pdf-app</code> to Set the application's root URI to <code>localhost:8080/pdf-app</code></li>
<li><code>SYSTEM_CONNECTIONTIMEOUTMINUTES</code> to set custom connection timeout values</li>
<li><code>DOCKER_ENABLE_SECURITY</code> to tell docker to download security jar (required as true for auth login)</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">API</h2>
<p dir="auto">For those wanting to use Stirling-PDFs backend API to link with their own custom scripting to edit PDFs you can view all existing API documentation
<a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Frooodle/Stirling-PDF/" rel="nofollow">here</a> or navigate to /swagger-ui/index.html of your stirling-pdf instance for your versions documentation (Or by following the API button in your settings of Stirling-PDF)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Login authentication</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Frooodle/Stirling-PDF/blob/main/images/login-light.png"><img src="https://github.com/Frooodle/Stirling-PDF/raw/main/images/login-light.png" alt="stirling-login"></a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Prerequisites:</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>User must have the folder ./configs volumed within docker so that it is retained during updates.</li>
<li>Docker uses must download the security jar version by setting <code>DOCKER_ENABLE_SECURITY</code> to <code>true</code> in environment variables.</li>
<li>Then either enable login via the settings.yml file or via setting <code>SECURITY_ENABLE_LOGIN</code> to <code>true</code></li>
<li>Now the initial user will be generated with username <code>admin</code> and password <code>stirling</code>. On login you will be forced to change the password to a new one. You can also use the environment variables <code>SECURITY_INITIALLOGIN_USERNAME</code> and  <code>SECURITY_INITIALLOGIN_PASSWORD</code> to set your own straight away (Recommended to remove them after user creation).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Once the above has been done, on restart, a new stirling-pdf-DB.mv.db will show if everything worked.</p>
<p dir="auto">When you login to Stirling PDF you will be redirected to /login page to login with those default credentials. After login everything should function as normal</p>
<p dir="auto">To access your account settings go to Account settings in the settings cog menu (top right in navbar) This Account settings menu is also where you find your API key.</p>
<p dir="auto">To add new users go to the bottom of Account settings and hit 'Admin Settings', here you can add new users. The different roles mentioned within this are for rate limiting. This is a Work in progress which will be expanding on more in future</p>
<p dir="auto">For API usage you must provide a header with 'X-API-Key' and the associated API key for that user.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Q1: What are your planned features?</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Progress bar/Tracking</li>
<li>Full custom logic pipelines to combine multiple operations together.</li>
<li>Folder support with auto scanning to perform operations on</li>
<li>Redact text (Via UI not just automated way)</li>
<li>Add Forms</li>
<li>Multi page layout (Stich PDF pages together) support x rows y columns and custom page sizing</li>
<li>Fill forms mannual and automatic</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Q2: Why is my application downloading .htm files?</h3>
<p dir="auto">This is a issue caused commonly by your NGINX congifuration. The default file upload size for NGINX is 1MB, you need to add the following in your Nginx sites-available file. <code>client_max_body_size SIZE;</code> Where "SIZE" is 50M for example for 50MB files.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Q3: Why is my download timing out</h3>
<p dir="auto">NGINX has timeout values by default so if you are running Stirling-PDF behind NGINX you may need to set a timeout value such as adding the config <code>proxy_read_timeout 3600;</code></p>

<p>There are lots of commercial alarm clocks with integrated clock projector on the market but I thought, it would be fun to build one myself.</p>
<p>Moreover it was a good project for becoming&nbsp;accustomed to the process of 3d-designing cases which can be 3d printed and to learn about designing tolerances.</p>
<p>The principle is easy – basically it works like a video beamer (or any other projecting clock^^).</p>

<h2>LCD and Calculations</h2>
<p>I choosed a small negative (background black) 64×32 LCD which has the dimensions of just 15mm x 12mm (active area 11.18mm x 5.58mm).</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="53" data-permalink="https://microengineer.eu/2018/05/01/diy-night-clock-projector/lcd/" data-orig-file="https://microengineer332294991.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lcd.png" data-orig-size="398,347" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="lcd" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://microengineer332294991.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lcd.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://microengineer332294991.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lcd.png?w=398" src="https://microengineer332294991.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lcd.png?w=1000" alt="lcd" srcset="https://microengineer332294991.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lcd.png 398w, https://microengineer332294991.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lcd.png?w=150&amp;h=131 150w, https://microengineer332294991.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lcd.png?w=300&amp;h=262 300w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px"></p>
<p>The goal was to build a complete projector with not more than 50mm x 50mm x 50mm (which I didn’t managed … But close to^^).</p>
<p>A small LCD has the advantage that everything becomes smaller and cheaper – this influences heavily costs for optics because a smaller LCD needs smaller optics to project an low distorted image.</p>
<p>Moreover a smaller LCD needs smaller focal length for a decent sized imaged on the ceiling. A good distance would be 2m from LCD to ceiling.</p>
<p>The formula for image width depending from the focal length is defined as:</p>

<p>with:<br>
– S2 distance from lens to LCD and<br>
– S1 distance from lens to ceiling<br>
– W2 is the width of the LCD<br>
– W1 is the width of the projected image</p>
<p>The formulas show that the smaller the focal length the larger the projected image will be.</p>
<p>I decided to go for 25mm because there are cheap lenses which can be obtained for about $12 in china.</p>
<p>For our values that would magnify the image by about x80 – 11.1mm LCD width would become 88.1cm image width on the ceiling in a distance of 2m.</p>
<h2>Light and Condensor Lens</h2>
<p>It was not really clear how strong a LED has to be in order to get a reasonable well readable picture in the night on the ceiling.</p>
<p>To be sure – actually I wasn’t really – I decided to use a high power LED with 1W and use a cheap chinese condensor lense to parallelize the light before it passes the LCD (this has do be done anyway but a condensor lens makes it possible to use more light because condensors are shaped in a way that allowes to get the lens as near to the LED as possible – so catching more light).</p>

<p>The two pictures show the condensor-lense which is directly mounted to the PCB the resulting light spot on the ceiling. It is a really gread lens which is made for my LED – so it fits perfectly and parallelizes the light nicely.</p>
<h2>Electronics Construction</h2>
<p>Two PCBs were designed – one holding the LCD and the actual projecting board.</p>

<p>The latter is equipped with 1W LED driver, STM32F103 Cortex ARM, a rotary encoder (for changing settings like brightness, standby-timer, time, …), USB, IR (both not used yet).</p>
<h2>Mechanics Construction</h2>
<p>Originally, I aimed for 50mm x 50mm x 50mm but I only managed to get to 60mm x 60mm x 60mm 😥 😉</p>
<p>Here an overview about all I designed:</p>

<p>From left to right: Case with DIY projection lens (I skip this part – it worked but not really well), Sony E-Mount, C-Mount. In the middle the rest.</p>
<h3>LCD-Holder</h3>
<p>A custom LCD-holder was designed to perfectly mount the LCD on the right place on the PCB.</p>

<h3>Case – C-Mount Variant</h3>
<p>There are incredibly cheap chinase C-Mount lenses with a focal length of 25mm. They are sooo cheap that image quality is really really bad when using for fotography.</p>

<p>The pillow-effect (optical distortion where the edges are not straight but bent outwards) is almost neglectable – resulting a much better image than I expected (after reading reviews to this lense)</p>

<h3>Case – Sony E-Mount Variant</h3>
<p>Just for fun – and because I have a 3d printer which works reliably without much attention – I did a variant for Sony E-Mount.</p>

                  <p><span>The biggest missing element, in my mind, of the pro-"classicist" and anti-"mockist" view is that the practice of writing unit tests with mocking leads to refactoring your code until it works with that approach, which in turn leads to better-designed code. I don't like the emphasis of "yeah but refactoring code leads to needing to rewrite mocked tests", because if you've designed your code well, then the need to adjust an api boundary should be less frequent than the need to adjust the internal implementation details. Focusing on integration tests means you can get away with poorly designed code full of corner cases that your integration tests can't catch. Besides, "we can keep the fast feedback loop with parallel tests" really increases the demands on complicated tooling that breaks often.</span></p></div></td></tr>

<p>AI has undoubtedly made waves in 2023 and here we spotlight the most significant stories of the year poised to shape the future of this groundbreaking industry:</p>



<p><em>Correction: In the original blog post published on December 22, 2023, the title “AI Releases” caused confusion as the content encompassed announcements and updates in addition to releases. We clarified the title of the text and infographic. The mention of Stability AI open-sourcing its LLM was excluded from the infographic but left in the article, underscoring its significance in promoting accessibility rather than focusing on tech improvement. The infographic initially featured the establishment of the xAI startup, now removed because of irrelevance. Additionally, the mention of Apple Vision Pro was excluded as the article focuses on software. We also included Midjourney V.6 in the list as it is a very recent release.</em> <em>These adjustments aim to improve accuracy and coherence. We apologize for any confusion and appreciate your understanding!</em></p>



<h4><strong>AI Advancements</strong></h4>



<p>In the landscape of AI advancements this year, notable progress was made, refining existing technologies rather than introducing groundbreaking innovations akin to the&nbsp;<a href="https://journal.everypixel.com/ai-highlights-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">ChatGPT or image generators of the previous year</a>. While there was no wow effect and the real Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is still far away, this year marked an intermediate stage between prior breakthroughs and something even more powerful to come. To showcase this evolution, we crafted a visual timeline, highlighting the most remarkable AI advancements that have shaped this year of AI:</p>

<h4><strong>Legal Landscape</strong></h4>



<p>In the ever-evolving legal realm of AI, 2023 finds itself amidst a landscape filled with uncertainties and ongoing debates. As new challenges emerge, discussions surrounding copyright, corporate policies, and the broader regulatory framework continue, shaping the contours of AI’s legal landscape. Here are the most important legal issues of the year 2023:</p>



<p><strong>European AI Act</strong></p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="">European Union introduced the AI Act</a>, the world’s first comprehensive law, to regulate the use of AI. The act classifies AI systems based on the risk they pose and sets forth regulations accordingly. Although the AI Act has been provisionally agreed upon, its implementation faces delays, and the enforcement won’t commence until 2025.</p>



<p><strong>U.S. Copyright Office Stance on Registration of AI-Generated Content</strong></p>



<p>The U.S. Copyright Office took a decisive stance,&nbsp;<a href="https://journal.everypixel.com/top-ai-news-february-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">denying copyright</a>&nbsp;registration for images created by the AI algorithm Midjourney. The rejection set a precedent, asserting that AI artworks solely created by AI, without human involvement, are ineligible for copyright protection. In the same vein, the&nbsp;<a href="https://journal.everypixel.com/top-ai-news-march-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">U.S. Copyright Office issued guidance</a>&nbsp;on AI-assisted works, clarifying that works created by humans using AI tools may be eligible for copyright protection. The guidance confirmed that works created by humans using AI tools should be evaluated based on whether the human role in the creation of those works was determinative.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“Currently, the existing legal system is not prepared to acknowledge copyright for works created with AI, given that AI learns from existing data, the rights to which belong to other people, challenging the attribution of ownership. The practice for addressing this issue is expected to develop next year, facilitated by public participation through <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/policy/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="state-conducted surveys">state-conducted surveys</a>. Resolving this matter independently is now difficult without broader public engagement.” </em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/2023-year-in-review/2023-the-year-in-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="">McKinsey</a>&nbsp;also released a comprehensive graph capturing the most important AI governance-related policy and regulatory efforts in 2023. The visual representation highlights the significant contributions of 2023 in shaping the legal landscape of AI.</p>

    <p>
      December 2023
    </p>

    <p>
      As part of a backup script for my entire system I wanted to back up all my git repositories.
      Some of them don't have a remote anywhere, so I cannot rely on implicit backups in The Cloud.
      The naive solution of simply backing up the entire file-system tree is clearly not desirable since that would clutter the backup with useless build artifacts.
      One solution is to create a fresh clone (with <kbd>--mirror</kbd>), but that will typically consist of many small files which isn't ideal for backups, either.
      Conveniently git can create a single-file archive of a repository via <kbd>git bundle create</kbd> which appears to be the perfect fit for backups.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a few test runs of my backup I noticed that a small but fixed subset of repositories are getting backed up despite having no changes made.
      That is odd because I would think that repeated bundling of the same repository state should create the exact same bundle. However:
    </p>

    <pre>$ git bundle create -q /tmp/a --all
$ git bundle create -q /tmp/b --all
$ md5sum /tmp/a /tmp/b
44891a87b08b75c1b518889fcba73204  /tmp/a
a37a81710313cdbb5f065ddb2c797630  /tmp/b</pre>

    <p>
      Huh?
    </p>
    <p>
      Turns out that for <em>some repositories</em> bundling is nondeterministic.
      After browsing some vaguely-related Stackoverflow answers and several AI hallucinations later I decided to dig into the bundles to see what the differences are.
      Bundling reorganizes all git objects into a single <em>pack</em>, which is an internal git data structure to aggregate many objects into one file and apply some optimizations like delta coding along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both bundles contained a single pack in my case but each pack had a fairly different structure, as revealed by <kbd>git verify-pack -v</kbd>!
      At this point, having looked at many outputs from <kbd>git bundle create</kbd>, I had a suspicion:
    </p>

    <pre>Enumerating objects: 733, done.
Counting objects: 100% (733/733), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (598/598), done.
Writing objects: 100% (733/733), 97.15 KiB | 6.48 MiB/s, done.
Total 733 (delta 419), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0</pre>

    <p>
      What caught my eye was <kbd>Delta compression using up to 8 threads</kbd>—parallelism is a classic source of inherent (as opposed to accidental) nondeterminism.
      Testing this hypothesis should be quite simple.
      Having browsed my fair share of git manpages in the past I knew that many commands have a <kbd>--threads</kbd> option, but git bundle does not.
      Luckily any git subcommand can be run with ad-hoc configuration options, and the relevant option here turns out to be <kbd>pack.threads</kbd>.
    </p>

    <pre>$ for i in $(seq 1 100); do \
&gt; git -c 'pack.threads=1' bundle create -q /tmp/bundle-$i --all; \
&gt; done
$ md5sum /tmp/bundle-* | cut -f 1 -d ' ' | uniq -c
    100 4898971d4d3b8ddd59022d28c467ffca</pre>

    <p>
      Success!
    </p>
    <p>
      Forcing git to be single threaded makes the output deterministic.
      In case you are wondering, using just one thread instead of eight does not have any discernible performance impact on my personal repositories, so I'm very happy to trade performance for reproducibility.

<p><span>Feature</span> Digging into stories of 1980s OSes, a forgotten war for the future of computing emerges. It was won by the lowest bidders, and then the poor users and programmers forgot it ever happened.</p>
<p>Retrocomputing is a substantial, and still growing, interest for many techies and hobbyists, and has been for a decade or two now. There's only so much you can write about a game that's decades old, but operating systems and the different paths they've taken still have rich veins to be explored.</p>
<p>Anyone who played with 1980s computers remembers the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/07/24/amiga_turns_30/">Amiga versus the Atari ST</a> and other battles. But digging down past the stratum of cheap home computers and gaming reveals bigger, more profound differences. The winners of the battles got to write the histories, as they always do, and that means that what is now received wisdom, shared and understood by almost everyone, contains and conceals propaganda and dogma. Things that were once just marketing BS are now holy writ, and when you discover how the <em>other</em> side saw it, dogma is uncovered as just big fat lies.</p>
<h3>The biggest lie</h3>
<p>The first of the big lies is the biggest, but it's also one of the simplest, one that you've probably never questioned.</p>
<p>It's this: <em>Computers today are better than they have ever been before.</em> Not just that they have thousands of times more storage and more speed, but that everything, the whole stack – hardware, operating systems, networking, programming languages and libraries and apps – are better than ever.</p>

    

<p>The myth is that early computers were simple, and they were replaced by better ones that could do more. Gradually, they evolved, getting more sophisticated and more capable, until now, we have multi-processor multi-gigabyte supercomputers in our pockets.</p>

        


        

<p>Which gives me an excuse to use my favorite German quote, generally attributed to physicist Wolfgang Pauli: "Das ist nicht nur nicht richtig; es ist nicht einmal falsch!" (That is not only not right, it is not even wrong!)</p>
<p>Though probably apocryphal, someone asked John Glenn, America's first person in space, what it felt like just before launch. Supposedly, he replied: "I felt about as good as anybody would, sitting in a capsule above a rocket that were both built by the lowest bidder."</p>

        

<p>Well, that is where we are today.</p>
<p>The story about evolution is totally wrong. What really happened is that, time after time, each generation of computers developed until it was very capable and sophisticated, and then it was totally replaced by a new generation of relatively simple, stupid ones. Then those were improved, usually completely ignoring all the lessons learned in the previous generation, until the new generation gets replaced in turn by something smaller, cheaper, and far more stupid.</p>
<h3>Evolution</h3>
<p>The first computers, of course, were huge room-sized things that cost millions. They evolved into mainframes: very big, very expensive, but a whole company could share one, running batch jobs submitted on punched cards and stuff like that.</p>
<p>After a couple of decades, mainframes were replaced by minicomputers, shrunk to the size of filing cabinets, but cheap enough for a mere department to afford. They were also fast enough that multiple users could use them <em>at the same time</em>, using interactive terminals.</p>
<p>All the mainframes' intelligent peripherals, networked to their CPUs, and their sophisticated, hypervisor-based, operating systems, with rich role-based security just thrown away.</p>

        

<p>Then, it gets more complicated. The conventional story, for those who have looked back to the 1970s, is that microcomputers came along, based on cheap single-chip microprocessors, and swept away minicomputers. Then they gradually evolved until they caught up.</p>
<p>But that's not really true.</p>
<p>First, and less visibly because they were so expensive, department-scale minicomputers shrank down to desk-sized, and then desk-side, and later desk-<strong>top</strong>, <em>workstations</em>. Instead of being shared by a department, these were single-user machines. Very powerful, very expensive, but just about affordable for one person – as long as they were someone important enough.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, though, in the course of being shrunk down to single-user boxes, most of their ancestors' departmental-scale sophistication was thrown away. Rich file systems, with built-in version tracking, because hard disks cost as much as cars: gone. Clustering, enabling a handful of machines costing hundreds of thousands to work as a seamless whole? Not needed, gone. Rich built-in groupware, enabling teams to cooperate and work on shared documents? Forgotten. Plain-text email was enough.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, down at the budget end and at the same time as these tens-of-thousands-of-dollar single-user workstations, dumb terminals evolved into microcomputers. Every computer in the world today is, at heart, a "micro."</p>
<p>At first, they were feeble. They could hardly do anything. So, this time around, we lost <em>tons</em> of stuff.</p>
<p>Hard disks? Too expensive. Dropped. Multitasking? Not enough memory. Removed. Choice of programming languages? Retained in the 1970s CP/M machines, then when they got cheaper still in the early '80s, dropped: kids don't need that. Shove BASIC in a ROM, that will do. The machines mostly got used for playing games anyway.</p>
<p>Early micros could handle floppy disk drives and had a DOS, but over the longer run, even those got eliminated: too expensive. Instead, you got an audio cassette recorder.</p>
<h3>How we got here</h3>
<p>Those early-1980s micros, the weakest, feeblest, most pathetic computers since the first 1940s mainframes, the early eight-bit micros, <em>those</em> are the ancestors of the computers you use today.</p>
<p>In fact, of all the early 1980s computers, the one with the most boring, unoriginal design, the one with <em>no</em> graphics and <em>no</em> sound – that, with a couple of exceptions, is the ancestor of what you use today. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2007/11/17/tob_ibm_personal_computer/">The IBM PC</a>, which got expanded and enhanced over and over again to catch up and eventually, over about 15 years, exceed the abilities of its cheaper but cleverer rivals.</p>
<p>It is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollo%27s_law_of_irreversibility" rel="nofollow">a sort of law of nature</a> that when you try to replace features that you eliminated, the result is never as good as if you designed it in at the beginning.</p>
<p>We run the much-upgraded descendants of the simplest, stupidest, and most boring computer that anyone could get to market. They were the easiest to build and to get working. Easy means cheap, and cheap sells more and makes more profit. So they are the ones that won.</p>
<p>There's a proverb about choosing a product: "You can have good, fast, and cheap. Choose any two!"</p>
<p>We got "fast" and "cheap." We lost "good", replaced by "reliable," which is definitely a virtue, but one that comes with an extremely high price.</p>
<h3>What we lost</h3>
<p>Like many a middle-aged geek, there was a time when I collected 1980s hardware, because what was inaccessible when it was new – because I couldn't afford it – was being given away for free. However, it got bulky and I gave most of it away, focusing on battery-powered portable kit instead, partly because it's interesting in its own way, and partly because it doesn't take up much room. You don't need to keep big screens and keyboards around.</p>
<p>That led me to an interesting machine: the <em>other</em> line of Apple computers, the ones that Steve Jobs had no hand in at all.</p>
<p>The machine that inspired Jobs, which led to the Lisa and then the Mac, was of course <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/16/the_xerox_alto_50_years/">the Xerox Alto</a>, a $30,000 deskside workstation. In Jobs' own words, he saw three amazing technologies that day, but he was so dazzled by one of them that he missed the other two. He was so impressed by the GUI that he missed the object-oriented graphical programming language, Smalltalk, and the Alto's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/30/ethernet_50th_birthday/">built-in ubiquitous networking, Ethernet</a>.</p>
<p>The Lisa had none of that. The Mac had less. Apple spent much of the next 20 years trying to put them back. In that time, Steve Jobs hired John Sculley from PepsiCo to run Apple, and in return, Sculley fired Jobs. What Apple came up with during Sculley's reign was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2010/07/26/newton_messagepad_120/">the Newton</a>.</p>
<p>I have two Newtons, an Original MessagePad and a 2100. I love them. They're a vision of a different future. But I never used them much: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2014/03/07/bugger_my_jetpack_wheres_my_21stcentury_psion/?page=2">I used Psions</a>, which had a far simpler and less ambitious design, meaning that they were cheaper but did the job. This should be an industry proverb.</p>
<p>The Newton that shipped was a pale shadow of the Newton that Apple originally planned. There are traces of that machine out there, though, and that's what led to me uncovering the great computing war.</p>
<p>The Newton was – indeed, still is – a radical machine. It's designed to live in your pocket, store and track your information and habits. It had an address book, a diary, a note-taking app, astonishing handwriting recognition, and a primitive AI assistant. You could write "lunch with Alice" on the screen, and it would work out what you wrote, analyze it, work out from your diary when you normally had lunch, from your call history where you took lunch most often and which Alice you contacted most often, book a time slot in your diary and send her a message to ask her if she'd like to come.</p>
<p>It was something like Siri, but 20 years earlier, and in that time, Apple seems to have forgotten all this: It had to buy Siri in.</p>
<p>NewtonOS also had no file system. I don't mean it wasn't visible to the user; I mean there wasn't one. It had some non-volatile memory on board, expandable via memory cards – huge PCMCIA ones the size of half-centimetre-thick credit cards – and it kept stuff in a sort of OS-integrated object database, segregated by function. The stores were called "soups" and the OS kept track of what was stored where. No file names, no directories, nothing like that at all.</p>
<p>Apps, and some of the OS itself, were written in a language called NewtonScript, which is very distantly related to both AppleScript on modern macOS and JavaScript. But that was not the original plan. That was for a far more radical OS, in a more radical language, one that could be developed in an astounding graphical environment.</p>
<p>The language was called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/1992/09/dylan_a_new_language.html" rel="nofollow">Dylan</a>, which is short for Dynamic Language. It <a target="_blank" href="https://opendylan.org/" rel="nofollow">still exists</a> as a FOSS compiler. Apple seems to have forgotten about it too, because it reinvented that wheel, worse, with Swift.</p>
<p>Have a look. Dylan is amazing, and its <a target="_blank" href="https://opendylan.org/history/apple-dylan/eulogy.html" rel="nofollow">SK8 IDE</a> even more so (a few <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/2625-apple-sk8" rel="nofollow">screenshots and downloads</a> are left). Dylan is very readable, very high-level, and before the commercial realities of time and money prevailed, Apple planned to write an OS, and the apps for that OS, in Dylan.</p>
<p>Now <em>that</em> is radical: Using the same, very high-level, language for both the OS and the apps. It was feasible because Dylan is built as a layer on top of one of the oldest programming languages that's still in active use, Lisp.</p>
<p>Both Smalltalk and Lisp are very much still around. For both, there are commercial and FOSS versions. Both can run on the .NET CLR and on the JVM. There's even a Smalltalk that <a target="_blank" href="https://amber-lang.net/" rel="nofollow">runs in your browser</a> on the JavaScript engine. The primary text editor of the Lisp environment is still widely used today, mostly by old-timers.</p>
<p>But these are only traces. They are faint memorials left after the war. Because once, these things were not just slightly weird languages that ran on commodity OSes.</p>
<h3>They were OSes in their own right</h3>
<p>I started digging into that, and that's when the ground crumbled away, and I found that, like some very impressive CGI special effects, I wasn't excavating a graveyard but a whole, hidden, ruined city.</p>
<p>Once, Lisp ran on the bare metal, on purpose-built computers that ran operating systems written in Lisp, ones with GUIs that could connect to the internet.</p>
<p>And if you find the people who used Lisp machines ... wow. They loved them, with a passion that makes Amiga owners look like, well, amateurs, hobbyists. This level of advocacy makes Vi versus Emacs look like a playground squabble.</p>
<p>Some of the references are easy to find. There's a wonderful book called <a target="_blank" href="https://web.mit.edu/~simsong/www/ugh.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Unix-Haters Handbook</a> [PDF] which I highly recommend. It's easy to read and genuinely funny. It's a digest of a long-running internet community from the time when universities were getting rid of Lisp machines and replacing them with cheaper, faster Unix workstations – Sun boxes and things like that.</p>
<p>Lisp machine users were not impressed. For them, Unix was a huge step <em>backwards</em>. The code was all compiled, whereas Lisp OSes ran a sort of giant shared dynamic environment (it's hard to explain something when the words for it have been lost). On a Unix machine, if you didn't like the way a program did something, you had to go find the source code, edit it, save it in a new file, compile that file, restart the program to try it ... and if it worked, find your existing binary, and replace it with the new one. Then you would probably find that you'd made a mistake and it didn't work, and try again.</p>
<p>This is why, apart from the hardcore Gentoo users, we all outsource this stuff to OS vendors and Linux distributors.</p>
<p>On the Lisp machines, your code wasn't trapped inside frozen blocks. You could just edit the live running code and the changes would take effect immediately. You could inspect or even change the values of variables, as the code ran. Developer and blogger Steve Yegge called it "<a target="_blank" href="https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/01/pinocchio-problem.html" rel="nofollow">living software</a>."</p>
<p>Lisp machines booted slowly, but that didn't matter much because you rarely cold booted them. At the end of the day, the OS wrote the values of all its objects and variables to disk – called "saving a world" – and then just stopped. When you turned it back on, it reread these values into memory, and resumed exactly where it was.</p>
<p>Most of this, incidentally, also applies to Smalltalk machines. That's why these two are sometimes called <a target="_blank" href="http://onsmalltalk.com/languages-of-the-gods" rel="nofollow">languages of the gods</a>.</p>
<p><em>This</em> is what Steve Jobs missed. He was distracted by the shiny. He brought the world the GUI, but he got his team to reimplement it on top of fairly conventional OSes, originally in a mixture of assembly and Pascal.</p>
<p>He left behind the amazing rich development environment, where it was objects all the way down.</p>
<h3>And we never got it back</h3>
<p>We got networking back, sure, but not this.</p>
<p>Now Lisp and Smalltalk are just niche languages – but once, both of them were whole other universes. Full-stack systems, all live, all dynamic, all editable on the fly.</p>
<p>The closest thing we have today is probably JavaScript apps running in web browsers, and they are crippled little things by comparison.</p>
<p>The difference, though, is where the biggest losses in the war came.</p>
<p>Smalltalk machines ran on relatively normal processors. Smalltalk is all about objects, and you can't really handle objects at hardware level.</p>
<p>(Well, you <em>can</em> – a very expensive Hi-Fi manufacturer called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/10/jony_ive_linn_turntable/">Linn</a> tried with a machine called the Rekursiv, but it flopped badly. So did Intel's attempt to do a chip that implemented high-level stuff in hardware – not the Itanium, no, long before that, the iAPX 432.)</p>
<p>But <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lispmachine.net/" rel="nofollow">Lisp machines</a> ran on dedicated chips, and this is where stuff gets real. As in, the <em>stuff</em> that hits the fan.</p>
<p>There were several big vendors of Lisp machines. As <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/23/medley_interlisp_revival/">we covered recently</a>, Xerox sold them, and its Lisp OS is now FOSS.</p>
<p>But the bigger one, and the most influential, was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ifis.uni-luebeck.de/~moeller/symbolics-info/index.html" rel="nofollow">Symbolics</a>. At risk of sounding like a hipster, "you've probably never heard of it." Forgotten as it is now, as an indication of how significant the company was, it owned <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2008/dec/22/internet-domains" rel="nofollow">the first ever dot-com domain</a> on the internet. It launched in 1980 with a commercial version of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/31/mit_cadr_software_recovered/">MIT CADR Lisp machine</a>, and made dedicated Lisp hardware until 1993.</p>

<p>The company's dead, but the OS, OpenGenera, is still <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/OpenGenera" rel="nofollow">out there</a> and you can <a target="_blank" href="https://jaoswald.blogspot.com/2020/05/open-genera-vlm-on-linux.html" rel="nofollow">run it on an emulator</a> on Linux. It's the end result of several decades of totally separate evolution from the whole Mac/Windows/Unix world, so it's kind of arcane, but it's out there.</p>
<p>There are a lot of accounts of the power and the productivity possible in Lisp and on Lisp machines.</p>
<p>One of the more persuasive is from a man called Kalman Reti, the last working Symbolics engineer. So loved are these machines that people are still working on their 30-year-old hardware, and Reti maintains them. He's made some YouTube videos demonstrating OpenGenera on Linux.</p>
<p>He <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bw4Wz8Ir0pl1cmNRaHYwdU1wdXM/" rel="nofollow">talks about</a> [video] the process of implementing the single-chip Lisp machine processors.</p>

<p>Now that is significant.</p>
<p>When different people tell you that they can achieve such a huge differential in productivity – one tenth of the people taking one tenth of the time to do the same job – you have to pay attention.</p>

<h3>'Better is the enemy of good'</h3>
<p>I am <em>not</em> here to tell you that Lisp machines were some ultimate super workstation. An environment that is mostly semi-interpreted code, running in a single shared memory space, is not very stable ... and when it crashes, if you don't have a snapshot to go back to, you have pain in store.</p>
<p>The point here is not that this long-gone technology was better in every way. It wasn't. But it did have advantages, and it's instructive to look at some of these that were shared by both Lisp and Smalltalk machines.</p>
<p>They were written in one language, or mostly in one, all the way down. As original Smalltalk implementer Dan Ingalls put it: "An operating system is a collection of things that don't fit inside a language; there shouldn't be one."</p>
<p>They had a pervasive model of data, all the way down the stack. In Smalltalk, everything is objects. In Lisp, everything is lists. What the Unix&nbsp;model offers by comparison is weak stuff: Everything is a file.</p>
<h3>More big lies</h3>
<p>The Unix model of computation was designed in response to Multics, the original all-singing, all-dancing 1960s OS. Unix was intended, in contrast, to be the ultimate in minimalism (although it very much&nbsp;is not anymore).</p>
<p>This shows up another of the big lies that everyone just takes as read, but this one has layers like a cabbage:</p>
<ul>
<li>For speed, you need a language that's close to the metal. That means it must be very simple. This has costs, but they're worth it: the programmer must manually manage their memory, meaning that they must be very, <em>very</em> careful.</li>

<li>But that's hard, so to keep life easier, you layer simpler languages on top. Early on, AWK and SED and so on; later, Perl and Python; then later still, runtimes such as the JVM and WASM, and languages on top of that, such as Clojure or Scala.</li>

<li>As the stack matures, it grows ever more layers. The higher layers are ever further from the metal.</li>

<li>Many of these languages are much easier but slower. In the old days, you needed to rewrite code in a lower-level language for speed, such as C++. So what if it's huge? You don't need all of it! So what if it's hard to read? It was hard to write!</li>

<li>Then, in time, computers keep getting faster, so you can retain the inefficient implementation and keep going.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result is a folk belief that there is a necessary, implicit contrast between "readable" and "fast." This is one of the big assumptions behind both the Unix and Windows schools of OS design, that different languages are best for different jobs, and so you need a mixture of them. That means that the layers are sealed off from one another, because of different models of variable storage, of memory management, etc.</p>
<p>That's one big lie.</p>
<p>Firstly, because the layers are <em>not</em> sealed off: higher-level languages are usually implemented in lower-level ones, and vulnerabilities in those permeate the stack.</p>
<p>For instance, a common way of trying to make stuff safer is to wrap it in a runtime or VM, but that doesn't solve the problem, it creates new ones. Problem: The language eliminates whole types of error, but they persist in the VM. Problem: Now, your code is dependent on the performance of the VM. Problem: Try to fix either of these, you risk breaking the code. Problem: Because the VM isn't part of the OS, you end up with multiple VMs, all sharing these issues.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.millersville.edu/bikenaga/math-proof/existence-proofs/existence-proofs.html" rel="nofollow">existence&nbsp;proof</a> that multiple projects and products, successful in their time, show that if you pick the right language, you can built your entire stack all in one.</p>
<p>Lisp code is structured as lists, which is the data structure that Lisp is designed to manipulate. That is the reason for its <a target="_blank" href="https://toggl.com/blog/save-princess-8-programming-languages" rel="nofollow">legendary plethora of parentheses</a>. It also makes it very easy to write macros that manipulate program code, meaning programs can modify themselves. This sort of thing is why Neal Stephenson <a target="_blank" href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs81n/command.txt" rel="nofollow">referred to it</a> thus:</p>

<p>It is highly readable, and vastly powerful. Alan Kay, the designer of Smalltalk, <a target="_blank" href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1039523" rel="nofollow">said of Lisp</a>:</p>

<p>These are powerful qualities – but possibly only to a certain type of mind.</p>
<p>Dylan, however, shows that it need not be like that. If you lose the list-based notation, yes, there is a price in efficiency and power, but the result is readable by mere mortals. Dylan was not the only attempt to do this. There are quite a few – <a target="_blank" href="http://users.rcn.com/david-moon/PLOT/" rel="nofollow">PLOT</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/41951" rel="nofollow">CGOL</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://readable.sourceforge.io/" rel="nofollow">sweet expressions</a>, the cancelled <a target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1464291.1464362" rel="nofollow">Lisp 2 project</a>, and more.</p>
<p>The plan was that the Newton would be a Dylan-based Lisp machine in your pocket. The Newton was Sculley's baby. Jobs didn't invent it, so he didn't like it, derided it as a "<a target="_blank" href="https://allthingsd.com/20120113/former-apple-ceo-says-newton-scribble-thing-was-15-years-ahead-of-its-time/" rel="nofollow">scribble thing</a>," and on his return to Apple he killed it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.loper-os.org/?p=568" rel="nofollow">along with Hypercard</a>.</p>
<p>In 1993, the Newton was Apple's first Arm-powered computer, a CPU architecture it returned to 17 years later. It was planned to be the a pocket Lisp workstation, and it launched the same year that Symbolics quit making Lisp processors and <a target="_blank" href="http://pt.withington.org/publications/VLM.pdf" rel="nofollow">moved to the DEC Alpha</a> [PDF] instead.</p>
<p>In the end, the big fight was between dedicated hardware, with custom processors running custom operating systems, versus a shared, lowest-common-denominator technology: UNIX, running at first on off-the-shelf chips such as the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=960" rel="nofollow">Sun-1's Motorola 68000</a> and later on RISC chips such as Sun's SPARC and the MIPS R2000, launched the same year as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/21/risc_os_35/">Acorn's RISC OS 2 on its ARM chips</a>. A cross-platform OS, its development sponsored by Bell Labs and refined at the University of California, compiled from source written in a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/05/15/algol_60_at_60/">cut-down form of BCPL</a>.</p>
<p>As is usually the way, the cheaper, simpler solution won. Commodity chips were replaced with faster RISC chips, broadly speaking designed to run compiled C code efficiently. Then, decades later, the PC caught up: 32-bit x86 processors became comparable in performance to the RISC chips, and we ended up with a few varieties of Unix on x86, plus Windows NT. Unix, of course, was originally developed on the DEC PDP-7, moved to the PDP-11, and later its 32-bit successor the VAX. Windows NT, meanwhile, was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/30/arm_intel_comment/">designed by the chief architect</a> of the VAX's native OS, VMS. That's why it's so visibly influenced by it. Instead of DEC's BLISS language, NT is implemented in Unix's native language, C.</p>
<p>From the perspective of a Smalltalk or Lisp machine, they are siblings, almost twins, with deep roots in DEC. They are representatives of a school of design called the "New Jersey approach" by Lisp luminary Richard Gabriel in his essay "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/LispGoodNewsBadNews.pdf" rel="nofollow">Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big</a>" [PDF]. He compares it to what he calls the "MIT approach," and his summary of the New Jersey way is called "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html" rel="nofollow">Worse is Better</a>."</p>
<p>It's well worth reading at least the summary, but the key points are this.</p>

<p>He continues:</p>

<p>The conclusion, though, is the stinger:</p>

<p>Time has certainly proved Dr Gabriel correct. Systems of the New Jersey school so dominate the modern computing industry that the <em>other</em> way of writing software is banished to a tiny niche.</p>
<p>Smalltalk&nbsp;evolved into Self, which begat JavaScript, which in the hands of a skilled Smalltalker <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/23/croquet_for_unity/">can do amazing things</a> – but only its visual design transformed the computer industry.</p>
<p>The Lisp text editor is now just one of the more arcane options on Linux boxes. Lisp itself is a fringe programming language, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" rel="nofollow">beloved by some industry heroes</a> but ignored by most – even those who <a target="_blank" href="https://flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html" rel="nofollow">need the very best tools</a>. As one famous Lisp programmer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.marktarver.com/bipolar.html" rel="nofollow">put it</a>:</p>

<p>If you want to become a billionaire from software, you don't want rockstar geniuses; you need <a target="_blank" href="http://www.loper-os.org/?p=69" rel="nofollow">fungible cogs</a>, interchangeable and inexpensive.</p>
<p>Software built with tweezers and glue is not robust, no matter how many layers you add. It's terribly fragile, and needs armies of workers constantly fixing its millions of cracks and holes.</p>
<p>There was once a better way, but it lost out to cold hard cash, and now, only a few historians even remember it existed. ®</p>
<h3>Bootnote</h3>
<p>For a look at a Lisp machine in action, as well as BTRON and IBM i, this talk from the Chaos Computer Congress entitled "<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://media.ccc.de/v/rc3-525180-what_have_we_lost#l=eng&amp;t=0">What have we lost?</a>" is worth a watch.</p>

<p>Matter, as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/matter-and-thread-could-fix-smart-home-compatibility-but-dont-get-excited-yet/">a smart home standard</a>, would make everything about owning a smart home better. Devices could be set up with any phone, for either remote or local control, put onto any major platform (like Alexa, Google, or HomeKit) or combinations of them, and avoid being orphaned if their device maker goes out of business. Less fragmentation, more security, fewer junked devices: win, win, win.</p>
<p>Matter, as it exists in late 2023, more than a year after its 1.0 specification was published and just under a year after the first devices came online, is more like the <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">xkcd scenario</a> that lots of people might have expected. It's another home automation standard at the moment, and one that isn't particularly better than the others, at least how it works today. I wish it was not so.</p>
<p>Setting up a Matter device isn't easy, nor is making it work across home systems. Lots of devices with Matter support still require you to download their maker's specific app to get full functionality. Even if you were an early adopting, Matter-T-shirt-wearing enthusiast, you're still buying devices that don't work quite as well, and still generally require a major tech company's gear to act as your bridge or router.</p>

<h2>Lights that Matter, but do less</h2>
<p>Jennifer Pattison Tuohy at The Verge has done more Matter writing, and testing, than just about anybody out there who doesn't work for the Connectivity Standards Alliance that oversees the spec. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23997548/matter-smart-home-2023-platforms">she puts it</a>:</p>                                            
                                                        
<blockquote><p>I’ve been testing Matter devices all year, and it has been the most frustrating year of my decade-plus experience with smart home devices. Twelve months in, I do not have one Matter-based device working reliably in my home. To make matters worse (yeah, I know), the one system that’s always been rock solid, my Philips Hue smart lights, is basically unusable in any of my smart home platforms since I moved it to Matter.</p></blockquote>
<p>When the Matter upgrade for Hue lights rolled out in September, I didn't move to switch my bulbs over. For one thing, it wouldn't result in a net loss of limited-purpose hardware (i.e. hubs). If you wanted to move your Hue bulbs over to Matter and control them through Google's Home app, you'd need a Google Home Hub or Home Mini to act as a Matter bridge device. The same goes for Alexa (Echo devices), Samsung SmartThings (a Hub), or Apple Home (an Apple TV or HomePod/mini). You also lose some Hue-specific function, like gradient lighting and scenes (like holiday green/red schemes). And, as Tuohy has noted, it's likely not a more reliable network than the proprietary Zigbee setup that Hue ran on before.</p>
<p>The smart home and automation market is like that pretty much everywhere. Aqara offers a <a href="https://www.aqara.com/en/product/led-strip-t1/">Matter-compliant light strip, the T1</a>, but it requires a hub, and using Matter means you can't use Apple's light-sensing adaptive brightness, because Matter doesn't support that yet. The same goes for Nanoleaf's Matter-friendly <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1JD5YXW/?tag=arstech20-20">bulbs</a> and <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/essentials/lightstrips/?category=lightstrips&amp;standard=matter&amp;pack=smarter-kit&amp;size=2">strips</a>, which are Matter and Thread capable but require Nanoleaf's own app to provide Nanoleaf's version of adaptive lighting.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p><span>Patents are supposed to be an incentive to invent. Too often, they end up being a way to try to claim “ownership” of what should be basic building blocks of human activity, culture, and knowledge. This is especially true of </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/patents"><span>software patents</span></a><span>, an area EFF has been speaking out about for more than 20 years now.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This month’s Stupid Patent, No. </span><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US8655715B2/"><span>8,655,715</span></a><span>, continues the tradition of trying to use software language to capture a monopoly on a basic human cultural activity–in this case, contests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A company called Opus One, which does business under the name “Contest Factory,” claims this patent and </span><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10891642B2/en"><span>a related one</span></a><span> cover a huge array of online contests. So far, they’ve filed five lawsuits against other companies that help build online contests, and even threatened a small photo company that organizes mostly non-commercial contests online.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The patents held by Contest Factory are a good illustration of why EFF has been concerned about out-of-control software patents. It’s not just that wrongly issued patents extort a vast tax on the U.S. economy (although they do—one study </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2014/07/the-evidence-is-in-patent-trolls-do-hurt-innovation"><span>estimated $29 billion in annual direct costs</span></a><span>). The worst software patents also harm peoples’ rights to express themselves and participate in online culture. Just as we’re free in the physical world to </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/01/stupid-patent-month-digital-verification-systems-patents-e-signatures"><span>sign documents</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/12/how-patent-sorting-photos-got-used-sue-free-software-group"><span>sort photos</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/10/east-texas-judge-throws-out-168-patent-cases-in-one-fell-swoop/"><span>store and label information</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/02/stupid-patent-month-clocking-work-app"><span>clock in to work</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/05/patent-troll-uses-ridiculous-people-finder-patent-sue-small-dating-companies"><span>find people to date</span></a><span>, or </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/07/effs-help-language-teacher-responds-ridiculous-patent-threat"><span>teach foreign languages</span></a><span>, without paying extortionate fees to others, we must also be free to do so online.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong><span>Patenting Contests</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>Claim 1 of the ‘715 patent has steps that claim:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Receiving, storing, and accessing data on a computer;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Sorting it and generating “contest data”;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Tabulating votes and picking a winner.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The patent also uses other terms for common activities of general purpose computers, such as “transmitting” and “displaying” data.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In other words, the patent describes everyday use of computers, plus the idea of users participating in a contest. This is a classic abstract idea, and it never should have been eligible for a patent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In a </span><a href="https://gamification.cioreview.com/vendor/2017/contest_factory"><span>2017 article in CIO Review</span></a><span>, the company acknowledges how incredibly broad its claims are. Contest Factory claims it patented “voting in online contests long before TV contest shows with public voting components made their appearance,” and that it holds patents “associated with online contests and integrating online voting with virtually any type of contest.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Lawsuit Over Radio Station Contest&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><span>In its most recent lawsuit, Contest Factory says that a Minneapolis radio station’s “Mother’s Day Giveaway” for a mother/daughter spa day infringed its patent. The radio station asked people to post mother-daughter selfies online and share their entry to collect votes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Contest Factory sued Pancake Labs (</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/document/contest-factory-v-pancake-labs"><span>complaint</span></a><span>), the company that helped the radio station put the contest online. Contest Factory also claimed a </span><a href="https://www.shortstack.com/blog/how-pbs-maximizes-shortstacks-scalability-versatility-and-customizability-when-creating-digital-marketing-campaigns"><span>PBS contest</span></a><span> in which viewers created short films and voted on them was an example of infringement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the “Mother’s Day Giveaway” contest, the patent infringement accusation reads in part that, “the executable instructions … cause the generation of a contest and the transmission of the first and second content data to at least one user to view and rate the content.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Contest Factory has sued over quite a few internet contests, dating back more than a decade. Its 2016 lawsuits, based on the ‘715 patent and two earlier related patents,&nbsp;were filed against three small online marketing firms: Vancouver-based </span><a href="https://www.strutta.com/about/"><span>Strutta</span></a><span>, Florida-based </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/elettro"><span>Elettro</span></a><span>, and California-based </span><a href="https://www.votigo.com/"><span>Votigo</span></a><span>, for contests that go back to 2011. We don’t know how many more companies or online communities have been threatened in all.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sharing user-generated content like photos—cooperatively or competitively—is the kind of sharing that the digital world is ideal for. When patent owners demand a toll for these activities, it doesn’t matter whether they’re patent “trolls” or operating companies seeking to extract settlements from competitors. They threaten our freedoms in unacceptable ways.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The government shouldn’t be issuing patents like these, and it certainly shouldn’t be making them </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/11/publics-right-fight-bad-patents-must-be-protected"><span>harder to challenge</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>Opus One d/b/a Contest Factory v. Pancake Labs </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/document/contest-factory-v-pancake-labs"><span>complaint</span></a></li>
<li><span>Opus One d/b/a Contest Factory v. Telescope </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/document/contest-factory-v-telescope"><span>complaint&nbsp;</span></a></li>

<p>Companies increasingly aim to control how users interact with their 
content online, threatening user freedom. As more companies crack down 
on browser extensions and other third-party software used by internet 
users to customise their experiences, two recent German court cases on 
adblockers could strengthen the legal case for user control over 
technology.</p>

<p>Advertisements are a part of our lives, including our digital ones. 
They are in the websites we browse, the search results we receive, and 
the online news we read. Tired of receiving so many ads, some users try 
to avoid them by installing an adblocker. But is this a legal practice? 
Is using adblockers an act of restricting market autonomy, or do they 
help achieve user freedom?</p>

<p>Imagine a scenario where website owners hold copyright over their 
websites, including whatever ads they place, and could effectively sue 
for copyright infringement if users were to remove or suppress ads when 
visiting these websites. This hypothetical situation would enable any 
website copyright holder to use the legal system to stop any ordinary 
user on the internet who tries to bypass these ads. This would 
lead to an internet where unsolicited information 
and advertisements are imposed on users. Fortunately, recent court 
decisions have at least prevented this hypothetical from becoming a 
reality in Germany.</p> 

<h2 id="id-is-it-legal-to-use-adblockers-the-lawsuit-in-question">Is it legal to use adblockers? The lawsuit in question</h2>

<p>Using an adblocker is the main way in which many internet users 
bypass ads and pop-ups when accessing websites. Adblockers usually come 
in the form of browser extensions and plugins that filter out unwanted 
ads for an ad-free internet browsing experience.</p> 

<p>As the use of these adblockers increases, some companies have begun 
considering whether it is legal for  users to be able to block their 
ads. This was the case in Germany when Axel Springer SE (Axel 
Springer), one of Germany’s largest publishing companies, engaged in 
lawsuits against Eyeo GmbH (Eyeo), the creator of <a href="https://adblockplus.org/en/about#whymoney">Adblock Plus</a> (a 
Free 
Software adblocking tool licensed under the GPLv3). These lawsuits have 
resulted in a legal battle for user freedom and an open internet.</p>

<p>In the case of Adblock Plus, ads are blocked according to filter rules 
maintained in a so-called “black list”, which users use as a default 
setting. The extension offers ad providers the possibility of having 
their ads excluded from this black list (and included in a “white 
list”) by complying with <a href="https://acceptableads.com/standard/">“acceptable advertising 
standards”,</a> disclosing 
their annual turnover, and paying a sum to Eyeo. Users will only see 
ads that have been included in the white list, but they also have the 
option of blocking ads from both white and black lists altogether.</p>

<div>
<p>Axel Springer filed several suits in Germany against Eyeo on the grounds 
that the Adblock Plus extension interfered with their business, 
alleging that by blocking its advertisements, Eyeo had engaged in 
anti-competitive measures. According to Axel Springer, Eyeo’s business 
model constituted:</p>

<h3 id="id-the-right-not-to-be-advertised-to">The right not to be advertised to</h3> 
<p>After ruling that the option to use adblockers is a decision that internet users should be able to make, 
the courts in Germany ruled that user rights not only include the 
freedom to express an opinion and to receive information, but also the 
rights to refrain from expressing an opinion and to refuse to receive 
imposed information. In doing so, the rulings considered a user’s 
interest in being spared from obtrusive advertising.</p>

<p>Accordingly, internet users are simply exercising their right to not 
have certain forms of advertising displayed when visiting internet 
websites when they choose to make use of an adblocker. Adblock Plus’s 
business model, according to the courts, was therefore a marketable 
service offer which was not primarily aimed at impairing the 
competitive development of Axel Springer. In the opinion of the courts, 
Adblock Plus also does not directly interfere with the business, as 
users retain autonomy to do as they wish with the settings of the 
add-on after installation. Users can block or wish to see only the ads 
in the whitelist. Adblock Plus is therefore merely a product whose use 
is decided solely by the internet user.</p>

<h3 id="id-the-html-argument-does-the-use-of-adblockers-constitute-a-modification-of-a-computer-program">The HTML argument: does the use of adblockers constitute a modification of a computer program?</h3>

<p>Axel Springer also submitted an argument to the German courts that their
websites would be protected under German copyright law as a copyrighted 
computer program, and that their HTML code would similarly be covered 
under this ambit because of the control components it included. Because 
of how Adblock Plus interacts with its website, Axel Springer therefore 
claimed that copies and adaptations of the code in its website were 
violations of copyright made without permission.</p>

<p>In both the initial court ruling and the decision on the subsequent appeal in favour 
of Eyeo, the court disagreed with Axel Springer and held that the use 
of Adblock Plus solely affects the program flow through external 
commands, without altering the program’s essence or generating a 
changed version. Thus, the use of the extension results in a mere 
browser configuration carried out by users according to their 
preferences.</p>

<p>The courts noted that internet users do not require permission from 
website owners when they want to make the website look better for 
themselves. Modern websites are made up of many separate parts that can 
be technically distinguished from each other, including text, images, and 
videos, as well as software that is embedded in the HTML page. For the 
courts, it wasn’t enough that these software components were used in 
the website’s HTML page to mean that the website itself was a 
protectable computer program. We can therefore infer that adblockers 
do not infringe upon a program’s protections.</p>

<h2 id="id-downsides-of-the-case">Downsides of the case</h2> 
<p>Nevertheless, some aspects in the judgments are still not ideal in 
promoting the average user’s rights. While user freedom  means that 
users are able to use the tools that they wish to when browsing the 
World Wide Web, the court nevertheless preserved Axel 
Springer’s right to exclude users with an activated adblocker from 
accessing its content. This can be understood as an approval on the use 
of adblock detection tools by companies like Axel Springer.</p> 

<p>Unfortunately, the court also mentioned that Axel Springer can convert 
its content into a paid access model, justifying this measure as an 
element inherent for competition. We fear that this tacit approval can 
result in paywalls and adblock detection tools becoming the basic 
standard on the internet.</p> 

<p>More importantly, tools to detect the use of adblockers go against <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32002L0058">Art. 
5(3) of the ePrivacy directive</a>, which mandates that websites must seek 
consent before accessing or storing information about a user’s device. 
The EU commission has confirmed that, Art. 5(3) of the ePrivacy directive 
<a href="https://forum.adblockplus.org/viewtopic.php?t=45001">is not 
just limited to cookies but ‘all types of information’ stored or 
accessed</a> in the user’s terminal device. This applies to the storage by 
websites of scripts in users’ terminal equipment to detect if users 
have installed or are using adblockers.</p> 

<h2 id="id-a-win-for-user-freedom">A win for user freedom?</h2> 

<p>With many service providers and websites on the internet following the 
trend of restricting users with adblockers from accessing their services, these court 
decisions in Germany help build precedents that uphold and recognize 
principles of user freedom.</p> 

<p>Indeed, these decisions support the principles of a <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/ngi/ngi.en.html">Next Generation 
Internet</a>, including ensuring that internet users can make individual 
choices and exercise their freedom of expression, in ways in which they 
can freely develop and use new extensions and browser features to 
enhance their online experience and user control.</p>  

<p>Despite the steps forward for user control found in these judgments, 
they do not go as far as we would hope to secure user freedom when 
using the internet, and are still subject to appeals and therefore may 
not be final. We will keep an eye on the legal proceedings in this case 
and keep you updated when new developments occur. In the meantime, the 
court cases can be read on the <a href="https://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=en&amp;nr=8849">Bundesgerichtshof</a> 
and <a href="https://www.landesrecht-hamburg.de/bsha/document/JURE220021753">Landesgerichts</a> 
websites. If you are aware of any similar cases or other developments to 
support user freedom in any other member states in the EU, then please 
do share and reach out to us!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2023-sshpass-without-sshpass">https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2023-sshpass-without-sshpass</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38762214">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="lf-text">

<p>SSH offers several forms of authentication, such as <strong>passwords</strong> and
<strong>public keys</strong>. The latter are considered more secure. However, password
authentication remains prevalent, particularly with network equipment.<sup id="fnref-why"><a href="#fn-why">1</a></sup></p>
<p>A classic solution to avoid typing a password for each connection is
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/sshpass/" title="sshpass: Non-interactive ssh password auth">sshpass</a>, or its more correct variant <a href="https://github.com/clarkwang/passh">passh</a>. Here is a wrapper for <em>Zsh</em>,
getting the password from <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/" title="The standard UNIX password manager">pass</a>, a simple password manager:<sup id="fnref-security"><a href="#fn-security">2</a></sup></p>
<div><pre><span></span>pssh<span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span>passh<span> </span>-p<span> </span>&lt;<span>(</span>pass<span> </span>show<span> </span>network/ssh/password<span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span>head<span> </span>-1<span>)</span><span> </span>ssh<span> </span><span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
compdef<span> </span><span>pssh</span><span>=</span>ssh
</pre></div>


<p>This approach is a bit brittle as it requires to parse the output of the <code>ssh</code>
command to look for a password prompt. Moreover, if no password is required, the
password manager is still invoked. Since <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.4" title="OpenSSH 8.4 release notes">OpenSSH 8.4</a>, we can use
<code>SSH_ASKPASS</code> and <code>SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE</code> instead:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>ssh<span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>set</span><span> </span>-o<span> </span>localoptions<span> </span>-o<span> </span>localtraps
<span>  </span><span>local</span><span> </span><span>passname</span><span>=</span>network/ssh/password
<span>  </span><span>local</span><span> </span><span>helper</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>mktemp<span>)</span>
<span>  </span><span>trap</span><span> </span><span>"command rm -f </span><span>$helper</span><span>"</span><span> </span>EXIT<span> </span>INT
<span>  </span>&gt;<span> </span><span>$helper</span><span> </span><span>&lt;&lt;EOF</span>
<span>#!$SHELL</span>
<span>pass show $passname | head -1</span>
<span>EOF</span>
<span>  </span>chmod<span> </span>u+x<span> </span><span>$helper</span>
<span>  </span><span>SSH_ASKPASS</span><span>=</span><span>$helper</span><span> </span><span>SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE</span><span>=</span>force<span> </span><span>command</span><span> </span>ssh<span> </span><span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If the password is incorrect, we can display a prompt on the second
tentative:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>ssh<span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>set</span><span> </span>-o<span> </span>localoptions<span> </span>-o<span> </span>localtraps

<span>  </span><span>local</span><span> </span><span>helper</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>mktemp<span>)</span>
<span>  </span><span>trap</span><span> </span><span>"command rm -f </span><span>$helper</span><span>"</span><span> </span>EXIT<span> </span>INT
<span>  </span>&gt;<span> </span><span>$helper</span><span> </span><span>&lt;&lt;EOF</span>
<span>#!$SHELL</span>
<span>if [ -k $helper ]; then</span>
<span>  {</span>
<span>    oldtty=\$(stty -g)</span>
<span>    trap 'stty \$oldtty &lt; /dev/tty 2&gt; /dev/null' EXIT INT TERM HUP</span>
<span>    stty -echo</span>
<span>    print "\rpassword: "</span>
<span>    read password</span>
<span>    printf "\n"</span>
<span>  } &gt; /dev/tty &lt; /dev/tty</span>
<span>  printf "%s" "\$password"</span>
<span>else</span>
<span>  pass show $passname | head -1</span>
<span>  chmod +t $helper</span>
<span>fi</span>
<span>EOF</span>
<span>  </span>chmod<span> </span>u+x<span> </span><span>$helper</span>
<span>  </span><span>SSH_ASKPASS</span><span>=</span><span>$helper</span><span> </span><span>SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE</span><span>=</span>force<span> </span><span>command</span><span> </span>ssh<span> </span><span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A possible improvement is to use a different password entry depending on the
remote host:<sup id="fnref-zsh"><a href="#fn-zsh">3</a></sup></p>
<div><pre><span></span>ssh<span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>

<span>    </span>backup@*.example.net<span>)</span><span> </span><span>passname</span><span>=</span>company1/ssh/backup<span> </span><span>;;</span>
<span>  </span><span>esac</span>

<span>  </span><span># No password name? Just use regular SSH</span>
<span>  </span><span>[[</span><span> </span>-z<span> </span><span>$passname</span><span> </span><span>]]</span><span> </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> </span><span>{</span>

<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>$?</span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span>

<span>  </span><span># Invoke SSH with the helper for SSH_ASKPASS</span>
<span>  </span><span># […]</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It is also possible to make <code>scp</code> invoke our custom <code>ssh</code> function:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>scp<span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>set</span><span> </span>-o<span> </span>localoptions<span> </span>-o<span> </span>localtraps
<span>  </span><span>local</span><span> </span><span>helper</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>mktemp<span>)</span>
<span>  </span><span>trap</span><span> </span><span>"command rm -f </span><span>$helper</span><span>"</span><span> </span>EXIT<span> </span>INT
<span>  </span>&gt;<span> </span><span>$helper</span><span> </span><span>&lt;&lt;EOF </span>
<span>#!$SHELL</span>
<span>source ${(%):-%x}</span>
<span>ssh "\$@"</span>
<span>EOF</span>
<span>  </span><span>command</span><span> </span>scp<span> </span>-S<span> </span><span>$helper</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>For the complete code, have a look at my <a href="https://github.com/vincentbernat/zshrc/blob/master/rc/ssh.zsh">zshrc</a>. As an alternative, you can
put the <code>ssh()</code> function body into its own script file and replace <code>command ssh</code>
with <code>/usr/bin/ssh</code> to avoid an unwanted recursive call. In this case, the
<code>scp()</code> function is not needed anymore.</p>

<p>First, some vendors make it <a href="https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2020-syncing-ssh-keys-iosxr-ansible" title="Syncing SSH keys on Cisco IOS-XR with a custom Ansible module">difficult to associate an SSH key with a
user</a>. Then, many vendors do not support certificate-based
authentication, making it difficult to scale. Finally, interactions between
public-key authentication and finer-grained authorization methods like
TACACS+ and Radius are still uncharted territory.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref-why" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩︎</a></p>
