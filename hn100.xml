<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p><span size="1"><i>[This is a slightly edited repost of an essay from my old LiveJournal]</i></span></p>
<p>A friend recently complained about how many people lack the basic skill of believing arguments. That is, if you have a valid argument for something, then you should accept the conclusion. Even if the conclusion is unpopular, or inconvenient, or you don’t like it. He envisioned an art of rationality that would make people believe something <i>after it had been proven to them</i>.</p>
<p>And I nodded my head, because it sounded reasonable enough, and it wasn’t until a few hours later that I thought about it again and went “Wait, no, that would be a terrible idea.”</p>
<p>I don’t think I’m overselling myself too much to expect that I could argue circles around the average uneducated person. Like I mean that on most topics, I could demolish their position and make them look like an idiot. Reduce them to some form of “Look, everything you say fits together and I can’t explain why you’re wrong, I just know you are!” Or, more plausibly, “Shut up I don’t want to talk about this!”</p>
<p>And there are people who can argue circles around me. Maybe not on <i>every</i> topic, but on topics where they are experts and have spent their whole lives honing their arguments. When I was young I used to read pseudohistory books; Immanuel Velikovsky’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_in_Chaos">Ages in Chaos</a> is a good example of the best this genre has to offer. I read it and it seemed so obviously correct, so perfect, that I could barely bring myself to bother to search out rebuttals.</p>
<p>And then I read the rebuttals, and they were so obviously correct, so devastating, that I couldn’t believe I had ever been so dumb as to believe Velikovsky.</p>
<p>And then I read the rebuttals to the rebuttals, and they were so obviously correct that I felt silly for ever doubting.</p>
<p>And so on for several more iterations, until the labyrinth of doubt seemed inescapable. What finally broke me out wasn’t so much the lucidity of the consensus view so much as starting to sample different crackpots. Some were almost as bright and rhetorically gifted as Velikovsky, all presented insurmountable evidence for their theories, and all had mutually exclusive ideas. After all, Noah’s Flood couldn’t have been a cultural memory both of the fall of Atlantis <i>and</i> of a change in the Earth’s orbit, let alone of a lost Ice Age civilization or of megatsunamis from a meteor strike. So given that at least some of those arguments are wrong and all seemed practically proven, I am obviously just gullible in the field of ancient history. Given a total lack of independent intellectual steering power and no desire to spend thirty years building an independent knowledge base of Near Eastern history, I choose to just accept the ideas of the prestigious people with professorships in Archaeology, rather than those of the universally reviled crackpots who write books about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worlds_in_Collision">Venus being a comet</a>.</p>
<p>You could consider this a form of epistemic learned helplessness, where I know any attempt to evaluate the arguments is just going to be a bad idea so I don’t even try. If you have a good argument that the Early Bronze Age worked completely differently from the way mainstream historians believe, I just don’t want to hear about it. If you insist on telling me anyway, I will nod, say that your argument makes complete sense, and then totally refuse to change my mind or admit even the slightest possibility that you might be right.</p>
<p>(This is the correct Bayesian action: if I know that a false argument sounds just as convincing as a true argument, argument convincingness provides no evidence either way. I should ignore it and stick with my prior.)</p>
<p>I consider myself lucky in that my epistemic learned helplessness is circumscribed; there are still cases where I’ll trust the evidence of my own reason. In fact, I trust it in most cases other than infamously deceptive arguments in fields I know little about. But I think the average uneducated person doesn’t and shouldn’t. Anyone anywhere – politicians, scammy businessmen, smooth-talking romantic partners – would be able to argue them into anything. And so they take the obvious and correct defensive maneuver – they will never let anyone convince them of any belief that sounds “weird”.</p>
<p>(and remember that, if you grow up in the right circles, beliefs along the lines of “astrology doesn’t work” sound “weird”.)</p>
<p>This is starting to resemble ideas like compartmentalization and <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/2l6/taking_ideas_seriously/">taking ideas seriously</a>. The only difference between their presentation and mine is that I’m saying that for 99% of people, 99% of the time, taking ideas seriously is the wrong strategy. Or, at the very least, it should be the last skill you learn, after you’ve learned every other skill that allows you to know which ideas are or are not correct.</p>
<p>The people I know who are best at taking ideas seriously are those who are smartest and most rational. I think people are working off a model where these co-occur because you need to be very clever to resist your natural and detrimental tendency not to take ideas seriously. But I think they might instead co-occur because you have to be really smart in order for taking ideas seriously not to be immediately disastrous. You have to be really smart not to have been talked into enough terrible arguments to develop epistemic learned helplessness.</p>
<p>Even the smartest people I know have a commendable tendency not to take certain ideas seriously. Bostrom’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_argument#Origins">simulation argument</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_argument">anthropic doomsday argument</a>, <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Pascal%27s_mugging">Pascal’s Mugging</a> – I’ve never heard anyone give a coherent argument against any of these, but I’ve also never met anyone who fully accepts them and lives life according to their implications.</p>
<p>A friend tells me of a guy who once accepted fundamentalist religion because of Pascal’s Wager. I will provisionally admit that this person “takes ideas seriously”. Everyone else gets partial credit, at best.</p>
<p>Which isn’t to say that some people don’t do better than others. Terrorists seem pretty good in this respect. People used to talk about how terrorists must be very poor and uneducated to fall for militant Islam, and then someone did a study and found that they were disproportionately well-off, college educated people (many were engineers). I’ve heard a few good arguments in this direction before, things like how engineering trains you to have a very black-and-white right-or-wrong view of the world based on a few simple formulae, and this meshes with fundamentalism better than it meshes with subtle liberal religious messages.</p>
<p>But to these I’d add that a sufficiently smart engineer has never been burned by arguments above his skill level before, has never had any reason to develop epistemic learned helplessness. If Osama comes up to him with a really good argument for terrorism, he thinks “Oh, there’s a good argument for terrorism. I guess I should become a terrorist,” as opposed to “Arguments? You can prove anything with arguments. I’ll just stay right here and not blow myself up.”</p>
<p>Responsible doctors are at the other end of the spectrum from terrorists here. I once heard someone rail against how doctors totally ignored all the latest and most exciting medical studies. The same person, practically in the same breath, then railed against how <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">50% to 90% of medical studies are wrong</a>. These two observations are not unrelated. Not only are there so many terrible studies, but pseudomedicine (not the stupid homeopathy type, but <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/23/should-psychiatry-test-for-lead-more/">the type that</a> links everything to some obscure chemical on an out-of-the-way metabolic pathway) has, for me, proven much like pseudohistory – unless I am an expert in that particular subsubfield of medicine, it can sound very convincing even when it’s very wrong.</p>
<p>The medical establishment offers a shiny tempting solution. First, a total unwillingness to trust anything, no matter how plausible it sounds, until it’s gone through an endless cycle of studies and meta-analyses. Second, a bunch of Institutes and Collaborations dedicated to filtering through all these studies and analyses and telling you what lessons you should draw from them.</p>
<p>I’m glad that some people never develop epistemic learned helplessness, or develop only a limited amount of it, or only in certain domains. It seems to me that although these people are more likely to become terrorists or Velikovskians or homeopaths, they’re also the only people who can figure out if something basic and unquestionable is wrong, and make this possibility well-known enough that normal people start becoming willing to consider it.</p>
<p>But I’m also glad epistemic learned helplessness exists. It seems like a pretty useful social safety valve most of the time.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

      

      <p>I love this quote from Ray Bradbury about Edgar Rice Borroughs, the author of Tarzan and John Carter stories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Edgar Rice Burroughs never would have looked upon himself as a social mover and shaker with social obligations. But as it turns out – and I love to say it because it upsets everyone terribly – <span>Burroughs is probably the most influential writer in the entire history of the world.</span> By giving romance and adventure to a whole generation of boys, Burroughs caused them to go out and decide to become special.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The boys who read Borroughs’ <em>A Princess of Mars</em> would grow up to be NASA engineers. Or, at the very least, they'd grow up to be in support of real-world exploration and science. It’s not that Borroughs’ books were particularly scientific. Far from it. But they <em>were</em> exciting and inspiring.</p>
<p><img src="https://filiph.net/text/imgs/borroughs-crater-on-mars.jpg"></p><!--Carl Sagan, the astronomer, said: "Science fiction has led me to science."-->
<p>I don’t think that the past few generations have anything that quite reaches the influence of these stories. I grew up in the 1990’s, and while I romanticized space flight and advanced science as much as anyone else, my eyes went the widest from video games. Watching Star Trek, or a documentary about an oceanographer was cool, but you know what was cooler? Running around in a virtual environment where I could be a bad ass gun slinger or space marine or whatever, and have my own adventures, on my own terms.</p>
<p>Being able to immerse myself into a world that <em>exists to entertain me</em> was — surprise surprise! — preferable to doing almost anything else.</p>
<p>I don’t think we talk about this aspect of our era enough. And I believe lots of us have an emotional desire to minimize the negative impact of immersive videogames because <em>it’s our childhood.</em> But in this article, I'd like to posit that having such a different driving force nudges the progress of the whole human race in a direction that we wouldn’t have necessarily chosen if we were to make a rational choice.</p>
<h2 id="allocating-talent-to-the-wrong-problems">Allocating talent to the wrong problems</h2>
<p>Here’s another quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of the most talented artists of our time don’t do any art — they work in advertising.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Unfortunately, I can’t find who said it, which means I’m probably remembering the wording wrong. Consider it a paraphrase.)</p>
<p>Now, I’m not going to delve too deep into the particular topic of art and advertising. I do think there’s truth to it, and that maybe some of these people who are currently gainfully employed making ad jingles could be doing something ultimately more important for society — but I mention this quote here for another reason. It’s an example of outside forces nudging people to work on something that is not really that important in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>Here’s my variant of the quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of the most talented engineers of our time don’t do anything important — instead, they work on making our entertainment more immersive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They work on better 3D renderers, more appealing shaders, faster VR hardware, better spatial sound, more powerful game engines, more immersive games, more colorful phone screens, more eye-catching app animations, etc.</p>
<p>Here’s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>They grew up playing immersive 3D video games, and romanticizing that whole industry.</li>
<li>It pays.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t care how much you’re invested in the VR ecosystem or whatever — I hope you’ll agree that humanity has a variety of important engineering problems to solve, and <em>nicer-looking graphics is quite low on that list.</em> I know there are real-world use cases for better, more immersive rendering or bigger phone screens — but their utility pales in comparison to actual real-world research of actual real-world phenomena, does it not?</p>
<p><img src="https://filiph.net/text/imgs/are-virtual-reality-games-safe-for-kids.jpg"></p><p>The gaming industry has hijacked human play. Instead of an evolutionary learning and relaxation tool, it’s so immersive now that people get sucked into spending hundreds of hours playing games that don’t teach them anything valuable about the real world, and don’t relax them at all. I’m a gamer, and I of course <em>enjoy</em> immersing myself in a good AAA video game, but I had to admit to myself at one point that, long-term, playing video games for any extended period makes me physically miserable and dumber.</p>
<h2 id="going-less-immersive">Going less immersive</h2>
<p>I realize this probably reads as a rant. Please don’t take this as an attack. Instead, I would like for this article to be <em>inspiring</em>. There are so many amazing engineering problems out there. Many of them are more important than what you’re probably working on right now, and yet there are fewer people focusing on them, so there’s less competition, and more opportunity to actually “change the world.”</p>
<p>Focusing on such problems probably pays less, but if you’re reading this, chances are you’re not a starving artist. You’re in the tech industry. Even taking a major hit to your salary will still land you way above average. You’ll live. Take it from a guy who left a nice engineering position at Google in Silicon Valley to work as a solo developer in the Czech Republic.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4PUIxEWmsvI?si=KGU4UoHatuA8CQhM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>Maybe you’re like me, and you've already invested much of your career into graphics and UI programming. Maybe you (like me!) just can’t let go of your childhood dream to make videogame-like experiences. Well, there are still options. You can make apps and videogames that don’t immerse. My first (and quite successful!) “videogame” <a href="https://egamebook.com/knights/">looks like the Kindle app</a>. My second one <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2538440/GIANT_ROBOT_GAME/">looks like a CAD program</a>. There are new opportunities in things like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23954584/e-ink-color-tablets-ereader">e-Ink</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24029590/lg-oled-t-transparent-tv-announced-specs-features">transparent screens</a> or <a href="https://techbullion.com/what-to-expect-in-2024-a-deep-dive-into-the-internet-of-things/">IoT</a> that can help people re-focus on the real world around them yet still reap the benefits of technology.</p>
<p>My point is that you have a choice. You can still, of course, choose to push on making our technology as immersive as possible. If you develop your career on autopilot, you will probably end up doing that. But you don’t have to, and maybe you shouldn’t.</p>

<p>Command line interface (CLI) tools have a reputation for being difficult
to use.</p>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/1168"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tar.png" alt="XKCD 1168: tar"></a></p>
<p>Whilst powerful once mastered, a CLI inherently lacks a litany of user
interface “nice-to-haves”, simply by virtue of its medium:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Common tasks should be easy to perform. This is often
not the case, but worse is when tasks can be tweaked in myriad ways,
leading to a combinatorial explosion of flags, options and modifiers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Memorability:</strong> How does one remember all those different options?
It’s not realistic, which is why we so often resort to double-checking
the usage text, <code>man</code> pages, or search engine/generative AI du jour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discoverability:</strong> Reminding ourselves how to perform what we know
(or assume) can be done isn’t the same as guiding us towards the full
gamut of what’s possible. Even when reading the entire reference
manual (or source code), this isn’t a sure thing: useful emergent
behaviour often goes undocumented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Familiarity:</strong> So we effectively resort to guessing. <code>--help</code> <em>must</em>
give us the usage text, right? There are common idioms that are
pervasive, but even this is not a guarantee.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Open, meaningful communication is generally a good idea
in all walks of life. How often have you run a CLI command to be
presented with zero output, relying on <code>echo $?</code> to see if it even
succeeded? Or, at the other extreme, so much logging noise flooding
your terminal that you can’t tell what’s going on?</li>
</ul>
<p><code>tar</code>, lampooned in the above XKCD, is — at nearly 45-years-old — a
product of its age. The current GNU (and, to a lesser extent, BSD) <code>tar</code>
implementations go some way to improve things, but old habits die hard
and it’s still very common to see <code>tar chzPf</code>-and-friends in the wild.
Regardless, more modern tools also suffer from similar problems; anyone
who has used Git, or <em>shudder</em> GnuPG will attest to this.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://topiary.tweag.io/">Topiary</a> — Tweag’s code formatting engine — matures, I took the
opportunity to modernise its CLI before suboptimal patterns become
entrenched.</p>
<h2 id="sowing-the-seeds-of-change"><a href="#sowing-the-seeds-of-change" aria-label="sowing the seeds of change permalink"></a>Sowing the seeds of change</h2>
<p>In its early development, Topiary’s CLI was largely motivated by need.
When features were added, they were often exposed as command line
arguments, with little thought about the overall experience.</p>
<p>This is what it had organically grown into:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>CLI app for Topiary, the universal code formatter.

Usage: topiary [OPTIONS] &lt;--language &lt;LANGUAGE&gt;|--input-files [&lt;INPUT_FILES&gt;...]&gt;

Options:
  -l, --language &lt;LANGUAGE&gt;
          Which language to parse and format [possible values: json,
          nickel, ocaml, ocaml-interface, ocamllex, toml]
  -f, --input-files [&lt;INPUT_FILES&gt;...]
          Path to an input file or multiple input files. If omitted, or
          equal to "-", read from standard input. If multiple files are
          provided, `in_place` is assumed [default: -]
  -q, --query &lt;QUERY&gt;
          Which query file to use
  -o, --output-file &lt;OUTPUT_FILE&gt;
          Path to an output file. If omitted, or equal to "-", write to
          standard output
  -i, --in-place
          Format the input files in place
  -v, --visualise[=&lt;OUTPUT_FORMAT&gt;]
          Visualise the syntax tree, rather than format [possible
          values: json, dot]
  -s, --skip-idempotence
          Do not check that formatting twice gives the same output
      --output-configuration
          Output the full configuration to stderr before continuing
  -t, --tolerate-parsing-errors
          Format as much as possible even if some of the input causes
          parsing errors
      --configuration-override &lt;CONFIGURATION_OVERRIDE&gt;
          Override all configuration with the provided file [env:
          TOPIARY_CONFIGURATION_OVERRIDE=]
  -c, --configuration-file &lt;CONFIGURATION_FILE&gt;
          Add the specified configuration file with the highest priority
          [env: TOPIARY_CONFIGURATION_FILE=]
  -h, --help
          Print help
  -V, --version
          Print version</code></pre></div>
<p>Syntax tree visualisation is a good example: This was toggled with the
<code>--visualise</code> argument, which took an optional parameter to switch the
output format between GraphViz DOT and JSON. Visualisation was designed
as a different mode of operation, to aid the development of formatting
queries, but being expressed as an argument could imply to users that
formatting should still happen. This implication is reinforced by the
presence of formatting-specific arguments, such as <code>--skip-idempotence</code>
and <code>--tolerate-parsing-errors</code>; run together with <code>--visualise</code> is
meaningless, but it worked regardless.</p>
<p>At a more fundamental level, there’s the question of I/O: From where is
input read, and to where is it written? The input to a formatting tool
is kind of important, to say the least, and if Topiary is to do anything
besides cooking silicon wafers, it’s probably a good idea to do
something with its result. Yet an awkward dance of <code>--input-file</code>,
<code>--output-file</code> and <code>--in-place</code> was imposed. Those <em>may</em> seem
self-explanatory — and they were, in the beginning — but things
change:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When support for formatting multiple inputs was added, <code>--input-file</code>
became <code>--input-files</code>. However, what happens if I try to visualise
multiple inputs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do multiple inputs map to outputs? The usage text says that
<code>--in-place</code> is assumed in this case, but what if I also specify an
<code>--output-file</code>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What if I want to work with standard input or standard output? What
about read-only files? Is <code>--in-place</code> permitted in these cases?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do I even have to specify <code>--input-files</code> (or its short form,
<code>-f</code>)? Of course I’m going to be providing an input of some kind, so
it’s a bit redundant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While some of these questions were answered by the usage text, to really
know the behaviour of edge cases, you’d have to experiment or start
reading the source code.</p>
<p>Then there are the little things. Like when providing custom
configuration, how do <code>--configuration-file</code> and
<code>--configuration-override</code> interact? (I actually did have to read the
source code to figure that one out!) What about logging output,
presuming there is any; how does one access that?</p>
<p>Death by a thousand cuts.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong: Topiary’s CLI was certainly functional in this
state. However, it leant too heavily on assumptions and the Topiary
team’s collective (but inscrutable) knowledge. This made it clumsy,
sometimes surprising and, overall, imposed too much friction on new
users.</p>
<h2 id="mighty-oaks-from-little-acorns-grow"><a href="#mighty-oaks-from-little-acorns-grow" aria-label="mighty oaks from little acorns grow permalink"></a>Mighty oaks from little acorns grow</h2>
<p>So I decided to fully rework the CLI. My mandate was clear:</p>
<h3 id="make-illegal-states-unrepresentable"><a href="#make-illegal-states-unrepresentable" aria-label="make illegal states unrepresentable permalink"></a>Make illegal states unrepresentable</h3>
<p>This is a classic idiom from strongly typed functional programming,
where the type system is leveraged to forbid invalid input. The same
logic applies to command line arguments and, as Topiary is written in
Rust, I was able to achieve this using the same mechanism.</p>
<p>Topiary uses the excellent <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap">clap</a> command line argument parser library,
which has a feature to derive the parser directly from your types and
their annotations (such as doc comments). This makes the definition of
the CLI arguments purely declarative, leaving you with only the work of
setting up your types correctly. All my other CLI modernisation work
stems from here.</p>
<p>To give some examples of what’s now unrepresentable (i.e., will fail):</p>
<ul>
<li>Attempting to visualise multiple files;</li>
<li>Specifying a formatting language when formatting files (which instead
use inference on the filename, driven by the configuration) or, vice

</ul>
<h3 id="separate-modes-of-operation"><a href="#separate-modes-of-operation" aria-label="separate modes of operation permalink"></a>Separate modes of operation</h3>
<p>Formatting and visualisation are two distinct modes of operation; they
do different things and take different options. Visualisation with
<code>--in-place</code> wouldn’t only be wrong, it would be catastrophic! The
former CLI also had an additional “pseudo-mode” of outputting the raw
configuration to standard error, for debugging purposes.</p>
<p>The old-fashioned way of separating modes in non-interactive CLI tools
was to have multiple binaries. This tends to both pollute the global
command namespace (ImageMagick’s <code>convert</code>, anyone?) and can be hindered
by a lack of consistency amongst related tools.</p>
<p>The new hotness — and by “new”, I mean “for the last decade, or two”
— is to use subcommands to mark this separation. So that’s what I did:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>topiary format</code> formats your code.</li>
<li><code>topiary visualise</code> visualises your code.</li>
<li><code>topiary config</code> outputs the computed configuration, as TOML.
(Formatted, of course!)</li>
<li><code>topiary completion</code> is a new feature, which generates shell
completion scripts to aid discoverability.</li>
</ul>
<p>All have common options and each have specific options, facilitated by
the types I defined. If a new mode is developed in the future, it can
just be added without breaking backwards compatibility.</p>
<h3 id="make-use-of-familiar-idioms"><a href="#make-use-of-familiar-idioms" aria-label="make use of familiar idioms permalink"></a>Make use of familiar idioms</h3>
<p>Interaction with a CLI tool, that misses out on the visual cues and
metaphors that a GUI can provide, should be like a dialogue. (Preferably
a productive and friendly one, rather than one that ends up with you
questioning your life choices.) To that end, a de facto lexicon exists
amongst CLI tools with common behaviours that should be adhered to. It
would be weird, for example, if <code>--assist</code> was the option to show the
usage text, rather than <code>--help</code>.</p>
<p>There are a few things I’ve done in the new Topiary CLI to improve its
conversation skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While <code>--input-file</code> and the likes are not unheard of, it’s far more
common, when input is required, to use positional <code>FILE</code> arguments.
This also plays nicely with, say, scripts that one may wish to write.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The point of a formatter is to format its input, it therefore stands
to reason that <code>--in-place</code> is implied when dealing with files. (A
notable exception to this is <code>sed</code>, but as a “stream editor” first,
it has a little more right to an <code>--in-place</code> option, which is not
its default.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to format standard input is still important, though. In
which case, rather than using the <code>-</code> file convention, files are
simply omitted. This allows Topiary to be put into a script pipeline
and enables this common interaction:</p>
<div data-language="console"><pre><code>$ topiary format --language json   ⟵ Invocation
{"type":"your code here"}          ⟵ Standard input
&lt;Ctrl+D&gt;                           ⟵ EOF
{ "type": "your code here" }       ⟵ Formatted standard output</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logging information has always existed in Topiary, but you wouldn’t
know unless you read the <code>README</code> fairly thoroughly. It used to be
exposed through the <code>RUST_LOG</code> environment variable, which is an
artefact of the <code>env_logger</code> library. This has been changed to a
<code>--verbose</code> flag, following the common idiom of “more occurrences
means more output” (e.g., <code>-vvv</code> maps to <code>debug</code> logging).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="make-common-tasks-easy-and-unsurprising"><a href="#make-common-tasks-easy-and-unsurprising" aria-label="make common tasks easy and unsurprising permalink"></a>Make common tasks easy and unsurprising</h3>
<p>Topiary exposes a number of options. These knobs allow you to change its
behaviour in various ways and, while they shouldn’t be hidden away, they
shouldn’t obstruct the “happy path”. This echoes the design principles
that were laid out for Topiary’s formatting styles: uniform and “good
enough”. The same can be said for the CLI: Simplicity, over steampunk.</p>
<p>Some examples I’ve implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Formatting all your project’s files is just a matter of running
<code>topiary format PROJECT_DIR</code>. Topiary will recursively walk the
directory (no longer having to rely on shell expansion) and format
every file it understands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visualisation defaults to GraphViz DOT output, rather than JSON. A PDF
of the syntax tree can now be created with the very natural:</p>
<div data-language="sh"><pre><code>topiary visualise /path/to/my.file <span>\</span>
<span>|</span> dot <span>-Tpdf</span> <span>\</span>
<span>&gt;</span> syntax-tree.pdf</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Topiary’s configuration is sourced from a priority list and then
collated in one of three ways. This affords a high degree of
customisation, but can make it difficult to introspect the runtime
configuration. However, <code>topiary config</code> will not only output the
computed configuration — which can then be reused, for
reproducibility’s sake — but Topiary will also annotate it in a way
that lets you understand where it came from:</p>
<div data-language="toml"><pre><code><span># Configuration collated from the following sources,</span>
<span># in priority order (lowest to highest):</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># 1. Built-in configuration</span>
<span># 2. /home/user/.config/topiary/languages.toml</span>
<span># 3. /home/user/my-project/.topiary/languages.toml</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># Collation mode: Merge</span>

<span>[</span><span>[</span><span>language</span><span>]</span><span>]</span>
<span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"json"</span>
<span>extensions</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>"json"</span><span>,</span>
<span>]</span>

<span># etc.</span></code></pre></div>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dont-paint-yourself-into-a-corner"><a href="#dont-paint-yourself-into-a-corner" aria-label="dont paint yourself into a corner permalink"></a>Don’t paint yourself into a corner</h3>
<p>You may be thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Topiary is primarily a formatter, why can’t I just skip the
<code>format</code> subcommand and have the CLI assume that as the default?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a good question and one which I asked myself. The most common task
for the Topiary CLI will be formatting, so by my earlier admission of
“making common tasks easy”, surely this optimisation would be
beneficial?</p>
<p>The answer to this has two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><del>Firstly, clap doesn’t make this easy to do, when using its
derivation feature. Subcommands can certainly be optional, but to
force the parser into a “default path or subcommand path” state
machine, while maintaining coherent usage text, significantly goes
against its grain.</del></p>
<p>Shortly after publishing this article, Ed Page — the principal
contributor of clap — reached out to let me know that clap can
actually do this, and quite straightforwardly. As to my second point,
below, while generally true, he also suggested an interesting
<a href="https://github.com/tweag/topiary/issues/641">compromise</a>, which the Topiary team will work on
implementing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More importantly, however, is that if Topiary commits to providing a
stable interface — which it certainly does — then other subcommands
(current and future) are effectively blocked by virtue of the
positional and arbitrary file inputs. What happens, for example, if
you want to format a file called <code>config</code>?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This second point is crucial. Not only does it have the effect of
prohibiting legitimate subcommands, but users will come to rely on this
shorthand which fossilises the interface with suboptimal behaviour.</p>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/1172"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/workflow.png" alt="XKCD 1172: Workflow"></a></p>
<p>For the same reason, I don’t allow subcommand or long option inference
(that is, expanding partial CLI arguments when there are no
ambiguities). There are, however, a handful of subcommand aliases which
are helpful to make common tasks quicker to type (e.g., <code>fmt</code> for
<code>format</code>), or when alternative spellings are common.</p>
<h2 id="see-the-forest-for-the-trees"><a href="#see-the-forest-for-the-trees" aria-label="see the forest for the trees permalink"></a>See the forest for the trees</h2>
<p>The full usage text for what I ended up with is too long to paste into
this article, but it can of course be <a href="https://github.com/tweag/topiary#usage">found in Topiary’s
documentation</a>. Besides, maybe a little demo would be
more illustrative. Here’s how it looks with completion in <code>zsh</code> (i.e.,
don’t blame Topiary for the clipping):</p>

<p>The path trod to arrive at this destination was not random. It was
informed by my own experience with CLI tools, guided by the direction
in which clap steers you. Further polish was added on the advice of the
<a href="https://clig.dev/">Command Line Interface Guidelines</a> book. That said, UX research
is a legitimate discipline — involving testing and analytics on, you
know, <em>users</em> — which is usually the purview of GUIs. I’m not aware of
any UX research done in the realm of CLIs, but this may be an
interesting lead to follow.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the changes discussed in this article, as well as
numerous “quality of life” improvements to the CLI codebase — and other
enhancements to Topiary, as a whole — landed in <a href="https://github.com/tweag/topiary/releases/v0.3.0">Topiary
v0.3</a>. Making such sweeping changes was a big job that
required careful planning and review. However, I think the results speak
for themselves and that this upfront investment will pay off as Topiary
blooms.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>My name is Drew, I’m the founder of SourceHut and one of three SourceHut staff
members working on the outage, alongside my colleagues Simon and Conrad. As you
have noticed, SourceHut is down. I offer my deepest apologies for this
situation. We have made a name for ourselves for reliability, and this is the
most severe and prolonged outage we have ever faced. We spend a lot of time
planning to make sure this does not happen, and we failed. We have all hands on
deck working the problem to restore service as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In our emergency planning models, we have procedures in place for many kinds of
eventualities. What has happened this week is essentially our worst-case
scenario: “what if the primary datacenter just disappeared tomorrow?” We ask
this question of ourselves seriously, and make serious plans for what we’d do if
this were to pass, and we are executing those plans now – though we had hoped
that we would never have to.</p>
<p>I humbly ask for your patience and support as we deal with a very difficult
situation, and, again, I offer my deepest apologies that this situation has come
to pass.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-happening">What is happening?</h2>
<p>At 06:30 UTC on January 10th, two days prior to the time of writing, a
distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) began targetting SourceHut. We still
do not know many details – we don’t know who they are or why they are
targetting us, but we do know that they are targetting SourceHut specifically.</p>
<p>We deal with ordinary DDoS attacks in the normal course of operations, and we
are generally able to mitigate them on our end. However, this is not an ordinary
DDoS attack; the attacker posesses considerable resources and is operating at a
scale beyond that which we have the means to mitigate ourselves. In response,
before we could do much ourselves to understand or mitigate the problem, our
upstream network provider null routed SourceHut entirely, rendering both the
internet at large, and SourceHut staff, unable to reach our servers.</p>
<p>The primary datacenter, PHL, was affected by this problem. We rent colocation
space from our PHL supplier, where we have our own servers installed. We
purchase networking through our provider, who allocates us a block out of their
AS, and who upstreams with Cogent, which is the upstream that ultimately black
holed us. Unfortunately, our colocation provider went through two acquisitions
in the past year, and we failed to notice that our account had been forgotten as
they migrated between ticketing systems through one of these acquisitions. Thus
unable to page them, we were initially forced to wait until their normal office
hours began to contact them, 7 hours after the start of the incident.</p>
<p>When we did get them on the phone, our access to support ticketing was restored,
they apologised profusely for the mistake, and we were able to work with them on
restoring service and addressing the problems we were facing. This led to
SourceHut’s availability being partially restored on the evening of January
10th, until the DDoS escalated in the early hours of January 11th, after which
point our provider was forced to null route us again.</p>
<p>We have seen some collateral damage as well. You may have noticed that Hacker
News was down on January 10th; we believe that was ultimately due to Cogent’s
heavy handed approach to mitigating the DDoS targetting SourceHut (sorry, HN,
glad you got it sorted). Last night, a non-profit free software forge, Codeberg,
also became subject to a DDoS, which is still ongoing and may be caused by the
same actors. This caused our status page to go offline – Codeberg has been kind
enough to host it for us so that it’s reachable during an outage – we’re not
sure if Codeberg was targetted because they hosted our status page or if this is
part of a broader attack on free software forge platforms.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-we-doing-about-it">What are we doing about it?</h2>
<p>We maintain three sites, PHL, FRE, and AMS. PHL is our primary and is offline,
FRE is our backup site, and AMS is a research installation we eventually hoped
to use to migrate our platform to European hosting. As we initially had no
access whatsoever to PHL, we began restoring from backups to AMS to set up a
parallel installation of SourceHut from scratch.</p>
<p>We have since received some assistance from our PHL provider in regaining access
to our PHL servers out of band, which is speeding up affairs, but we do not
expect to get PHL online soon and we are proceeding with the AMS installation
for now.</p>
<p>The prognosis on user data loss is good. Our backups are working and regularly
tested, the last full backup of git and hg was taken a few hours before the DDoS
began, and we have out-of-band access to the live PHL servers where all changes
which occured since the most recent backup are safely preserved. The database is
replicated in real-time and was only seconds behind production before it went
offline.</p>
<p>We have replicated the production database in AMS and started spinning up
SourceHut services there: we have meta, todo, lists, paste, and the project hub
fully operational against production data in our staging environment here. We
are still working on the following services in order of priority:</p>
<ol>
<li>git.sr.ht</li>
<li>hg.sr.ht</li>
<li>pages.sr.ht</li>
<li>chat.sr.ht</li>
<li>man.sr.ht</li>
<li>builds.sr.ht</li>
</ol>
<p>These services, particularly git and hg, require large transfers of data across
our networks to restore from backups, and will take some time. Chat does not
require particularly large amounts of data to be managed, but has special
networking concerns that we are addressing as well.</p>
<p>Our goal is to enable read-only access for the community as quickly as possible,
then work on full read/write access following that. Object storage (used for
git/hg releases, build artifacts, and SourceHut pages) presents a special set of
problems; we are working on those separately. Finding suitable compute to run
build jobs is another issue which requires special attention, but we have a plan
for this as well.</p>
<p>One of our main concerns right now is finding a way of getting back online on a
new network without the DDoS immediately following us there, and we have reason
to believe that it will. A layer 3 DDoS like the one we are facing is complex
and expensive to mitigate. We spoke to CloudFlare and were quoted a number we
cannot reasonably achieve within our financial means, but we are investigating
other solutions which may be more affordable and have a few avenues for research
today, though we cannot disclose too many details without risking alerting the
attackers to our plans.</p>
<h2 id="how-you-can-help">How you can help</h2>
<p>What we need the most right now is your patience and understanding. Mitigating
this sort of attack is a marathon, not a sprint, and we have to be careful not
to overwork our staff, ensure we’re getting enough sleep, and so on – we are
working as hard as we can. There are many people hard at work on this problem
for you – I’d like to thank Simon and Conrad in particular for their work, as
well as the datacenter and network operators upstream of us who are doing their
best as well.</p>
<p>You can receive updates on this page, so long as we’re able to keep it online
(low priority), as well as <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@drewdevault">on Mastodon</a>, where we are posting updates as
well. This is also a good place to share your words of support and
encouragement, as well as the #sr.ht IRC channel on Libera Chat. My inbox at
<a href="mailto:sir@cmpwn.com">sir@cmpwn.com</a> is also working (not without some effort,
I’ll add), if you wish to send your support or offer any resources that might
help.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and support. We are working to make things right
with you.</p>

</a>Why remove cookies?</h2>
<p>The thought of going completely cookieless seems daunting and borderline ludicrous to a lot of the marketers that I talk to. If you were to remove all cookies today, like we did at Sentry in July 2023, it would radically change the functionality of your martech stack. This is covered thoroughly in <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/digital-marketing-strategy/digital-advertising-trends-cookieless-advertising-is-coming-are-you-ready-for-it/">articles like this</a>, but in brief, things like attribution, remarketing, or Account Based Marketing (ABM) would be rendered much less effective and it would almost certainly lead to a material loss in revenue.</p>
<p>Not to mention If performance marketing is a key driver of revenue for your business, levers like targeting, bidding, reporting, and procurement become extremely challenging. However, with Google’s <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/cookie-countdown-2023oct/">promise to remove cookies for some users in Q1 2024</a> and completely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/27/google-delays-move-away-from-cookies-in-chrome-to-2024/">remove cookies from Chrome by the second half of 2024</a> looming, you basically have three approaches you can take:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ignore</strong> that this is happening and wait until you are forced to make changes around Q2/Q3 this year (not recommended).</li>
<li><strong>Become an early adopter</strong> as ad platforms continue to optimize and introduce newer solutions for cookie removal like Enhanced Conversions, GA4, Conversions API, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/221353413010930?id=547299432790676">Conversion Lift</a>, etc. so as to not cause any drastic shake ups until the platforms are ready for the shift.</li>
<li><strong>Completely remove cookies</strong> sooner rather than later, and start directing your time and energy towards future models that respect your users’ privacy.</li>
</ol>

<p>We chose the third route despite Google sending us an entire deck to tell us why we shouldn’t. We actually took it a step further by removing all user tracking, period. Was it worth it? In this post, I’ll share some early results and all of the pitfalls and triumphs that we’ve faced ever since removal of every advertising cookie and user tracking in June 2023. My hope is that this can give others a dos and don’ts list and best practices for the inevitable shift from cookies in 2024.</p>

</a>Why completely remove cookies and user tracking now when I can just wait?</h2>
<p>The way I see it, there are a handful of reasons a marketer might decide to gut their website of cookies and traditional user tracking in general:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cookie consent banners, App Tracking Transparency (ATT), and consent management platforms (CMPs) for GDPR/CCPA compliance have already obfuscated tracking data enough to make you question if the data you have is reliable.</li>
<li>Your audience is probably privacy-conscious. Aren’t we all learning to be as companies <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/tiktok-data-privacy">misuse</a> our data? Ultimately you want your brand to align with your audience’s desires and demands. And your audience will appreciate one less banner to dismiss when they just want to load your page.</li>
<li>Your time and effort could be better spent driving towards learning new cookieless tools and techniques and also building sugar-free (bad cookie joke) solutions for acquiring customers, understanding behaviors, reporting, and measurement.</li>
<li>This shift will happen later this year anyway and you’re likely already struggling with increasingly non-traceable user journeys, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_social_media">dark social</a> channels, etc. Being reactive will put you behind while other companies (see Apple) move forward and build moats of differentiation.</li>
</ul>
<p>At Sentry, the idea to strip all advertising cookies was born out of respecting our privacy conscious audience, and our own <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/privacy-by-default/">privacy by default values</a>. We market to developers who notoriously do not like being marketed to (we should know; we are a developer-led company and Sentry users ourselves), so the idea of removing ad cookies instantly intrigued us. And, if given the choice, why not build for tomorrow, today? That decision has had ancillary benefits along our journey that we’ll get into, one being that it gave us an excuse to do away with the annoying cookie consent banners which have come to define modern web browsing.</p>
<p>Sounds like good-enough reasoning, right? Despite the momentum internally to do this, to be honest, as a growth marketer I was excited at the prospect of it, but I started thinking about all of the things that are going to break. The initial response I had was to raise concerns for why we shouldn’t do it or to delay it. The following breakpoints stuck out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our attribution models (first and multi-touch in our case)</li>
<li>Our marketing reports in our business insights tool</li>
<li>Google Analytics</li>
<li>All of our SEO reporting (built on GA and GA4)</li>
<li>Google Ads smart bidding</li>
<li>Procurement of onboarding new tools</li>
<li>Remarketing</li>
</ul>
<p>…And there’s an admittedly large list of stuff we didn’t think through that caused problems when we removed ALL user tracking on our site:</p>
<ul>
<li>YouTube video embeds on our website used cookies</li>
<li>Our GCLID from Google Ads passing onto our site*</li>
<li>Our bot blocking tool for ads relying on both a pixel and GCLID</li>
<li>Lookalike modeling not being an option b/c of data sharing with ad platforms*</li>
<li>Not being able to use Salesforce x Google Ads integration*</li>
<li>4xing our website’s 404s and redirects on accident (whoops)</li>
<li>Completely losing signups from display marketing and YouTube</li>
<li>Losing referrer data for content analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>*Some of these were more due to extreme measures we took by removing user tracking, cookies, and the cookie banner as a whole, but most were due to the removal of cookies</p>
<p>We’ll cover some of these and share how to avoid the same mistakes we made in the next section.</p>
<p>To state the obvious, performance marketing is critical for many businesses; Gartner says digital spending accounted for <a href="https://www.webstrategiesinc.com/blog/how-much-budget-for-online-marketing">over half of marketing budgets</a> in 2022.  Given the importance of this channel and the challenges laid out above, how can you actually take on the risk of running performance monitoring without cookies?</p>
<p>I don’t have all of the answers for every industry and audience, but I’ll offer you insights from our first eight months going completely without cookies and user tracking.</p>

</a>Targeting Without Cookies</h3>
<p>The current state of targeting has already been severely impacted by various changes in the last few years. Remember the havoc Apple wreaked on the entire digital advertising ecosystem when they launched <a href="https://www.adjust.com/glossary/app-tracking-transparency/">ATT</a>? At the time, Facebook (now Meta) estimated a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2022/10/08/apples-12-billion-strike-to-facebook-is-suddenly-taking-shape/?sh=4e553fdb1636">loss in 10-13 billion ad revenue dollars</a> related to the change, likely a direct reflection of advertisers shifting budget away from Meta because they lost ROI. And that was just one in a string of privacy changes that likely impacted digital marketing performance.</p>
<p>If that wasn’t enough of a triggering thought, how much less of a remarketing pool did you have across ad platforms when people started opting out of the consent banner on your site, 30% reduction? 50%… or more? On top of that, you were already dealing with ad blockers, and probably depend heavily on walled gardens to give you targeting options that work for your specific audience.</p>
<p>When third-party cookies are fully deprecated this year, there will undoubtedly be more struggles for performance marketers. Without traditional pixels or conversion signals, Google (largest ad platform in the world) struggles to find intent of web visitors to purchase. Shifting now, this made our targeting on Google search much worse, but actually still tolerable because you can use keywords intent and negative search terms as a guiding light. However Youtube, Display, Shopping, <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/13859703?hl=en">Demand Gen</a>, or PMAX campaigns depend on these purchase intent signals paired with black box contextual audiences that Google gives you which, at times, in our case were scattershot at best. For example, one custom intent audience that utilized search terms/history was showing us billions of impressions (more than the current population of the world) in the estimated audience size, even though it utilized long tail search terms. Not exactly precise targeting to reach software developers in our case.</p>

</a>What happened to our targeting?</h3>
<p>Our Google rep, our ad agency, and I all knew that Google’s lack of signals would cut deep, so when we went cookieless, we treated it as an opportunity to learn how we would pivot to find our audience, rather than a doomsday event.</p>
<p>Display and other channels were severely hampered after cookie removal; our traditional retargeting motion died off pretty quickly as we couldn’t use GA4’s audiences or our Google Ads pixel. We had to pivot our strategy fast.</p>
<p>We decided to rely on ad engagement retargeting (rather than traditional retargeting) on most of our ad channels which isn’t the same, but still gives us a semblance of a funnel. We tailored our ads that are focused on middle of funnel (MOF) and bottom of funnel (BOF) to this engaged audience. This is a not-so-bad patch for a broken retargeting effort as long as you have engaging content and the budget to promote it. Engagement retargeting is offered on Meta, LinkedIn, Youtube, and Reddit, and we pair video ads at the top of the funnel to drive engagement.</p>
<p>At the same time we were figuring out remarketing, we also lost confidence in prospecting with Display and decided to migrate budget to sponsorships and publishers that we instinctively knew had our core audience. This may produce less flashy conversion counts depending on your business, but it gave us a place to tell our story to our audience. It also forced us to focus more on content marketing which speaks to the potential customer’s jobs to be done; it also builds trust and goodwill instead of trying to get vanity signups or [insert your BOF KPI] with a cold prospecting audience.</p>
<p>When deciding to remove cookies or user tracking in general, these are your top three targeting considerations IMO:</p>
<ol>
<li>How you’ll segment funnel stages in creative ways</li>
<li>Will you still have faith in your current channels to continue to reach your audience or do you need to explore other channels?</li>
<li>Which bidding model you will shift to and what potential impacts to targeting might you see</li>
<li>BONUS: How will you prepare the stakeholders in your company for the inevitable impact on traceable conversions? This could be its own post, so we’ll keep this one about the nuts and bolts, but you should start thinking about this now. Getting cross-functional buy-in (and crucially, that of leadership) is the best first step, so feel free to share this post with whomever needs to see it</li>

</a>Bidding</h3>
<p>Most ad platforms rely on pixels and cookies to train the bidding algorithm on which type of users convert for your business and which will hit specific KPIs or cost per actions (CPAs) that you’re going after.</p>
<p>In our case most of our ad platforms were set up with pixels that sent conversion signals to the ad platforms when a signup or a request for a demo happened on our website. We were also piping in conversions with offline uploading to get down-funnel events to train Google to find the right user intent. This can be done with Google, Meta conversions API (CAPI), and  LinkedIn (with <a href="https://bit.ly/offline-conversion-upload">offline conversion upload</a>.) For digital marketers this is a way to improve CPAs and level up from 101 digital marketing, but it also involves either cookieing or sending user information back to an ad platform. Quick nuance: for certain tracking technology like hashed offline passbacks—although it isn’t technically a cookie—it may still be subject to “cookie laws” and you may need to keep your screen-eating cookie banner. So in addition to cookies, we had to do away with GCLID passback for example, because we wanted to remove our cookie banner and because our users deserve their privacy. Be sure to discuss with your legal team how this might apply if you want to remove your banner.</p>
<p>For us, our bidding models had the largest impact on revenue; because Google is one of our largest ad platforms and is now no longer trained on clicks/intention to purchase, just that the user clicked. There was actually about a two to three week delay in performance declines after we went cookieless where Google still had data we used to train it on and our campaigns continued to perform well.</p>
<p>However when comparing period over period from before we removed user tracking and cookies on our site to after, <strong>we saw around a 30% increase in our cost per click (CPCs) in Google search</strong>. It varied between brand and non-brand searches, but this shows the impact of what you’re up against. Bottom line: your ad campaigns could get that much worse post-cookie removal if you don’t adopt hashed passbacks or offline signals/apis and if you’re utilizing smart strategies like Target CPA bidding, Maximize Conversions, etc.</p>
<p>Our options became pretty limited without these conversion signals fed into our ad platforms because of our hard line drawn at total cookie banner removal and 0 user tracking:</p>
<p><strong>For Google Search</strong>: we shifted back to Enhanced CPC and Max Clicks which optimizes for less important factors than our old model (definitely a downgrade). We stay on top of our negative keywords and regional data so much more now as a proxy for using a bidding model to sort through intent of users.</p>
<p><strong>For YouTube</strong>: We shifted to Target CPV for any video viewer or engagement and Target CPM for awareness. We had to remove video action campaigns here and so we focused more on reach. Instead of a drastic loss, we actually ended up 13xing our views on our videos period over period, and are getting more quality site visitors than we used to. We’re still getting conversions from this channel and our benchmarks for view rate are right at our industry average (and above the benchmark from Google) so this ended up being a successful shift. We also saw over 100% growth in folks mentioning they heard us from Youtube on our onboarding survey quarter over quarter. Shifting bidding strategies here could be worth trying, regardless of your decision with cookies.</p>
<p><strong>For Display</strong>: We shifted to viewable CPM. As a result, our CPM was nearly cut in half and we saw a surprisingly large increase in impressions (north of 20%) month over month after making this shift. However our conversions tailed off and then dropped off of a cliff with the shift in bidding models.</p>

<em>Note: we kept our bidding model on smart bidding for a while after the cookie change in hopes Google would utilize historical conversion data, it worked for a little but was a sharp decline”</em></p>
<p>These conversions weren’t converting through our funnel to paying customers at a high enough rate anyway (even with a long term view), so our shift in bidding strategy for display was paired with a shift to executing more brand and awareness marketing with display rather than direct response which wasn’t a great fit for the channel anyway.</p>
<p><strong>For most other channels</strong>: We removed pixels and rely on UTMs paired with manual bidding. More on this in the section below.</p>

</a>Cookieless Tracking/Attribution/Reporting</h2>
<p>Consider the challenges you probably already face with regards to reporting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most users on paid social channels are on mobile devices which introduces cross device tracking as well as view-through targeting challenges.</li>
<li>Ad blockers were already plaguing your ability to see a large portion of your audience. <a href="https://backlinko.com/ad-blockers-users">42.7%</a> of internet users worldwide use ad blockers.</li>
<li>Hidden user journey moments like a shared linkedin post or an executive hearing about you on a podcast or at an event are already influencing deals.</li>
<li>If you’re using an attribution model, it’s probably not accounting for the above touches and you are probably favoring certain channels too much given how complex a buyer journey is in today’s age.</li>
<li>Matching up spend to down-funnel events for ROI/ROAS calculations is a big undertaking. Drilling down to the keyword or audience to understand your distribution areas and where to spend your budget is time consuming.</li>
<li>Even if you have everything orchestrated and deduping out of one ad server like CM360, you’re still dealing with the cookie banner and ad blockers removing a chunk of your vision and signals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now take away cookies and user tracking and you’re left with…?</p>
<p>Reporting and attribution became a <strong>huge</strong> lift for us when we went cookieless. Our Business Insights (BI) team flagged that our attribution data was going to break and we needed to migrate to a new underlying table. On top of this, we had to switch attribution models from First and Multi-touch (depending on what we were measuring) to Last-click because we would only be able to track the previous page visited by a user before conversion without storing data on the user’s browser. We were lucky to have a competent BI team and alignment top-down to be able to pivot and get a new attribution model and new table of underlying data.</p>
<p>This took a TON of back and forth, basically building logic that an out-of-the-box attribution solution already has in SQL, but we finally got to a place where we could salvage around 50% of attribution data. This was a huge win for us, to directionally understand the best channels that lead to business outcomes. Because we lost so much data, we also instituted a self-reported attribution “how did you hear about us” survey. Eight months in, and we’ve actually found new channels and learned a lot about our old ones. Ironically, a lack of data actually led to new insights.</p>
<p>My advice here is to figure out where your attribution is done (CRM, Data Warehouse, 3rd party tool?) and if you’re serious about removing cookies, start discussing the lift it would take to move to a model that’s simpler.</p>
<p>After more than a half a year of cookieless attribution, my takeaway is that UTMs and referrer data, when done right, directionally do the trick for understanding which ads, publishers, campaigns, and audiences are performing. The self-reported attribution survey we prioritized now helps remove our bias and uncover new expansion areas. We’re also working on understanding blended data. All of these are excellent muscles to develop for a cookieless future.</p>

</a>Procurement</h2>
<p>Going cookieless doesn’t mean you shouldn’t actively be hunting for new solutions to help improve performance. In the Marketing Technology Landscape, published by <a href="https://chiefmartec.com/">chiefmartec.com</a> and its editor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sjbrinker/">Scott Brinker</a>, the amount of technology options for marketing grew from <a href="https://chiefmartec.com/2023/05/2023-marketing-technology-landscape-supergraphic-11038-solutions-searchable-on-martechmap-com/">150 in 2011 to 11,038 in 2023</a>. There are more options now than ever before, and much more innovation and disruption happening.</p>
<p>We’ve recently met with companies that do Attribution, Account Based Marketing, Demand Sided Platforms (DSPs), Connected TV, and Analytics tools, and every conversation sputters out as soon as we mention privacy and our lack of cookies. Our marketing team would leave demo calls with serious concerns that our new privacy policy would render the tool not worth the sticker price, even if we could use it in a limited fashion.</p>
<p>Despite this challenge, there are going to be more and more tools out there that can navigate user tracking and cookieless well. Here are a few questions that I’ve found to be useful to ask current vendors up for renewal, or prospective tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does your software comply with data protection and privacy regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA? If so, can we get access to any documentation that you have?
<ul>
<li>Data Processing Agreement</li>
<li>Terms of service</li>
<li>BONUS: While you’re here asking for docs, you may have a security/compliance team that will ask for these anyway:
<ul>
<li>ISO/SOC2 certifications</li>
<li>Prepopulated security questionnaire like the <a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/consensus-assessments-initiative-questionnaire-v3-1/">CAIQ</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does it require a tracking script to run?
<ul>
<li>If the script picks up analytics data, e.g., conversion data, then it could violate your cookie policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can you explain the different types of cookies your software utilizes and their specific functions?</li>
<li>How does your software collect and store data related to user interactions?</li>
<li>Does your software share user data with third parties, and if so, how is this handled?</li>
</ul>
<p>Often a tool will claim that they are cookieless and still do some form of user tracking. For example, we switched from GA4 to <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a> and needed to know the nuances of how they use IP addresses. Know that if you want to remove your cookie banner, even if a tool is “cookieless”, you still may not be able to use it because cookie laws can apply broadly to tracking technology. Make sure to get on the same page about this with your legal team early on, before you make any procurement decisions.</p>

</a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Going cookieless might seem like a big undertaking with complex cross-functional challenges, so I can see the temptation to put it off. But the cookieless future is coming, whether you like it or not. Shifting away from cookies is a burden, and although you’ll have to sacrifice, you may gain a new perspective, and learn how to market to your users while respecting their privacy.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember the lack of visibility and data issues you’re already facing and how this will step-function degrade as we speed towards H2 2024</li>
<li>Completely cookieless performance marketing is achievable</li>
<li>It takes cross functional alignment from all stakeholders: business insights, website, legal, leadership, etc.</li>
<li>There will be expected outcomes, and unexpected outcomes</li>
<li>Going cookieless forces you to get creative and to start re-imagining the way you do targeting, bidding, tracking, and procurement.</li>
</ul>
<p>We didn’t cover every challenge that we faced in this post, and we still (and will continue to) measure the impacts to KPIs eight months in.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Would we do this all over again?</p>
<p>Because Sentry values privacy and the future of the open internet, yes. We took a firm stance on this despite knowing that paid channels would get a major shake up. But if you work somewhere that will hold on tightly to their cookie banner and rapidly diminishing tracking, at minimum we would suggest the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Institute self-reported attribution somewhere in your conversion flow.</li>
<li>Move all paid channels to utilizing conversion APIs, hashed passbacks, offline uploads, etc. (because of the downsides we experienced firsthand without being able to use them.)</li>
<li>Have conversations about testing new channels that might not have as clear of a ROI as demand capture channels like paid search</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if visitors to your site notice nothing else, they’ll at least have one less cookie banner to dismiss, and that is a win for the entire web.</p>

When the wind gets going, their blades can spin at well over 200km per hour. It is easy to imagine careless birds getting chopped to bits. Campaigners often point to the possibility when opposing the building of new wind farms.</p><p data-component="paragraph">No one doubts that wind turbines do indeed kill at least some birds. But a new analysis of American data, published in <i>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</i>, suggests the numbers are negligible, and have little impact on bird populations.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Wind power has expanded dramatically in America over the past 20 years, from 2.6 gigawatts of installed capacity on land in 2000 to 122 gigawatts in 2020. Many studies have analysed the effects in specific locations or on specific bird species. But few have looked at the effects on wildlife at the population level. Enter Erik Katovich, an economist at the University of Geneva. Dr Katovich made use of the Christmas Bird Count, a citizen-science project run by the National Audubon Society, an American non-profit outfit. Volunteers count birds they spot over Christmas, and the society compiles the numbers. Its records stretch back over a century.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Dr Katovich assumed, reasonably, that if wind turbines harmed bird populations, then the numbers seen in the Christmas Bird Count would drop in places where new turbines had been built. He combined bird population and species maps with the locations and construction dates of all wind turbines in the United States, with the exceptions of Alaska and Hawaii, between 2000 and 2020. He found that building turbines had no discernible effect on bird populations. That reassuring finding held even when he looked specifically at large birds like hawks, vultures and eagles that many people believe are particularly vulnerable to being struck.</p><p data-component="paragraph">But Dr Katovich did not confine his analysis to wind power alone. He also examined oil-and-gas extraction. Like wind power, this has <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2021/07/10/the-mother-frackers-of-shale-now-resemble-opec">boomed</a> in America over the past couple of decades, with the rise of shale gas produced by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, of rocks. Production rose from 37m cubic metres in 2007 to 740m cubic metres in 2020.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Comparing bird populations to the locations of new gas wells revealed an average 15% drop in bird numbers when new wells were drilled, probably due to a combination of noise, air pollution and the disturbance of rivers and ponds that many birds rely upon. When drilling happened in places designated by the National Audubon Society as “important bird areas”, bird numbers instead dropped by 25%. Such places are typically migration hubs, feeding grounds or breeding locations.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Wind power, in other words, not only produces far less planet-heating carbon dioxide and methane than do fossil fuels. It appears to be significantly less damaging to wildlife, too. Yet that is not the impression you would get from reading the news. Dr Katovich found 173 stories in major American news outlets reporting the supposed negative effects that wind turbines had on birds in 2020, compared with only 46 stories discussing the effects of oil-and-gas wells. Wind turbines might look dramatic. But their effect on birds is not. <span>■</span></p><p data-component="paragraph"><i>Curious about the world?

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mfkl.github.io/2024/01/10/unity-double-oss-standards.html">https://mfkl.github.io/2024/01/10/unity-double-oss-standards.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38964972">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
        <h2 id="vlc-for-unity-integration">VLC for Unity integration</h2>

<p>For the readers unaware, we started distributing binaries on the Unity Store for the open-source <a href="https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc-unity">VLC for Unity</a> integration back in December 2019.</p>

<p>The integration essentially was a bridge between the Unity game engine and the VLC multimedia engine, allowing to build your own media-player based on VLC technology in Unity-based games. Both Unity, through Mono, and LibVLC are highly portable so this is a compelling argument for this cross-platform integration.</p>

<p>Since the start, we have had many users downloading the assets from the Unity Store for their Unity apps and games when requiring demanding multimedia solutions. We had 3 assets targeting specific platforms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Windows,</li>
  <li>UWP,</li>
  <li>Android.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="unity-store-ban">Unity Store ban</h2>

<p>This all changed at the end of the summer 2023 when Unity emailed us the following:</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://mfkl.github.io/assets/unity-store-email.png">
</p>

<p>And just like this, our <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/39987">publisher account was instantly banned</a>.</p>

<p>After <em>months</em> of slow back-and-forth over email trying to find a compromise, including offering to exclude LGPL code from the assets, Unity basically told us we were not welcome back to their Store, ever. <em>Even if we were to remove all LGPL code from the Unity package</em>.</p>

<p>Where it gets fun is that there are currently hundreds if not thousands of Unity assets that include LGPL dependencies (such as FFmpeg) in the Store <strong>right now</strong>. Enforcement is seemingly totally random, unless you get reported by someone, apparently.</p>

<p>It gets better… Unity itself, both the Editor and the runtime (which means <em>your shipped game</em>) <strong>is already using LGPL dependencies</strong>! Unity is built on libraries such as Lame, libiconv, libwebsockets and websockify.js (at least). Full list of open-source Unity dependencies <a href="https://gist.github.com/mfkl/ad5cbeadf144e52a762a09fac6a05a70">here</a>.</p>

<p>So Unity gets to use and benefit from LGPL open-source libraries, games built with Unity depend on LGPL code by default (hello glibc!), but publishers and Unity users are not allowed to do so through the Unity Store?</p>

<h2 id="introducing-the-videolabs-store">Introducing the <a href="https://videolabs.io/store">Videolabs Store</a></h2>

<p>Numerous companies make use of the LibVLC SDK and other related technologies (like FFmpeg).</p>

<p>Sometimes they will run into issues or request a new feature and while the community can sometimes help, the limited time of a few volunteers only goes so far. I have written about <a href="https://mfkl.github.io/2020/10/25/OSS-sutainability.html">OSS sustainability before</a> and that is very much on topic here.</p>

<p>It is in the best interest of both open-source project maintainers and commercial consumers to have a clear products and services offering for a given project, and that is what we have created with the <a href="https://videolabs.io/store">Videolabs Store</a> for both LibVLC and FFmpeg.</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://videolabs.io/store"><img src="https://mfkl.github.io/assets/vlabs-store-1.png"></a>
</p>

<p>If you are a company requiring multimedia products or consulting for your own projects, this store will be of interest to you.</p>

<h3 id="flexible-multimedia-consulting-packages">Flexible multimedia consulting packages</h3>

<p>The Videolabs team is composed of VLC and FFmpeg experts in most protocols, formats and platforms.</p>

<p>If you are using or planning to use LibVLC or FFmpeg in your project and need help, whether it be custom builds, bug fixes, SDK integration or simply answers to your questions for your specific needs, these packages are for you!</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://videolabs.io/store"><img src="https://mfkl.github.io/assets/vlabs-store-2.png"></a>
</p>

<p>We have created 3 multimedia consulting packages: 3 hours, 10 hours and 24 hours. They can be purchased for a one-time service or a monthly subscription.</p>

<p>No matter which OS platform or toolkit you are building with, we can help.</p>

<h3 id="other-products">Other products</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://videolabs.io/store/libvlcsharp/">LibVLCSharp commercial license</a> and the <a href="https://mfkl.gumroad.com/l/libvlc-good-parts">LibVLC ebook</a> can also be found in the <a href="https://videolabs.io/store">Videolabs Store</a>, as well as other upcoming products such as Kyber, our new ultra low latency game/desktop streaming and remote control SDK, and more game engine integration such as Unreal.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://videolabs.io/store/unity/">VLC Unity integration</a> can of course also be purchased from our Store. Stay tuned for more Unity platforms support coming later this month!</p>

<p>The Coral Dev Board Micro is a microcontroller board with a built-in camera, microphone, and Coral Edge TPU, allowing you to quickly prototype and deploy low-power embedded systems with on-device ML inferencing.</p>
<p>By combining the Cortex M4 and M7 processors with the Coral Edge TPU on this board, you can design systems that gracefully cascade from extreme low-power ML inferencing to more complex—yet still power-efficient—ML inferencing.</p>

a dial-up internet connection, I get anxious at the thought of any always-online product or service. My <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-build-a-smart-home-3319550/">smart home</a> is no different — I rely on it to automatically cool the room when I return home, light up my closet when I open the door, and match the color temperature of my lights to the sun’s position. Why should any of that require an internet connection? That train of thought is exactly what led me to build a fully offline smart home that doesn’t hinge on any third-party servers whatsoever. And here’s how you can do it, too.</p><div><h3>Are you considering building an offline smart home?</h3><p>11514 votes</p></div><p><h2>Why build an offline smart home?</h2></p><div><picture><source

biggest fears is that the manufacturer of a smart home product I use will go bankrupt and disappear overnight. It’s not an unfounded fear — just last year, smart home company Insteon abruptly announced that it would shut down its servers over financial difficulties. The servers would later return from the dead, but only because some loyal users acquired the entire company to keep its products alive. This isn’t a one-off example either — Philips stopped supporting its first-gen Hue Bridge in 2020 and MyQ’s garage door openers became incompatible with the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-assistant-838138/">Google Assistant</a> without warning in 2023.</p><p>Many also care about the privacy implications of having cheaply made devices connect to the internet, but that’s a relatively smaller concern for me. Nevertheless, an offline smart home setup insulates me from both potential bankruptcy and privacy invasions.</p><p><q>An offline smart home is private, less expensive, and yours forever.</q></p><p>If those two reasons aren’t enough, you can sometimes also save a few bucks going the offline route. Instead of paying a premium for smart coffee makers or washing machines, you can retrofit almost any existing appliance with smart plugs and switches. Those can often be controlled without an internet connection, making them much more reliable than manufacturer ecosystems.</p><p>In my smart home setup, I haven’t explicitly blocked <strong>all</strong> devices from connecting to their manufacturer’s servers. About half of them still remain accessible via their official apps, just in case. But in day-to-day use, they’re all controlled by an offline hub and every single automation runs locally. If I were to disconnect my internet connection, they’d still continue working normally till the heat death of the universe. Or until a few batteries inevitably run out.</p><p><h2>How I built my offline smart home</h2></p><div><picture><source sizes="(min-width: 64rem) 51.25rem, 80vw"

ever looked into building a locally-controlled smart home, you’ve probably come across <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/" target="_blank">Home Assistant</a>. It’s a truly excellent piece of open-source software, maintained by enthusiasts from around the world. As a result, it’s not aligned with any smart home brand in particular and doesn’t need profitability or user growth to stay alive. Getting started with Home Assistant is dead simple; you simply install it on a low-power computer like the inexpensive Raspberry Pi. From that point on, you can configure your entire smart home using a smartphone or laptop.</p><p>Home Assistant uses code underneath its pretty UI for its automations, scenes, and other actions but you don’t need to worry about that at all. The graphical user interface has improved leaps and bounds in recent years and you can achieve just about anything without touching a single line of code.

Assistant community has also built blueprints that you can import for niche devices like the Aqara Magic Cube (pictured above). Typically, you’d need Aqara’s Hub and have to configure the cube’s actions via the official app. Thanks to Home Assistant, however, I don’t need another app or hub.</p><p>Hub aside, I use a mix of Wi-Fi and Zigbee devices throughout my home. <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-zigbee-3251685/">Zigbee</a> is the wireless mesh protocol behind many ecosystems like Philips Hue and IKEA Tradfri. With such ecosystems, however, you’ll often need to buy a brand-specific hub. Home Assistant once again lets you sidestep that requirement — simply plug in a single Zigbee USB dongle and build your own brand-agnostic network.</p><p><q>Zigbee helped take my smart home offline for good.</q></p><p>Some devices can be a bit problematic but there’s always a workaround. Take my robot vacuum, for example. I bought it over five years ago — long before I had any inkling of the broader smart home market. Luckily, the first-gen Xiaomi robot vacuum (and a few others) can be rooted and flashed to run <a href="https://valetudo.cloud/" target="_blank">Valetudo</a>, a cloud replacement software. Do I recommend installing it on your device? Only if you can figure out the basics of a Linux filesystem and are comfortable with reading documentation. Don’t worry if not, I’ll recommend some alternative vacuums in the next section.</p><p>Home Assistant maintains over 2,500 integrations. This means support for nearly all major brands and platforms like Philips Hue, Nanoleaf, Sonos, Plex, and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-google-nest-products-1208215/">Google Nest</a>. You can go even further with custom integrations since it’s an open platform.</p><p>All of this means that Home Assistant can create automations between brands even if they don’t play nicely with each other. I use an IKEA-branded wireless switch to dim my Xiaomi lights, turn on my LG air conditioner, and open the Plex app on my webOS TV. This may be possible with Alexa or Google Home routines, but the depth of device support in Home Assistant is staggering. Not to mention, every interaction is processed instantaneously since no packets leave my home network.</p><p><h2>How to build your own offline smart home</h2></p><div><picture><source sizes="(min-width: 64rem) 51.25rem, 80vw" srcset="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-scaled.jpeg.webp 1920w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-300w-170h.jpeg.webp 300w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-1200w-675h.jpeg.webp 1200w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-768w-432h.jpeg.webp 768w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-1536w-864h.jpeg.webp 1536w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-2048w-1152h.jpeg.webp 2048w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-16w-9h.jpeg.webp 16w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-32w-18h.jpeg.webp 32w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-28w-16h.jpeg.webp 28w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-56w-32h.jpeg.webp 56w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-64w-36h.jpeg.webp 64w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-712w-400h.jpeg.webp 712w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-1000w-563h.jpeg.webp 1000w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-792w-446h.jpeg.webp 792w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-1280w-720h.jpeg.webp 1280w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-840w-472h.jpeg.webp 840w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-1340w-754h.jpeg.webp 1340w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-770w-433h.jpeg.webp 770w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-355w-200h.jpeg.webp 355w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-675w-380h.jpeg.webp 675w" type="image/webp"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 64rem) 51.25rem, 80vw" title="smart home products" srcset="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-scaled.jpeg 1920w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-300w-170h.jpeg 300w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-1200w-675h.jpeg 1200w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-768w-432h.jpeg 768w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-1536w-864h.jpeg 1536w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-2048w-1152h.jpeg 2048w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-16w-9h.jpeg 16w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-32w-18h.jpeg 32w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-28w-16h.jpeg 28w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-56w-32h.jpeg 56w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-64w-36h.jpeg 64w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-712w-400h.jpeg 712w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-1000w-563h.jpeg 1000w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-792w-446h.jpeg 792w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-1280w-720h.jpeg 1280w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-840w-472h.jpeg 840w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-1340w-754h.jpeg 1340w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-770w-433h.jpeg 770w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-355w-200h.jpeg 355w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-675w-380h.jpeg 675w" alt="Assorted smart home products on a table" src="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smart-home-products-scaled.jpeg"></picture><div><p>Calvin Wankhede / Android Authority</p></div></div><p>While you can use many Wi-Fi-based smart home products offline, I’d recommend using Zigbee wherever possible. Such devices, whether a Philips Hue bulb or an IKEA remote, will directly connect to your hardware running Home Assistant. This also means faster communication and zero reliance on the brand for anything except optional firmware updates.</p><div><p>So with all of that in mind, here’s a list of the most common device categories and which brands I’d recommend for an offline smart home.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hub</strong>: Install Home Assistant on a <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/raspberry-pi-5-vs-raspberry-pi-4-3370847/">Raspberry Pi 5 or 4</a> and plug in a Zigbee USB stick (optional). Alternatively, pick up the <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/green/" target="_blank">Home Assistant Green</a> hub that’s pre-flashed and ready to go.</li>
<li><strong>Smart bulbs</strong>: For Wi-Fi, you can buy bulbs with offline firmware from Shelly and Athom. Xiaomi’s Yeelight sub-brand also offers official LAN control that you simply need to enable in the app. You have many more options with Zigbee. I prefer IKEA’s Tradfri line of Zigbee products as it strikes the perfect balance between quality and price, but you could also splurge on Philips Hue and myriad other brands.</li>
<li><strong>Switches and plugs</strong>: Inovelli’s Zigbee switches are a favorite in the Home Assistant community, but they aren’t cheap at $50 a pop. Zooz and Lutron come in a close second. You’ll find many more options for smart plugs, with offline-only options from Sonoff, IKEA, Athom, and Shelly.</li>
<li><strong>Sensors</strong>: Looking for the cheapest possible option? Sonoff’s range of sensors works reasonably well. However, I’d recommend Aqara or Aeotec products for better reliability, even though they need Zigbee and cost a bit more. I use IKEA’s motion sensors throughout my home and they work incredibly well too.</li>
<li><strong>Robot vacuum</strong>: Flashing the aforementioned Valetudo project isn’t for the faint of heart, but it’s the best option to keep your robot vacuum offline-only. Alternatively, Home Assistant officially supports Dreame and Roborock vacuums.</li>
<li><strong>Blinds</strong>: IKEA’s smart blinds are a favorite in the smart home community for their affordability and compatibility. I’ve also heard good things about Third Reality and Smartwings, which come equipped with Zigbee.</li>
<li><strong>Other appliances</strong>: Want to automate your AC, garage door, or ceiling fan that has its own remote? Use an inexpensive Wi-Fi IR or RF blaster. I saved $100 buying an AC without smart features, whereas my Broadlink RM Mini IR blaster cost just $20, and can also control my ceiling fan and TV in the same room.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list, of course, and I’ve only recommended reputable brands that shouldn’t compromise your data if you do connect them to the internet. Having said that, I’ve taken the more adventurous route for my own smart home and picked up a few bottom-of-the-barrel products off AliExpress.</p></div><p>These unbranded Wi-Fi products often use the Tuya Smart IoT platform, which integrates into Home Assistant via official and third-party integrations. These devices phone home surprisingly often, though, so they’re universally regarded as a bit of a privacy nightmare. One solution is to use the local Tuya custom integration and block those devices from accessing the internet with a firewall on your router. As I said earlier, Home Assistant offers a workaround for just about anything if you’re dedicated enough.</p><p><q>Cheap smart home products can also work offline, but take some time to set up.</q></p><p>Moving on, you don’t have to worry about losing voice control via Google Assistant, Siri, or Alexa. With some configuration, you can control all of your Home Assistant devices via your existing smart speakers and displays. I personally don’t need this functionality, though. I have wireless Zigbee switches placed all over my home to activate scenes and control lights.</p><p><h3>What about Thread and Matter?</h3></p><div><picture><source sizes="(min-width: 64rem) 51.25rem,

advocated for Zigbee so far, but you should know that another wireless mesh protocol is on the horizon: <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-thread-3205634/">Thread</a>. The good news is that you can add Thread support to your Home Assistant installation quite cheaply — it’s as easy as plugging in a USB dongle.</p><p>I’ve not made the switch because Thread and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/matter-smart-home-protocol-3082804/">Matter</a> are still quite barebones. We don’t have many Thread-compatible devices on the market to choose from either. That’s unlikely to change for a while as manufacturers work through some of Thread’s current challenges. For example, many Thread routers currently lack a way to add devices from other brands to their network. Without using something like Home Assistant then, this means you’re left with multiple different Thread networks that can’t talk to each other or share devices for automations.</p><p>Thread may replace Zigbee someday. But considering that Zigbee is a mature protocol with hundreds of devices available today, it remains my top choice and recommendation. I’m not alone either, this sentiment is echoed by many in the Home Assistant community.</p><p><h2>Is an offline smart home worth it?</h2></p><div><picture><source sizes="(min-width: 64rem) 51.25rem, 80vw" srcset="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-scaled.jpg.webp 2560w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-300w-170h.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-1200w-675h.jpg.webp 1200w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-768w-432h.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-1536w-864h.jpg.webp 1536w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-2048w-1152h.jpg.webp 2048w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-16w-9h.jpg.webp 16w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-32w-18h.jpg.webp 32w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-28w-16h.jpg.webp 28w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-56w-32h.jpg.webp 56w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-64w-36h.jpg.webp 64w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-712w-400h.jpg.webp 712w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-1000w-563h.jpg.webp 1000w" type="image/webp"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 64rem) 51.25rem, 80vw" title="floor lamp home assistant" srcset="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-300w-170h.jpg 300w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-1200w-675h.jpg 1200w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-768w-432h.jpg 768w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-1536w-864h.jpg 1536w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-2048w-1152h.jpg 2048w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-16w-9h.jpg 16w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-32w-18h.jpg 32w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-28w-16h.jpg 28w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-56w-32h.jpg 56w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-64w-36h.jpg 64w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-712w-400h.jpg 712w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-1000w-563h.jpg 1000w" alt="floor lamp home assistant" src="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/floor-lamp-home-assistant-scaled.jpg"></picture><div><p>Calvin Wankhede / Android Authority</p></div></div><p>Building my offline smart home took the better part of a weekend and it did require some research to know which products worked best offline.

In that vein, troubleshooting an offline smart home can be difficult when you don’t have physical access to the devices. For such homes, I’d still use a cloud-based solution like Google Home in conjunction with big-name brands that offer simplified setup processes.</p><p>Personally, though, I can’t imagine going back to the world of walled garden smart home ecosystems.

<h2 id="introducing-incremental-backups-in-postgres-17"><a href="#introducing-incremental-backups-in-postgres-17" aria-label="introducing incremental backups in postgres 17 permalink"></a>Introducing incremental backups in Postgres 17</h2>
<p>I was very excited earlier this week when I saw that <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=dc212340058b4e7ecfc5a7a81ec50e7a207bf288">Robert Haas committed</a> a way to have incremental backups <strong>directly in core Postgres</strong>.</p>
<p>When you run <code>pg_basebackup</code>, you now have the option to do incremental backups. The idea is that you could essentially say: “I do a full backup every 24 hours or every 7 days, and then do incremental backups that reference that full backup” – and the incremental backups would <strong>only contain the parts of the data files that have changed</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that this is different from what you do with the Write Ahead Log or "WAL" in Postgres. Let's imagine we have a point in time restore, and we want to recover to a point in time, yesterday at 5:00 PM, because something bad happened right after. Of course, we want to make sure that we can recover to the known <strong>good</strong> time. I can do that today in Postgres, but what I have to do is to go back to my most recent base backup, restore it first, and then replay the WAL from my WAL archive until the point that I want to restore to.</p>
<p>When you're replaying WAL, that actually <strong>has to apply all the changes</strong> that have occurred on the database. Imagine you're updating the same row over and over again. You’ll essentially have a lot of duplicate information in the WAL stream.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-of-incremental-updates-vs-wal"><a href="#benefits-of-incremental-updates-vs-wal" aria-label="benefits of incremental updates vs wal permalink"></a>Benefits of incremental updates vs. WAL</h3>
<p>Instead, with an incremental backup you actually have snapshots in time and you have the actual diff between the time you took the backup to the previous backup. It's much more efficient when you're doing a lot of updates because you have to do <strong>less work to get to a particular point in time</strong>, assuming you're doing more frequent backups thanks to the incremental backup feature.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a closer look at this.</p>
<h2 id="the-wal-summarizer-process"><a href="#the-wal-summarizer-process" aria-label="the wal summarizer process permalink"></a>The WAL summarizer process</h2>
<p>An important component to making this work is the <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=174c480508ac25568561443e6d4a82d5c1103487">WAL summarizer process</a>. This is a new process that was added, which aids incremental backups in <strong>determining which parts of the data directory have changed</strong> as compared to the last time a backup ran.</p>
<p>The idea is that you have a file which tells us which part of the table, or the index, have changed, and so then the incremental backup just needs to copy those parts of the files and it <strong>doesn't have to copy the full data file</strong>.</p>
<p>This is very efficient and whilst you could try to do something like this with other utilities, the benefit here is that this is already happening as Postgres is running, and so it's just saving additional metadata that then can be used by the incremental backup process. This is an <strong>optional feature</strong>, so we actually need to enable this flag to turn on the WAL summarizer.</p>

<h2 id="why-to-use-incremental-backups-in-postgres"><a href="#why-to-use-incremental-backups-in-postgres" aria-label="why to use incremental backups in postgres permalink"></a>Why to use incremental backups in Postgres</h2>
<p>The other thing I found interesting was to learn about how much of a difference this could make? Why do we need incremental backups in the first place?</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/CAKZiRmybH_v9C4WcnzAYtJwjCvmFsuFcMq1Tfx2s%2BRB9hOUyNA%40mail.gmail.com#fdf06fd7af2ae7879937bb571bc53db5">this mailing list thread</a> on the Postgres-hackers mailing list, Jakub from EDB ran a test. This is a <code>pgbench</code> test. The idea is that the data size doesn't really change much throughout this test. This is a 24 hour long test. At the start the database is 3.3GB. At the end, the database is 4.3GB. Then, as it's running, it's continuously running <code>pgbench</code> workloads. In those 24 hours, if you looked at the WAL archive, there were <strong>77 GB of WAL produced</strong>.</p>
<p>That's a lot of WAL to replay if you wanted to restore to a particular point in time within that timeframe!</p>
<p>Jakub ran one full backup in the beginning and then incremental backups every two hours. The full backup in the beginning is 3.4 GB, but then all the 11 other backups are 3.5 in total, they're essentially one 10th of a full backup size.</p>
<h3 id="a-10x-time-safe"><a href="#a-10x-time-safe" aria-label="a 10x time safe permalink"></a>A 10x time safe</h3>
<p>What Jakub tested then was the restore to a particular point in time. Previously, to restore to a particular point in time would take more than an hour to replay the WAL versus in this case  <strong>because we have more frequent, incremental backups, it's going to be much, much faster to restore</strong>. In this particular test case 78 minutes compared to 4 minutes. This is a more than a 10 times improvement in recovery time. Of course you won't necessarily always see this amount of benefit, but I think this shows why you might want to do this. It is because you want to enable more frequent backups and incremental backups are the way to do that.</p>

<p>Let's try this out. I have, locally, a running Postgres 17 development version. Do not trust this for any relevant data, right? This is very much heavy in development, but let's take a look at how this works.</p>
<p>Before we get started, we need to turn on the WAL summarizer process.  I'm going to do <code>ALTER SYSTEM SET summarize_wal = on</code>, and then I'm going to do a <code>SELECT pg_reload_conf()</code>.  This luckily is a reloadable setting. If you want to turn this on after the fact, you don't have to restart your database server, which is nice.</p>

<p>Now WAL summaries are going to be written. The idea is that each time you're running a checkpoint, that you will get another summary file here.</p>
<p>We want to do a base backup first, so we'll do pg_basebackup and we'll point this to the "backup1" directory. And then to speed this up, we'll actually do a CHECKPOINT because otherwise it does a slow checkpoint. In this case for testing, we want to do that fast. Now we have a "backup1" directory, 350 MB in size.</p>
<p>Let's <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/continuous-archiving.html#BACKUP-INCREMENTAL-BACKUP">make an incremental backup</a> and let's pass the backup manifest of that previous backup.</p>
<p>Our incremental backup in this case is only 48 MB.</p>
<p>If I do "backup3", I can pass my "backup2" backup manifest, the incremental backups can rely on each other, and then if I take a look at that, that's even smaller than the second one.</p>
<p>Now, what I need to do to be able to restore to the point of that "backup3", I now need to use <code>pg_combinebackup</code>. I combine "backup1", "backup2", "backup3" to "backup3_full".  Perfect. And so now if we take a look at "backup3_full", we should see that that one has the full size of a full backup.</p>
<p>And then let's start up another server. If we look at the log file, we'll see that that one came up successfully  and we can see that this the data as of a few minutes ago. Now we've successfully taken incremental backups, we've combined them into one working backup, and then we restored that server. This was obviously a lot faster than if I had to replay the WAL.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, this feature will save a lot of time and pain waiting for WAL replay because you can now do more frequent incremental backups and <strong>it's great to see this is part of Postgres core</strong> so that people can just do <code>pg_basebackup</code> and then use the incremental mode to have incremental backups work.</p>
<p>Very exciting. I hope this stays in Postgres 17, maybe it gets even further improvements, and so then next year, September, October timeframe, we can actually use this in production. And before we close: A quick logistical note, we're going to take a break over the holidays, and we'll be back with 5mins of Postgres on January 11th.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article" role="article"><p>When I was a kid there weren’t any technical limits on what I could get our computer to do. There were parental limits, common sense, and skill limits - but the computer that sat in our living room let me do whatever I wanted. That included everything from being able to use the OS to delete the OS (that’s how I learned what hidden files were) to the freedom of sliding open the side of the box to unplug things (that’s how I learned that you shouldn’t unplug cards while the computer is running just to see what they do). There are plenty of reasons to have guardrails on these things — trust and safety, users are dumb, etc. — but we also lose something in a world with too many guardrails: learning by tinkering.</p>
<p>When I tinkered with technology as a kid, I was learning how computers work. I wasn’t learning from classes or books, I was learning by flipping a switch and seeing what happened. Or, I was learning by wanting the computer to do something, <em>knowing</em> it was able to do it, and then browsing the depth of 1996 forums until I found something that did it.</p>
<p>How did I learn about basic networking? It wasn’t by some Khan Academy course someone put together to teach people how data moved over cables, the basics of packet switching, and the history of TCP/IP. No, it was because we had two computers, both of them had Age of Empires on them, and I wanted to play against my brother. So, I needed to figure out how LAN works, how to configure a network card, what a firewall was, etc. (Shoutout to my sister who I also “played against.”)</p>
<p>How did I learn about cloud storage? Well, I wanted to get a copy of Photoshop but I was probably ~8 so I obviously didn’t have the money to buy a copy of it. Upset that I wasn’t going to be able to edit whatever image I was working on, I moved on to some other corner of the web. There, I learned about this thing called FTP. I learned that <code>http:</code> did one thing and <code>ftp:</code> did something else. So, fresh with this knowledge and still upset that I didn’t have Photoshop, I experimentally put in <code>ftp://www.adobe.com</code>. To my astonishment, there was a list of all of the most recent releases of Adobe’s software. I was able to queue up a download of Photoshop and I was off to the proverbial races with our 56 kbit/s dial-up speeds. Along the way I learned about file trees, how to store files online, and also the thrill of finding something that wasn’t public knowledge. (Yes, I just checked and this doesn’t do anything anymore.)</p>
<p>How did I learn to make websites? Using my incredible skills highlighted above, I booted up Frontpage on our family desktop and started to poke around. It was a tool that made things easier for the user, but it didn’t lose the ability to get into the code and try out different things. I was able to bold something using the editor and then click over to the code and see that it did it using <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>. I was able to see what was happening and learn how to do it without guardrails. Was it great? No! It was terrible, the websites looked awful. But I did learn how websites worked.</p>
<p>What do all of these things have in common with each other? They were tinkering neutral. They weren’t designed from the ground-up to have people tinkering in them. But they also didn’t discourage tinkering. They tried to make things as easy on the user as possible, but they also recognized that the software designer is never going to be able to account for every conceivable edge case or user need. Whether the designers were self-consciously neutral or just didn’t care to lock it down, there weren’t locks on everything. And when you’re just starting to learn, a closed-but-unlocked door is an invitation to explore.</p>
<p>That’s sadly less the case nowadays. There’s a certain pride of “I know what needs to be built and everything else will be locked down” in today’s software. Some of that comes from valid security, trust, safety, and privacy concerns. But much of it is unnecessary. It’s in those unnecessary constraints that we losing the freedom to explore.</p></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">Disney-owned animation studio <a href="https://www.pixar.com/">Pixar</a> is poised to undergo layoffs this year, TechCrunch has learned and the company confirmed. While sources at the company said the layoffs would be significant and as high as 20% — or reductions that would see Pixar’s team of 1,300 dropped to less than 1,000 over the coming months — Pixar says those numbers are too high. Rather, the studio said the number of impacted employees is still being determined due to factors like production schedules and staffing for future greenlit films.</p>
<p>The studio stressed the layoffs are not imminent, but will take place later this year as Pixar focuses on making less content.</p>
<p>According to insiders, the Pixar layoffs include headcount that was hired for Disney+ — hires Disney pushed on Pixar to produce for its streaming division, which hasn’t yet turned a profit.</p>
<p>In Q4, Disney+ added 7 million new subscribers, bringing its total to <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-earnings-for-fiscal-2023/">150.2 million</a>, including Hotstar, beating analysts’ expectations of 148.15 million subscribers. Disney+’s ad-supported customers also grew by 2 million to reach 5.2 million, as more than 50% of new U.S. customers chose an ad-supported product.</p>
<p>A Disney subsidiary, Pixar is best known for films like “Finding Nemo,” “Monsters, Inc.” “WALL-E,” the “Toy Story” franchise, and others. It’s now the latest to be impacted by Disney’s cost-cutting measures, which the company said during its Q4 earnings would increase by an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/08/disney-dis-earnings-report-q4-2023.html">additional $2 billion to reach a target</a> of $7.5 billion, following a decrease in ad revenue from ABC and other TV stations and continued (though narrowing) losses within the Disney+ streaming division.</p>
<p>Disney said it expects to get its streaming service out of the red by Q4 2024 as a result of the “restructuring” of the company that “enabled tremendous efficiencies,” CEO Bob Iger told investors during earnings. In addition, it has been cutting down on its streaming losses. As of Q4 2022, Disney+ lost <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/08/1211522267/four-takeaways-from-disneys-earnings-call">nearly $1.5 billion; in Q4 2023, it lost “just” $387 million</a>.</p>
<p>Pixar’s “Elemental” was cited as one of the popular titles to hit the streaming platform in the quarter alongside other Disney and Marvel releases, like “The Little Mermaid” and “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.” “Elemental” had grossed half a billion worldwide, Disney said, and was the most-viewed film on Disney+ in the quarter, but was initially <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/elemental-box-office-bomb-pixar-1235648044/">considered a box office bomb</a> and one of the worst debuts in Pixar’s 28-year history. The film <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/business/media/elemental-pixar-box-office.html">made up for its poor opening over time</a>, but had followed <a href="https://screenrant.com/pixar-box-office-bombs-explained/">other under-performing titles</a> like “Lightyear” and “Onward,” which forced Disney to reconsider its release strategy.</p>
<p>Pixar’s “Onward,” released in March 2020, had run into issues due to the start of the COVID pandemic, but “Soul,” “Luca” and “Turning Red” were released directly to Disney+.</p>
<p>“Disney had more or less trained audiences to expect big, hot Pixar content at home,” explained <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katzb/">Brandon Katz</a>, an entertainment industry strategist at <a href="https://www.parrotanalytics.com/">Parrot Analytics</a>. “Retraining the audience to re-embrace the theatrical experience and prioritize that…takes time.”</p>
<p>Katz also noted that Pixar has had to contend with other changes in audience behavior and preferences, beyond the shift to streaming. For example, audiences in the 2010s preferred pre-established IP, which required less marketing and less buy-in from consumers. Now, audiences are facing sequel and franchise fatigue.</p>
<p>“That pendulum swing has been hard for all studios, Pixar included, to keep up with,” Katz added. “If you look at their box office history, [2017’s] ‘Coco’ was their last megabucks box office original — meaning, surpassing $500 million-plus worldwide.”</p>
<p>This year, the animation studio is set to release <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWavstJydZU">an “Inside Out” sequel</a> and, in 2025, “<a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/elio">Elio</a>,” a new film about a boy who goes on an intergalactic adventure. This pace could help keep Pixar’s budget in line, which tends to hover around $200 million per film, Katz noted. Other animation houses have smaller budgets, like $75-100 million at Illumination and $70-145 million at DreamWorks.</p>
<p>“Every single film when they’re at, 200 million plus, is going to require significant box office returns to break even and turn a profit,” he said.</p>
<p>Earlier in 2023, Pixar laid off 75 positions, including two executives behind “Lightyear,” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/walt-disneys-pixar-animation-eliminates-75-positions-2023-06-03/">Reuters reported</a>, including longtime animators Angus MacLane (“Toy Story 4,” “Coco”) and Galyn Susman, who had been with Pixar since the original “Toy Story.”&nbsp; Those cuts were part of Iger’s plan to reduce headcount by 7,000 jobs and $5.5 billion in costs, the report said.</p>
<p>“Turning streaming into a profitable growth business” was a top opportunity Iger cited for 2024, he told investors in Q4.</p>
<p>Also this year, Disney+ will gain Hulu content in the U.S., in another bid to boost its streaming business, mirroring other consolidation among its peers, including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/11/the-warner-bros-discovery-deal-has-officially-closed/">Warner Bros and Discovery merger</a> and a <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/01/paramount-skydance-national-amusements-all-cash-bid-1235710804/">rumored</a> <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/12/20/warner-bros-paramount-merger-discovery-streaming">Paramount</a> merger.</p>
<p>Disney execs at the <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-advertising-ces/">Consumer Electronics Show this week</a> in Las Vegas have been <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/disney-d23-espn-gateway-shop-ces-1235868337/">showcasing Disney’s ad tech</a> that works across its linear and streaming platforms, following 2023’s launch of ad-supported streaming on Disney+.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Turns out Google’s postpandemic reckoning didn’t just <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24033994/google-reorganization-fitbit-park-friedman-ar-layoffs">hit the Google Hardware team</a> responsible for Pixel, Nest, and Fitbit products — it’s taken similarly sized bites out of Google’s core engineering and Google Assistant teams too. Google just confirmed to <em>The Verge </em>that it’s eliminated “a few hundred” roles in <em>each</em> of these divisions, meaning Google has confirmed layoffs of around a thousand employees on Wednesday alone, if we use a reasonable definition of “few.”</p><p>And those are only the cuts we know about. We asked Google spokesperson Courtenay Mencini to say if this was the complete and total number of job cuts in this round of layoffs, but she stopped replying at that point, only confirming existing layoff reports at <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/01/10/google-reorganizing-hardware/"><em>9to5Google</em></a> and <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/01/10/2024/google-lays-off-hundreds-working-on-its-voice-activated-assistant"><em>Semafor</em></a>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/11/technology/google-layoffs.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reported on the engineering team layoffs too.<em> </em></p><p>When we spoke to Mencini earlier this evening about the Google hardware layoffs, she did not mention the other layoffs — but did write that “a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better” and that “some teams are continuing to make these kinds of organizational changes, which include some role eliminations globally.” </p><p>So there may be more, and it’s possible that Google is attempting to spread out the bad news instead of having it hit all at once.</p><p>Google parent firm Alphabet employed 182,381 employees as of September 30th, 2023, so roughly a thousand job cuts would only be around half a percent of the company’s total. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/14/23458204/meta-twitter-amazon-apple-layoffs-hiring-freezes-latest-tech-industry">There’s a lot of tech layoffs going around</a>.</p><p>If you know about more unreported layoffs, please tip us at tips@theverge.com.</p><p><em><strong>Update January 11th, 8:35AM ET: </strong>Removed speculation about the origin of other reports on Google’s layoffs.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.universalhub.com/2024/ebay-agrees-3-million-fine-trying-destroy-lives">https://www.universalhub.com/2024/ebay-agrees-3-million-fine-trying-destroy-lives</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38958798">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="content:encoded"><p>California-based online swapping-post concern eBay has agreed to a $3 million fine for <a href="https://www.universalhub.com/2020/feds-allege-ebay-terror-campaign-against-natick">the terror campaign</a> its executives and employees waged against a Natick couple who ran an <a href="https://www.ecommercebytes.com/">online news site</a> that published items the company didn't like, the US Attorney's office in Boston <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/ebay-inc-pay-3-million-connection-corporate-cyberstalking-campaign-targeting">reports</a>.</p>
<p>The fine is for the criminal charges the company faced in a new filing in US District Court in Boston today: Two counts of stalking through interstate travel, two counts of stalking through electronic communications services, one count of witness tampering and one count of obstruction of justice.</p>
<p>Separately, Ina and David Steiner have their own civil suit against the concern, which in 2019 launched a campaign that included sending them live cockroaches and spiders, a fetal pig, pizzas and a bloody-pig-face mask, sending pornographic magazines in David Steiner's name, posting bogus Craigslist ads for sexual events at their home and attempting to torment the couple through Twitter postings and direct messages. The items were purchased through Amazon and other online purveyors of such things.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, an eBay goon squad flew to Boston and attempted to harass and monitor the couple, in part by placing a GPS device on their car - all orchestrated from a Boston hotel where one executive listened to a Natick police channel to warn his fellow corporate thugs if police seemed to be on the way. Later, they lied to a Natick police detective, whom they derided as a stupid hick, only he proved to play a key role in their undoing when he went to the FBI for help.</p>
<p>Several of the executives and employees were arrested and convicted on federal charges. One executive, security head Jim Baugh, <a href="https://www.universalhub.com/2022/loathsome-ebay-executive-gets-nearly-five-years">got nearly five years in prison</a>. The company's CEO at the time, Devin Wenig, was referenced, but not by name, in federal charging documents. He was never charged, but did lose his job. In addition to Baugh, former head of security, the convicted eBay minions are:</p>
<blockquote><p>David Harville, former Director of Global Resiliency, who was sentenced to 24 months in prison in September 2022; Stephanie Popp, former Senior Manager of Global Intelligence, who was sentenced to 12 months in prison in October 2022; Philip Cooke, a former Senior Manager of Security Operations, who was sentenced to 18 months in prison and 12 months of home confinement in July 2021; Stephanie Stockwell and Veronica Zea, a former Manager of Global Intelligence and a contract intelligence analyst, respectively, who were each sentenced to one year in home confinement in October and November 2022. Brian Gilbert, a former Senior Manager of Security Operations, has pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing. </p></blockquote>

They started lowering hiring standards across the board because there just weren't enough people in tech.</p><p>Simultaneously, a huge portion of the world saw tech salaries and wanted in on it so they started taking every quick certification, bootcamp, degree, etc to get into tech.</p><p>It turns out that compared to the dedicated nerds of the previous generation, most new people just don't care that much about tech and don't want to go deeper than the bare minimum required by their job.</p><p>So I think tech overhired by a LOT, then they realized all these new people are actually net negatives on the company, and we are slowly correcting.</p><p>I think a solid 50% of people in tech are still on the chopping block. You can do much more with tools + really smart people in the year 2024 than you could before.

That isn't something that people get into as a hobby, that's work in a very unromantic sense. Maybe having good systems background can help in those situations, but it's a little more subtle</p><p>I do think though that it works the other way: people who actually care about computers don't care if tech is no longer a money field, they just want to work on computer stuff. And maybe earlier it wasn't as much of a money field. But that doesn't imply that the enthusiasts are better at fulfilling work responsibilities. A lot of work stuff is business specific and not very dependent on systems background</p><p>So yeah, I don't think the part about over-hiring is necessarily wrong, but this sort of "I'm better than you" attitude isn't very becoming.

I have lot more respect for the newer generation: what they have been served with and how they are handling it. The changes in last 10 or 20 years have far exceeded any changes I experienced in my first 0-40 years of life. And, imo newer generation has been adapting much better to such changes than the previous generations including my own. This adaption might come across not being "dedicated nerds" to previous generation but with the rapid change taking place, ability to adapt quickly trumps being "dedicated nerd."

Having been somewhere is often made up as great experience even if did not yield much experience, or one wasn't as involved as claimed, and even been somewhere is a lie. 
It is usually the opposite if I check known colleagues: null performers and phonies have outstanding profiles, the good or super programmer somtimes an awkward or does-not-care profile.</p><p>(But yeah, also admitting: Companies usually fire by the wrong metrics and even direct managers, which are bad managers, do not know the real differences of their underlings..)</p><p>&gt; notion of newer generation not being dedicated and smarter</p><p>Full agree, I don't think it is much new generation vs old, there are the same kind of great peoples.</p><p>But computer science really changed and grew. E.g. I strongly remember when I joined university 20 years or so ago how all tutors claimed how big our year is, and that before us everybody knew each other (profs/tutors/students), but now impossible. But still, 80-90% of the students that survived the first semesters just belonged there and would be great coders or computer scientists, with the right skills and ambitions. If you look nowadays, it is different and maybe more similar to other professions, and more 50/50 between those guys, and the other half which is ambitionless and/or just lack the skills, mindset, whatever, and would have better become something else. If you aks those some even freely admit they hate their job, but only drawn by the money.

I work at big tech co that went through massive rounds of layoffs. The criteria was a mixed bag. A lot of it was just entire products and associated teams being dismantled.<p>Also, one can make the argument the other way as well. Tools and infra have gotten good enough that the work doesn’t require the “dedicated nerds”. So let’s get rid of the highest paid engineers as that’s the most impactful to our bottom line. They coincidentally happen to be the nerds. We can always hire them back for less because what else are these nerds going to do in this market.</p><p>Not saying that’s the case but demonstrating that it’s pretty easy to string together silly notions we might have to explain reality.

OP put up a strawman on how the tech world is packed with incompetent new arrivals, but corporations are firing people indiscrimately by blindly cutting branches out of their org tree. Corporate's criteria to fire people is deciding which product they can either slow development, freeze, or even completely eliminate. This has absolutely nothing to do with the skills of whatever employees are covered by the firing rounds. These are pure business decisions which bear no connection with the tech aspect of their services. This is not bloat. In fact, I know for a fact that one FANG was still hiring midway through a round of layoffs and their HR was adamant in not even considering internal transfers for those positions. Are we expected to believe that employees who not only passed last year's hiring bar and received positive performance reviews are bloat, but today's new recruits are competent?

I remember massive tech companies running on teams of &lt;100 people, and even today, I hear of many critical departments with only around a dozen or less.</p><p>Google search, Github, AWS, Outlook, Facebook, Uber, IntelliJ. These are software behemoths, but at their core they’re rather simple, and a single developer could make an MVP of any in a few weeks, and with adequate testers and resources, something scalable and stable that could be used by professionals in a few months. And that’s creating it from scratch (well, existing libraries), though maintaining everything maybe doesn’t require much less, it surely doesn’t require more. I understand the big products have more, at least name recognition, and I understand that a big product needs more than programmers (asset creation, marketing, QA, tech support, accounting, etc.) But the software development side isn’t very big, especially if you already have the software.

All frameworks that dominate front-end and back-end components were created in the past decade, and leverage the same cloud-based competencies that new graduates learn.</p><p>If anything, new graduates are heads and shoulders above veterans, and the only thing that they miss is two decades of work experience. That can be an asset or a liability.</p><p>I also add that the bulk of &gt;15year veterans graduated in the 90s and 80s, which was a time when the academic world was still trying to figure out what it was supposed to teach in terms of software engineering, and most universities had basically scrambling to cover relevant topics. The graduates that went through those programs, unlike today's graduates, were woefully unprepared for the reality of software engineering. Two decades ago you could land a job by passing yourself as a "programmer" which meant you knew the syntax of a programming language such as Pascal or Cobol. That's the technical background of your average veteran with &gt;15years of experience.</p><p>Therefore, I think you are entirely wrong. If anything, the quality of your average tech worker improved greatly in the last 15 years. Those who arrived in the field actually hit the ground running in today's tech world and often push over and replace much senior team members. Those who enter the field from non-tech fields have the technical chops ro replace both veterans and new graduates. In today's world you need more than claim to know C or Java to actually land a job.</p><p>Disclaimer: I'm a veteran with &gt;15years of experience who worked at and was involved in the hiring process of a FANG.

Software was/is an emerging side business for that employer. This team completely lacked discipline and vision from a software execution perspective. The software was horribly organized, 80% of the logic was in SQL stored procedures, there was no test automation, and everything was copy/paste between environments. So, this was extremely high risk. The product side of the team, on the other hand, had extremely good discipline with a solid vision and extremely good documentation.</p><p>I was the only senior developer on the team with any advanced experience outside of SQL. It became super clear this employer was a mistake when they didn’t want me to fix anything and my junior peers back-stabbed me during 360s as salvation for their inability to communicate in writing. I just rode out the last several months until they eventually fired me when billable hours evaporated.</p><p>After a few months of looking for a new job I made a promise to myself to never EVER return to employment that feels immature. I would never take a job too reliant on frameworks and tools, such that the job/industry are compensating for talent with gimmicks. I abandoned my career writing JavaScript and eventually gained work in data science.

The rules of the game have changed.<p>&gt; We were allowed to expense all employee compensation tied to software or R&amp;D in the year in which we paid it. Now we can only expense a small fraction of that because we have to capitalize the expense. That means if you paid and developer $100 to develop a piece of software then sold subscriptions totaling $100 you now have a profit. The old model you have zero dollars in profit the new model says you have something like $80 in profit that you know have to pay taxes on… with what cash?</p><p>Additional "finger in the wind context": this change was brought about through the Trump Tax Cuts. My best guess is that Trump wanted the 174 change as a negotiation token to prod tech to make a deal. Mind you and me, this was all pre-pandemic. The financial world was pretty stable and this was going to be a 'great way' to make people work together, if desired. After the pandemic financial response, all bets were off.</p><p>Soloprenuers are the only one's somewhat immune. I'm thankful my companies needed to downsize before this.</p><p>Final context, there will be a whole new industry to define the useful life for a piece of software given the advancements in AI. This is going to be great fun.</p><p>[edit] One more thing, this change was thought to be “repeal-able” with new legislation. Since it no longer looks to be the case, to avoid “everything is securities fraud” (Matt Levine term), everyone has to adjust their public statements and accounting for this new change. Sure many of the big players will still make profit, but analysts only care about “beats and misses.” And since the legislation hasn’t passed to put the old rules back in place, accounting has to make these forecasts more permanent with less wiggle room - aka misses and forecasts down. Now, there is a huge op to trade the rules changing back - which would be a huge tailwind (made headcount cuts and get favorable tax treatment)

Investors love their group think so if you're doing something different during a time like this they're going to lose their shit (even more.)<p>For smaller companies the explanation is probably much simpler: there's less spending on new companies and therefore maximizing 'runaway' is critical. So if its not absolutely essential it needs to be cut. People who don't do that might not survive until things turn around, unfortunately. It's not a great situation to be in.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-77717">
	
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	
		<div data-first_letter="I">
		<p>In the weeks prior to Apple’s announcement of the first Apple silicon Macs in June 2020, there was intense speculation over how they would run existing macOS software. While most correctly recognised that this would be implemented using translation of x86 code as had been performed by Rosetta during the transition from PowerPC to Intel in 2006, some also saw a role for virtualisation. At the time <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2020/06/12/what-would-an-arm-based-mac-mean-to-us/">I wrote</a> that “Apple could provide a complete virtualisation layer which let users run most Intel Mac apps, and could even install and run Windows.”</p>
<p>A few days later Craig Federighi described three pillars to support a diversity of apps on Apple silicon: Universal apps containing code for both architectures, Rosetta 2 to translate x86 code, and virtualisation. At the time, the latter was promoted for hosting Linux and Docker, and Andreas Wendker demonstrated a pre-release version of Parallels Desktop running Linux as a guest.</p>
<h4>Hypervisor</h4>
<p>Apple had originally built support for the central requirement in virtualisation, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/hypervisor" target="_blank">the hypervisor</a>, back in OS X 10.10 Yosemite in 2014. That provides C APIs to virtualise in user space without the need for kernel extensions. On Intel Macs this provides hardware support in the VT-x feature set including Extended Page Tables (EPT) and Unrestricted Mode. This API doesn’t extend to providing support for drivers in the form of VirtIO devices, though.</p>
<h4>VirtIO</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, preparations for Apple silicon Macs were proceeding apace. Two new kernel extensions appeared around the time of Mojave, in 2018-19, apparently to provide initial support for VirtIO in AppleVirtIO and AppleVirtualGraphics, which reached version 2.1.3 with the update to 10.14.6 in July 2019, a year before the first Developer Transition Kit was to be released. Those developed rapidly in Catalina, reaching version 16.140.6 with 10.15.6 shortly after Apple’s announcement of Apple silicon.</p>
<p>Big Sur brought further additions to macOS that made it possible to demonstrate Linux running in a virtual machine. Parallels made no secret of its collaboration with Apple. The number of kernel extensions grew from the original two to five, with the addition of AppleParavirtGPU, AppleParavirtGPUMetal and AppleVirtualMCA. VirtIO, AppleVirtIO and AppleVirtualGraphics also advanced to version 74.50.1. Two frameworks joined those kexts: ParavirtualizedGraphics and Virtualization.</p>
<h4>Virtualization Extensions</h4>
<p>More fundamentally, Big Sur brought hardware support in what Apple termed its “Virtualization Extensions” presumably AArch64 virtualization as documented by Arm. This features an additional ‘exception level’, EL2 hypervisor, offering stage 2 translation, EL1/0 instruction and register access trapping, and virtual exception generation. Stage 2 translation allows a hypervisor to control which memory-mapped resources a VM can access, and where those appear in the VM’s address space, augmenting stage 1 translation controlled by operating systems. Trapping allows a hypervisor to trap operations, such as those configuring low level controls, and emulate them where necessary.</p>
<p>While Big Sur brought sufficient support for that brief demonstration by Andreas Wendker, it fell short of what was required for release, even following additional support by 11.5.2. At that stage, there were ten kernel extensions</p>
<ul>
<li>AppleParavirtGPU</li>
<li>AppleParavirtGPUIOGPUFamily</li>
<li>AppleParavirtGPUMetal</li>
<li>AppleParavirtGPUMetalIOGPUFamily</li>
<li>AppleParavirtIOSurface</li>
<li>AppleVirtIO</li>
<li>AppleVirtIOStorage</li>
<li>AppleVirtualGraphics</li>
<li>AppleVirtualMCA</li>
<li>AppleVirtualPlatform</li>
</ul>
<p>several of which were still in their first version. Apple had also added an audio plug-in, AppleVirtIOSound.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Lightweight virtualisation of macOS and Linux on Apple silicon was launched with limited support for Monterey at WWDC 2022 in Benjamin Poulain’s presentation explaining how simple it is to implement. He concluded by saying how the virtualisation team “cannot wait to see what you will do next with this technology”. Notable by its absence, though, was support for folders shared between macOS guest and host, that awaited the addition of the virtio file system to Ventura, and support of the built-in neural engine (ANE), which gained its own kernel extension AppleVirtIONeuralEngineDevice at the same time. Sonoma has since added two more kernel extensions, AppleVideoToolboxParavirtualization and AppleVirtIOBiometrics, as well as XPC services for the Virtualization framework for EventTap, Installation, LinuxRosetta, and VirtualMachine.</p>
<p>In addition to the hypervisor and VirtIO support, there were other hurdles to overcome for Apple silicon Macs to run a guest macOS. A standard macOS Installer app is insufficient to build a working VM, as it doesn’t contain most of the ‘firmware’ components required. Fortunately, those already come in the IPSW images used to perform a full restore to an Apple silicon Mac in DFU mode, and provide all the ingredients for installing a macOS VM.</p>
<p>As of Sonoma, there remain several outstanding issues that Apple has yet to address. Most significant is the thorny problem of Apple ID support, about which Apple has been silent. For those with ample Performance cores on their Ultra chips, Apple’s licensing limit of a maximum of two concurrent macOS VMs on any Mac is unnecessarily restrictive when they can virtualise as many instances of Linux as they want. Fewer, though, want to be able to nest virtualisation by running a VM inside another VM. Finally, those in Europe and many countries outside the US are keen for Apple to support ISO keyboard layouts in macOS VMs, which remains a surprising shortcoming. I’m sure there’s plenty more to come in the future.</p>
<h4>Milestones</h4>
<ul>
<li>2014 OS X 10.10: Hypervisor APIs (Intel).</li>
<li>2018 macOS 10.14: VirtIO kernel extensions.</li>
<li>2020 macOS 11 Big Sur: Linux VM demonstrated, Virtualization Extensions for Apple silicon.</li>
<li>2021 macOS 12 Monterey: first public support.</li>
<li>2022 macOS 13 Ventura: full support including virtiofs sharing.</li>
<li>2023 macOS 14 Sonoma: virtual display and other enhancements.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Soon after I started self-study in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory">Knot Theory</a>, I wanted to design a 24x36 wall poster with knots. I wanted to create it programmatically, starting from nothing but a list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_notation">Gauss Codes</a>. Last weekend I finally found the time. Here’s the result:</p>
<ol type="1">
</ol>
<p><a href="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/knottable_v1.svg"><img src="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/knottable_v1.svg" alt="Knot Theory Wall Poster"></a></p>
<p>The above image depicts all single-component prime links with 9 or fewer crossings (omitting their mirror images), plus some 10-crossing knots thrown in at the end.</p>
<p>When viewing the SVG image in its own browser tab, you can click any knot to zoom in. You can also redistribute the poster, print it, hack it, whatever; I’m releasing it into the public domain under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a>. You can also download <a href="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/knottable.jpg">this 8192x12288 JPEG</a> (6 MB).</p>
<p>If you print the poster for your classroom or office, consider letting me know. I am <a href="https://twitter.com/prideout">@prideout</a> on twitter. It will make me happy!</p>
<p>SVG is a nice file format for this use case. It’s great at drawing curves, it scales beautifully to any resolution, and doesn’t take much space.</p>
<p>I also love 3D depictions of knots, complete with lighting and specular highlights (<a href="https://prideout.net/knotgl/">see my old WebGL table</a>). However, to a mathematician, knots are more closely related to embeddings of 4-regular planar graphs than they are to real-world knots. For example, Reidemeister moves are one of the first things students learn about, and these moves are defined in the language of 2D knot projections.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-did-it"><a href="#how-i-did-it">How I did it</a></h2>
<p>To create these diagrams, I hacked together a Python pipeline that looks like this:</p>
<p><strong>Gauss Code » Combinatorial Embedding » Half-Edge Structure » Circle Packing » SVG</strong></p>
<p>I obtained the Gauss Codes from <a href="https://knotinfo.math.indiana.edu/">knotinfo</a> at Indiana University. I then added orientation information using a method described by Lou Kauffman in his paper <em>Virtual Knot Theory</em> and created <a href="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/gauss.json">this JSON file with the enhanced Gauss Codes</a>. The result is a list of <em>combinatorial embeddings</em>. At this point in the pipeline, each vertex is associated with a clockwise adjacency list, but actual vertex coordinates have not yet been assigned.</p>
<p>To find the faces in the combinatorial embedding, I found it useful to populate a half-edge data structure. Each face is discovered by winding one step around each 4-degree vertex. <a href="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/combined.json">This JSON file represents the half-edge data structure for each prime knot</a>.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-a-planar-layout"><a href="#choosing-a-planar-layout">Choosing a planar layout</a></h2>
<p>Next, I needed a way to come up with actual vertex coordinates. The classic way to do this is force-based layout. However I had a few interesting requirements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The edges should be represented by continuous curves, not straight lines.</li>
<li>The shadow of the knot (i.e.&nbsp;the 4-regular graph drawing) must have no edge intersections.</li>
<li>Ideally, the layout generator has no random seed or sensitivity to initial conditions, as is often seen in physics-based layout systems.</li>
</ol>
<p>The latter two requirements would be fulfilled with a Tutte Spring Embedding, but the result would not be aesthetically pleasing, nor would it have curved edges.</p>
<p>It turns out that there is a way to generate a nice planar diagram without force-based layout, using a special type of circle packing that preserves the clockwise adjacency list of each vertex. As a bonus, the circle packing is unique to a particular embedding of the knot, making it canonical and easy to reproduce.</p>
<h2 id="circle-packing"><a href="#circle-packing">Circle packing</a></h2>
<p>In William Thurston’s famous <em>Notes</em>, it was proven that any triangulation of a sphere has a corresponding circle packing. Similar results were discovered by E. Andreev and P. Koebe, so this theorem is sometimes referred to as the K-A-T (Koebe-Andreev-Thurston) Theorem. Kenneth Stephenson wrote a nice article about it in the 2003 Notices of the AMS entitled <em>Circle Packing: A Mathematical Tale</em>. In a separate paper, Stephenson and Collins describe an algorithm that consumes a combinatorial embedding of a planar graph and produces a circle packing where the tangency of the circles corresponds perfectly with the graph.</p>
<p>I ended up using Stephenson’s algorithm, but to simplify the rendering, I applied it to the “meta-graph” rather than the original combinatorial embedding. Each face, vertex and edge in the combinatorial embedding becomes a vertex in the meta-graph.</p>
<p>So, applying circle packing in this way produces three types of circles: faces, crossings, and arcs. This is shown below, using the 8<sub>11</sub> knot as an example. Each type of circle is drawn with a different pastel color.</p>
<p><img src="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/hero.svg" alt="The 8 11 Knot with Circles"><br>
</p>
<h2 id="details-choosing-the-outer-face"><a href="#details-choosing-the-outer-face">Details: choosing the outer face</a></h2>
<p>The following images are all the 8<sub>11</sub> knot, but with a different face chosen as the outside face. Some of these projections are not ideal because the circles in the outermost layer are much larger than the next-smallest layer. This causes crossings to become lost.</p>
<p><a href="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/8_11a.svg"><img src="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/8_11a.svg" alt="Projection a"></a> <a href="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/8_11b.svg"><img src="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/8_11b.svg" alt="Projection b"></a> <a href="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/8_11c.svg"><img src="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/8_11c.svg" alt="Projection c"></a> <a href="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/8_11d.svg"><img src="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/8_11d.svg" alt="Projection d"></a> <a href="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/8_11e.svg"><img src="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/8_11e.svg" alt="Projection e"></a> <a href="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/8_11f.svg"><img src="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/8_11f.svg" alt="Projection f"></a> <a href="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/8_11g.svg"><img src="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/8_11g.svg" alt="Projection g"></a> <a href="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/8_11h.svg"><img src="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/8_11h.svg" alt="Projection h"></a> <a href="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/8_11i.svg"><img src="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/8_11i.svg" alt="Projection i"></a> <a href="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/8_11j.svg"><img src="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/8_11j.svg" alt="Projection j"></a></p>
<p>I found that a good heuristic for choosing an outer face is to simply choose a face with a large number of edges.</p>
<h2 id="details-rendering-the-crossings"><a href="#details-rendering-the-crossings">Details: rendering the crossings</a></h2>
<p>2D knot diagrams typically employ a <em>trompe l’oeil</em> effect whereby a gap is used to distinguish an undercrossing from an overcrossing.</p>
<p>To achieve this effect, I did not simply terminate and re-start each cubic Bézier curves at appropriate points near the intersection, because a naive bevel angle does not look great with wide lines. I found it more aesthetically pleasing to render a “whiteout” line on top of the undercrossing and below the overcrossing, as shown below.</p>
<p><a href="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/layers.png"><img src="https://prideout.net/blog/svg_knots/layers.png" alt="Crossing Rendering Layers"></a></p>
<p>Note that a similar effect could be achieved with SVG’s <code>clipPath</code> facility.</p>
<p>Another detail that you probably noticed is that the thickness varies according to the enclosing circle; this means that I could not merely use SVG strokes, instead I had to convert the strokes into filled areas. To do this I cribbed the offsetting functionality in the <a href="https://github.com/simoncozens/beziers.py">Simon Cozens beziers library</a>.</p>

The trend has since stabilized, but remains at more than half of all “bad debt”.</p><p>In 2018, just 11.1% of hospitals’ bad debt came from insured “self-pay” accounts, or from patients whose insurance required out-of-pocket payments, according to Kodiak. By 2022, the proportion who did (or could) not pay their bills soared to 57.6% of all hospitals’ bad debt.</p><figure id="9aef8125-bc82-46a6-bd75-9bf8e8d8ce86" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutBlockElementV2"><gu-island name="CalloutBlockComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&quot;callout&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutBlockElementV2&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;51d5e65e-8d56-4a90-808e-1a3747e3c509&quot;,&quot;calloutsUrl&quot;:&quot;https://callouts.code.dev-guardianapis.com/formstack-campaign/submit&quot;,&quot;activeFrom&quot;:1698969600000,&quot;activeUntil&quot;:1706659200000,&quot;displayOnSensitive&quot;:false,&quot;formId&quot;:5514793,&quot;prompt&quot;:&quot;Share your experience&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;How have you been affected?&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;<p>We are interested in hearing from people in the US who have been affected by medical debt.</p>&quot;,&quot;tagName&quot;:&quot;callout-medical-debt&quot;,&quot;formFields&quot;:[{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;154209561&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;name&quot;,&quot;required&quot;:true,&quot;hideLabel&quot;:false,&quot;hidden&quot;:false,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Name&quot;},{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;154209562&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;where_do_you_live&quot;,&quot;required&quot;:true,&quot;hideLabel&quot;:false,&quot;hidden&quot;:false,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Where do you live?&quot;},{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;154209563&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;tell_us_a_bit_about_yourself_eg_age_and_what_you_do_for_a_living&quot;,&quot;required&quot;:false,&quot;hideLabel&quot;:false,&quot;hidden&quot;:false,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Tell us a bit about yourself (e.g. age and what you do for a living)&quot;},{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;154209564&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;textarea&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;share_your_experience_of_medical_debt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Include as much detail as possible&quot;,&quot;required&quot;:true,&quot;hideLabel&quot;:false,&quot;hidden&quot;:false,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Share your experience of medical debt&quot;},{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;154209576&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;textarea&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;how_has_it_affected_you&quot;,&quot;required&quot;:false,&quot;hideLabel&quot;:false,&quot;hidden&quot;:false,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;How has it affected you?&quot;},{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;154209565&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;file&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;if_you_are_happy_to_you_can_upload_a_photo_of_yourself_here&quot;,&quot;required&quot;:false,&quot;hideLabel&quot;:false,&quot;hidden&quot;:false,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;If you are happy to, you can upload a photo of yourself here&quot;},{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldRadio&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;154209566&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;radio&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;can_we_publish_your_response&quot;,&quot;required&quot;:true,&quot;hideLabel&quot;:false,&quot;hidden&quot;:false,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Can we publish your response?&quot;,&quot;options&quot;:[{&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Yes, entirely&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Yes, entirely&quot;},{&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Yes, but contact me first&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Yes, but contact me first&quot;},{&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Yes, but please keep me anonymous&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Yes, but please keep me anonymous&quot;},{&quot;label&quot;:&quot;No, this is information only&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;No, this is information only&quot;}]},{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;154209567&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;phone_number&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Your contact details are helpful so we can contact you for more information.

It was able to perform the analysis by looking at this in-house database.</p><p>The cost of healthcare in the US is a perennial political concern – it eats up more than 18% of gross domestic product, <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/383/bmj.p2340#:~:text=News-,US%20spends%20more%20than%20twice%20as%20much%20on%20health%20as,for%20worse%20outcomes%2C%20finds%20report&amp;text=The%20Commonwealth%20Fund%2C%20which%20supports,on%20excess%20US%20health%20spending." data-link-name="in body link">far more</a>, and often for worse health outcomes, than in other peer democracies. As much as <a href="https://www.aha.org/costsofcaring" data-link-name="in body link">31% of the cost of US healthcare</a> is probably driven by the administration of complex bills that now beset the public.</p><p>Now, medical debt and its impact on Americans’ lives is an issue of increasing political perseveration. A recent investigation by KFF Health News and NPR found more than 100 million Americans have medical debt of some kind, debt which often forces families to make <a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1198909604#:~:text=Nationwide%2C%20100%20million%20people%20have,from%20accessing%20care%20they%20need." data-link-name="in body link">heart-wrenching sacrifices</a>.</p><p>In part, those sacrifices are driven by hospitals’ extraordinary collection practices. Hospitals refer patients to <a href="https://nonprofitquarterly.org/nonprofit-hospitals-pursue-aggressive-medical-debt-collection/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBasically%2C%20two%20thirds%20of%20hospitals,can%20be%20devastating%20for%20patients." data-link-name="in body link">aggressive debt collectors</a>, use <a href="https://www.cssny.org/publications/entry/discharged-into-debt-new-yorks-nonprofit-hospitals-garnish-patients-wages" data-link-name="in body link">state courts to garnish wages</a>, place <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/06/hospitals-lawsuits-atrium-north-carolina" data-link-name="in body link">liens on people’s homes</a> and <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/medical-debt-anything-already-paid-or-under-500-should-no-longer-be-on-your-credit-report/" data-link-name="in body link">report debt to credit agencies</a>, which can drastically worsen future job and housing prospects. Although there are some <a href="https://www.barclaydamon.com/alerts/nys-governor-hochul-signs-legislation-prohibiting-hospitals-health-care-professionals-and-ambulance-companies-from-reporting-medical-debt-to-credit-agencies#:~:text=Unpaid%20medical%20debt%20will%20no,which%20went%20into%20effect%20immediately." data-link-name="in body link">attempts to rein in these practices</a>, billing analysts like Szaflarski say they do not address the core issue – health plans designed by insurers which force hospitals to become debt collectors.</p><p>“These stories really grind my gears,” said Szaflarski. “The idea of patient responsibility” – those deductibles and coinsurance requirements – “was not an idea created by healthcare providers. They were vehicles created by payers,” referring to insurers.</p><p>Ariel Levin, the director of coverage policy for the American Hospital Association, says the organization is discussing multiple solutions to challenges they say are created by insurer decisions.</p><p>“Something else we’re exploring recently is how to remove providers from the cost-sharing altogether and require health insurers to collect it,” Levin said.</p><p>Even seasoned professionals such as Levin have found it hard to decipher hospital bills, such as when her baby needed surgery.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-17">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-17" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>“It was really hard to look at my plan, even though I should be able to read the fine print and understand,” Levin said.</p><p>Deductibles have come under particular scrutiny as the share of workers subject to high deductibles has risen in the last decade. There is not a single definition for a high-deductible health plan, but typically such plans require a payment of <a href="https://www.kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2023-section-8-high-deductible-health-plans-with-savings-option/" data-link-name="in body link">$1,000 or more</a> before insurance kicks in for a single person – though costs can soar far above that. Because deductibles reset every year, they can be especially punishing for chronically ill patients – and they can be far more expensive than $1,000 a year.</p><p>“Obamacare” plans – that is insurance plans people buy as individuals on state exchanges – are notorious for such high deductibles. Federal regulations allow insurers on state exchanges to charge an individual as much as $9,450 out of pocket in 2024 – <em>not including</em> monthly payments called premiums. That limit is predicted to <a href="https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/aca-maximum-out-of-pocket-limit-is-growing-faster-than-wages/#Maximum%20out-of-pocket%20limits%20for%20HSA-qualified%20health%20plans%20and%20other%20private%20non-grandfathered%20health%20plans,%20actual%20(2014-2023)%20and%20projected%20(2024-2033)" data-link-name="in body link">grow to $14,100 by 2030</a>. And because healthcare costs are rising faster than wages, those expenses are predicted to eat up an ever-larger share of Americans’ paychecks.</p><p>Notably, it is unclear whether rising costs for patients alone explain the breaking point the Kodiak analysis saw in 2018. George W Bush signed an act in 2003 allowing insurers to sell such plans, and they <a href="https://www.kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2023-section-8-high-deductible-health-plans-with-savings-option/" data-link-name="in body link">quickly grew to represent about 30%</a> of the private employer insurance market by 2012. That proportion remains about the same today, and “cost-sharing” has continued to increase across all kinds of health plans.</p><p>“We have seen now that a lot of the debt we purchase and get rid of is also for insured patients,” said Ruth Landé, vice-president of hospital relations at RIP Medical Debt, and the former leader of a hospital billing team. RIP Medical Debt purchases hospitals’ debt portfolios and forgives the debt – part of an effort to relieve Americans of a burden many see as tacitly unfair.</p><p>Further, patient advocates criticize bad debt as a metric in its own right. Hospitals view bad debt as bills patients <em>could</em> pay but choose not to. But hospitals rarely screen patients for their ability to pay, and a <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_medical-debt-burden-in-the-united-states_report_2022-03.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">raft of evidence</a> shows patients who experience medical debt are often low-income and would probably qualify for discounted or free care if they went through hospitals’ lengthy application process.</p><p>Landé said when RIP acquires debt portfolios and matches accounts with third-party income data, it often shows the vast majority of patients with past-due debt would probably be eligible for free or discounted care if their finances were assessed. RIP provides debt relief to people with income that is four times the federal poverty level or less.</p><p>“It’s obvious to [hospitals] that if someone comes to them and is uninsured there’s a need there,” said Landé. “But if they’re insured,” and can’t afford their insurance, “their processes and systems are not designed to detect that need.”</p><ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Discord is laying off 17 percent of its staff, a move that CEO Jason Citron said is meant to “sharpen our focus and improve the way we work together to bring more agility to our organization.”</p><p>The cuts were announced today to employees in an all-hands meeting and internal memo I’ve obtained. They’ll impact 170 people across various departments.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on Citron’s message to employees and my understanding of the business, Discord isn’t in dire financial straits, though it has yet to become profitable and is still trying to revive user growth after a surge during the pandemic. In his memo to employees, which you can read in full below, Citron said Discord grew its headcount too fast over the last few years — an admission that has become quite common among tech CEOs as of late.</p><p>“We grew quickly and expanded our workforce even faster, increasing by 5x since 2020,” Citron wrote. “As a result, we took on more projects and became less efficient in how we operated.”</p><div><form action="#"><div><h2>Command Line</h2><p> / <span>A newsletter from Alex Heath about the tech industry’s inside conversation.</span></p></div></form></div><p>These cuts are Discord’s largest to date after the messaging app laid off 4 percent of staff last August. They add to the layoffs that continue to sweep across the tech industry, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/11/24034124/google-layoffs-engineering-assistant-hardware">deep cuts at Google</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24032187/twitch-layoffs-video-game-industry">Amazon just this week</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Discord has raised a total of about $1 billion in funding. It has more than $700 million in cash on its balance sheet and the goal to become profitable this year, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company has been contemplating going public since it turned down a $12 billion acquisition offer from Microsoft in 2021, though I’m told it’s nowhere near close to doing so.</p><p>Here’s Citron’s full memo to employees announcing the layoffs:</p><div><blockquote><p>Hi @everyone,</p><p>I want to follow up on what we just covered at our all-company meeting and share some context.</p><p>Today&nbsp;we are making the unfortunate and difficult decision to reduce the size of Discord’s workforce by 17%. This means we are saying goodbye to 170 of our talented colleagues. This is a decision we did not take lightly, but it is one that we have conviction in to better serve our users, our business and our mission over the long term.</p><p><strong>Where we are and how we got here</strong></p><p>Our company has changed and grown significantly over the past few years. We should all be really proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish together to serve the millions of people who turn to Discord every day to spend time with their friends.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, we have to face some hard truths. We grew quickly and expanded our workforce even faster, increasing by 5x since 2020. As a result, we took on more projects and became less efficient<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in how we operated.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we are increasingly clear on the need to sharpen our focus and improve the way we work together to bring more<strong>&nbsp;</strong>agility<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to our organization. This is what largely drove the decision to reduce the size of our workforce. While difficult,&nbsp;I am confident this&nbsp;will put us in the best position to continue building a strong and profitable business that delivers amazing products for our users and supports our mission for years to come.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What happens next</strong></p><p>I’m sure all of you are anxious to know what this means for each of you.</p><p><strong>- By 10:30 a.m. PT,&nbsp;</strong>everyone will receive an email. In your email, you will learn whether or not your employment has been impacted by this reduction-in-force</p><p>- Leadership will hold a meeting with&nbsp;<strong>departing team members at 11:00 a.m. PT</strong>&nbsp;to discuss next steps</p><p>- For all remaining employees, we will&nbsp;<strong>come back together&nbsp;this afternoon&nbsp;at 1:00 p.m. PT&nbsp;</strong>to talk about what’s next</p><p><strong>How we’re taking care of our colleagues</strong></p><p>It is incredibly important to me that we support departing team members through this difficult time and provide them with a sizable runway as they transition into future employment. To that end, we are offering them:&nbsp;</p><p>- Five months of salary (plus an additional week for every full year at Discord)</p><p>- Five months of benefit continuation</p><p>- Three months of outplacement services</p><p>- Equity vesting of awards scheduled to vest on Feb. 1, 2024</p><p>- Continued access to Modern Health through the end of 2024, and more</p><p>I’ll end by sharing deep appreciation and gratitude for those leaving us. Discord is better because of your contributions and the passion you brought to delivering for our users, our company, and each other. Thank you for everything.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s incredibly difficult to say goodbye to respected peers, many of whom have become friends. I’m hopeful that working on and with our product has reinforced that these bonds can be sustained and even strengthened beyond the “walls” of any one place.&nbsp;</p><p>Take care of yourselves and let’s look out for each other through this particularly challenging time.&nbsp;</p><p>Jason</p></blockquote></div></div></div>]]></description>

                    <p><em>In today’s Finshots, we go back over two decades to how a mega-merger leading to a clash of cultures might have been the downfall of Boeing.</em></p><p>Before we begin, if you're someone who loves to keep tabs on what's happening in the world of business and finance, then <a href="https://finshots.in/?utm_source=finshots&amp;utm_medium=newsletter#subscribe" rel="noopener noreferrer">hit subscribe</a> if you haven't already.

A gaping hole emerged, the wind rushed in, phones and caps were sucked out, oxygen masks dropped, and the passengers clung on for dear life.</p><p>The pilots made an emergency landing. And let’s just say that, luckily, everyone made it out alive.</p><p>But all eyes are on Boeing now. Its 737 Max 9 variant has been temporarily banned from taking off in the US. And the problem for Boeing is that it’s another body blow in a long series of problems in the past few years. Remember when two of its Max airlines plummeted to the ground in 2018 and killed hundreds of people on board?</p><p>Yeah, things aren’t looking good for the plane manufacturer. And we must ask — where did it all go so wrong for Boeing?</p><p>Well, it probably all began in the<a href="https://qz.com/1776080/how-the-mcdonnell-douglas-boeing-merger-led-to-the-737-max-crisis?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=Quartz_Daily_Brief_Asia&amp;utm_content=1851147566" rel="noopener"> summer of 1997</a>.</p><p>Boeing wanted to establish dominance and show the world who was boss in the airline industry. So it decided to acquire another plane manufacturer called McDonnell Douglas. It was a massive merger worth $14 billion.</p><p>Now after the merger, the new entity retained the Boeing name. It was expected since it was Boeing that splashed the cash. But the problem was that the culture of McDonnell Douglas seeped in. And that changed the face of Boeing completely.</p><p>See, the Boeing of the pre-merger era was called an ‘engineers’ company’. The ones who made these flying machines called the shots. Costs didn’t matter and it was only quality and design that did. They wanted to ensure that only their best ideas took to the skies. Safety was paramount. And the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/how-boeing-lost-its-bearings/602188/%5C" rel="noopener">Chief Financial Officer</a> who was answerable to Wall Street about costs didn’t care much about trying to impress the bankers either.</p><p>But after the merger, everything changed.</p><p>The CEO of McDonnell Douglas actually became the CEO of Boeing. A chairman with no aviation background, but who’d worked in General Electric, was also appointed. The company started paying attention to creating shareholder value which was hardly a priority earlier. And as one article put it, “Now, a passion for great planes was replaced with a passion for affordability.” Boeing even turned to <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/06/the-price-of-wall-streets-power" rel="noopener">outsourcing </a>critical operations. Sure, it made the balance sheet ‘asset light’, but, it came at the cost of quality.</p><p>To top it all off, they even moved management headquarters away from where all the engineering took place — from Seattle to Chicago.</p><p>At first, no one said anything. Sure, there was a joke that went, “McDonnell Douglas bought Boeing with Boeing’s money.” But it was a harmless observation. The planes kept rolling off the conveyor belt.</p><p>But then 2018 happened. And the death of Boeing’s culture came to the fore.</p><p>See, <a href="https://finshots.in/archive/boeing-gone/" rel="noopener">American Airlines</a> was looking to place an order with Boeing’s rival Airbus. Airbus had created the A320neo which was more fuel-efficient. And while initially, Boeing scoffed at Airbus, the call from American Airlines was a jolt out of the blue. That’s when Boeing realised it had fallen behind.</p><p>But it didn’t have time on its hands to innovate and build something from scratch. And that’s when the McDonnell Douglas way of doing things caught on — instead of spending $20 billion on a new plane, Boeing budgeted a <a href="https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/engineering-ethics-and-the-boeing-scandal" rel="noopener">puny $2.5 billion</a> and decided to tweak its iconic 737. Technical drawings for the model were being churned out at double the pace, workers from other departments were pulled in for the Max project, and timely delivery took precedence over quality. The idea was to make small but significant changes to 737 while sticking to the original design so that pilots wouldn’t really have to be retrained either.</p><p>But, flying a machine in the sky isn’t child’s play. Apparently, from 2010 to 2014, Boeing’s CEO never mentioned safety even once in their annual statement. And we all know what happens when ethics and quality fly out of the window!</p><p>And in 2018, when two 737 Max planes crashed and killed hundreds of people, everyone knew that it was the billion-dollar merger with McDonnell Douglas that ultimately became Boeing’s downfall.</p><p>The sad part?</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1d6aa5bb-b162-4217-912a-b698c84e5d00" rel="noopener">problems</a> don’t seem to be ending.</p><p>In the past couple of years, Boeing has said that some of its aircraft might have loose bolts that could be dangerous. It said that one of its suppliers drilled holes in the wrong places for some jets. And it even stumbled in its quest to build the US President’s new Air Force One.</p><p>For Boeing, the merger from 1997 is coming back to haunt it. The Max is the best-selling plane in Boeing’s history. And 76% of the company’s outstanding order book involves variants of these aircraft. And it’ll be a tough task to convince people that Boeing has not forgotten how to build an aeroplane.</p><p>Until then…</p><p><em>Don't forget to share this article on <a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=An%20explainer%20on%20how%20a%20mega-merger%20from%20the%201990s%20might%20have%20led%20to%20the%20downfall%20of%20Boeing.%20https://bit.ly/47t8Zzi">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://finshots.in/archive/did-a-1997-merger-ruin-boeing">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://bit.ly/48qIhsC&amp;via=finshots&amp;text=An%20explainer%20on%20how%20a%20mega-merger%20from%20the%201990s%20might%20have%20led%20to%20the%20downfall%20of%20Boeing.">X (formerly Twitter).</a></em></p><p>PS: No Indian carrier has the Max 9 aircraft model in their fleet.
