            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/360952/summer-travel-airport-facial-recognition-scan">https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/360952/summer-travel-airport-facial-recognition-scan</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41051327">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Here’s something I’m embarrassed to admit: Even though I’ve been reporting on <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/27/18518598/ai-facial-recognition-ban-apple-amazon-microsoft">the problems</a> with <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/5/16/18625137/ai-facial-recognition-ban-san-francisco-surveillance">facial recognition</a> for <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/08/china-surveillance-technology-muslims/567443/">half a dozen years</a>, I have allowed my face to be scanned at airports. Not once. Not twice. Many times. </p><p>There are lots of reasons for that. For one thing, traveling is stressful. I feel time pressure to make it to my gate quickly and social pressure not to hold up long lines. (This alone makes it feel like I’m not truly consenting to the face scans so much as being coerced into them.) Plus, I’m always getting “randomly selected” for additional screenings, maybe because of my Middle Eastern background. So I get nervous about doing anything that might lead to extra delays or interrogations.</p><p>But the main reason I haven’t declined airport face scans is actually very simple: I had no idea I could opt out. </p><p>It turns out that saying no is not only doable, but <a href="https://keepbeyond.com/optout/">surprisingly easy</a> — at least in theory. Everyone, regardless of citizenship, can opt out when it comes to domestic flights in the US. (For international flights, US citizens can opt out but foreign nationals have to participate in face scanning, <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/about/congressional-resources/testimony/statement-record-assessing-cbps-use-facial-recognition-technology">with some exceptions</a>.) Simply stand away from the camera or keep your face covered with a mask, present your ID, and say, “I opt out of biometrics. I want the standard verification process.” </p><div><p>In theory, an officer is then supposed to manually look over your ID and compare it to your face, as they used to do before facial recognition. But in practice, there have been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/11/tsa-airport-security-facial-recognition/">reports of passengers — even a senator — facing resistance or intimidation</a> when they try to go this route. </p></div><p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) are also supposed to have clear signs informing passengers of the right to opt out. But at many airports, you have to look really, really hard to spot that message. Be prepared to crane your neck at an unnatural angle or squint at a very small font!</p><p>This is why the Algorithmic Justice League, a nonprofit that sheds light on AI harms, launched a campaign this month called <a href="https://www.ajl.org/campaigns/fly">“Freedom Flyers”</a> to raise awareness of your right to opt out. The timing is perfect: The TSA <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/transportation/4738416-transportation-security-administration-record-air-travel-day/">recorded</a> an all-time record day for air travel on June 23, with nearly 3 million people screened at the country’s airports as summer vacation season picked up. </p><p>Now is the ideal time to make sure you know your rights when you pass through airport security — and understand exactly what’s at stake. The implications go way beyond air travel. </p><div><p id="how-facial-recognition-works-at-the-airport"><h2>How facial recognition works at the airport</h2></p></div><p>In the US, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/facial-recognition-tsa-airport-security-privacy-7b97462591c49184d1cb19cda9c95211">over 80 airports</a> are currently piloting facial recognition technology. The TSA’s goal is to roll out the tech in all of the more than 430 airports that it covers, <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/tsa_biometrics_roadmap.pdf">arguing</a> that this kind of automation would reduce “friction” at airports — meaning, presumably, how long it takes passengers to move through security. </p><p>That should raise some eyebrows, because there are known risks with this AI technology, from the possibility that your face data will be <a href="https://www.oversight.gov/report/dhs/review-cbps-major-cybersecurity-incident-during-2019-biometric-pilot">stolen due to breaches</a> to the chance that you’ll be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html">misidentified as a criminal suspect — and jailed</a>. Neither of these are hypothetical scenarios; the former has happened due to CBP system vulnerabilities and the latter has happened at the hands of police. And then, of course, there’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22916602/ai-bias-fairness-tradeoffs-artificial-intelligence">AI bias</a>; facial recognition tech is known to disproportionately <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/19/18412674/ai-bias-facial-recognition-black-gay-transgender">misidentify people of color</a>. (A CBP spokesperson insisted that the agency’s facial comparison algorithm “shows virtually no measurable differential performance in results based on demographic factors.”)</p><p>But as dangerous as face recognition can be if it goes wrong, a greater concern could be what happens if it’s seen to work as intended. When I asked <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23365558/future-perfect-50-ai-joy-buolamwini-founder-algorithmic-justice-league">Joy Buolamwini</a>, the founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, what worries her about the use of this tech in airports, she said, “The big one for me is normalizing surveillance.”</p><p>Buolamwini argued that airport face recognition is a way of acclimating the public to having more and more sensitive information taken. “I see this on a longer trajectory,” she said. “And they’ve shown you the trajectory.”</p><p>She was referring to <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/tsa_biometrics_roadmap.pdf">a roadmap released in 2018 by the TSA</a>. It distinguishes between two types of facial recognition: There’s one-to-one matching, where the TSA compares the photo in your passport with the photo they take of you at the airport, to make sure that the photos match. (If you ever use your face to unlock your iPhone, this is the kind of facial recognition you’re using.)</p><p>Then there’s one-to-many matching, where your image is compared with images of others. One-to-many matching is already in use by CBP and airline partners in that they compare a passenger’s photo to a database of government documents (like US passports) for verification, TSA press secretary Carter Langston told me by email.</p><p>A particularly worrisome form of one-to-many matching is live biometrics. “Live biometrics is the <em>Minority Report</em> kind of thing — where you’re just walking around and they can identify you,” Buolamwini said. And if everyone’s face becomes fair game for live biometrics, your likeness could one day be checked against a criminal database any time you walk through a drug store or show up at a protest, which may <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/5/16/18625137/ai-facial-recognition-ban-san-francisco-surveillance">create a dangerous chilling effect</a> across society. </p><p>The TSA’s own 2018 roadmap says they aim to use “live biometrics” in the future. However, Langston disputed Buolamwini’s interpretation of that term. “That interpretation of TSA’s use case is nothing that I have heard anyone involved in the program indicate. TSA’s use case is and continues to be about identity verification,” he told me.</p><p>For now, Buolamwini said, “You might hear people say ‘Oh, we’re only doing one-to-one matching. You show us your ID, you show us your face, and we delete the data.’” But, she stressed, the full story is more complicated.</p><div><p id="do-airports-really-delete-your-photo-after-taking-it"><h2>Do airports really delete your photo after taking it?</h2></p></div><p>The first thing to know is that if you’re not a US citizen, you have no guarantee that your photo will be deleted. </p><p>In fact, <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2022-Sep/CPE%20Final%20Report%20Traveler%20Verification%20Service%2020220815%20Final_%20Redacted_0.pdf">according to CBP documents</a>, “Facial images for in-scope [noncitizen] travelers are also transmitted to the Department’s Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) and Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology System (HART). All biometrics of in-scope travelers are transmitted to IDENT/HART as encounters and are retained for 75 years in support of immigration, border management, and law enforcement activities.”</p><p>That means your photo could end up in the database for the rest of your life. What’s more, CBP <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-pia-cbp056-tvs-february2021.pdf">notes</a> that “CBP may share information with federal, state, and local authorities, which may be authorized to use the information for purposes beyond the scope of CBP’s mission.”</p><p>If you’re a US citizen, you might breathe a bit easier upon reading on the CBP <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/travel/biometrics/biometric-privacy-policy">website</a>, “CBP retains U.S. citizen photos for no more than 12 hours after identity verification, and only for continuity of operations purposes.” But even so, Buolamwini says, there’s reason to wonder whether all your data is really deleted after those 12 hours.</p><p>When you submit to facial recognition, the tech analyzes a photo of your face and creates what’s called a “face print” or “face template.” This is not an image — it comes in the form of a series of numbers. You can think of it as your face’s metadata. </p><p>The problem is, even if airports do delete your photo, that does not necessarily mean they’re deleting your face print. And that face print is the real informational gold. Researchers have shown that <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8338413">they can reconstruct an image of your actual face</a> as long as they’ve got the face print. </p><p>I asked CBP what happens to that precious series of numbers. A CBP spokesperson did not answer the question about whether face prints get deleted in time for publication. After we published this story, the CBP spokesperson said that “CBP does not store or share the templates generated during the matching process, for either US citizens or non-citizens.”</p><div><p id="if-youve-already-let-airports-scan-your-face-is-there-a-point-in-saying-no-next-time"><h2>If you’ve already let airports scan your face, is there a point in saying no next time?</h2></p></div><p>Maybe you’re in the same situation as me. Maybe you’ve already let airports scan your face. And maybe you’re wondering whether saying no in the future will make any difference, given that your face data is probably already in a database — or two — or three. (Separate from TSA, your individual airline may also scan your face instead of your boarding pass before letting you on the plane, though airlines <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/you-can-say-no-to-face-scans-for-airplane-boarding">say</a> you can opt out for domestic flights.)</p><p>Buolamwini’s opinion? It’s definitely still worth declining the face scan next time you fly. “Every opt-out opportunity is a way to vote for your biometric rights,” she said.</p><p>We’ve already seen that when there’s enough of a public outcry, it can lead to deletion of face data. After Facebook’s facial recognition system sparked a class-action lawsuit, government investigations, and public furor, the company ended up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/02/technology/facebook-facial-recognition.html">deleting the face prints of more than a billion users</a> in 2021. </p><p>“Face purges can and do happen,” Buolamwini said. </p><p>Remember, the TSA’s stated reason for rolling out facial recognition in airports is to minimize friction. If you’re unhappy about the use of the tech, you can consider generating more friction next time you fly. </p><div><p><em>A version of this story originally appeared in the </em><a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect"><em><strong>Future Perfect</strong></em></a><em> newsletter. </em><a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup"><em><strong>Sign up here!</strong></em></a></p></div><p><em><strong>Update, July 19, 2:30 pm ET: </strong>This story was originally published July 17 and has been updated with new comment from US Customs and Border Protection.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="How Olympics Officials Try to Catch “Motor Doping”"><p>A French cycling official confronts a rider suspected of doping and ends up jumping onto the hood of a van making a high-speed getaway. This isn’t a tragicomedy starring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9rard_Depardieu" target="_blank">Gérard Depardieu</a>, sending up the sport’s well-earned reputation for cheating. This scenario played out in May at the <a href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/motor-doping-suspect-runs-down-race-organiser-while-escaping-inspection" target="_blank">Routes de l’Oise cycling competition</a> near Paris, and the van was believed to contain evidence of a distinctly 21st-century cheat: a hidden electric motor.<strong></strong></p><p>Cyclists call it “motor doping.” At the Paris Olympics opening on Friday, officials will be deploying electromagnetic scanners and X-ray imaging to combat it, as cyclists race for gold in and around the French capital. The officials’ prey can be quite small: Cycling experts say just 20 or 30 watts of extra power is enough to tilt the field and clinch a race.</p><p>Motor doping has been confirmed only once in professional cycling, way back in 2016. And the sport’s governing body, the <a href="https://www.uci.org/" target="_blank"><u>Union Cycliste Internationale</u></a> (UCI), has since introduced increasingly sophisticated motor-detection methods. But illicit motors remain a scourge at high-profile amateur events like the Routes de l’Oise. Some top professionals, past and present, continue to raise an alarm.</p><p>“It’s 10 years now that we’re speaking about this…. If you want to settle this issue you have to invest.” <strong>—Jean-Christophe Péraud, former Union Cycliste Internationale official</strong></p><p>Riders and experts reached by <em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</a></em> say it’s unlikely that technological doping still exists at the professional level. “I’m confident it’s not happening any more. I think as soon as we began to speak about it, it stopped. Because at a high level it’s too dangerous for a team and an athlete,” says <a href="https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/jean-christophe-peraud" target="_blank"><u>Jean-Christophe Péraud</u></a>, an <a href="https://olympics.com/en/athletes/jean-christophe-peraud" target="_blank"><u>Olympic silver medalist</u></a> who <strong></strong>was UCI’s first <a href="https://www.uci.org/pressrelease/the-uci-presents-a-robust-action-plan-to-combat-technological-fraud/6omY2RZitUwewjShNVCAYH" target="_blank">Manager of Equipment and the Fight against Technological Fraud</a>. </p><p>But trust is limited. Cycling is still recovering from the scandals surrounding U.S. Olympian Lance Armstrong, whose extensive use of transfusions and drugs to boost blood-oxygen levels fueled <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/mar/09/lance-armstrong-uci-colluded-circ-report-cycling" target="_blank"><u>allegations of collusion by UCI officials</u></a> and threats to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE90E0ZX/" target="_blank"><u>boot cycling out of the Olympics</u></a>. </p><p>Many—including Péraud—say more vigilance is needed. The solution may be next-generation detection tech: onboard scanners that provide continuous assurance that human muscle alone is powering the sport’s dramatic sprints and climbs.</p><h2>How Officials Have Hunted for Motor Doping in Cycling</h2><p>Rumors of hidden motors first <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20100602-fabio-cancellara-youtube-video-motorized-bike-rubbish-cycling-cheating" target="_blank"><u>swirled into the mainstream in 2010</u></a> after a Swiss cyclist clinched several European events with stunning accelerations. At the time the UCI lacked means of detecting concealed motors, and its technical director promised to “speed up” work on a “quick and efficient way” to do so. </p><p>The UCI began with <a href="https://road.cc/content/news/188441-mechanical-doping-uci-tested-and-rejected-thermal-imaging-detect-motors" target="_blank"><u>infrared cameras</u></a>, but they are useless for pre- and post-race checks when a hidden motor is cold. Not until 2015, amidst <a href="https://www.espn.com/sports/endurance/story/_/id/13272428/endurance-sports-velonews-tour-de-france-leader-chris-froome-facing-more-accusations" target="_blank"><u>further motor doping rumors</u></a> and <a href="https://road.cc/content/news/186575-hidden-motors-used-strade-bianche-claims-french-tv-video#:~:text=Jean-Pierre%20Vedry,%20the%20former,no%20reply,%20no%20checks.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank"><u>allegations of UCI inaction</u></a>, did the organization begin beta testing a better tool: an iPad-based “magnetometric tablet” scanner. </p><p>According to the UCI, an adapter plugged into one of these tablet scanners creates an ambient magnetic field. Then, a magnetometer and custom software register disruptions to the field that may indicate the presence of metal or magnets in and around a bike’s carbon-fiber frame.</p><p>UCI’s tablets delivered in their debut appearance, at the 2016 Cyclocross World Championships held that year in Belgium. Scans of bikes at the rugged event—a blend of road and mountain biking—<a href="https://www.cxmagazine.com/motor-mechanical-doping-femke-van-den-driessche-suspected-2016-cyclocross-world-championships-update" target="_blank"><u>flagged a bike</u></a> bearing the name of local favorite Femke Van den Driessche. Closer inspection revealed a motor and battery lodged within the hollow frame element that angles down from a bike’s saddle to its pedals, and wires connecting the seat tube’s hidden hardware to a push-button switch under the handlebars. </p><p><img alt="person in biking gear pushing bike up a hill on muddy terrain" data-rm-shortcode-id="7595488c2c38efa50c0515ed1fc5e689" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/person-in-biking-gear-pushing-bike-up-a-hill-on-muddy-terrain.jpg?id=52956711&amp;width=980" height="1875" id="57041" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/person-in-biking-gear-pushing-bike-up-a-hill-on-muddy-terrain.jpg?id=52956711&amp;width=980" width="2500"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">In 2016, a concealed motor was found in a bike bearing Belgian cyclist Femke Van Den Driessche’s name at the world cyclo-cross championships.

(Giovambattista Lera, the amateur cyclist implicated earlier this year in France, <u><a href="https://road.cc/content/news/cyclist-accused-motor-doping-denies-wrong-doing-308633" target="_blank">also denies using electric assistance</a></u> in competition.)</p><p>The motor in Van den Driessche’s bike engaged with the bike’s crankshaft and added 200 W of power. The equipment’s Austrian manufacturer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015031645/http://www.vivax-assist.com/en/" target="_blank"><u>Vivax Drive</u></a>, is now defunct. But anyone with cash to spare can experience 200 W of extra push via a racer equipped by Monaco-based HPS-Bike, such as the HPS-equipped <a href="https://www.lotuscars.com/en-GB/type-136" target="_blank">Lotus Type 136 racing bike</a> from U.K. sports car producer Lotus Group, which starts at £15,199 (US $19,715).<strong></strong></p><p>HPS founder &amp; CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harry-gibbings-ab8065201/?originalSubdomain=mc" target="_blank"><u>Harry Gibbings</u></a> says the company seeks to empower weekend riders who don’t want to struggle up steep hills or who need an extra boost here and there to keep up with the pack. Gibbings says the technology is not available for retrofits, and is thus off limits to would-be cheats.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tedium.co/2024/07/23/linkedin-complex-linking-schemes/">https://tedium.co/2024/07/23/linkedin-complex-linking-schemes/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41049016">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p><strong>LinkedIn is a social network</strong> that deeply confuses me. It’s a social network that sends messages with such a level of vagueness, seemingly to ensure you’ll never figure them out.</p>
<p>It gamifies profile-viewing in a way that feels less professional and more creepy. Plus, it charges money—a lot of money—for most of its features. It’s a hugely successful network, one that some have suggested is the true heir to the “new Twitter” discourse.</p>
<p>But it has an algorithmic problem that must be called out: Despite the fact that “link” is literally in the network’s name, the network has an allergy towards external links.</p>
<p>And increasingly desperate posters and social media marketers are going through comically complex hoops to work around it. Recently, I caught a video from a guy named <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markpjung/">Mark P. Jung</a>, a consultant whose startup <a href="https://authorityb2b.com/">Authority B2B</a> basically teaches companies and desired influencers the road they need to take to attain LinkedIn success. And to me, it seemed like he was trying to sell some magic beans that appear to actually function.</p>
</div><div>
    
<p>Jung, in a video <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7220040502555897856/">shared by content marketer Lindsay McGuire</a>, characterizes the changes as “interesting UI decisions” made since Microsoft acquired the company about eight years ago, changes that have invalidated linking hacks used by the network in prior eras.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7220040502555897856/"><img data-src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/zeroclick.jpg" width="1000" height="529" alt="Zeroclick" src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/zeroclick.jpg"></a></p>
<p><em>Jung, in the video of his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7220040502555897856/">that drew attention recently</a>. The use of the term “zero-click” is telling.</em></p>
<p>“Back in the day, people used to sort of get around LinkedIn stuff by just dropping a link in the comments and saying, ‘Hey, check out the comments,’” Jung explains. “Problem is, LinkedIn actually parses if you're the first person to comment in your post, if you're the first person to add a link, even if you actually write, like, the website, but remove the .com and say ‘dot com,’ this algorithm is on to you. It's immediately going to take your post and downrank it.”</p>
<p>So basically, Jung explains the alternative options for sharing a link on LinkedIn as such:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Post your thing,</strong> making it sufficiently long so the algorithm might enjoy it.  </li>
<li><strong>Get a little engagement</strong> on said thing, so you signal the post has some interest.</li>
<li><strong>Wait about 15 or 20 minutes.</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Edit the post,</strong> adding content equivalent to up to 15 percent of the post length, including a URL (which you should shortlink, using a service like Bitly, because every character of the URL counts against the added length). </li>
<li><strong>If you did it right,</strong> watch number go up.</li>
</ol>
<p>Does that sound like a lot of work for a single social post? You betcha. You basically have to make this someone’s job because of how long it takes to do. And it’s likely why every post on LinkedIn is like 100,000 words.</p>
<p>To be clear, my beef is not with Jung, who knows how to build social influence and understands the secrets to algorithmic growth. He sounds like someone who spent his time in the salt mines and doesn’t particularly like that it works like this, either. That he knows about it, apparently having uncovered it through a bunch of trial and error with client work, and is sharing his secrets, is fair.</p>
<p>Rather, my issue is with LinkedIn itself, which has clearly put in a lot of work to devalue the link, even more than other networks that do the same thing, like Instagram and Facebook.</p>
<p>At the ISP and mobile provider level, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/zero-rating-what-it-is-why-you-should-care">there’s this concept called zero-rating</a>, in which an internet provider provides free access to a selection of sites without the sites counting against the bandwidth limits. (An example of this is T-Mobile <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/12/23/youtube_t_mobile_us/">limiting users to 480p-quality videos</a> when streaming on mobile, but requiring you to pay an upcharge for higher-quality videos.) It is seen as a controversial workaround for net neutrality rules—though, while it’s still out there, it has become less of a problem in developed nations as internet connections have gotten faster and more unlimited. LinkedIn is doing something similar with its platform, something called zero-click content, as Jung puts it.</p>
<p>The terminology Jung uses is more telling than you might expect—essentially, it basically implies a social media version of zero-rating, which is a very controversial concept on telecom circles. LinkedIn wants you to create more content for its platform, and it wants you to do so at the cost of any outwardly facing content. So, it downranks anything it sees as damaging to that goal, even if it means breaking the original point of the internet in the process. It is essentially the same concept as zero-rating, except at a more granular level.</p>
<p>The problem with this is twofold: First, it forces content on LinkedIn to take an extremely unnatural shape that doesn’t make sense for a social media platform, often extending well beyond what people want out of it, and two, it limits reach to anyone that doesn’t play by LinkedIn’s rules. It’s a free-trade issue, essentially, and LinkedIn is dominant enough in its niche of business content that a regulator should look into this.</p>
<p>In many ways, social media has these kinds of issues in spades—including on that site I still call Twitter, which has forced people to write gigantic threads instead of linking to blog posts, and Instagram, which is so dominant that it has allowed the creation of secondary businesses around the link in bio.</p>
<p>This is what social media has become, an attempt to work around algorithms, rather than a way to engage with people. <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2019/12/10/link-in-bio-is-how-they-tried-to-kill-the-web/">As Anil Dash wrote</a> back in 2019, with a focus on Instagram rather than LinkedIn, social media seems to be doing all it can to destroy the value of the link:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are some legitimate reasons platforms limit links. Spammers abuse links. Trust is hard to verify around links—too many scammers make links that look real, but lead to sketchy sites. Building a system to monitor all the links being posted on a big platform does take some cost. Maybe you can have a link again, if you are already in the 1% most influential users on the platform and put it in a story—the part of Instagram's experience that drives the engagement metrics they care about. Maybe you just give up, and pay for links, by buying advertising.</p>
<p>But killing off links is a strategy. It may be presented as a cost-saving measure, or as a way of reducing the sharing of untrusted links. But it is a strategy, designed to keep people from the open web, the place where they can control how, and whether, someone makes money off of an audience. The web is where we can make sites that don’t abuse data in the ways that Facebook properties do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re committed to one ecosystem or another, you’re really committed. And LinkedIn wants committed users. But on the other hand, people don’t run their entire lives on LinkedIn. It’s not like Nike or Blackstone or your local cupcake shop or your local neighborhood content hustlers can just live on LinkedIn. But LinkedIn acts as if that’s what you need to do to get ahead, and it feels like something we should start talking about in earnest.</p>
<p>What is the value of the link? Why are there so many barricades between the audience you’ve built and the link you want to share? (Hint: They think it’s not really your audience.) And when should regulators step in to ensure that our social networks aren’t impeding commerce by impeding links?</p>
<p>I know Lina Khan is pretty busy these days, but it feels like a question she might be well-suited to help answer.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/chinese-born-chemist-cleared-of-last-conviction-under-uss-espionage-probe/4019849.article">https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/chinese-born-chemist-cleared-of-last-conviction-under-uss-espionage-probe/4019849.article</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41048747">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Following a five-year legal battle, Chinese-born former University of Kansas chemistry professor Feng ‘Franklin’ Tao, who was <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/us-chemistry-professor-convicted-under-now-defunct-china-initiative/4015510.article">arrested and convicted under the former Trump administration’s now-defunct ‘China Initiative’</a>, has been vindicated. An appeals court in Denver, Colorado has <a href="https://x.com/Profleoyu/status/1811593615514259592">acquitted Tao of his one remaining conviction</a> that he made a false statement about his relationship with a Chinese university.</p>
<p>In April 2022, Tao – a permanent US resident who before his arrest in 2019 had served as a tenured associate professor at the University of Kansas since 2014 – was not only convicted of making a ‘materially false statement’, but also of three counts of wire fraud. He faced up to 20 years in prison and substantial fines. However, he <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/us-chemist-feng-tao-avoids-prison-sentence-for-hiding-ties-to-china/4016855.article">was subsequently acquitted of the wire fraud charges and so only the now-overturned false statements conviction remained</a>. Ultimately, he was sentenced to time served with a $100 (£81) fine.</p>
<p>At issue in the new ruling, issued 11 July, is whether Tao’s lack of disclosure about his affiliation with Fuzhou University in China affected federal agency funding decisions. The Denver appeals court agreed 2-1 that it was irrelevant because Tao had no grant proposals pending before those two agencies in question – the US Department of Energy and National Science Foundation – at the time he made his affiliation statement.</p>
<p>Tao’s lawyer, Peter Zeidenberg welcomed the court’s ruling. ‘Even though there was not a scintilla of evidence that Dr Tao was engaged in espionage or theft of trade secrets, the government nevertheless relentlessly investigated him and ultimately charged him with 10 felonies – all based on an alleged omission on a single internal form he submitted to the University of Kansas research office and which was never shared with any federal agency,’ he stated. Those initial 10 charges were first reduced to three, then one, and now zero.</p>
<p>Zeidenberg emphasised that Tao’s reputation has been ‘unfairly dragged to the mud’, and he was ‘wrongly fired’ by the University of Kansas. ‘Dr Tao, a world-renowned expert in catalysis, has been unable to do his research, depriving all of us who benefit from scientific advances,’ Zeidenberg continued, noting that his legal fight has virtually bankrupted his family. Even with assistance from friends and family and a GoFundMe campaign, Tao still owes over $1 million in legal fees, he said.</p>
<p>Tao was one of an estimated two dozen academics who were charged under the US government’s China Initiative. The programme, launched in<strong> </strong>2018 to counter trade secret theft and economic espionage, was widely criticised as racially biased and harmful to academic freedom. It was eventually <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/us-ends-anti-espionage-china-initiative/4015301.article">terminated under President Biden in 2022</a> following <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/us-programme-targeting-researchers-with-china-links-crumbling-under-intense-scrutiny/4014572.article">the dismissal of many of the government’s criminal cases that were brought against university researchers under the initiative</a>.</p>
<p>The Asian–American Scholar Forum <a href="https://www.aasforum.org/2024/07/17/aasf-celebrates-dr-franklin-taos-appeal-victory/">called Tao’s latest court win ‘a significant victory’</a> and celebrated it as ‘a crucial step toward rectifying the unjust treatment of Chinese American and immigrant scientists under the now-defunct China Initiative’.</p></div></div>]]></description>

In the United States, eh, not so much. In the latest news from across the Atlantic, Switzerland has taken a major step forward with its "<a href="https://datenrecht.ch/en/bundesgesetz-ueber-den-einsatz-elektronischer-mittel-zur-erfuellung-von-behoerdenaufgaben-embag-in-schlussabstimmung-angenommen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Federal Law on the Use of Electronic Means for the Fulfillment of Government Tasks" (EMBAG).</a> This groundbreaking legislation mandates using open-source software (OSS) in the public sector.</p><p>This new law requires all public bodies to disclose the source code of software developed by or for them unless third-party rights or security concerns prevent it. This "public money, public code" approach aims to enhance government operations' transparency, security, and efficiency.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/german-state-ditches-microsoft-for-linux-and-libreoffice/" rel="follow">German state ditches Microsoft for Linux and LibreOffice</a></strong></p><p>Making this move wasn't easy. It began in 2011 when the Swiss Federal Supreme Court <a href="https://www.openjustitia.ch/DE/interne_Open_Justitia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">published its court application, Open Justitia, under an OSS license</a>. The proprietary legal software company <a href="https://www.weblaw.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Weblaw</a> wasn't happy about this. There were heated political and legal fights for more than a decade. Finally, the EMBAG was passed in 2023. Now, the law not only allows the release of OSS by the Swiss government or its contractors, but also requires the code to be released under an open-source license "unless the rights of third parties or security-related reasons would exclude or restrict this."</p><p>Professor Dr. Matthias Stürmer, head of the Institute for Public Sector Transformation at the <a href="https://www.bfh.ch/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bern University of Applied Sciences</a>, led the fight for this law. He hailed it as&nbsp;<a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor/news/new-open-source-law-switzerland" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"a great opportunity for government, the IT industry, and society."</a> Stürmer believes everyone will benefit from this regulation, as it reduces vendor lock-in for the public sector, allows companies to expand their digital business solutions, and potentially leads to reduced IT costs and improved services for taxpayers.</p><!----><p>In addition to mandating OSS, the EMBAG also requires the release of non-personal and non-security-sensitive government data as Open Government Data (OGD). This dual "open by default" approach marks a significant paradigm shift towards greater openness and practical reuse of software and data.</p><p>Implementing the EMBAG is expected to serve as a model for other countries considering similar measures. It aims to promote digital sovereignty and encourage innovation and collaboration within the public sector.</p><p>The Swiss Federal Statistical Office (BFS) is leading the law's implementation, but the organizational and financial aspects of the OSS releases still need to be clarified.</p><p><strong>Also:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-dont-more-people-use-desktop-linux-i-have-a-theory-you-might-not-like/" rel="follow">Why don't more people use desktop Linux? I have a theory you might not like</a></strong></p><p>Other countries in Europe have long supported open source.

The European Union (EU) has long worked on securing OSS via the EU's&nbsp;<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/departments-and-executive-agencies/digital-services/eu-fossa-2-free-and-open-source-software-auditing_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Free and Open Source Software Auditing (FOSSA)</a> project.</p><p>That said, it's not all wine and roses in the EU. There's some worry that the European Commission will <a href="https://fossforce.com/2024/07/is-the-european-commission-dropping-support-for-important-open-source-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cut funding for the NGI Zero Commons Fund</a>, an important funding source for OSS projects.</p><p>In the US, there's some support for open source, but not nearly as much as in Europe.

    This is a card game for teaching kids how to combine unix commands through <mark>pipes</mark>.<p>
    This game assumes the parent knows the basic unix commands: <code>cat, grep, tail, head, wc, sort, uniq</code>. The parent should show also show those commands in action the computer as well, if you do not have any UNIX system you can use <a href="https://bellard.org/jslinux/vm.html?url=alpine-x86.cfg&amp;mem=192">jslinux</a> in your browser.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	
	<article>
		<p>Today we are announcing our intent to end <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol">Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)</a> support in favor of <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2022/09/07/new-life-for-crls">Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)</a> as soon as possible. OCSP and CRLs are both mechanisms by which CAs can communicate certificate revocation information, but CRLs have significant advantages over OCSP. Let’s Encrypt has been providing an OCSP responder since our launch nearly ten years ago. We added support for CRLs in 2022.</p>
<p>Websites and people who visit them will not be affected by this change, but some non-browser software might be.</p>
<p>We plan to end support for OCSP primarily because it represents a considerable risk to privacy on the Internet. When someone visits a website using a browser or other software that checks for certificate revocation via OCSP, the Certificate Authority (CA) operating the OCSP responder immediately becomes aware of which website is being visited from that visitor’s particular IP address. Even when a CA intentionally does not retain this information, as is the case with Let’s Encrypt, CAs could be legally compelled to collect it. CRLs do not have this issue.</p>
<p>We are also taking this step because keeping our CA infrastructure as simple as possible is critical for the continuity of compliance, reliability, and efficiency at Let’s Encrypt. For every year that we have existed, operating OCSP services has taken up considerable resources that can soon be better spent on other aspects of our operations. Now that we support CRLs, our OCSP service has become unnecessary.</p>
<p>In August of 2023 the <a href="https://cabforum.org/">CA/Browser Forum</a> passed <a href="https://lists.cabforum.org/pipermail/servercert-wg/2023-September/003998.html">a ballot</a> to make providing OCSP services optional for publicly trusted CAs like Let’s Encrypt. With one exception, Microsoft, the root programs themselves no longer require OCSP. As soon as the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/trusted-root/program-requirements">Microsoft Root Program</a> also makes OCSP optional, which we are optimistic will happen within the next six to twelve months, Let’s Encrypt intends to announce a specific and rapid timeline for shutting down our OCSP services. We hope to serve our last OCSP response between three and six months after that announcement. The best way to stay apprised of updates on these plans is to <a href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/c/api-announcements/18">subscribe to our API Announcements</a> category on Discourse.</p>
<p>We recommend that anyone relying on OCSP services today start the process of ending that reliance as soon as possible. If you use Let’s Encrypt certificates to secure non-browser communications such as a VPN, you should ensure that your software operates correctly if certificates contain no OCSP URL. Fortunately, most OCSP implementations “fail open” which means that an inability to fetch an OCSP response will not break the system.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><span>In the early days of high-performance computing, the major tech companies of the day each invested heavily in developing their own closed source versions of Unix. It was hard to imagine at the time that any other approach could develop such advanced software. Eventually though, open source Linux gained popularity – initially because it allowed developers to modify its code however they wanted and was more affordable, and over time because it became more advanced, more secure, and had a broader ecosystem supporting more capabilities than any closed Unix. Today, Linux is the industry standard foundation for both cloud computing and the operating systems that run most mobile devices – and we all benefit from superior products because of it.</span></p>
<p><span>I believe that AI will develop in a similar way. Today, several tech companies are developing leading closed models. But open source is quickly closing the gap. Last year, Llama 2 was only comparable to an older generation of models behind the frontier. This year, Llama 3 is competitive with the most advanced models and leading in some areas. Starting next year, we expect future Llama models to become the most advanced in the industry. But even before that, Llama is already leading on openness, modifiability, and cost efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span>Today we’re taking the next steps towards open source AI becoming the industry standard. We’re releasing Llama 3.1 405B, the first frontier-level open source AI model, as well as new and improved Llama 3.1 70B and 8B models. In addition to having significantly better cost/performance relative to closed models, the fact that the 405B model is open will make it the best choice for fine-tuning and distilling smaller models.</span></p>
<p><span>Beyond releasing these models, we’re working with a range of companies to grow the broader ecosystem. Amazon, Databricks, and Nvidia are launching full suites of services to support developers fine-tuning and distilling their own models. Innovators like Groq have built low-latency, low-cost inference serving for all the new models. The models will be available on all major clouds including AWS, Azure, Google, Oracle, and more. Companies like Scale.AI, Dell, Deloitte, and others are ready to help enterprises adopt Llama and train custom models with their own data. As the community grows and more companies develop new services, we can collectively make Llama the industry standard and bring the benefits of AI to everyone.</span></p>
<p><span>Meta is committed to open source AI. I’ll outline why I believe open source is the best development stack for you, why open sourcing Llama is good for Meta, and why open source AI is good for the world and therefore a platform that will be around for the long term.</span></p>
<h2><span>Why Open Source AI Is Good for Developers</span></h2>
<p><span>When I talk to developers, CEOs, and government officials across the world, I usually hear several themes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>We need to train, fine-tune, and distill our own models.</b><span> Every organization has different needs that are best met with models of different sizes that are trained or fine-tuned with their specific data. On-device tasks and classification tasks require small models, while more complicated tasks require larger models. Now you’ll be able to take the most advanced Llama models, continue training them with your own data and then distill them down to a model of your optimal size – without us or anyone else seeing your data.</span></li>
<li><b>We need to control our own destiny and not get locked into a closed vendor.</b><span> Many organizations don’t want to depend on models they cannot run and control themselves. They don’t want closed model providers to be able to change their model, alter their terms of use, or even stop serving them entirely. They also don’t want to get locked into a single cloud that has exclusive rights to a model. Open source enables a broad ecosystem of companies with compatible toolchains that you can move between easily.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>We need to protect our data.</b><span> Many organizations handle sensitive data that they need to secure and can’t send to closed models over cloud APIs. Other organizations simply don’t trust the closed model providers with their data. Open source addresses these issues by enabling you to run the models wherever you want. It is well-accepted that open source software tends to be more secure because it is developed more transparently.</span></li>
<li><b>We need a model that is efficient and affordable to run. </b><span>Developers can run inference on Llama 3.1 405B on their own infra at roughly 50% the cost of using closed models like GPT-4o, for both user-facing and offline inference tasks.</span></li>
<li><b>We want to invest in the ecosystem that’s going to be the standard for the long term.</b><span> Lots of people see that open source is advancing at a faster rate than closed models, and they want to build their systems on the architecture that will give them the greatest advantage long term.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span>Why Open Source AI Is Good for Meta</span></h2>
<p><span>Meta’s business model is about building the best experiences and services for people. To do this, we must ensure that we always have access to the best technology, and that we’re not locking into a competitor’s closed ecosystem where they can restrict what we build.</span></p>
<p><span>One of my formative experiences has been building our services constrained by what Apple will let us build on their platforms. Between the way they tax developers, the arbitrary rules they apply, and all the product innovations they block from shipping, it’s clear that Meta and many other companies would be freed up to build much better services for people if we could build the best versions of our products and competitors were not able to constrain what we could build. On a philosophical level, this is a major reason why I believe so strongly in building open ecosystems in AI and AR/VR for the next generation of computing.</span></p>
<p><span>People often ask if I’m worried about giving up a technical advantage by open sourcing Llama, but I think this misses the big picture for a few reasons:</span></p>
<p><span>First, to ensure that we have access to the best technology and aren’t locked into a closed ecosystem over the long term, Llama needs to develop into a full ecosystem of tools, efficiency improvements, silicon optimizations, and other integrations. If we were the only company using Llama, this ecosystem wouldn’t develop and we’d fare no better than the closed variants of Unix.</span></p>
<p><span>Second, I expect AI development will continue to be very competitive, which means that open sourcing any given model isn’t giving away a massive advantage over the next best models at that point in time. The path for Llama to become the industry standard is by being consistently competitive, efficient, and open generation after generation.</span></p>
<p><span>Third, a key difference between Meta and closed model providers is that selling access to AI models isn’t our business model. That means openly releasing Llama doesn’t undercut our revenue, sustainability, or ability to invest in research like it does for closed providers. (This is one reason several closed providers consistently lobby governments against open source.)</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, Meta has a long history of open source projects and successes. We’ve saved billions of dollars by releasing our server, network, and data center designs with Open Compute Project and having supply chains standardize on our designs. We benefited from the ecosystem’s innovations by open sourcing leading tools like PyTorch, React, and many more tools. This approach has consistently worked for us when we stick with it over the long term.</span></p>
<h2><span>Why Open Source AI Is Good for the World</span></h2>
<p><span>I believe that open source is necessary for a positive AI future. AI has more potential than any other modern technology to increase human productivity, creativity, and quality of life – and to accelerate economic growth while unlocking progress in medical and scientific research. Open source will ensure that more people around the world have access to the benefits and opportunities of AI, that power isn’t concentrated in the hands of a small number of companies, and that the technology can be deployed more evenly and safely across society.</span></p>
<p><span>There is an ongoing debate about the safety of open source AI models, and my view is that open source AI will be safer than the alternatives. I think governments will conclude it’s in their interest to support open source because it will make the world more prosperous and safer.</span></p>
<p><span>My framework for understanding safety is that we need to protect against two categories of harm: unintentional and intentional. Unintentional harm is when an AI system may cause harm even when it was not the intent of those running it to do so. For example, modern AI models may inadvertently give bad health advice. Or, in more futuristic scenarios, some worry that models may unintentionally self-replicate or hyper-optimize goals to the detriment of humanity. Intentional harm is when a bad actor uses an AI model with the goal of causing harm.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s worth noting that unintentional harm covers the majority of concerns people have around AI – ranging from what influence AI systems will have on the billions of people who will use them to most of the truly catastrophic science fiction scenarios for humanity. On this front, open source should be significantly safer since the systems are more transparent and can be widely scrutinized. Historically, open source software has been more secure for this reason. Similarly, using Llama with its safety systems like Llama Guard will likely be safer and more secure than closed models. For this reason, most conversations around open source AI safety focus on intentional harm.</span></p>
<p><span>Our safety process includes rigorous testing and red-teaming to assess whether our models are capable of meaningful harm, with the goal of mitigating risks before release. Since the models are open, anyone is capable of testing for themselves as well. We must keep in mind that these models are trained by information that’s already on the internet, so the starting point when considering harm should be whether a model can facilitate more harm than information that can quickly be retrieved from Google or other search results.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When reasoning about intentional harm, it’s helpful to distinguish between what individual or small scale actors may be able to do as opposed to what large scale actors like nation states with vast resources may be able to do.</span></p>
<p><span>At some point in the future, individual bad actors may be able to use the intelligence of AI models to fabricate entirely new harms from the information available on the internet. At this point, the balance of power will be critical to AI safety. I think it will be better to live in a world where AI is widely deployed so that larger actors can check the power of smaller bad actors. This is how we’ve managed security on our social networks – our more robust AI systems identify and stop threats from less sophisticated actors who often use smaller scale AI systems. More broadly, larger institutions deploying AI at scale will promote security and stability across society. As long as everyone has access to similar generations of models – which open source promotes – then governments and institutions with more compute resources will be able to check bad actors with less compute.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The next question is how the US and democratic nations should handle the threat of states with massive resources like China. The United States’ advantage is decentralized and open innovation. Some people argue that we must close our models to prevent China from gaining access to them, but my view is that this will not work and will only disadvantage the US and its allies. Our adversaries are great at espionage, stealing models that fit on a thumb drive is relatively easy, and most tech companies are far from operating in a way that would make this more difficult. It seems most likely that a world of only closed models results in a small number of big companies plus our geopolitical adversaries having access to leading models, while startups, universities, and small businesses miss out on opportunities. Plus, constraining American innovation to closed development increases the chance that we don’t lead at all. Instead, I think our best strategy is to build a robust open ecosystem and have our leading companies work closely with our government and allies to ensure they can best take advantage of the latest advances and achieve a sustainable first-mover advantage over the long term.</span></p>
<p><span>When you consider the opportunities ahead, remember that most of today’s leading tech companies and scientific research are built on open source software. The next generation of companies and research will use open source AI if we collectively invest in it. That includes startups just getting off the ground as well as people in universities and countries that may not have the resources to develop their own state-of-the-art AI from scratch.</span></p>
<p><span>The bottom line is that open source AI represents the world’s best shot at harnessing this technology to create the greatest economic opportunity and security for everyone.</span></p>
<h2><span>Let’s Build This Together</span></h2>
<p><span>With past Llama models, Meta developed them for ourselves and then released them, but didn’t focus much on building a broader ecosystem. We’re taking a different approach with this release. We’re building teams internally to enable as many developers and partners as possible to use Llama, and we’re actively building partnerships so that more companies in the ecosystem can offer unique functionality to their customers as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I believe the Llama 3.1 release will be an inflection point in the industry where most developers begin to primarily use open source, and I expect that approach to only grow from here. I hope you’ll join us on this journey to bring the benefits of AI to everyone in the world.</span></p>

<p>f3 is a simple tool that tests flash cards capacity and performance to
see if they live up to claimed specifications. It fills the device with
pseudorandom data and then checks if it returns the same on reading.</p>
<p>F3 stands for Fight Flash Fraud, or Fight Fake Flash.</p>

<h3>Drive Permissions / Passthrough<a href="#drive-permissions-passthrough" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Getting the drive device to map into the Docker container is tricky for Mac and
Windows.  Passing through devices on Mac and Windows is a well-documented issue
(<a href="https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3110#issuecomment-456853036">[github]</a>
<a href="https://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/4572/how-to-pass-a-dev-disk-device-on-macos-into-linux-docker/6076#6076">[stackexchange]</a>
<a href="https://christopherjmcclellan.wordpress.com/2019/04/21/using-usb-with-docker-for-mac/#tldr">[tty]</a>)
On Linux it should just work, but on Mac or Windows, Docker tends to map the
drive as a normal directory rather than a mounted drive and you will get an
error like <code><span>f3probe:</span> <span>Can't</span> <span>open</span> <span>device</span> <span>'/opt/usb':</span> <span>Is</span> <span>a</span> <span>directory</span></code>, that
is if you can map it at all.</p>
<p>To solve this, we can use docker-machine to create a VirtualBox VM
(boot2docker), in which to run the Docker container.  Since VirtualBox <em>can</em>
handle device pass-through, we can pass the device through to the VirtualBox VM
which can then pass the device through to the Docker container.  Milad Alizadeh
wrote up some good instructions <a href="https://mil.ad/blog/2018/access-usb-devices-in-container-in-mac.html">here</a>
which are geared towards USB devices, but it shouldn’t be too hard to adapt to
other drive types.  Here’s what I typed into my Mac terminal (probably
similar for Windows, but untested):</p>
<div><pre><span></span>docker-machine create -d virtualbox default
docker-machine stop
vboxmanage modifyvm default --usb on
docker-machine start
vboxmanage usbfilter add <span>0</span> --target default --name flashdrive --vendorid 0x0123 --productid 0x4567
<span>eval</span> <span>$(</span>docker-machine env default<span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>For the usbfilter add command, note that the “name” argument is the new name
you’re giving the filter so you can name it whatever you want.
<code><span>--vendorid</span></code> and <code><span>--productid</span></code> can be found on Mac in “System
Information” under “USB”. You can also try searching for the right device in
<code><span>vboxmanage</span> <span>list</span> <span>usbhost</span></code>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may opt to add the device through the VirtualBox GUI
application instead:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>docker-machine create -d virtualbox default
docker-machine stop
<span># open VirtualBox and manually add the drive device before proceeding to the next command</span>
docker-machine start
<span>eval</span> <span>$(</span>docker-machine env default<span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Once you’ve run the above commands, unplug and replug the flash drive and run:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>docker-machine ssh default <span>"lsblk"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>to list the devices. Search for the correct drive - the “SIZE” column may be
helpful in locating the device of interest. For example, <code><span>sdb</span></code> is a common
mount point for a USB drive.  Now you should be able to run the command from
Quick Start:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>docker run --rm -it --device /dev/sdX peron/f3 f3probe --destructive --time-ops /dev/sdX
</pre></div>
<p>You may find it useful to enter a bash prompt in the Docker container to poke
around the filesystem:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>docker run --rm -it --device /dev/sdX peron/f3 bash
</pre></div>
<p>so that you can run commands like <code><span>ls</span> <span>/dev/*</span></code>.</p>

then you can use <a href="https://github.com/whitslack/flakyflash">Flakyflash</a>
to find the flaky data clusters and mark them as bad in the FAT. This
may allow you to get a little more use out of your flash, but you
should still consider it as failing and replace it ASAP.</p>

<li><strong>Input blocks</strong> are for you to add interactive elements to your notebook, like text inputs or dropdowns.</li>
<li><strong>Visualization blocks</strong> are for you to create visualizations without writing any code.</li>

<p>To do that, you can start by using a query block to fetch the signups from your database. This query block will automatically create a dataframe containing the query's results.</p>
<p>Then, you can use this dataframe in Python blocks to aggregate the data by month and create a plot using <code>matplotlib</code> or <code>seaborn</code>, for example.</p>

<p>In the Python block, the AI assistant is aware of the existing dataframes and its columns.</p>
<p>In the SQL block, the AI assistant already knows the tables and columns in your database, so it can give better suggestions and help you get complex queries right.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>
For the past few days, I have been toying with an idea for a board game. To test
it out, I wanted to write a simple implementation of it. Here’s an example of a
type we might need in a critical phase of the game.
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>-- | A quote for a proposal.</span>
<span>data</span> <span>Quote</span> <span>=</span> <span>Quote</span>
  { _proposal <span>::</span> <span>Proposal</span>
  , _premium <span>::</span> <span>Int</span>
  , _share <span>::</span> <span>Int</span>
  }
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In that phase, values of this type need to be communicated back and forth
between players in a unicast fashion, so we might want to add fields to indicate
who sent it and who received it.
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>-- | A quote that has both owner and offering player.</span>
<span>data</span> <span>QuoteEtc</span> <span>=</span> <span>QuoteEtc</span>
  { _proposal <span>::</span> <span>Proposal</span>
  , _premium <span>::</span> <span>Int</span>
  , _share <span>::</span> <span>Int</span>
  , _owner <span>::</span> <span>PlayerId</span> <span>-- ^ Player that owns the process.</span>
  , _offering <span>::</span> <span>PlayerId</span> <span>-- ^ Player that offers this quote.</span>
  }
</pre>
</div>

<p>
But then I realised there are quite a lot of these types where source-and-target
fields are required, and that we could annotate them without modifying the
underlying type, by creating another type to hold that data:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>-- | Create a unicast message from any type a.</span>
<span>data</span> <span>Msg</span> a <span>=</span> <span>Msg</span>
  { _sender <span>::</span> <span>PlayerId</span>
  , _recipient <span>::</span> <span>PlayerId</span>
  , _payload <span>::</span> a
  }
</pre>
</div>

<p>
With this, we can construct a value of type <code>Msg Quote</code> which represents the
<code>Quote</code> annotated by sender and recipient.
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>Msg</span>
  { _sender <span>=</span> <span>PlayerId</span> 2
  , _recipient <span>=</span> <span>PlayerId</span> 0
  , _payload <span>=</span> <span>Quote</span>
      { _proposal <span>=</span> undefined
      , _premium <span>=</span> 5
      , _share <span>=</span> 3
      }
  }
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Functions that only operate on the <code>_sender</code> and <code>_recipient</code> fields can be
written with the appropriate type signature and be generic over
payload.<label for="fn.1">1</label><span><sup>1</sup> This example uses object oriented style getters. If you’re
unfamiliar with optics/lenses, think of the operator <code>^.</code> as you would a regular
<code>.</code> to get a property from a value in a language like Python or C#.</span>
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>-- | Determines if a message is intended for player.</span>
<span>msg_for</span> <span>::</span> <span>Player</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Msg</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>msg_for</span> player msg <span>=</span>
  player<span>^.</span>name <span>==</span> msg<span>^.</span>recipient
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This function does not care what the payload of the message is; it can be used
on any list of messages, like
</p>

<div>
<pre>filter (msg_for broker) messages
</pre>
</div>

<p>
to extract a list of messages intended for that player, regardless of whether
the payload is <code>Quote</code> or anything else.<label for="fn.2">2</label><span><sup>2</sup> Though beginners with Haskell
beware: whenever we pass a list of messages into this funcion, it still needs to
be a homogeneous list of just one concrete type. We cannot mix both <code>Msg
Proposal</code> and <code>Msg Quote</code> in the same list.</span>
</p>

<p>
Even though <code>Msg</code> is a plain type constructor, it acts an awful lot like an
interface. That is the main point of this article; that’s a pattern that can be
used to design simple code.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
There is a common complaint against what we just did above. People say that
types-as-interfaces are not <i>composable</i>. Let’s find out what they mean. Imagine
we wanted some messages to be timestamped. We could add an optional <code>_timestamp</code>
field to the message type:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>-- | Create a message from any type a, with optional timestamp.</span>
<span>data</span> <span>MsgEtc</span> a <span>=</span> <span>MsgEtc</span>
  { _sender <span>::</span> <span>PlayerId</span>
  , _recipient <span>::</span> <span>PlayerId</span>
  , _timestamp <span>::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>UTCTime</span>
  , _payload <span>::</span> a
  }
</pre>
</div>

<p>
but what if we also wanted to timestamp some of the other objects we have, like
<code>Quote</code>? Aha! We just learned how to do this! We create a new wrapper type:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>-- | Annotate any value with a timestamp.</span>
<span>data</span> <span>Timestamped</span> a <span>=</span> <span>Timestamped</span>
  { _timestamp <span>::</span> <span>UTCTime</span>
  , _contents <span>::</span> a
  }
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Just as we before we can now tack on another layer of data and make a
<code>Timestamped (Msg Quote)</code>.
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>Timestamped</span>
  { _timestamp <span>=</span> now
  , _contents <span>=</span> <span>Msg</span>
      { _sender <span>=</span> <span>PlayerId</span> 2
      , _recipient <span>=</span> <span>PlayerId</span> 0
      , _payload <span>=</span> <span>Quote</span>
          { _proposal <span>=</span> undefined
          , _premium <span>=</span> 5
          , _share <span>=</span> 3
          }
      }
  }
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Clearly, this approach <i>does</i> compose, because we just composed both
<code>Timestamped a</code> and <code>Msg a</code>. But remember the <code>msg_for</code> function we had that
determined whether a message was intended for a particular recipient? It had the
signature
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>msg_for</span> <span>::</span> <span>Player</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Msg</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
meaning it takes any <code>Msg a</code> but it will not be possible to give it a
<code>Timestamped (Msg a)</code>; we have to unwrap the message from the timestamp first.
However, if we gave it an <code>Msg (Timestamped Quote)</code>, it would have worked,
perhaps counter-intuitively.
</p>

<p>
The complaint here is not that the approach does not compose at all (clearly it
does), but that it does not compose <i>well</i>: the order in which we choose to
annotate our data with extra fields affects whether or not we can pass them into
existing functions.
</p>

<p>
I think that’s basically fine. If we think about it, isn’t <code>Timestamped (Msg
Quote)</code> a different-feeling <i>thing</i> from a <code>Msg (Timestamped Quote)</code>? But let’s
assume we wanted to fix it. What is near at hand?
</p>

<hr>

<p>
We could make a typeclass
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>class</span> <span>HasRecipient</span> a <span>where</span>
  get_receiver <span>::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>PlayerId</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is more like a real interface, which can be implemented by any type that
has a receiver. Here are two implementations we would want:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>instance</span> <span>HasRecipient</span> (<span>Msg</span> a) <span>where</span>
  get_receiver msg <span>=</span> msg<span>^.</span>receiver

<span>instance</span> <span>HasRecipient</span> (<span>Timestamped</span> (<span>Msg</span> a)) <span>where</span>
  get_receiver tsd <span>=</span> tsd<span>^.</span>contents<span>.</span>receiver
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We could then rewrite <code>msg_for</code> in terms of this typeclass instead.
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>msg_for</span> <span>::</span> <span>HasRecipient</span> msg <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Player</span> <span>-&gt;</span> msg <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>msg_for</span> player msg <span>=</span>
  player<span>^.</span>name <span>==</span> get_receiver msg
</pre>
</div>

<p>
and this will work for any value of a type that implements <code>HasRecipient</code>,
including <code>Msg a</code> and <code>Timestamped (Msg a)</code>.
</p>

<p>
Okay, so let’s roll down this slippery slope. Maybe we have a function
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>logger</span> <span>::</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> [<span>Timestamped</span> a] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
which logs things in order of timestamp. This function will not take a list of
<code>Msg (Timestamped Quote)</code> because there the outer value is not timestamped but
the <code>Quote</code> inside.
</p>

<p>
We could apply our newly discovered hammer and create a similar <code>HasTimestamp</code> typeclass.
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>class</span> <span>HasTimestamp</span> a <span>where</span>
  get_timestamp <span>::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>UTCTime</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>HasTimestamp</span> (<span>Timestamped</span> a) <span>where</span>
  get_timestamp tsd <span>=</span> tsd<span>^.</span>timestamp

<span>instance</span> <span>HasRecipient</span> (<span>Msg</span> (<span>Timestamped</span> a)) <span>where</span>
  get_timestamp msg <span>=</span> msg<span>^.</span>payload<span>.</span>timestamp
</pre>
</div>

<p>
But at this point it gets a little confusing for this author’s brain – at least
if long-term maintenance is desired. What would be the best instance for
<code>Timestamped (Msg (Timestamped Quote))</code>, for example?
</p>

<p>
And as we said before, aren’t <code>Timestamped (Msg Quote)</code> and <code>Msg (Timestamped
Quote)</code> slightly different kinds of things? Do we <i>really</i> need to be able to
pass both unaltered into that logging function?
</p>

<hr>

<p>
What we really should do is take a cue from network protocol design. These are
robust things that have stood the test of time.
</p>

<p>
Image data might be stored in a <abbr>tga</abbr> file with headers giving information on
how to interpret it. It will be placed into a <abbr>http</abbr> request with its own headers.
This gets stuffed inside a <abbr>tcp</abbr> packet with further headers. That in turn is
enveloped in an <abbr>ip</abbr> datagram with headers. Which might then run along a wire
inside an ethernet frame, carrying – you guessed it – its own headers.
</p>

<p>
At no point during transmission<label for="fn.3">3</label><span><sup>3</sup> To be fair, I would not be surprised if it
was possible to find network switches in the wild that inspect <abbr>ip</abbr> headers, or
routers that look at <abbr>http</abbr> headers. So maybe that whole layered protocol thing
was a mistake and I’m full of crap!</span> does a switch hold up an ethernet frame to
the light and ask, “So what <abbr>http</abbr> content type are you transmitting?” We have
designed these protocols to be layered with meaningful structure from
outside to in. Maybe we can do that in our code as well.
</p>

<p>
Maybe we don’t need both <code>Timestamped (Msg Quote)</code> and <code>Msg (Timestamped Quote)</code>
in our application, and just one of them is enough. A mathematician creates
generalisations that work with everything. An engineer strips away the variants
that are less important and adapts the code to the big demands at hand. This
makes things simpler along the way.
</p>

<p>
If we do need both, maybe it’s fine to treat them as two different types (they
are!) and not try to make functions generic over them.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Author: Alexey Makhotkin <a href="mailto:squadette@gmail.com">squadette@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="introductiona-idintroductiona">Introduction<a id="introduction"></a></h2>
<p>In this database design tutorial <em>(~9000 words)</em> I’m going to show how to design the database tables for a real-world project of substantial complexity.</p>
<p>We’ll design a clone of Google Calendar.&nbsp; We will model as much as possible of the functionality that is directly related to the calendar.</p>
<p>This series illustrates an approach explained in the book called “Database Design using Minimal Modeling”, scheduled to be released in Summer 2024.&nbsp; Here is the website of the book: <a href="https://databasedesignbook.com/">https://databasedesignbook.com/</a>.&nbsp; You can leave your email address to receive occasional updates on the book and related materials.</p>
<p>We will first build a complete logical model that describes the calendar data to be stored.&nbsp; This should take most of the effort (~80% of text by word count). After the logical model is finished, we’ll build table design directly based on the logical model.</p>
<h2 id="intended-audiencea-idintended-audiencea">Intended audience<a id="intended-audience"></a></h2>
<p>The goal of the book is to help you get from a vague idea of what you need to implement (e.g.: “I need to build a website to manage schedule and instructor appointments for our gym”), to the full and complete definition of database tables.</p>
<p>The first three quarters of the text require only a general understanding of what databases are and how information is stored there.&nbsp; Parts 1-6 only talk about logical models, that do not depend on the specific database that you use (MySQL, Postgres, other classic relational servers, NoSQL solutions, cloud databases, etc.).&nbsp; So the majority of the text describes how the business requirements are modeled.</p>
<p>The last quarter of the text shows how to get from the logical model to physical tables structure.&nbsp; This part is absolutely not comprehensive, it only shows one of many possible approaches to the database table design.&nbsp; This approach, however, is perfectly valid for not very demanding systems.&nbsp; Also, many existing systems are designed in part using this strategy. &nbsp; This part of the text requires more familiarity with common databases: how the tables are created, what physical data types exist, what is primary key and index, how the tables would be queried, and how to insert and update data.</p>

<h2 id="approach-of-this-booka-idapproach-of-this-booka">Approach of this book<a id="approach-of-this-book"></a></h2>
<p>Often people start with designing the tables right away, but we take a different approach.&nbsp; This tutorial is aimed at people who are new to database design.&nbsp; The goal of the process is to answer several important questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Where to begin?&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to make sure that we did not miss anything?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how to ask for feedback on our database design;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how to fix design mistakes;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We begin with a logical model, written in a simple tabular format.&nbsp; We use short formalized sentences to define data attributes and relationships between entities.&nbsp; This helps us to make sure that our logical model aligns with the actual business requirements. &nbsp; Logical model is independent from a specific database implementation.</p>
<p>As the second step, when the logical model is decided, we design the physical tables.&nbsp; This process is very straightforward.&nbsp; For each element of the logical model there would be a corresponding table or column.&nbsp; Physical models can be as dependent on a specific database implementation as you need.</p>
<h2 id="problem-descriptiona-idproblem-descriptiona">Problem description<a id="problem-description"></a></h2>
<p>We’re going to implement a big part of Google Calendar functionality.&nbsp; Some parts we’ll skip, but we’ll try and implement every feature of calendaring.&nbsp; Some areas we’ll implement just enough to be able to discuss the more interesting parts.&nbsp; In the end you will be able to add missing functionality to the schema, going through the same process.</p>
<p>Google Calendar is a multi-user system.&nbsp; For example, users can share the events with other people.&nbsp; We’re going to implement only a bare minimum of user-related data.</p>
<p>Events are the central part of Google Calendar, and we’re going to design them as closely as possible to the real thing.&nbsp; Events have title and description, as well as some other minor attributes such as location.</p>
<p>The most complex part of calendar events is times and dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“All day” events vs time-based;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both can be repeated and non-repeated;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All day events:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can spread over multiple days;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time-based events:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can have associated time zone;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have begin and end time;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Begin and end time can happen on different days;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Begin and end time can be in different timezones;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both all-day and time based events:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can be repeated daily, or every N days;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be repeated weekly, on certain days of the week; again, it can be every two or more weeks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be repeated monthly, on a certain day or day of the week;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be repeated annually;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeating events can go on forever, until a certain date, or for a certain number of repetitions;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the repeating events, the specific instances can be moved to a different date/time.&nbsp; You can also delete some instances of the repeating events, for example, skipping a certain weekly meeting.</p>
<p>You can change the schedule of the repeated event, even if some of the events already happeneds.&nbsp; For example, you can switch from two project meetings every week on Tuesday and Thursday to one meeting every two weeks, on Fridays.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of a day event editing form:</p>
<p><img src="https://kb.databasedesignbook.com/posts/google-calendar-screenshot.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="part-1-basic-all-day-eventsa-idpart-1-basic-all-day-eventsa">Part 1: Basic all-day events<a id="part-1-basic-all-day-events"></a></h2>
<h3 id="anchorsa-idanchorsa">Anchors<a id="anchors"></a></h3>
<p>First thing we need is to find some so-called anchors.&nbsp; Anchors are also known as entities.&nbsp; Anchors are usually nouns, such as <em>User</em> and <em>Event</em>.</p>
<p>Anchors are something that can be counted.&nbsp; “<em>No users</em>”, “<em>one user</em>”, “<em>two users</em>”, etc.&nbsp; Also, one defining characteristic of an anchor is that it can be added: “adds a user record to the database”.</p>
<p>Anchors are extremely obvious in simple cases, but may get tricky in non-obvious cases.&nbsp; We’re going to write down even the most obvious anchors, to get some experience with handling them.</p>
<p>The first two anchors that come to mind are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Physical table</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>User</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>DayEvent</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Basically the only thing that anchors handle is IDs and counting.&nbsp; All the data is handled by attributes, discussed in the next section.</p>
<p>So, for example, in our database tables there would be a User with, say, ID=23, and DayEvent with ID=100, etc.</p>
<p>We won’t be dealing with the last column (“Physical table”) for now, we’ll discuss the physical model in the “Creating SQL Tables” section below.</p>
<p>To validate that we have an anchor, we can write a sentence using the name of this anchor.&nbsp; If this sentence makes sense, then this is an anchor.&nbsp; Example sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“<em>There are 200 Users in our database</em>”;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<em>When this form is submitted, a new User is added to the database</em>”;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Same for DayEvent:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“<em>There are 3000 DayEvents in our database</em>”;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<em>When this button is clicked, a new DayEvent is created</em>”;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Such sentences will be useful later in more complicated cases.</p>
<p>If the sentence does not make sense, then it may be an attribute:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“<em>There are 400 Prices in our database</em>” (???);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<em>When this form is submitted, a new Price is added to the database</em>” (???).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="attributes-of-usera-idattributes-of-usera">Attributes of User<a id="attributes-of-user"></a></h3>
<p>Attributes store the actual information about anchors.</p>
<p>Which data about users should we model?&nbsp; Users are ubiquitous, and different systems may want to store a lot of information about users.&nbsp; For this post, we’re going to model just the bare minimum of user data: emails.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Question</th>
<th>Logical type</th>
<th>Example value</th>
<th>Physical column</th>
<th>Physical type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>User</strong></td>
<td><strong>What is the email of this User?</strong></td>
<td><strong>string</strong></td>
<td><em>“cjdate@example.org”</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>What can we see here?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This attribute belongs to the User <strong>anchor</strong> that was defined in the previous section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We use <strong>questions</strong> to describe all sorts of attributes.&nbsp; Later on we’ll discuss why we prefer this style over “User’s email” and such;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logical type</strong> is quite simple.&nbsp; If you expected to see “<code>VARCHAR(128)</code>” here or something like that: no, we’ll discuss this much later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We show <strong>an example value</strong> that helps us to confirm our thinking.&nbsp; Again, in simple cases this is very obvious, but it would help reviewers to confirm that everyone is on the same page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We won’t be dealing with two last columns for now, we’ll discuss <strong>the physical model</strong> later in this post.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re going to see more examples of logical types later. We extensively discuss the logical types in the book.</p>
<p>Let’s skip ahead a little bit, and show how the table data about the users looks like.&nbsp; We’ll be using a simple strategy to design physical tables, so the result is going to be completely unsurprising:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Table <code>users</code></th>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>id</td>
<td>email</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><em>“cjdate@example.org”</em></td>
<td><em>…</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><em>“someone@else.com”</em></td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>…</td>
<td>…</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is just to show the part of the final result so that you know where we’re heading to.&nbsp; Here, a user with ID=2 has email “<em>cjdate@example.org</em>”, and a user with ID=3 has email “<em>someone@else.com</em>”.</p>
<p>Except for this, we won’t be talking much about the users here.</p>
<h3 id="attributes-of-dayeventa-idattributes-of-dayeventa">Attributes of DayEvent<a id="attributes-of-dayevent"></a></h3>
<p>Suppose that we want to schedule a two-day company retreat that begins on January 14th, 2024.&nbsp; In terms of anchors, this is going to be a DayEvent.</p>
<p>Looking at the paragraph above, we can see that we need to store the following data about the DayEvents:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Name of the event;</p>

<p>Let’s write that down in our table:</p>

<p>What can we see here?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We defined our first three attributes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don’t have any short names for the attributes, and this may bother us a little.&nbsp; We’d expect to have something like “<em>DayEvent_name</em>” or some other identification to refer to the attribute later in the text.&nbsp; We’ll return to this topic later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have a new logical type: date. We won’t need to deal with timezones in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For most events in actual calendars the begin date and end date would probably be the same (most events are single-day).&nbsp; We’ll just store the same date in both attributes.&nbsp; This allows us to treat the special case (single-day events) as the general case (multi-day events).&nbsp; This is a general design strategy, but we’re going to investigate later if this line of thinking is always applicable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="linksa-idlinksa">Links<a id="links"></a></h3>
<p>Where do we store the information that this particular user has created this particular DayEvent?&nbsp; At the first glance, this may look like an attribute of DayEvent, right?&nbsp; (Actually, no).</p>

</table>
<p>Attributes cannot contain IDs.&nbsp; Instead, when two anchors are involved, we need to use links.</p>
<table>
<thead>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Links help to pin down the correct design for many complicated scenarios.&nbsp; To describe the link, you need to write down two sentences.&nbsp; If the sentences don’t make sense or do not match the reality of the business — you’ve just prevented a design mistake!</p>
<p>What do we see in this table?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Link connects <strong>two anchors</strong>.&nbsp; Anchors could be different, like here, or the same. For example, “<em>Employee is a manager of Employee</em>” is one example of one such link.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To specify <strong>cardinality</strong>, we use a custom notation with the “<strong>&lt;</strong>” character (other possibilities are: “<strong>—</strong>”, “<strong>=</strong>”, and “<strong>&gt;</strong>”).&nbsp; It is the same as “1:N”, but additionally it allows you to specify which anchor is “<em>only one</em>” and which is “<em>several</em>”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We use <strong>two formalized sentences</strong> that involve two anchors, a verb, and information about cardinality.&nbsp; Those sentences allow us to validate and document our design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We write down the cardinality again, in a more familiar way in a separate column.&nbsp; Pinning down cardinality is essential, so we make a lot of fuss about it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(We’ll discuss the links much more, of course).</p>

<p>Again skipping ahead: if we would have stopped right now, and tried to write down the physical design for the schema that we have so far, here is what we’d see.&nbsp; This is just to confirm that we’re heading in a familiar direction.</p>

<p>We’ll discuss the physical model later in the “Creating SQL Tables” section.</p>
<h2 id="part-2-time-based-eventsa-idpart-2-time-based-eventsa">Part 2: Time-based events<a id="part-2-time-based-events"></a></h2>
<p>In the previous section, we discussed basic non-repeating date-based events.&nbsp; Let’s see how our modeling approach handles time-based events.</p>
<p>We modeled date-based events as the <em>DayEvent</em> anchor with the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>What is the name of this DayEvent?</em>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>When does the DayEvent begin?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>When does the DayEvent end?</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, we defined the link between User and DayEvent: “<em>User creates several DayEvents</em>”.</p>
<p>Let’s write down a quick draft of time-based events and see how it compares to date-based events.&nbsp; Quoting the “problem description” section:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Time-based events:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can have associated time zone;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have begin and end time;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Begin and end time can happen on different days;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Begin and end time can be in different timezones;”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-zonesa-idtime-zonesa">Time zones<a id="time-zones"></a></h3>
<p>Every country and territory uses one or more time zones. Time zone definitions occasionally change.&nbsp; Each country, being a sovereign state, can decide to change their time zone definition.</p>
<p>Time zones may use Daylight Savings Time, or can be uniform.&nbsp; New time zones may be introduced, or retired.&nbsp; In this text, we won’t go into complications of handling time zone definitions.&nbsp; If you were really implementing a serious global calendaring solution, you’d probably have a separate team dealing with such issues.</p>
<p>However, in this tutorial we will implement full timezone-aware events that are usable in practice.</p>
<p>We have one motivating example: <strong>plane tickets</strong>.&nbsp; Planes often cross time zone boundaries, and the take-off and landing times in your ticket would be in different time zones. Say, there is a flight from Amsterdam to London that departs on December 24, at 16:50 (Amsterdam time) and lands at 17:05 (London time).&nbsp; So, the flight duration is 1 hour 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Time zones inspire a lot of programming folklore.&nbsp; There are many blog posts, horror stories, “things every programmer should know” and other texts related to time zones, particularly in database context.&nbsp; Also, many systems keep breaking in various ways around the daylight switch time.&nbsp; We will discuss only as much as needed for our purposes, and briefly mention some important things to consider.</p>
<h3 id="anchorsa-idanchors-1a">Anchors<a id="anchors-1"></a></h3>
<p>Having said that, it seems that we need to add two anchors:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Physical table</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Timezone</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>TimeEvent</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There are dozens of time zones in the world. We can confirm the validity of the Timezone anchor by writing down example sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“<em>There are 120 Timezones in our database</em>”;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<em>When this import script finishes, a new Timezone is added to our database</em>”.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Timezone data structure is discussed below.)</p>
<p>The sentences for TimeEvent are also straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“<em>There are 2500 TimeEvents in our database</em>”;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<em>When this button is clicked, a new TimeEvent is created</em>”;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="attributes-of-timezonea-idattributes-of-timezonea">Attributes of Timezone<a id="attributes-of-timezone"></a></h3>
<p>For the purposes of this text, we’ll do only a very minimal model of Timezone.&nbsp; Basically, the only attribute we’d introduce is:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Question</th>
<th>Logical type</th>
<th>Example value</th>
<th>Physical column</th>
<th>Physical type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Timezone</strong></td>
<td><strong>What is the human-readable name of this Timezone?</strong></td>
<td><strong>string</strong></td>
<td><em>“Europe/Kyiv”</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We won’t go into details of how the timezone is actually defined.&nbsp; We assume that there is a complementary logical model that describes the structure of timezones.&nbsp; Also, we assume that there is some function that takes a local time in the specified timezone and returns UTC time (and vice-versa).&nbsp; This will be discussed in more detail in the next section, when we will talk about repeating events.</p>
<p>For clarity, here is what else would be included into a time zone definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is the UTC offset of this time zone?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does this time zone have Daylight Savings Time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When does DST begin?&nbsp; When does DST end?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the UTC offset when DST is on?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’d also need to model previous definitions of a time zone.&nbsp; For example, the government may decide to change the day when DST goes into force, or get rid of DST, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is this time zone active or retired?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an incomplete list.&nbsp; Modeling all of this data using our approach is possible, but is a separate, and quite technical exercise.</p>
<p>Let’s get back to events.</p>
<h3 id="attributes-of-timeeventa-idattributes-of-timeeventa">Attributes of TimeEvent<a id="attributes-of-timeevent"></a></h3>
<table>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that we’re using local time here.&nbsp; You may have read that time should be stored in UTC time (without any time zones), and then formatted for human readability using a preferred time zone.</p>
<p>Here we have a different situation.&nbsp; Time zones can change.&nbsp; Suppose that we scheduled a billiard game on September 6, 2058, from 09:30 to 11:00, Cologne time.&nbsp; At the moment we don’t know what UTC offset is going to be in that time zone at that time.&nbsp; So we must store the data exactly as entered by the user, and then adjust it as the local legislation changes.</p>
<h3 id="linksa-idlinks-1a">Links<a id="links-1"></a></h3>
<p>We have two very similar links here.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><sup>⚓</sup>Anchor<sub>1</sub>* <sup>⚓</sup>Anchor<sub>2</sub></th>
<th>Sentences (subject, verb, object, cardinality)</th>
<th>Cardinality (1:N, M:N, 1:1)</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Timezone &lt; TimeEvent</strong></td>
<td>Timezone is used for the <strong>start</strong> time of <em>many</em> TimeEvents TimeEvent uses <em>only one</em> Timezone for the <strong>start</strong> time</td>
<td><strong>1:N</strong></td>

<td><strong>User &lt; TimeEvent</strong></td>
<td>User creates <em>several</em> TimeEvents TimeEvent is created by <em>only one</em> User</td>
<td><strong>1:N</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The definitions of both links differ only in a single word (“start” vs “end”).</p>
<p>Most of the time-based events would have the same time zone for both start and end times.&nbsp; We design this as a general case: we always specify both, even if they are the same. This approach would help us to get used to handling more complicated cases.</p>
<h3 id="similarities-between-dateevent-and-timeeventa-idsimilarities-between-dateevent-and-timeeventa">Similarities between DateEvent and TimeEvent<a id="similarities-between-dateevent-and-timeevent"></a></h3>
<p>All-day events and time-based events look similar. Does it make sense to think about unification?</p>
<p>For example, both events have names.&nbsp; Also, how different are “date” and “date with time” from each other? We can also observe that both types of events would have more common data, such as “location”, list of invited guests, “description”, etc.&nbsp; Maybe we could extract that to some component shared between those two anchors?</p>
<p>Thankfully, logical modeling allows us to wait a little bit before making that decision.&nbsp; After all, it’s just simple tables that we can reshuffle before we commit to a physical table implementation.</p>
<p>For now, though, we want to gather more information on similarities (and, more important, dissimilarities) of two types of events that we’ve seen so far.&nbsp; Also, we want to see if there would be more types of events, and what attributes and links they have.</p>
<h2 id="part-3-repeated-all-day-eventsa-idpart-3-repeated-all-day-eventsa">Part 3. Repeated all-day events<a id="part-3-repeated-all-day-events"></a></h2>
<p>As we may remember from the initial problem description:</p>
<p><em>“Both all-day and time based events:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Can be repeated daily, or every N days;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Can be repeated weekly, on certain days of the week; again, it can be every two or more weeks;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Can be repeated monthly, on a certain day or day of the week;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Can be repeated annually;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Repeating events can go on either forever, or until a certain date, or for a certain number of repetitions;”</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section we’ll only talk about all-day events. Later we’ll see how the Minimal Modeling method handles commonalities between different anchors, in this case time-based events.&nbsp; Also, we’ll see how the logical schema gets changed: we would use this as an example of how the draft design is edited when a better design approach is introduced.&nbsp; Remember that all of this happens before we even start thinking about database tables, so this is a very smooth process: you don’t need to worry about table migrations yet.</p>
<p>If you think about the bullet points listed above, your reaction may be: “we probably need JSON for that”.&nbsp; That may well be true, but JSON belongs to the physical table design, so we won’t discuss this at this point.&nbsp; We’ll design everything that is needed on a logical level, and later on we’ll see what physical options we have.</p>
<h3 id="attribute-1-cadencea-idattribute-1-cadencea">Attribute #1, cadence<a id="attribute-1-cadence"></a></h3>
<p>So, let’s ask the first question, hoping that it would help us find an attribute: “<em>How often is that event repeated?</em>”&nbsp; Looking at event editing form we can see possible answers to that question: a) never; b) daily; c) weekly; d) monthly; e) annually.</p>
<p>We say that such attributes have an “either/or/or” type.&nbsp; Let’s write it down as an attribute.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Question</th>
<th>Logical type</th>
<th>Example value</th>
<th>Physical column</th>
<th>Physical type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>DayEvent</strong></td>
<td><strong>How often is that DayEvent repeated?</strong></td>
<td><strong>either/or/or</strong></td>
<td><em>daily weekly monthly annually</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For either/or/or attributes, we show the entire list of possible values in the “Example value” column.</p>
<p>What do we do with never-repeating events?&nbsp; On the logical level, <strong>an attribute can either be set to a specific value, or unset: this is a basic principle of minimal modeling</strong>.&nbsp; So if this attribute is not set then the event would be non-repeating.</p>
<h3 id="attribute-2-tangled-attributesa-idattribute-2-tangled-attributesa">Attribute #2, tangled attributes<a id="attribute-2-tangled-attributes"></a></h3>
<p>Reading further, we see that for all four frequencies, there is an additional possibility.&nbsp; The events can repeat every N days, N weeks, N months, and N years.&nbsp; Let’s write that down.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Question</th>
<th>Logical type</th>
<th>Example value</th>
<th>Physical column</th>
<th>Physical type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>DayEvent</strong></td>
<td><strong>For repeated events: what is the repetition step?</strong></td>
<td><strong>integer</strong></td>
<td><em>2 (every two days/weeks/etc)</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is our first example of <strong>tangled attributes</strong>.&nbsp; Its value only makes sense when another attribute is set.&nbsp; We specify that by adding “<em>For repeated events:</em> ” as part of the question.</p>
<p>Note that this is only a human-readable notation, we’re not going to discuss here how to write a machine-readable logical schema.</p>
<h3 id="attribute-3a-idattribute-3a">Attribute #3<a id="attribute-3"></a></h3>
<p>When you specify a monthly event, you have two options: repeat on the same day of the month (say, every 16th of the month), or repeat on the same weekday of the month as the original date (say, every second Tuesday).&nbsp; The base date is taken from the normal “When does the DayEvent begin?” attribute that was discussed in the beginning.</p>
<p>Let’s try and define this attribute:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Question</th>
<th>Logical type</th>
<th>Example value</th>
<th>Physical column</th>
<th>Physical type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>DayEvent</strong></td>
<td><strong>For monthly repeated events: which day of the month does it fall on?</strong></td>
<td><strong>either/or/or</strong></td>
<td><em>same_day</em><br><em>same_weekday</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="days-of-the-week-micro-anchorsa-iddays-of-the-week-micro-anchorsa">Days of the week: micro-anchors<a id="days-of-the-week-micro-anchors"></a></h3>
<p>Events can be repeated weekly, on certain days of the week.&nbsp; So, for example we can have a weekly event that happens on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.&nbsp; Where do we store this?</p>
<p>Let’s start with an attribute that may look like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Question</th>
<th>Logical type</th>
<th>Example value</th>
<th>Physical column</th>
<th>Physical type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>DayEvent</strong></td>
<td><strong>For weekly repeated events: which days of the week does it fall on?</strong></td>
<td><strong>Array of strings???</strong></td>
<td><em>[“Mon”, “Wed”, “Fri”] ???</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Would it work? Modern database systems such as Postgres and MySQL natively support storing arrays: Postgres has an array type, also they both have JSON type, so you can store an entire array in a single table column.&nbsp; Even though we discuss the logical level, this parallel can help to at least confirm the plausibility of this approach.&nbsp; Also, it’s entirely possible that we’ll decide to store that information in exactly this way, when we will discuss the physical table schema.</p>
<p>However, the approach taken by Minimal Modeling demands that we introduce a new anchor called <em>DayOfTheWeek</em>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Physical table</th>
<th>ID example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>DayOfTheWeek</strong></td>
<td></td>
<td>“Mon”, “Tue”, “Wed”, “Thu”, “Fri”, “Sat”, “Sun”</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is an example of a well-known anchor, similar to currencies, languages and countries.&nbsp; We discuss well-known anchors in <a href="https://minimalmodeling.substack.com/p/currencies-countries-and-languages">https://minimalmodeling.substack.com/p/currencies-countries-and-languages</a>.</p>
<p><em>DayOfTheWeek</em> may look a bit awkward because it is so tiny. There are only seven possible IDs here, and new ones will never be added. Also, the IDs are unusual because they are strings, and not the commonly used integer numbers. But introducing it helps keep the modeling approach simple.</p>
<p>You can also introduce attributes for this anchor, such as human-readable names of the days of the week.&nbsp; This is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<p>Now back to our task.&nbsp; We have two anchors: <em>DayEvent</em> and <em>DayOfTheWeek</em>.&nbsp; To connect them, we need a link.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><sup>⚓</sup>Anchor<sub>1</sub><br><strong>*</strong> <br><sup>⚓</sup>Anchor<sub>2</sub></th>
<th>Sentences (subject, verb, object, cardinality)</th>
<th>Cardinality (1:N, M:N, 1:1)</th>
<th>Physical table or column</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>DayEvent = DayOfTheWeek</strong></td>
<td>For weekly repeated DayEvents: DayEvent may happen on <em>several</em> DaysOfTheWeek DayOfTheWeek can contain <em>several</em> DayEvents</td>
<td><strong>M:N</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is a pretty normal link, but tangled, like the attributes we’ve seen above.&nbsp; This link only makes sense when it corresponds to the DayEvent that is repeated weekly.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="are-we-donea-idare-we-donea">Are we done?<a id="are-we-done"></a></h3>
<p>How can we make sure that we’re done with modeling?&nbsp; If we are not&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s revisit the original requirements again, and highlight the parts that we’ve covered so far:</p>
<p>“<em>Both</em> <strong><em>all-day</em></strong> <em>and time based events:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Can be repeated</em> <strong><em>daily</em></strong><em>, or</em> <strong><em>every N</em></strong> <em>days;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Can be repeated</em> <strong><em>weekly</em></strong><em>, on</em> <strong><em>certain days of the week</em></strong><em>; again, it can be</em> <strong><em>every two or more weeks</em></strong><em>;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Can be repeated</em> <strong><em>monthly</em></strong><em>, on a</em> <strong><em>certain day</em></strong> <em>or</em> <strong><em>day of the week</em></strong><em>;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Can be repeated</em> <strong><em>annually</em></strong><em>;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Repeating events can go on forever, until a certain date, or for a certain number of repetitions;"</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, we can now see that we forgot about the number of event repetitions.&nbsp; The corresponding part of requirements is not marked in any way. Let’s fix this.</p>
<h3 id="repeat-limit-more-tangled-attributesa-idrepeat-limit-more-tangled-attributesa">Repeat limit: more tangled attributes<a id="repeat-limit-more-tangled-attributes"></a></h3>
<p>“For how long do the periodic events repeat?” This looks like a plausible sentence to define the attribute.&nbsp; There are three possible answers: “forever”, “until a certain date”, and “for a certain number of reps”.</p>
<table>

<p>Now we can add two final missing pieces: which date, and how many repetitions.</p>

<p>We’re done.</p>
<p>Let’s quickly summarize the pieces of data that we defined here:</p>

<li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>attribute: How often is it repeated?</p>

<p>So far we’ve discussed the book-keeping part of the calendar. We have only one record for the entire series of events.&nbsp; Ten weekly project status meetings correspond to a <em>single</em> database record.&nbsp; Unlimited number of birthdays of our friend correspond to a <em>single</em> database record.</p>
<p>Let’s get back to the application that we’re working on: a calendar.&nbsp; We need to show a weekly view of the user’s calendar: say, seven days starting from 26th of Feb up to 3rd of Mar.&nbsp; Which events do we need to show on that page?&nbsp; Say, there is one of the weekly project status meetings (out of ten) happening that week. If the birthday (annual event) falls on that week we need to show it.</p>
<p>So, we need to write some sort of SQL query that looks like this pseudo-code:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT …
FROM …
WHERE &lt;date&gt; BETWEEN ‘2024-02-26’ AND ‘2024-03-26’;
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe this would even be several SQL queries, or even some code in a programming language.&nbsp; The data structure that we’ve considered so far is quite complicated.&nbsp; To find the events that must be shown on a certain week, you need to take a lot into account. This may quickly become impractical.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-on-tempoa-ida-note-on-tempoa">A note on tempo<a id="a-note-on-tempo"></a></h3>
<p>I’ve been writing this chapter in the course of a few months.&nbsp; I’ve been thinking about this problem a lot.&nbsp; I have a quite clear understanding of the end state that I have in mind,&nbsp; I just need to write it down.</p>
<p>But if I were to present to you the complete table design right now, it wouldn’t be useful for our goal: to learn database design.&nbsp; You won’t understand why I made certain decisions.</p>
<p>At the same time, I don’t want to present very small incremental changes, so that text is not too long.&nbsp; So we need to find some middle ground.</p>
<p>We started this section with a question of how to render a weekly page.&nbsp; Let’s remember another requirement that our calendar application definitely has: <strong>changing and canceling some events from the series</strong>. Say, you have ten weekly project meetings, but you want to cancel one of them because the weather is very good. The existing book-keeping part of our database model won’t change.&nbsp; But we need to add some anchors, attributes and links for the second half: rendering and modification.</p>
<h3 id="general-ideaa-idgeneral-ideaa">General idea<a id="general-idea"></a></h3>
<p>We want to introduce a new anchor that would store the information about <em>each event in the series</em>.&nbsp; So, if we have 10 weekly project status meetings, we’re going to have ten rows in some table.&nbsp; Each record would correspond to a specific date (e.g., <em>2024-02-12</em>, <em>2024-02-19</em>, etc.).</p>
<p>First, this would make our rendering very simple.&nbsp; You have a very easy way to find all the events that fall on a specific day.</p>
<p>Second, this would allow us to reschedule and cancel some events in the series.&nbsp; If we have a project meeting at 12:00 normally, but on a certain week we want to move it to 14:00 (or even to a different day), we can do that. Data in the original book-keeping anchor, TimeEvent, that we defined previously, won’t change.</p>
<p>Also, if we just want to skip one project status meeting, we can mark this particular day as skipped.</p>
<h3 id="day-slotsa-idday-slotsa">Day slots<a id="day-slots"></a></h3>
<p>First, we have to find a name for those things.&nbsp; In some cases this may be a challenge.&nbsp; Just five minutes ago, having another cup of tea, I realized that a good word for this thing is “slot”.</p>
<p>Also, like before, we’re going to treat per-day and time-based events differently.&nbsp; So, we’re going to have <em>DaySlot</em> and <em>TimeSlot</em> anchors.&nbsp; Let’s discuss per-day slots first.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Physical table</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>DaySlot</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><em>DaySlot</em> needs a surprisingly small number of attributes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Question</th>
<th>Logical type</th>
<th>Example value</th>
<th>Physical column</th>
<th>Physical type</th>

<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>DaySlot</strong></td>
<td><strong>Is this DaySlot skipped?</strong></td>
<td><strong>yes/no</strong></td>
<td><em>yes</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that the user can change the date for a specific slot!&nbsp; So, we see that this requirement is handled cleanly.</p>
<p>Also, we need to establish a link between DaySlot and the corresponding DayEvent.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>

<td><strong>DayEvent &lt; DaySlot</strong></td>
<td>DayEvent may generate <em>several</em> DaySlots DaySlot corresponds to <em>only one</em> DayEvent</td>
<td><strong>1:N</strong></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Some things to note: first, <strong>we always create a DaySlot for every DayEvent, even for non-repeating ones</strong>.&nbsp; This is needed to simplify the rendering code.</p>
<p>Second, we have an interesting <strong>problem with “infinite” events</strong>.&nbsp; Suppose that we added our friend’s birthday to the calendar, repeating annually.&nbsp; How many corresponding DaySlots do we need to create?&nbsp; One possible solution would be to choose some arbitrary limit such as 100 years in the future, and create all the slots for that.&nbsp; Other solutions are possible, such as on-demand creation when user requests to show a calendar page in some distant future.</p>
<p>Third, if you think about this, it’s possible that more information could also be <strong>different for each slot</strong>.&nbsp; For example, it’s possible that some meetings will take place in different locations.&nbsp; Also, the guest list may change: you can invite extra people to a certain meeting.&nbsp; Also, the attendance would certainly be different.&nbsp; We won’t cover those aspects here, because modeling this it’s pretty straightforward: just add more links that connect DaySlot with other anchors.</p>
<p>Also, one thing to consider is that <strong>date arithmetics needs a bit of care</strong>.&nbsp; How do we deal with birthdays of people who were born on February 29?&nbsp; We will have to decide something.&nbsp; Maybe we’ll prohibit the user from creating such events?&nbsp; Maybe we’ll ask them where to move the slot: day earlier or day later?&nbsp; Similar problem also exists for monthly events that happen on the 31st day of the month.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-timeslotsa-idexercise-timeslotsa">Exercise: TimeSlots<a id="exercise-timeslots"></a></h3>
<p>Here is an exercise for the determined reader.&nbsp; Think about how you would model the <em>TimeSlot</em> anchor, its attributes and links.&nbsp; Fill in the tables with anchors, links and attributes, using the format explained above.&nbsp; Think about what role would time zones play.</p>
<h3 id="how-far-ahead-do-you-need-to-thinka-idhow-far-ahead-do-you-need-to-thinka">How far ahead do you need to think?<a id="how-far-ahead-do-you-need-to-think"></a></h3>
<p>Sometimes you can create a better design if you consider a slightly broader set of requirements.&nbsp; We did it in this chapter: we started thinking about rendering the page, but then we also considered the need to modify some events in the series.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can create a better design if you consider requirements independently.&nbsp; In the previous chapters, we looked at time-based and per-day events, and decided to handle them separately for now.</p>
<p>So far we did not even mention any hypothetical future requirements.&nbsp; We’ve only been designing stuff that we know is needed.&nbsp; Can we think up something that would be nice to have in the future, and design ahead? If you only include known requirements, there is a chance of overfitting design for known data points.</p>
<p>At the same time, people sometimes introduce considerations that never actually materialize.&nbsp; In this case design may introduce extra complexity that is not needed for the actual requirements, adding a bit of friction.</p>
<p>There is always a chance of leaning towards one of those traps, or even falling into them.</p>
<p>Logical design based on Minimal Modeling insists on modeling only the parts that we actually know are needed.&nbsp; We can afford that because Minimal Modeling treats changing requirements as a given.&nbsp; Also, Minimal Modeling discourages you from adding more abstract concepts, and this is intentional.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss this aspect of physical design later in the book. We’ll introduce the concept of Game of Tables, and the idea of Date’s Demon.</p>

<p>For repeated time-based events, we choose the same approach as with all-day events.&nbsp; We’re going to introduce an anchor called “<em>TimeSlot</em>”.&nbsp; <em>TimeSlot</em> corresponds to a specific event on a specific date and time.&nbsp; A repeated event corresponds to several <em>TimeSlots</em>.</p>
<p>Time slots can be rescheduled or canceled manually, just like all-day slots.</p>
<p>Here is an anchor:</p>
<table>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>A specific time slot can generally be moved even to a different day, so we have to keep this information also.&nbsp; Which time zone shall we use for the begin/end time?&nbsp; As you may remember from Part 2, in Google Calendar you can have different time zones for begin and end time.&nbsp; If you think about that, it makes sense to keep it for the time slots also.</p>

<p>Also, we need to connect TimeSlots with TimeEvents, same as we did with DaySlots/DayEvents:</p>

<p>Same as with <em>DaySlot</em>, we would create a <em>TimeSlot</em> even for non-repeated TimeEvents.</p>

<p>Finally, here is a diagram that shows all anchors and links (but not attributes):</p>

<h2 id="part-7-creating-sql-tablesa-idpart-7-creating-sql-tablesa">Part 7. Creating SQL tables<a id="part-7-creating-sql-tables"></a></h2>
<p>In the previous chapters we defined the complete logical model, so most of the work is actually already done. The rest is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>For teaching purposes we’re going to use one specific table design strategy: “one table per anchor”.&nbsp; It is one of the most common approaches to physical table design. There are several more possible strategies, we’re going to discuss them in a book.</p>
<p>We have 7 anchors, 21 attributes and 10 links so far.&nbsp; Given that we use “one table per anchor” strategy, we’re going to have 7 + 2 = 9 tables (number of anchors + number of M:N links), and 21 + 8 = 29 columns in total (number of attributes + number of 1:N links).</p>
<p>If our logical design correctly describes the business requirements then the tables will be automatically correct.&nbsp; We’ll talk about evolving requirements in the book.&nbsp; Also, we’ll discuss design mistakes and how to fix them.</p>
<p>We’re going to revisit the tables from the previous section, and fill in our choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For anchors, fill in “Physical table” columns;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each attribute, fill in “Physical column”, and choose the “Physical type”;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each M:N link, choose the name of the physical table;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each 1:N link, fill in the column name in the table that corresponds to the N-side anchor;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="anchors-choose-names-for-tablesa-idanchors-choose-names-for-tablesa">Anchors: choose names for tables<a id="anchors-choose-names-for-tables"></a></h3>
<p>Here we just choose a straightforward plural name for each table.</p>

<p>Some companies or applications enforce different naming conventions (singular, camel case, etc.).&nbsp; In that case, you would just use the names that comply with the convention.</p>
<h3 id="attributes-choose-the-column-name-and-physical-typea-idattributes-choose-the-column-name-and-physical-typea">Attributes: choose the column name and physical type<a id="attributes-choose-the-column-name-and-physical-type"></a></h3>
<p>For the <strong>physical column name</strong>, we choose some sensible name.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>day_events.end_date</code> would be the column name for the “When does the DayEvent begin?” attribute;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>​​<code>time_slots.is_skipped </code>would be the column name for the “Is this TimeSlot skipped?” attribute</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on.&nbsp; Due to the way relational databases work, you have to choose a very short name.&nbsp; In many cases this name by itself is not enough to fully explain the meaning of the data.&nbsp; That’s one of the reasons why we begin with the logical schema, and use longer human-readable questions to define the semantics of the attributes.</p>
<p>For the <strong>physical type</strong>, we choose a sensible type without much discussion.&nbsp; This topic is covered extensively in the book. There is also a list of recommended data types for each logical type in the book, and we just use that directly.</p>
<p>If you’re working with an existing system, you may be required to choose an alternative physical data type for the column.&nbsp; For example, your database server may support a better suited data type; or there could be some engineering guidelines that make you choose a different data type.</p>
<p>We’re going to discuss this variance in the book.&nbsp; However, full discussion of all physical design concerns is well outside of the scope of <em>any</em> book.&nbsp; This is the stuff that you spend your career on learning, and it changes as new technologies emerge.</p>

<p>For this problem, we’ve used around half of logical attribute types:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>string: 4 attributes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>date: 4 attributes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>either/or/or: 3 attributes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>integer: 2 attributes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>date/time (local): 4 attributes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yes/no: 2 attributes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see that the physical definitions of attributes of the same logical type are almost the same.&nbsp; The only differences are: a) maximum length of strings; and b) <code>NULL</code> vs <code>NOT NULL</code>.</p>
<p>We choose “<code>NOT NULL</code>” for attributes where the value always needs to be there due to business requirements.&nbsp; For example, the name of the event, or the start date of the all-day event.&nbsp; For tangled attributes, we choose nullable physical types (“<code>NULL</code>”).&nbsp; We discuss nullability in the book, but note that “NULL” only exists in the physical schema.</p>
<p>Just as NULLs, so-called “sentinel values” also do not exist in logical modeling.</p>
<h3 id="1n-linksa-id1n-linksa">1:N Links<a id="1n-links"></a></h3>
<p>For 1:N links, we add a column to the N-side anchor table.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><sup>⚓</sup>Anchor<sub>1</sub><br>* <br><sup>⚓</sup>Anchor<sub>2</sub></th>
<th>Sentences (subject, verb, object, cardinality)</th>
<th>Cardinality (1:N, M:N, 1:1)</th>
<th>Physical table or column</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>User &lt; DayEvent</strong></td>
<td>User creates <em>many</em> DayEvents DayEvent is created by <em>only one</em> User</td>
<td><strong>1:N</strong></td>
<td><code>day_events.user_id</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>DayEvent &lt; DaySlot</strong></td>
<td>DayEvent may generate <em>several</em> DaySlots DaySlot corresponds to <em>only one</em> DayEvent</td>
<td><strong>1:N</strong></td>
<td><code>day_slots.day_event_id</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Choosing the column name is usually quite easy.&nbsp; The only complication could be when there are two and more different links between the same two anchors.&nbsp; We have that situation with the timezones, and we’ll use two different columns.</p>
<h3 id="mn-linksa-idmn-linksa">M:N links<a id="mn-links"></a></h3>
<p>For M:N links we must use a separate table for each link.&nbsp; Every such table will have almost identical structure, only the column names would be different.</p>
<p>We only need to find a good name for such a table.&nbsp; There is no naming method that works in all cases, you will have to try some combinations, looking for readability.&nbsp; For links this is especially difficult because it’s not clear which of the two anchors is more important and should come first.</p>
<p>Same as with attributes, due to the way relational databases work, the name of the table needs to be quite short.&nbsp; In many cases the name by itself is not enough to fully explain the meaning of the data.&nbsp; That’s one of the reasons why we prepare logical schema, and use human-readable sentences to define the semantics of the links.</p>
<p>Anyway, here is the full table of links with the names chosen for the tables and columns (see the last column).</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><sup>⚓</sup>Anchor<sub>1</sub><br>* <br><sup>⚓</sup>Anchor<sub>2</sub></th>

<p>As we mentioned in the previous section, we’re going to have 8 (eight) SQL tables: 6 for anchors and 2 for M:N links.&nbsp; One anchor (<em>DayOfTheWeek</em>) is special, so we don’t create a physical table for that.&nbsp; We use a very common approach to designing physical tables.&nbsp; Other approaches are also possible, but this discussion is outside the scope of this post.&nbsp; So, let’s just write down all the tables, and add all the attributes that we have.</p>
<p>This is a very straightforward and even boring process at this point.</p>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE users (
&nbsp;&nbsp;id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
&nbsp;&nbsp;email VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE timezones (
&nbsp;&nbsp;id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
&nbsp;&nbsp;name VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE day_events (
&nbsp;&nbsp;id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
&nbsp;&nbsp;user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;name VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;begin_date DATE NOT NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;end_date DATE NOT NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;repeated VARCHAR(24) NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;repetition_step INTEGER NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;repeated_monthly_on VARCHAR(24) NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;repeated_until VARCHAR(24) NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;repeated_until_date VARCHAR(24) NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;repeated_reps INTEGER NULL
);

CREATE TABLE time_events (
&nbsp;&nbsp;id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
&nbsp;&nbsp;user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;start_timezone_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;end_timezone_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;name VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;begin_local_time DATETIME NOT NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;end_local_time DATETIME NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE day_slots (
&nbsp;&nbsp;id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
&nbsp;&nbsp;day_event_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;the_date DATE NOT NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;is_skipped TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE TABLE time_slots (
&nbsp;&nbsp;id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
&nbsp;&nbsp;time_event_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;begin_local_time DATETIME NOT NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;end_local_time DATETIME NOT NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;start_timezone_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;end_timezone_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;is_skipped TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE TABLE day_event_dows (
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day_event_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day_of_week VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRIMARY KEY (day_event_id, day_of_week),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KEY (day_of_week)
);

CREATE TABLE time_event_dows (
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time_event_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day_of_week VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRIMARY KEY (time_event_id, day_of_week),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KEY (day_of_week)
);
</code></pre>
<p>Is that really it?&nbsp; Mostly, yes. Though we need to talk a bit about indexes and about the attributes that we’ve skipped for brevity.</p>
<p>Most experienced database developers would look at the schema above and immediately notice that some “obvious” indexes are missing.&nbsp; For example, <code>day_events.user_id</code> must certainly be indexed.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there is no hard and fast rule on what columns (and combinations of columns) need to be indexed.&nbsp; That depends on how the tables are going to be queried by the application.&nbsp; The best book about database indexes is called “Use The Index, Luke” (<a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/">https://use-the-index-luke.com/</a>).&nbsp; Go read it.&nbsp; We&nbsp; will also discuss indexes in a bit more detail in the book.</p>
<p>When we were talking about logical schema (especially in the beginning), we skipped some of the attributes, because they were very much similar to other attributes. For example, we would probably want to add the name of the user, and the column that stores the user’s password hash.&nbsp; Some of the data elements just don’t add anything new to this text, for example the event location, or the list of invited guests.&nbsp; As an exercise, you could go ahead and add the elements that we did not discuss, the ones that you’re interested in.&nbsp; Add a few rows to the catalog tables, fill in the contents of each cell, and then edit the schema definition above to include the missing pieces of data.</p>
<h2 id="conclusiona-idconclusiona">Conclusion<a id="conclusion"></a></h2>
<p>Here is a short summary of the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>start with a free-form text that describes the business problem you’re working on;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>write down the list of anchors, as explained above;&nbsp; use any collaborative tool, such as Google Docs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>write down the list of attributes, as explained above, pay particular attention to the questions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>write down the list of links, as explained above, pay particular attention to the sentences, because they help you make sure that you get cardinality right;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>create a graphical schema based on the logical model, if visual representation helps you think;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fill in the physical model: table names, column names, physical data types;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>write down the SQL schema as a series of CREATE TABLE operators, using information from the previous step;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>submit the schema to your database server, fix typos, re-submit;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>share the logical model with your team;</p>

      <p>The key to curing male pattern baldness - a condition that affects up to 50 per cent of men worldwide - could lie in a sugar that naturally occurs in the human body, according to scientists at the University of Sheffield.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>The key to curing male pattern baldness - a condition that affects up to 50 per cent of men worldwide - could lie in a sugar that naturally occurs in the human body, according to scientists at the University of Sheffield.</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">In a study published in the journal&nbsp;Frontiers in Pharmacology, researchers have discovered that a sugar called 2-deoxy-D-ribose (2dDR), which plays a fundamental role in various biological processes both in animals and humans, can stimulate hair to regrow in mice.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Over the past eight years, scientists from Sheffield and COMSATS University Pakistan have been studying how the sugar can help to heal wounds by promoting the formation of new blood vessels. During the research, the team also noticed that hair around the healing wounds appeared to grow more quickly compared to those that hadn’t been treated.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">To explore this further, the scientists established a model of testosterone driven hair loss in mice - similar to the cause of pattern baldness in men. The team found that applying a small dose of the naturally occurring sugar helped to form new blood vessels, which led to hair regrowing.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Findings from the study show that the deoxy ribose sugar is as effective at regrowing hair as Minoxidil - an existing drug used to treat hair loss. However, the research offers a potential alternative approach to stimulating hair growth through a naturally occurring deoxy ribose sugar.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Professor Sheila MacNeil, Emeritus Professor of Tissue Engineering at the University of Sheffield, said:</strong>&nbsp;“Male pattern baldness is such a common condition, affecting men all over the world, but at the moment there are only two FDA licensed drugs to treat it. Our research suggests that the answer to treating hair loss might be as simple as using a naturally occurring deoxy ribose sugar to boost the blood supply to the hair follicles to encourage hair growth.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“The research we have done is very much early stage, but the results are promising and warrant further investigation. This could offer another approach to treating this condition which can affect men’s self-image and confidence.”</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Professor (Associate) Muhammed Yar (T.I.) of IRCBM, COMSATS University Pakistan, said:</strong> “This pro-angiogenic deoxy ribose sugar is naturally occurring, inexpensive and stable and we have shown it can be delivered from a variety of carrier gels or dressings. This makes it an attractive candidate to explore further for treatment of hair loss in men.”</p>

            <p>Digital audio processing is a complex yet fascinating subject. Linux, known for its robust and flexible system architecture, runs a sophisticated audio stack that can be particularly daunting to understand. Grasping it properly requires knowledge in multiple technical disciplines, including physics, electrical/electronical engineering, and software engineering specific to the Linux ecosystem. This article aims to demystify the Linux audio stack by explaining the basics of sound, how humans perceive sound, and the workings of digital audio. We will then delve into the components that make up the Linux audio system and explore how these interact. Buckle up; it’s going to be a long and informative read.</p>
            <h2 id="Exclaimer"><a href="#Exclaimer" title="Exclaimer"></a>Exclaimer</h2>
            <p>In this article, I will simplify concepts and ideas to provide you with the basic knowledge needed to follow along. Each chapter could easily be expanded into a dedicated, lengthy blog post. However, for simplicity’s sake, I have refrained from doing so. If you would like further details about a specific chapter, please feel free to contact me or leave a comment. I’ll be happy to delve into more detail if needed.</p>
            <h2 id="Understanding-Sound-and-Sound-Waves"><a href="#Understanding-Sound-and-Sound-Waves" title="Understanding Sound and Sound Waves"></a>Understanding Sound and Sound Waves</h2>
            <p>Before delving into the technicalities of audio processing, it’s essential to understand what sound is. In a nutshell, sound is a vibration that propagates as an acoustic wave through a medium such as air. These waves are created by vibrating objects (such as speakers, headphones, piezo buzzers, etc.), causing fluctuations in air pressure that our ears can pick up and perceive as sound. Audio waves can have many shapes, the most common waveform is the sine wave. It is the fundamental building block for all other waves existing, and thus it’s important to learn about the sine wave first.</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.rtrace.io/images/linux-audio-stack-demystified/sine-wave-fundamentals.svg" alt="Sine-Wave Fundamentals"></p>
            <p>All waveforms have 2 fundamental key properties:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>Period (duration)</code>: The time it takes the wave to perform a single oscillation.</li>
              <li><code>Amplitude</code>: This represents the wave’s strength or intensity, which we perceive as volume. Higher amplitudes generally correspond to louder sounds.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We can derive the <code>Frequency</code> from the period duration of a wave form. The frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz), and it represents the number of oscillations (waves) per second. Higher frequencies correspond to higher-pitched sounds. In other words, the shorter the period duration, the higher the pitch. The higher the frequency the higher the pitch. Thus, the frequency is the inverse of the period duration, or in mathematical terms:</p>
            <p><code>f = 1 / (period duration[s]) = (period duration[s])⁻¹</code>.</p>
            <p>Amplitudes can be measured as the pressure variation in the air - the so called Sound Pressure Level (SPL). The standard unit for pressure is Pascal (Pa). In audio contexts, we often deal with very small pressures, so micropascals (µPa) are typically used. However, the most common way of describing amplitude is Decibels (dB). Decibels are a logarithmic unit used to describe the ratio of a particular sound level to a given reference level. Decibels are the preferred unit, because the human ear perceives sound pressure levels logarithmically. </p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>dB SPL</code>: Sound pressure level in decibels. In air, the reference pressure is typically 20 µPa (typically referred to as <code>P0</code>), the threshold of human hearing. It is calculated using the formula <code>SPL = 20 * log₁₀(P/P0)</code>, where <code>P</code> is the measured pressure and <code>P0</code>​ is the reference pressure (20 µPa). </li>
              <li><code>dBV</code> and <code>dBu</code>: When sound is converted into an electrical signal by a microphone, the amplitude can be measured in volts (V). This is common in audio equipment and recording. <code>dBV</code> and <code>dBU</code> are units for voltage measurements in audio systems, referencing 1 volt for dBV or 0.775 volts for dBu. Similarily to <code>db SPL</code>, <code>dbV and dBu</code> can be calculated using the same formula, just exchange the reference pressure with a reference voltage. dBV = 20 * log₁₀(V/V0)<code>, where </code>V<code>is the measured voltage and</code>V0`​ is the reference voltage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You might wonder how a sine wave actually sounds like? Here’s an example of a sine wave at a frequency of 440 Hz. Please check your volume before you play!</p>
            
            <h2 id="How-humans-process-sound-waves"><a href="#How-humans-process-sound-waves" title="How humans process sound waves"></a>How humans process sound waves</h2>
            <p>Sound waves are captured by the <code>pinna</code>, the visible part of the outer ear. The pinna helps direct sound waves into the ear canal. The sound waves travel through the ear canal and reach the eardrum (tympanic membrane). The sound waves cause the eardrum to vibrate (very similar to sound waves bring microphone membranes to vibrate). These vibrations correspond to the frequency and amplitude of the incoming sound waves. The vibrations from the eardrum are transmitted to the three tiny bones in the middle ear, known as the ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes). The ossicles amplify the vibrations and transmit them to the oval window, a membrane-covered opening to the inner ear. The vibrations pass through the oval window and enter the cochlea, a spiral-shaped, fluid-filled structure in the inner ear. Inside the cochlea, the vibrations create waves in the cochlear fluid, causing the basilar membrane to move. The movement of the basilar membrane stimulates tiny hair cells located on it. These hair cells convert mechanical vibrations into electrical signals through a process called transduction. Different frequencies of sound stimulate different parts of the basilar membrane, allowing the ear to distinguish between various pitches. The hair cells release neurotransmitters in response to their movement, which generates electrical impulses in the auditory nerve. These electrical signals travel along the auditory nerve to the brain. The auditory signals reach the auditory cortex in the brain, where they are processed and interpreted as recognizable sounds, such as speech, music, or noise.</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.rtrace.io/images/linux-audio-stack-demystified/human-ear-anatomy.png" alt="Anatomy of the human ear"></p>
            <p>Hard facts to better understand the dimensions of sound waves:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The typical frequency range of human hearing is from ~20 Hz to ~20.000 Hz (20 kHz). This range can vary with age and exposure to loud sounds.</li>
              <li>The frequency of humans speaking typically falls within the range of ~300 Hz to ~3.400 Hz (3.4 kHz).</li>
              <li>Human ears are most sensitive to frequencies between 2,000 Hz and 5,000 Hz.</li>
              <li>The quietest sound that the average human ear can hear is around 0 dB SPL (sound pressure level), equivalent to 20 micropascals.</li>
              <li>The loudest sound that the average human ear can tolerate without pain is around 120-130 dB SPL. Sounds above this level can cause immediate hearing damage.</li>
              <li>The range between the threshold of hearing and the threshold of pain is known as the dynamic range of human hearing, which is approximately 120 dB.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="How-Digital-Audio-Works"><a href="#How-Digital-Audio-Works" title="How Digital Audio Works"></a>How Digital Audio Works</h2>
            <p>Now, that we got a rudimentary understanding of sound waves in the analog world work, let’s continue with sound waves in a world of zeroes and ones.<br>When we talk about audio in a digital context, we’re referring to sound that’s been captured, processed, and played back using computers.</p>
            <h3 id="Audio-Input-and-Sampling"><a href="#Audio-Input-and-Sampling" title="Audio-Input and Sampling"></a>Audio-Input and Sampling</h3>
            <p>Sampling to computers is what hearing is to humans. Sampling is the process of converting analog sound waves into digital data that a computer can process. This is done by taking regular measurements of the amplitude of the sound wave at fixed intervals. The rate at which these samples are taken is called the sampling rate and is measured in samples per second (Hz). Common sampling rates include 44.1 kHz (CD quality) and 48 kHz (professional audio).</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.rtrace.io/images/linux-audio-stack-demystified/sine-wave-sampling.svg" alt="Sampling rate on a sine wave"></p>
            <p>Each lollipop on the sine wave represents a single discrete sample/measurmeent. The first oscillation has a higher sample rate, the second oscillation has a lower sample rate for demonstration purposes only. Typically, the sample rate is constant, and more than double of the highest frequency humans can hear.</p>
            <h4 id="Nyquist-Shannon"><a href="#Nyquist-Shannon" title="Nyquist-Shannon"></a>Nyquist-Shannon</h4>
            <p>The Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem is a fundamental principle in the field of digital signal processing. It provides a criterion for determining the minimum sampling rate that allows a continuous signal to be perfectly reconstructed from its samples. A continuous-time signal that has been bandlimited to a maximum frequency fmax (meaning it contains no frequency components higher than fmax​) can be completely and perfectly reconstructed from its samples if the sampling rate fs is greater than twice the maximum frequency of the signal.</p>
            <p>Mathematically, this can be expressed as: <code>fs &gt; 2 * fmax</code></p>
            <p>This nicely explains why common sampling rate are typically a little bit more than double of the human hearing range (e.g. 44.1 kHz for CD quality).</p>
            <h4 id="Quantization"><a href="#Quantization" title="Quantization"></a>Quantization</h4>
            <p>In the analog world, signals have infinite precision. For example, if you zoom in on a sine wave, you can always find more detail — the waveform continues to be smooth and precise no matter how closely you examine it. However, in the digital world, precision is limited. To understand this limitation, consider this question: “How many numbers can you represent between 0 and 1?” If you use 0.1 as the smallest possible increment value, you can only represent 10 discrete values between 0 and 1. If you refine the smallest increment to 0.01, you get 100 values between 0 and 1. In the analog realm, there’s no smallest possible increment; values can be infinitely precise. But in digital systems, precision is constrained by the number of bits used to represent the signal. Digital audio uses a fixed number of bits to encode each sample of sound. For instance, in a common 16-bit audio system, there are 65,536 discrete levels available to represent the amplitude of each sample. This means that the smallest difference between two levels, or the smallest possible increment, is approximately 0.000030518.</p>
            <p>The process of approximating each sample’s amplitude to the nearest value within these discrete levels is known as quantization. The number of discrete levels depends on the bit depth of the audio. For example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>16-bit audio provides 65.536 possible amplitude values.</li>
              <li>24-bit audio offers 16.777.216 possible amplitude values.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Quantization is essential because it allows us to represent analog signals with a finite number of discrete values, making digital storage and processing feasible, even though we sacrifice some level of precision compared to the analog world. For all the audiophiles reading this: 24-bit resolution is enough! No, you don’t hear the difference between analog signals and 24-bit digital signals.</p>
            <h4 id="Storing-Digital-Audio-signals"><a href="#Storing-Digital-Audio-signals" title="Storing Digital Audio signals?"></a>Storing Digital Audio signals?</h4>
            <p>With an understanding of sampling and quantization, we can now explore how digital audio can be stored. For illustrative purposes, let’s consider designing a basic audio format to store digital audio, using the simplicity of the CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format as our foundation. Although this proposed format would be inefficient compared to established audio formats like MP3, WAV, or FLAC, it serves as a useful exercise in understanding the principles behind audio file storage. CSV files are a familiar format for many, used to store tabular data in a straightforward, readable manner. They consist of rows and columns separated by commas, making them an ideal starting point for conceptualizing audio storage. The key here is to recognize that a sampled audio signal can be represented similarly to a table in a spreadsheet, where each row corresponds to a discrete sample in time.</p>
            <p>Let’s define a CSV-based audio format with the following structure:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sample Index: Each row represents a discrete sample point. For example, in the case of a sine wave, each row corresponds to a specific point along the waveform. Typically the sample index is just a self-incrementing number. </li>
              <li>Quantized Value: The second column contains the quantized amplitude value for each sample.</li>
              <li>for simplicity sake, we assume that the sample rate is 44.1 kHz (this information is needed for later playback) and the bit depth is statically set to 16 bit.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>a simple CSV file could like this:</p>
            <pre data-language="csv"><code>Sample Index, Quantized Value
1, 0.32767
2, 0.32780
3, 0.32809
4, 0.32853
...</code></pre>
            <p>While CSV is of course not a practical choice for real-world audio storage due to its inefficiency and lack of support for metadata, compression, multiple channels, and other critical features, this exercise helps illustrate the fundamental concepts of how digital audio data can be organized and stored. Real-world formats like MP3, WAV, and FLAC utilize more sophisticated techniques to handle audio data efficiently, like</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Compression, for reducing file size while maintaining audio quality.</li>
              <li>Metadata, for storing additional information about the audio file, such as title, artist, and duration, sample rate, bit-depth</li>
              <li>Error Correction for ensuring data integrity during storage and playback.</li>
              <li>as well as support for multiple channels (e.g. for stereo signals)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="Mono-and-Stereo"><a href="#Mono-and-Stereo" title="Mono and Stereo"></a>Mono and Stereo</h4>
            <p><code>Mono</code> (short for monaural) refers to audio that is recorded and played back through a single channel. In a mono audio setup, all sounds are combined into one channel, and this single channel is then played through one or more speakers or headphones. The primary advantage of mono audio is its simplicity and the uniformity it provides — sound is uniformly distributed regardless of how many speakers are used. This makes mono suitable for applications where spatial sound is not crucial, such as telephone conversations or certain types of spoken-word recordings. Even audio on bigger venues is typical in mono.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, <code>stereo</code> (short for stereophonic) involves two audio channels: left and right. Stereo recording captures sound from two distinct channels, creating a sense of spatial separation between sounds. This allows for a more immersive listening experience because different sounds can be directed to different speakers or headphones. For instance, in a stereo mix, you might hear a guitar predominantly through the left speaker and a vocal through the right speaker. This spatial separation mimics the way humans naturally hear sounds in real life, making stereo particularly effective for music, movies, and other applications where a realistic sound field enhances the experience.</p>
            <h3 id="Audio-Output"><a href="#Audio-Output" title="Audio-Output"></a>Audio-Output</h3>
            <p>We’ve learned a lot about audio waves, and how audio waves can be captured and stored. Now it’s time to move forward and think about how digitally stored audio is played back. As we’ve discussed in the previous article, digital audio data is typically stored as a sequence of discrete samples that represent the amplitude of a sound wave at various points. This data is then streamed to your computers sound card. A DAC (Digital-To-Analog) converter converts these digital values into a continuous analog signal. This conversion process typically involves 2 steps. First, the digital samples are mapped to discrete voltage levels. In case your sound card outputs line-level, the highest possible digital representable value would map to 0.447V (447 mV). To smooth out the discrete steps and reconstruct a continuous waveform, the DAC uses a low-pass filter. This filter removes high-frequency artifacts (often referred to as “sampling noise”) that result from the discrete nature of the digital data. Finally, the filtered analog signal is sent to the output stage, which drives the speakers or headphones.</p>
            <h2 id="The-Role-of-a-Sound-Card-x2F-Audio-Interface"><a href="#The-Role-of-a-Sound-Card-x2F-Audio-Interface" title="The Role of a Sound Card / Audio Interface"></a>The Role of a Sound Card / Audio Interface</h2>
            <p>A sound card is a important component in a computer’s audio system. It handles the input and output of audio signals, converting between analog and digital forms. Sound cards typically include ADCs for recording, DACs for playback, and additional circuitry for audio processing.</p>
            <p>Typical Components of a Sound Card:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>ADCs (Analog-to-Digital Converters): Converts analog signals from microphones or other input devices into digital data.</li>
              <li>DACs (Digital-to-Analog Converters): Converts digital audio data into analog signals for playback through speakers or headphones.</li>
              <li>Amplifiers: Boosts the audio signal to a level that can drive speakers or headphones.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="What-makes-a-good-Sound-Card-x2F-Audio-Interface"><a href="#What-makes-a-good-Sound-Card-x2F-Audio-Interface" title="What makes a good Sound Card / Audio Interface?"></a>What makes a good Sound Card / Audio Interface?</h3>
            <p>Often times I get the question what audio interface is a good audio interface. Typically I don’t want to recommend a particular brand, but explain people what they should look for when comparing audio interfaces. Here’s a short and opinionated set of aspects you should look out for.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR): A high SNR indicates that the sound card produces clear audio with minimal background noise. Look for a sound card with a high SNR, typically 100 dB or higher.</li>
              <li>Total Harmonic Distortion (THD): Low THD means that the sound card introduces minimal distortion to the audio signal. Good sound cards often have THD ratings below 0.01%.</li>
              <li>Dynamic Range: A wide dynamic range allows the sound card to accurately reproduce both very quiet and very loud sounds without distortion or noise.</li>
              <li>Sampling Rate: A higher sampling rate allows for more accurate representation of audio. Common high-quality sound cards support rates up to 192 kHz or higher.</li>
              <li>Bit Depth: A higher bit depth enables better resolution of audio details. Good sound cards support 24-bit depth, providing a broader range of amplitudes and finer detail.</li>
              <li>Low Latency: Good sound cards have low latency, which is essential for real-time applications like gaming, live recording, and professional audio production. Latency is the delay between input and output, and lower latency ensures more immediate audio responses.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s delve into how Linux manages audio. The Linux audio system employs a modular and layered architecture to handle audio processing, which provides both abstraction and flexibility. Layering in Linux audio allows for a structured approach to audio management. By separating concerns into different layers, the system abstracts the complexities of lower-level operations, such as direct hardware interactions. This separation means that user-space applications do not need to deal with the specifics of hardware configurations, streamlining development and improving compatibility. Modularity complements this layered approach by allowing individual components to be swapped or reconfigured without disrupting the entire system. This means that different layers or components can be replaced or updated as needed. For example, if you plug in a headset, the system can dynamically switch from speaker output to headset output thanks to its modular design. Similarly, if you change your sound card or audio driver, the modular system can adapt without requiring extensive reconfiguration.</p>
            <h3 id="ALSA-Advanced-Linux-Sound-Architecture"><a href="#ALSA-Advanced-Linux-Sound-Architecture" title="ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture)"></a>ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture)</h3>
            <p>Let’s start with the foundation of all Linux systems when it comes to audio. ALSA is the core layer of the Linux audio stack. It provides low-level audio hardware control, including drivers for sound cards and basic audio functionality. ALSA provides a standardized interface for audio hardware, allowing applications to interact with sound cards and other audio devices without needing to know the specifics of the hardware. It includes a set of drivers for different types of sound cards and audio interfaces. These drivers translate the high-level audio commands from applications into low-level instructions understood by the hardware.</p>
            <p>ALSA operates in the kernel space, meaning it interacts directly with the Linux kernel. This position allows it to manage hardware resources and perform low-level audio operations efficiently. To allow the user space from profiting from ALSA, ALSA provides libraries and tools in user space, such as <code>libasound</code> (the ALSA library), which applications use to interface with the ALSA kernel drivers. This library offers functions for audio playback, recording, and control.</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.rtrace.io/images/linux-audio-stack-demystified/alsamixer.png" alt="Alsa Mixer - an application to control ALSA from th user space"></p>
            <p>ALSA supports multi-channel audio, enabling configurations like 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound. Additionally, it is designed to offer low-latency audio processing, which is essential for real-time applications like music production. Further, ALSA includes a mixer interface that allows users to control audio levels and settings, such as adjusting volume or muting channels.</p>
            <h3 id="JACK"><a href="#JACK" title="JACK"></a>JACK</h3>
            <p>JACK (the Jack Audio Connection Kit) is a professional-grade audio server designed for Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It is tailored for real-time, low-latency audio processing and is widely used in professional audio production environments. JACK is designed to provide low-latency, real-time audio processing. This is essential for applications where timing and synchronization are critical, such as live music performance, recording, and audio production. It allows multiple audio applications to connect and communicate with each other. This means that the output of one application can be routed to the input of another, enabling complex audio processing chains.</p>
            <p>JACK excels in delivering minimal latency, which is crucial for real-time audio tasks. This ensures that audio signals are processed and transmitted with minimal delay, maintaining synchronization and responsiveness. It offers sample-accurate synchronization between audio streams, ensuring precise timing and phase alignment across different audio applications and devices. JACK uses a client-server model, where the JACK server manages audio data and clients (applications) connect to it for audio processing. This modular approach allows for flexibility and scalability in audio setups. JACK includes transport control features that allow users to synchronize playback and recording across multiple applications, making it easier to manage complex audio projects. JACK builds on top of ALSA and requires ALSA to be installed and configured correctly.</p>
            <h3 id="PulseAudio"><a href="#PulseAudio" title="PulseAudio"></a>PulseAudio</h3>
            <p>PulseAudio is a sound server for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that sits on top of lower-level sound systems such as ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture). It provides a higher-level interface for audio management, offering additional features and flexibility beyond what is available directly through ALSA. PulseAudio acts as an intermediary between applications and the underlying sound hardware. It handles audio streams, mixing, and routing, allowing multiple applications to produce sound simultaneously and manage their audio independently. One of PulseAudio’s key features is its ability to stream audio over a network. This allows users to play audio from one machine on another machine or device connected to the same network.</p>
            <p>PulseAudio enables the mixing of multiple audio streams into a single output. This means you can listen to music while receiving notifications from other applications, all mixed seamlessly into your speakers or headphones. Additionally, it allows for independent volume control of each application. This means you can adjust the volume of your music player separately from your web browser or other applications. PulseAudio supports various audio effects and processing features, such as equalization, sound enhancements, and echo cancellation. Further, it manages audio devices and allows easy switching between them. For instance, you can switch audio output from speakers to headphones or to an external Bluetooth device without disrupting playback.</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.rtrace.io/images/linux-audio-stack-demystified/pulseaudio-architecture.png" alt="PulseAudio Architecture"></p>
            <p>PulseAudio provides a more intuitive and user-friendly way to manage audio compared to working directly with ALSA. Its ability to handle various audio sources and outputs simultaneously, along with network capabilities, makes it versatile for different audio needs and setups. By providing advanced features such as audio mixing, device switching, and network streaming, PulseAudio contributes to a richer and more flexible audio experience on Linux systems - particularly the Linux Desktop. While it’s a little bit of a meme, PulseAudio made “the year of the Linux desktop” a lot more likely.</p>
            <h3 id="PipeWire"><a href="#PipeWire" title="PipeWire"></a>PipeWire</h3>
            <p>PipeWire is a modern multimedia framework designed for Linux systems that aims to unify and enhance the handling of both audio and video streams. Developed as a replacement for both PulseAudio and JACK, PipeWire provides a flexible and efficient infrastructure for managing complex multimedia tasks. PipeWire combines the capabilities of audio servers like PulseAudio and low-latency audio servers like JACK into a single framework. It also supports video processing and capture, making it a comprehensive solution for managing both audio and video streams. Like JACK, PipeWire offers low-latency audio processing, which is crucial for professional audio applications such as live music production and sound design.</p>
            <p>PipeWire is designed to be highly flexible, accommodating various use cases ranging from consumer audio and video to professional audio production and video conferencing. It provides a unified API that can handle both audio and video streams, simplifying development and integration for applications that need to process multimedia content.Further, PipeWire is engineered from the ground up to deliver low-latency audio and real-time performance, making it suitable for high-performance audio tasks and complex multimedia workflows. Finally, PipeWire includes features for improved security and sandboxing, allowing applications to access only the resources they need and protecting against potential security vulnerabilities.</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.rtrace.io/images/linux-audio-stack-demystified/pipewire-qpwgraph.png" alt="qpwgraph, a graphical utility to understand/display audio routing with Pipewire"></p>
            <p>By combining audio and video management into a single framework, PipeWire provides a more integrated and cohesive approach to handling multimedia content. Its design incorporates modern requirements and use cases, including enhanced security, better real-time performance, and support for a wide range of multimedia applications. PipeWire also offers compatibility with existing audio and video servers, easing the transition from older systems and allowing for gradual adoption. To give an example, even if one of your applications is built to use PulseAudio, PipeWire supports a PulseAudio compatible input API, so that an application does not have to care if it’s PulseAudio or PipeWire. A similar input API exists also for JACK - PipeWire will emulate the Sound Server API of JACK. Ulike PuleAudio and JACK, PipeWire does not require ALSA on a system, in fact if ALSA is installed the output of ALSA is very likely pushed through PipeWire.</p>
            <h3 id="So-what-is-it-a-sound-server-does"><a href="#So-what-is-it-a-sound-server-does" title="So what is it a sound server does?"></a>So what is it a sound server does?</h3>
            <h4 id="Mixing-multiple-input-streams"><a href="#Mixing-multiple-input-streams" title="Mixing multiple input streams"></a>Mixing multiple input streams</h4>
            <p>In essence, a sound server acts as an intermediary that takes multiple audio input streams with varying sample rates and bit depths, mixes them into a single output signal, and sends it to the sound card. For example, imagine one application generating a sine wave and another producing a rectangular wave. In today’s world, it would be unimaginable not to be able to watch a video while simultaneously receiving notification sounds from your messenger (or more generally to receive audio from multiple input sources). This is where the sound server implementations such as PipeWire, JACK and PulseAudio come in — a sound server combines the two (or more) input signals into one output signal and outputs it to the sound card. The sound server achieves this by summing each sample of the input signals, effectively merging multiple inputs into a single output. The operation performed is sample-wise addition. In case a faster sampled signal needs to mixed with a lower-sampled signal, the audio server will also have to interpolate the values for the signal with the lower sample rate. All this is happening in real time with little to no latency introduced (depending on the buffer size of the mixer buffer).</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.rtrace.io/images/linux-audio-stack-demystified/sum-of-2-input-signals-as-output-signal.png" alt="Mixing together 2 input signals to generate one output signal"></p>
            <h4 id="Multiple-Output-Streams-x2F-Mixes"><a href="#Multiple-Output-Streams-x2F-Mixes" title="Multiple Output Streams/Mixes"></a>Multiple Output Streams/Mixes</h4>
            <p>If you own a laptop, there’s high chance you have 2 audio output devices. One Headphone output if you connect your headphones to the audio output jack. And one for the built-in speakers in your laptop. A sound server can also output audio to multiple outputs at the same time. Let’s say you prefer listening to music through your headphones, and a friend is in your room and you’d like to show them a cool track you enjoy. So you decide to activate output on both devices at the same time.</p>
            <h4 id="Volume-Control-per-input-stream"><a href="#Volume-Control-per-input-stream" title="Volume Control per input stream"></a>Volume Control per input stream</h4>
            <p>Typically each input stream comes from different applications on your Linux Desktop. And sometimes you’d like to individually control volume for each of your applications. Let’s say you’re watching a movie and you’d like to mute all messengers in the meanwhile. You can configure the sound server to reduce/mute the volume of the corresponding input streams.</p>
            <h4 id="Virtual-Outputs"><a href="#Virtual-Outputs" title="Virtual Outputs"></a>Virtual Outputs</h4>
            <p>Not every signal needs to be routed to an actual output. Think about your microphone. Most of the time the microphone is not outputted on your speakers/headphones, yet the input stream is provided to applications such as your favorite VOIP/conferencing tool. The concept of virtual outputs allows you to create an arbitrary number of output streams that applications can consume. </p>
            <h4 id="Sound-effects-for-streams"><a href="#Sound-effects-for-streams" title="Sound effects for streams"></a>Sound effects for streams</h4>
            <p>A sound server allows to apply various effects to individual input streams or output streams using effect plugins. These plugins, available in formats such as LADSPA, CLAP, VST2, VST3, AU, and RTAS, allow you to integrate software effects into your audio routing chain seamlessly.</p>
            <h5 id="Example-Using-a-Compressor"><a href="#Example-Using-a-Compressor" title="Example: Using a Compressor"></a>Example: Using a Compressor</h5>
            <p>One practical example of an effect plugin is a compressor. If you often find yourself adjusting the volume while watching movies—turning it down during loud action scenes and back up for quieter dialogue—a compressor can help. By adding a compressor to the input stream of your media player or browser, you can reduce the volume of the loud parts without affecting the quieter sections. Most compressors include a make-up gain feature to increase the overall volume after compression, ensuring a balanced listening experience.</p>
            <h5 id="Example-Adding-Reverb"><a href="#Example-Adding-Reverb" title="Example: Adding Reverb"></a>Example: Adding Reverb</h5>
            <p>Another use case is enhancing your microphone input with a bright reverb effect, making it sound as though you’re speaking in a large room. This can add a sense of space and presence to your voice.</p>
            <h5 id="Example-Applying-an-Equalizer"><a href="#Example-Applying-an-Equalizer" title="Example: Applying an Equalizer"></a>Example: Applying an Equalizer</h5>
            <p>You might also want to use an equalizer to adjust your output stream. For instance, if your speakers produce a muddy bass around 200Hz, you can use an equalizer to reduce the gain in that frequency range, resulting in clearer sound.</p>
            <h5 id="Example-Denoising"><a href="#Example-Denoising" title="Example: Denoising"></a>Example: Denoising</h5>
            <p>If your microphone has a lot of background noise, you can apply a denoising effect to clean up the signal before it reaches your VOIP tool. This ensures that your voice comes through clearly during calls.</p>
            <h5 id="Combining-Multiple-Effects"><a href="#Combining-Multiple-Effects" title="Combining Multiple Effects"></a>Combining Multiple Effects</h5>
            <p>For more advanced setups, you can combine multiple effects like reverbs, delays, compressors, and equalizers into your audio chain. Whether you need simple adjustments or complex processing, a robust sound server in the Linux audio stack provides the flexibility and control you need.</p>
            <p>The modular and layered design of the Linux audio stack, combined with the wide array of available plugins, allows you to customize your audio experience to suit your specific needs. Whether you’re looking to enhance your media playback, improve your microphone input, or create a unique sound environment, the Linux audio stack has the tools to make it happen.</p>
            <h4 id="Providing-an-API-for-application-developers"><a href="#Providing-an-API-for-application-developers" title="Providing an API for application developers"></a>Providing an API for application developers</h4>
            <p>A very important aspect of a sound server is to provide a convenient API for application developers to consume. The following Python script demonstrates how the ALSA API can be used to playback a *.wav file.</p>
            <pre data-language="python"><code>import audioop
import alsaaudio

# Initialize ALSA-Audio-Output
audio_output = alsaaudio.PCM(alsaaudio.PCM_PLAYBACK)
audio_output.setchannels(1) # mono
audio_output.setrate(44100) # 44.1 kHz
audio_output.setformat(alsaaudio.PCM_FORMAT_S32_LE)

with open('example-audio-file.wav', 'rb') as wav_file:
    try:
        audio_output.setperiodsize(160)
        data = wav_file.read(320)

        while data:
            # Write read bits of audio file to sound card
            audio_output.write(data)
            data = wav_file.read(320)

    except Exception as exc:
        print(exc)

            <p>PipeWire is emerging as a versatile and powerful option that integrates the best features of both JACK and PulseAudio, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases from general desktop audio to professional audio and video production. JACK remains the best choice for specialized professional audio tasks requiring the lowest latency and real-time performance. PulseAudio continues to excel in general desktop and consumer audio applications, offering ease of use and broad compatibility.</p>
            <p>The Linux distribution you’re using likely employs either PipeWire or PulseAudio. RHEL-based are on PipeWire already (e.g. Fedora), most Debian-based are still on PulseAudio, but PipeWire is installable. If you’re satisfied with your current audio stack, there’s no need to change it. However, if you seek lower-latency capabilities, consider upgrading to PipeWire. Generally speaking I’d not recommend transitioning to JACK unless you’re already familiar with its configuration and setup. PipeWire will eventually completely replace PulseAudio and JACK, as from an architectural and technical view it is a lot more capable.</p>

For legacy billing and EMR/EHR and related systems code, respectfully. One guy gets flown out to the east coast from his ”chateau” in Utah every month or two; the only downside is he’s on-call pretty much all year round.

                  <p>Assembly would be a good start. But to really make use of that you need to learn the internal intricacies of processor architectures and operating systems. If you want to be employable, there's just a gigantic amount of seemingly boring details to learn before you can even start to build something interesting. With high level languages you can jump into the job market almost immediately, so the cost of entry vs. potential reward is better for most people. If you don't have fun when spending years of your life banging your head while digging down incredibly complex rabbit holes, it's probably not worth it.</p>

She received plenty of solid job offers, all with excellent pay, but one of them stood out. It was a company that made back-end software for credit unions. Not sexy work, but what stood out to my friend was the how genuine the people she talked to during the "interview" process seemed. They asked about her life experience more than her work experience. When she met with execs they never even talked about actual work. She said they were very upfront about the fact that they couldn't compete with "the big guys" on pay, but they take their supportive company culture very seriously - the average length-of-employment was over 10 years. She said they offered her access to the office, where she could freely "interview" anyone rando she wanted about the company. She did, and everyone she talked to raved about working there.</p><p>She decided to accept the offer from the not-sexy credit union software company, knowing she could've earned at least 30% more elsewhere. She kept using the word "genuine" when she talked about the people she met during the "interview" process, and that's what attracted her.</p><p>Well, about 2 years after accepting the offer she was diagnosed with breast cancer. (tl;dr = dealing with cancer sucks. constant doctor appointments. chemo treatments. pain. vomiting. life/death uncertainty. and so on.) She said her company was unbelievable during her cancer battle. She didn't work for almost a year (her bosses wouldn't let her), and they never even talked about sick leave or FMLA or disability - nothing. They just kept her on the payroll like normal, for almost a full year! She said her bosses would call all the time, asking about the latest test results, how she was feeling, did she need anything, etc. And, to her surprise, after about 2 years of treatments, almost the entire company showed up to watch her ring the bell.</p><p>Moral of the story: Money is great, but it's really not everything.</p></div></td></tr>

A person familiar with Wiz's thinking cited antitrust and investor concerns as part of the reason for abandoning a potential deal.</p><p>Rappaport wrote that the company would focus on its next milestones: an initial public offering and $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. The company had been eyeing both targets well before talks with Google had been reported.</p><p>The deal would have nearly doubled the $12 billion valuation of the startup from its most recent round of funding. Wiz was founded in 2020 and has grown rapidly under Rappaport, who had been targeting an IPO as recently as May. The company hit <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/09/wiz-ascent-to-10-billion-valuation-shows-cloud-security-still-huge.html">$100 million in annual recurring revenue</a> after 18 months, and reached $350 million last year. </p><p>Wiz's cloud security products include prevention, active detection and response, a portfolio that's appealed to large firms and would have helped Google compete with <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-3"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/">Microsoft</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span>, which also sells security software.</p><p>Alphabet's cloud segment has faced increased competition from frontrunners Microsoft and <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-4"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/">Amazon</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span>.&nbsp;The cloud unit reached profitability in 2023 after years of hefty investment.</p><p>While Google Cloud has seen consistent growth in recent years, the unit, led by CEO Thomas Kurian, is under pressure to continue growing in efforts to capture business during the AI boom.</p><p>Google didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Exits in technology have been rare this year, between startups waiting for more receptive markets before going public and a challenging regulatory environment for acquisitions.</p><p>The collapse of the transaction will be seen as a disappointment by Index Ventures, Insight Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sequoia and other venture backers that have raised multibillion-dollar funds in recent years.</p><p>Funds that run into the billions require exits of over $10 billion in order to generate sizable returns for their limited partners, and those events have been rare, said Brendan Burke, a senior analyst at PitchBook. </p><p>Wiz's founders previously built security startup Adallom, raised money from Sequoia and Index and sold the business to Microsoft for $320 million in 2015. Former Sequoia leader Doug Leone&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wiz.io/about" target="_blank">has said</a>&nbsp;investing in Wiz in its earliest days was "a no-brainer."</p><p>Soon after Wiz's launch came the Covid pandemic.

Google's largest deal remains the acquisition of hardware maker Motorola in 2012 for $12.5 billion. The company ended up selling assets from that purchase to Lenovo for $2.9 billion in 2014. Google recently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/10/hubspot-shares-plunge-16percent-on-report-that-alphabet-is-shelving-interest.html">ended conversations</a> to acquire sales software maker HubSpot.</p><p>In an interview with CNBC's Sara Eisen and Carl Quintanilla at the New York Stock Exchange last year, Eisen asked Rappaport if he wants to take Wiz public.</p><p>"Yeah, definitely," he said.
