   <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration violated the First Amendment rights of Education Department employees when it replaced their personalized out-of-office e-mail notifications with partisan language blaming Democrats for the government shutdown.</p>

   <p>"When government employees enter public service, they do not sign away their First Amendment rights," U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/10733279/american-federation-of-government-employees-v-us-department-of-education/?q=AMERICAN+FEDERATION+OF+GOVERNMENT+EMPLOYEES&amp;type=o&amp;order_by=score+desc&amp;judge=Cooper&amp;stat_Published=on&amp;court=dcd" target="_blank">wrote in his decision</a> on Friday, "and they certainly do not sign up to be a billboard for any given administration's partisan views."</p>   <p>The lawsuit was brought by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE).</p>   <p>"This ridiculous ploy by the Trump administration was a clear violation of the First Amendment rights of the workers at the Education Department," said Rachel Gittleman, the president of AFGE Local 252, which represents many Education Department workers, in a statement. She added it is "one of the many ways the Department's leadership has threatened, harassed and demoralized these hardworking public servants in the last 10 months."</p>   
   <p>Cooper ordered the department to restore union members' personalized out-of-office email notices immediately. If that could not be done, he warned, then the department would be required to remove the partisan language from all employees' accounts, union member or not.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5602859-101" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>According to court records, in the run-up to the government shutdown, Education Department employees were told to create an out-of-office message for their government email accounts to be used while workers were furloughed. The department even gave employees boilerplate language they could adapt that simply said:</p>   <p>"We are unable to respond to your request due to a lapse in appropriations for the Department of Education. We will respond to your request when appropriations are enacted. Thank you."</p>   <p>But, on the shutdown's first day, the department's deputy chief of staff for operations overrode staffers' personal messages and replaced them with this partisan autoreply:</p>   <p>"Thank you for contacting me. On September 19, 2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution. Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations. Due to the lapse in appropriations I am currently in furlough status. I will respond to emails once government functions resume."</p>   
   <p>While the message was written in the first person, multiple employees <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/05/nx-s1-5563182/shutdown-lawsuit-education-department-partisan-messages" target="_blank">told NPR</a> they did not write it and were not told it would replace the out-of-office messages they had written.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5602859-102" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>At the time, Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications, said in a statement to NPR: "The email reminds those who reach out to Department of Education employees that we cannot respond because Senate Democrats are refusing to vote for a clean CR and fund the government. Where's the lie?"</p>   <p>In his decision, Cooper lambasted the department for "turning its own workforce into political spokespeople through their official email accounts. The Department may have added insult to injury, but it also overplayed its hand."</p>   <p>The department did not respond to an NPR request to comment on the ruling.</p>   <p>"Nonpartisanship is the foundation of the federal civil-service system," Cooper wrote, a principle that Congress enshrined in the Hatch Act.</p>   <p>That law, passed in 1939, was intended to protect public employees from political pressure and, according to the <a href="https://osc.gov/Services/pages/hatchact.aspx" target="_blank">U.S. Office of Special Counsel</a>, "to ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion."<br></p>

<p><em>A follow up to The <a href="https://prestonbyrne.com/2025/10/16/the-ofcom-files/">Ofcom Files</a>.</em></p>



<h2>Some notes on Ofcom’s strategy to date.</h2>



<p>As many of you know, I represent the U.S. website 4chan, pro bono, in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/71209929/4chan-community-support-llc-v-uk-office-of-communications/">its U.S. federal lawsuit</a>&nbsp;against the UK’s communications regulator, Ofcom, together with my co-counsel Ron Coleman. The suit seeks to defend 4chan from the UK’s attempts to censor that website using the UK’s new Internet censorship law, the Online Safety Act.</p>



<p>What some of you may <em>not</em> know is that I have personally committed to defend, pro bono, any U.S. website which operates lawfully in the United States – no matter how large or small – against the UK’s attempts to infringe on the First Amendment.</p>



<p>And indeed, I am currently representing every single U.S. social-media enforcement target of the UK Online Safety Act, again pro bono,<em> </em>without exception. I will continue to do so until the Online Safety Act’s capacity to harm American citizens is destroyed, by America <a href="https://x.com/prestonjbyrne/status/1979579530344813000">enacting a shield law</a>.</p>



<p>This means, necessarily, taking on some of the most controversial sites on the web as one’s clients. One such client, a social media forum called “Sanctioned Suicide” or “SaSu,” has long been a target for Ofcom’s ire because of the subject matter that the site hosts – principally, it is a mental health webforum where suicidal people are allowed to discuss the most taboo subject of all taboo subjects, suicide itself, and how they plan to go about it.</p>



<p>To say that this site’s subject matter is controversial is an understatement; as a Catholic I freely admit I struggled at first with representing the site. SaSu, 4chan, Gab, and Kiwi Farms – the complete list of Ofcom’s U.S. enforcement targets to date – are some of the most unsympathetic websites in the world, from a political point of view.</p>



<p>This was, in my view, a deliberate strategy by Ofcom: pick the most radioactive free speech targets in the world, isolate them in confidential proceedings, punish them, and publicly shame them when you claim the fine notices or blocking orders as a win. The only way to counter that strategy is to ensure that no target goes without competent counsel, every target knows what Ofcom is trying to do, and every case will be fought like hell, in as public a fashion as possible. As Justice Brandeis said, “sunlight is the best disinfectant.”</p>



<p>The victory condition of the U.S. pushback against Ofcom is the successful defense of the First Amendment – all of the First Amendment. If we concede even a scintilla of our constitutional rights, we fail. If we let any target fight alone, we fail. If any censorship demand gets through our border, we fail.</p>



<p>That means we defend every site, however small or controversial it may be, from foreign attempts to infringe on their constitutional rights. It means not giving up so much as an inch of ground without a major fight, if those are the instructions. It means we must not ever lose.</p>



<p>We do this because the defense of any American is the defense of us all. </p>



<h2>The story of Ofcom v SaSu</h2>



<p>SaSu is a tiny forum which didn’t have much of an appetite for a fight. Accordingly, when Ofcom came calling at the end of February, SaSu more or less immediately IP blocked the entire UK in hopes of avoiding enforcement action. (Ofcom claims this occurred in July; it in fact occurred in May.)</p>



<p>And, for a time, this worked. Today, however, I can reveal that Ofcom has reversed its decision and is going after the site anyway.</p>



<p>Ofcom alleges that SaSu’s geo-block went down. </p>

<p>This is demonstrably false. The block has been consistently functional for months, and when Ofcom’s e-mail landed in my inbox, I went to check it myself by using my own VPN to access the Internet through a London IP (unlike UK policymakers, I know how to use one). Sure enough, SaSu’s nationwide site block prevented me from viewing the site.</p>

<p>What appears to have happened is that SaSu had a site mirror and that someone figured out a way to hit the mirror – which was also subject to the geoblock, something which took me under a minute to personally confirm – without using a VPN.</p>



<p>This is possible for a range of reasons. The primary one is that the notion of a “UK based IP” is nonsense. Geolocation databases work by figuring out where people log in from and only after doing a lot of pattern recognition do those addresses get associated with that location. So there will be UK-based IPs that geolocate to Poland, for example, even though the end-user is sitting in the UK, because the database thinks that that IP address belongs in Poland.</p>



<p>What might have happened is that a third party, understanding this, could have found SaSu’s mirror, hit SaSu’s mirror with one of these IPs, and then handed the file off to the regulator as some kind of “gotcha” demonstrating that the IP geoblock was ineffective, and using the fact of the access plus the fact that there was a mirror URL to claim that SaSu was somehow trying to dishonestly mislead the regulator about its compliance with the OSA through geoblocking. (The reasons why SaSu had a mirror are SaSu’s alone/none of Ofcom’s fucking business; what it suffices to note is that both SaSu’s main site and the mirror blocked the UK.) If this is in fact what happened, it would have been a profoundly dishonest tactic by UK activists to try to bring down regulatory hellfire on a disfavored American company, and it merits a full parliamentary investigation (though, I won’t hold my breath waiting for that).</p>



<p>Ofcom, in reopening the investigation on the basis that the geoblock was down when the geoblock was in fact up, (1) reveals that it has no idea how the Internet works and (2) has made a pretty titanic mistake. Now it’ll either need to assert that the geoblock isn’t effective (when, for the most part, it is) or it’ll need to climb down (causing fury among the political constituencies which have so much power in Westminster that they forced the file to reopen in the first place).</p>



<p>What seems clear to me is that Ofcom needs a scalp to present to Ofcom’s political masters. It’s been decided that SaSu is it. SaSu is, arguably, the most important scapegoat that was used to justify the Online Safety Act. Web censorship advocates like the Molly Rose Foundation – one of the major NGO sponsors of the Online Safety Act – seemingly exist for the sole purpose of advocating for increasingly insane levels of censorship of the Internet for everyone in the UK, always pointing to a single target as the justification, and never calling for any solution other than mass censorship of the entire country.</p>



<p>That target is, and for years has been, SaSu. The NGOs in question refuse to name the site, ostensibly for harm reduction purposes, but this also prevents people from openly engaging with the issue and having an honest conversation about what the site is, what (American) legal protections it benefits from, and, therefore, what practical limitations there are on the UK trying to close it down, both now and when the UK was drafting and enacting the UK Online Safety Act. </p>



<p>The UK’s inability to have those honest conversations at the proper time is what is causing the Online Safety Act to, slowly but surely, fail as an international regulatory scheme. This habit also led the UK to enact the Online Safety Act instead of adopting other, less censorial, approaches to make the Internet a safer place, which were ignored.</p>



<p>Even today, aforementioned “Safety” NGO and others are using the simple fact of the SaSu’s existence to try to convince legislators that a nationwide <a href="https://x.com/moo9000/status/1981702036493393991">VPN ban</a> that applies to every one of the 69 million men, women, and children in the United Kingdom is necessary to end SaSu specifically – tantamount to using a thermonuclear bomb to swat a fly. Only three weeks ago, these groups called for the Prime Minister to open a parliamentary inquiry and wrote a <a href="https://mollyrosefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MissedChancesLostLives.pdf">51-page report</a> seeking to apply additional pressure for retaliatory action and additional global censorship powers. SaSu was even <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/uk/home-news/keir-starmer-donald-trump-prime-minister-xi-jinping-truth-social-b2797406.html">mentioned by Keir Starmer</a>, albeit not by name, when he tried justifying the Online Safety Act to President Trump.</p>



<p>There was even direct political pressure put on Ofcom <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/50025/documents/269445/default/">by Parliament itself</a> on October 31st to do something about SaSu. </p>



<p>One could be forgiven for thinking that SaSu is the UK censorship-industrial complex’s favorite company, given how much they talk about it to practically anyone who will listen. In a way, it is the Online Safety Act’s necessary target: these organizations have spent years saying that the Online Safety Act was the required solution to a company like SaSu. If the Act fails to end it, the Act itself also fails. The credibility of the entire regime rests on beating this one website. </p>



<p>For this reason, SaSu was the very first site Ofcom targeted for enforcement action in February 2025, months before Ofcom went after 4chan or anyone else. When that happened, the UK censorship NGO sector clearly expected SaSu to get wiped off the face of the Earth. </p>



<p>But SaSu, rudely, <em>didn’t die</em>, a fact which makes the UK censorship-industrial apparatus incandescent. </p>



<p>The UK has no power to shut the site down, because t<strong>he site and its operators are in the United States, they are not violating U.S. law, and they are conducting themselves in a manner that is protected by the First Amendment</strong>.</p>



<p>So, it appears, as with 4chan, Ofcom has elected to proceed with a mock execution. Based on the fact that the nationwide IP block is still live, the precedent they want to set – the message they want to send – seems pretty clear to me: <strong>Geo-IP blocking the entire UK is no longer enough to comply with the Online Safety Act</strong>.</p>



<p>Ofcom is trying to set the precedent that no matter where you are in the world, and no matter how much you try to keep UK users off your site, Ofcom believes you have to follow its rules – even if you’re American and you’re engaged in constitutionally protected speech and conduct. To that end, Ofcom has <strong>renewed its previous threats of fines, arrest, and imprisonment, against SaSu and its operators – all Americans</strong>.</p>



<p>This is not what I expected. I had expected the UK, after encountering serious resistance to its extraterritorial expansion plans in the United States with 4chan’s refusal to comply, to start considering the merits of backing down. Instead, the UK is choosing to escalate, going after a target who the Online Safety Act’s political masters desperately want to, even <em>need </em>to, eradicate, even though that target made good-faith efforts to block the UK from its services.</p>



<p>Hate to spoil the party, but Ofcom will need to go try some other country’s websites to set that precedent. The UK is not going to be allowed to lay a finger on an American.</p>



<p>I reproduce relevant correspondence below. We have also sent this correspondence to the White House, both Houses of Congress, individuals spearheading legislative initiatives to erect <a href="https://prestonbyrne.com/2025/10/18/the-granite-act-how-congress-can-strike-back-against-foreign-censors/">censorship shield laws</a> in four different states, and the nation’s leading free speech advocacy organizations.</p>



<h2>My message to Washington and state legislators</h2>



<p>Free speech test cases are rarely made in relation to popular speech. But we call them “test cases” for a reason: because they are the test of the boundaries, and their outcome determines the future trajectory of the law and human behavior.</p>



<p>The lesson from this correspondence is unmistakable: the UK thinks that anyone who refuses to adhere to its content rules, wherever they are based, is fair game for threats of fines and imprisonment, even if they try to wall themselves off from the UK with comprehensive blocks of UK IP addresses.</p>



<p>This includes every single person in the United States. Companies like SaSu are the canaries in the coal mine. Companies most of us use every day like Meta or X are next.</p>



<p>This problem is not going to go away. As we have seen with the <a href="https://x.com/SkyNews/status/1986319410244518258">escalating war of words between the UK and X</a>, which culminated in a British King’s Counsel putting X’s Head of Global Government Affairs through a Maoist-style <a href="https://x.com/ShipleyWrites/status/1986479109489226085">pro-Online Safety Act struggle session</a> at an inquiry hearing only yesterday, it is clear the United Kingdom – or, at least, the bunch of yahoos who currently run it – will not be content to allow any American to enjoy the full measure of their constitutional rights online, no matter how obscure the U.S. site in question may be.</p>

<p>They will attempt to crush anyone who resists, even if that resistance is in the form of Americans doing everything in our power to block the entire UK from our services to try to get British censors off our backs. The UK is willing to punish and threaten American companies – large and small – and American citizens in order to set the precedent that the UK is in charge of America’s Internet.</p>



<p>Our government should not allow this to be done to any American, on principle. No American client of mine will ever bend to that sort of pressure. We need to act now to prevent our most valuable companies, and their hundreds of millions of American users, from being subjected to it.</p>



<p>These attempts to disrespect and override American sovereignty must be answered before the same thing is done to websites used by millions of other American citizens, when the UK inevitably turns its attention to the larger and more well-moderated services we all know and love, including all of our <a href="https://x.com/fttechnews/status/1984123722412810485">world-beating AI companies</a>.</p>



<p>In the final analysis, American citizens shouldn’t have to put up with this bullshit from foreigners. We fought, and won, many wars to secure our freedoms.</p>



<p>As I have been doing for nearly an entire year, I strongly urge the White House and Congress, and legislators in each of the fifty States, to intervene to protect the free speech of all American citizens.</p>



<h2>UPDATE, 7 NOVEMBER 2025</h2>



<p>Ofcom replied to our initial e-mail responding to their reopening this investigation (see first PDF at the bottom of this post) and this blog post as follows:</p>

<p>This e-mail is extraordinary: Ofcom didn’t like that I referred to its enforcement effort against SaSu as a coordinated, politically motivated hit, so it felt the need – <em>in correspondence to a target’s lawyer</em> – to specifically respond to the allegation and complain about the public defense of my client that I made in a blog post. </p>



<p>As to the blog post, we’ll deal with that in a second.</p>



<p>It’s pretty obviously a true statement that this investigation has a political dimension to it. </p>



<p>Putting aside, for a moment, the fact that a certain UK NGO – the country’s leading pro-censorship organization…</p>



<ul>
<li>kvetched to Parliament about this matter in September, </li>



<li>called for the Prime Minister to open an investigation into my client in October, and then </li>



<li>triggered the House of Lords’ Digital Committee to give Ofcom a written dressing-down repeating that NGO’s point of view,<em> verbatim,</em> <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/lords/media-centre/house-of-lords-media-notices/2025/october2025/lords-communications-committee-write-to-ofcom-to-flag-concerns-with-implementation-of-the-online-safety-act/">only last week</a>,</li>
</ul>



<p>…it remains true that Ofcom reopened the investigation to minor but noticeable press fanfare and – miraculously! – also had that very NGO extensively quoted in a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/major-update-online-suicide-forum-36204155">press drop</a> that landed a mere <strong>57 minutes</strong> after I received Ofcom’s message, followed up by prime morning TV spots for that UK NGO 14 hours later (approximately 8AM local time in London) – during which time the UK NGO called for my client to be fined, arrested, and prosecuted!</p>



<p>All for conduct that is perfectly lawful in the United States. Exhibit A:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If my client’s site is truly that dangerous to UK internet users, <strong>why did Ofcom wait two days preparing a press campaign instead of, oh, I dunno, calling us up and reporting any suspected “bugs” in the geo-block so that they can be patched?</strong></p>



<p>Particularly when the target was voluntarily doing so <em>already</em>?</p>



<p>The answer, in all probability, is that highly political pressure groups are working hand-in-glove with the UK’s public bodies, Parliament and others, to try to show that the OSA can be successfully wielded against all those pesky Americans who won’t just be sensible and surrender our rights simply because a bunch of censors in the UK ordered us to.</p>



<p>Interesting how Ofcom treats investigations as confidential every time they get a FOIA request or a request for comment from a journalist, but not, apparently, when Parliament wants a prominent American scalp and they need to coordinate with friendly media and pro-censorship groups.</p>



<p>Approaching the matter from this perspective, I replied to Ofcom as follows:</p>

<p>Utterly extraordinary. Let me explain what probably happened here.</p>



<p>The UK regulator has now publicly confirmed that the “mirror” site for my client’s site is not accessible in the UK. This, of course, has been the case all along, as I verified within ten minutes of receiving Ofcom’s email on Thursday afternoon. I’m not sure what, exactly, happened here, but I am advised that both mirror and the base site in this case were both covered by the IP block at all times. </p>



<p>If I had to guess, it’s that some NGO found some UK-based IP addresses which weren’t captured by the block because they weren’t properly geolocated. They probably then assembled a dossier and reported this to the UK regulator, and the UK regulator, under pressure from its political masters in Westminster, decided to do a rush job on enforcement and drive a truck through a hole that can be measured in micrometers, betting no one would be willing to publicly defend what is, arguably, the most controversial lawful website on the planet.</p>



<p>They bet wrong.</p>



<p>And the fact that Ofcom felt the need to put up a corrective press release 36 hours after the start of the reopened “investigation,” and a mere 72 hours (max) after getting a tip from the Samaritans? They’re not treating this like a law enforcement investigation, where they’d take their time and make sure they got it right.</p>



<p>They’re definitely not treating it like a public safety matter, where they know how to reach us and know that I generally respond within the hour.  </p>



<p>When you’re doing advance leaks to the press and rushing out statements to rebut your critics in real time, you’re not running a public safety operation. Ofcom is running a media campaign to defend the credibility of the Online Safety Act project.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, the IP block doesn’t really matter: my client has that block up to minimize hassle from aggressive foreign regulators and to keep their spam out of its inbox, not because it has any legal obligation to give a single solitary fuck about what an unelected British bureaucrat tells it to do.</p>



<p>Ofcom doesn’t have the legal power to order around my dog in the United States. It certainly doesn’t have the legal power to order around American citizens.</p>



<p><strong>I hope Washington, D.C. sees this and understands that this bullshit is what awaits every American Internet company, including Meta and X, if the United States doesn’t put a stop to this now.</strong> </p>



<p>Ultimately, what Ofcom is doing here is the perfect modern-day lesson lesson for why the First Amendment exists in the first place. A British regulator is threatening Americans in order to censor them, on pain of jail time, using only the flimsiest of excuses and immense, overbroad, and highly discretionary enforcement powers, to please politicians.</p>



<p>America and the UK fought a war over this. UK regulators doing this to Americans for doing nothing other than lawfully exercising their constitutional rights is not a situation the United States should ever accept.</p>



<div><p>I call upon the Trump Administration to use all available trade levers to put this misbehavior to an end, and upon the U.S. Congress to enact a foreign censorship shield law.</p><p>—</p></div>

              <p>I want you to understand what it is to live in Chicago.</p>


<p>Every day my phone buzzes. It is a neighborhood group: four people were
kidnapped at the corner drugstore. A friend a mile away sends a Slack message:
she was at the scene when masked men assaulted and abducted two people on the
street. A plumber working on my pipes is distraught, and I find out that two of his
employees were kidnapped that morning. A week later it happens again.</p>


<p>An email arrives. Agents with guns <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/11/05/daycare-teacher-taken-by-ice-north-side-immigration">have chased a teacher</a> into the school where she
works. They did not have a warrant. They dragged her away, ignoring her and her colleagues’ pleas to show proof of her documentation. That evening I stand a few feet from the parents of Rayito de Sol and listen to them describe, with anguish, how good
Ms. Diana was to their children. What it is like to have <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/video-shows-ice-agents-grabbing-202310296.html">strangers with guns
traumatize your
kids</a>.
For a teacher to hide a three-year-old child <a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/chicago/2025/11/05/daycare-worker-pulled-out-of-school-by-armed-federal-agents-traumatizing-parents-say/">for fear they might be
killed</a>.
How their relatives will no longer leave the house. I hear the pain and fury in
their voices, and I wonder who will be next.</p>

<p>Last week Prothean Systems <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/2528744020845660">announced they’d surpassed AGI</a> and <a href="https://www.beprothean.org/TECHNICAL_WHITE_PAPER#9-conclusion">called for the research community</a> to “verify, critique, extend, and improve upon” their work. Unfortunately, Prothean Systems has not published the repository they say researchers should use to verify their claims. However, based on their posts, web site, and public GitHub repositories, I can offer a few basic critiques.</p>

              <p>A few months back I wound up concluding, <a href="https://blog.woof.group/announcements/updates-on-the-osa">based on conversations with Ofcom</a>, that aphyr.com might be illegal in the UK due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Safety_Act_2023">UK Online Safety Act</a>. I wrote <a href="https://aphyr.com/posts/379-geoblocking-the-uk-with-debian-nginx">a short tutorial</a> on geoblocking a single country using Nginx on Debian.</p>


<p>Now Mississippi’s 2024 HB 1126 has made it illegal for essentially any web site to know a user’s e-mail address, or other “personal identifying information”, unless that site also takes steps to "verify the age of the person creating an account”. Bluesky <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/08-22-2025-mississippi-hb1126">wound up geoblocking Mississippi</a>. Over on a small forum I help run, we paid our lawyers to look into HB 1126, and the conclusion was that we were <a href="https://blog.woof.group/announcements/woof-group-will-block-mississippi">likely in the same boat</a>. Collecting email addresses put us in scope of the bill, and it wasn’t clear whether the LLC would shield officers (hi) from personal liability.</p>


<p>This blog has the same problem: people use email addresses to post and confirm their comments. I think my personal blog is probably at low risk, but a.) I’d like to draw attention to this legislation, and b.) my risk is elevated by being gay online, and having written and called a whole bunch of Mississippi legislators about HB 1126. Long story short, I’d like to block both a country <em>and</em> an individual state. Here’s how:</p>

              <p>In the hopes that it saves someone else two hours later: the ISP <a href="https://www.astound.com/">Astound</a> only supports IPv6 in Washington State. You might find <a href="https://www.astound.com/support/internet/symmetrical/">this page</a> which says “Astound supports IPv6 in most locations”. Their tech support agents might tell you that they support v6 on your connection, even if you are not in Washington. “Yes, we do support both DHCPv6 and SLAAC”, they might say, and tell you to use a prefix delegation size of 60. If you are staring at <code>tcpdump</code> and wondering why you’re not seeing anything coming back from your router’s plaintive requests for address information, it is because they do not, in fact, support v6 anywhere but Washington.</p>

              <p>In my free time, I help run a small Mastodon server for roughly six hundred queer leatherfolk. When a new member signs up, we require them to write a short application—just a sentence or two. There’s a small text box in the signup form which says:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Please tell us a bit about yourself and your connection to queer leather/kink/BDSM. What kind of play or gear gets you going?</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This serves a few purposes. First, it maintains community focus. Before this question, we were flooded with signups from straight, vanilla people who wandered in to the bar (so to speak), and that made things a little awkward. Second, the application establishes a baseline for people willing and able to read text. This helps in getting people to follow server policy and talk to moderators when needed. Finally, it is <em>remarkably</em> effective at keeping out spammers. In almost six years of operation, we’ve had only a handful of spam accounts.</p>

              <p>I’ve been involved in content moderation since roughly 2004. I’ve built spam prevention for corporate and personal e-mail, moderated open-source mailing lists and IRC channels, worked at a couple social media networks, and help moderate a Mastodon instance for a few hundred people. In the last few years I’ve wasted more time fighting blog comment spam, and I’m pretty sure Large Language Models (LLMs) are to blame.</p>


<p>I think of spam as a space with multiple equilibria. Producing spam takes work. Spammers are willing to invest that work because each message has a small chance to make money, or achieve political or emotional goals. Some spam, like the endless identical Viagra scams in my email spam folder, or the PHPBB comment spam I filter out here on aphyr.com, is cheap to generate and easy to catch. I assume the spammers make it up in volume. Other spam, like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/spear-phishing">spear phishing attacks</a>, is highly time-consuming: the spammer must identify a target, carefully craft a plausible message using, say, the identity of the target’s co-workers, or construct a facade of a bank’s log-in page, and so on. This kind of spam is more likely to make it through filters, but because it takes a lot of human work, is generally only worth it for high-value targets.</p>


<p>LLMs seem to be changing these equilibria. Over the last year I’ve seen a new class of comment spam, using what I’m fairly sure is LLM-generated text. These comments make specific, plausible remarks about the contents of posts and images, and work in a link to some web site or mention a product. Take this one I caught a few months back:</p>

I’m happy to hear it!</em></p>


<p><a href="https://www.truenas.com/">TrueNAS</a> makes file servers, also known as Network Attached Storage (NAS). I bought one of their smaller boxes to house backups, and it’s a great little NAS. For many years TrueNAS sold boxes with a BSD-based operating system, but in the last few years they’ve released a new, Linux-backed operating system called <a href="https://www.truenas.com/truenas-scale/">TrueNAS SCALE</a>, also called “Community Edition”. I was considering migrating to TrueNAS SCALE, but the docs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250408163343/https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/gettingstarted/migrate/migrate-community/">started off with this warning</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>TrueNAS Enterprise customers should consult with TrueNAS Enterprise Support before attempting migrate.</p>
<p>The process requires an extended maintenance window, requires executing steps in the correct order to prevent issues with system configuration and operation, and additional system review post-migration to catch and correct any configuration issues.</p>

<p><em>I subscribe to the Chicago Sun-Times, a non-profit newspaper. This week they sent me a sixty-four page special insert, branded with the Chicago Sun-Times logo, full of LLM nonsense. Yesterday I wrote the following letter to the Chicago Sun-Times.

              <p>Back in 2023 I went through an inter-state move with <a href="https://www.flatrate.com/moving/">Flat Rate Movers,
LTD.</a>, a.k.a. Flat Rate Moving, US DOT 488466, MC 254356. They bungled the job, damaged my stuff
and my house, and then refused to talk to me or their own insurance company. I
placed dozens of calls, wrote letters, emails, nothing worked. I finally got
some money for the damage by working with their insurer directly. I know a lot
of folks struggle with moving companies, and figured I’d write up a bit of this
story in case it helps. You can <a href="#finding-their-insurance">skip ahead</a> if you
just want to know about the FMCSA insurer database.</p>


<p>In November 2022 I scheduled the move with Flat Rate. We took a detailed video
inventory of everything to be moved. I paid over $14,000 for an “all inclusive
move”, which, per the move plan, included full packing services, blankets for furniture, boxes for electronics, lamps, and bicycles, a custom crate for a tabletop, and “extended valuation coverage”—their insurance policy.</p>


<p>A few days before the move in March 2023, Flat Rate called to tell me a
five-person team would arrive. When the crew arrived, it wasn’t Flat Rate. It
was a team of two from <a href="https://www.esquiremoving.com/">Esquire Moving Inc</a> (US DOT 2820253, MC 940499). They had
no idea they were supposed to provide packing services. The crate I paid for was nowhere to be found. They didn’t have enough boxes or blankets. I had to have everything out that day, so
there wasn’t any choice—I worked alongside the team for thirteen hours to
complete the packing and move-out.</p>

              <p><em>Submitted to the Department of State, which is <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/18/2025-02696/30-day-notice-of-proposed-information-collection-application-for-a-us-passport-for-eligible">requesting comments</a> on a proposed change which would align US passport gender markers with <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/">executive order 14168</a>.</em></p>


<p>Executive order 14168 is biologically incoherent and socially cruel. All passport applicants should be allowed to select whatever gender markers they feel best fit, including M, F, or X.</p>


<p>In humans, neither sex nor gender is binary at any level. There are several possible arrangements of sex chromosomes: X, XX, XY, XXY, XYY, XXX, tetrasomies, pentasomies, etc. A single person can contain a mosaic of cells with different genetics: some XX, some XYY. Chromosomes may not align with genitalia: people with XY chromosomes may have a vulva and internal testes. People with XY chromosomes and a small penis may be surgically and socially reassigned female at birth—and never told what happened. None of these biological dimensions necessarily align with one’s internal concept of gender, or one’s social presentation.</p>

              <p>A few quick notes for other folks who are <a href="https://geoblockthe.uk/">geoblocking the UK</a>. I just set up a basic geoblock with Nginx on Debian. This is all stuff you can piece together, but the Maxmind and Nginx docs are a little vague about the details, so I figure it’s worth an actual writeup. My Nginx expertise is ~15 years out of date, so this might not be The Best Way to do things. YMMV.</p>


<p>First, register for a free <a href="https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup">MaxMind account</a>; you’ll need this to subscribe to their GeoIP database. Then set up a daemon to maintain a copy of the lookup file locally, and Nginx’s GeoIP2 module:</p>


<pre><code><span></span>apt install geoipupdate libnginx-mod-http-geoip2

              <p>This is not at all news, but it comes up often enough that I think there should be a concise explanation of the problem. People, myself included, like to say that POSIX time, also known as Unix time, is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date">number</a> <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/Seconds-since-the-Epoch.html">of</a> <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/time.2.html">seconds</a> <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/time#Unix">since</a> <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/datetime.html">the</a> <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.0/Time.html">Unix</a> <a href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql-oss/3.x/cql/cql_reference/timestamp_type_r.html">epoch</a>, which was 1970-01-01 at 00:00:00.</p>


<p>This is not true. Or rather, it isn’t true in the sense most people think. For example, it is presently 2024-12-25 at 18:51:26 UTC. The POSIX time is 1735152686. It has been 1735152713 seconds since the POSIX epoch. The POSIX time number is twenty-seven seconds lower.</p>


<p>This is because POSIX time is derived <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/FIPS/fipspub151-1.pdf">in IEEE 1003.1</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">Coordinated Universal Time</a>. The standard assumes that every day is exactly 86,400 seconds long. Specifically:</p>

<p>The world’s largest cargo sailboat, Neoliner Origin, completed its first transatlantic voyage on 30 October despite damage to one of its sails during the journey.</p>
<p>The 136-metre-long vessel had to rely partly on its auxiliary motor and its remaining sail after the aft sail was damaged in a storm shortly after departure.</p>
<p>The French-built roll-on/roll-off (RoRo) cargo ship, which has two semi-rigid sails, first stopped at Saint Pierre and Miquelon, a French overseas territory near Canada, before continuing its journey to Baltimore in the United States.</p>
<p>Neoline, the company behind the project, said the damage reduced the vessel’s ability to perform fully on wind power. The company’s CEO, Jean Zanuttini, said the crossing was a valuable experience in handling large sail surfaces across the North Atlantic, especially during late-season storms. He added that despite the difficulties, the ship showed strong resilience by reaching its destination with only a short delay in Saint Pierre.</p>
<p>The Neoliner Origin is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 to 90 per cent compared to conventional diesel-powered cargo ships. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), global shipping produces about 3 per cent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Zanuttini said the company aims to balance industrial needs with environmental responsibility. He added that wind propulsion offers an advantage because it is a free, widely available, and predictable energy source that does not harm ecosystems.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1877759" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1877759"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.marineinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cargo-Sailboat.jpg" alt="Cargo Sailboat" width="1200" height="628" srcset="https://www.marineinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cargo-Sailboat.jpg 1200w, https://www.marineinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cargo-Sailboat-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.marineinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cargo-Sailboat-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://www.marineinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cargo-Sailboat-768x402.jpg 768w, https://www.marineinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cargo-Sailboat-150x79.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1877759">Image Credits: NEOLINE/LinkedIn</figcaption></figure>
<p>The UK’s National Clean Maritime Research Hub has reported that wind propulsion systems like those on the Neoliner Origin can cut emissions by over 50 per cent on new vessels optimised for wind conditions. Retrofitted vessels can also achieve reductions of 5 to 20 per cent, and up to 30 per cent when adjusted for wind conditions.</p>
<p>The Neoliner Origin was designed by the French naval engineering firm Mauric. The company’s CEO, Vincent Seguin, said the goal was to develop a ship that relies primarily on wind propulsion while ensuring consistent delivery schedules and efficient operation with a smaller crew.</p>
<p>Inspired by historic sailing vessels, the Neoliner Origin integrates modern systems such as advanced navigation, anti-drift mechanisms, and automated sail management to comply with current safety and operational standards.</p>
<p>The ship can carry up to 5,300 tonnes of cargo, including containers, vehicles, machinery, and specialised goods. It arrived in Baltimore carrying Renault vehicles, French liqueurs, machinery, and other products.</p>
<p>The Neoliner Origin is scheduled to make monthly voyages between Europe and North America, maintaining a commercial cruising speed of around 11 knots.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I want you to understand what it is to live in Chicago.</p>
<p>Every day my phone buzzes. It is a neighborhood group: four people were
kidnapped at the corner drugstore. A friend a mile away sends a Slack message:
she was at the scene when masked men assaulted and abducted two people on the
street. A plumber working on my pipes is distraught, and I find out that two of his
employees were kidnapped that morning. A week later it happens again.</p>
<p>An email arrives. Agents with guns <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/11/05/daycare-teacher-taken-by-ice-north-side-immigration">have chased a teacher</a> into the school where she
works. They did not have a warrant. They dragged her away, ignoring her and her colleagues’ pleas to show proof of her documentation. That evening I stand a few feet from the parents of Rayito de Sol and listen to them describe, with anguish, how good
Ms. Diana was to their children. What it is like to have <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/video-shows-ice-agents-grabbing-202310296.html">strangers with guns
traumatize your
kids</a>.
For a teacher to hide a three-year-old child <a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/chicago/2025/11/05/daycare-worker-pulled-out-of-school-by-armed-federal-agents-traumatizing-parents-say/">for fear they might be
killed</a>.
How their relatives will no longer leave the house. I hear the pain and fury in
their voices, and I wonder who will be next.</p>
<p>Understand what it is to pray in Chicago. On September 19th, Reverend David Black, lead pastor at First Presbyterian Church of Chicago, was <a href="https://wgntv.com/news/chicago-news/i-wonder-about-their-intentions-chicago-pastor-speaks-out-after-ice-agents-shoot-him-in-head-with-pepper-balls-in-broadview/">praying outside the ICE detention center in Broadview</a> when a DHS agent <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/reverend-shot-by-ice-shares-chilling-warning-after-being-left-with-dent-in-his-head/ar-AA1PHXPe">shot him in the head with pepper balls</a>. Pepper balls are <a href="https://store-c19drjba2a.mybigcommerce.com/content/PEP-22018-TRP-LE-Manual-042423.pdf">never supposed to be fired at the head</a> because they can seriously injure or even kill. “We could hear them laughing as they were shooting us from the roof,” Black recalled. He is not the only member of the clergy ICE has assaulted. Methodist pastor Hannah Kardon was violently arrested <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eARiC31koHo">on October 17th</a>, and Baptist pastor Michael Woolf was shot with pepper balls <a href="https://wordandway.org/2025/11/04/baptist-pastor-shot-in-leg-by-officer-during-all-saints-day-march-outside-ice-facility/">on November 1st</a>.</p>
<p>Understand what it is to sleep in Chicago. On the night of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/24/nx-s1-5570113/chicago-south-shore-building-residents-recount-humiliating-ice-raid">September
30th</a>,
federal agents rappelled from a Black Hawk helicopter to execute a raid on an apartment
building on the South Shore. Roughly three hundred agents deployed flashbangs,
busted down doors, and took people indiscriminately. US citizens, including
women and children, were grabbed from their beds, marched outside without even
a chance to dress, zip-tied, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFh5yBIxTpc">loaded into
vans</a>. Residents returned to <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/10/02/south-shore-residents-return-to-ransacked-apartments-try-to-move-out-after-ice-raid-it-looks-like-hell/">find
their windows and doors broken</a> and their belongings
stolen.</p>
<p>Understand what it is to lead Chicago. On October 3rd, Alderperson Jesse Fuentes <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/10/15/ald-jesse-fuentes-gears-up-to-sue-after-being-handcuffed-by-ice-agent/">asked federal agents</a> to produce a judicial warrant and allow an injured man at the hospital access to an attorney. The plainclothes agents grabbed Fuentes, handcuffed her, and took her outside the building. Her lawsuit <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2025/10/21/ald-jessie-fuentes-tort-claim-ice-agents-humboldt-park">is ongoing</a>. On October 21st, Representative Hoan Huynh was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/illinois-state-rep-hoan-huynh-border-patrol-agents-gun-drawn/">going door-to-door</a> to inform businesses of their immigration rights when he was attacked by six armed CBP agents, who boxed in his vehicle and pointed a gun at his face. Huynh says the agents <a href="https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/chicago-lawmaker-stopped-gunpoint">tried to bash open his car window</a>.</p>
<p>Understand what it is to live in Chicago. On October 9th, Judge Ellis issued a <a href="https://www.nprillinois.org/chicago-il/2025-10-09/judge-grants-restraining-order-protecting-protesters-journalists-in-chicago-area-protests">temporary restraining
order</a>
requiring that federal agents refrain from deploying tear gas or shooting
civilians without an imminent threat, and requiring two audible warnings. ICE
and CBP have flaunted these court orders. On October 12th, federal agents
<a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/12/ice-chicago-albany-park-tear-gas">shoved an attorney to the
ground</a>
who tried to help a man being detained in Albany Park. Agents refused to
identify themselves or produce a warrant, then deployed tear gas without
warning. On October 14th, agents rammed a car on the East Side, then
<a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/10/14/ice-deploys-tear-gas-after-crash/">tear-gassed neighbors and
police</a>.</p>
<p>On October 23rd, federal agents <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/10/22/border-patrol-agents-descend-on-little-village-sparking-fury-fear-in-neighborhood/">detained seven
people</a>,
including two U.S. citizens and an asylum seeker, in Little Village. Two worked
for Alderperson Michael Rodriguez: his chief of staff Elianne Bahena, and
police district council member Jacqueline Lopez. Again in Little Village, agents <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/10/23/immigration-agents-protesters-clash-in-little-village-for-2nd-day-in-a-row/">tear-gassed and pepper-sprayed protestors</a>, seizing two high school students and a security guard, among others. Alderperson Byron Sigcho-Lopez reported that agents assaulted one of the students, who had blood on his face. On October 24th, agents in
Lakeview emerged from unmarked cars, climbed a locked fence to enter a
private yard, and <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/10/24/lakeview-street-tear-gassed-by-agents-amid-north-side-immigration-surge-it-hit-home/">kidnapped a construction
worker</a>.
As neighbors gathered, they deployed four tear gas canisters. That same day, a few blocks away,
men with rifles jumped out of SUVs and <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/10/24/lakeview-street-tear-gassed-by-agents-amid-north-side-immigration-surge-it-hit-home/">assaulted a man standing at a bus
stop</a>.</p>
<p>“They were beating him,” said neighbor Hannah Safter. “His face was bleeding”.</p>
<p>They returned minutes later and attacked again. A man from the Laugh Factory, a
local comedy club, had come outside with his mother and sister. “His mom put
her body in between them, and one of the agents kicked her in the face”.</p>
<p>Understand what it is to raise a family in Chicago. The next day, October 25th, federal agents <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/chicago-immigration-enforcement-children-tear-gas-border-patrol-rcna241629">tear-gassed
children</a>
in Old Irving Park. Again, no warnings were heard. On October 26th, agents
arrested a 70-year-old man and <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/10/26/federal-agents-use-tear-gas-again-this-time-in-northwest-side-confrontations/">threw a 67-year old woman to the
ground</a>
in Old Irving Park, then tear-gassed neighbors in Avondale. That same day, federal agents <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/border-patrol-agents-fire-allegedly-disrupting-childrens-halloween/story?id=126900354">deployed tear gas at a children’s Halloween parade</a> in Old Irving Park.</p>
<p>“Kids dressed in Halloween costumes walking to a parade do not pose an immediate threat to the safety of a law enforcement officer. They just don’t. And you can’t use riot control weapons against them,” <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/10/28/after-halloween-parade-ruined-by-federal-agents-old-irving-park-neighbors-furious/">Judge Ellis said</a> to Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino.</p>
<p>Understand how the government speaks about Chicago. On November 3rd, paralegal Dayanne Figueroa, a US citizen, was driving to work when federal agents <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/11/03/chicago-woman-collision-ice-accountability/">crashed into her car</a>, drew their guns, and dragged her from the vehicle. Her car was left behind, coffee still in the cup holder, keys still in the car. The Department of Homeland Security blamed her, claiming she “violently resisted arrest, injuring two officers.” You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLozt6ThXfE">watch the video for yourself</a>.</p>
<p>“All uses of force have been more than exemplary,” Bovino <a href="https://wgntv.com/news/operation-midway-blitz/judge-border-patrol-commander-lied-about-use-of-force/">stated in a recent deposition</a>. He is, as Judge Ellis put it, lying. Bovino <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/border-patrol-commander-admitted-lied-tear-gas-incident/story?id=127283392">personally threw a tear gas canister in Little Village</a>. He claimed <a href="https://wgntv.com/news/operation-midway-blitz/judge-border-patrol-commander-lied-about-use-of-force/">in a sworn deposition</a> that he was struck in the head by a rock before throwing the canister, and when videos showed no rock, <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/public-safety/2025/11/04/plaintiffs-lawyers-bovino-views-protesters-as-violent-rioters-tells-officers-to-go-hard-against-them">admitted that he lied</a> about the event. When shown video of himself <a href="https://wgntv.com/news/operation-midway-blitz/judge-border-patrol-commander-lied-about-use-of-force/">tackling peaceful protestor Scott Blackburn</a>, Bovino refused to acknowledge that he tackled the man. Instead, he claimed, “That’s not a reportable use of force. The use of force was against me.”</p>
<p>“I find the government’s evidence to be simply not credible,” <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/11/06/operation-midway-blitz-injunction/">said Judge Ellis</a> in her November 6th ruling. “The use of force shocks the conscience.”</p>
<p>Understand what it is to be Chicago. To <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/10/15/hundreds-pack-chicago-whistlemania-events-in-effort-to-fight-ice-we-have-to-stand-up-for-one-another/">carry a whistle</a> and have the <a href="https://www.icirr.org/fsn">ICIRR hotline</a> in your phone. To wake up from nightmares about shouting militiamen pointing guns at your face. To rehearse every day how to calmly refuse entry, how to identify a judicial warrant, how to film and narrate an assault. To wake to helicopters buzzing your home, to feel your heart rate spike at the car horns your neighbors use to alert each other to ICE and CBP enforcement. To know that perhaps three thousand of your fellow Chicagoans have <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/investigations/could-ice-have-lost-3000-immigrant-arrestees-in-chicago/3844220/">been disappeared</a> by the government, but <a href="https://www.wbez.org/immigration/2025/09/12/immigration-customs-enforcement-ice-arrests-detentions-data-deportation-project-trac">no one really knows for sure</a>. To know that many of those seized were imprisoned a few miles away, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/judge-calls-alleged-conditions-at-chicago-area-immigration-site-disgusting">as many as a hundred and fifty people in a cell</a>, denied access to food, water, sanitation, and legal representation. To know that many of these agents—masked, without badge numbers or body cams, and refusing to identify themselves—will never face justice. To wonder what they tell their children.</p>
<p>The masked thugs who attack my neighbors, who point guns at elected officials and shoot pastors with pepper balls, who tear-gas neighborhoods, terrify children, and drag teachers and alderpeople away in handcuffs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel">are not unprecedented</a>. We knew this was coming a year ago, when <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/12/nx-s1-5181962/trump-promises-a-mass-deportation-on-day-1-what-might-that-look-like">Trump promised mass deportations</a>. We knew it was coming, and seventy-seven million of us voted for it anyway.</p>
<p>This weight presses upon me every day. I am flooded with stories. There are so many I cannot remember them all; cannot keep straight who was gassed, beaten, abducted, or shot. I write to leave a record, to stare at the track of the tornado which tears through our city. I write to leave a warning. I write to call for help.</p>
<p>I want you to understand, regardless of your politics, the historical danger of a secret police. What happens when a militia is deployed in our neighborhoods and against our own people. Left unchecked, their mandate will grow; the boundaries of acceptable identity and speech will shrink. I want you to think about elections in this future. I want you to understand that every issue you care about—any hope of participatory democracy—is downstream of this.</p>
<p>I want you to understand what it is to love Chicago. To see your neighbors make the heartbreaking choice between showing up for work or staying safe. To <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/10/18/thousands-gather-to-protest-trump-at-chicagos-no-kings-rally-downtown/">march two miles long</a>, calling out: “This is what Chicago sounds like!” To see your representatives put <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWuIONYSwhA">their bodies on the line</a> and their <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/chicago-daycare-worker-rayito-de-sol-arrested-ice-front-children-witnesses-say/18116866/">voices in the fight</a>. To <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/10/08/chicago-neighbors-are-forming-watches-near-schools-to-protect-students-guardians-from-ice/">form patrols</a> to walk kids safely to school. To join <a href="https://dailynorthwestern.com/2025/11/05/city/icirr-eyes-on-ice-text-network-alerts-community-to-verified-federal-immigration-enforcement-activity/">rapid-response networks</a> to document and alert your neighbors to immigration attacks. For mutual aid networks to <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/11/05/from-chicago-to-la-neighborly-solidarity-fuels-resistance-to-ice/">deliver groceries</a> and <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/10/17/chicago-cyclists-are-buying-out-tamale-carts-to-keep-vendors-home-and-safe-from-ice/">buy out street vendors</a> so they can go home safe. To see your local journalists <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/10/07/block-club-chicago-news-organizations-sue-feds-over-first-amendment-violations/">take the federal government to court</a>. To talk to neighbor after neighbor, friend after friend, and hear yes, yes, it’s all hands on deck.</p>
<p>I want you to understand Chicago.</p>

<p><span><a href="http://iotic.com/"><img src="http://iotic.com/averia/img/first-letter-replace.png"></a></span><span>am not a type designer. <span>T</span>his is the story of the creation</span> of a new font,
Avería: the average of all the fonts on my computer. The field of typography
has long fascinated me, and I love playing with creative programming
ideas, so it was perhaps inevitable that the idea came to me one day of
“generative typography”. A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=generative+typography">Google</a> on the subject brought up little, and I 
put the idea to the back of my mind until it occurred to me that perhaps the process of
averaging, or interpolating, existing fonts might bring up interesting results. Luckily at this
point I didn't do any more web searching – instead I grabbed
my laptop and came up with an initial idea for finding what the average of all
my fonts might look like – by overlaying each letter at low opacity. The results
can be seen in the below image.<br>
<a href="http://iotic.com/averia/img/all-big.jpg"><img src="http://iotic.com/averia/img/fig1b.png" alt="&nbsp;" title="Click to enlarge"></a>
<!--<img src="img/fig1b.png" style="display:block;margin:35px auto;" />-->
</p>

<p>This was done by printing each letter of each font, at the same point size,
to lots of separate images, and then averaging them – using <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a> and <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>.
The letters were
aligned to the same centre point. I later realised that each font has a <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/glossary.php?ltr=b">‘baseline’</a> defined, and
an <a href="http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/glyphs/glyphs-3.html">origin</a> on that baseline which each glyph is drawn relative to. The same process,
repeated with equal origins, gives slightly different results (see below) – here
you can see the baseline is very well-defined, with the glyphs becoming more blurred towards the top right of each.<br>
<a href="http://iotic.com/averia/img/same-origin-big.jpg"><img src="http://iotic.com/averia/img/fig2b.png" alt="&nbsp;" title="Click to enlarge"></a>
<!--<img src="img/fig2b.png" style="display:block;margin:35px auto;" />-->
</p>

<p>I was quite pleased with the results. It was only later that I discovered
<a href="http://www.moritzresl.net/average-font/">this had already been done</a> – though it appeared that my end results (whilst not as beautifully animated) had a little
more clarity, so I'm glad I tried for myself. But this didn't seem like the end of
the journey. Whilst this was an  interesting experiment, and showed an lot of
correlation between a sample of common fonts (as well as a
couple of oddities – notably the lower case ‘g’ which clearly exists in two
distinct common forms), what I really wanted was an average which somehow
preserved the well-defined edges of existing fonts. So I started considering ways to
produce a smoother, sharper average of letter forms.</p>

<p>One idea which seemed obvious was to simply take the blurry results of the
first experiment, and use a threshold to create monochrome images. A few experiments in this
direction (I first tried with a lower-case ‘f’, which I later found was never
likely to give good results due to the variance in height of the middle
cross-stroke) convinced me that I needed to look into cleverer ways to achieve
this<!-- footnote? this could go further -->.
Surely there must be a simple way to average shapes, while keeping the result as a
shape?<br>
<img src="http://iotic.com/averia/img/f-thresh.png"><a href="http://iotic.com/averia/img/threshold-big.png"><img src="http://iotic.com/averia/img/all-threshold-200.png" alt="&nbsp;" title="Click to enlarge"></a>
<a href="http://iotic.com/averia/img/gradient-map-big.jpg"></a>
<!--<img src="img/all-threshold-200.png" style="margin:35px 0 35px 44px;" />-->
</p>

<p>It turns out not to be straightforward. There are <a href="http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~bloch/P6/IREC/LNCS2005.pdf">many</a> <a href="http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~dcor/online_papers/papers/arap.pdf">possible</a>
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.85.6766&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">ways</a> to ‘morph’ between two shapes – and what might seem the most natural
generally depends on our perception of ‘features’ in the shapes. Consider the
average of a capital I with serifs, and one without: the natural thing to do
would be something like, make the serifs half as big, and use a horizontal stem
width about half-way between the two glyphs. That's two feature concepts being
applied to the abstract forms<a href="#f1" id="fl1">¹</a>. To take a simpler example, what is the
average of a square with the same square rotated 45˚? There are a few
possibilities …<br>
<img src="http://iotic.com/averia/img/avg-i.png">
<img src="http://iotic.com/averia/img/avg-sq.png">
</p>

<p>So, this stumped me for a while. I decided I needed to get to know fonts
better, so I built <a href="http://iotic.com/averia/spell/">a simple web app</a> to view the lines, curves and control points
present in the fonts I had. On this basis, I started to consider the ways the
features (vertices, curves, stems, serifs etc) might be matched up between fonts.
However, this was a rabbit hole I might never get to the bottom of -
particularly when considering some of the more unusual varieties of font.
Perhaps there was a simpler idea that was evading me.<br>
<a href="http://iotic.com/averia/img/casamp-big.png"><img src="http://iotic.com/averia/img/casamp.png" alt="&nbsp;" title="Click to enlarge"></a><!--img src="img/casamp.png" style="display:block;margin:35px auto;" /-->
</p>

<p>Then it occurred to me: since my aim was to average a large number of fonts,
perhaps it would be best to use a very simple process, and hope the results
averaged out well over a large number of fonts. So, how about splitting each 
letter perimeter into lots of (say, 500) equally-spaced points, and just average
between the corresponding positions of each, on each letter? It would be necessary to match up the points so
they were about the same location in each letter, and then the process would be
fairly simple<a href="#f2" id="fl2">²</a>.</p>

<p>Having found a simple process to use, I was ready to start. And after about a month of
part-time slaving away (sheer fun! Better than any computer game) – in the
process of which I learned lots about bezier curves and font metrics – I had a
result. I call it Avería – which is a Spanish word related to <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/?term=average">the root of the
word ‘average’</a>. It actually means mechanical breakdown or damage. This seemed curiously fitting, and I was
assured by a Spanish friend-of-a-friend that “Avería is an incredibly beautiful
word regardless of its meaning”. So that's nice.</p>

<div><p>Along the way I naturally called on the counsel of the best designers
I know – my brother <a href="http://www.nicksayers.com/">Nick Sayers</a>, <a href="http://www.domh.net/">Lloyd Thomas</a>, <a href="http://www.hellomuller.com/">Tom Muller</a> and
<a href="http://kleber.net/">Chris McGrail</a>, for
advice. In the end, I decided to release the font using the <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;id=OFL">SIL Open Font
License</a> – which means anyone can use it pretty much however they like – and to
include within the family Regular, Bold and Light variants with Italics. Each is
made from the corresponding subsets of the fonts on my machine. Also
included is a “<em>Gruesa</em>” version made from all my fonts (725 in total).</p><p>

												<p>For the past week, domains associated with the massive <strong>Aisuru</strong> botnet have repeatedly usurped <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>Apple</strong>, <strong>Google</strong> and <strong>Microsoft</strong> in Cloudflare’s public ranking of the most frequently requested websites. Cloudflare responded by redacting Aisuru domain names from their top websites list. The chief executive at Cloudflare says Aisuru’s overlords are using the botnet to boost their malicious domain rankings, while simultaneously attacking the company’s domain name system (DNS) service.</p>
<div id="attachment_72541"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72541" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CFRadar-Aisuru-redacted.png" alt="" width="747" height="529" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CFRadar-Aisuru-redacted.png 1140w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CFRadar-Aisuru-redacted-768x544.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CFRadar-Aisuru-redacted-782x554.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CFRadar-Aisuru-redacted-100x70.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-72541">The #1 and #3 positions in this chart are Aisuru botnet controllers with their full domain names redacted. Source: radar.cloudflare.com.</p></div>
<p>Aisuru is a rapidly growing botnet comprising hundreds of thousands of hacked Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as poorly secured Internet routers and security cameras. The botnet has <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased in size and firepower significantly since its debut in 2024</a>, demonstrating the ability <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to launch record distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks</a> nearing 30 terabits of data per second.</p>
<p>Until recently, Aisuru’s malicious code instructed all infected systems to use DNS servers from Google — specifically, the servers at 8.8.8.8. But in early October, Aisuru switched to invoking Cloudflare’s main DNS server — 1.1.1.1 — and over the past week domains used by Aisuru to control infected systems started populating Cloudflare’s top domain rankings.</p>
<p>As screenshots of Aisuru domains claiming two of the Top 10 positions ping-ponged across social media, many feared this was yet another sign that an already untamable botnet was running completely amok. One Aisuru botnet domain that sat prominently for days at #1 on the list was someone’s street address in Massachusetts followed by “.com”. Other Aisuru domains mimicked those belonging to major cloud providers.</p>
<p>Cloudflare tried to address these security, brand confusion and privacy concerns by partially redacting the malicious domains, and adding a warning at the top of its rankings:</p>
<p>“Note that the top 100 domains and trending domains lists include domains with organic activity as well as domains with emerging malicious behavior.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/cfradar-warning.png" alt="" width="675" height="466" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/cfradar-warning.png 613w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/cfradar-warning-100x70.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px"></p>
<p>Cloudflare CEO <strong>Matthew Prince</strong> told KrebsOnSecurity the company’s domain ranking system is fairly simplistic, and that it merely measures the volume of DNS queries to 1.1.1.1.</p>
<p>“The attacker is just generating a ton of requests, maybe to influence the ranking but also to attack our DNS service,” Prince said, adding that Cloudflare has heard reports of other large public DNS services seeing similar uptick in attacks. “We’re fixing the ranking to make it smarter. And, in the meantime, redacting any sites we classify as malware.”<span id="more-72528"></span></p>
<p><strong>Renee Burton</strong>, vice president of threat intel at the DNS security firm <strong>Infoblox</strong>, said many people erroneously assumed that the skewed Cloudflare domain rankings meant there were more bot-infected devices than there were regular devices querying sites like Google and Apple and Microsoft.</p>
<p>“Cloudflare’s documentation is clear — they know that when it comes to ranking domains you have to make choices on how to normalize things,” Burton <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7391657470152228864/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on <strong>LinkedIn</strong>. “There are many aspects that are simply out of your control. Why is it hard? Because reasons. TTL values, caching, prefetching, architecture, load balancing. Things that have shared control between the domain owner and everything in between.”</p>
<p><strong>Alex Greenland</strong> is CEO of the anti-phishing and security firm <strong>Epi</strong>. Greenland said he understands the technical reason why Aisuru botnet domains are showing up in Cloudflare’s rankings (those rankings are based on DNS query volume, not actual web visits). But he said they’re still not meant to be there.</p>
<p>“It’s a failure on Cloudflare’s part, and reveals a compromise of the trust and integrity of their rankings,” he said.</p>
<p>Greenland said Cloudflare planned for its Domain Rankings to list the most popular domains as used by human users, and it was never meant to be a raw calculation of query frequency or traffic volume going through their 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver.</p>
<p>“They spelled out how their popularity algorithm is designed to reflect real human use and exclude automated traffic (they said they’re good at this),” Greenland <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7390787635759173632-pycT?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAliaMB3BQO-WOS-eUh-XU4HAd5h8pTzkI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on LinkedIn. “So something has evidently gone wrong internally. We should have two rankings: one representing trust and real human use, and another derived from raw DNS volume.”</p>
<p>Why might it be a good idea to wholly separate malicious domains from the list? Greenland notes that Cloudflare Domain Rankings see widespread use for trust and safety determination, by browsers, DNS resolvers, safe browsing APIs and things like <a href="https://tranco-list.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TRANCO</a>.</p>
<p>“TRANCO is a respected open source list of the top million domains, and Cloudflare Radar is one of their five data providers,” he continued. “So there can be serious knock-on effects when a malicious domain features in Cloudflare’s top 10/100/1000/million. To many people and systems, the top 10 and 100 are naively considered safe and trusted, even though algorithmically-defined top-N lists will always be somewhat crude.”</p>
<p>Over this past week, Cloudflare started redacting portions of the malicious Aisuru domains from its Top Domains list, leaving only their domain suffix visible. Sometime in the past 24 hours, Cloudflare appears to have begun hiding the malicious Aisuru domains entirely from the web version of that list. However, downloading a spreadsheet of the current Top 200 domains from Cloudflare Radar shows an Aisuru domain still at the very top.</p>
<p>According to Cloudflare’s website, the majority of DNS queries to the top Aisuru domains — nearly 52 percent — originated from the United States. This tracks with <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my reporting from early October</a>, which found Aisuru was drawing most of its firepower from IoT devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>, <strong>Comcast</strong> and <strong>Verizon</strong>.</p>
<p>Experts tracking Aisuru say the botnet relies on well more than a hundred control servers, and that for the moment at least most of those domains are registered in the .su top-level domain (TLD). Dot-su is the TLD assigned to the former Soviet Union (.su’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.su" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia page</a> says the TLD was created just 15 months before the fall of the Berlin wall).</p>
<p>A <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-tld-insights-on-cloudflare-radar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare blog post from October 27</a> found that .su had the highest “DNS magnitude” of any TLD, referring to a metric estimating the popularity of a TLD based on the number of unique networks querying Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 resolver. The report concluded that the top .su hostnames were associated with a popular online world-building game, and that more than half of the queries for that TLD came from the United States, Brazil and Germany [it’s worth noting that servers for the world-building game <strong>Minecraft</strong>&nbsp;were <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tcpshield-aisuru.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of Aisuru’s most frequent targets</a>].</p>
<p>A simple and crude way to detect Aisuru bot activity on a network may be to set an alert on any systems attempting to contact domains ending in .su. This TLD is frequently abused for cybercrime and by cybercrime forums and services, and blocking access to it entirely is unlikely to raise any legitimate complaints.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/07/unix_fourth_edition_tape_rediscovered/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/07/unix_fourth_edition_tape_rediscovered/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45857695">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A tape-based piece of unique Unix history may have been lying quietly in storage at the University of Utah for 50+ years. The question is whether researchers will be able to take this piece of middle-aged media and rewind it back to the 1970s to get the data off.</p>
<p>The news was <a href="https://discuss.systems/@ricci/115504720054699983" rel="nofollow">posted to Mastodon</a> by <a href="https://ricci.io/" rel="nofollow">Professor Robert Ricci</a> of the University of Utah's <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/" rel="nofollow">Kahlert School of Computing</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While cleaning a storage room, our staff found this tape containing #UNIX v4 from Bell Labs, circa 1973</p>

<p>Apparently no other complete copies are known to exist: <a href="https://gunkies.org/wiki/UNIX_Fourth_Edition" rel="nofollow">https://gunkies.org/wiki/UNIX_Fourth_Edition</a></p>

<p>We have arranged to deliver it to the Computer History Museum</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nine-track tape reel bears a handwritten label reading:</p>
<p>
  <strong>UNIX Original From Bell Labs V4 (See Manual for format)</strong>
</p>
<p>Ricci says that the handwriting on the label is that of his former advisor <a href="http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p45-v39n1j-andersen.pdf" rel="nofollow">Jay Lepreau</a> [PDF], who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031110707/http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/saltlaketribune/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&amp;pid=117597321" rel="nofollow">died of multiple myeloma in 2008</a>.</p>

    

<p>If it's what it says on the label, this is a notable discovery because <a href="https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V4" rel="nofollow">little of UNIX V4</a> remains. That's unfortunate as this specific version is especially interesting: it's the first version of UNIX in which the kernel and some of the core utilities were rewritten in the new C programming language. Until now, the only surviving parts known were the <a href="https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V4/nsys" rel="nofollow">source code</a> to a slightly older version of the kernel and a few <a href="https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V4/man" rel="nofollow"><code>man</code> pages</a> – plus the <a href="https://dspinellis.github.io/unix-v4man/v4man.pdf" rel="nofollow">Programmer's Manual</a> [PDF], from November 1973.</p>

        


        

<p>More was to follow – some hours later, <a href="https://discuss.systems/@ricci/115509057505895666" rel="nofollow">he continued</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have some more information on this! One of <a href="https://mastodon.social/@regehr" rel="nofollow">@regehr</a>'s <a href="https://cv.thalia.dev/" rel="nofollow">grad students</a> did some excellent sleuthing and figured out that this was received by Martin Newell: <a href="https://archive.org/details/unix_news_july-30-1975/page/n9/mode/2up" rel="nofollow">https://archive.org/details/unix_news_july-30-1975/page/n9/mode/2up</a></p>

<p>If that name sounds familiar to you, it's probably because his teapot is ubiquitous in computer graphics: <a href="https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/teapot/" rel="nofollow">https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/teapot/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, this is the original copy of UNIX Fourth Edition received from AT&amp;T by the inventor of the Utah Teapot – as seen in the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/13/windows_3d_pipes_screensaver/">original Windows NT OpenGL screensaver</a>.</p>

<p>That being the <a href="https://computerhistory.org/" rel="nofollow">Computer History Museum</a> in Mountain View, California – which Google Maps tells us is a mere 771 miles away, a modest 12 hours' drive. The software librarian at the CHM is the redoubtable <a href="https://terminals-wiki.org/wiki/index.php/BitSavers" rel="nofollow">Al Kossow of Bitsavers</a>, who <a href="https://oldbytes.space/@bitsavers/115505135441862982" rel="nofollow">commented</a> in the thread that he is on the case.

<blockquote>
<p>taping off the head read amplifier, using a multi-channel high speed analog to digital converter which dumps into 100-ish gigabytes of RAM, then an analysis program Len Shustek wrote: <a href="https://github.com/LenShustek/readtape" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/LenShustek/readtape</a></p>

<p>It is a '70s 1200ft 3M tape, likely 9 track, which has a pretty good chance of being recoverable.</p>

<p>He also <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2025-November/032764.html" rel="nofollow">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is rare enough that I'm pushing the recovery of it up near the top of my project queue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Reg</em> FOSS desk has occasionally corresponded with Kossow, and we feel sure that this precious find could be in no better hands. ®</p>

                <p>The market’s confidence in artificial intelligence may be wavering, and companies with big investments in it seem to be shedding supporters. The Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8c6e3c18-c5a0-4f60-bac4-fcdab6328bf8">notes that</a>, over the course of the past week, approximately $1 trillion in stock value has been wiped from several of Silicon Valley’s heaviest hitters, all of which are heavily enmeshed in generative AI. Those companies include Oracle, Meta, Palantir, and Nvidia, the outlet notes. The outlet calls it the worst week for Wall Street since Trump’s “<a href="https://gizmodo.com/trumps-tariffs-are-here-to-jack-up-the-price-of-your-switch-2-and-everything-else-2000584267">liberation day</a>.”</p> <p>The downturn in tech stocks isn’t contained to the industry’s biggest winners. There are also companies like Sweetgreen, the salad company that has tried to position itself as an automation company that serves salads on the side. Indeed, Sweetgreen has tried to dabble in a variety of tech, including AI and robots. However, that dream seems to have died, as the company recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-06/sweetgreen-to-sell-its-robotic-salad-making-unit-for-186-million">sold off its robotics division</a> to Wonder and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-wrong-sweetgreens-stock-093500386.html">its stock has been completely wiped out over the last year</a>.</p>

 <p>And then there’s Microsoft, which—despite being one of the most powerful and prominent companies in Silicon Valley—seems to be having one of its biggest losing streaks ever. Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-07/microsoft-eyes-longest-selloff-since-2011-as-ai-trade-weakens">reported</a> Friday that its stock had slumped 8.6 percent over eight days, a decline that evaporated some $350 billion in market valuation. That’s the company’s worst downturn since 2011, when the company’s stock saw losses for nine days straight, the outlet reports.</p>

 <p>At the heart of the stock stumbles, there appears to be a growing anxiety about the AI business, which is massively expensive to operate and doesn’t appear to be paying off in any concrete way. Bloomberg notes that Wall Street may be growing wary of the vast sums of money being poured into AI (Microsoft spent nearly $35 billion in expenditures during its last quarter) while profits remain elusive. Reporting on Microsoft’s stock slump, the outlet notes:</p>

 <blockquote><p>The stock hasn’t had a positive session since it reported its quarterly results in late October. While the report featured a number of positives, including better-than-expected growth in its Azure cloud—computing business, Wall Street is growing increasingly skeptical toward the huge sums that companies are spending to build out AI infrastructure.</p></blockquote> <p>At the same time, the tech slumps may be part of an overall shit-sandwich of an economy, with many available indicators (official economic data isn’t currently available due to the government shutdown) seeming to paint an increasingly dire picture. Indeed, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/october-layoffs-were-the-worst-since-2003-and-hit-tech-workers-hard-2000682936">a recent report</a> from career transition services firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas showed that job losses last month were the worst for October since 2003. Tech led those losses, with Amazon alone shedding some 14,000 jobs, the report showed.</p>

 <p>Want more evidence that our economy is currently a dumpster fire? A <a href="https://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/">monthly survey</a> from the University of Michigan has shown that consumer sentiment is currently hitting some of its lowest numbers in the history of the survey. “With the federal government shutdown dragging on for over a month, consumers are now expressing worries about potential negative consequences for the economy,” Joanne Hsu, the survey’s director, has said. “This month’s decline in sentiment was widespread throughout the population, seen across age, income, and political affiliation,” she added.</p> <p>In other words, we’re in the middle of the “<a href="https://fortune.com/2025/11/06/trump-claims-greatest-economy-miami-america-business-forum/">greatest economy</a>” ever. Yes, welcome to <a href="https://blog.dol.gov/2025/04/30/100-days-in-trumps-golden-age-puts-american-workers-first">the new “Golden Age”</a>, where the jobs are few and far between, everything is expensive, and there’s fear in the air! What a great place to be.</p>      </div>

You need to be your own Advocate. I want to help people become their own Advocate and put their heart health in their own hands.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a64803d9613d38bc3f53a49">In early 2023 during a routine skin check at my dermatologist, I uncovered a <!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>basal-cell carcinoma</span><!--/$-->. It’s a benign form of skin cancer. I freaked out. For the first time in my life I began to seriously think about my own mortality. I have two young children and I want to be there for them as they get old and be an engaged grandfather and all that amazing stuff. I don’t want to die young and have them grow up fatherless.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a64807ea5cec15350014af0">So I did the cliche thing every tech-entrepreneur-dude does: I signed up for a very expensive high-end concierge medicine service. This is an extraordinary privilege. I wanted to cover my bases, make sure nothing else was wrong with me, and do my best to understand how to stay healthy and protect against anything that could conceivably kill me while being relatively young. I wanted to control the things I could control.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a648083a399c0523bba0b9f">The first thing that this high-end concierge practice did was evaluate my heart health. I thought my heart was totally fine. Previously, I would visit my primary care physician (PCP) twice a year and get my bloodwork done annually. Here’s what my last <strong><!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>standard lipid panel</span><!--/$--></strong> (a standard <strong><!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>cardiometabolic</span><!--/$--></strong> test conducted by most physicians) from my PCP looked like:</p><p><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc5hn78ADnJaTq1W7Hs9wSs2JLtbU-cZqfLR3u5Sz-_WggN1uRAOnqjB0rgnwmeVP6gvoiwNysnaplrlE6DFMa592-acc-c12HYCcGJYR0uH_Pu5h5xvBJmujKrt9-HMBPSR3xm8XThFUq2W6BGpQncDusg?key=idWtkEjKUuoicTj4jSLZJw" alt="image" width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy"></p><p id="block-1449f34f2a6480d8946cc3cd35495cf3">The results told me my <strong><!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>LDL-C</span><!--/$--></strong> was fine, and my doctor said I didn’t need to take any additional preventative measures. I should simply maintain whatever it was I had been doing (e.g. exercising and eating somewhat healthy). This was from Forward Health - a tech-forward company that attempted to be a better version of One Medical. I shared these results with a leading lipidologist who proclaimed: “Not sure if the lab or the primary care doc said an LDL-C of 116 mg/dL was fine but that concentration is the 50th percentile population cut point in the MESA study and should never ever be considered as normal.”</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a6480c39fdedfb784860449">When I signed up for concierge medicine, the first thing they did was an extended lipid panel - a more extensive test that measures more important <strong><!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>biomarkers</span><!--/$--></strong> like <strong><!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>ApoB</span><!--/$--></strong> and <strong><!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>Lp(a)</span><!--/$--></strong>. I was shocked when my results came back:</p><div id="block-1449f34f2a6480d38063db35786f09a1"><p><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXePMJlNXxjnvTgRwG358H08VfCefoz7OGQEa9QWVdcC2DNMFoy1Am8GuiKRLc6H867NPGen6TDbkRxDgLGcDBk-rs8gYbvcE_GaEMykfUbYnXyxTWbualwd6BAL8hBHZM3pFTuDT33WOscaEIgA3fcII2Gz?key=idWtkEjKUuoicTj4jSLZJw" alt="The first rule of better care is to totally ignore the color which are inserted by labs to please customers.

The ranges they chose for degrees of risk are way out of date.</em></figcaption></div><p id="block-1449f34f2a6480f2b2cce840899e0c4c">I learned that my ApoB (Apoliproprotein B) is not good. (It’s also important to note that, according to a lipidologist friend, an ApoB of 96 is at a totally unacceptable 50th percentile population cutpoint from <!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>Framingham Offspring Study</span><!--/$-->.) I needed to get it lower. This test showed that if I continued on my trajectory, I would likely suffer from heart disease over time. This test also told me I don’t suffer from bad Lp(a) - that was a relief. As a result of my high ApoB and moderate LDL-C, my doctor immediately prescribed a <strong><!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>statin</span><!--/$--></strong> and said I should get a <strong><!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>CTA</span><!--/$--></strong> scan to detect any existing heart disease. My CTA scan confirmed that I had calcified plaque in my arteries (ie, heart disease). (By the way, I’ll get to what all of these fancy acronyms mean soon. Don’t worry if you don’t know what they are - I didn’t know either.)</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a6480749a0bd0c319216c15">Comparing and contrasting these two experiences was profoundly insightful for me. My PCP (primary care physician) was following standard guidelines and proclaimed that based on my results I was “totally okay.” He was not looking for more important biomarkers like ApoB or Lp(a) or <strong><!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>Hs-CRP</span><!--/$--></strong>. I could go on my merry way and do my thing. But my expensive concierge doctor showed me I had early-stage heart disease, needed to be on a statin to lower my ApoB, and that if I kept doing whatever I was doing, I’d grow increasingly more at risk of dying of heart disease. Since then, I’ve course-corrected and taken my heart health seriously. It’s something I work on every day and it’s reflected in the medications I take, the tests I get, the food I eat, and the way I live my life. I’ve made the conscious decision to not die of heart disease.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a6480ffa24fce66475c9744">I quickly realized that I didn’t need to sign up for an expensive concierge service to get these tests done. If I had known more about heart health beforehand, I could have<!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span> </span><!--/$-->asked (well, really <em>demanded</em>) my PCP to order these tests for me. When it comes to heart health, the tests you need to understand the most important biomarkers and whether or not you have disease (via imaging) are affordable for most people. We are talking $80 or so of blood tests twice annually and a one-time $150 imaging test that needs to be done every one to five years depending on your results. You don’t have to be rich to protect your heart the exact same way many billionaires and millionaires do. As far as preventative health goes, it’s easy, and my goal with this is to provide the knowledge, tools, and playbook to help you take control of your heart health the same way an elite billionaire would. For almost everyone, you don’t have to die of heart disease if you don’t want to.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a6480ecbc69f326211e1f78">The other reason I am doing this is because it’s critical that people be their own Advocate when they navigate the health system, and I want this to be a tool for everyone to do exactly that. What does being your own Advocate mean? I learned the term Advocate from my father-in-law who is a retired gastroenterologist. After we had our first child, my wife suffered from complications from a c-section. We were tied up in the hospital for over a week, and it was unclear whether we’d all make it home together. We were at one of the best hospitals in the country, but the attention we received from attending doctors and nurses was pretty frightening. Hours would go by between visits. They’d prescribe medications only to have them filled the following day. I quickly grew frustrated and realized that we needed to fight to take care of ourselves and find the right balance of being aggressively pushy and likable to the doctors and nurses. Even in hospitals where you think you are supposed to be taken care of every step of the way, you still need to fight for yourself and your loved ones. When I told my father-in-law about what was happening and that I was worried I was being too demanding, he told me I was doing the right thing by being our family’s Advocate, and that every doctor who is admitted to a hospital knows to do this if they want to receive quality care.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a64803ca5cbdc1a9a4fcce6">I experienced this repeatedly. We were admitted to the hospital for over a week when my daughter contracted viral meningitis (the scariest experience of my life). Even while working with incredible infectious disease doctors, I still had to fight and constantly remind people what the next steps were during our admission. Nobody is watching over you - it’s your job to organize things and ensure they’re on track. I had to coordinate between the infectious disease departments and neurology departments and make sure the people doing the lumbar puncture on my 9-month-old daughter weren’t just residents practicing on my child but experts who had conducted the procedure countless times before. You must Advocate for yourself and the ones you love.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a6480068b43f54ebecfbc21">While doctors may have the best of intentions and have in many ways engaged in one of the noblest of professions, they cannot and do not take care of you as well as you can take care of yourself. We are participating in a healthcare system that is incentivized to prioritize making money as opposed to keeping us healthy and out of the system in the first place. You need to fight for yourself. This guide is intended to help you fight for your heart.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a6480f78297fb3f1633d949">I am also doing this because, like any child, there’s something deep down inside of me that wants to make my parents proud. Both of my parents are doctors. My mother was an internist for many years and my father was a cardiologist. He spent almost the entirety of his <!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>career</span><!--/$--> trying to convince people they didn’t have to die of heart disease, and that we could use new technologies, namely CT and CTA scans, to detect and treat heart disease. His quest was initially met with resistance, but over time people converted, and now every cardiologist who understands anything about heart disease believes in what my father fought for, and they know his name and the work that he has done. He is widely published and has taught a new generation of cardiologists best practices when it comes to using imaging to detect and understand heart disease. There’s a piece of me that wants to help progress his work and bring what he has shared with the medical world to the broader patient population.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a6480188898cdc83e398df2">I’m a technology investor and entrepreneur, and believe we need a consumer facing company that is specifically dedicated to helping people not die of heart disease. I think you can do a lot of good in the world and build something quite meaningful by focusing on this problem. I have an idea of what the product and service looks like, but the thing I am questioning is how many people actually care about this? And care enough about it to actually do something. Of course we don’t want to die of something that’s totally avoidable, but heart disease is not something we experience every day. When we do experience it it’s because we either drop dead of a heart attack, have a near-death scare from a heart attack, or know someone in our family or friend group who suffered from a heart attack. We don’t think about it daily, and taking care of ourselves requires preventative measures that most people either don’t have the time to do or they just don’t want to prioritize. I get that completely. These services can also be expensive (although I am convinced a heart focused one can be delivered in an affordable way to millions of people). So part of my motivation is to actually see how many people care about this. How many people will read this? How many people will take the simple steps to avoid heart disease? And how many people would be interested in a service that makes taking these steps seamless and easy and affordable? I don’t know the answers to those questions, and I want to help figure them out.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a64808da2fffd6db70c52d5">What I do know is that whenever I talk about this with friends, their eyes light up. Particularly friends in their 30s and 40s who have recently had children and now think about their own mortality. They’re all interested in this, but I’ve been disappointed that only a minority of them have actually taken the requisite steps that I’ve learned about and recommend in this guide. I hope that changes. I’m an optimist, so I think it will. Today when I was dropping my children off at school, a fellow parent and entrepreneur told me he read<!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span> an article I wrote about heart disease</span><!--/$--> and called his doctor and is getting tested. That gave me hope. Interactions like that make me believe this is a worthwhile endeavor.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a64802c893dc7e3ec902cae">At the very least, I hope this guide is informative and helps you or someone you love avoid dying from heart disease.</p><span id="1449f34f2a64802ba6eafc47242e9509"></span><h2 id="block-1449f34f2a64802ba6eafc47242e9509"><strong>Background</strong></h2><p id="block-1449f34f2a648001bca5f3b891594982">Heart disease is the leading cause of death globally.

This is a staggering statistic unknown to most, including primary care physicians! That percentage continues to grow over time as the general population becomes increasingly less healthy (ie, sedentary, obese, poor diet, etc.). For all the damage heart disease inflicts on people’s lives and our health systems, it receives very little attention. Take a look at how frequently population killers are covered by the media:</p><p><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXead2et2LAAKWkxRA2vU0QcCVihTNEaS1Uar7AQwmqPzZowNY3ed-6qVVR8cliumD0DimF-pZKlBnx79NX85g6SH2gKczKI4aqzUCbym_hISevG1suzhvDhx85l10zLbDqnMNffEKyWBiIkHTzZ?key=idWtkEjKUuoicTj4jSLZJw" alt="image" width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy"></p><p id="block-1449f34f2a6480ddad16e7d6ab2be69e">It’s not sexy, and as a result, an overwhelming majority of the population is unaware of how to avoid succumbing to it. I think that’s super messed up and needs to change.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a6480f68d0ae75b8eb015f4">The thing about heart disease is that we have all the tools to make it a nonentity and remove it  from the Top 10 leading causes of death. Unfortunately, for a whole host of reasons, our primary care physicians are neither equipped or incentivized to lead the charge on fixing the problem. More often than not the first sign that someone has heart disease is they drop dead of a heart attack. And by the time fortunate patients who don’t drop dead approach their doctor about chest pain or other symptoms (eg shortness of breath with exertion, palpitations, vague dizziness, and fatigue) and are referred to a cardiologist, that cardiologist is going to wish you had visited them five years ago. <!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>Atherosclerosis</span><!--/$--> is a disease that slowly builds over decades, so the best way to really avoid dying from it is to start getting educated and taking action in your late 20s, 30s, and 40s.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a6480ce9c0ce44aa17dd96e">Over the past several months, I’ve spoken with several of the world’s leading cardiologists and lipidologists to better understand the key elements of heart disease prevention. One lipidologist I spoke with who works for a high-end concierge medicine service has had zero patients die of heart disease in the past ten years. What he does is not rocket science and anyone can do it if they know the right questions to ask. I’ve been compiling notes to get to the lowest common denominator of what is good enough and affordable so I can arm friends and family with the information and steps to put their heart health in their own hands. The best doctors unanimously agree that this is a preventable disease, but patients just don’t know what to do or how to navigate the health system to make sure they don’t succumb to it. This begs the question, if it’s so preventable, why don’t doctors take care of this for you?</p><span id="1449f34f2a64803ca4caf25aed02551f"></span><h2 id="block-1449f34f2a64803ca4caf25aed02551f"><strong>Perverse Incentives</strong></h2><p id="block-1449f34f2a64801ba13ccc77f6336725"><em>This section is just me on a soapbox with an axe to grind about the way our healthcare system works. Feel free to skip it.</em></p><p id="block-1449f34f2a64807d93f3ff5d13659655">People who enter the medical profession usually do so for noble reasons. They want to help other people. It is extremely rewarding to save lives, and also emotionally turbulent when you can’t. Growing up, I watched my parents go to the hospital at all hours of the night when they were on-call. Their pagers would buzz and they’d drive right in. It’s a physically exhausting vocation, too. Doctors do not get enough credit for what they go through, both in terms of the time they spend training and the money they spend on medical school.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a6480eeb698c7a8af98c603">That said, as noble as the profession is, the incentives of our healthcare system are royally messed up. I am a firm believer that incentives drive behaviors. You can pretty much learn everything you need to know about why an industry works a certain way based on the underlying economic incentives. As a result, our healthcare system in the US is actually sick-care. It’s designed to treat sickness. That’s how it makes money. The sicker we are and the longer we are sick, the better it is for healthcare systems: from hospitals to big pharma to primary care doctors and all of these different constituents’ employees. The system doesn’t make money unless we are sick. (I highly recommend reading the book<!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span> </span><!--/$--><em><!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>An American Sickness</span><!--/$--></em> if you are interested in learning more about this.)</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a6480c0b8f9c2a75ded20bc">Once you understand that, it becomes obvious why we receive the type of medical care we do. Very few people in the medical profession are focused on ensuring we do not get sick. This work is largely relegated to preventative care doctors. Most of their services are out-of-pocket expenses since insurance really only covers things that treat sickness, not things that prevent it. That fact in and of itself is absolutely nuts. You’d think that insurance companies would want to pay to prevent you from getting sick because paying to treat you when you get sick is exponentially more expensive. But since your insurance is normally covered by your employer, and since the average American only stays with their employer for 3-4 years, there is no incentive to keep you from getting really sick since it likely will happen when you’re employed by someone else and under their insurance plan and dime. That is something uniquely American and a severe dysfunction of the system. Nobody wants to foot the bill for someone else’s problem down the road.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a64804db9b2c1e6cbeab6a2">Anyways, back to these high-end concierge doctors that focus on preventative care. Since you’re paying out of pocket for them, they’re usually pretty darn good. They know a lot and are willing to do things that are outside of the standard healthcare guidelines. That’s because our guidelines usually lag 10-20 years behind the current science, and these preventative doctors follow the current science or something closer to it. The best practices they engage in are not common knowledge amongst most primary care physicians who are focused on cramming in as many patients in a day (every minute they run over with you is a dollar lost spending time with someone else). A lot of what concierge doctors do is bespoke and somewhat sophisticated and specific to their practices. But surprisingly, what they do to prevent and treat heart disease is not.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a64806d81c1d4f0383a0197">After speaking with many different practitioners who work in and run these practices, I’ve come to learn that everyone can get the same type of preventative heart healthcare that billionaires receive for roughly $300 or less a year. In fact, one person I spoke with who runs a very high-end concierge practice said to me that the heart health protocol of concierge medicine is something that really anyone can participate in so long as they know how to navigate it. That’s been the thing that’s shocked me the most - the fact that all of us can have access to the same heart healthcare that billionaires have access to for a couple hundred dollars out of pocket.</p><span id="1449f34f2a64805796c9f36123802fd2"></span><h2 id="block-1449f34f2a64805796c9f36123802fd2"><strong>What is heart disease?</strong></h2><p id="block-1449f34f2a6480c6a88ccaa863fcf00f">There are several different conditions that are categorized as heart disease, but for the sake of simplicity, I am going to talk about the most common one: atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (which I will henceforth refer to as ASCVD). <!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>ASCVD</span><!--/$--> is what happens when cholesterol-laden plaque accumulates in the arteries and begins to obstruct blood flow to the heart and other parts of the body. Heart attacks happen when this plaque breaks free of the artery walls and clogs your artery pathway (called the lumens), creating a blood clot that restricts blood flow. This often results in death. This is also what causes a stroke, but instead of blood not being able to circulate to the heart, it cannot circulate to the brain.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a648007adefcedcea84e44a"><em><strong>ASCVD is bad because the accumulation of plaque in your arteries is the thing that leads to a heart attack, and that’s the thing that can lead to death.</strong></em></p><p id="block-1449f34f2a64802caedad16c3071bca1">So how does plaque form? The short answer is that something called LDL penetrates your artery walls and begins to accumulate there and gradually turns into plaque.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a648014b7c9c612fa2bb935">The medium scientific answer (which I’ve mostly summarized from<!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span> the work of Peter Attia and Thomas Dayspring</span><!--/$-->) is:</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a6480818717ffbda6bcab65"><em>Plaque forms in your arteries when a lipoprotein (a particle made of protein and fats that carries cholesterol and triglycerides through your bloodstream to your cells) called ApoB (short for apolipoprotein B, a lipoprotein that coats LDL) crosses the </em><em><strong><!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>endothelium</span><!--/$--></strong></em><em> and gets stuck in the subendothelial space after it becomes oxidized there. There are several things that enable ApoB to make this journey, like smoking and high blood pressure which damage the endothelium and make it vulnerable to penetration. When ApoB accumulates in the subendothelium the immune system tries to attack them and it sends monocytes that turn into macrophages to eat this oxidized LDL in order to remove it from the artery walls. If the macrophages eat too much of it they explode into foam cells and when enough foam cells gather they form a fatty streak in the coronary artery. That is plaque! What’s crazy is this process begins when you are a teenager and compounds over the duration of your life. For some it moves fast, for others it moves slowly.</em></p><p id="block-1449f34f2a64801392c5cde090249271"><em>These foam cells continue to ooze together and form a mass of lipids. To control the damage smooth muscle cells in your artery migrate to this site and they secrete a kind of matrix in an attempt to build a barrier around it, just like a scar, that ends up as a fibrous cap atop arterial plaque. This plaque continues to grow, at first towards the outer arterial wall, but then into the lumen, the passage through which the blood flows. At a certain point in time this plaque hardens and becomes calcified. Once it’s calcified it mostly becomes a permanent fixture within your artery. Since it’s calcified it doesn’t go anywhere. While it may seem scary, calcified plaque is not the plaque that breaks free and causes a blood clot leading to a heart attack. It’s the non-calcified plaque - or soft plaque, the stuff that over time becomes calcified - that we need to worry about. Soft plaque can erode and rupture and create a heart attack via blood clot.</em></p><p id="block-1449f34f2a6480f3b7b8d497c25aed09">I also like <!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>Jeffrey Wessler</span><!--/$-->’s simple explanation of heart disease: “Coronary artery disease occurs when circulating fats in the blood (e.g. LDL) are pushed by a driving force (i.e. blood pressure) into a vessel wall that is vulnerable.”</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a648033a44cf285ccfdf3a2">There are several things called risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing heart disease (ie these are conditions that make it more likely bad things happen). Examples include things like high blood pressure (which, as Jeff alluded to, is the driving force pushing that LDL into your artery walls), high blood cholesterol (if you have more LDL in your blood, then it increases the likelihood it can penetrate your artery walls), and smoking (which damages and inflames your artery walls, making it easier for that LDL to enter). Over 50% of people in the United States have at least one of these risk factors. There are other medical conditions and lifestyle choices that are risk factors, too, like diabetes, obesity, poor nutrition, being physically inactive, and drinking alcohol - pretty much the run-of-the-mill things that we’ve all heard about that are considered unhealthy.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a6480f5afc3fb9fcc2264f0">My father’s friend, <!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>James Min</span><!--/$-->, an entrepreneur and guru of mine who started <!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>Cleerly</span><!--/$-->, explains heart disease as something that is multi-parametric.

It’s a fancy way of saying, “Don’t get sick or diseased.” Preventing heart disease is important for a variety of reasons, the primary one being so you don’t die. There are some other benefits as well. The heart sits at the epicenter of all things longevity and <!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>healthspan</span><!--/$-->.

First, there is primordial prevention, which is preventing heart disease before you have any sign of atherosclerosis (plaque accumulation). This is the best time to start! After that is primary (defined as having identifiable risk factors but no plaque), secondary (having plaque seen on an imaging test but not yet having experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event) and tertiary (you’ve survived a majorly bad event). The second best time to start is primary, then secondary, then tertiary.

Cardiologists care about understanding the state of disease and treating it. The only real way to understand whether you have heart disease is to know whether you have plaque in your arteries, and the best way to do that is to take a look at it with imaging technology.

You don’t want any more of it.<!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span> Calcium scores</span><!--/$--> measure calcified or “hard” plaque, the stuff soft plaque turns into.

CT scans will tell you this.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a64803db5f5d1ced3d0cee4">A CTA will measure both hard and soft plaque and the Cleerly scan will give you a 3D visualization of your arteries, tell you where the plaque exists, how much and what kind there is, and where your arteries are narrowing. If price is not an issue for you, absolutely get a CTA with Cleerly. At the bare minimum, get a CT scan. Depending on these diagnostic results, you’ll need to repeat this test once every 1-5 years, depending on the state of disease. The same way you get a colonoscopy at regular intervals to detect colon cancer and other disease, you should do this, too.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a6480a48c0ad3e03f3e1fa1">Most physicians will not be able to understand or read the results of your CT or CTA scan.

Your results will tell you your state of disease. Sometimes you may have none. That’s great!

We should focus on mitigating our risk factors, managing biomarkers, and treating any existing disease we may have. If we think about the multi-parametric approach to heart disease, we have effective medications to help us across the board.

With drugs like rosuvastatin, at 5mg most people get 85% of the maximum reduction in ApoB reduction, so there’s really no need to go higher than 10mg. For those that have adverse reactions to statins, we now have substitutes like Nexlitol (which can be expensive).

Behavioral changes, meaning modifying how you live your life, are usually also required. These changes are oriented around mitigating those risk factors we talked about: high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity, poor nutrition, being physically inactive, and drinking alcohol. None of this should surprise you - it’s essentially being healthy. Fortunately, everything I’ve learned that is “most important” to do behaviorally has many positive externalities - not only will it help your heart health, but it will also help your overall healthspan.</p><p id="block-1449f34f2a648038909ec147213d8e05">This means regular exercise (both strength training, ideally 3x per week, and cardio training that helps to improve <!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>V02 max</span><!--/$--> like <!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>Zone 2 training</span><!--/$-->). It also means diet (nutrition, in addition to pharmacology, is the most important thing to reduce ApoB). Sticking to a <!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>Mediterranean diet</span><!--/$--> that is light on carbohydrates and saturated fats is almost always the safest bet. Almost every health diet is some permutation of this. Also, if you smoke, stop immediately.</p><ul><li id="block-1449f34f2a648098b6cdd9986b436197">You need to be mindful of what you put into your body. There are so many fad diets out there, but when it comes to heart health, it’s safe to say that a Mediterranean diet is best, ideally one that is focused on low carbohydrate and saturated fat intake. Don’t eat too much. Don’t eat too little. For me, as simple as this guidance is, I’ve found it to be the most difficult part. I love food. Particularly the stuff that’s not good for you: pasta and pizza and bread. I don’t beat myself up over being perfect when I diet. I just try to focus on eating well during the week, and on the weekends, I’ll usually indulge a couple times. What’s more important to me is the quality of the food I eat - I really try to avoid processed foods and stick to whole foods.</li><li id="block-1449f34f2a6480c2b26bc3c5151fb465">Regular exercise is critical, but being deliberate about the type of exercise is super important. We should target strength training ideally three times per week with a focus on <strong><!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>resistance training</span><!--/$--></strong>. For cardio work, we should focus on improving our VO2 max by trying to get 2-3 hours of Zone 2 training in per week, and a set of <strong><!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>HIIT</span><!--/$--></strong> at Zone 4. That’s a lot of stuff. Realistically, it’s nearly impossible to do that every week if you have a job, children, responsibilities, etc. I try to focus on the resistance training and Zone 2 training and get in 5-6 workouts per week. I don’t stress when I’m not perfect about this.</li><li id="block-1449f34f2a6480abbc18efba233a1c63">You need to sleep. Ideally, somewhere between 7-9 hours per night. Without it, we die faster. End of story. I used to invest in sleep trackers and neat technology to help me sleep better, but I found that being overly scientific about it made me sleep worse. I was putting pressure on myself to sleep better, and that pressure made me <!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span>sleep worse</span><!--/$-->.

And throwing your emotional health to the wayside can make life feel not fun. There’s enough literature out there with regard to how to manage stress and stay in touch with your emotions. I won’t get into it. I have been talking to a therapist weekly for years. It’s helped me to understand how to label my emotions, how those emotions drive my behaviors, and what causes me to feel those things. That’s been super helpful. I also love the mindfulness app<!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><span> Waking Up by Sam Harris</span><!--/$-->.

It is the easiest way to die of heart disease. I used to smoke cigarettes. I picked them up in high school, smoked throughout college, and intermittently did when I was building my first two companies. I know how hard it is to quit. I’ve successfully used nicotine mints and gum over the years to wean myself off cigarettes.</li><li id="block-1449f34f2a6480e18d79cc4ce455a112">Alcohol isn’t good for your health, and it’s really bad for your heart health. I think it’s unreasonable to tell people not to drink alcohol if they like it. I like an occasional glass of wine, and I love tequila. And I also like to drink in some social settings, but I don’t drink very often. As I’ve gotten older, my body just can’t handle it. It makes me sleep like crap, and I always feel bad the next morning. If you’re going to drink, at least make sure it’s really good alcohol that you enjoy and don’t drink too much of it.</li></ul><p id="block-1449f34f2a6480cb891bdc75b56dc1a0">These are a lot of behavioral changes! It can seem daunting. It is daunting. It’s hard to stomach just how to do all this stuff at once. Over time I think I’ve worked on it enough and it now brings me joy to exercise, eat well, and get sleep. I feel unhealthy if I don’t do those things, so they are just part of my routine. I’m no expert at habit forming. I’ve read some books on it, but generally, what I’ve found works for me is just biting off a little bit at a time and not getting mad at myself for not doing this perfectly. Everyone has their own healthy balance of enjoying life and its indulgences and being healthy. Find yours.

Let's break it down:</em></p><p id="block-1449f34f2a648054a4e0fdd2f27c5092"><em><strong>Key Findings</strong></em></p><ol type="1"><li id="block-1449f34f2a6480c29c8ee4ef4062f03b"><em><strong>LDL Cholesterol (LDL-C)</strong></em><em>: Your LDL-C is at 29 mg/dL, which is considerably below the optimal range. This is very low, likely due to your statin and ezetimibe therapy. While low LDL-C reduces cardiovascular risk, extremely low levels should be discussed with your doctor to ensure they are safe and intended.</em></li><li id="block-1449f34f2a6480b1aad5f25619b6e4f4"><em><strong>HDL Cholesterol (HDL-C)</strong></em><em>: Your HDL-C is 44 mg/dL, which is acceptable but on the lower side of optimal (optimal is usually above 50 mg/dL). Higher HDL-C is generally protective against heart disease.</em></li><li id="block-1449f34f2a6480b99bb2ecb06b131f8b"><em><strong>Triglycerides</strong></em><em>: Your triglyceride level is 74 mg/dL, which is well within the optimal range.</em></li><li id="block-1449f34f2a648090be82f40770e83e98"><em><strong>Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)]</strong></em><em>: Less than 10 mg/dL, which is excellent as high levels are associated with increased cardiovascular risk.</em></li><li id="block-1449f34f2a64801f9757c3293a265e24"><em><strong>Inflammation (hs-CRP)</strong></em><em>: Your high-sensitivity C-reactive protein is &lt;0.2 mg/L, indicating very low levels of inflammation, which is good for cardiovascular health.</em></li><li id="block-1449f34f2a64805e9374e525d7170a99"><em><strong>Omega-3 Index</strong></em><em>: Your omega-3 fatty acid levels are healthy at 6.8%, with a good balance between EPA and DHA, which are important for heart health.</em></li></ol><p id="block-1449f34f2a6480458790dafa23ed5856"><em><strong>Recommendations</strong></em></p><ul><li id="block-1449f34f2a6480fb9e61d8a16e506b4f"><em><strong>Discuss LDL-C Levels</strong></em><em>: Given your very low LDL-C, it would be worthwhile to discuss with your healthcare provider whether adjustments to your statin therapy might be appropriate, or if such low levels are part of a therapeutic strategy, especially if you have a history of cardiovascular disease.</em></li><li id="block-1449f34f2a64801c9d8fef85f7c81794"><em><strong>Boost HDL-C</strong></em><em>: To potentially improve your HDL-C, consider increasing physical activity, possibly incorporating more aerobic exercises. Additionally, dietary adjustments such as including more healthy fats from nuts, olive oil, and fatty fish can help.</em></li><li id="block-1449f34f2a648032af2fddac992770e8"><em><strong>Maintain Healthy Lifestyle</strong></em><em>: Continue with a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit intake of saturated fats and sugars, which you seem to be managing well given your current lipid profile.</em></li><li id="block-1449f34f2a6480dfb43ad6e14d857482"><em><strong>Monitor and Maintain</strong></em><em>: Regular monitoring of your cholesterol levels and other biomarkers, along with routine consultations with your healthcare provider, will be essential in maintaining your health status, especially considering your current medication regimen.</em></li></ul><p id="block-1449f34f2a64809996e7daf4043d52a4"><em>Your current lab results suggest effective management of cholesterol and cardiovascular risk factors, likely aided by your medication and possibly your lifestyle choices. However, always consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice and to ensure that your treatment plan is optimal for your specific health needs.”</em></p><p id="block-1449f34f2a64800da837db58210182e3">Pretty incredible.

<p dir="auto">Btop release v1.3.0</p>
<p dir="auto">Big release with GPU support added for Linux and platform support for OpenBSD. Big thanks to <a href="https://github.com/romner-set">@romner-set</a> (GPU support) and <a href="https://github.com/joske">@joske</a> (OpenBSD support) for contributions.
And a multitude of bugfixes and small changes, see <a href="https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG.md</a> and latest <a href="https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/releases/latest">release</a> for detailed list and attributions.</p>

<p dir="auto">GPU monitoring added for Linux!</p>
<p dir="auto">Compile from git main to try it out.</p>
<p dir="auto">Use keys <code>5</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>7</code> and <code>0</code> to show/hide the gpu monitoring boxes. <code>5</code> = Gpu 1, <code>6</code> = Gpu 2, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">Gpu stats/graphs can also be displayed in the "Cpu box" (not as verbose), see the cpu options menu for info and configuration.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that the binaries provided on the release page (when released) and the continuous builds will not have gpu support enabled.</p>
<p dir="auto">Because the GPU support relies on loading of dynamic gpu libraries, gpu support will not work when also static linking.</p>
<p dir="auto">See <a href="#compilation-linux">Compilation Linux</a> for more info on how to compile with gpu monitoring support.</p>
<p dir="auto">Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/romner-set">@romner-set</a> who wrote the vast majority of the implementation for GPU support.</p>
<p dir="auto">Big update with version bump to 1.3 coming soon.</p>

<p dir="auto">Work on the OSX [macOS] and FreeBSD branches, both initiated and mostly worked on by <a href="https://github.com/joske">@joske</a>, will likely be completed in the coming weeks.
The OSX [macOS] branch has some memory leaks that needs to be sorted out and both have some issues with the processes cpu usage calculation and other smaller issues that needs fixing.</p>

<p dir="auto">The Linux version of btop++ is complete. Released as version 1.0.0</p>
<p dir="auto">I will be providing statically compiled binaries for a range of architectures in every release for those having problems compiling.</p>
<p dir="auto">For compilation GCC 11 is required.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please report any bugs to the <a href="https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/issues/new?assignees=aristocratos&amp;labels=bug&amp;template=bug_report.md&amp;title=%5BBUG%5D">Issues</a> page.</p>
<p dir="auto">The development plan right now:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>1.1.0 macOS [OSX] support</li>
<li>1.2.0 FreeBSD support</li>
<li>1.3.0 Support for GPU monitoring</li>
<li>1.X.0 Other platforms and features...</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Windows support is not in the plans as of now, but if anyone else wants to take it on, I will try to help.</p>

<p dir="auto">This project is gonna take some time until it has complete feature parity with bpytop, since all system information gathering will have to be written from scratch without any external libraries.
And will need some help in the form of code contributions to get complete support for BSD and macOS/OSX.</p>

<li><code>/usr/local/share/btop/themes</code></li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>If <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> is set, the user themes directory is <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/btop/themes</code></li>
<li>Otherwise, if <code>$HOME</code> is set, the user themes directory is <code>$HOME/.config/btop/themes</code></li>
<li>Otherwise, the user themes directory is <code>~/.config/btop/themes</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The <code>make install</code> command places the default themes in <code>[$PREFIX or /usr/local]/share/btop/themes</code>.
User created themes should be placed in the user themes directory.</p>

<li>
<p dir="auto">If you are having problems with the characters in the graphs not looking like they do in the screenshots, it's likely a problem with your systems configured fallback font not having support for braille characters.</p>

<p dir="auto">If text is misaligned and you use Konsole or Yakuake, turning off "Bi-Directional text rendering" is a possible fix.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Characters clipping into each other or text/border misalignments are not bugs caused by btop, but most likely a fontconfig or terminal problem where the braille characters making up the graphs aren't rendered correctly.</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/rocm/rocm_smi_lib.git --depth 1 -b rocm-5.6.x lib/rocm_smi_lib"><pre>git clone https://github.com/rocm/rocm_smi_lib.git --depth 1 -b rocm-5.6.x lib/rocm_smi_lib</pre></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/07/measuring_ai_models_hampered_by/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/07/measuring_ai_models_hampered_by/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45856804">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>AI companies regularly tout their models' performance on benchmark tests as a sign of technological and intellectual superiority. But those results, widely used in marketing, may not be meaningful.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=mdA5lVvNcU" rel="nofollow">study</a> [PDF] from researchers at the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) and several other universities and organizations <a href="https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/news-events/study-identifies-weaknesses-in-how-ai-systems-are-evaluated/" rel="nofollow">has found</a> that only 16 percent of 445 LLM benchmarks for natural language processing and machine learning use rigorous scientific methods to compare model performance.</p>
<p>What's more, about half the benchmarks claim to measure abstract ideas like reasoning or harmlessness without offering a clear definition of those terms or how to measure them.</p>

    

<p>In a statement, Andrew Bean, lead author of the study said, "Benchmarks underpin nearly all claims about advances in AI. But without shared definitions and sound measurement, it becomes hard to know whether models are genuinely improving or just appearing to."</p>

        


        

<p>When OpenAI released GPT-5 earlier this year, the company's pitch rested on a foundation of benchmark scores, such as those from AIME 2025, SWE-bench Verified, Aider Polyglot, MMMU, and HealthBench Hard.</p>
<p>These tests present AI models with a series of questions and model makers strive to have their bots answer as many as possible. The questions or challenges vary depending upon the focus of the test. For a math-oriented benchmark like AIME 2025, AI models are asked to answer questions <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/MathArena/aime_2025/viewer/default/train?views%5B%5D=train" rel="nofollow">like</a>:</p>

        

<p>
  <code>Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $n+2$ divides the product $3(n+3)(n^2+9)$.</code>
</p>
<p>"[GPT-5] sets a new state of the art across math (94.6 percent on AIME 2025 without tools), real-world coding (74.9 percent on SWE-bench Verified, 88 percent on Aider Polyglot), multimodal understanding (84.2 percent on MMMU), and health (46.2 percent on HealthBench Hard)—and those gains show up in everyday use," OpenAI said at the time. "With GPT‑5 pro's extended reasoning, the model also sets a new SOTA on GPQA, scoring 88.4 percent without tools."</p>
<p>But, as noted in the OII study, "Measuring what Matters: Construct Validity in Large Language Model Benchmarks," 27 percent of the reviewed benchmarks rely on <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8295573/" rel="nofollow">convenience sampling</a>, meaning that the sample data is chosen for the sake of convenience rather than using methods like random sampling or <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/stratified-sampling" rel="nofollow">stratified sampling</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>"For example, if a benchmark reuses questions from a calculator-free exam such as AIME," the study says, "numbers in each problem will have been chosen to facilitate basic arithmetic. Testing only on these problems would not predict performance on larger numbers, where LLMs struggle."</p>
<p>The OII study authors have created <a href="https://oxrml.com/measuring-what-matters/checklist.html?state=0" rel="nofollow">a checklist</a> with eight recommendations to make benchmarks better. These include defining the phenomenon being measured, preparing for contamination, and using statistical methods to compare models. Alongside the OII, the other study authors are affiliated with EPFL, Stanford University, the Technical University of Munich, UC Berkeley, the UK AI Security Institute, the Weizenbaum Institute, and Yale University.</p>

        

<p>Bean et al. are far from the first to question the validity of AI benchmark tests. In February, for example, researchers from the European Commission's Joint Research Center published a paper titled, "Can We Trust AI Benchmarks? An Interdisciplinary Review of Current Issues in AI Evaluation."&nbsp;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/15/boffins_question_ai_model_test/">we noted at the time</a>, the authors of that research identified "a series of systemic flaws in current benchmarking practices, such as misaligned incentives, construct validity issues, unknown unknowns, and problems with the gaming of benchmark results."</p>
<p>At least some of those who design benchmark tests are aware of these concerns. On the same day that the OII study was announced, Greg Kamradt, president of the Arc Prize Foundation, a non-profit that administers an award program based on the Abstract and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) benchmark, <a href="https://arcprize.org/blog/arc-prize-verified-program" rel="nofollow">announced</a>, "ARC Prize Verified, a program to increase the rigor of evaluating frontier systems on the ARC-AGI benchmark."</p>
<p>Verification and testing rigor are necessary, Kamradt observed, because scores reported by model makers or third-parties may arise from different datasets and prompting methods that make comparison difficult.</p>
<p>"This causes confusion in the market and ultimately detracts from our goal of measuring frontier AI progress," Kamradt explained.</p>
<p>OpenAI and Microsoft reportedly have their own internal benchmark for determining when AGI&nbsp; – vaguely <a href="https://openai.com/index/planning-for-agi-and-beyond/" rel="nofollow">defined</a> by OpenAI as "AI systems that are generally smarter than humans" – has been achieved. That milestone matters to the two companies because it releases OpenAI from its IP rights and Azure API exclusivity <a href="https://openai.com/index/next-chapter-of-microsoft-openai-partnership/" rel="nofollow">agreement with Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p>This AGI benchmark, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-openai-financial-definition-agi-171602286.html" rel="nofollow">according to The Information</a>, can be met by OpenAI developing AI systems that generate at least $100 billion in profits. Measuring money turns out to be easier than measuring intelligence. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>TL:DR - My friends and I were playing around with Linux and accidentally submitted a 9700X3D score, which got written up in the news. I'd like to set the record straight: The 9700X3D isn't real, and we should all learn from this. Remember, all benchmarks can be faked!</strong></p>

<p>A weeks ago, my friends and I were talking about the inner workings of Zen 5. We were talking about how the CPUID instruction works, and how AMD MSRs are technically editable if you ask the processor nicely. One of us realized you could mess with Linux's <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code> to change your CPU to whatever you want, and we were wondering whether benchmark software would detect this... so, to test, one of us took a heavily PBO'd 9700X and changed <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code> to be a "9700X3D" and ran a Passmark run to see if the software would be fooled...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=AMD+Ryzen+7+9700X3D+8-Core&amp;id=6993">https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=AMD+Ryzen+7+9700X3D+8-Core&amp;id=6993</a></p>

<p>...It turns out that Passmark not only didn't notice that <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code> didn't match the CPUID, it <strong>actually submitted the result to the real live Passmark database</strong>... which is how we got here. Fast forward to today, and I google "9700X3D" out of curiosity. <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/342644/amd-ryzen-7-9700x3d-appears-in-leaked-passmark-benchmark">TPU</a>, Videocardz, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-prepping-new-x3d-chip-with-higher-clock-speeds-ryzen-7-9700x3d-spotted-in-benchmarks-that-rival-ryzen-7-9800x3d-new-strix-halo-chip-also-unearthed">Tom's Hardware</a>, <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Ryzen-7-9700X3D-New-Zen-5-CPU-shows-up-on-PassMark.1155991.0.html">Notebookcheck</a>, <a href="https://www.igorslab.de/en/ryzen-7-9700x3d-new-amd-processor-shows-up-in-benchmark-with-uncertainties/">igorsLAB</a>, KitGuru, <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/110140-amd-prepares-ryzen-7-9700x3d-budget-friendly-3d.html">TechSpot</a>, OC3D, and countless others... <strong>all wrote articles about a single unverified Passmark test.</strong> Shoutout to Videocardz and KitGuru who (as of the time of writing) corrected their articles.</p>

<p>You can preorder one <a href="https://www.lebanonstores.com/shop-1/amd-ryzen-7-9700x3d-processor-pre-order-8-cores-16-threads-3d-v-cache-high-performance-gaming-cpu">here</a>, apparently. Crazy.</p>

<p>So, uh, here we are now. I'm writing this post partly to set the record straight that this CPU is not real (as far as I know?), but I'm also writing to tech fans and journalists everywhere, to say: <strong>DO NOT TRUST ONE-OFF ONLINE BENCHMARKS!</strong></p>

<p>In this case, we used <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code> to fool the test suite. <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code> is very easy to spoof because it's just an inode (see code below), but it's still possible to spoof any other part of the system too, even the hardware-level AMD64 CPUID instruction (either using a VM or by editing the MSRs using AMD's debugging system) which means that Windows isn't safe either. To be clear, this isn't a problem specific to Passmark, it's just a fact of computing, that <strong>there is no real way to 100% guarantee a benchmark is accurate.</strong></p>

<p>You might think "Benchmark companies need to be more careful about accepting results!", which is true, but even if Passmark <em>had</em> checked if cpuinfo matched CPUID, a bad actor might still get away with it by simply changing both.</p>

<p><em>Really, the only solid takeaway here is that we all need to do better at double-checking any rumours.</em> Many redditors correctly pointed out that the clock speeds were much higher than even a 9800X3D, which is correct. If we had actually been trying to fake a listing, we might have noticed that, but we are doofuses messing with Linux and we were just curious if it would even work.</p>

<p>Some media outlets even started making things up in an attempt to seem informed. TechPowerUp wrote: <em>"Current rumors suggest it will feature a 120 W TDP, targeting the same $400-$450 range as its predecessor."</em> which isn't specified anywhere at all. VideoCardz also suggests a 120W TDP, but they also correctly recognise that the clocks are way too high. To be clear, I have no idea how the 120W rumour started, but it scares me that it only took less than a week before people started making facts up.</p>

<p><strong>Obligatory disclaimer: Please don't fake CPU benchmarks!</strong> I feel badly for all of the people who may have held off on a 9800X3D purchase because of this Passmark that we <em>thought</em> wouldn't work. That's a big part of why I wrote this post.</p>

<p>The way we did this particular edit was with the following line of Linux terminal nonsense; <code>sed -E 's/^(model name[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*).*/\1desired shenanigans/' /proc/cpuinfo | sudo tee /root/fakecpuinfo &gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; sudo mount --bind /root/fakecpuinfo /proc/cpuinfo</code></p>

<p>This isn't the only way, though. <a href="https://chipsandcheese.com/p/why-you-cant-trust-cpuid">Chips And Cheese</a> did an excellent article on editing the CPUID bits themselves. You can also change these bits using a VM, of course.</p>

<h2>Thank you all for reading, may your GHz be high and your temperatures low. Remember, never trust a benchmark.</h2>

<p>Edit: Thank you for all the funny words! I've fixed some typos. I'm in the comments if you have any questions, I guess. Massive shoutout to Arae down in the comments, the owner of the world's only Ryzen 7 9700X3D and the person who started this hilarious mess. <strong>Here are some background splash images that were made for the articles discussing this nonexistent CPU:</strong></p>

<p>I have no idea if AMD is *actually* working on a 9700X3D. I don't think so, (I mean, they haven't made a 7700X3D), and it definitely won't be 5.8GHz, but hey, they might. All of this shenanigans has taken place starting Nov. 3rd, so anything after this dies down might be real.</p>

After seven years at Terranova, I’m joining a new company in a similar role as a senior software engineer.</p>
<p>When I told my supervisor, he wasn’t surprised. I’d been talking openly about my struggles for over a year—lack of motivation, missing promotion, compensation not matching my contributions.</p>
<p>My peers were caught off guard. They knew I was frustrated sometimes, but I hadn’t been ranting to them constantly. That was intentional.</p>
<p>By the time I had the exit interview with HR, it was a formality. When they asked “Is there something we can do to change your mind?” I answered: “You already tried everything. We’ve already talked.”</p>
<p>The conversation was over. We just discussed notice periods and bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Here’s what surprised me: the practices that made my exit smooth weren’t “exit strategies.” They were professional habits I should have built years earlier—habits that made work better even when I was staying.</p>
<h2 id="talk-to-decision-makers-not-just-colleagues">Talk to Decision-Makers, Not Just Colleagues</h2>
<p>For a year before leaving, I talked openly with my supervisor and HR about my dissatisfaction. Not ranting. Not threatening. Just honest communication about what wasn’t working.</p>
<p>Ranting with colleagues feels cathartic, but it changes nothing. It drains <a href="https://andreacanton.dev/posts/2025-05-27-energy-time/">your energy</a> and creates negativity without solutions.</p>
<p>Talking to people who can actually change things? That’s professional problem-solving.</p>
<p>Even if nothing changed at Terranova, I built a relationship based on transparency. They knew where I stood. I gave them opportunities to address issues. When I finally left, there was no drama, no burned bridges.</p>
<p><strong>This isn’t just for leaving.</strong> It’s <a href="https://andreacanton.dev/posts/2025-08-17-lead-by-example/">leading by example</a>. Instead of complaining about problems, you address them directly with people who have power to fix them.</p>
<h2 id="document-like-youre-going-on-holiday">Document Like You’re Going on Holiday</h2>
<p>In my last two weeks, I kept telling colleagues: “Let’s play the game of ‘Andrea is gone’ with Andrea still present.”</p>
<p>I’d already documented everything. The game was about learning to use that documentation instead of just asking me. They needed to practice finding answers while I could still help if they got stuck.</p>
<p>But documentation isn’t an exit strategy. It’s a practice that makes your life easier every day.</p>
<p>When you write things down:</p>
<ul>
<li>You clarify your own thinking</li>
<li>You reduce cognitive load—you’re not the single point of failure</li>
<li>You can actually take holidays without anxiety</li>
<li>New team members onboard faster</li>
<li>You look more professional, not less</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, good documentation makes you “replaceable.” But that’s freedom, not weakness. When the system doesn’t depend on you remembering everything, you can focus on higher-value work.</p>
<p>The best time to document isn’t two weeks before leaving. It’s right now.</p>
<h2 id="choose-your-battles-strategically">Choose Your Battles Strategically</h2>
<p>“Never back down” sounds like you should fight every battle. But professional growth requires the opposite: strategic choices about where to invest <a href="https://andreacanton.dev/posts/2025-05-27-energy-time/">your energy</a>.</p>
<p>I learned to ask: <strong>Which responsibilities build my professional skills? Which ones trap me in work that doesn’t grow my career?</strong></p>
<p>Some battles are worth fighting. Others drain you without advancing your goals.</p>
<p>This isn’t about being lazy or avoiding hard work. It’s about investing your finite energy where it compounds—learning new technologies, solving complex problems, building relationships.</p>
<p>When you manage responsibilities strategically, you either grow into better opportunities at your current company, or you build skills that make you attractive elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="the-paradox-being-ready-to-leave-made-leaving-less-necessary">The Paradox: Being Ready to Leave Made Leaving Less Necessary</h2>
<p>Here’s the strange thing: practicing these habits—communicating clearly, documenting well, managing energy strategically—actually improved my work situation.</p>
<p>When I documented processes, I felt less stressed. When I communicated issues, some got addressed (not all, but some). When I chose battles carefully, I had energy for meaningful work.</p>
<p>Being “ready to leave” doesn’t mean you’re checked out. It means you’re working professionally regardless of how long you stay.</p>
<p>The irony? If I’d built these habits earlier, I might have been happier at Terranova. Or I might have left sooner. Either way, I would have been making conscious choices instead of feeling trapped.</p>
<h2 id="never-burn-bridges">Never Burn Bridges</h2>
<p>When you finally do leave, these habits make the transition clean.</p>
<p><strong>Know the law.</strong> Understand your notice period, your rights, your obligations.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the hierarchy.</strong> Your supervisor should hear first, then HR, then your peers. Don’t gossip about your departure before it’s official.</p>
<p><strong>Stay useful until the last day.</strong> But “useful” means helping your team work without you, not taking on new responsibilities. Finish what you can. Transfer knowledge. Make the transition smooth.</p>
<p><strong>Be genuinely grateful.</strong> Seven years taught me a lot. The people were mostly great. The work had value. Even when things weren’t perfect, there were real relationships and real growth.</p>
<p>Leaving well isn’t about being fake or political. It’s about <a href="https://andreacanton.dev/posts/2025-08-17-lead-by-example/">acting with integrity</a> until the end.</p>
<h2 id="starting-fresh-with-the-same-habits">Starting Fresh (With the Same Habits)</h2>
<p>Next week I join a new company. I’ll be the new person again after being established for seven years. It’s humbling and exciting.</p>
<p>But I’m bringing these habits with me from day one:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll document as I learn</li>
<li>I’ll communicate openly with my new supervisor</li>
<li>I’ll choose responsibilities that build my skills</li>
<li>I’ll work like I might stay forever, and like I might leave tomorrow</li>
</ul>
<p>Because these aren’t “exit strategies.” They’re how professionals work, whether they’re staying for one year or ten.</p>
<h2 id="the-real-lesson">The Real Lesson</h2>
<p>The best way to leave well is to work well every day.</p>
<p>Don’t wait until you have another offer to communicate what’s not working. Don’t wait until your last week to document what you know. Don’t wait until you’re burned out to manage your energy strategically.</p>
<p>Build the habits now. Whether you stay or leave, you’ll be better off.</p>
<p>And if you do leave someday? Nobody will be surprised. The conversation will already be over. You’ll just discuss notice periods and bureaucracy.</p>
<p><em>As always, these are my thoughts from my experience. Your situation is different. But maybe something here resonates with where you are now.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Classical state-machine replication protocols, such as Paxos, rely on a distinguished leader process to order commands. Unfortunately, this approach makes the leader a single point of failure and increases the latency for clients that are not co-located with it. As a response to these drawbacks, Egalitarian Paxos introduced an alternative, leaderless approach, that allows replicas to order commands collaboratively. Not relying on a single leader allows the protocol to maintain non-zero throughput with up to $f$ crashes of any processes out of a total of $n = 2f+1$. The protocol furthermore allows any process to execute a command $c$ fast, in $2$ message delays, provided no more than $e = \lceil\frac{f+1}{2}\rceil$ other processes fail, and all concurrently submitted commands commute with $c$; the latter condition is often satisfied in practical systems.
<br>Egalitarian Paxos has served as a foundation for many other replication protocols. But unfortunately, the protocol is very complex, ambiguously specified and suffers from nontrivial bugs. In this paper, we present EPaxos* -- a simpler and correct variant of Egalitarian Paxos. Our key technical contribution is a simpler failure-recovery algorithm, which we have rigorously proved correct. Our protocol also generalizes Egalitarian Paxos to cover the whole spectrum of failure thresholds $f$ and $e$ such that $n \ge \max\{2e+f-1, 2f+1\}$ -- the number of processes that we show to be optimal.

tech giants by giving developers and users more choice. Apple’s
“notarisation” of mobile apps contradicts these objectives. A
civil-society complaint against Apple’s monopolistic control over app
distribution aims to change that.</p><figure><img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/ee/3d/407431339a047caf4fc5f1ea05db.png" alt="Abstract image of an apple shape outlined by a jagged, snake-like red and black form on a gray background"><figcaption>CC-BY-SA 4.0. by <a href="https://rahak.net/work.html">Rahak</a> for FSFE </figcaption></figure><p>The EU’s <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/dma/dma"><strong>Digital
Markets Act (DMA)</strong></a> aims for a structural reset of
power in digital markets, a shift from corporate control toward
<strong>device neutrality</strong>, where users decide
what runs on their devices. For Free Software, this legislation can be a
unique opportunity by finally opening closed ecosystems - like iOS - to
Free Software alternatives. Apple has reacted aggressively against the
DMA, <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/apple-litigation/apple-litigation.en.html">litigating
against regulators</a>, and <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/campaigns/device-neutrality/202404-FSFE-apple-report-EC.pdf">unfairly
excluding Free Software from iOS and iPadOS</a> by blocking the

initiated by civil-society organisations</a> targeting Apple’s
non-compliance with the DMA, urging the European Commission to enforce
the DMA’s rules related to interoperability and the app store, giving
users and developers effective choice over which apps and app stores
they want to use on their devices. This complaint is important for
software freedom, contextualising the diverse approaches towards
curation of software distribution.</p><h3 id="id-the-action-taken-calling-out-the-illegality-of-apple’s-“notarization”-of-mobile-apps">The action taken: calling out the illegality of Apple’s
“notarization” of mobile apps</h3><p>Imagine that you are a Free Software developer willing to make your
program available in the iPhone. You want to have your software
curated in a non-profit Free Software-friendly app store (like F-Droid
for Android). This is important for you because you prefer to not have
Apple controlling what your software does and to whom it should be made
available. </p><p>This all sounds good, until you realise that your plan is not
possible in iOS. There is no non-profit Free Software app store
available for iPhones and iPads. Apple blocks non-profit app stores with
extremely high financial requirements and prohibits unfettered
installation of software. Even for the Free Software commercial ones,
such as the <a href="https://altstore.io/">Alt Store</a>, Apple still
applies a complete review and control, through an encryption layer over
distributed source code.</p><p>On October 22, <a href="https://www.article19.org/">ARTICLE 19</a>
and <a href="https://freiheitsrechte.org/">Gesellschaft für
Freiheitsrechte</a> (GFF) filed a complaint against Apple for
non-compliance with the DMA to tackle these issues. The complaint
highlights the following conduct as illegal under the DMA:</p><ul><li>Apple does not allow the unfettered installation of third-party
software (sideloading);</li><li>Apple prevents third-party app stores to effectively running on iOS and
iPadOS;</li></ul><ul><li>Apple does not provide effective free-of-charge interoperability
with the company’s features controlled via iOS and iPadOS.</li></ul><p>The core of the complaint is twofold:</p><ol><li><p>Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/distribute/app-review/">complete
review of apps</a> – known as <strong>“notarisation” process</strong> -
a mandatory step for distributing any software on its
platforms, represents the very gatekeeping behaviour the DMA was written
to prevent. <br>

Notarisation forces all apps, even those distributed outside Apple’s App Store, to be submitted to Apple’s servers for scanning,
approval, and cryptographic re-signing before installation. The result
is that Apple retains full control over what software users can install
and how developers can distribute it. This transforms Apple’s
self-appointed “security review” into a choke-point of power, locking in
developers and users into the company’s proprietary ecosystem.</p></li><li><p>Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/download/alternate_eu_terms_addendum.pdf">requirements
for third-party app stores</a>.<br>
Apple has conditioned the provision of a third-party app store
as a native app in its iOS and iPadOS on (1) providing a standby letter of credit in the
amount of €1,000,000 from a financial institution that is at least
A-rated; or (2) being a member of good standing in the Apple Developer
Program for two continuous years or more and have an app that had more
than 1,000,000 first annual installs on iOS and iPadOS in the EU in the
prior calendar year. </p></li></ol><p>Both requirements are extremely unfair and disproportionately affects
non-profit Free Software projects, SMEs, startups, and individual
developers. This discriminates by size and renders the market
inaccessible to smaller new entrants.</p><h3 id="id-the-implications-of-apple’s-notarisation-for-software-freedom">The implications of Apple’s notarisation for software freedom</h3><p>For <strong>Free Software developers</strong>, the
implications are even more severe. Apple’s notarisation regime requires
developers to hold a paid Apple Developer account, accept restrictive
legal terms, and submit binaries to a closed, opaque process. Once
approved, the binaries are re-signed by Apple and distributed under
digital restriction management (DRM). </p><p>This breaks users’ rights when it comes to Free Software freedoms.
Users can no longer verify that the source code they read corresponds to
the binary they run, nor can they freely redistribute software that
Apple refuses to notarise. What makes this process absurd is that Apple
applies this notarisation process to all apps running on iOS, no matter
which channel of distribution. This means that a developer of an
alternative app store for iOS has actually no control over the apps they
can distribute in their store, as Apple still holds gatekeeping power
through notarisation.</p><p>Under the DMA, gatekeepers must enable the installation of
third-party app stores and refrain from imposing unnecessary technical
restrictions. Yet Apple’s notarisation enforces the very dependency the
DMA prohibits: it reasserts Apple’s role as the
mandatory intermediary for every app on its platforms.
This undermines competition, discourages independent developers, and
excludes non-commercial, community-run projects that cannot afford to submit to Apple’s terms or
refuse to submit to them. Allowing this practice to persist
would water down the DMA’s promise before it is even tested.</p><h3 id="id-blocking-alternative-app-stores-with-extremely-high-requirements">Blocking alternative app stores with extremely high requirements</h3><p>Apple’s requirements for enabling third-party app stores are very
hard to meet. They have effectively prevented non-profit Free Software
app stores from working in iOS and iPadOS. The provision of a 1 million euro standby
letter of credit or 1 million downloads within a year in the EU
overburdens not only non-profits, but also individual developers,
startups, and SMEs. When these conditions are put into context, such
requirements do not reflect industry standards and expectations. They
derive from Apple’s monopolistic behaviour with respect to mobile devices. Such
impositions do not exist in Apple’s laptops and desktop computers, where
unfettered installation (sideloading) is a reality. The complaint
concludes that both requirements go beyond the limits of what is
necessary under the DMA. Apple ignores less restrictive alternatives
(e.g. insurance and escrow frameworks), and provides no justification
for doing so.</p><h3 id="id-the-solution-decentralised-software-curation">The solution: decentralised software curation </h3><p>The complaint surges the European Commission to impose fines and to
find an alternative to Apple’s control over software distribution,
including non-profit stakeholders in the process. The alternative to
Apple’s notarisation already exists, and it works.
<strong>Decentralised curation</strong>, as practised
by repositories like <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/"><strong>F-Droid</strong></a>,
shows that security and software freedom coexist inherently. Instead of
concentrating trust in a single private authority, decentralised systems
distribute it: through transparent verification pipelines, reproducible
builds, and community audits. Users choose whom to trust, and curators
are accountable to the public, not to corporate shareholders. This model
embodies the DMA’s vision of interoperability and openness far better
than Apple’s notarisation.</p><p>Such a model aligns with the DMA’s ambitions: interoperability,
transparency, and user choice. Decentralised curation can support
multiple overlapping trust networks, from individual developers to NGOs,
universities, or public institutions, each maintaining their own
repository policies. Instead of “millions of apps” buried in opaque
ranking algorithms, users could benefit from clearly defined,
community-led collections where the emphasis is on transparency,
privacy, and respect for user rights. Security is achieved not through
corporate secrecy but through diversity, peer review, and verifiable
integrity.</p><h3 id="id-what’s-next">What’s next?</h3><p>If the DMA is to live up to its potential, regulators must treat
Apple’s notarisation for what it is: a mechanism of control disguised as
a security feature. This civil-society complaint demonstrates that
Apple’s understanding of security undermines transparency, competition,
and user autonomy - hampering software freedom for everyone. It is not
genuine security, it is merely gatekeeping by another name. The European
Commission must ensure that compliance with the DMA means genuine
openness. The right to install, share, and verify software freely in any
device is not merely a technical issue; it is a matter of
<strong>freedom</strong>.</p><p id="discussion-link"><a href="https://mastodon.social/deck/@fsfe/115496552737948705">Discuss this </a></p></div></div>]]></description>
