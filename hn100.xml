</div><p>NASA has re-established contact with its tiny helicopter on Mars, the US space agency said Saturday, after an unexpected outage prompted fears that the hard-working craft had finally met its end.</p>


		    <!-- Phys.org - News - AMP -->
		

                    <p>Ingenuity, a drone about 1.6 feet (0.5 meters) tall, arrived on Mars in 2021 aboard the rover Perseverance and became the first motorized craft to fly autonomously on another planet.</p>
<p>Data from the helicopter are transmitted via Perseverance back to Earth, but communications were suddenly lost during a test flight on Thursday, Ingenuity's 72nd lift-off on Mars.</p>
<p>"Good news today," NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) wrote on X, formerly Twitter, late Saturday.</p>
<p>The agency said that contact had finally been made with the helicopter by commanding Perseverance to "perform long-duration listening sessions for Ingenuity's signal."</p>
<p>"The team is reviewing the new data to better understand the unexpected comms dropout during Flight 72," it added.</p>
<p>NASA previously said that Ingenuity had attained an altitude of 40 feet (12 meters) on Flight 72, which was a "quick pop-up vertical flight to check out the helicopter's systems, following an unplanned early landing during its previous flight."</p>
<p>But during its descent, "communications between the helicopter and rover terminated early, prior to touchdown," the agency said.</p>
<p>JPL had noted on Friday that Perseverance was temporarily "out of line-of-sight with Ingenuity, but the team could consider driving closer for a visual inspection."</p>
<p>In a response to a post on X asking if Ingenuity would be able to fly again, JPL said Saturday that "the team needs to assess the new data before that can be determined."</p>
<p>NASA has lost contact with the helicopter before, including for an agonizing two months last year.</p>
<p>The mini rotorcraft, which weighs just four pounds (1.8 kilograms), has far exceeded its original goal of undertaking five flights over 30 days on the red planet.</p>
<p>In all, it has covered just over 10 miles (17 kilometers) and reached altitudes of up to 79 feet (24 meters).</p>
<p>Its longevity has proved remarkable, particularly considering that it must survive glacially cold Martian nights, kept warm by the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/solar+panels/" rel="tag">solar panels</a> that recharge its batteries during daylight hours.</p>
<p>Working with Perseverance, it has acted as an aerial scout to assist its wheeled companion in searching for possible signs of ancient microbial life.</p>

        <div id="article-hfix">
            <div id="article-hstick-inner">
                                <p>Google has finally admitted that it tracks your search history, activities, the websites you visit and the services they use even in Incognito mode. Following the search engine's agreement to settle a $5 billion USD privacy lawsuit that accused it of tracking users illegally in incognito mode, it has now updated the disclaimer to reflect the transparency. In its Canary version (Early-access version which allows users and developers to test new features and updates before they are rolled out for everyone), Google now states that data will still be collected even in Incognito mode.</p>
<p>The normal disclaimer which you can see in Incognito mode at the moment is- "Now you can browse privately, and other people who use this device won’t see your activity. However, downloads, bookmarks and reading list items will be saved." However, in the Canary version, the disclaimer reads, "Others who use this device won’t see your activity, so you can browse more privately. This won’t change how data is collected by websites you visit and the services they use, including Google. Downloads, bookmarks and reading list items will be saved."</p>
<h2><span>Why Does It Make A Difference?</span></h2>
<p>Speculations of the search engine tracking users in the incognito mode were always there but Google never confirmed that it continues to track users despite them being in incognito mode. However, now, after putting up this disclaimer, it has clarified that indeed does track your activities. Notably, this does not mean that Google is now starting to track your activities and was not doing so before. It means that they were doing that earlier as well but now they have admitted to it finally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users must be cautious about using Google even in incognito mode as it is not just the search engine that tracks you but the websites also do. Are you one of the people who used to open the incognito mode to book flight tickets so that you could avoid surge prices? You might encounter that surge now as both Google as well as the ticket-selling website will be tracking your activity.</p>

What can humans learn from them?</p></div></header></div><div><p>Angler Stuart Black has caught a lot of fish in his days, but when he landed his first buffalofish in <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destination/arizona" target="_blank">Arizona</a>’s Apache Lake in 2019, he had a hunch something was special about it.</p><p>“I didn’t even know why at the time,” he says. At 13 pounds, it wasn’t even that big—he’s caught bigger.</p><p>Turns out, his intuition was right. Scientists recently confirmed that the majority of the buffalofish swimming around this remote desert lake in eastern Arizona are older than a hundred.</p><p>The discovery builds on other recent research that has upended beliefs about the little-studied buffalofish, a genus of five <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/facts/freshwater-fish" target="_blank">freshwater fish</a> species native to North America.</p><p>Just a few years ago, scientists thought that these fish, which come in an array of colors from chestnut brown to bluish, only lived into their mid-20s. However, a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0452-0" target="_blank">2019 study</a> revealed that <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/oldest-freshwater-fish-discovered-radiocarbon-dating" target="_blank">bigmouth buffalofish could live up to 112 years old</a>, making it the oldest known freshwater teleost, a group of about 12,000 ray-finned fish species found worldwide. Then in January, researchers <a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjfas-2022-0122" target="_blank">announced the discovery of a 127-year-old bigmouth</a> in Saskatchewan, Canada.</p><p>Now, the new study, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-44328-8" target="_blank">published recently in <i>Scientific Reports</i></a><i>,</i> confirmed that two more buffalofish species—the smallmouth buffalo and the black buffalo—can live more than a hundred years, making it the only known genus of animal besides the marine rockfish, <i>Sebastes,&nbsp;</i>that has three centenarian species.<b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>This is not to say that other animals can’t achieve remarkably long life spans. <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/greenland-sharks-animals-science-age" target="_blank">Greenland sharks have the greatest longevity of any living vertebrate</a>, reaching at least 250 years old.</p><p>What’s more, research has revealed that buffalofish continue to live their best lives into their upper 80s and 90s, with better stress response and immune function relative to younger individuals. <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/flamingo-albatross-longevity-clam" target="_blank"><i>(See six of the world’s longest-lived animals.)</i></a></p><p>“The one takeaway is that buffalofishes do not conform to preconceived notions,” says study leader <a href="https://scse.d.umn.edu/faculty-staff/alec-lackmann" target="_blank">Alec Lackmann</a>, a fish expert at the University of Minnesota. “They defy expectations.”</p><h2><b>Desert discovery</b></h2><p>For the Arizona study, a few dozen anglers, including Black, caught 222 buffalofish at Apache Lake from July 2018 to July 2023. Twenty three were humanely euthanized and donated to the research team, who estimated the fishes’ ages by removing and analyzing tiny ear stones called otoliths. These calcium carbonate structures, which allow fish to hear and sense vibrations in the water, form a new layer each year that can be read somewhat like tree rings.</p><p>The otolith analysis revealed that about 90 percent of Apache Lake’s buffalofishes were more than 85 years old. Researchers aged individuals of all three species studied there—smallmouth buffalo, bigmouth buffalo, and black buffalo—past a hundred years old.</p><p>For the other 199 fish, the anglers used a technique called catch-photo-release, in which they reeled in fish with tiny barbed or no-barbed hooks that avoid hurting the animal. All were photographed, and 129 were weighed before releasing them back into the lake. Researchers estimated live fishes’ ages by studying orange and black spots in the anglers’ photographs.</p><p>“Several species of large riverine fishes like sturgeon and alligator gar are known to live more than 50 years,” says Nathan Farnau, curator of fishes and invertebrates at the <a href="http://www.georgiaaquarium.org/" target="_blank">Georgia Aquarium</a> in Atlanta, who wasn’t involved in the study.</p><p>“But it’s always really exciting when researchers can find physical evidence of fish that are more than a hundred years old."</p><h2><b>Hardy non-natives</b></h2><p>What makes these findings even more remarkable, Lackmann says, is that these fish aren’t even native to the state. About 400 of them arrived to Arizona by rail in 1918 as part of a U.S. Bureau of Fisheries plan to establish a commercial fishery in Roosevelt Lake, a dammed reservoir on the Salt River. Apache Lake, part of the same river system, was later established and some of the fish eventually migrated there by swimming downstream.</p><p>The bigmouth buffalo’s native range spans from southern Saskatchewan down into Texas and Louisiana, with smallmouth and black buffalo sharing similar ranges that also include parts of Ontario, New Mexico, and Mexico. The fish in Apache Lake likely came from a hatchery in Iowa, Lackmann says.</p><p>He adds that the new findings indicate that some of the original stockfish still live in the Salt River system. <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/110609-coelacanths-long-lived-fish-science-animals" target="_blank"><i>(Read about coelacanths, an ancient fish that can reach a hundred years.)</i></a></p><p>“It's like a rugged desert environment in that reservoir, yet they still are able to persist across a century,” Lackmann says. “Just imagine taking a wild animal and putting it in a novel habitat like that. If anything, you would expect they wouldn't live as long.”</p><h2><b>Fountain of youth?</b></h2><p>Buffalofish can go decades between successful reproductions because they require very specific environmental conditions—most of which are still unknown—to procreate. That’s why the fish evolved to live so long: It’s an evolutionary adaptation to account for long periods without breeding, according to Lackmann.</p><p>In Saskatchewan, where buffalofish can go up to 50 years without producing offspring, the fish only attempt to spawn within a narrow range of water-level fluctuations that may rarely occur.</p><p>Lackmann says further studies into buffalofish longevity could provide insight into how vertebrates, including humans, can live longer. <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/aging-cure-longevity-science-technology-feature" target="_blank"><i>(Read: “Can aging be cured? Scientists are giving it a try.”)</i></a></p><p>“One of the major outstanding questions about the buffalofishes is how they do it in terms of their amazing longevity. What is their fountain of youth?”</p><p>One strategy may be understanding why older buffalofish are less stressed and have stronger immunity than younger fish, which was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-88626-5" target="_blank">confirmed in a 2021 study on bigmouth buffalofish</a>.</p><p>Older individuals could fight off bacteria better than younger animals. Not only that, the elderly fish had a lower ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes in the blood, an indication of lower stress levels.</p><p>“They are still advancing into prime condition at a century old, which is astonishing,” Lackmann says.</p><p>Meanwhile, conservation is a priority, he says. Buffalofish are a prized sportfish in the upper Midwest, and while their numbers are declining, harvest is virtually unregulated—including in Arizona.</p><p>“Right now, you can go to Apache Lake, catch a buffalofish, and just take it home,” Black says. “So for me, getting them protected now is probably the most important thing.”</p></div></article></section></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span>We live in undeniably ugly times.</span> Architecture, industrial design, cinematography, probiotic soda branding — many of the defining features of the visual field aren’t sending their best. Despite more advanced manufacturing and design technologies than have existed in human history, our built environment tends overwhelmingly toward the insubstantial, the flat, and the gray, punctuated here and there by the occasional childish squiggle. This drab sublime unites flat-pack furniture and home electronics, municipal infrastructure and commercial graphic design: an ocean of stuff so homogenous and underthought that the world it has inundated can feel like a digital rendering — of a slightly duller, worse world.</span></p><p><span>If the Situationists drifted through Paris looking to get defamiliarized, today a scholar of the new ugliness can conduct their research in any contemporary American city — or upzoned American Main Street, or exurban American parking lot, or, if they’re really desperate, on the empty avenues of Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Our own walk begins across the street from our apartment, where, following the recent demolition of a perfectly serviceable hundred-year-old building, a monument to ugliness has recently besieged the block. Our new neighbor is a classic 5-over-1: retail on the ground floor, topped with several stories of apartments one wouldn’t want to be able to afford. The words <span>THE JOSH</span> have been appended to the canopy above the main entrance in a passionless font.</span></p><p><span>We spent the summer certain that the caution tape–yellow panels on The Josh’s south side were insulation, to be eventually supplanted by an actual facade. Alas, in its finished form The Josh really is yellow, and also burgundy, gray, and brown. Each of these colors corresponds to a different material — plastic, concrete, rolled-on brick, an obscure wood-like substance — and the overall effect is of an overactive spreadsheet. Trims, surfaces, and patterns compete for attention with shifty black windows, but there’s nothing bedazzling or flamboyant about all this chaos. Somehow the building’s plane feels flatter than it is, despite the profusion of arbitrary outcroppings and angular balconies. The lineage isn’t Bauhaus so much as a sketch of the Bauhaus that’s been xeroxed half a dozen times.</span></p><p><span>The Josh is aging rapidly for a 5-month-old. There are gaps between the panels, which have a taped-on look to them, and cracks in the concrete. Rust has bloomed on surfaces one would typically imagine to be rustproof. Every time it rains, The Josh gets conspicuously . . . wet. Attempts have been made to classify structures like this one and the ethos behind their appearance: SimCityist, McCentury Modern, fast-casual architecture. We prefer cardboard modernism, in part because The Josh looks like it might turn to pulp at the first sign of a hundred-year flood.</span></p><p><span>Writing a century ago, H. L. Mencken bemoaned America’s “libido for the ugly.” There exists, he wrote, a “love of ugliness for its own sake, the lust to make the world intolerable. Its habitat is the United States.” However mystical and psychosexual his era’s intolerability might have felt in its origins, by the 1940s the explanations were more prosaic. With the wartime rationing of steel and sudden dearth of skilled labor, concrete structural systems quickly gained appeal — as did buildings that could be made piecemeal in a factory, put on a trailer, and nailed together anywhere in the country. And as the postwar baby boom took hold, such buildings were soon in high demand, fulfilling modernism’s wildest dreams of standardization with little of the glamour. A few Levittowns later, the promise of salvation-by-mass-production would come to seem elusive: new manufacturing techniques were transforming both the buildings and the builders building them. In </span><i><span>Prisoners of the American Dream</span></i><span>, Mike Davis describes how, in the 1970s, “the adoption of new building technologies involving extensive use of prefabricated structures, like precast concrete, eroded the boundaries of traditional skills and introduced a larger semi-skilled component into the labor force.” If it’s cheaper to assemble concrete panels than to hire bricklayers, cityscapes will eventually contain fewer bricks.</span></p><p><span>A construction industry with newly decadent profit margins was ready to spring into action in the 1990s, when — after a violent, decades-long process of urban renewal and white flight — real estate developers, brokers, and local politicians started luring predominantly white homeowners and renters back to the cities they’d abandoned. By the 2000s, infill housing began to crop up in American cities that had for decades been defined by their plentiful surface parking. These residential developments were ugly, but not yet inescapable. Like the fresh-faced presidential candidate with whom it’s hard not to associate them (did every wood-and-concrete complex feature a knockoff Shepard Fairey mural, or have we been blinded by the mists of memory?), the buildings spoke to an upwardly mobile, progressive, even post-racial demographic that didn’t share its parents’ all-consuming fear of city life. Then came the ultimate stop-work order: the 2008 financial crisis.</span></p><blockquote><p>The ruling class seized cities and chose to turn them into . . . this? To our right is a place that sells wiggly candles.</p> <a onclick="return popitup('https://twitter.com/share?text=The+ruling+class+seized+cities+and+chose+to+turn+them+into%E2%80%AF.%E2%80%AF.%E2%80%AF.+this%3F+To+our+right+is+a+place+that+sells+wiggly+candles.+%7C+n%2B1+%7C&amp;lang=en&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nplusonemag.com%2F%3Fp%3D34098')" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=The+ruling+class+seized+cities+and+chose+to+turn+them+into%E2%80%AF.%E2%80%AF.%E2%80%AF.+this%3F+To+our+right+is+a+place+that+sells+wiggly+candles.+%7C+n%2B1+%7C&amp;lang=en&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nplusonemag.com%2F%3Fp%3D34098">Tweet</a></blockquote><p><span>The urban building boom that picked up in the wake of the Great Recession wasn’t a boom at all, at least not by previous booming standards: in the early 2010s, multifamily housing construction was at its lowest in decades. But low interest rates worked in developers’ favor, and what had begun as an archipelago of scattered development had coalesced, by the end of the Obama years, into a visual monoculture. At the global scale, supply chains narrowed the range of building materials to a generic minimum (hence The Josh’s pileup of imitation teak accents and synthetic stucco antiflourishes). At the local level, increasingly stringent design standards imposed by ever-more-cumbersome community approval processes compelled developers to copy designs that had already been rubber-stamped elsewhere (hence that same fake teak and stucco in identical boxy buildings across the country). The environment this concatenation of forces has produced is at once totalizing and meek — an architecture embarrassed by its barely architected-ness, a building style that cuts corners and then covers them with rainscreen cladding. For all the air these buildings have sucked up in the overstated conflict between YIMBYs (who recognize that new housing is ultimately better than no housing) and NIMBYs (who don’t), the unmistakable fact of cardboard modernism is that its buildings are less ambitious, less humane, and uglier than anyone deserves.</span></p><p><span>They’re also really gray. The Josh’s steel railings are gray, and its plastic window sashes are a slightly clashing shade of gray. Inside, the floors are made of gray TimberCore, and the walls are painted an abject post-beige that interior designers call greige but is in fact just gray. Gray suffuses life beyond architecture: television, corporate logos, product packaging, clothes for babies, direct-to-consumer toothbrushes. What incentives — material, libidinal, or otherwise — could possibly account for all this gray? In 2020, a study by London’s Science Museum Group’s Digital Lab used image processing to analyze photographs of consumer objects manufactured between 1800 and the present. They found that things have become less colorful over time, converging on a spectrum between steel and charcoal, as though consumers want their gadgets to resemble the raw materials of the industries that produce them. If </span><i><span>The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit </span></i><span>once offered a warning about conformity, he is now an inspiration, although the outfit has gotten an upgrade. Today he is </span><i><span>The Man in the Gray Bonobos</span></i><span>,</span> <span>or </span><i><span>The Man in the</span></i> <i><span>Gray Buck Mason Crew Neck</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>The Man in the Gray Mack Weldon Sweatpants</span></i><span> — all delivered via gray Amazon van. The imagined color of life under communism, gray has revealed itself to be the actual hue of globalized capital. “The distinct national colors of the imperialist map of the world have merged and blended in the imperial global rainbow,” wrote Hardt and Negri. What color does a blended rainbow produce? Greige, evidently.</span></p><hr><p><span><span>A lot of ugliness</span> accretes privately, in the form of household goods, which can make it hard to see — except on the first of the month. Today’s perma-class of renters moves more frequently than ever before (inevitably to smaller apartments), and on moving day the sidewalks are transformed into a rich bazaar of objects significant for ugliness studies. We stroll past discarded pottery from wild sip ’n’ spin nights; heaps of shrunken fast fashion from Shein; dead Strategist-approved houseplants; broken Wirecutter-approved humidifiers; an ergonomic gaming chair; endless Ikea BILLYs, MALMs, LACKs, SKUBBs, BARENs, SLOGGs, JUNQQs, and FGHSKISs. Perhaps this shelf is salvageable — ? No, just another mass of peeling veneer and squishy particleboard. On one stoop sits a package from a direct-to-consumer eyewear company, and we briefly fantasize about a pair of glasses that would illuminate, </span><i><span>They Live</span></i><span>–style, the precise number of children involved in manufacturing each of these trashed items, or maybe the acreage of Eastern European old-growth trees.</span></p><p><span>It occurs to us, strolling past a pair of broken BuzzFeed Shopping–approved AirPods, that the new ugliness has beset us from both above and below. Many of the aesthetic qualities pioneered by low-interest-rate-era construction — genericism, non-ornamentation, shoddy reproducibility — have trickled down into other realms, even as other principles, unleashed concurrently by Apple’s slick industrial-design hegemon, have trickled up. In the middle, all that is solid melts into sameness, such that smart home devices resemble the buildings they surveil, which in turn look like the computers on which they were algorithmically engineered, which resemble the desks on which they sit, which, like the sofas at the coworking space around the corner, put the </span><i><span>mid</span></i><span> in </span><i><span>fake midcentury modern</span></i><span>. And all of it is bound by the commandment of planned obsolescence, which decays buildings even as it turns phones into bricks.</span></p><p><span>Beyond the sidewalk, the street — which is mostly for cars, key technology of the 20th-century assault on the city. Barthes wrote that the 1955 Citroën DS marked a welcome shift in the appearance in cars toward the “homely,” meaning that they’d begun to carry the comfortable livability of kitchens and household equipment. Today’s automobiles, far from being “the supreme creation of an era,” are homely in the other sense of the word. A contemporary mythologist could sort them into either hamsters or monoliths. Hamster cars (the Honda Fit, the Toyota Prius) are undoubtedly ugly, but in a virtuous way. The monolith cars (the Cadillac Escalade, the Infiniti QX80) possess a militaristic cast, as if to get to Costco one must first stop off at the local black site.<sup id="rf1-34098"><a href="#fn1-34098" title="See also the increasing dominance of cars with opaque and foreboding matte paint jobs, described by the newsletter Blackbird Spyplane as “putty-lookin’ ass whips.”">1</a></sup> <span>No brand has embraced the ethos more than Tesla, with its tanklike Cybertruck. Even Musk’s more domesticated offerings feel like they’re in the surveillance business: sitting inside a Tesla is not unlike sitting inside a smartphone, while also staring at a giant smartphone.</span></span></p><blockquote><p>Shittiness is a big tent — and the tent is falling apart.</p> <a onclick="return popitup('https://twitter.com/share?text=Shittiness+is+a+big+tent%E2%80%8A%E2%80%94%E2%80%8Aand+the+tent+is+falling+apart.+%7C+n%2B1+%7C&amp;lang=en&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nplusonemag.com%2F%3Fp%3D34098')" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Shittiness+is+a+big+tent%E2%80%8A%E2%80%94%E2%80%8Aand+the+tent+is+falling+apart.+%7C+n%2B1+%7C&amp;lang=en&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nplusonemag.com%2F%3Fp%3D34098">Tweet</a></blockquote><p><span>Dodging huge grilles we walk on, pulled by ugliness toward a gentrified retail strip. Here the violence of the new ugliness comes more fully into focus. The ruling class seized cities and chose to turn them into . . . this? To our right is a place that sells wiggly candles. Past that is a boutique liquor store whose chalkboard sign proclaims, in cheerleader handwriting, that the time is Wine O’Clock, and past that is a Bank of America. Across the street, a row of fast-casual chains, whose names and visual identities insist on modesty and anonymity: Just Salad, Just Food For Dogs, Blank Street Coffee. (This raft of normcore brands finds its opposite in the ghost kitchens down the block, which all for some reason are called things like Fuck Your Little Bitch Burrito.) Up ahead is an axe throwing “experience,” and another Bank of America.</span></p><p><span>Who asked for all of this? Numerous critics — self-hating and otherwise — have argued that the mallification of the American city is the fault of the same millennials for whom all the new construction was built, who couldn’t quite bear to abandon the creature comforts of home even as they reurbanized. The story goes that millennials lived, laughed, and loved their way into an unprecedentedly insipid environment, turning once-gritty cities into Instagram-friendly dispensaries of baroque ice cream cones that call back, madeleine-style, to the enfolding warmth of their suburban childhoods. But the contemporary built environment is not the millennials’ legacy; it is their inheritance. They didn’t ask for cardboard modernism — they simply capitulate to its infantilizing aesthetic paradigm because there is no alternative. Or if there is an alternative, it’s between an $8 ice cream cone or an $11 ice cream cone (or a $49 ticket to the Museum of Ice Cream).</span></p><p><span>Our ugliness tour is leading us toward the $11 ice cream cone zone. On the waterfront, the spatial logic of The Josh persists, only at four times the cost per square foot. There is less random yellow, the concrete is glossier, and the view through the precarious glass is a little more ennobling. Too bad about the build quality. One paradox of the new ugliness is that it flattens the distinction between the rich, the very rich, the superrich, and the merely fortunate by ripping them all off in turn. These days housing at the most elite strata sucks nearly as much as the simply bourgeois kind. According to a parade of entertaining </span><i><span>New York Times</span></i><span> stories, residents of the toothpick-like towers on Manhattan’s Billionaires’ Row complain of elevator breakdowns, “catastrophic” flooding from poor plumbing, and “metal partitions [that] groan as buildings sway” in the wind. Shittiness is a big tent — and the tent is falling apart.</span></p><hr><p><span><span>Our dérive has</span> deposited us near a subway stop. We swipe in with a trusty MetroCard, soon to be replaced by the privately owned data-tracking behemoth OMNY, whose neon-on-black logo recalls the chilly visual identity of another threat to transit, Uber.<sup id="rf2-34098"><a href="#fn2-34098" title="Along with Molly Fischer’s 2020 study of the “millennial aesthetic” in New York, Jesse Barron’s 2016 essay in Real Life remains an authoritative critique of neoliberal startup semiotics, from Uber to Seamless. “In 2012, Uber stood alone. Black, sinister, efficient. The logo like devil’s horns. The invisible umlaut. In the place of cuteness, Uber offered a fantasy of minimalist sadism, with the user holding the whip.”">2</a></sup> But at least as far as branding goes, OMNY is no uglier than other offenders. Our train car is covered in ads, all curiously alike despite marketing a staggering variety of superfluous stuff. How did workplace management systems, body-positive nutritional supplements, bean-forward meal kits, woman-owned sex toys, and woman-owned day-trading services all converge on the same three fonts? Everywhere we look there are little pool noodle–shaped squiggles, and where the squiggles end, there is muted flash photography that makes even otherworldly models look matter-of-fact. With the exception of the food delivery apps, which flaunt their violent takeover of the city in a meaningless word salad designed for shouting about salad —<span> WHEN YOU’RE SO HANGRY, YOU’D TRASH TALK ANY SLOW WALKER BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR BEC</span>, goes one GrubHub ad — the advertising all seems sheepish about being caught in the act of selling something.</span></p><p><span>But no single ad is as emblematically ugly as the digital screens that have appeared across the city’s train cars since 2017. Public transit has pivoted to video, and the function of its new giant iPads mystifies: their purpose is neither civic nor fully commercial. Instead, they’re given over to a bewildering set of images for the TikTokified city, the worst of which belong to a marketing campaign called “Moments in Food.” We watch, a little nauseated, as the Moments loop by: video tutorials for Homemade Pesto Hack, Homemade Chipotle Chicken Cutlet Hack, Homemade Three-Ingredient Oven-Free Blondie Hack. Why are there no measurements? Would this even seem edible, in the distinctly non-subwaylike atmosphere of an actual kitchen? Like The Josh’s synthetic not-quite-surfaces, it all seems gesturally foodlike, a step removed from the real thing. Above us, pesto glistens.</span></p><p><span>Speaking of moments in food, it’s lunchtime. Exiting the train, we pass a food hall, where, again, the theoretical possibility of endless variety manifests as lackluster sameness. Dozens of restaurants’ satellite stalls all feature the same signage, the same subway tile backdrop, the same impression of having been shrunk to diorama size and turned into IP. We turn instead to the outdoor dining sheds. After sprouting with uncharacteristic speed in the first chaotic spring of the pandemic, the sheds have performed a sort of guerilla Haussmannization of the city — in a good way, clawing back public space from cars. The ugliness they’ve introduced to the built environment diverges, happily, from the usual kind. Unruly and old-school, the sheds have pissed off deranged community boards and their mouthpieces in the media. “The shanty outside Dumpling Man on St. Marks is unspeakably hideous,” declared a recent </span><i><span>New York</span></i><span> article, “its colorless wood fragments hammered together so arbitrarily that you would rather eat in a pile of Lincoln Logs.” Yeah — just the way we like it!</span></p><p><span>Around the corner is a movie theater, one of those places where they bring snacks or cocktails right to your seat. Filmmaking today is supposed to be more powerful than it’s ever been, capable of representing everything everywhere all at once. As the world offscreen recedes into sameness, movies can and should look great — but onscreen there is more ugly sameness. The thing we wander into is at first indistinguishable from any other blockbuster of the late green-screen era: only after Ryan Reynolds cocks his signature “terror gun” do we recognize this as </span><i><span>Army Soldier II</span></i><span>,</span> <span>a digitally shot Netflix-financed production based on a TV show based on a comic book. Can a movie be a remake of itself? This is the depleted vibe </span><i><span>Army Soldier II</span></i><span> and its ilk are giving off. The easy recourse to postproduction — “we’ll fix it in post” — has resulted in a mise-en-scène so underlit as to be literally invisible. Despite its $275 million budget, the movie looks like it was filmed underwater in a polluted lake. The action scenes are nearly monochromatic, the color palette ranging from Tentative Black to what looks like Apple’s proprietary Space Gray. Lighting isn’t a lost art, but subsumed in all that murk, we’re having trouble finding it.</span></p><blockquote><p>Our neighbor to the right tells us she was hit by a Tesla while e-biking to Roosevelt Island to deliver a single unicorn latte.</p> <a onclick="return popitup('https://twitter.com/share?text=Our+neighbor+to+the+right+tells+us+she+was+hit+by+a+Tesla+while+e-biking+to+Roosevelt+Island+to+deliver+a+single+unicorn+latte.+%7C+n%2B1+%7C&amp;lang=en&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nplusonemag.com%2F%3Fp%3D34098')" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Our+neighbor+to+the+right+tells+us+she+was+hit+by+a+Tesla+while+e-biking+to+Roosevelt+Island+to+deliver+a+single+unicorn+latte.+%7C+n%2B1+%7C&amp;lang=en&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nplusonemag.com%2F%3Fp%3D34098">Tweet</a></blockquote><p><span>Two and a half hours in, </span><i><span>Army Soldier II </span></i><span>suddenly becomes a comedy, with Reynolds vamping his way through long, flat takes designed to accommodate his “riffs.” Now everything is </span><i><span>over</span></i><span>lit, as if the gaffers were only available for the second half of the shoot.</span></p><p><span>Such bad lighting</span><span> — and such large portions! We exit the movie theater to a bright realization: our films are exactly as overlit as our reality. As our environment has become blander, it has also become more legible — too legible. That’s a shame, because many products of the new ugliness could benefit from a little chiaroscuroed ambiguity: if the world has to fill itself up with smart teapots, app-operated vacuum cleaners, and creepily huge menswear, we’d prefer it all to be shrouded in darkness. For thousands of years, this was the principle of illumination that triumphed over all others. Louis XIV’s Versailles and Louis the Tavern Owner’s tavern had this in common: the recognition that some details are worth keeping hidden. But now blinding illumination is the default condition of every apartment, office, pharmacy, laundromat, print shop, sandwich shop, train station, airport, grocery store, UPS Store, tattoo parlor, bank, and this vape shop we’ve just walked into.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Surveying a suite of candy-colored bongs, we reflect on the primacy of LEDs. (One of the bongs is bedecked with LEDs.) The shift to cold lighting in recent years was borne of urgent environmental necessity, and we accept that climate change requires concessions. We’re prepared to make those: we will eat crickets and endorse, if necessary, the blockage of the waterfront park around the corner by a giant seawall. We will even help build the seawall! Change is inevitable. But LEDs can appear in many colors, as demonstrated by our new light-up bong. So why this atomic, lobotomizing white?</span></p><p><span>Outdoors, the situation is depressingly similar. After New York replaced the sodium-vapor lights in the city’s 250,000 streetlamps with shiny new LEDs in 2017, the experience of walking through the city at night transformed, almost . . . overnight. Forgiving, romantic, shadowy orange gave way to cold, all-seeing bluish white. Again environmental concerns necessitate this scale of change, and again we wonder why, when it comes to its light bulbs, New York has chosen to back the blue. Inertia, disinterest, thoughtlessness, yes, but also the promise of increased police vigilance. Still, what is most striking about New York’s ominous glow-up is the sense that the city has been estranged from itself: the hyperprecise shadows of every leaf and every branch set against every brick wall deliver a Hollywood unreality. New York after hours now looks less like it did in Scorsese’s </span><i><span>After Hours </span></i><span>and more like an excessive set-bound ’60s production. The new ugliness is defined in part by an abandonment of function </span><i><span>and </span></i><span>form: buildings afraid to look like buildings, cars that look like renderings, restaurants that look like the apps that control them. New York City is a city increasingly in quotation marks, a detailed facsimile of a place.</span></p><p><span>Gah! Blinded by the intense glare of an LED streetlamp, we bump right into said streetlamp. Fortunately there’s an urgent care across the street, still open in the dwindling dusk. We’re no doctor — at least not until they start giving out PhDs in walking around — but we can tell that our knee is bleeding. If anything is broken, the CityMD’s MD will take care of it. We stumble inside, into the intersection of exploitative private insurance and inadequate public options. Here, like everywhere else, a clash of patterns and surfaces — gray tile, gray bricks, greige wood paneling — enfolds us in a numbing palliative aura. We try to check in at the front, but the iPad doesn’t react to the tap of our index finger. Are we a ghost? Is this the afterlife? The lighting is giving gates of heaven, but as with the supertall buildings and their elevators that never work, our problem is technical: the iPad is frozen. Another one is wheeled out and we make our way through a questionnaire. Allergic reactions? None. History of medical litigation? Huh, weird.</span></p><p><span>Our estimated wait time is three and a half hours, which gives us ample opportunity to reflect on our surroundings. Is there a more contemporary urban form than the urgent care facility? How did the entire world come to look like this nonplace, flimsy and artificial and built unsuccessfully to stave off emergency? Above our heads, the original </span><i><span>Army Soldier</span></i><span> plays on a flatscreen, Ryan Reynolds’s leaden features motion-smoothed into alarming definition. Our phone buzzes with a push notification from Zillow: a 0.5-bedroom studio is now available for $4,775 a month in the sub-basement of The Josh. We examine our fellow patients, because nobody else is. The bleeding young man to our left looks to have been the victim of an axe throw gone very wrong. Our neighbor to the right tells us she was hit by a Tesla while e-biking to Roosevelt Island to deliver a single unicorn latte. We overhear someone behind us describe a harrowing food poisoning incident involving a Homemade Chipotle Chicken Cutlet Hack.</span></p><p><span>In the end we pay $75 for a Band-Aid, two Advils, a Blank Street Coffee gift card, and a branded pen we have no plans to return.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18n30jn/i_believe_bestselling_author_mark_dawson_is_a/">https://old.reddit.com/r/books/comments/18n30jn/i_believe_bestselling_author_mark_dawson_is_a/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39077223">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you don’t know who Mark Dawson is, he’s a self-published author who has 203,722 ratings on Goodreads. He says himself that his books have had over 6 million downloads (including both paid and free promotional copies). He runs the Self Publishing Formula course and podcast, he talks at the 20BooksTo50K conference in Vegas, and he’s part of a new initiative called Fuse Publishing. He’s a pretty big deal in self-publishing, so what he does reflects on self-publishing as a whole.</p>

<p>I was wondering how this guy published so many books in so little time and I found my answer: he stole a lot of his material.</p>

<ul>
<li>[2013 William Boyd interviews James Bond by William Boyd from the Guardian] “the gaudy harlequinade of youth much in evidence”</li>
<li>[2014 The Driver by Mark Dawson] “The harlequinade of youth much in evidence”</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li>[2013 William Boyd interviews James Bond by William Boyd from the Guardian] “the dark-eyed girls in their short dresses and the long-haired young men in crushed velvet and fur-trimmed Afghans"</li>
<li>[2014 The Driver by Mark Dawson] “Long-haired young men in vintage suits and fur-trimmed Afghans, and girls in short dresses”</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li>[2012 <em>Annecy shootings: On a steep forest road, few signs of the horror that was</em> by John Lichfield for the Independent] “The misty slopes of the massif of the Montagne de Charbon tower above the treeline”</li>
<li>[2013 The Cleaner by Mark Dawson] “The misty slopes of the massif of the Montagne de Charbon stretched above the treeline”</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li>[2009 I, Sniper: A Bob Lee Swagger Novel by Stephen Hunter] “He settled in, feeling the tension in the trigger, finding his stock weld, sliding to the eyepiece, and seeing the world through the mil-dot-rich reticle…”</li>
<li>[2014 Tarantula by Mark Dawson] “The man settled behind the rifle. He felt the tension in the trigger, found his stockweld and slid up to the eyepiece, staring into it and seeing the ridge and the trees and the vegetation through the mil-dot-rich reticle.”</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li>[2009 I, Sniper: A Bob Lee Swagger Novel by Stephen Hunter] ”Then pulling out his Kestral 4000 weather station and noting the wind, humidity, and temperature.”</li>
<li>[2014 Tarantula by Mark Dawson] “Took out a small weather station and noted the wind, the humidity, and temperature.”</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li>[2009 I, Sniper: A Bob Lee Swagger Novel by Stephen Hunter] “He dialed the first into the scope of the rifle, clicking mostly elevation but some windage, for there was a drift of light wind that rustled undulations in the grass.</li>
<li>[2014 Tarantula by Mark Dawson] “The trees were rustling a little in a light breeze that was running in off the sea […] He dialled the first into the scope of the rifle, making adjustments for windage.”</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li>[2009 I, Sniper: A Bob Lee Swagger Novel by Stephen Hunter]  “… the smell of the cleaning fluid, the touch of hand to comb, cheek to fiberglass, finger to trigger”</li>
<li>[2014 Tarantula by Mark Dawson] “… the smell of the cleaning fluid that had been used on its metallic parts, the cold touch of the aluminum eyepiece against his eye socket. He felt the chill of the fibreglass stock against his cheek.”</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li>[2010 Amexica: War Along the Borderline by Ed Vulliamy] “We pass the iron girder skeleton of a building that never seems to get finished”</li>
<li>[2013 Saint Death Mark Dawson] “Milton passed the iron girder skeleton of a building”</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li>[2010 Amexica: War Along the Borderline by Ed Vulliamy] “little shops, outlets for cocaine, marijuana, synthetic drugs, and heroin—which in Juarez are called picaderos, usually marked by a shoe tied to a nearby telegraph wire”</li>
<li>[2013 Saint Death Mark Dawson] “Milton knew about Juarez […] Illicit outlets—picaderos—were marked out by shoes slung over nearby telegraph wires, and their shifty proprietors sold whatever illicit substance you needed to get high”</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li>An older version of Saint Death said “Illicit outlets––picaderos––were marked out by shoes slung over nearby telegraph wires and their shifty proprietors sold cocaine, marijuana, synthetic drugs and heroin. The legitimate marketplace at Cerrajeros was busy with custom, a broad sweep of unwanted bric-a-brac for sale: discarded furniture, soda fountains, hair curlers, Kelvinator fridges.” but he changed it. So it was even more plagiarized before. You can look it up in Google and it’ll show up, though it leads to a weird scam site which will try to convince you that you have a virus on your computer but I still think that counts as proof as I’m assuming the scam site simply copied an older version of his book verbatim before he sent out an update through Kindle to cover up his more blatant plagiarism.</li>
<li>This also matches up to another passage from Amexica: “… lines the streets in overload quantities: sixties furniture, soda fountains, hair curlers, Kelvinator cookers and Osterizer blenders…” So Mark changed sixties furniture to discarded furniture and Kelvinator cookers to Kelvinator fridges. Nice.</li>
</ul>

<p>And I found all this in an hour or two, just looking at a few of his books, and only looking at the first few pages which were available for free in the Kindle sample and typing suspicious sentences into Google. He’s probably plagiarized a lot more and hidden it with after-the-fact edits and rearranging words in a way that’s harder to check using a search engine.</p>

<p>Basic rule: read through one of his books and type any phrase that seems either interesting and profound or technical about matters he’s not familiar with like guns into Google in quotes. You’ll probably find that he took it from somewhere else.</p>

<p>“Harlequins of youth much in evidence?” Never heard that sentence before. Oh, he didn’t write it.</p>

<p>“Fur-trimmed Afghans?” What are those? Oh, he probably doesn’t know either. Because he didn’t write it.</p>

<p>“Misty slopes of the massif” “Mil-dot-rich reticle” “iron girder skeleton of a building” etc.</p>

<p>For original prose you get clunky purple prose like “the sun glared down, a myriad of shafts that lanced into his eyes.” I mean, a myriad of shafts sounds like you’re talking about golf clubs or genitals. I would HOPE neither of those are lancing you in the eye.</p>

<p>It seems unfair that he’s reportedly sold 6 million books and is so involved in these groups while heavily plagiarizing when books like <em>How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life</em> get cancelled entirely for plagiarism. But maybe in self-publishing things just work differently. But I feel like an author who sells 6 million books should be held to a higher standard whether they’re self-published or not.</p>

<p>(If this was not the right sub to post something like this, then I apologize and I'll take it down. I just thought more people should know about this because it seems like most of his fans have no idea he plagiarizes.)</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>EDIT: A previous of this version incorrectly stated that Mark Dawson wrote 20 books in 2 years. This was based on a cursory look of his Wikipedia page, where it seems to suggest he published 20 books (meaning both novels and novellas) from 2013 to 2015. However, it has been brought to my attention that many people took 'book' to mean full-length novel, not novella, and that a lot of these books had either been written previously and were just now being published, or had listed co-authors. So 20 novels and novellas with his name on them were published between 2013 and 2015 according to his Wikipedia bibliography, but that doesn't mean he necessarily wrote 20 books in 2 years. Apologies for any misinformation.</p>

<p>Hopefully after that blunder I still have some credibility.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: I’ve now reached out to Vox, Forbes, the New York Times, the Guardian, and CBS News with tips.</p>

<p>Some people were also telling me to reach out to various YouTubers and internet personalities to see if they were interested in tweeting about it or investigating it further, but many of them have their Twitter DMs closed and only have brand emails for emailing about sponsorships and such which are only read by a third party. So if you would like to see them talk about this and you know better ways to contact them, feel free to send it their way.</p>

<p>But for now I’m going to focus less on getting the word out and more on finding new examples of plagiarism within Mark Dawson’s other books.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>EDIT 3: It seems I've found another source of inspiration.</p>

<ul>
<li>“tree allees, expansive lawns, follies, knot gardens, boxwood parterres” [<a href="http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/exterior.html">http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/exterior.html</a>]</li>
<li>“tree allées, expansive lawns, follies, knot gardens, and boxwood parterres” [The Driver by Mark Dawson (62% of sample on Kindle)]</li>
</ul>

<p>If you look up even the shortened form “tree allées, expansive lawns” only the article and The Driver appear. Doesn't seem like a coincidence to me. The website is copyrighted for 2013, while The Driver came out in January 4, 2014, according to Goodreads. Mark does noticeably fix the spelling of allées though, so that’s nice.</p>

<p>EDIT 4: He really likes the Morgan Estate apparently.</p>

<ul>
<li>“A majestic wrought iron gate brought in from a Southern plantation” [<a href="http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/">http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/</a>] (again copyrighted for 2013)</li>
<li>“a majestic wrought-iron gate that looked like it belonged on a Southern plantation” [The Driver by Mark Dawson (60% of sample)]</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT 5:</p>

<ul>
<li>[A quote by Stephen Thomas Erlewine which is available from many sources including the All Music Guide: The Definitive Guide to Popular Music from 2001, page 396; notably, this is also the bio for the band on iHeart] “Suede kick-started the Brit pop revolution of the '90s, bringing English indie pop/rock music away from the swirling layers of shoegazing and dance-pop fusions of Madchester, and reinstating such conventions of British pop as mystique and the three-minute single.”</li>
<li>[The Driver by Mark Dawson, 2014, 69% of sample (nice)] “He liked the swirling layers of shoegazing and dance-pop fusions from the Madchester era and the sharp, clean three-minute singles that had evolved out of it. Suede and Sleeper and Blur.”</li>
</ul>

<p>“Swirling layers of shoegazing and dance-pop fusions” is a pretty generic phrase though, don’t you think? Could definitely just be a coincidence.</p>

<p>EDIT 6:</p>

<ul>
<li>[Page 169 of Mayfair Magazine October 2013] “oak parquetry floor, inlaid with ebony wood, with a gilded fireplace from a palazzo near Florence, Italy, no less.”</li>
<li>[77% of sample of The Driver, published in 2014] “oak parquetry floor inlaid with ebony, a gilded fireplace that belonged in a palazzo as the focal point of the wall”</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT 7:</p>

<ul>
<li>[ <a href="http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/upper.html">http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/upper.html</a> ] (2013) “The upper silk fabric walls that blend with the original wainscoting painted by Dutch painter Van Amstel set the unique intimately warm tone of this office that includes a private powder room and a large wood burning fireplace.”</li>
<li>[79% of sample of The Driver from 2014] “Silk fabric walls blended with painted wainscoting. There was a private powder room and a large wood-burning fireplace.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, it may seem like it’s not plagiarism, but think about the elements of the sentence. The word order is the same: silk fabric walls, then wainscoting, then the powder room, then the fireplace. And the powder room is specifically private, and the fireplace is specifically large and fire-burning, and the walls specifically blend with the wainscoting. Though the sentences look different, the structure and verbiage is pretty much identical. It doesn’t even seem like Mark read this once and recalled it from memory. It seems like he wrote the first quote down word for word, then looked for a way to edit it so it might not show up on an automated plagiarism checker.</p>

<p>There’s also another similarity with I, Sniper and Tarantula. They both contain this phrase: “in a steady two-hand grip, trigger finger indexed above the trigger guard.” Both halves of that phrase seem somewhat commonplace, but the combined phrase is unique to those two.</p>

<p>Also a lot of people were saying “That’s just how snipers operate,” and I agree that technical jargon and actions are going to be described similarly in different works. There aren’t that many ways to say someone shot a gun or slammed a door shut. But the larger context is the similarity of both scenes overall:</p>

<p>In I, Sniper, (1 through 5 are in the span of three paragraphs):</p>

<ol>
<li>The protagonist Bob settles behind his rifle (feels the tension in the trigger, finds the stockweld, slides to the eyepiece, and sees the world through the the mil-dot-rich reticle)</li>
<li>He diddles with the focus ring until it declares the world pristine and hard-edged at five to eight hundred yards</li>
<li>He uses a Leica laser</li>
<li>He pulls out a Kestral 4000 weather station (and notes wind, humidity, and temperature)</li>
<li>He runs the data through his Palm Pilot, dials them into the scope of his rifle, then adjusts for windage</li>
<li>Then a few paragraphs later, he is alone in the world of scope, home in the feel of the rifle, the smell of the cleaning fluid, fiberglass on his cheek, his finger on the trigger</li>
</ol>

<p>In Tarantula, (1 through 5 are in the span of two paragraphs):</p>

<ol>
<li>A character called Tarantula settles behind his rifle (feels the tension in the trigger, finds the stockweld, slides to the eyepiece, stares into it and sees the trees and vegetation through the mil-dot-rich reticle)</li>
<li>He makes a minute adjustment to the focus ring until the last remnant of blur is gone</li>
<li>He uses his handheld laser</li>
<li>He takes out a small weather station (and notes wind, humidity, and temperature)</li>
<li>He notes the data in a small notebook and calculates the solutions and dials those calculations into his rifle, then adjusts for windage</li>
<li>Then a few paragraphs later, he shuts out everything except for the scope, concentrating on the feel of the rifle, the smell of the cleaning fluid, fiberglass on his cheek, and… an aluminum eyepiece against his eye socket? Definitely sounds like something a real gun buff would write...</li>
</ol>

<p>Also he seems to have taken information from a gun website basically verbatim:</p>

<ul>
<li>[ <a href="https://hermannsguns.com.au/dsr-1/">https://hermannsguns.com.au/dsr-1/</a> ] “The folding bipod is mounted onto upper rails (above the barrel), and the adjustable horizontal front grip is mounted on the lower rails (under the barrel). The rifle features fully adjustable buttstock and cheekpiece. […] The barrel is protected by ventilated aluminum handguard and is fitted with muzzle brake (very useful when firing full-power magnum loads).”</li>
<li>[Tarantula, 43% of sample] “The folding bipod was mounted onto upper rails above the barrel and the adjustable horizontal front grip was mounted on the lower rails, under the barrel. The rifle had an adjustable stock and cheekpiece. The barrel was protected by a ventilated aluminium hand guard and was fitted with a muzzle brake, useful when firing full-power magnum loads like this.”</li>
</ul>

<p>I mean, is this what we’re calling research these days? Just dumping an encyclopedia article into your novel with minimal editing?</p>

<p>EDIT 8:</p>

<p>Fixed the part where I said he had sold 6 million books. Someone in the comments said the 6 million figure is for downloads which includes freebies, so the actual sales figure may be a bit different. His latest John Milton book which isn't out yet says "Five Million Copies Sold" on the cover, though that might just be for the John Milton series specifically. His site says, "6 million books downloaded worldwide," not sold. Though his Twitter bio says "over 6m copies sold worldwide," so it could be that his website just hasn't been updated as recently. I'm just going to be safe and say "over 6 million downloads."</p>

<p>Also, somebody noticed that in his newer books, Mark is using a new tactic:</p>

<ul>
<li>[Never Let Me Down Again, 89% sample] "He opened Wikipedia and skimmed the details. It was a small resort on the coast with the locals relying on tourism to help them make their way. It was set on the edge of the Firth of Lorn, the bay reaching out in a horseshoe shape and shielded by the island of Kerrera and, beyond that, the larger Isle of Mull"</li>
<li>[Wikipedia article on Oban] "Oban occupies a setting in the Firth of Lorn. The bay forms a near perfect horseshoe, protected by the island of Kerrera; and beyond Kerrera, the Isle of Mull."</li>
</ul>

<p>All you have to do is have your character read Wikipedia in-universe so that you automatically cite your sources. Pretty good strategy, I must say. (This definitely isn't the most offensive of the evidence, I just found it funny that he just has his characters reading Wikipedia on their phones now.)</p>

<p>EDIT 9:</p>

<p>It looks like Mark Dawson has removed the Kindle version of Tarantula from Amazon, leaving only the Audible version up. He notably also did this with his novel The Black Mile, which some reviews on Amazon and Goodreads have accused of being extremely similar to LA Confidential.</p>

<p>I probably won't be updating this post too much, as I am pretty busy in my personal life, but I encourage people to share the information with newspapers and literary influencers and the like, and I'd also like to point out some common errors I see in articles being written on Substack and Medium:</p>

<ol>
<li>Mark Dawson did not write 20 books in 2 years. (I take full responsibility for this one. Despite correcting this claim in my post, the thumbnail for this post still says it on other platforms, forever reminding me of my mistake. Ugh). Also, generally I'd say don't mention prolificness at all. It makes other prolific authors feel like you're insulting their craft.</li>
<li>Mark Dawson does not run 20BooksTo50K. Michael Anderle started it, and Craig Martelle runs it. Mark Dawson has talked at their Vegas conference as a guest speaker, but that seems to be the extent of his involvement. Generally, don't mention 20BooksTo50K at all other than to say that he's a pretty well-connected, popular author who gets invited to guest speak at conferences. The group has a lot of fans who will defend it, and obviously saying he runs it when he doesn't isn't great for your case.</li>
<li>No conspiracy theories about ChatGPT. He wrote these books 10 years ago.</li>
<li>And obviously, no insulting self-publishing as a whole, or saying that any author who finds success is a sellout. For some reason, I see a lot of people doing this. When you write about a popular self-published author, you're going to attract people who are interested in the self-publishing space. Those people are not going to want to be told that most bestselling self-published books are worthless trash. That should be obvious.</li>
</ol>

<p>So if you'd like to help spread the story, please try not to repeat any of the misinformation listed above. It weakens our case and makes it easy for someone to dismiss an entire article based on a singular factual mistake.</p>

The ugly bastard of a command that combined </span><code>git grep</code><span> with </span><code>find</code><span> and 8 ugly incantations of AWK chained together – locked in there too. The test command I ran yesterday is as reachable as the one command with 12 </span><code>&amp;&amp;</code><span> in it that I ran 3 years ago, all thanks to a long shell history file.</span></p><p><span>Truly: </span><code>~/.zsh_history</code><span> is one of the most important files on my machine. I make use of it tens of times every day, whenever I hit </span><code>Ctrl-r</code><span>. If I wasn’t such a doofus it would contain even more than 26278 commands, because I’ve been keeping a long shell history for nearly a decade. But since I </span><em>am</em><span> such a doofus, I forgot to back it up (or deleted the backup too early) a few times and hence the </span><code>~/.zsh_history</code><span> on the machine I’m typing this only contains 1034 commands.</span></p><p>Someone might say: “well, if the command was that important, why don’t you save it to a script?” And to that I say: look, man, if I knew in advance which command would turn out to be important, then we wouldn’t be here, because I’d already have ascended to the astral realm.</p><p><span>Also: why </span><em>would</em><span> I record it in a script if I can just configure my shell to keep track of all of those commands for me?

It’s a drop-in enhancement of your shell’s history functionality and not only gives you everything I described above – incredibly long shell history and fuzzy-search through it – but also syncing and backup (yup, need that) of shell history across multiple machines, filtering commands by machine, working-directory-specific history and probably 13 other things I forgot. It’s </span><em>very</em><span> nice. Highly recommend it.</span></p><p>Whatever you use: make sure your shell history is recorded, make sure your shell history can grow ridiculously long, and get a fuzzy-search for it.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<h4>Jeff Thompson</h4>

<p>The collision of objects underlies most game experiences and user-interfaces. Baseball bats collide with balls, zombies bump into walls, and Mario lands on platforms and stomps turtles. Even something as simple as clicking a button (a rectangle) with your mouse (a point) is a collision.</p>

<p>This book explains the algorithms behind those collisions using basic shapes like circles, rectangles, and lines so you can implement them into your own projects.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE!</strong> This site has been getting lots of visits which is awesome. I've made some changes so it will look better on mobile devices, make navigation easier, and tried to look over everything for mistakes. If you have any problems or suggestions, please <a href="https://github.com/jeffThompson/CollisionDetection/issues">post an issue on the project repository</a>. Thanks!</p>

<p>Ready to get started? Skip ahead to the <a href="https://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/table_of_contents.php">Table of Contents...</a></p>
<!-- <a href="table_of_contents.php"><p class="nextPage">Skip ahead to the Table of Contents</p></a> -->

<h2>WHAT'S COVERED HERE?</h2>
<p>This book covers collisions between points, circles, rectangles, lines, polygons, and triangles. These examples are meant to be as readable and easily understood as possible. There are definitely faster, more efficient ways to detect these collisions, but this book is intended to be friendly and teach the principles with minimal math.</p>

<p>Each section include a description of the collision algorithm and an interactive example built using <code>processing.js</code>. You can <a href="https://github.com/jeffThompson/CollisionDetection">view the source code for all the examples (and this book!) on GitHub.</a></p>

<p><strong>NOTE!</strong> If you're on a mobile device, the examples might not work super well for you. They are designed for mouse input, so if you're getting frustrated or your finger is in the way, try the site on a computer.</p>

<h2>WHAT'S NOT?</h2>
<p>As with any book, there's a lot more useful material than could be covered here. Things that aren't discussed are mostly left out because the math gets too complicated. Three-dimensional space isn't touched on. Ellipses, which seem like they should be pretty easy, are actually very difficult.</p>

<p>If there's a specific collision not covered that would be helpful, please please <a href="https://github.com/jeffThompson/CollisionDetection/issues"> submit an issue with a request</a> or, better yet, submit a working example that you've built!</p>

<h2>ISSUES?</h2>
<p>If you find code that doesn't run correctly, an algorithm that isn't explained quite right, or a typo, please <a href="https://github.com/jeffThompson/CollisionDetection/issues">report them at this project's GitHub repository</a>. Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>If you’ve used an <code>*nix</code> system, at some point you’ve stumbled upon <a href="http://www.midnight-commander.org/">Midnight Commander</a>, a file manager based on the venerable Norton Commander. You’re probably familiar with the basic operations (<code>F5</code> for copying, <code>F6</code> for moving, <code>F8</code> for deleting, etc.) and how to switch panels (ummm, the <code>Tab</code> key). But <code>mc</code> offers so much more than that. This article aims to show all the useful (YMMV) shortcuts and functionalities that are often overlooked. Most of them can be accessed using the menu (<code>F9</code>), but who has the time to do that?</p>



<p>Before we get started, let’s establish some facts. This article was written and tested on the following software:</p>



<ul><li>Midnight Commander 4.8.13</li><li>GNU bash 4.2.53</li></ul>



<p>Oh, and make sure you’re running a modern and UTF-8 friendly terminal – for example, rxvt-unicode.</p>



<h2 id="hold-your-horses">Hold your horses</h2>



<p>There’s actually one thing I’d recommend doing before you run <code>mc</code>. <code>mc</code> has the ability to exit to its current directory. Meaning, you can navigate the filesystem using <code>mc</code> (sometimes it’s easier than <code>cd</code>ing into that one directory buried deep down <em>somewhere</em>) and when you quit <code>mc</code> (<code>F10</code>), your shell will automagically <code>cd</code> to that directory. This is done thanks to the <code>mc-wrapper</code> script that should be bundled with your installation of <code>mc</code>. The exact location is dependent on your distribution – in mine (Gentoo) it’s <code>/usr/libexec/mc/</code>, in Ubuntu supposedly it’s in <code>/usr/share/mc/bin/</code>. Once found, modify your <code>~/.bashrc</code>:</p>


<div><pre title="">alias mc='. /usr/libexec/mc/mc-wrapper.sh'

</pre></div>


<p>Restart your shell, launch <code>mc</code>, change to another directory, exit and your shell should be set to that new directory.</p>



<h2 id="selecting-files">Selecting files</h2>



<ul><li><code>Insert</code> (<code>Ctrl + t</code> alternatively) – select files (for example, for copying, moving or deleting).</li><li><code>+</code> – select files based on a pattern.</li><li><code>\</code> –<em>un</em>select files based on a pattern.</li><li><code>*</code> – reverse selection. If nothing was selected, all files will get selected.</li></ul>



<h2 id="accessing-the-shell">Accessing the shell</h2>



<ul><li>There’s a shell awaiting your command at the bottom of the screen – just start typing (when no other command dialog is open, of course).</li><li>Since <code>Tab</code> is bound to switching panels (or moving the focus in dialogs), you have to use <code>Esc Tab</code> to use autocompletion. Hit it twice to get all the possible completions (just like in a shell). This works in dialogs too.</li><li>If you want inspect the output of the command, do some input or just prefer a bigger console, no need to quit <code>mc</code>. Just hit <code>Ctrl + o</code> – the effect will be similar to putting <code>mc</code> in the background but with a nice perk. Your current working directory from <code>mc</code> will be passed on to the shell… and vice versa! Hit <code>Ctrl + o</code> again to return to <code>mc</code>.</li><li><code>Ctrl + Enter</code> or <code>Alt + Enter</code> – copy the currently selected file’s name to the shell.</li><li><code>Ctrl + Shift + Enter</code> – same as above, but the full path is copied.</li></ul>



<h2 id="internal-viewer-f3-and-editor-f4">Internal viewer (<code>F3</code>) and editor (<code>F4</code>)</h2>



<ul><li>The internal viewer has many built in modes for “previewing” the content of the file. Try “viewing” a binary, an archive, a DOC document or an image. In some cases, external programs are needed in order for this “previewing” to work.</li><li>If you want to preview the “raw” contents of the file, hit <code>Shift + F3</code>.</li><li>While the internal viewer and editor are powerful, sometimes you want to use your preferred software (<em>cough</em>vim<em>cough</em>). You can do so by setting the <code>PAGER</code> (for viewer) and <code>EDITOR</code> (for editor) variables (for example, in your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file). Then toggle the <code>Options -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Use interal edit/view</code> option (access the top menu by pressing <code>F9</code>).</li></ul>



<h2 id="panels">Panels</h2>



<ul><li><code>Alt + ,</code> – switch <code>mc</code>’s layout from left-right to top-bottom. Mind = blown. Useful for operating on files with long names.</li><li><code>Alt + t</code> – switch the panel’s listing mode in a loop: default, brief, long, user-defined. “long” is especially useful, because it maximises one panel so that it takes full width of the window and longer filenames fit on screen.</li><li><code>Alt + i</code> – synchronize the active panel with the other panel. That is, show the current directory in the other panel.</li><li><code>Ctrl + u</code> – swap panels.</li><li><code>Alt + o</code> – if the currently selected file is a directory, load that directory on the other panel and move the selection to the next file. If the currently selected file is not a directory, load the parent directory on the other panel and moves the selection to the next file. This is useful for quick checking the contents of a list of directories.</li><li><code>Ctrl + PgUp</code> (or just left arrow, if you’ve enabled <code>Lynx-like motion</code>, see later) – move to the parent directory.</li><li><code>Alt + Shift + h</code> – show the directory history. Might be easier to navigate than going back one entry at a time.</li><li><code>Alt + y</code> – move to the previous directory in history.</li><li><code>Alt + u</code> – move to the next directory in history.</li></ul>



<h2 id="searching-files">Searching files</h2>



<ul><li><code>Alt + ?</code> – shows the full Find dialog.</li><li><code>Alt + s</code> or <code>Ctrl + s</code> – quick search mode. Start typing and the selection will move to the first matching file. Press the shortcut again to jump to another match. Use wildcards (<code>*</code>, <code>?</code>) for easier matching.</li></ul>



<h2 id="common-actions">Common actions</h2>



<ul><li><code>Ctrl + Space</code> – calculate the size of the selected directories. Press this shortcut when the selection is on <code>..</code> to calculate the size of all the directories in the current directory.</li><li><code>Ctrl + x s</code> (that is press <code>Ctrl + x</code>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0MK7qz13bU">let it go</a> and then press <code>s</code>) – create a symbolic link (change <code>s</code> to <code>l</code> for a hardlink). I find it very useful and intuitive – the link will, of course, be created in the other panel. You can change it’s destination and name, like with any other file operation.</li><li><code>Ctrl + x c</code> – open the <code>chmod</code> dialog.</li><li><code>Ctrl + x o</code> – open the <code>chown</code> dialog.</li></ul>



<h2 id="virtual-file-system-vfs">Virtual File System (VFS)</h2>



<p><code>mc</code> has a concept known as Virtual File System. Try “entering” an archive (<code>*.tar.gz</code>, <code>*.rpm</code> or even <code>*.jar</code>) – you’ll be able to browse the contents of the archive like a normal folder, without unpacking it first. You extract selected files from the archive by just copying them to the other panel. Bonus points: try “entering” a… <code>*.patch</code> file.</p>



<p>This concept is even more powerful when you realize that remote locations can be viewed the same way. A quick way to browse an FTP location is to just <code>cd</code> to it: <code>cd ftp://mirrors.tera-byte.com/pub/gentoo</code> (first Gentoo FTP mirror I found). You’ll be able to interact with files as you normally do. To exit this remote location, <code>cd</code> to a local directory. Just typing <code>cd</code> will suffice as it will take you to your home directory.</p>



<p>VFS works for SFTP and Samba shares too. Check the manpages for more information on how to specify user/pass, etc.</p>



<h2 id="useful-options">Useful options</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Configuration</strong><ul><li><code>Verbose operation</code> and <code>Compute totals</code> – so that operations like copy/move have a more detailed progress dialogs.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Layout</strong><ul><li><code>Equal split</code> – uncheck to define your own ratio for panels. Maybe you prefer one panel bigger than the other? Useful especially if you keep one of the panels in tree mode (or maybe info/quick view, too).</li><li>Uncheck <code>Hintbar visible</code> – one more line available, one less line of noise.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Panel options</strong><ul><li><code>Show backup files</code> and <code>Show hidden files</code> – I keep both enabled, as I often work with configuration files, etc.</li><li><code>Lynx-like motion</code> – mentioned above, makes left arrow go to parent directory, while the right arrow enters the directory under selection. Faster than <code>Home</code>, <code>Enter</code>, <code>Home</code>, <code>Enter</code>, etc. This options is quite smart, that is if the shell command line is not empty, the arrows work as usual and allow moving the cursor in the command line.</li><li><code>File highlight</code> -&gt; <code>File types</code> is useful, as it uses a different color for example for executable files. <code>Permissions</code>, for me, is not that useful, but I can definitely see it’s use, for example, for sysadmins.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Appearance</strong><ul><li>Only one option here, <code>Skins</code>. You can check out different skins shipped with <code>mc</code> – just select one from the list. I prefer <code>gotar</code>, because it plays well with my <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">solarized</a> terminal colors.</li><li>Useful tip – set up a different skin when logged in as the <code>root</code> user. It’ll be easier to differentiate between root’s and normal user’s session, when you’re swapping between them (as is often the case).</li></ul></li></ul>



<h2 id="bonus-assignments">Bonus assignments</h2>



<ul><li>Define your own listing mode (<code>Right/Left</code> -&gt; <code>Listing mode...</code> -&gt; <code>User defined</code>). Hit <code>F1</code> to see available columns and options.</li><li>Play around in tree mode: <code>Right/Left</code> -&gt; <code>Tree</code> or <code>Command</code> -&gt; <code>Directory tree</code>.</li><li>Compare directories (<code>Ctrl + x d</code>)</li><li>Fill up the directory hotlist (<code>Ctrl + \</code>)</li></ul>



<p>Well, that was a lot to take in. Of course, this list is not complete (that’s what <code>man mc</code> is there for), but I’ve selected the commands and functionalities that are the most useful to <em>me</em>. Embrace the ones you find useful, forget the rest and learn about the other ones I’ve missed!</p>

<p>I was just&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/TitzerBL/status/1743775279485452497">chatting with Ben Titzer on Twitter</a>&nbsp;about control flow in his&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/titzer/virgil">Virgil language</a>&nbsp;(which is cool and you should definitely check out), when I felt the need to&nbsp;<b>once more promote&nbsp;how Common Lisp does non-local control flow</b>&nbsp;(stuff like returning early from a function or breaking from a loop), because I think it's a very nice solution.</p><p>So in Common Lisp we have BLOCK&nbsp;/ RETURN-FROM&nbsp;(which work as a pair) and UNWIND-PROTECT.</p><h3>BLOCK / RETURN-FROM</h3><p><a href="http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/s_block.htm">BLOCK</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/s_ret_fr.htm">RETURN-FROM</a>&nbsp;effectively offer the same functionality as C's&nbsp;<b>setjmp/longjmp</b>&nbsp;-- non-local exits -- but nicely wrapped as we expect it in a lexically-scoped, expression-oriented language.</p><p>BLOCK / RETURN-FROM lets you do:</p><ul><li><b>Early returns</b>&nbsp;from functions or arbitrary code blocks</li><li><b>Breaking</b>&nbsp;from loops, including any number of nested loops</li><li><b>Continuing</b>&nbsp;in loops, including any number of nested loops</li><li>Even&nbsp;<b>arbitrary GOTOs</b>&nbsp;in a code block (with some macrology &amp; trampolining, see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.plover.com/~mjd/misc/hbaker-archive/MetaCircular.html">Baker's TAGBODY</a>)</li></ul><p><b>(block name forms*)</b>&nbsp;lexically binds name within the forms as a non-local exit from which you can return a value with&nbsp;<b>(return-from name value)</b>. Just&nbsp;<b>(return-from name)</b>&nbsp;without a value uses nil as the value.</p><p>A BLOCK without any RETURN-FROM just returns the last value:&nbsp;</p><p><b>(block b 1 2 3)</b>&nbsp;returns 3.</p><p>This prints 1 and returns 2:</p><p><b>(block b (print 1) (return-from b 2) (print 3))</b></p><p>You can have any number of&nbsp;<b>nested blocks</b>:</p><p><b>(block b1 ...

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Reaching the heights of almost $25 Billion dollars, anime is a market that has exploded in the past decade, outputting some of the most stunning stories, animations, and visuals the world has ever seen.</p><p>However, for so much success - for so much fanfare - the anime industry itself is shrouded in a fog; not because it's actually mysterious, but because people just don't particularly care enough to look through the glass.</p><p>This article expands on my <a href="https://youtu.be/BDEIPa9b3OU?ref=hitregbroke.com" rel="noreferrer">documentary piece</a> that explores how anime became an industry that pays its workers $5/day - apathetic workers that don't seem to care about the plight they're in, to a world that's ignorant, whether out of choice or not.</p><p>So - assuming you've watched the video already (or went and watched it, this article will still be here after you're done!) - let's <em>briefly</em> discuss some of the finer points that, for the sake of not overcomplicating an already 30 minute video with an 8 month production span, like </p><p>Questions like, well -</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Well - technically no, if any form of consequence is included A1 definitely did not get off scot free. The sheer amount of news headlines that the suicide made was not something to be scoffed at, even enough to make headlines in the <em>English </em>websphere - which is saying a lot.</p><p>Beyond that A1 did face legal repercussions, though probably not what you're expecting and/or hoping. The family of the deceased managed to get "workers compensation benefits" (whatever that means), and A1 was explicitly implicated in the case, but that's <em>about it</em>.</p><p>At the onset of this implication A1 said the following:</p><blockquote><em>If this decision is true, it is unexpected and we cannot comment because the reason for the judgment is unclear.</em></blockquote><p>which is up there with being one of the most corporate responses to a tragedy they <em>caused</em> as I've ever seen. In fact, I think it's made even worse when you discover this:</p><p>Japan is well known for being one of the harshest countries to work for - the saying goes if you're going to live in Japan, make sure you have a way to make money that's not actually working in the country.</p><p><em>Karoshi</em> (過労死) is officially translatable to "Death by Overwork," something that happened to our unfortunate animator at A1 alongside many others working in manga, anime, and etc. Hearing this, the first thought that probably comes to your head is that, well, <em>"The government should do something about this, right?"</em></p><p>Lucky for you, the government <em>did</em> do something about it. Though the obvious solution to solving the overwork problem (making it <em>illegal</em>) was not deployed; and admittedly would've been pretty much impossible to deploy anyways seeing how much the country seems to work. Instead the government set up a set of guidelines that outlined exactly <strong>what</strong> constituted excessive overwork, or as it's labeled - the "Death by Overwork line"</p><p>While I am not good enough at Japanese to decipher the finer details of <em>Japanese Law</em>, the line in principle is not actually there as an automatic weapon to implicate any companies caught red-handed for working their employees over this line, but more simply there to help establish a causal relationship between overwork and bodily symptoms of disease. Through the use of a satisfactory amount of overtime hours (typically 45-100+) in a certain period (typically 2-3 months) before the development of a disease (like cardiovascular or otherwise) an implication can be made - but nowhere I read actually said that the line can be used to implicate death or <em>suicide</em>. Though to be fair, I probably just missed it since I was reading summaries of the thing on <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%81%8E%E5%8A%B4%E6%AD%BB%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3?ref=hitregbroke.com" rel="noreferrer">wikipedia</a> and not the actual document itself.</p><p>Needless to say though, if death/suicide wasn't included in the original law, there would be enough loopholes that exist that the chain of logic of overwork -&gt; depression -&gt; suicide could be cut before the final act as the law doesn't explicitly state any connection there <em>could </em>be made.</p><p>This would probably explain why even though A1 (and later MADHOUSE) were in gross violation of this <em>Karoshi Line</em>, that none of them actually got any significant consequence from it beside just some headlines and some money they effectively had to throw at the victims' families to make them and the courts get off their back.</p><p>Getting back into <em>my lane</em> and out of the world of a foreign country's politics, this would probably explain the quote of an anime director Daiki Nishimura who said that </p><blockquote><em>"A-1 Pictures&nbsp;is not at fault... the current state of the entire business world that includes&nbsp;A-1 Pictures&nbsp;is at fault. To denounce&nbsp;A-1 Pictures&nbsp;alone is a mistake."</em></blockquote><p>Which, is true. The entire Japanese business world is at fault here for building a system that allows this kind of stuff. But I wonder what part of denouncing A1 pictures is a <em>mistake?</em> This feels like a complicated way of saying "oh but <em>he's doing it too!</em>"<em> </em>Change starts gradually after all.</p><p>And I know that I said I'd stay out of the lawyers hair, but one more twist of irony - the Japanese Labor Laws set in <strong>1947</strong> state that</p><blockquote><a href="https://elaws.e-gov.go.jp/document?lawid=322AC0000000049&amp;ref=hitregbroke.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>Working conditions shall meet the needs of workers to lead a worthy life.</em></a></blockquote><p>Working unpaid overtime (any amount, let alone 100s of hours) doesn't seem like conditions that meets the needs to lead a worthy life do they?</p><p>Anyhow, let's move on. Of course, none of this is legal advice, go consult an actual Japanese lawyer and not some random guy across the Pacific Ocean. And as I said before, this isn't my lane anyways, so let's move our focus from the Japanese parliament to a few (many) blocks down to:</p><p>In any conversation about the topic of working in anime, one of the main problems that comes up is that there simply isn't enough time to produce an anime a week constantly into perpetuity. And so a lot of people, understandably, decide that whoever came up with it must be the villain here. And trace your way back through a few links and you'll find that the godfather of animanga himself - Osamu Tezuka - was the one that came up with this whole upload schedule.</p><p>Though to be fair, Tezuka was no angel either - he was not very nice to work with in Toei (pretty much ignoring management and everyone else's input and concern in favor of his own opinions as a <em>manga artist</em> on how <em>animation</em> should be made), and even in his own studio he was known to slack off and make his employees pick up all his slack just for Tezuka to swing down and take credit for all of it.</p><p>But for all the bad rep the guy gets, is his pushing of anime production to one a week <em>really the catalyst</em> for everything wrong with the industry?</p><p>It didn't take a genius to realize that anime was a powerful export, regardless of whether or not Tezuka pushed the industry to its weekly upload schedule - in fact, this weekly upload schedule might have been the very thing that pushed anime to the heights it's at now. Imagine if suddenly the entire anime industry told us that in order to treat their workers more fairly, they were cutting down to uploading once or twice a month? How do you think the general public would react?</p><p>The issue that stonewalled what could've potentially been a thriving and prosperous industry for higher ups and workers alike may very well have been due to the situation Japan had caught itself in in the years prior and after Tezuka's propping up of Mushi Pro.</p><p>Beyond the fact that unions weren't particularly viable because of a general culture against it that still permeates today, Japanese workers tended to be used to working for very long hours because of an economic situation that the country found itself in the immediate aftermath of WWII</p><figure><img src="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/08/GDP_per_capita_of_Japan_1870_to_1950.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1021" height="646" srcset="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/GDP_per_capita_of_Japan_1870_to_1950.jpg 600w, https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/GDP_per_capita_of_Japan_1870_to_1950.jpg 1000w, https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/08/GDP_per_capita_of_Japan_1870_to_1950.jpg 1021w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>As you can see, Japanese GDP dropped by <strong>nearly half</strong> in the years of and following the WWII. This kind of ginormous economic downturn is, to put it simply, <em>not easy to deal with</em>, <em>for everyone</em> <em>involved</em>.</p><p>In this period of misfortune Japanese companies and Japanese workers seemingly formed an unsaid agreement with each other in terms of employment stability. The workers would work their asses off - and I mean <strong>work their asses off</strong> - in exchange for the company more or less guaranteeing the workers' job security. In this way the company didn't have to worry about losing its workforce, and the workers didn't have to worry about losing their <strong>job</strong>. Sounds like a pretty sweet deal.</p><p>This systematic trade off still somewhat permeates the country today. And with the entire culture revolving around the principle of working hard for your company like it's your family, it's unsurprising that the nascent anime industry also caught some of this principle in its workforce - though after a while, the company end of the bargain seemingly vanished while the workers still kept their half up.</p><p>Why? Well you already know why:</p><p>Outsourcing work isn't some kind of foreign concept to anyone who's thought of scaling anything before, and it's very likely that a lot of smaller scale domestic outsourcing was present in the anime industry before international mass outsourcing anyways.</p><p>And while I mentioned that <em>Mobile Suit Gundam</em> was one of the anime that was marked as a pioneer in this sense, you can be damn sure that a lot of studios were looking to outsource to decrease their labor costs - it just happened that Sunrise had either the capital or network to do so. So in a way, this development was as inevitable as tech companies outsourcing tech support to other countries. </p><p>Though, the dominant wave of hiring people as independent contractors instead of employees didn't actually show up anywhere in my research. Certain sources allege that political developments like the devolution of what was previous government responsibilities to private sector companies during the Junichiro Koizumi cabinet inspired this employment shift away from permanent employees to independent contractors.</p><figure><img src="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/08/Koizumi-Junichiro-2010.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" width="400" height="300"><figcaption><span>Junichiro Koizumi,. former PM of Japan</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, I'm skeptical.</p><p>For one, Junichio Koizumi was elected in <strong>2001</strong>, which was well after outsourcing first became popularized thanks to <em>Mobile Suit Gundam</em> and just a general realization by corporations that if they did that they wouldn't have to pay as much to employees. And as shitty as it sounds, well, if your only sole focus was increasing the bottom line then it's not an illogical plan.</p><p>And does what the government do really set <em>that much precedence</em> for private companies?</p><p>Anyways, the point is beyond me as well since I don't live in Japan, nor do I know anything of its politics (or particularly care to know to be honest). Even if it <em>was </em>true that Koizumi's cabinet influenced this shift, I am not the person to be confidently affirming this claim - leave that to the politicians and historians, or at least someone that lived their life in the country.</p><p>But wait - didn't I mention a political figure in the video? What was his name again...?</p><p>I mentioned in the ending credits that Taro Aso "formed" the Parliamentary League for Manga, Anime, and Games (colloquially and hereafter referred to as <em>MANGA</em>). And while everything said on that slide was true, including Hideaki Anno coming to speak at its inaugural conference, whether or not the former Prime Minister now Finance Minister of the ruling party did it out of any sort of love for <em>MANGA</em> is yet to be determined.</p><p>In fact, it's likely that this was (as expected, to be honest) a maneuver based more on politics and economic reasons alone. </p><p>Japan was already quite aware of the fact that the components of MANGA was amongst one of its strongest cultural soft power exports (and I mean, it's kind of obvious). So why wouldn't the <em>Finance Minister</em> want to prop up the industries that, let's be frank, made Japan famous in the public eye?</p><p>In fact, this movement of exporting cultural soft power, known as <em>Cool Japan,</em> was a movement that was induced by the government to literally do this exact thing all the way back in the 1980s, focused on disseminating Japan's image of "being cool" to the global markets through anime, manga, video games, JPOP, etc, etc, etc. And I think it goes without saying that it definitively worked. On you. On me. On everyone.</p><p>Whether or not this Parliamentary League actually <em>did</em> anything I don't know.</p><p>Cursory searches across the web suggest that they wanted to give tax breaks to people working in anime/manga/etc to help relieve some financial burden and also restart the bungled <a href="https://www.bunka.go.jp/english/about/index.html?ref=hitregbroke.com" rel="noreferrer">International Media Art General Center initiative</a> (I think that's the link?) that was shelved when the LDP (the party Taro Aso belongs to) was defeated. Whether or not any of this actually resulted in relief all the way on the <em>ground </em>is yet to be discovered. For now though, more and more stories keep coming out about overwork, underpay, etc. etc., so it's safe to say that the league's job is not done yet.</p><p>Though, is it even part of the league's job in the first place? Its mission is statement is simply to advance these arts in the national interest of Japan. You have to wonder if the national interest of Japan and the interest of the workers match up - hopefully they do, but there's been plenty of times where the government's goals and the plights of the people actually working don't line up completely.</p><p>Speaking of the people working on anime, what about the people that came up with the story in the first place?</p><p>This portion is going to be short, because at the end of the day manga artists, while the original creators of their stories, don't hold any power over how animators are treated. </p><p>And why would they? They're the creators of the <em>story</em>, not the people who contributed money to the actual production - they're very <em>different </em>things. If some mega rich manga artist successfully contributed his money to an anime's production directly, then he would be given the ownership share accordingly.</p><p>But manga artists don't have <em>time </em>for that. In fact, even with final power over how any creative portion of an anime should look, in the majority of cases it's the publishing company (in Jump's case, <em>Shueisha</em>) that makes decisions on behalf of the manga artist. Why? Well, manga artists have their own things to go tend to. </p><p>Like making manga. Of course, it's the manga artist's choice to dedicate his limited precious free time to going to tend to the anime - and in many cases they do - but it is <em>impossible</em> for them to pay it 100% of their attention all the time.</p><p>And if they <em>do</em> go in with final arbiting power, the people who actually funded the anime want to (if not have their own way) at least an honest discussion about it. But with so many companies funding the thing, just the discussion of it would drag out so long that it's not worth it.</p><p>Better the manga artist stay in his metaphorical lane, and the people producing the anime stay in theirs is the thought. The manga artist has no time, the companies funding the anime would rather not deal with bickering with the manga artist, and the general production system has nary a second to spare for these kinds of things since it's already so time-starved anyways.</p><p>And if the production system is so tight on time all the time - why in the world would anyone come up with the idea of having to double the workload just to get VAs their stuff earlier?</p><p>While I've done research into manga, anime, and how the two link, the third foggy branch of anime by the name of VAs is something I have done <em>no</em> research into. Absolutely none. I had a thought of making a trilogy on the topic, one concerning anime, one concerning manga, and one concerning VAs, all based on how fucked up it is to work in all three but that is a discussion for another time.</p><p>That being said, the doubling of workload to give VAs their portion first is more of a thing in the animators' ballcourt rather than the VAs. In fact, through my research it doesn't seem like the VAs had any influence at all over this seemingly superfluous doubling of workload - this was all just another thing the animating world did and another thing it shot itself in the foot with and the VAs said "Oh, uh... ok?"</p><p>The principle behind this though is, as always, benign. The "two shoot system" as it was called was started to actually draw in animators to work. Because more work means more pay - and everyone wants more pay right? Nevermind the fact that you could just pay your animators fairly, that'd make too much sense.</p><p>As you read this, you've probably thought that there was no <em>way</em> such an ineffective fix could've actually made it through without some other benefit - surely I'm leaving something out?</p><p>Nope. That was it. In exchange for paying animators more (by doubling their workload), episodes would cost 500K yen more to produce, and animators would have to do the workload twice.</p><p>...wtf?</p><p>And speaking of wtf -</p><p>JAniCA, retirement securing organization turned poster boy of anime unionization, was one of the closest ventures towards unionization the entire anime industry had seen in its history.</p><p>Sure there was the Toei union, but as I said in the video, what is a union meant for just Toei animation gonna do for the 99.9% of non-Toei animation folks out there?</p><p>There was also the <em>first</em> EISANRO union that consisted of a lot of movie companies  (assumedly including some animation companies) in the immediate aftermath of World War II, but they only managed to do a handful of things before being shutdown by... the US military? For being too... militant about their unionization efforts? I don't know why the occupying military would be concerned about some random Movie union getting too zealous when that was their idea in the first place but history acts in weird ways I suppose. The <em>second</em> EISANRO union was formed in 1965 and was mainly just for film and television, moving away from animation.</p><p>So with all that being said, how did JAniCA fail? It wasn't one particular company's fault, nor was it forcefully shutdown by a foreign military. In fact, at the time it seemed to the big buzz around as so many influential people seemingly finally came together to put an end to all this shit the anime was going through once and for all.</p><p>While I'm not particularly well versed in JAniCA's history, I can say that as much as JAniCA was an exciting prospect for many animators, for many others it was also the opposite. For reasons that are more tied to general Japanese culture than anything else, unionization has always been a taboo topic in the workplace, especially in anime. Many people don't even want to mention they gave the idea of unionization a thought because it's just not conforming to the social norm, in a country where conforming to social norm is an almost sacred principle.</p><p>However, the will for a union to <em>work</em> is just as important as people wanting to join it in the first place. And while the hype and hubbub about JAniCA was palpable at first (as always with any new happening), continuing that "hype" and actually sustaining it over the long term is an extremely difficult thing to do - especially if your founder <strong>leaves.</strong></p><p>While I never got any definitive answer to what caused Ashida to leave - whether it was infighting, age, or otherwise - I <strong>do</strong> know that he <em>did leave</em>. And regardless of whether or not the departure was adversarial or not, the fact that Ashida departed marked the beginning of the end for JAniCA, with the government it so relied on for support being voted out of power another fundamental happening that dampened JAniCA's future.</p><p>And for the existing members at the time, which, since it was originally a union meant to guarantee member retire benefits, included a lot of experienced (and assumedly influential) figures in anime, those two things were pretty much the last straw. With no leader providing a clear vision and no backing by the government, most of the older folks got jaded towards the situation becoming any better and promptly left.</p><p>Without government backing, without their founder (left and then deceased), figureheads (left and then deceased), and now without many influential members, JAniCA pretty much imploded. This is not to say that JAniCA doesn't still <em>exist</em> - it does, and if any unionization effort was to commence I'd probably give JAniCA to be the breeding ground for it - but that it's out of its prime and way out of the limelight.</p><p>Some sources also said that internally JAniCA was struggling with administrative and legal stuff as articles of incorporation were muddled, but is yet to be definitive.</p><p>Either way, the blaze to change anime burned out with JAniCA. Regardless of whether or not it was the union's fault that it failed, it reinforced the uselessness of unionizing and the hopelessness of the anime situation simultaneously. With so much money flowing to the top of the pyramid, it would have to take another cohort of influential animators to really revive the movement, which brings about the final, and probably most important question:</p><p>Tezuka is second to the Production Committee as the thing that ruined working in anime. And to be fair, it makes sense. They're the ones that are the controllers of the money - what would it hurt them to maybe take a million or two out of their ginormous buckets of profit to make it so animators can <em>eat?</em></p><p>I honestly don't see any real counter argument to that notion, and it seems like anime studios don't either and got markedly tired of it. Bocchi the Rock and Chainsaw Man were two examples of animes that were fully funded by anime studios, and achieved tremendous amounts of success. In this way the anime <em>studio</em> can confidently get all the credit and money from its own creation, and compensate its employees accordingly (hopefully accordingly)</p><p>Does that mean <em>every </em>anime funded by anime studios succeeds like that? No. Not at all. And falling prey to survivorship bias is dangerous when it comes to these cases.</p><p>However, the aforementioned "studio confidently getting all the credit and money for its own creation" is probably the most mind boggling thing for a lot of people (as well as me when I was researching the topic). How could people who worked on things like <em>Demon Slayer</em> not get tremendous amounts of money from such a giant success? </p><p>Well, besides the fact that the Production Committee owns the "stock" that is anime, the more important thing they own (that was not mentioned in the video) is actually the IP <strong>itself</strong></p><p>I'm not sure where this trend came from, and to be honest I'm not sure how it even became a concept. Through tradition, contractual obligation, or something else, most studios sell the rights to the things they create to the Production Committee. This sole action means that the studio does not receive royalties/commissions/<strong>anything else</strong> related to the success of the series. </p><p>This is also combined with the fact that anime studios are often the bottom of the command chain when it actually comes to making anime in its entirety. The Production Committee is the fundraiser and therefore the legal owner, but even TV stations and media conglomerates of the sort have more power than studios as the anime will <strong>never</strong> make the light of the day unless the stations allow it to be aired. </p><p>So with all that said (and much more <em>still</em> unsaid which I plan to cover in a livestream sometime), the ultimate question comes to bear:</p><p>To be completely honest, the video was supposed to originally be just about anime's <em>issues</em>, not about any solution - and that's pretty apparent in the relative size of the sections, with over 80% of the video just detailing anime's issues. But after looking it over and then looking at the YouTube landscape in general, I thought to myself, "Does this platform really need more pure negativity?"</p><p>The answer is no. </p><p>However, even beyond that, coming up with solutions to a problem that Miyazaki nor Satoshi Kon nor Isao Takahata nor any of the other countless numbers of actual influential people in the field could actually solve, is a bit of a tall order. </p><p>Though, this only refers to the <em>practical</em> specifics of a solution to the issue, not theoreticals. In fact, the there are only <strong>two </strong>theoretical paths that anyone could really go down in addressing the issue, the first option being:</p><p>The problem with anime comes down to the fact that people are working <em>too much</em> for <em>too little</em>. And while now we know that Tezuka was the one responsible for setting up this weekly upload norm, who's to say that we can't change it back?</p><p>Even reading that sentence likely made some of us feel uneasy, and that's for a good reason. The weekly and seasonal rotations of anime are almost synonymous with weekly uploads. </p><p><em>That's just how things are</em>.</p><p>And as mentioned before, the general public likely would not like the fact that their weekly anime is now reduced to biweekly, bimonthly, or worse.</p><p>But even beyond that, time is really the smaller of the two problems here. Investment bankers work 100+ hours a week and that's seen as completely fine. What's the difference?</p><p>Investment Bankers' sometimes $100+/hour and $150K+ a year salary is not even in the same league as animators' sometimes &lt;$1 an hour wages. Both are life-changing amounts of money no doubt, but one changes lives for the better, and the other makes people end their own.</p><p>However to be clear, the money problem is not that animators don't make anything, but that it's not <em>enough compensation. </em>In simpler terms, the <strong>pure</strong> fact that animators are making less than $1 a day would not be an issue if the daily cost of living (food, shelter, water, etc) was $0.01. However, the daily cost of living is much more than $0.01 (as you probably already know). </p><p>This is a fact that goes almost without saying - so much so that it's kind of like, well, <em>why am I bringing this up?</em></p><p>Because, the money path splits here accordingly into the two parts of the equation, one being increasing animators pay, the other reducing their expenses, so let's go over</p><p>The first path is to increase animators' pay - and to be brutally honest, this the only <em>real </em>solution of the two paths.</p><p>This is because all the problems in anime pretty much stem from the fact that no one is paid enough. Pay animators $150K+ USD a year and I don't think anyone would bat an eye.</p><p>The problem with this however, is multi-fold. And the first you can probably guess:</p><p>Companies don't like giving up money. Production Committees have operated under these current anime budgets for pretty the entirety of anime's history, and the chance is so low that you'd be able to convince any Production Committee to raise enough money to pay decent wages to every animator there is on a team that the probability of it might as well be negative.</p><p>And to be honest, there may just <em>too many animators</em> out there.</p><figure><img src="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/09/ORAFhaN.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="880" srcset="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/ORAFhaN.png 600w, https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/ORAFhaN.png 1000w, https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/09/ORAFhaN.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>The meme on animators pay that goes around (that is all too true)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What the hell does that mean? Well, it's not like all animators are equal in their positions. Just like the regular corporate world, more senior and skilled artists are put in higher positions that pay more ("more") while more junior and inexperienced artists are the ones that are dealt the whole $5/day bs that is usually the outrage that most people see. And it is coincidentally the fact that those on the bottom of the ladder are the ones that are usually the ones that are outsourced.</p><p>The actual anime production <em>process</em> wasn't actually covered in the video much as the specifics of it aren't particularly important in the grand scheme of the financial system that dictates what makes anime to be made; however, delving into the specifics of <em>paying animators more</em> <strong>does </strong>require at least a cursory knowledge of it, so let's take a brief detour (and I mean <em>really brief</em>)</p><p>To simplify the pipeline for our purposes, all we need to understand is the basic logic that drives the pipeline:</p><ol><li>What the anime looks like must be <strong>made</strong></li><li>The most important <strong>keyframes</strong> have to be drawn</li><li><strong>Every frame in between</strong> the above has to be drawn</li><li><em>Everything must look <u>consistent, correct, and satisfactory</u>.</em></li></ol><p>So let's start from the top, beginning with:</p><p>In every form of visual media, regardless of whether it's a movie, anime, cartoon, etc, etc, the most important part is someone actually <strong>deciding what it should look like</strong>.</p><p>"What it should look like" is much more than just what a character should look like or what colors we should use - in fact, in western media those are the jobs of the character designers, photography directors, color correctors, costume designers, scene compositors, etc, etc, etc. But even despite this, someone still has to <em>put together</em> the whole thing and dictate how all those environments, characters, dialogue, music, etc plays together.</p><p>This is what the director is typically responsible for, and it comes in the form of a <strong>storyboard</strong>:</p><figure><img src="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/09/storyboard-by-makoto-shinkai-vol-6-weathering-with-you-book-21.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="915" srcset="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/storyboard-by-makoto-shinkai-vol-6-weathering-with-you-book-21.jpg 600w, https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/storyboard-by-makoto-shinkai-vol-6-weathering-with-you-book-21.jpg 1000w, https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/09/storyboard-by-makoto-shinkai-vol-6-weathering-with-you-book-21.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Two pages from an almost 500+ page storyboard of </span><i><em>WeatherING With You</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>As you can see, there is a lot going on here - from compositional shots to where light and shadow should fall to camera movements, dialogue, music, and shot time down to the <em>frame</em>, <strong><em>all of this</em></strong> is the job of the director.</p><p>The literal creation of an anime is not an <em>easy job</em>, given to only the senior and most experienced. Accordingly, the directors are compensated fairly.</p><p>Well, not particularly <em>fairly</em> as compared to their western counterparts, but directors aren't usually the people that are struggling to make ends meet. This was the group that JAniCA was originally meant to serve: those people that had been in the industry long enough to the point that they were considering retiring.</p><p>And so while anime directors' pay are very much deficient as compared to the responsibilities they shoulder, the discussion here is not particularly aimed at them. </p><p> It's everybody else:</p><p>After the directors essentially create the anime, in come the people that have to actually execute on that vision - the people who actually have to <strong>draw</strong> the frames.</p><p>The director in the storyboard laid out the keyframes of the anime, but those keyframes are pretty much <strong>never</strong> detailed enough to actually use straight up in the anime. After all, the director doesn't have the time, he has <em>everything else</em> to worry about.</p><p>The storyboard is indeed just the <em>first draft</em>. The process of getting to the second draft involves the delegation of who will do what at what time (typically job of the administrative staff) and the people who have to go in and make the keyframes that were present in the storyboard actually <em>usable.</em></p><p>These "making-keyframes-usable-for-staff" people are referred to as <strong>t</strong>he <strong>LO</strong> and the <strong>Nigen</strong> people, who are responsible for turning storyboard keyframe into a less rough keyframe and then going from less rough keyframe to detailed specific instructions on how everything should look.</p><p>In practice it looks like this - the director's storyboard frames are taken from here:</p><figure><img src="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/09/ys-11-2.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" width="580" height="322"><figcaption><i><em>Your Name</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>To here:</p><figure><img src="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/09/Tokyo_Ghoul_Layout-1.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" width="754" height="424" srcset="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/Tokyo_Ghoul_Layout-1.webp 600w, https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/09/Tokyo_Ghoul_Layout-1.webp 754w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em>LO from Tokyo Ghoul</em></i></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/09/Genga_Example.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" width="755" height="530" srcset="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/Genga_Example.webp 600w, https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/09/Genga_Example.webp 755w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em>(Ni)Genga from Iron Saga</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>Collectively, these two processes are known as <em>Genga</em> (原画). From here, the anime can actually be <em>made</em> - the directions from the nigen on where light, shadow, and color should go (the different colored circles and regions on the second picture) and the more general directions from the layout goes to the people responsible for making the anime <em>look like an anime</em>.</p><p>This invokes the job of the people generally at the bottom portions of the ladder - past the storyboard (絵えコンテ), layout (レイアウト）, genga (原画), and nigen (二原) and into the realm of the <em>douga </em>(動画）.</p><p>Douga people are the most junior people on the staff, and typically the ones that are outsourced. Sure genga, nigen, LO can all be outsourced, but those are typically key positions that <em>need</em> to have quality control or else the entire anime simply falls apart.</p><p>And as for the <em>director</em> - well, as mentioned in the end of the video <em>Satoshi Kon</em>'s movie <em>Dreaming Machine</em> is still incomplete, even though he made the storyboard for it and even part of the Genga. That should be a pretty good idea of how unacceptable outsourcing anime directors is.</p><p><em>Douga</em> though is different. After all, the douga-men are simply following instructions, whether from the LO and nigen "more-refined-drafts" or from the principles of animation that dictate how it should be drawn. This means that the douga-men are the ones that are outsourced en masse to the people who will do it for the lowest pay, and as a result are the ones who are dealt the $5/day treatment.</p><p>But aren't their jobs important too? If the director and genga-men have to get all their stuff perfect, wouldn't a botched execution just ruin it all? And if that's the case, why is this position so neglected?</p><p>Well, as you probably remember, there were not 3, but 4 points in the logic of animation production. Past all the drawings and creation of the anime, there is the extremely important facet of:</p><p>Anime production, as you may remember from the video, isn't a case of each person finishing their job and then just <em>leaving</em>. If that was the case then douga probably wouldn't be outsourced at all - with no one to QC the douga people they would have to necessarily be extremely good at it, and then be compensated better than what they're compensated at time of writing.</p><p>The only issue is that the system <em>isn't</em> like this. And honestly, it wouldn't be possible for a "go home when you're done" system to really work. The only person that knows how they want the anime director to go is the <em>anime director </em>themselves. Same with genga. Same with nigen.</p><p><em>Douga though?</em> Not so much. At the bottom of the chain and the most junior position, douga-men are never going to be expected to get everything perfect. In fact, everyone short of the executive producers and directors themselves is never going to be perfect. Of course, the executives are not perfect either by merit of being human, but their drawings is the <em>reference</em> that everyone else goes off of.</p><p>LO, Nigen, Genga, Douga, whatever terms you throw around that aren't the directors and executives, will have to be checked. The Genga by the director (of genga, LO, or the executive director himself), the douga by the genga, etc., etc.. The rule of thumb here is that if someone is below someone else on the ladder, that someone will be checked. </p><p>And while LO, nigen, and higher up people on the ladder may only be checked once or twice, douga people tend to be checked multiple times.</p><p>By the genga people. </p><p>Who now need to do their own work, check douga mistakes, and correct their own mistakes. </p><p>And because of the fact that douga is outsourced en masse with QC not even close to those of the more experienced people, this means that now the more experienced people need to check douga peoples' work (often very <em>obvious</em> and glaring mistakes) as well do their own work, and their <em>own </em>checked work.</p><p>This compounding chain of responsibility moves up the chain, meaning that now pretty much <em>everyone </em>needs to check <em>everyone else</em>, essentially brute forcing QC by way of repetition until perfection.</p><p>The whole issue of ill-trained douga-men has seen very gradual solutions, as anime studios post guides and documentation on how they want things to be done and how things <em>should </em>be done in terms of following simple animation principles.</p><p>But the issue still stands that there is not enough newbie training. And in the words of a friend who has experience in the pipeline but rather stay anonymous:</p><blockquote><em>All these people get a gig being a [douga] in an anime and they suddenly think they're hot shit, even though what they make is pretty much unusable. But they think they're hot shit, so they're terrible to work with, and their work is terrible, so...</em></blockquote><p>So.... wait, why did we go into this whole "how anime is made thing again?"</p><p>(I talked to this friend afterwards and he said that he was talking about the nigen people... which means that this problem is worse than we thought)</p><p>Japanese animators' pay, as compared to western counterparts, is hilariously deficient. It's almost not comparable.</p><p>However, the problem gets exponentially worse as you move down the chain of command until you reach the <em>douga</em>, which are the most egregious cases.</p><p>The only issue with fixing the most <em>egregious</em> cases is that there will always be someone that would be willing to do it for less. The bottom line is the thing that companies care about after all, and so even if a certain number of outsourced animators decide they want higher pay, companies will simply go to the people who are <em>willing </em>to work for that pay.</p><p>Typically, labor unions and collective action are the solution to this, but outsourcing ruins all of it because there is <em>no way</em> an international union of douga-men can function, making fixing the douga-men issue quite impossible.</p><p>Up the chain, as people get less and less outsource-able, the possibility for collective action grows - though as evident by JAniCA's failure, it's still <em>really really </em>hard.</p><p>So short of asking Production Committees and companies to "please give animators more money because it's the right thing to do" and shareholders and the stock market to "stop expecting infinite growth on a planet with finite resources," it is unbelievably difficult to reconcile the money situation at the bottom portions of the ladder. There was never <em>any </em>labor union directed at douga, and likely never will be until outsourcing is stopped completely.</p><p>So if increasing animators' pay is almost impossible, we must go to the second path:</p><p>While it's the temporary solution of the two, decreasing animators' expenses is by and aways easier to do than paying animators more money because of the current situation of... well, society.</p><p>And to this end I don't really have anything to say since you can come up with any number of ways to decrease expenses - however the most popular way it seems (historically) is to pay for animators' living expenses.</p><p>Whether it was <em>Anime Mirai</em> or another reincarnated version called <a href="https://gogetfunding.com/animator-dorm-2023/?ref=hitregbroke.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>The New Animators' Dormitory Project</em></a>, decreasing living expenses has proved the easiest since you just need to get enough money to pay for a house.</p><p>So if you want to, go ahead and donate to <a href="https://gogetfunding.com/animator-dorm-2023/?ref=hitregbroke.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>The New Animators' Dormitory Project</em></a><em>.</em> They didn't sponsor the video or this article or anything at all (I reached out to them for an interview but they never got back to me after I posted my questions...), but from what I see it's a genuinely good cause, managed by someone who used to be an animator himself.</p><p>Personally I want to eventually find an organization like that too, but based around the concept of direct dispersion of money to animators. But I'm some random college kid in the US who has never worked in anime. So.... yeah that'll probably take a while.</p><p>But if this is the solution (temporary as it may be), why didn't I mention it in the video?</p><p>Beyond the fact that I felt like plugging in a charitable foundation at the end of a video would feel like undisclosed sponsorship and just generally feel weird (even if I did explicitly mention they didn't sponsor the video), the power of the general public <em>knowing</em> about a problem is not to be trifled with.</p><p>Most problems in the world exist because there is not enough will to actually fix them. This goes for everything from climate change to animators being underpaid - whether lack of political will (due to whatever reason) or lack of will of the general public out of pure ignorance or otherwise, a problem needs to have a certain amount of people who <em>want it </em>to be fixed in order for the solution to actually come.</p><p>This is why the time path of the solutions crossroad is probably infeasible - it's not because it's impossible to do (it's as simple as flipping a switch really), but there would be <strong>no support</strong> from<em> </em>pretty much <em>anyone </em>to have anime go from weekly to biweekly or monthly or whatever.</p><p>Giving animators more money - well, there's not enough political will or will from companies to do so; but reducing animators expenses? Well there is a will, the will is just <em>too small</em> to really make a difference across the industry.</p><p>This is the principle reason why I <em>made</em> the video - not to go into the weeds and propose a detailed solution plan to a problem that people by the likes of Miyazaki, Takahata, and Kon were ill equipped to face (let alone <strong>me</strong>) - but to try to take action on the one facet of the solution that I really <em>can </em>make a difference in:</p><p>Letting people know about it.</p><p>Because at the end of the day, letting people <em>know</em> about something is half the battle to creating more public will to fix something. After all, most people don't even know that they don't know what's really happening behind the scenes. And out of the entire population of anime watchers there's a <em>very small </em>subset of them that know <strong><em>enough</em></strong> about the absolute state of anime to the point where they're motivated to act.</p><p>So at the end of the day, that video and this article serve just one purpose - exposing the issue. Only when the issue is exposed to enough people can any progress be made to reconcile this situation, because without pressure from the general public, no company or government or etc will have any incentive to change anything.</p><p>So go out there.</p><p>Tell people about the problem. About the <a href="https://youtu.be/BDEIPa9b3OU?ref=hitregbroke.com" rel="noreferrer">video</a>. About this <a href="https://hitregbroke.com/anime/" rel="noreferrer">article</a>. </p><p>And perhaps your word will spread to someone else, to someone else, to someone else, until enough people are in an uproar about the situation that the pressure forces things to change.</p><p>And <em>you'll</em> be a part of the solution as well.</p><p>(<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tnfn1GEOFNeUihWKRzCS8bfGbv9o5XlW/view?usp=sharing&amp;ref=hitregbroke.com" rel="noreferrer">Bibliography</a>)</p>

<p>What’s the difference between haha and jaja? What about kkkk or hhhh?</p>



<p>It’s a trick question: They mean the same thing. They’re all ways to express laughter, as interpreted by different cultures in different languages.</p>



<p>In person, laughter is universal. No matter what language you speak, almost anyone can understand the meaning of a mischievous giggle, sarcastic snort, or an infectious belly laugh. But it isn’t quite as simple when it comes to writing it down, especially in the era of social media and messaging apps.</p>



<p>Most English speakers are familiar with the nuances of when to say haha, lol, or lmao — each conveying a different weight to laughter. Other languages have their own specific terminology, some of which may not be immediately obvious even when translated.</p>



<p>Take Japanese, for instance. “Warau” is one way to express laughter. Some shortened that to just the first sound of the word, “w.” Others then noticed that “www” looked like blades of grass, leading people to start using the Japanese word for grass (草) to represent laughter. That continual evolution is why, if you want to write about laughing hard in Japanese, you could type 大草原: “giant grass field.”</p>



<p>Or there’s “askfhsjkd,” used in Turkish. No acronyms or wordplay here —&nbsp;keyboard spam is actually a popular way to indicate amusement among young Turkish speakers, as if they’ve been overcome by laughter and are unable to type complete words.</p>



<p>These are just a small fraction of the many ways people around the world represent laughter, from a little Nepali giggle — khit khit — to an explosion of laughter in Nigerian Pidgin: lwkmd, or “laugh wan kill me die.”&nbsp;We know the world can always use a little more laughter, so we’ve rounded up dozens of our favorite examples of how people from all over laugh online.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Kelsey Coolahan’s obsession began during her third year at Cooper Medical School, part of Rowan University in New Jersey.</p>
<p>“I’m in the labor and delivery room, and I’m witnessing this whole miracle-of-birth thing, it’s amazing,” Coolahan remembered. “And then you have one lonely resident at the foot of the bed who is slowly pulling something out of mom’s uterus … he pulls it out, does a quick inspection, then slaps it on the table and turn back towards mom. But I didn’t turn my back. What is this thing?”</p>
<p>That thing was the placenta.</p>
<p>“It’s like an alien meat cake. A purple alien meat cake. It looks like it should be pulsating because it looks like it landed here from another planet,” Coolahan said.</p>
<p>If you picture a baby in the womb, it’s sitting in a thin sac filled with amniotic fluid. The sac is made by the baby — one part of it thickens and basically attaches to the womb. That thicker part is the placenta.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, the placenta whose delivery Coolahan observed needed some further inspection in the pathology lab. Most people would have followed the baby, but she decided to follow the placenta. That’s where she met Julieta Barroeta, who specializes in gynecological pathology at Cooper University Hospital.</p>
<p>“That’s where I started to realize the placenta was even more interesting than it looked,” Coolahan said. “First, it’s the only temporary organ. Second, it’s the baby’s lung, it’s a waste-disposal system, and it’s a nutrition source.”</p>
<p>For the placenta to do all that amazing stuff, it has to do something no other tissue can do.</p>
<p>“The placenta is essentially a fascinating organ because it allows for two human beings that are genetically very different. Because half of the fetus is maternal, but the other half is paternal, and yet the pregnancy can go on for nine months without the mom’s body destroying it,” Barroeta said.&nbsp; “And that, from an immune standpoint, is fascinating, because if you were to receive a piece of someone else and insert that under your skin, that would not last there for three days, your body will actively reject it.”</p>
<p>So the placenta has to be the most incredible gatekeeper. It has to let oxygen and nutrients get to the baby, and it has to let carbon dioxide and waste get out. For example, medicines can get through, protective antibodies can get through. But if the mother and baby ever actually touched, or if any blood got through, the mother’s immune system would immediately kill the baby.</p>
<p>Coolahan kept researching. She stumbled across a paper by Ed Chuong, who researches molecular cellular developmental biology at Biofrontiers Institute in Colorado. According to Chuong, “The placenta we think of as a defining characteristic of live-bearing mammals … primates, rodents, dogs, cats, etc.,” is estimated to have evolved about 150 million to 200 million years ago. Before that, if you wanted to reproduce, you had to lay eggs.</p>
<p>So before placentas, a baby had to be in an eggshell. Literally walled off. “All the nutrients baby needed had to already be in the egg from the get-go,” said Coolahan. “If you think about a chicken egg — that’s exactly what the yolk is, it’s a care package that has to last the embryo till it’s born.”</p>
<p>Chuong added, “the evolution of placenta essentially involved losing that eggshell and instead replacing that with some sort of tissue or organ that attaches to the mother’s uterus during development.”</p>
<p>But losing that shell presents some challenges. “It’s important that the maternal and fetal blood streams remain separate,” Chuong said. “And so the separation of these bloodstreams is established through this cell layer called the syncytiotrophoblast.”</p>
<p>The syncytiotrophoblast is the outermost layer of the placenta, the part that is pressed against the uterus. It’s literally a layer of cells that have fused together, forming a wall.</p>
<p>“This is where the magic happens,” Coolahan said. “This wall of cells keeps mom and baby working in harmony and not killing each other. There’s no other structure like this anywhere else in the body.”</p>
<p>When evolutionary biologists like Chuong mapped the genomes of these cells, they found that the protein that allowed these cells to fuse into a wall, called syncytin, didn’t look like it came from human DNA. It looked more like HIV. According to Chuong, this protein actually came from an ancient retrovirus, the most famous of which is HIV.</p>
<p>Viruses are little strips of biologic information that can’t do anything on their own. So they enter cells and hijack the cell’s machinery to make copies of themselves and replicate and move on to infect other cells. Retroviruses take it to the next level because they are strips of DNA that enter cells and just go ahead and insert themselves into the host’s own DNA. Now, the host is stuck with viral DNA for the rest of its life, and it can never stop doing what the virus wants.</p>
<p>Viruses such as HIV have been infecting vertebrates for probably a couple hundred million years, according to Chuong. So, according to evolutionary biologists, once upon a time some retrovirus infected an egg-laying vertebrate. And by chance, that virus settled into that animal’s egg cells. And it just so happened that that particular infected egg met a nice sperm and got fertilized. The baby that was hatched — whatever kind of protomammal it was —&nbsp;now had copies of that virus’ DNA in all its cells.</p>
<p>This virus didn’t kill the baby —&nbsp;if it had, we wouldn’t be sitting here as humans telling this story. What it did was give this offspring a premium feature.</p>
<p>“We got an upgrade,” Coolahan said. “Viruses fuse with things in order to infect them. Now, we get this viral DNA that lets us make a protein that fuses things.”</p>
<p>Once a viral protein, the virus essentially morphed or evolved into what we now know as syncytin. This protein gives baby the ability to fuse cells into a wall&nbsp; — the placenta —&nbsp;that connects mom and baby but also keeps them separate.</p>
<p>“This virus helped that mammalian ancestor survive better by giving it a better placenta, then this piece of DNA would have been passed on to the [next] generation and eventually spread into the population,” Chuong said. “And this process we think of as a molecular domestication of an ancient retrovirus element. And this retroviral element continues to be important for placental development in modern humans.”</p>
<p>It’s worth noting this probably didn’t happen overnight. This was the key step, but it probably took many more generations worth of mutations. But it’s more than placentas … biologists have found huge chunks of our DNA that are actually remnants of ancient viral infections.</p>
<p>Looks like we’ve been domesticating viruses for a long time. Or have viruses been domesticating us? Either way, what all that DNA is doing for us is, for the most part, still a mystery.</p>
<p>“It just seems like in a way we’re part virus, otherwise we’d be laying eggs,” Coolahan said.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I BOW TO few in my admiration for the anthropologist, economist, radical leader, and delightful prose stylist David Graeber, who died unexpectedly in 2020 at the age of 59. Since I read his little book <em>Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology </em>in 2004, I’ve been telling anyone who seemed inclined to listen that he was the most important anarchist thinker since Peter Kropotkin, who died in 1921. His ideas, including those beautifully captured in his book <em>Debt: The First 5,000 Years</em> (2011), helped motivate and shape the Occupy movement, which took inspiration from his commitments to radical democracy, egalitarianism, and “prefigurative politics”—the idea that people seeking to make a revolution should try to live and organize now in a way they’d want to arrange their lives together in the future.</p><p>

Graeber studied at the University of Chicago under Marshall Sahlins and did his anthropological fieldwork in Madagascar in the early 1990s. When he returned, he published the still-neglected <em>Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of Our Own Dreams</em> (2001), a work of high theory whose ambitions constituted a throwback to the eras of Marcel Mauss or Claude Lévi-Strauss, though its positions were strikingly fresh. On the strength of his early work, he got a job at Yale and at the same time became active in the “anti-globalization” movement (Graeber hated that term), with its demonstrations and actions against such organizations as the World Bank and the World Trade Organization. When he didn’t get tenure at Yale, he believed it was because of his politics.</p><p>

By <a href="https://publicanthropologist.cmi.no/2017/10/11/academic-politics-of-silencing/#david-graeber">his own account</a>&nbsp;politically unemployable in American academia, he claimed that, though the academy of that era sheltered myriad “authoritarian Marxists,” anarchism was considered beyond the pale, as I can confirm from personal experience. But with his remarkable energy and productivity, he landed on his feet in London, eventually scoring a richly deserved professorship at the London School of Economics. <em>Debt</em> continued his work at the juncture of anthropology and economics that had begun with <em>Theory of Value</em>. The two disciplines overlap, after all, in being concerned with the nature of exchange, the origin of money, and in describing structures of inequality, among other matters. The book had a remarkable reception; never before has an anarchist been enthusiastically blurbed by the editor of the classic capitalist organ <em>Financial Times</em>.</p><p>

Indeed, that book, and a lot of the best Graeber, has an “undeniable” quality: even if you write for <em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em>, it turns out, you are very unlikely to think the same things about money, debt, and value after you read it as before. You may well start to think you are seeing these matters clearly and nonideologically for the first time, as Graeber traverses the world’s cultures and history to see how forms of money and forms of peonage emerge. He shows that there have been many alternative possibilities for systems of exchange and value—Mauss’s “gift economies,” for example. All of this in loose yet precise and swashbuckling prose, and all of it well documented by a serious scholar. <em>Debt</em>, the book, had for many a dramatic “head-flipping” quality, and it helped make sense of what Occupy, emerging at that moment, was saying and what it wanted.</p><p>

The book yielded insights into many things but was compelling above all in giving a real history of economic hierarchy and domination, culminating in the structural and ideological predicaments of neoliberal capitalism, as each consumer blamed herself for undertaking the debt she carried throughout her life, and as the whole human world became, as though by an invisible hand, a completely unaccountable vertical power structure. People came to Occupy, for one thing, because they realized suddenly that the burden of debt they were lugging around was a structural strategy centuries in the making, not an individual failing.</p><p>¤</p><p>
The anarchism that Graeber developed across a series of protest actions and writings (including, eventually, 2007’s <em>Possibilities: Essays on Hierarchy, Rebellion, and Desire</em>, 2009’s<em> Direct Action: An Ethnography</em>, and 2013’s <em>The Democracy Project: A History, a Crisis, a Movement</em>, for example) was—is—notably contemporary and inspiring. Central aspects of Graeber’s politics as he framed them circa 2000–15 include “the rejection of the state and of all forms of structural violence, inequality, or domination”; “decentralized forms of consensus-based direct democracy,” as developed in Occupy encampments but also in many other places and cultures; “prefigurative politics of resistance” or the claim that a nonauthoritarian revolution cannot be conducted successfully by authoritarian forms of organization; “rejection of permanent, named leadership structures”; and anti-statist “communism,” economies based around sharing or even “the gift,” as suggested by the anthropology of Mauss, for example.</p><p>¤</p><p>
It has taken a little while and repeated readings for it to sink in, but I think that Graeber was reaching the point of rejecting, or at least severely (if implicitly) qualifying, almost all of these positions by late in his authorship. Particularly in <em>On Kings </em>(2017), his collaboration with his mentor Sahlins, and <em>The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity </em>(2021), co-written with the archeologist David Wengrow and completed just a couple of weeks before his death, Graeber’s politics grew more “mainstream” in a number of respects, even as his narrative of the origins of political authority and economic hierarchy remained fresh, radical, and richly documented, and even as his prose style retained all its charm. But perhaps LSE professorships, FSG book contracts, and the approval of the <em>Financial Times</em> have moderating or even co-opting effects after all.</p><p>

In <em>Dawn of Everything</em>, Graeber and Wengrow argue that neither inequality nor the state has any particular origin, indeed that “equality” and “the state” are not sensible or singular concepts at all. As issues in political philosophy, questions about the alleged origins of the state and of economic inequality arose in the Enlightenment of the 18th century, historians say, primarily because of the challenges presented by greater contact with diverse cultures in the era of colonialism. But these questions rested, Graeber and Wengrow argue, on a set of historically contingent, tendentious, and simplistic readings of human history by figures such as Rousseau and Turgot. Both “inequality” and “the state,” on Graeber’s late view (or on <em>late Graeber</em>’s view), are problematic and ideological concepts, not adequately defined, perhaps not definable. Hence, egalitarianism and anti-statism, insisting that these things ought to be destroyed, are equally simplistic and equally trapped in Western conceptualizations that emerged in modernity.</p><p>

It is not clear, to me at any rate, that one can be an anarchist and not also be an egalitarian and an anti-statist. Repudiating those two positions, by which Graeber definitely defined his politics circa 2010, amounts to repudiating the anarchist position, or else leaves you trying to define it in other terms, terms more adequate to the subtlety and complexity of power as it actually appears in real cultures. If he intended to generate such a reconstrual, he hadn’t quite done that work yet when his writing abruptly stopped.</p><p>

One wonders what Occupy-era Graeber, the man who (by <a href="https://davidgraeber.org/about-david-graeber/">his own account</a> and many others’) helped formulate the slogan “We Are the 99%,” might make of passages like the one below. Its placement near the beginning of <em>Dawn of Everything</em> indicates that it amounts to the book’s fundamental frame:</p><p>[I]t’s not clear what eliminating inequality would even mean. (Which kind of inequality? Wealth? Opportunity? Exactly how equal would people have to be in order for us to be able to say we’ve “eliminated inequality”?) The term ‘inequality’ is a way of framing social problems appropriate to an age of technocratic reformers, who assume from the outset that no real vision of social transformation is even on the table.</p>
<p>Debating inequality allows one to tinker with numbers, argue about Gini coefficients and thresholds of dysfunction, readjust tax regimes or social welfare mechanisms, even shock the public with figures showing just how bad things have become (“Can you imagine? The richest 1 percent of the world’s population own 44 percent of the world’s wealth!”)</p><p>
Here, he appears almost to be ridiculing himself and the Occupy movement (if also Thomas Piketty), or Graeber and Wengrow appear to be ridiculing earlier Graeber. Do I hear a touch of Friedrich Hayek? What was once a fundamental critique of the world economic hierarchy, insisting that it has created an absurd and ever-increasing degree of differential access to resources, has become “technocratic tinkering,” and it is not exactly clear why. That some questions about inequality are obscure or ill-framed does not indicate that inequality of wealth is not a fundamental social problem. To make sure you don’t miss the centrality of this stunning turnabout, Graeber and Wengrow return to their critique of egalitarianism in their conclusion, and also to their critique of the concept of the state. Of the concept, mind you, not the thing.</p><p>¤</p><p>
Late Graeber, in <em>On Kings</em> and <em>Dawn of Everything</em>, asserts again and again, in the words of the title of a long chapter, that “the state has no origin.”&nbsp;“Social scientists and political philosophers have been debating the ‘origins of the state’ for well over a century,” observe Graeber and Wengrow. “These debates are never resolved and are unlikely ever to be. […] Much like the search for the ‘origins of inequality,’ seeking the origins of the state is little more than chasing a phantasm.”</p><p>

This assertion builds on a complex analysis of social power emerging from anthropological and archeological research. Rejecting the classic Weberian definition of the state as a group of people who claim a monopoly on violence, Graeber and Wengrow argue that the modern state contingently combines three elements that are seen in history in very different configurations: control of violence, control of information, and individual charisma. Reducing political power ultimately only to the first of these paradigmatic forms of domination is, they repeat, terribly simplistic.</p><p>

“It seems to me that ‘the state’ is itself becoming something of a shopworn concept,” Graeber writes in <em>On Kings</em>. Debates about its origins, he continues,</p><p>almost always assume that “the state” is just one thing, and that in speaking of the origins of the state one is necessarily also speaking of the origins of urbanization, written literature, law, exploitation, bureaucracy, science, and almost anything else of enduring importance that happened between the dawn of agriculture and the Renaissance, aside, perhaps, from the rise of world religions.</p><p>
This is a mistake, he says, because “‘[t]he state’ would better be seen as an amalgam of heterogeneous elements often of entirely separate origins that happened to have come together in certain times and places, and now appear to be in the process of drifting apart.”</p><p>

But this “simplistic” conception of the state is also the conception that fuels or articulates the anarchist critique of the state, from William Godwin to Mikhail Bakunin to Emma Goldman. As I argue in my book <em>Against the State: An Introduction to Anarchist Political Theory</em> (2008), state power rests on violence and coercion; violence and coercion, to be defensible, require a moral justification; social contract theory and all other attempts in this regard are pathetically inadequate. Therefore, there should be no political state. In late Graeber, this looks simplistic and nonempirical. “The state” is a concept that falls apart under analysis and should be abandoned. Of course, that makes anti-statism just as senseless, for what is an anti-statist fighting against, really?</p><p>

“It is possible to have monarchs, aristocracies, slavery and extreme forms of patriarchal domination, even without a state,” write Graeber and Wengrow, somewhat puzzlingly, and “it’s equally possible to maintain complex irrigation systems, or develop science and abstract philosophy without a state.” So, “what do we actually learn about human history by establishing that one political entity is what we would like to describe as a ‘state’ and another isn’t? Are there not more interesting and important questions we could be asking?”</p><p>

Well, certainly there are other questions. But this one takes Graeber well beyond—or well before—his previous anarchism.</p><p>¤</p><p>
A fundamental line of argument in <em>Dawn of Everything</em> suggests, specifically, that Graeber was developing toward something like liberalism by the end of his authorship. This will of course please some and annoy others. I am in the latter camp, but I want to acknowledge that liberal political philosophy might find an interesting new set of justifications and also interesting new versions and formulations in late Graeber. In any case, Graeber and Wengrow centrally argue that concepts such as individual rights and democratic decision-making procedures, so central to Enlightenment political thought, in fact originated in an “indigenous critique” by colonized peoples of the political arrangements of European powers. They make this vivid with the figure of Kandiaronk (died 1701), a Wendat orator, probably from what is now Michigan, whose challenges to Western political systems may well have been (“may well have been” and “almost certainly” appear frequently in this book) influential on Diderot and Voltaire.</p><p>

This is a way of rehabilitating the concept of universal inherent individual rights and freedoms from the familiar claim that it is a Eurocentric artifact of colonial exploitation and the Marxist critique that individualist liberalism represents the official ideology of the bourgeoisie. Graeber and Wengrow suggest that such concepts in fact embody an attack on colonial exploitation and rising capitalism, made by the very people being exploited or destroyed.</p><p>

On this basis, the authors issue something like a universal declaration of human rights, rather different from the United Nations version, but related to it as well. They enumerate three basic liberties: namely, “the freedom to move, the freedom to disobey and the freedom to create or transform social relations.” They seem to hold that these rights belong to every individual in any culture. In a bewildering yet ultimately suggestive passage in their conclusion, Graeber and Wengrow write:</p><p>[O]ur own intellectual traditions oblige us to use what is, in effect, imperial language […] and the language already implies an explanation, even a justification, for much of what we are really trying to account for here. That is why, in the course of this book, we sometimes felt the need to develop our own, more neutral (dare we say scientific?) list of baseline human freedoms and forms of domination.</p><p>
I don’t think this is in keeping even with the vast panoply of political and economic arrangements that the authors themselves have just surveyed, but I agree that the book makes use of an “imperial” vocabulary, delineating the putatively objective, irresistible political truths that all rational persons will arrive at in the end. As to the idea that the freedoms and forms of domination that Graeber and Wengrow delineate are “scientific”: Rousseau and Turgot said the same, but I wouldn’t have thought that I’d hear the claim from Graeber, especially as there is no consideration in the book of other contenders for fundamental freedoms and no attempt to give foundational justifications for these specific freedoms, or even to sort them out in relation to one another.</p><p>

It’s not that I think we should routinely violate one another’s freedom to disobey, though that is going to require some elucidation. It’s that I’m somewhat surprised to see this sort of universalism emerging from this sort of anthropology, which supports it thinly at best and is widely and wildly in tension with it at worst. Graeber was never a relativist, exactly, but casually applying the same three concepts to every culture that has ever existed seems incompatible with his previous vast respect for human differences, not to mention many of his own earlier political positions. The persistent “threeness” of the distinctions hints at a line of a priori reasoning that is anything but empirical.</p><p>¤</p><p>
If I had to take a crack at characterizing late Graeber’s politics, I might say that he seemed to be becoming a mainline leftist or state socialist. In an excellent <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/11/david-graeber-dawn-of-everything.html">profile</a> of the author in <em>New York</em> magazine, Molly Fischer writes that, at the end of his life, Graeber was active in the UK Labour Party. “The reason I support [Jeremy] Corbyn, or am happy about him,” he said in an interview, “is because he is willing to work with social movements.” Graeber, reports Fischer, “had struck up a connection with John McDonnell, Corbyn’s shadow chancellor of the exchequer [in] an effort to bring ordinary Britons into the workings of government.” Corbyn’s communications director described Graeber as someone “sparking the imagination for what’s politically possible.” Responding to the charges of antisemitism that, in part, led to the end of Corbyn’s leadership, Graeber&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/DoubleDownNews/status/1433398863864401923">recorded a video</a>&nbsp;in his defense. I think that is pretty far from where he was in 2000.</p><p>

Perhaps Graeber’s political positions “matured”; most of ours do, really, if we persist long enough. Or perhaps the empirical data drew him in different directions, or his collaborators affected his expressions of his positions. Still, I wish we’d had a couple more books to see where this was going, and a couple of chances to hear Graeber’s own interpretation of his development in relation to his previous ideals. As it is, I’m left a bit disheartened.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<p>This is <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/index.html">Words and Buttons Online</a> — a collection of&nbsp;interactive <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/all_tutorials.html">#tutorials</a>, <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/all_demos.html">#demos</a><a>, and </a><a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/all_quizzes.html">#quizzes</a> about <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/all_mathematics.html">#mathematics</a>, <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/all_algorithms.html">#algorithms</a> and <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/all_programming.html">#programming</a>.</p>
	
	<p>
A lot of programmers claim they know C. Well, it has the most famous syntax, it has been there for <span id="c_years_old">44</span> years, and it’s not cluttered with obscure features. It’s easy!
	</p>
	
	<p>
I mean, it’s easy to <em>claim</em> that you know C. You probably learned it in college or on the go, you probably had some experience with it, you probably think that you know it through and through because there’s not much to know. Well, there is. C is not that simple.
	</p>
	<p>
If you think it is — take this test. It only has 5 questions. Every question is basically the same: what the return value would be? And each question has a choice of four answers, of which one and only one is right.
	</p>

	<h2>
1
	</h2>
	<pre>struct S {
  int i;
  char c;
} s;

int main(void) {
  return sizeof(*(&amp;s));
}
	</pre>
	

	<h2>
2
	</h2>
	<pre>int main(void) {
  char a = 0;
  short int b = 0;
  return sizeof(b) == sizeof(a+b);
}
	</pre>
	

	<h2>
3
	</h2>
	<pre>int main(void) {
  char a = ' ' * 13;
  return a;
}
	</pre>
	

	<h2>
4
	</h2>
	<pre>int main(void) {
  int i = 16;
  return (((((i &gt;= i) &lt;&lt; i) &gt;&gt; i) &lt;= i));
}
	</pre>
	

	<h2>
5
	</h2>
	<pre>int main(void) {
  int i = 0;
  return i++ + ++i;
}
	</pre>
	
	<p>
That's it.

<b>Instructions</b>
</p>
<p>
Choose a position from the drop-down box.  Your goal
is to place your opponent in checkmate.
If the text says "White mates in X," you are playing as White.
If the text says "Black mates in X," you are playing as Black.
</p>
<p>
If you make a mistake that allows your opponent
to escape checkmate, the status will change to "Incorrect."
Click "Reset position" to try again.
When you have found the solution, the status will say "Checkmate!"
You can then select another position for more practice.
</p>
<p>
If you get stuck on a problem, click "Show hint" to see which piece you should move.
If you still cannot figure out the solution, click "Show solution."
The computer will then switch sides with you and play the solution against you.
(The sides remain switched like this until you select a new position.)
</p>
<p>
To speed up moving through the positions, the buttons labeled &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;

<p>The National Security Archives recently published a&nbsp;<a href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb538-Cold-War-Nuclear-Target-List-Declassified-First-Ever/">declassified list</a> of U.S. nuclear targets&nbsp;from 1956, which spanned 1,100 locations across Eastern Europe, Russia, China, and North Korea. The map below shows all 1,100 nuclear targets from that list, and we’ve partnered with NukeMap to demonstrate how catastrophic a nuclear exchange between the United States and Russia could be. If you click detonate from any of the dots, you can see how large an area would be destroyed by the bomb of your choice, as well as how many people could be killed.</p>
<div>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>How to use the nukemap:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on one of the dots on the map;</li>
<li>Press detonate;</li>
<li>Select what yield (explosive power) you would like to use;</li>
<li>Press the red detonate button.</li>
</ol>

<p><br>Even though today’s nuclear targets list is classified, it probably doesn’t look dramatically different. The United States still has about <a href="https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/">1,900 nuclear warheads deployed</a> on missiles and bombers (with thousands more on reserve), ready to be launched at a moment’s notice and able to hit their targets within 30 minutes. This unstable situation is extremely risky and has repeatedly come close to <a href="https://futureoflife.org/background/nuclear-close-calls-a-timeline/">triggering nuclear war by accident</a>. Moreover, many of today’s hydrogen&nbsp;bombs are&nbsp;hundreds of times more powerful&nbsp;than the two atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. If a nuclear war were to break out today, <a href="https://futureoflife.org/background/the-risk-of-nuclear-weapons/">nuclear winter</a> might&nbsp;kill most people on Earth.</p>
<p>This leads to an important question: Just how many nuclear weapons do we actually need? Seven&nbsp;of the nine&nbsp;nuclear&nbsp;nations&nbsp;have determined that deterrence requires fewer&nbsp;than 300 nuclear weapons, and none of them have been attacked. Yet, not only do the United States and Russia each have approximately 7,000 nuclear warheads — accounting for 90% of the world’s arsenal – both countries are currently escalating the situation, making&nbsp;massive investments to enhance their&nbsp;arsenals with more accurate and lethal&nbsp;nuclear weapons. Many military analysts agree that the U.S. and Russia could easily meet their&nbsp;deterrence needs with much fewer nuclear weapons. Even the Pentagon has stated that the U.S. needs no more than 1,000 nukes to deter a nuclear attack. But don’t take their word for it:&nbsp;play with the map yourself and see just how destructive nuclear weapons can be!</p>
<h2>1100 Nuclear Targets, Radioactive Fallout, and Weather</h2>
<p>While the maps above show a general radius of nuclear destruction, weather patterns would play a role in how many people would be affected by nuclear fallout. Given that weather can change day to day, if we drop a nuclear bomb near a border in one country on the wrong day, innocent people in a neighboring country could also suffer the effects of radioactive fallout. How far and in which direction the radioactive materials travel would depend on the size of the bomb and the local weather. In the following graphics, Alex Wellerstein simulates two terrifying possibilities (<em>We recommend viewing the following slideshows in the full-screen option to more easily see where the radioactive material will travel.</em>):</p>
<h3>1) What would have happened if all 1,100 nuclear targets were struck by a nuclear weapon of a given size on April 29, 2016?</h3>
<p>In this slideshow, the bombs grow larger, and the nuclear fallout spreads farther from the target in a direction that’s dictated by the local weather patterns. Note that this slideshow doesn’t yet show the effect of nuclear winter: if enough smoke from nuclear fires rises high into the stratosphere, it can spread across our planet and trigger a decade-long mini-ice-age and farming collapse, potentially killing most of Earth’s 7 billion people.<br></p>
<h3>2) How would the direction of radioactive fallout change if the bombs were dropped on three different days?</h3>
<p>In this case, we use weather data from April 29, April 30 and May 1 of 2016 to see how the direction of nuclear fallout changes if 100 kt bombs were dropped on the 1,100 nuclear targets (typical bombs today are many times more powerful). Different weather patterns would send nuclear fallout in different directions on each day. Pay close attention to countries like Germany, Denmark and Finland, which could get hit with radioactive fallout if the nuclear targets were struck on the wrong day.<br></p>
