	    <p>Nov 17, 2025 • by <a href="https://rebble.io/team#person-Team%20Rebble">Team Rebble</a></p>
        
        <p>This is a post that we don’t take any joy in writing.  When we <a href="https://rebble.io/2025/10/09/rebbles-in-a-world-with-core.html">wrote last month about our agreement with Core Devices</a>, we went into it believing that cooperation between Core and Rebble would be the best decision for the Pebble community.  Core would spearhead the development of brand new watches, and we’d be there to provide our Rebble Web Services to go with them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our agreement is already breaking down.  We hoped that by putting on a kind face, and publishing an optimistic-sounding blog post along with Eric, that we’d be able to collaborate in a way that met <a href="https://rebble.io/2025/10/09/rebbles-in-a-world-with-core.html#Our-promise-to-you">our responsibilities to you, our users</a>.  We knew that neither of us would be able to get all we wanted, but we thought we had enough common ground that we could serve Pebble users together.</p>

<p>Rebble has been working since the beginning to keep the Pebble experience alive – maintaining the App Store, building new services like <a href="https://rebble.io/2025/03/24/introducing-bobby-our-new-pebble-assistant.html">Bobby</a>, and running <a href="https://help.rebble.io/">frontline support</a> for people keeping their Pebbles ticking the whole time.  (The Pebble App Store that Core offers <em>right now</em> is backed by Rebble!)  But Eric and Core recently demanded that, instead of working together, we need to just give them all of our work from the last decade so that they could do whatever they want with it.  And in Eric’s latest newsletter, he hasn’t told you the truth about where the work that makes his business run came from.  <strong>We’d rather have cooperated with them to build something great together, but we’ve reached an impasse. So now, we’re asking you – our community – what to do with Core.</strong></p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="how-we-got-here">How we got here</h2>

<p>Nine years ago, Eric Migicovsky’s company, Pebble Technology Corporation, went out of business and dropped support for the hundreds of thousands of Pebble smartwatches out there.  Rebble – and our community! – put together <a href="https://rebble.io/2018/02/15/rebble-web-services.html">a Herculean effort</a> to salvage the data that was left on the Pebble app store.</p>

<p>Since then, we built a replacement app store API that was compatible with the old app store front end.  We built a storage backend for it, and then we spent enormous effort to import the data that we salvaged.  We’ve built a totally new dev portal, where y’all submitted brand new apps that never existed while Pebble was around.  So far, we’ve spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on storing and hosting the data.  And the humans who run the Rebble servers have also spent incredibly late nights upgrading Kubernetes clusters, responding to outages, and generally keeping things ticking.</p>

<p><strong>What you now know as the Pebble App Store from Eric’s new company, Core Devices, is the result of nearly a decade of our work.</strong>  The data behind the Pebble App Store is 100% Rebble.  And the App Store that we’ve built together is much more than it was when Pebble stopped existing.  We’ve patched hundreds of apps with Timeline and weather endpoint updates.  We’ve curated removal requests from people who wanted to unpublish their apps.  And it has new versions of old apps, and brand new apps from the two hackathons we’ve run!</p>

<p>We’ve been negotiating with Eric for months now.  We’ll compromise on almost everything else, but our one red line is this:</p>

<p><strong>Whatever we agree on, there has to be a future for Rebble in there</strong>.</p>

<p>We want to give Core’s users access to the Rebble App Store. (We thought we agreed on that last month.)  We’re happy to commit to maintaining the Web Services.  We’d be happy to let them contribute and build new features.  And what we want in return is simple: if we give Core access to our data, we want to make sure they’re not just going to build a walled garden app store around our hard work.</p>

<p>The problem is, Core won’t commit to this.  Core wants unrestricted access to do whatever they want with the data that we archived and have spent the last years curating, maintaining servers for, and keeping relevant.  If we gave Core the rights to use the App Store data however they want, they could build their own Core-private App Store, replace Rebble, and keep any new changes proprietary – leaving the community with nothing.</p>

<p>We’ve asked Eric about this every time we talk.  He has occasionally said verbally that that isn’t their plan…  but when it comes time to put it in writing, <strong>he has repeatedly refused to guarantee that</strong>.  A week ago, we asked him to chat about this one more time – he delayed our conversation, and <strong>then in the intervening time, scraped our app store, in violation of the agreement that we reached with him previously.</strong></p>

<h2 id="whats-in-an-agreement">What’s in an agreement?</h2>

<p>We’re sad that the Rebble community has had tension with Core Devices ever since Google released the original PebbleOS source code.  We’ve been pretty quiet about it for a while – we thought that we had a chance of working together if we tried hard not to fracture the community.  But by now, a verbal promise isn’t enough.</p>

<p>When the code was released in January, we immediately branched the repository and started maintaining PebbleOS.  The Rebble community <a href="https://github.com/pebble-dev/pebble-firmware/commit/a7b074559b806df674c2a61ae16ec188ffa96ce3">began porting an open-source Bluetooth stack to PebbleOS</a>, to support classic Pebble devices.  Eric <a href="https://archive.ph/64i0V#pebbleos-firmware-pl">mentions this in his blog post</a>, but what he doesn’t say is that <strong>Rebble paid for the work</strong> that he took as a base for his commercial watches!</p>

<p>Shortly after, Core <a href="https://discord.com/channels/221364737269694464/256091649996881922/1374320093613527151">forked PebbleOS</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> away from public maintainership. Back in June, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/221364737269694464/256091649996881922/1386743333669306409">they said that they would merge back periodically</a><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>; it’s now November, and we’re yet to see anything get merged back.  <a href="https://discord.com/channels/221364737269694464/256091649996881922/1386334214202331228">Multiple efforts to contribute to PebbleOS were put on hold</a><sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> while we waited for Core to merge upstream.  It never happened.  Eric, in his blog post, now says that he will <a href="https://archive.ph/64i0V#pebbleos-firmware-pl">run PebbleOS as a “benevolent dictatorship”</a>.</p>

<p>Rebble’s work is the backbone of Core in other ways.  The Core Devices app is based on <code>libpebble3</code>; in Eric’s blog post, <a href="https://archive.ph/64i0V#pebble-mobile-app">he said that Core built it</a>.  The reality is that it started life as <code>libpebblecommon</code>, which Rebblers wrote as part of our mobile app project (<a href="https://github.com/pebble-dev/mobile-app">Cobble</a>), and we funded through the <a href="https://rebble.io/2020/09/04/rebble-grants.html">Rebble Grants program</a>.  The work that we did together saved Core a month or two of engineering effort at the beginning; Core took Rebble’s work, added to it, and then paid us back by <a href="https://github.com/coredevices/libpebble3/commit/35853d45cd0ec51cb732be866f6f72467653a613">putting a more restrictive license on their contributions</a> and wrapping a closed-source UI around it.</p>

<p>A few months ago, Core promised that they would let Rebble maintain and own <a href="https://developer.rebble.io/">the developer site</a>, after Rebblers spent days making it build again, importing new content, etc.  Then, in Eric’s original proposed agreement, he demanded not only that Core publish the developer site on their domain, but that we <em>remove our copy of the developer site and redirect to theirs</em>.</p>

<p>These have been blows to our community, to be sure.  We’ve tried not to let this affect our negotiations: we want to work together.  But we went into this wary, knowing what a promise from Core meant.</p>

<p>The last straw was two weeks ago.  We’d already agreed to give Core a license to our database to build a recommendation engine on.  Then, Eric said that he instead demanded that we give them all of the data that we’ve curated, unrestricted, for him to do whatever he’d like with.  We asked to have a conversation last week; he said that was busy and could meet the following week.  Instead, <strong>the same day, our logs show that he went and scraped our servers</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="whats-at-stake">What’s at stake?</h2>

<p>Rebble’s goal is to have a community-driven place to develop for these watches that we all love – today, and also in the future, if (love forbid!) <a href="https://financialpost.com/technology/personal-tech/fitbit-inc-buys-pebble-software-calls-time-on-smartwatch-pioneer">something were to happen</a> to Core Devices.</p>

<p>If we gave Eric an unrestricted license to our data, he could do the same thing he did to our firmware work, and our mobile app work.  He’d have the right to take it and build his own app store – and the work that we’ve done together as a community for the past decade would no longer be in our control.</p>

<p>We watched this happen ten years ago when Pebble went under (Rebble has been around longer than Pebble and Core combined by now!).  We don’t know that Core can commit to supporting this ecosystem in the long term.  After all, the warranty on Pebble 2 Duo is 30 days long, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/1oudn9a/it_unfortunately_happen/">early users are already reporting that</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/1ohxizn/got_my_pebble_core_2_duo_today_and_the_bottom/">their buttons are falling apart</a>!</p>

<p>But even if Eric has the best intentions now and can find the funds to keep Core afloat, you could imagine that OpenAI, or someone else, would want to acquire Core and make him an offer he couldn’t refuse.  We’ve watched this play out <a href="https://www.slashgear.com/north-bought-by-google-shuts-down-focals-1-0-and-2-0-smart-glasses-30627021/">so many times</a>, from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614883/humane-ai-hp-acquisition-pin-shutdown">so many other companies</a>, in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/23/spotify-to-shut-off-car-thing-for-good-leading-users-to-demand-refunds/">the decade since</a> – a product we love gets released, and <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/16233096?hl=en">then gets killed off</a>, another victim of closed-source enshittification for profit.  We love these watches, and we’d be sad if that happened.  And more to the point, we love this community that we’ve been a hub for.</p>

<h2 id="this-is-your-choice">This is your choice</h2>

<p>In our last post, we said that Rebble belongs to you.  We mean it.  These are the apps that you’ve written and contributed to your fellow Pebblers.  These are the watches that you spent so long caring about and loving.  This is your community, where you make awesome happen.  So we see two directions from here, and <strong>we need the community’s help to decide</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If y’all would like, one option is that we could <strong>aggressively protect the work we’ve done</strong>, and try to protect the community going forward.  If Eric had the foresight to back up this data nine years ago and maintain it himself, there’s nothing we could say about this.  But he didn’t, and we, together, did.  We made it absolutely clear to Eric that scraping for commercial purposes was not an authorized use of the Rebble Web Services.</p>

    <p>This gets ugly in a hurry, but we have legal resources that can protect us.  We’d rather spend our time on building a next-generation open source mobile app than spend it on a fight, but if it’s what we have to do, we’re not afraid.  If we want to keep what we built, we’re going to have to use our energy to protect it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other option is that we could <strong>just let Eric do whatever he wants</strong>.  Eric believes that our database should be free for anyone to make their own copy of, because we are a non-profit Foundation.  We don’t agree, but maybe you do!  Nothing has to live forever, and we’ve done great work together.  If the community prefers that we pass the mantle onwards, we’ll do what y’all think is right.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These are both painful options for us.  And to be clear, we’d rather do neither!  <strong>If Eric and Core are willing to give us a legal commitment that they’re not just going to kick us out, and that they’ll work with us, we’d much rather do that</strong>.  We’re happy to let them build whatever they want as long as it doesn’t hurt Rebble. Eric, you’re the best in the world at making quirky hardware for people who genuinely love what they wear.  We’re great at building a community.  Use our locker, use our timeline, use our App Store – we’ve built it just for you.  Just as long as we can work together as partners.</p>

<p>But in the mean time, we’re here at a crossroads.</p>

<h2 id="we-need-you">We need you</h2>

<p>For our friends who have supported us over the past years: we’re sorry that you’re caught in the middle of this.  We think Rebble can be the hub of community, and Core can make awesome products, and these don’t have to be in conflict.  Eric’s new devices, Pebble 2 Duo and Pebble Time 2, look absolutely amazing!  We want to support him in making beautiful hardware long into the future – without exposing our users to the classic walled garden enshittification trap.</p>

<p><strong>But we want your input.</strong>  If Eric and Core can’t play nice, <strong>we need you, our community, to tell us what to do</strong>.   We’re serious: if you think we should do something different, we will.  So we’re posting this on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/1ozzsr9/an_update_on_rebbles_attempted_collaboration_with/">Reddit /r/pebble</a> and a handful of other places.  We’ll be (gulp!) reading the comments – the top rated <em>and</em> the long tail – to try to understand what the community’s sentiment is.  We’ll be watching the discussion on Discord.  And, of course, if you want, you can <a href="mailto:board@rebble.foundation">e-mail the Rebble Foundation Board of Directors directly</a>.  We’d like to hear from you.</p>

<p>Yours in hope –
so many of us from the Rebble team over the past 9 years, including:
David, Joshua, Will, Ruby, Stasia (LCP), Siân (astosia), Harrison (Link Sky), Lavender, Ben, Ephraim (gibbiemonster), Jakob (Jackie)</p>

    <p>I asked Google Gemini a pretty basic developer question. The answer was unremarkable, apart from it mentioning in conclusion that it knows I previously used a tool called Alembic:</p>
<img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/unbuffered-stream/alembic1-1.webp">
<p>Cool, it's starting to remember things about me. Let's confirm:</p>
<img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/unbuffered-stream/alembic2.webp">
<p>Ok, maybe not yet.</p>
<p>However, clicking "Show thinking" for the above response is absolutely wild:</p>
<img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/unbuffered-stream/alembic3.webp">
<p>I know about the “Personal Context” feature now — it’s great. But why is Gemini instructed not to divulge its existence? And why does it decide to lie to cover up violating its privacy policies? I’m starting to believe that “maximally truth-seeking” might indeed be the right north star for AI.</p>

            <p>Microsoft is moving forward with its plans to turn Windows 11 into a full-fledged “AI” operating system amidst <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/11/16/after-windows-11-ai-os-backlash-microsoft-tells-angry-power-users-we-care-deeply-about-you/">Copilot backlash</a>.</p>
<p>The first big move in that direction is an experimental feature called “Agent Workspace,” which gives AI agents access to the most-used folders in your directory, such as Desktop, Music, Pictures, and Videos. It will also allow AI agents to have their own runtime, desktop, user account, and ability to always run in the background if you turn on the feature.</p>
<h2>New agentic features in Windows 11</h2>
<p>As soon as I installed Windows 11 Build 26220.7262, Windows Latest noticed a new toggle “Experimental agentic features” inside the “AI Components” page in the Settings app &gt; System.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Experimental-agentic-features-in-Windows-11.jpg" alt="Experimental agentic features in Windows 11" width="1089" height="760" srcset="https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Experimental-agentic-features-in-Windows-11.jpg 1089w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Experimental-agentic-features-in-Windows-11-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Experimental-agentic-features-in-Windows-11-1024x715.jpg 1024w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Experimental-agentic-features-in-Windows-11-768x536.jpg 768w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Experimental-agentic-features-in-Windows-11-696x486.jpg 696w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Experimental-agentic-features-in-Windows-11-1068x745.jpg 1068w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Experimental-agentic-features-in-Windows-11-602x420.jpg 602w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Experimental-agentic-features-in-Windows-11-100x70.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1089px) 100vw, 1089px"></p>
<p>This turns on “Agent Workspace,” but it doesn’t work right now, and if you’re wondering, it’s only available to Windows Insiders in the Dev or Beta Channel.</p>
<h3>What are AI Agents and how do they work?</h3>
<p>Before I explain what an Agent Workplace is, you need to understand AI Agents. If you’ve ever used ChatGPT, you might have come across ‘Agents.’ AI Agents have their own interface, and they navigate just like a human.</p>
<p>For example, if you ask ChatGPT’s Agent to book a travel, it’ll open Chromium on Linux in an Azure container, search the query, visit different websites, navigate each page and book a flight ticket using your saved credentials. An AI Agent tries to mimic a human, and it can perform tasks on your behalf while you sit back and relax.</p>
<p>That’s the core idea Silicon Valley is trying to sell.</p>
<p>Up until now, these Agents have been limited to cloud containers with Chromium and Linux terminal access, but as Microsoft wants Windows 11 to become an “AI-native” OS, it’s adding Agent Workspace.</p>
<p>Agent workspace is a separate, contained Windows session made just for AI agents, where they get their own account, desktop, and permissions so they can click, type, open apps, and work on your files in the background while you keep using your normal desktop.</p>
<p>Instead of letting an agent act directly as you, Windows spins up this extra workspace, gives it limited access (like specific folders such as Documents or Desktop), and keeps its actions isolated and auditable.</p>
<p>Each agent can have its own workspace and access rules, so what one agent can see or do doesn’t automatically apply to others, and you stay in control of what they’re allowed to touch.</p>
<p>I find the idea of Agent Workspace a bit similar to <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/10/27/how-i-installed-microsoft-store-in-windows-sandbox-with-powershell-script/">Windows Sandbox</a>, but it’s not designed with security or privacy in mind, and it could be one of the ways to have fun with AI on Windows 11.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Windows-11-Agent-Workspace.jpg" alt="Windows 11 Agent Workspace" width="1075" height="648" srcset="https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Windows-11-Agent-Workspace.jpg 1075w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Windows-11-Agent-Workspace-300x181.jpg 300w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Windows-11-Agent-Workspace-1024x617.jpg 1024w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Windows-11-Agent-Workspace-768x463.jpg 768w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Windows-11-Agent-Workspace-696x420.jpg 696w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Windows-11-Agent-Workspace-1068x644.jpg 1068w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Windows-11-Agent-Workspace-697x420.jpg 697w" sizes="(max-width: 1075px) 100vw, 1075px"></p>
<p>When you toggle on the feature, Windows warns that it could hurt performance and affect your security or privacy controls, but it’ll give you access to new “agentic” experiences in the OS.</p>
<h3>Windows 11 lets AI agents into your Documents and Desktop folders</h3>
<p>When you turn on the feature, you’re giving agents access to apps and even local folders, such as Desktop, Music, Pictures, and Videos.</p>
<p>Agent Workspace requires access to apps or private folders to perform actions on your behalf. Microsoft insists that it’s taking care of security implications by giving Agent Workspace its own authorisation (a separate account, similar to your user account), runtime isolation. Each agent will have its own defined set of dos and don’ts.</p>
<p>The idea is to give Agents their own backyard on your PC, and let them run in the background all the time. You’ll be able to monitor the logs and keep an eye on agent activity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Experimental-agentic-features-toggle.jpg" alt="Experimental agentic features toggle" width="1092" height="647" srcset="https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Experimental-agentic-features-toggle.jpg 1092w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Experimental-agentic-features-toggle-300x178.jpg 300w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Experimental-agentic-features-toggle-1024x607.jpg 1024w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Experimental-agentic-features-toggle-768x455.jpg 768w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Experimental-agentic-features-toggle-696x412.jpg 696w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Experimental-agentic-features-toggle-1068x633.jpg 1068w, https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Experimental-agentic-features-toggle-709x420.jpg 709w" sizes="(max-width: 1092px) 100vw, 1092px"></p>
<p>While each agent gets its own account, independent of your personal account, an agent would&nbsp;<em>still</em> need access to your personal folders, such as Documents and Desktop. You’ll be asked to grant permissions to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>apps in Windows</li>
<li>personal folders, mostly downloads, documents, and desktop, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>AI Agents may have performance issues</h3>
<p>In our tests, Windows Latest observed that the experimental toggle warns of potential performance issues, and it makes sense.</p>
<p>AI agents are going to run in the background all the time and use RAM or CPU, depending agent’s activity. However, Microsoft’s early benchmarks suggest they won’t really drain PCs of their power. Microsoft says AI Agents will use a limited amount of RAM and CPU, but it won’t tell us how limited the ‘limit’ is.</p>
<p>By default, these agents are lightweight, but the catch is that some Agents could be resource-intensive.</p>
<h2>Microsoft insists it deeply cares about power users</h2>
<p>Ironically, this new agentic experience has been announced after <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/11/16/after-windows-11-ai-os-backlash-microsoft-tells-angry-power-users-we-care-deeply-about-you/">Microsoft’s Windows boss promised to improve Windows for everyone</a>, including developers, whom it deeply cares about.</p>
<p>While the Experimental Agents Feature is optional, it makes it quite obvious Microsoft will not stop investing in AI for Windows 11, and Agentic OS is the future, whether you like it or not.</p>

the Ruby team at Shopify and other contributors have done to improve Ruby’s
runtime performance.</p>

<h2>Counting Method and Block Calls</h2>
<p>To find hot spots, YJIT counts how many times your program calls each function
or block. When this count reaches a certain threshold, YJIT stops your program
and converts that section of code into machine language. Later Ruby will execute
the machine language version instead of the original YARV instructions.</p>
<p>To keep track of these counts, YJIT saves an internal counter nearby the YARV
instruction sequence for each function or block.</p>
<p><img width="40%" src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2025/11/17/Figure-4-5.svg"><br>
<span>
Figure 4-5: YJIT saves information adjacent to each set of YARV instructions
</span>
</p>
<p>Figure 4-5 shows the YARV instruction sequence the main Ruby compiler created
for the <span>sum += i</span> block at (3) in Listing 4-1. At the
top, above the YARV instructions, Figure 4-5 shows two YJIT related values:
<span>jit_entry</span> and <span>jit_entry_calls</span>. As we’ll see in a moment, <span>jit_entry</span> starts as a null value but will later hold a
pointer to the machine language instructions YJIT produces for this Ruby block.
Below <span>jit_entry</span>, Figure 4-5 also shows <span>jit_entry_calls</span>, YJIT’s internal counter.</p>
<p>Each time the program in Listing 4-1 calls this block, YJIT increments the value
of <span>jit_entry_calls</span>. Since the range at (1) in Listing
4-1 spans from 1 through 40, this counter will start at zero and increase by 1
each time <span>Range#each</span> calls the block at (3).</p>
<p>When the <span>jit_entry_calls</span> reaches a particular
threshold, YJIT will compile the YARV instructions into machine language. By
default for small Ruby programs YJIT in Ruby 3.5 uses a threshold of 30. Larger
programs, like Ruby on Rails web applications, will use a larger threshold value
of 120. (You can also change the threshold by passing <span>—yjit-call-threshold</span> when you run your Ruby program.)</p>
<h2>YJIT Blocks</h2>
<p>While compiling your Ruby program, YJIT saves the machine language instructions
it creates into <em>YJIT blocks</em>. YJIT blocks, which are distinct from Ruby blocks,
each contain a sequence of machine language instructions for a range of
corresponding YARV instructions. By grouping YARV instructions and compiling
each group into a YJIT block, YJIT can produce more optimized code that is
tailored to your program’s behavior and avoid compiling code that your program
doesn’t need.</p>
<p>As we’ll see next, a single YJIT block doesn’t correspond to a Ruby function or
block. YJIT blocks instead represent smaller sections of code: individual YARV
instructions or a small range of YARV instructions. Each Ruby function or block
typically consists of several YJIT blocks.</p>
<p>Let’s see how this works for our example. After the program in Listing 4-1
executes the Ruby block at (3) 29 times, YJIT will increment the <span>jit_entry_calls</span> counter again, just before Ruby runs the
block for the 30th time. Since <span>jit_entry_calls</span> reaches
the threshold value of 30, YJIT triggers the compilation process.</p>
<p>YJIT compiles the first YARV instruction <span>getlocal_WC_1</span>
and saves machine language instructions that perform the same work as <span>getlocal_WC_1</span> into a new YJIT block:</p>
<p><img width="75%" src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2025/11/17/Figure-4-6.svg"><br>
<span>
Figure 4-6: Creating a YJIT block
</span>
</p>
<p>On the left side, Figure 4-6 shows the YARV instructions for the <span>sum += i</span> Ruby block. On the right, Figure 4-6 shows the new
YJIT block corresponding to <span>getlocal_WC_1</span>.</p>
<p>Next, the YJIT compiler continues and compiles the second YARV instruction from
the left side of Figure 4-7: <span>getlocal_WC_0</span> at index 2.</p>
<p><img width="75%" src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2025/11/17/Figure-4-7.svg"><br>
<span>
Figure 4-7: Appending to a YJIT block
</span>
</p>
<p>On the left side, Figure 4-7 shows the same YARV instructions for the <span>sum += i</span> Ruby block that we saw above in Figure 4-6. But now
the two dotted arrows indicate that the YJIT block on the right contains the
machine language instructions equivalent to both <span>getlocal_WC_1</span> and <span>getlocal_WC_0</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look inside this new block. YJIT compiles or translates the Ruby
YARV instructions into machine language instructions. In this example, running
on my Mac laptop, YJIT writes the following machine language instructions into
this new block:</p>
<p><img width="75%" src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2025/11/17/Figure-4-8.svg"><br>
<span>
Figure 4-8: The contents of one YJIT block
</span>
</p>
<p>Figure 4-8 shows a closer view of the new YJIT block that appeared on the right
side of Figures 4-6 and 4-7. Inside the block, Figure 4-8 shows the assembly
language acronyms corresponding to the ARM64 machine language instructions that
YJIT generated for the two YARV instructions shown on the left. The YARV
instructions on the left are: <span>getlocal_WC_1</span>, which
loads a value from a local variable located in the previous stack frame and
saves it on the YARV stack, and <span>getlocal_WC_0</span>, which
loads a local variable from the current stack from and also saves it on the YARV
stack. The machine language instructions on the right side of Figure 4-8 perform
the same task, loading these values into registers on my M1 microprocessor:
<span>x1</span> and <span>x9</span>. If you’re curious
and would like to learn more about what the machine language instructions mean
and how they work, the section “Adding Two Integers Using Machine Language”
discusses the instructions for this example in more detail.</p>
<h2>YJIT Branch Stubs</h2>
<p>Next, YJIT continues down the sequence of YARV instructions and compiles the
<span>opt_plus</span> YARV instruction at index 4 in Figures 4-6
and 4-7. But this time, YJIT runs into a problem: It doesn’t know the type of
the addition arguments. That is, will <span>opt_plus</span> add two
integers? Or two strings, floating point numbers, or some other types?</p>
<p>Machine language is very specific. To add two 64-bit integers on an M1
microprocessor, YJIT could use the <span>adds</span> assembly
language instruction. But adding two floating pointer numbers would require
different instructions. And, of course, adding or concatenating two strings is
an entirely different operation altogether.</p>
<p>In order for YJIT to know which machine language instructions to save into the
YJIT block for <span>opt_plus</span>, YJIT needs to know exactly
what type of values the Ruby program might ever add at (3) in Listing 4-1. You
and I can tell by reading Listing 4-1 that the Ruby code is adding integers. We
know right away that the <span>sum += 1</span> block at (3) is
always adding one integer to another. But YJIT doesn’t know this.</p>
<p>YJIT uses a clever trick to solve this problem. Instead of analyzing the entire
program ahead of time to determine all of the possible types of values the <span>opt_plus</span> YARV instruction might ever need to add, YJIT
simply waits until the block runs and observes which types the program actually
passes in.</p>
<p>YJIT uses <em>branch stubs</em> to achieve this wait-and-see compile behavior, as shown
in Figure 4-9.</p>
<p><img width="75%" src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2025/11/17/Figure-4-9.svg"><br>
<span>
Figure 4-9: A YJIT block, branch and stub
</span>
</p>
<p>Figure 4-9 shows the YARV instructions on the left, and the YJIT block for
indexes 0000-0002 on the right. But note the bottom right corner of Figure 4-7,
which shows an arrow pointing down from the block to a box labeled stub. This
arrow represents a YJIT branch. Since this new branch doesn’t point to a block
yet, YJIT sets up the branch to point to a branch stub instead.</p>

Apart from the idea of showing enemies in a consistent colour, I like the choice of projections. Instead of opting for the classic projections seen in Western cartography, the authors of these maps choose projections that better balance the shape and size of different countries. They take advantage of the fact that only one region of the globe needs to be represented.</p><p>The encyclopaedia also includes maps of all the oceans, which also incorporate ocean current

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	   
<p><img alt="DDoS" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2025/06/12/DDoS-outage-map-globe.jpg" width="1600"></p>


<p>Microsoft said today that the Aisuru botnet hit its Azure network with a 15.72 terabits per second (Tbps) DDoS attack, launched from over 500,000 IP addresses.</p>


<p>The attack used extremely high-rate UDP floods that targeted a specific public IP address in Australia, reaching nearly 3.64 billion packets per second (bpps).</p>


<p>"The attack originated from Aisuru botnet. Aisuru is a Turbo Mirai-class IoT botnet that frequently causes record-breaking DDoS attacks by exploiting compromised home routers and cameras, mainly in residential ISPs in the United States and other countries," <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azureinfrastructureblog/defending-the-cloud-azure-neutralized-a-record-breaking-15-tbps-ddos-attack/4470422" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> Azure Security senior product marketing manager Sean Whalen.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wiz.io/lp/inside-mcp-security-a-research-guide-on-emerging-risks?utm_source=bleepingcomputer&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_campaign=FY26Q2_INB_FORM_MCP-Security-Research-Guide-Emerging-Risks&amp;sfcid=701Py00000PcNI9IAN&amp;utm_term=FY26Q4-bleepingcomputer-970x250&amp;utm_content=MCP-Security-Guide" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/c/w/wiz/MCP-Research-Guide-970x250.png" alt="Wiz"></a>
</p>


<p>"These sudden UDP bursts had minimal source spoofing and used random source ports, which helped simplify traceback and facilitated provider enforcement."</p>


<p>Cloudflare <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cloudflare-mitigates-new-record-breaking-222-tbps-ddos-attack/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">linked the same botnet</a> to a record-breaking 22.2 terabits per second (Tbps) DDoS attack that reached 10.6 billion packets per second (Bpps) and was mitigated in September 2025. This attack lasted only 40 seconds but was roughly equivalent to streaming one million 4K videos simultaneously.</p>


<p>One week earlier, the XLab research division of Chinese cybersecurity company Qi'anxin attributed another 11.5 Tbps DDoS attack to the <a href="https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/super-large-scale-botnet-aisuru-en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Aisuru botnet</a>, saying that it was controlling around 300,000 bots at the time.</p>


<p>The botnet targets security vulnerabilities in IP cameras, DVRs/NVRs, Realtek chips, and routers from T-Mobile, Zyxel, D-Link, and Linksys. As XLab researchers said, it suddenly ballooned in size in April 2025 after its operators breached a TotoLink router firmware update server and infected approximately 100,000 devices.</p>


<p>Infosec journalist Brian Krebs <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/cloudflare-scrubs-aisuru-botnet-from-top-domains-list/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> earlier this month that Cloudflare removed multiple domains linked to the Aisuru botnet from its public "Top Domains" rankings of the most frequently requested websites (based on DNS query volume) after they began overtaking legitimate sites, such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.</p>


<p>The company stated that Aisuru's operators were deliberately flooding Cloudflare's DNS service (1.1.1.1) with malicious query traffic to boost their domain's popularity while undermining trust in the rankings. Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince also confirmed that the botnet's behavior was severely distorting the ranking system and added that Cloudflare now redacts or completely hides suspected malicious domains to avoid similar incidents in the future.</p>


<p>​As Cloudflare revealed in its 2025 Q1 DDoS Report in April, it <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cloudflare-mitigates-record-number-of-ddos-attacks-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">mitigated a record number of DDoS attacks</a> last year, with a 198% quarter-over-quarter jump and a massive 358% year-over-year increase.</p>


<p>In total, it blocked 21.3 million DDoS attacks targeting its customers throughout 2024, as well as another 6.6 million attacks targeting its own infrastructure during an 18-day multi-vector campaign.</p>

Flock cameras are sold to the gullible and the complicit as simple “license plate readers.” Flock cameras are designed to watch cars. For safety, of course. Because crime. But they are much more. </span></p><p><span>The theory is </span><a href="https://www.govtech.com/biz/flock-safety-gives-users-expanded-vehicle-location-abilities" rel="">this</a><span>: </span></p><blockquote><p>Flock Safety, a fast-growing startup that helps law enforcement find vehicles from fixed cameras, has released a slew of new features meant to make it easier for users to locate vehicles of interest.</p><p>Overall, the moves push the company’s software in the direction of giving police the ability to search for vehicles using whatever cameras are at their disposal — a security camera at an ATM, a homeowner’s Ring doorbell, even a photo somebody took on their cellphone. The company’s new Advanced Search package — which costs between $2,500 and $5,000 a year, depending on how many of Flock Safety’s cameras the agency operates — includes a feature that allows users to upload a picture of a vehicle from any source and then perform a search to see if any of the company’s cameras have seen it.</p><p>It doesn’t just search for license plates, either. The company has designed its software to recognize vehicle features such as paint color, type of vehicle and distinguishing features such as roof racks.</p></blockquote><p><span>The tell is in the name: Flock </span><em>Safety</em><span>. Because “keeping you safe” is the reason for every intrusion. As one police-oriented site </span><a href="https://solutions.lpresearch.org/listing/flock-cameras/" rel="">puts it</a><span> (note: “you” here is the cops):</span></p><blockquote><p>7/10 crimes are committed with the use of a vehicle. Capture the vehicle details you need to track leads and solve crime. Flock Safety’s patented Vehicle Fingerprint™ technology lets you search by vehicle make, color, type, license plate, state of the license plate, missing plate, covered plate, paper plate, and unique vehicle details like roof racks, bumper stickers, and more.</p></blockquote><p>The reach is stunning in breadth. Flock captures everything it sees. Everything. Not just vehicles. People. Everything. </p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://neuburger.substack.com/p/cities-panic-over-having-to-release?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://neuburger.substack.com/p/cities-panic-over-having-to-release?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>Think that’s a problem? So does a Washington state judge, who ruled that the sweep is so great that </span><a href="https://www.newsbreak.com/share/4340028007520-a-judge-s-decision-just-made-cities-panic-over-what-their-cameras-recorded" rel="">its data is a public record</a><span>. Public means open to all. </span></p><p>That freaked out so many towns that the company is starting to lose contracts.</p><blockquote><p><span>Across the United States, thousands of automated license plate readers quietly watch the roads. Some ride along in </span><a href="https://www.carscoops.com/2025/10/police-run-over-biker-high-speed-chase-video/" rel="">police cruisers</a><span> </span><em>[note: unrelated link, but a helluva story]</em><span>, others perch on telephone poles or hang above intersections, clicking away as cars glide past. They record everything in sight, regardless of who’s behind the wheel.</span></p><p>It’s a vast, largely invisible network, one that most people never think twice about until it makes the news.</p><p>Well, it turns out that those pictures are public data, according to a judge’s recent ruling. And almost as soon as the decision landed, local officials scrambled to shut the cameras down.</p></blockquote><p>The tale behind the case is interesting:</p><blockquote><p>The ruling stems from a civil case involving the Washington cities of Sedro-Woolley and Stanwood. Both sued to block public records requests filed by Oregon resident Jose Rodriguez. He works in Walla Walla and sought to access the images as part of a broader inquiry into government surveillance.</p><p>Judge Elizabeth Yost Neidzwski sided with Rodriguez, concluding that the data “do qualify as public records subject to the Public Records Act.”</p><p>The decision immediately led both cities to deactivate their Flock systems. Flock cameras are mounted along public roadways and continuously photograph passing vehicles, including occupants, regardless of whether any crime is suspected.</p></blockquote><p><span>Concerns about privacy are central to the case. City attorneys, defending against Rodriguez’s suit, said releasing the data would compromise the privacy of innocents. But they saw no problem with the </span><em>government</em><span> keeping the same data. </span></p><p><span>This gets us to the central problem of today’s surveillance state. No one running the cameras wants to be observed. One reason that city officials object to releasing Flock data, for example, must that they themselves are among the recorded. The cameras are on them too; they too can be tracked. Everything means </span><em>everything</em><span> for these everywhere cameras. </span></p><p>The rich want to hide their crimes (hello, Mr. Epstein’s friends). ICE wants to mask its thugs.

The long story short is that the DNS for DynamoDB was impacted for <code>us-east-1</code>, which created a health event for the entire region. It's the worst incident we've seen in a decade. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/101925/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disney+</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/101925/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lyft</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/101925/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McDonald'ss</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/101925/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/101925/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>, and the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/20/amazon-web-services-outage-takes-down-major-websites.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list goes on</a> were lining up to claim their share too of the spotlight. And we've been watching because our product is part of our customers critical infrastructure. This one graph of the event says it all:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Route 53 Health Check result where us-east-1 is down" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/route53healthcheck-175155e6db205fcb2ce60e342835f530.png" width="1319" height="695"></p><p>The AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/101925/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post-incident report</a> indicates that at 7:48 PM UTC DynamoDB had <em>"increased error rates"</em>. But this article isn't about AWS, and instead I want to share <strong>how exactly we were still up when when AWS was down.</strong></p><p>Now you might be thinking: <strong><em>why are you running infra in us-east-1?</em></strong></p><p>And it's true, almost no one should be using us-east-1, unless, well, of course, you are us. And that's because we end up running our infrastructure where our customers are. In theory, practice and theory are the same, but in practice they differ. And if our (or your) customers chose <code>us-east-1</code> in AWS, then realistically, that means you are also choosing us-east-1 😅.</p><p>During this time, us-east-1 was offline, and while we only run a limited amount of infrastructure in the region, we have to run it there because we have customers who want it there. And even without a direct dependency on <code>us-east-1</code>, there are critical services in AWS — CloudFront, Certificate Manager, Lambda@Edge, and IAM — that all have their control planes in that region. Attempting to create distributions or roles at that time were also met with significant issues.</p><p>Since there are plenty of articles in the wild talking about <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/what-caused-the-large-aws-outage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what actually happened</a>, <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2025/aws-15-hour-outage-5-big-ai-dns-ec2-and-data-center-keys-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why it happened</a>, and <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/20/aws_outage_amazon_brain_drain_corey_quinn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why it will continue to happen</a>, I don't need to go into it here. Instead, I'm going to share a dive about exactly what we've built to avoid these exact issues, and what you can do for your applications and platforms as well. In this article, I'll review how we maintain a high SLI to match our SLA <strong>reliability</strong> commitment even when the infrastructure and services we use don't.</p><h2 id="reliability">📖 What is reliability?<a href="#reliability" aria-label="Direct link to 📖 What is reliability?" title="Direct link to 📖 What is reliability?">​</a></h2><p>Before I get to the part where I share how we built one of the most reliable <a href="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/articles/auth-situation-report">auth solutions</a> available. I want to define reliability. And for us, that's an SLA of five nines. I think that's so extraordinary that the question I want you to keep in mind through this article is: <strong>is that actually possible?</strong> Is it really achievable to have a service with a five nines SLA? When I say five nines, I mean that 99.999% of the time, our service is up and running as expected by our customers. And to put this into perspective, the red, in the sea of blue, represents just how much time we can be down.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="What does 5 nines look like" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/how-much-is-5-nines-c194bc4c40bc0b3cce3e6b43112048f0.png" width="1283" height="176"></p><p>And if you can't see it, it's hiding inside this black dot. It amounts to just five minutes and 15 seconds per year. This pretty much means we have to be up all the time, providing responses and functionality exactly as our customers expect.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="5 nines on the timescale of a year" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/how-much-is-5-nines-red-dot-1333ca56c8c7cd5d1ba066a244213394.png" width="1271" height="566"></p><h2 id="but-why">🤔 But why?<a href="#but-why" aria-label="Direct link to 🤔 But why?" title="Direct link to 🤔 But why?">​</a></h2><p>To put it into perspective, it's important to share for a moment, the specific challenges that we face, why we built what we built, and of course why that's relevant. To do that, I need to include some details about what we're building — what <a href="https://authress.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Authress actually does</a>. Authress provides login and access control for the software applications that you write — It generates JWTs for your applications. This means:</p><ul><li>User authentication and authorization</li><li>User identities</li><li>Granular role and resource-based authorization (ReBAC, ABAC, TBAC, RBAC, etc...)</li><li>API keys for your technical customers to interact with your own APIs</li><li>Machine to machine authentication, or services — if you have a microservice architecture.</li><li>Audit trails to track the permission changes within your services or expose this to your customers.</li></ul><p>And there are of course many more components, that help complete full auth-platform, but they aren't totally relevant to this article, so I'm going to skip over them.</p><p>With that, you may already start to be able to see why uptime is so critical for us. <strong>We're on the critical path for our customers</strong>. It's not inherently true for every single platform, but it is for us. So if our solution is down, then our customer applications are down as well.</p><p>If we put the reliability part in the back corner for one second and just think about the features, we can theorize about a potential initial architecture. That is, an architecture that just focuses on the features, how might you build this out as simple as possible? I want to do this, so I can help explain all the issues that we would face with the simple solution.</p><p>Maybe you've got a single region, and in that region you have some sort of HTTP router that handles requests and they forward to some compute, serverless, container, or virtual machine, or, and I'm very sorry for the scenario — if you have to use bare metal. Lastly, you're interacting with some database, NoSQL, SQL, or something else, file storage, and maybe there's some async components.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The simplest auth architecture" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/initial-architecture-36b5d669429755d471abd1d58a1535ba.png" width="1204" height="555"></p><p>If you take a look at this, it's probably obvious to you (and everyone else) that there is no way it is going to meet our reliability needs. But we have to ask, just exactly how often will there actually be a problem with this architecture? Just building out complexity doesn't directly increase reliability, we need to focus on why this architecture would fail. For us, we use AWS, so I look to the Amazon CTO for guidance, and he's famously quoted as saying, <em><strong>Everything fails all the time</strong></em>.</p><p>And AWS's own services are no exception to this. Over the last decade, we've seen numerous incidents:</p><ul><li>2014 - Ireland (Partial) - Hardware - Transformer failed - EC2, EBS, and RDS</li><li>2016 - Sydney (Partial) - Severe Weather - Power Loss - All Services</li><li>2017 - All Regions - Human error - S3 critical servers deleted - S3</li><li>2018 - Seoul Region - Human error - DNS resolvers impacted - EC2</li><li>2021 - Virginia - Traffic Scaling - Network Control Plane outage - All Services</li><li>2021 - California - Traffic Scaling - Network Control Plane outage - All Services</li><li>2021 - Frankfurt (Partial) - Fire - Fire Suppression System issues - All Services</li><li>2023 - Virginia - Kinesis issues - Scheduling Lambda Invocations impact - Lambda</li><li>2023 - Virginia - Networking issues - Operational issue - Lambda, Fargate, API Gateway…</li><li>2023 - Oregon (Partial) - Error rates - Dynamodb + 48 services</li><li>2024 - Singapore (Partial) - EC2 Autoscaling - EC2</li><li>2024 - Virginia (Partial) - Describe API Failures ECS - ECS + 4 services</li><li>2024 - Brazil - ISP issues - CloudFront connectivity - CloudFront</li><li>2024 - Global - Network connectivity - STS Service</li><li>2024 - Virginia - Message size overflow - Kinesis down - Lambda, S3, ECS, CloudWatch, Redshift</li><li><strong>2025 - Virginia - Dynamo DB DNS - DynamoDB down - All Services</strong></li></ul><p>And any one of these would have caused major problems for us and therefore our customers. And the frequency of incident is actually increasing in time. This shouldn't be a surprise, right? Cloud adoption is increasing over time. The number of services AWS is offering is also increasing. But how impactful are these events? Would single one of them have been a problem for us to actually reach our SLA promise? What would happen if we just trusted AWS and used that to pass through our commitments? Would it be sufficient to achieve 99.999% SLA uptime? Well, let's take a look.</p><h2 id="aws">🕰️ AWS SLA Commitments<a href="#aws" aria-label="Direct link to 🕰️ AWS SLA Commitments" title="Direct link to 🕰️ AWS SLA Commitments">​</a></h2><h4 id="the-aws-lambda-sla-is-below-5-nines">The AWS Lambda SLA is below 5 nines<a href="#the-aws-lambda-sla-is-below-5-nines" aria-label="Direct link to The AWS Lambda SLA is below 5 nines" title="Direct link to The AWS Lambda SLA is below 5 nines">​</a></h4><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Lambda SLA" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/lambda-sla-a4d87b72819203815380229225a332f9.png" width="1307" height="475"></p><h4 id="the-api-gateway-sla-is-below-5-nines">The API Gateway SLA is below 5 nines<a href="#the-api-gateway-sla-is-below-5-nines" aria-label="Direct link to The API Gateway SLA is below 5 nines" title="Direct link to The API Gateway SLA is below 5 nines">​</a></h4><p><img loading="lazy" alt="API Gateway SLA" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/api-gateway-sla-f263c0452ec0d45283d0d7375b49d0ef.png" width="1299" height="407"></p><h4 id="the-aws-sqs-sla-is-below-5-nines">The AWS SQS SLA is below 5 nines<a href="#the-aws-sqs-sla-is-below-5-nines" aria-label="Direct link to The AWS SQS SLA is below 5 nines" title="Direct link to The AWS SQS SLA is below 5 nines">​</a></h4><p><img loading="lazy" alt="SQS SLA" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/sqs-sla-1055fc9668c15c2e53ea324f07db43df.png" width="1301" height="388"></p><p>Okay, so when it comes to trusting AWS SLAs, it isn't sufficient. At. All.</p><p>We can't just use the components that are offered by AWS, and go from there. We fundamentally need to do something more than that. So the question becomes, what exactly must a dependency's reliability be in order for us to utilize it? To answer that question, it's time for a math lesson. Or more specifically, everyone's favorite topic, <strong>probabilities</strong>.</p><p>Let's quickly get through this <del>torture</del> exercise. Fundamentally, you have endpoints in your service, and you get in an HTTP request, and it interacts with some third-party component or API, and then you write the result to a database.

But the full answer is: have a health check that validates both of the regions, checking if the region is up, or is there an incident? And if it is, reports the results to the DNS router.</p><p>We could be utilizing the default provided handler from AWS Route 53 or a third-party component which pings our website, but that's not accurate enough from a standpoint of correctly and knowing for certain that our services are in fact down.</p><p>It would be devastating for us to fail over when a secondary region is having worse problems than our primary region. Or what if there's an issue with with network traffic. We wouldn't know if that's an issue of communication between AWS's infrastructure services, or an issue with the default Route 53 health check endpoint, or some entangled problem with how those specifically interact with our code that we're actually utilizing. So it became a requirement to built something ourselves, custom, to actually execute exactly what we need to check.</p><p>Here is a representation of what we're doing. It's not exactly what we are doing, but it's close enough to be useful. Health check request come in from the Route 53 Health Check. They call into our APIGW or Load Balancer as a router. The requests are passed to our compute which can interact and validate logic, code, access, and data in the database:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The health check endpoint architecture" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/dns-health-check-5aad726de934354da648cffb60004d10.png" width="892" height="473"></p><p>The health check executes this code on request that allows us to validate if the region is in fact healthy:</p><div><p>Region HealthCheck validation</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>Authorizer</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'./authorizer.js'</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>ModelValidator</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'./modelValidator.js'</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>healthCheck</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>await</span><span> profiler</span><span>.</span><span>start</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> dynamoDbCheck </span><span>=</span><span> accountDatabase</span><span>.</span><span>getDefaultAccount</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> indexerCheck </span><span>=</span><span> indexer</span><span>.</span><span>authorizationCheck</span><span>(</span><span>'HealthCheck'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> sqsValidation </span><span>=</span><span> sqsClient</span><span>.</span><span>queue</span><span>(</span><span>'LiveCheck'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> authorizer </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Authorizer</span><span>.</span><span>validate</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> modelValidation </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>ModelValidator</span><span>.</span><span>validate</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>try</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>await</span><span> </span><span>Promise</span><span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>          dynamoDbCheck</span><span>,</span><span> indexerCheck</span><span>,</span><span> sqsValidation</span><span>,</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>          authorizer</span><span>,</span><span> modelValidation </span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>catch</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        logger</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'HealthCheck Failed'</span><span>,</span><span> error</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>statusCode</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>503</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>await</span><span> profiler</span><span>.</span><span>end</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>statusCode</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>200</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div><ol><li>We start a profiler to know how long our requests are taking.</li><li>Then we interact with our databases, as well as validate some secondary components, such as SQS. While issues with secondary components may not always be a reason to failover, they can cause impacts to response time, and those indicators can be used to predict incoming incidents.</li><li>From there, we check whether or not the most critical business logic is working correctly. In our case, that's interactions with DynamoDB as well as core authorizer logic. Compared to a simple unit test, this accounts for corruption in a deployment package, as well instances where some subtle differences between regions interact with our code base. We can catch those sorts of problems here, and know that the primary region that we're utilizing, one of the six, is having a problem and automatically update the DNS based on this.</li><li>When we're done, we return success or failure so the health check can track changes.</li></ol><h2 id="improvement">🌿 Improving the Failover Strategy<a href="#improvement" aria-label="Direct link to 🌿 Improving the Failover Strategy" title="Direct link to 🌿 Improving the Failover Strategy">​</a></h2><p>And we don't stop here with our infrastructure failover however. With the current strategy, it's good, in some cases, even sufficient. But it isn't that great. For starters, we have to completely failover. If there's just one component that's problematic, we can't just swap that one out easily, it's all or nothing with the Route 53 health check. So when possible, we push for an edge-optimized architecture. In AWS, this means utilizing <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS CloudFront</a> with AWS Lambda@Edge for compute. This not only helps reduce latency for our customers and their end users depending where they are around the world, as a secondary benefit, fundamentally, it is an improved failover strategy.</p><p>And that looks like this:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="CloudFront Edge Failover" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/edge-failover-1c7bc4a076542e0b3b8f257cf031f523.gif" width="1393" height="531"></p><p>Using CloudFront gives us a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/charting-the-life-of-an-amazon-cloudfront-request/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highly reliable CDN</a>, which routes requests to the locally available compute region. From there, we can interact with the local database. When our database in that region experiences a health incident, we automatically failover, and check the database in a second adjacent region. And when there's a problem there as well, we do it again to a third region. We can do that because when utilizing DynamoDB we have <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/global-tables/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Tables</a> configured for authorization configuration. In places where we don't need the data duplicated, we just interact with the table in a different region without replication.</p><p>After a third region with an issue, <strong>we stop.</strong></p><p>And maybe you're asking why three and not four or five or six? Aren't you glad we did the probabilities exercise earlier? Now you can actually figure out why it's three here. But, I'll leave that math as an exercise for you.</p><p>As a quick recap, this handles the problems with at the infrastructure level and with third-party components. And if we solve those, is that sufficient for us to achieve our goal the 5-nines SLA?</p><p>For us the answer is <strong>No</strong>, and you might have guessed, if you peaked at the scrollbar or table contents that there are still quite some additional components integrated into our solution. One of them is knowing that at some point, there's going to be a bug in our code, unfortunately.</p><h2 id="application">💻 Application level failures<a href="#application" aria-label="Direct link to 💻 Application level failures" title="Direct link to 💻 Application level failures">​</a></h2><p>And that bug will get committed to production, which means we're going to end up with an application failure. It should be obvious that it isn't achievable to write completely bug-free code. Maybe there is someone out there that thinks that, and maybe even that's you, and I believe you that you believe that. However, I know it's not me, and realistically, I don't want to sit around and pray that it's also my fellow team members. The risk is too high, because in the case something does get into production, that means it can impact some of our customers. So instead, let's assume that will happen and design a strategy around it.</p><p>So when it does happen, we of course have to trigger our incident response. For us, we send out an email, we post a message on our community and internal communication workspaces, and start an on-call alert. The technology here isn't so relevant, but tools like AWS SES, SQS, SNS, Discord, and emails are involved.</p><p>Incidents wake an engineer up, so someone can start to take look at the incident, and most likely the code.</p><p>But by the time they even respond to the alert, let alone actually investigate and fix the cause of the incident, we would long violated our SLA. So an alert is not sufficient for us. We need to also implement automation to automatically remediate any of these problems. Now, I'm sure you're thinking, <em>yeah, okay, test automation</em>. You might even be thinking about an LLM agent that can automatically create PRs. (Side note: LLM code generation, doesn't actually work for us, and I'll get to that a little further down) Instead, we have to rely on having sufficient testing in place. And yes, of course we do. We test before deployment. There is no better time to test.</p><p>This seems simple and an obvious answer, and I hope that for anyone reading this article it is. Untested code never goes to production. Every line of code is completely tested before it is merged to production, even if it is enabled on some flag. Untested code is never released, it is far too dangerous. Untested code never makes it to production behind some magic flag. Abusing feature flags to make that happen could not be a worse decision for us. And that's because we can need to be as confident as possible before those changes actually get out in front of our customers. The result is — we don't focus on test coverage percentage, but rather <strong>test value</strong>. That is, which areas provide most value, that are most risky, that we care about being the most reliable for our customers. Those are the ones we focus on testing.</p><h3 id="root-cause-analysis-rca">Root Cause Analysis (RCA)<a href="#root-cause-analysis-rca" aria-label="Direct link to Root Cause Analysis (RCA)" title="Direct link to Root Cause Analysis (RCA)">​</a></h3><p><strong>Every incident could have been prevented if we just had one more test.</strong> The trick though is actually having that right test, before the incident.</p><p>And in reality, that's not actually possible. Having every right test for a service that is constantly changing, while new features are being added, is just unmaintainable. Every additional test we write increases the maintenance burden of our service. Attempting to achieve 100% complete test coverage would require an infinite amount of time. This is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pareto Principle</a>, more commonly the 80-20 rule. If it takes 20% of the time to deliver 80% of the tests, it takes an infinite amount of time to achieve all the tests, and that assumes that the source code isn't changing.</p><p>The result is we'll never be able to catch everything. <strong>So we can't just optimize for prevention. We also need to optimize for recovery.</strong> This conclusion for us means also implementing tests against our deployed production code. One example of this are validation tests.</p><h2 id="validation-tests">📋 Validation Tests<a href="#validation-tests" aria-label="Direct link to 📋 Validation Tests" title="Direct link to 📋 Validation Tests">​</a></h2><p>A validation test is where you have some data in one format and data in another format and you use those two different formats to ensure referential consistency. (Side note: There are many different kinds of tests, and I do a deep dive in <a href="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/academy/topics/user-impersonation-risks#solution-b-dom-recording">the different types of tests</a> and how they're relevant in building secure and reliable systems). One concrete example could be you have a request that comes in, you end up logging the request data and the response, then you can compare that logged data to what's actually saved in your database.</p><p>In our scenario, which focuses on the authorization and permissions enforcement checks, we have multiple databases with similar data. In one case, there's the storage of permissions as well as the storage of the expected checks and the audit trail tracking the creation of those permissions. So we actually have multiple opportunities to compare the data between our databases asynchronously outside of customer critical path usage.</p><h3 id="running-the-validation">Running the Validation<a href="#running-the-validation" aria-label="Direct link to Running the Validation" title="Direct link to Running the Validation">​</a></h3><p>On a schedule, via an AWS CloudWatch Scheduled Rule, we load the data from our different databases and we compare them against each other to make sure it is consistent. If there is a problem, then if this fires off an incident before any of our customers notice, so that we can actually go in and check what's going on.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The architecture flow to trigger the validation tests" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/validation-tests-798e04b9ad9c3f9ba86c40b645e162ed.png" width="899" height="638"></p><p>This sounds bad on the surface that it could ever happen. But the reality of the situation is that a discrepancy can show up as a result of any number of mechanisms. For instance, the infrastructure from AWS could have corrupted one of the database shards and what is written to the databases is inconsistent. We know that this can happen as there is no 100% guarantee on database durability, even from AWS. <strong>AWS does not guarantee Database Durability</strong>, are you assuming they do, because we don't! So actually reading the data back and verifying its internal consistency is something that we must do.</p><p>While it might not seem that this could reduce the probability of there being an incident. Consider that a requested user permission check whose result doesn't match our customer's expectation is an incident. It might not always be one that anyone identifies or even becomes aware of, but it nonetheless a problem, just like a publicly exposed S3 is technically an issue, even if no one has exfiltrated the data yet, it doesn't mean the bucket isn'is sufficiently secured.</p><h2 id="-incident-impact">🎯 Incident Impact<a href="#-incident-impact" aria-label="Direct link to 🎯 Incident Impact" title="Direct link to 🎯 Incident Impact">​</a></h2><p>There are two parts to the actual risk of an incident. The probability and the impact. Everything in this article I've discuss until now talks about reducing the probability of an incident, that is — the likelihood of it happening. But since we know that we can't avoid ever having an incident, we also have to reduce the impact when it happens.</p><p>One way we do that is by utilizing an <strong>incremental rollout</strong>. Hopefully everyone knows what incremental rollout is, so I'll instead jump straight into how we accomplish it utilizing AWS. And for that we focus again on our solution integrating with CloudFront and our edge architecture.</p><p>The solution for us is what I call <strong>Customer Deployment Buckets</strong>. We bucket individual customers into separate buckets and then deploy to each of the buckets sequentially. If the deployment rolls out without a problem, and it's all green, that is everything works correctly, then we go on to the second bucket and then deploy our code to there, and then the third bucket, and so on and so forth until every single customer has the new version.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Rolling out to customer buckets one at a time" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/bucket-roll-out-39ed3214efbaaf15ad96e8e1ca84df26.gif" width="1393" height="605"></p><p>If there is an issue, we stop the rollout and we go and investigate what's actually going on. While we can't prevent the issue from happening to the earlier buckets, we are able to stop that issue from propagating to more customers, having an impact on everyone, and thus reduce the impact of the incident.</p><p>As I mentioned before the biggest recurring issue isn't executing an operations process during an incident, it's identifying there is a real incident in the first place. So, <strong>How do we actually know that there's an issue?</strong></p><p>If it was an easy problem to solve, you would have written a unit task or <a href="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/academy/topics/user-impersonation-risks#solution-b-dom-recording">integration test or service level test</a> and thus already discovered it, right? So adding tests can't, by design, help us. Maybe there's an issue with the deployment itself or during infrastructure creation, but likely that's not what's happening.</p><p>Now, I know you're thinking, <em><strong>When is he going to get to AI?</strong></em></p><p>Whether or not we'll ever truly have AI is a separate <code>&lt;rant /&gt;</code> that I won't get into here, so this is the only section on it, I promise. What we actually do is better called <strong>anomaly detection.</strong> Historically anomaly detection, was what AI always meant, true AI, rather than an LLM or agent in any way.</p><h2 id="-ai-anomaly-detection">🔎 AI: Anomaly Detection<a href="#-ai-anomaly-detection" aria-label="Direct link to 🔎 AI: Anomaly Detection" title="Direct link to 🔎 AI: Anomaly Detection">​</a></h2><p>This is a graph of our detection analysis:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="namely detection graph" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/anomaly-detection-bd49cd74a6c145c9470df317dd14f87c.png" width="2397" height="1289"></p><p>You might notice that it's not tracking 400s or 500s, which are in reality relatively easy to detect. But in fact don't actually tell us meaningfully what's wrong with our service or whether or not there really is a problem. Impact is measured by business value, not technical protocol level analytics, so we need to have a business-focused metric.</p><p>And for us, at Authress, the business-focussed metric we use to identify meaningful incidents we call: <strong>The Authorization Ratio</strong>. That is the ratio of successful logins and authorizations to ones that are blocked, rejected, timeout or are never completed for some reason.</p><p>The above CloudWatch metric display contains this exact ratio, and here in this timeframe represents an instance not too long ago where we got really close to firing off our alert.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Anomaly Detection allowance bands" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/anomaly-detection-reveal-47ec9d2e0f410a6e8b4f12bc771c7fe4.png" width="2393" height="1283"></p><p>Here, there was a slight elevation of errors soon after a deployment. The expected ratio was outside of our allowance span for a short period of time. However not long enough to trigger an incident. We still investigated, but it wasn't something that required immediate remediation. And it's a good reminder that identifying problems in any production software isn't so straightforward. To achieve high reliability, we've needed an AI or in this case anomaly detection to actually identify additional problems. And realistically, even with this level of sophistication in place, we still can never know with 100% certainty that there is actually an incident at any moment. And that's because "what is an incident", is actually a philosophical question...</p><h2 id="-does-it-smell-like-an-incident">🌹 Does it smell like an incident?<a href="#-does-it-smell-like-an-incident" aria-label="Direct link to 🌹 Does it smell like an incident?" title="Direct link to 🌹 Does it smell like an incident?">​</a></h2><p>Our anomaly detection said – almost an incident, and we determined the result – no incident. But does that mean there wasn't an incident? What makes an incident, how do I define an incident? And is that exact definition ubiquitous, for every system, every engineer, every customer?</p><p>Obviously not, and one look at the <a href="https://health.console.aws.amazon.com/health/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Health Status Dashboard</a> is all you need to determine that the identification of incidents is based on subjective perspective, rather than objective criteria. What's actually more important is the synthesis of our perspective on the situation and what our customers believe. To see what I mean, let's do a comparison:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="incident perspective comparison" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/perspective-comparison-200862c120ae03c4498bb7a36cff5b0b.png" width="1325" height="854"></p><p>I'm going to use Authress as an example. So I've got the product services perspective on one side and our customer's perspective on the other.</p><h3 id="incident-alignment">Incident Alignment<a href="#incident-alignment" aria-label="Direct link to Incident Alignment" title="Direct link to Incident Alignment">​</a></h3><p>In the top left corner we have alignment. If we believe that our system is up and working and our customers do, too, then success, all good. Everything's working as expected.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="incident perspective comparison alignment" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/perspective-comparison-good-4ec1a8786538f8395523e06d741d1e49.png" width="1084" height="698"></p><p>Inversely in the opposite corner, maybe there is a problem. We believe that one of our services is having an issue, and successfully, we're able to identify it. Most importantly, our customers say–yes, there is an issue for us.</p><p>It's not great that there's an incident, but as I've identified incidents will absolutely happen, and the fact we've correctly aligned with our customers on the problem's existence independently allows us to deploy automation to automatically remediate the issue. That's a success! If it's a new problem that we haven't seen before, we can even design new automation to fix this. Correctly identifying incidents is challenging, so doing that step correctly, leads itself very well to automation for remediation.</p><h3 id="perspective-mismatch">Perspective Mismatch<a href="#perspective-mismatch" aria-label="Direct link to Perspective Mismatch" title="Direct link to Perspective Mismatch">​</a></h3><p>One interesting corner is when our customers believe that there's nothing wrong, there have been no incidents reported, but all our alerts are saying – <em>RED ALERT</em> — someone has to go look at this!</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="incident perspective mismatch" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/perspective-comparison-mismatch-05c9e8f5abb0ca87192d36bf4ace33b2.png" width="1324" height="853"></p><p>In this case, our alerts have identified a problem that no one cares about. This often happens in scenarios where our customers are in one region, Switzerland for example, with local region users, a health care, manufacturing, or e-commerce app, is a good example, rather than global, who are likely asleep at 2:00 AM. And that means an incident at the moment, could be an issue affecting some customers. But if they aren't around to experience it, is it actually happening?</p><p>You are probably wincing at that idea. There's a bug, it must be fixed! And sure that's a problem, it's happening and we should take note of what's going on. But we don't need to respond in real time. That's a waste of our resources where we could be investing in other things. Why wake up our engineers based on functionality that no one is using?</p><p>I think one of the most interesting categories is in the top right-hand corner where:</p><ul><li>our customers say, <em>"hey, your service is down"</em></li><li>But we say, "Wait, really, is it?"_</li></ul><p>This is known as a <strong>gray failure</strong>.</p><h3 id="gray-failures">Gray Failures<a href="#gray-failures" aria-label="Direct link to Gray Failures" title="Direct link to Gray Failures">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Gray failures identified" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/perspective-comparison-gray-1270ef7b4fe8e4235852527688a4e059.png" width="1082" height="695"></p><p>And it can happen for any number of reasons. Maybe there is something in our knowledge base that tells our customers to do something one way and it's confusing and they've interpreted it in a different way. So there's a different expectation here. That expectation can get codified into customer processes and product services.</p><p>Or maybe our customer is running different tests from us, ones that are of course, valuable for their business, but not ones that we consider. Or more likely they are just using a less resilient cloud provider.</p><p>Most fundamentally, there could really be an incident, something that we haven't detected yet, but they have. And if we don't respond to that, it could grow, and left unchecked, escalate, and eventually impact all our customers. This means we need to give our customers an easy way to report incidents to us, which we can immediately follow up with.</p><p>For us, every single incident, every single customer support ticket that comes into our platform, we immediately and directly send it to our engineering team. Now, I often get pushback on this from other leaders. I'm sure, even you might be thinking something like — <em>I don't want to be on call for customer support incidents.</em> But if you throw additional tiers in your organization between your engineering teams and your customers, that means you're increasing the time to actually start investigating and resolving those problems. If you have two tiers before your engineering team and each tier has its own SLA of 10 minutes to triage the issue, that means you've already gone through 20 minutes before an engineer even knows about it and can go and look at it. That violates our SLA by fourfold before investigation and remediation can even begin.</p><p>Instead, in those scenarios, what I actually recommend thinking about is how might you reduce the number of support tickets you receive in aggregate? This is the much more appropriate way to look at the problem. If you are getting support tickets that don't make sense, then you've got to investigate, <em>why did we get this ticket?</em> Do the root cause analysis on the ticket, not just the issue mentioned in it — why the ticket was even created in the first place.</p><p>A ticket means: Something is broken. From there, we can figure out, OK, maybe we need to improve our documentation. Or we need to change what we're doing on one of our endpoints. Or we need to change the response error message we're sending. But you can always go deeper.</p><h3 id="the-customer-support-advantage">The customer support advantage<a href="#the-customer-support-advantage" aria-label="Direct link to The customer support advantage" title="Direct link to The customer support advantage">​</a></h3><p>And going deeper, means  customer support is critical for us. We consider customer support to be the lifeline of our service level agreement (SLA). If we didn't have that advantage, then we might not have been able to deliver our commitment at all. So much so that we report some of our own CloudWatch custom metrics to our customers so they can have an aggregate view of both what they know internally and what we believe. We do this through our own internal dashboard in our application management UIs.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Authress metric dashboard" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/authress-dashboard-3ccee084978cd39a3efb082eab304689.png" width="2103" height="1407"></p><p><strong>Helping our users identify incidents benefits us; because we can't catch everything.

That's because we also have to deal with negligence and malice.</p><p>We're in a privileged position to have numerous security researchers out there on the internet constantly trying to find vulnerabilities within our service. For transparency, I have some of those reports I want to share:</p><h3 id="real-vulnerability-reports">“Real” Vulnerability Reports<a href="#real-vulnerability-reports" aria-label="Direct link to “Real” Vulnerability Reports" title="Direct link to “Real” Vulnerability Reports">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" alt="fake vulnerability disclosure" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/vulnerability-disclosure-1-27dc85ac57155d84fb110a716533bf96.png" width="2473" height="1219"></p><blockquote><p>I am a web security researcher enthusiast. Do you give a monetary reward?</p></blockquote><p>Okay, this isn't starting out that great. What else have we received?</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="appeal to ethical hacking rewards" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/vulnerability-disclosure-2-c1ea2887c9c81e5d076d8a2c24cc6ed0.png" width="2472" height="1080"></p><blockquote><p>I found some vulnerabilities in your website. Do you offer rewards for ethical hackers?</p></blockquote><p>Well, maybe, but I think you would actually need to answer for us, what the problem actually is. And you also might notice this went to our spam. It didn't even get to our inbox. So a lot of help they might be providing. Actually we ignore any <em>”security”</em> email sent from a non-custom domain.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Phishing attempt using our own credentials" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/vulnerability-disclosure-3-809289836ba4c4b9e8a70b6fe091a21c.png" width="1801" height="1265"></p><p>This one was really interesting. We had someone attempting to phish our engineering team by creating a support ticket and putting in some configuration trying to get us to provide them our own credentials to one of our third-party dependencies. Interestingly enough, our teams don't even have access to those credentials directly.</p><p>And, we know this was malicious because the credentials that they are referencing in the support request are from our honey pot, stuck in our UI to explicitly catch these sorts of things. The only way to get these credentials is if they hacked around our UI application and pulled out of the HTML. They aren't readily available any other way. So it was very easy for us to detect that this “report” was actually a social engineering attack.</p><p>And this is one of my favorites, and I can't make this up:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Bugbounty vulnerability reporting" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/vulnerability-disclosure-4-75fd0339199af159cacce860f1216779.png" width="2463" height="1215"></p><blockquote><p>I have found many security loophole. How much will you pay if you want to working with me like project?</p></blockquote><p>That's the exact quote, I don't even know what that means. Unfortunately, LLMs will actually start to make all of these future "vulnerability reports" sound more appealing to read in the future, for better or worse. However, at the end of the day, the truth is that these are harmless. And we actually do have a <a href="https://authress.io/app/#/disclosure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">security disclosure program</a> that anyone can go and submit problems for. I hope the message to white-hat hackers is please use that process, and the legitimate reports usually do go through it. Do not send us emails. Those are going to go into the abyss. Alternatively, you can follow our <a href="https://authress.io/.well-known/security.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">security.txt</a> public page or go to the disclosure form, but with email, the wrong people are going to get that and we can't triage effectively.</p><p>Vulnerabilities in our services can result in production incidents for our customers. That means security is part of our SLA. Don't believe me, I'll show you how:</p><h3 id="multitenant-considerations">Multitenant considerations<a href="#multitenant-considerations" aria-label="Direct link to Multitenant considerations" title="Direct link to Multitenant considerations">​</a></h3><p>It's relevant for us, that Authress is a multitenant solution. So some of the resources within our service are in fact shared between customers.</p><p>Additionally, customers could have multiple services in a microservice architecture or multiple components. And one of these services could theoretically consume all of the resources that we've allocated for that customer. In that scenario, that would cause an incident for that customer. So we need to protect against resource exhaustion <strong>Intra-Tenant</strong>. Likewise, we have multiple customers. One of those customers could be consuming more resources than we've allocated to the entire tenant. And that could cause an incident across <strong>Inter-Tenant</strong> and cause an incident across our platform and impact other customers.</p><p>Lastly, we have to be worried about our customers, our customers' customers, and our customers' customers' customers, because any one of those could be malicious and consume their resources and so on and so forth, thus causing a cascading failure. <strong>A failure due to lack of resources is an incident</strong>. The only solution that makes sense for this is, surprise, rate limiting.</p><h3 id="helpful-rate-limiting">Helpful Rate Limiting<a href="#helpful-rate-limiting" aria-label="Direct link to Helpful Rate Limiting" title="Direct link to Helpful Rate Limiting">​</a></h3><p>So we need to rate-limit these requests at different levels for different kinds of clients, different kinds of users, and we do that within our architecture, at different fundamental levels within our infrastructure.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="CloudFront and Region based rate limiting locations" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/waf-architecture-9a4c494204c064580d7fa65b67b0e053.png" width="1790" height="1141"></p><p>Primarily there are protections at our compute level, as well at the region level, and also place protections at a global level. In AWS, this of course means using a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/waf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web application firewall or WAF</a>. I think our WAF configuration is interesting and in some ways novel.</p><p>Fundamentally, one of the things that we love to use is the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-ip-rep.html#aws-managed-rule-groups-ip-rep-amazon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS managed IP reputation list</a>.</p><p>The reputation list is list of IP addresses that have been associated with malicious activity outside of our service throughout other customers at AWS and other providers out there in the world where a problem has been detected. That means before those attacks even get to our service or to our customers' instances of Authress, we can already know to block them, and the WAF does that. This is great, and most importantly, has a very low false positive rate.</p><p>However, the false positive rate is an important metric for consideration of counter measures against malicious attacks or negligent accidental abuse of resources, and something that prevents us from using any other managed rules from AWS or external providers. There's two problems with managed rules, fundamentally:</p><ol><li>Number one is the false positive rate. If that is even a little bit more than, it couldn't be sustainable, and would result in us blocking legitimate requests coming for a customer. This means it is a problem, and it's an incident for them if some of their users can't utilize their software because of something we did. False positives are customer incidents.</li><li>The second one is that managed rules are gratuitously expensive. Lots of companies are building these just to charge you lots of money, and the ROI just doesn't seem to be there. We don't see useful blocks from them.</li></ol><p>But the truth is, we need to do something more than just the reputation list rule.</p><h3 id="handling-requests-at-scale">Handling Requests at Scale<a href="#handling-requests-at-scale" aria-label="Direct link to Handling Requests at Scale" title="Direct link to Handling Requests at Scale">​</a></h3><p>And the thing that we've decided to do is — add blocking for sufficiently high requests. By default, any Authress account's service client that goes above 2,000 requests per second (RPS), we just immediately terminate. Now, this isn't every customer, as there are some out there for us that do require such a high load or even higher (as 2k isn't that high). But for the majority of them, if you get to this number and they haven't talked to us about their volume, then it is probably malicious in some way. You don't magically go from zero to 2,000 one day, unless it is an import job.</p><p>Likewise, we can actually learn about a problem long before it gets to that scale. We have milestones, and we start reporting loads from clients at 100, 200, 500, 1,000, et cetera. If we see clients hitting these load milestones, we can already start to respond and create an incident for us to investigate before they reach a point where they're consuming all of the resources in our services for that customer. And we do this by adding alerts on the COUNT of requests for WAF metrics.</p><p>However, we also get attacks at a smaller scale. Just because we aren't being DDoS-ed doesn't mean there isn't attack. And those requests will still get through because they don't meet our blocking limits. They could be malicious in nature, but only identifiable in aggregate. So while single request might seem fine, if you see the same request 10 times a second, 100 times a second, something is probably wrong. Or if you have request urls that end in <code>.php?admin</code>, when no one has run WordPress in decades, you also know that there's a problem. We catch these by logging all of the blocked requests.</p><p>We have automation in place to query those results and update our rules, but a picture is worth a thousand words:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="WAF COUNT metrics display" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/waf-counts-display-1185348606e0db3f23326dd1f0bb3570.png" width="2185" height="1108"></p><p>Here you can see a query based off of the IP addresses from the client that are being utilized and sorted by frequency. When we get these requests that look non-malicious individually, we execute a query such as this one and we check to see if the results match a pattern. You can use ip address matching or more intelligently, something called the JA3 or JA4 fingerprints of those requests There are actually lots of options available, I'm not going to get into exactly what they are, there are some <a href="https://ramimac.me/waf-ddos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">great articles on the topic</a>. And there are more mechanisms to actually track these used throughout the security industry, and utilizing them let's you instantly identify: <em>Hey, you know what? This request violates one of our patterns, maybe we should block all the requests from that client.</em></p><p>And so, rather than waiting for them to get to the point where an attacker is consuming 2,000 requests per second worth of resources, you can stop there right away. In the cases where we can't make a conclusive decision, this technology gives us another tool that we can utilize to improve our patterns for the future. Maybe it goes without saying, but of course because we've running our technology to many regions around the world, we have to work on deploying this infrastructure in all these places and push it out to the edge where possible.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Authress AWS Regional and Global locations" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/authress-global-locations-03495d352c7ee9fe140f8e7f03a30241.png" width="2112" height="1285"></p><h2 id="-the-conclusion">🎁 The Conclusion<a href="#-the-conclusion" aria-label="Direct link to 🎁 The Conclusion" title="Direct link to 🎁 The Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>I said a lot of things, so I to quickly want to quickly summarize our architecture that we have in place:</p><ol><li><strong>Third-party component reliability reviews</strong>. I can't stress this enough. Don't just assume that you can utilize something. And sometimes in order to achieve 5-nines, you actually have to remove components from your infrastructure. Some things are just not able to be utilized no matter what. Now maybe you can put it in some sort of async background, but it can't be on the critical path for your endpoints.</li><li><strong>DNS failover and health checks.</strong> For places where you have an individual region or availability zone or cluster, having a full backup with a way to conclusively determine what's up and automatically failover is critical.</li><li><strong>Edge compute where possible</strong>. There's a whole network out there of services that are running on top of the cloud providers, which help guarantee your capability to run as close to as possible to where your users are and reduce latency.</li><li><strong>Incremental rollout</strong> for when you want to reduce the impact as much as possible.</li><li>The <strong>Web Application Firewall</strong> for handling those malicious requests.</li><li>Having a <strong>Customer Support Focus</strong> to enable escalating issues that outside your area of detection.</li></ol><p>And through seven years or so that we've been doing this and building up this architecture, there's a couple of things that we've learned:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Unsolvable Problems at scale" src="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/assets/images/lessions-learned-b848a223205afe1959cce537c04d5465.png" width="1356" height="695"></p><h3 id="murphys-law">Murphy's Law<a href="#murphys-law" aria-label="Direct link to Murphy's Law" title="Direct link to Murphy's Law">​</a></h3><p>Everything fails all the time. There absolutely will be failures everywhere. Every line of code, every component you pull in, every library, there's guaranteed to be a problem in each and everyone of those. And you will for sure have to deal with it, at some point. So being prepared to handle that situation, is something you have to be thinking through in your design.</p><h3 id="dns">DNS<a href="#dns" aria-label="Direct link to DNS" title="Direct link to DNS">​</a></h3><p>DNS, yeah, AWS will say it, everyone out there will say, and now we get to say it. The global DNS architecture is pretty good and reliable for a lot of scenarios, but I worry that it's still a single point of failure in a lot of ways.</p><h3 id="infrastructure-as-code-iac">Infrastructure as Code (IAC)<a href="#infrastructure-as-code-iac" aria-label="Direct link to Infrastructure as Code (IAC)" title="Direct link to Infrastructure as Code (IAC)">​</a></h3><p>The last thing is infrastructure as code challenges. We deploy primary regions, but then there's also the backup regions, which are slightly different from the primary regions, and then there are edge compute, which are, again, even more slightly different. And then sometimes, we do this ridiculous thing, where we deploy infrastructure dedicated to one customers. And in doing so, we're running some sort of IaC to deploy those resources.</p><p>It is almost exactly the same architecture. Almost! Because it isn't exactly the same there are quite the opportunities for challenges to sneak it. That's problematic with even Open Tofu or CloudFormation, and often these tools make it more difficult, not less. And good luck to you, if you're still using some else that hasn't been modernized. With those, it's even easier to run into problems and not get it exactly correct.</p><p>The last thing I want to leave you with is, well, <strong>With all of these, is that actually sufficient to achieve five nines?</strong></p><p>No. Our commitment is 5-nines, what we do is in defense of that, just because you do all these things doesn't automatically mean your promise of 5-nines in guaranteed. And you know what, you too can promise a 5-nines SLA without doing anything. You'll likely break your promise, but for us our promise is important, and so this is our defense.</p><div><p><span><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</p><p>For help understanding this article or how you can implement auth and similar security architectures in your services, feel free to reach out to me via the <a href="https://authress.io/community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community server</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/israeli-app-app-cloud-samsung-phones-controversy/">https://www.sammobile.com/news/israeli-app-app-cloud-samsung-phones-controversy/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45955424">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="single-article-content">

                        <p>For years, Samsung has shipped its Galaxy M, F, and A series smartphones in India with a little-known app called <strong>AppCloud</strong>. Despite its name, AppCloud isn’t a cloud storage service. It’s essentially an app-installer that surfaces third-party app recommendations during device setup.
</p><div>
<p>On new Galaxy devices in these lineups, AppCloud appears as part of the initial onboarding and forces users to choose whether they want to install certain apps before setup can be completed. You can postpone this by choosing the “later” option, but the app continues to push a persistent notification until you finish the selection process or disable it entirely. </p>
</div><p>For most users, AppCloud has long been regarded as little more than nuisance bloatware, a side effect of Samsung’s need to generate revenue beyond hardware margins while competing with aggressive Chinese smartphone brands in India.<!-- Either there are no banners, they are disabled or none qualified for this location! -->
</p><p>But findings by the non-profit SMEX <a href="https://smex.org/invasive-israeli-software-is-harvesting-data-from-samsung-users-in-wana/?s=09">from earlier this year</a> suggest AppCloud may not be as harmless as once assumed.
</p><p>
<h3 id="h-appcloud-expansion-into-asian-and-african-markets-has-sparked-scrutiny"><strong>AppCloud expansion into Asian and African markets has sparked scrutiny</strong></h3>
</p><p>Since 2022, Samsung has also been preloading AppCloud on its A and M series phones in several West Asian and North African (WANA) markets. This rollout has triggered privacy concerns due to AppCloud’s ties to ironSource, a company founded in Israel and now owned by US-based Unity.
</p><p>While AppCloud can be disabled, it is difficult to remove without root access. Furthermore, its privacy policy is not easily available online, raising questions about transparency, user consent, and what kind of data the app may collect.<!-- Either there are no banners, they are disabled or none qualified for this location! -->
</p><p>ironSource itself has a controversial track record. The company previously operated an “InstallCore” program that became infamous for installing software without clear user permission and for bypassing security warnings, behavior that resulted in widespread criticism and blacklisting by several anti-malware tools.
</p><p>
<h3 id="h-regional-sensitivities-make-things-more-contentious"><strong>Regional sensitivities make things more contentious</strong></h3>
</p><p>The presence of an Israeli-origin technology component on Samsung phones in WANA countries poses additional problems. Several nations in this region legally bar Israeli companies from operating, and in light of the ongoing Israel–Palestine conflict, the preload of an app tied to such a company becomes even more contentious.<!-- Either there are no banners, they are disabled or none qualified for this location! -->
</p><p>ironSource’s Aura technology, which “optimizes device experiences” by surfacing apps, content, and services directly on smartphones, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/ironsource-expands-samsung-partnership-launching-on-samsung-mobile-devices-in-mena">has been used on Samsung devices</a> in Europe, Russia, and Southeast Asia, and by telecom operators in the US; it also appears to do something similar to AppCloud. However, <strong>AppCloud itself is not listed anywhere on ironSource’s website</strong>, which appears to be the major cause for concern, even though the app is now owned by a US company.
</p><p>While there’s no concrete evidence that AppCloud engages in questionable data practices today, the lack of an accessible privacy policy and ironSource's past reputation are causing anxiety among users.
</p><p>
<h3 id="h-people-want-samsung-to-respond"><strong>People want Samsung to respond</strong></h3>
</p><p>Consumer advocates and privacy-focused users are urging Samsung to take immediate steps, like providing a clear opt-out for AppCloud during setup, making its privacy policy public and accessible, and to stop preloading the app entirely in sensitive regions.
</p><p>With concerns rising across multiple markets, Samsung will likely need to issue a statement to reassure customers. We have reached out to the company for comment and will update this story once we hear back.

	<p>Gemini is a new internet technology supporting an electronic library of interconnected text documents.  That's not a new idea, but it's not old fashioned either.  It's timeless, and deserves tools which treat it as a first class concept, not a vestigial corner case.  Gemini isn't about innovation or disruption, it's about providing some respite for those who feel the internet has been disrupted enough already.  We're not out to change the world or destroy other technologies.  We are out to build a lightweight online space where documents are just documents, in the interests of every reader's privacy, attention and bandwidth.

Soft-unicast is the name given to our method of sharing IP addresses between machines. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-servers-dont-own-ips-anymore/"><u>You may learn about all the cool things we do with it</u></a>, but as far as a single machine is concerned, it has dozens to hundreds of combinations of IP address and source-port range, any of which may be chosen for use by outgoing connections.</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1NsU3FdxgJ0FNL78SDCo9D/65a27e8fd4339d3318a1b55b5979e3c6/image3.png" alt="" width="1400" height="720" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>The SNAT target in iptables supports a source-port range option to restrict the ports selected during NAT. In theory, we could continue to use iptables for this purpose, and to support multiple IP/port combinations we could use separate packet marks or multiple TUN devices. In actual deployment we would have to overcome challenges such as managing large numbers of iptables rules and possibly network devices, interference with other uses of packet marks, and deployment and reallocation of existing IP ranges.</p><p>Rather than increase the workload on our firewall, we wrote a single-purpose service dedicated to egressing IP packets on soft-unicast address space. For reasons lost in the mists of time, we named it SLATFATF, or “fish” for short. This service’s sole responsibility is to proxy IP packets using soft-unicast address space and manage the lease of those addresses.</p><p>WARP is not the only user of soft-unicast IP space in our network. Many Cloudflare products and services make use of the soft-unicast capability, and many of them use it in scenarios where we create a TCP socket in order to proxy or carry HTTP connections and other TCP-based protocols. Fish therefore needs to lease addresses that are not used by open sockets, and ensure that sockets cannot be opened to addresses leased by fish.</p><p>Our first attempt was to use distinct per-client addresses in fish and continue to let Netfilter/conntrack apply SNAT rules. However, we discovered an unfortunate interaction between Linux’s socket subsystem and the Netfilter conntrack module that reveals itself starkly when you use packet rewriting.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="collision-avoidance">Collision avoidance</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>Suppose we have a soft-unicast address slice, 198.51.100.10:9000-9009. Then, suppose we have two separate processes that want to bind a TCP socket at 198.51.100.10:9000 and connect it to 203.0.113.1:443. The first process can do this successfully, but the second process will receive an error when it attempts to connect, because there is already a socket matching the requested 5-tuple.</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2eXmHlyC0pdDUkZ9OI3JI/b83286088b4efa6ddee897e8b5d3b191/image8.png" alt="" width="1466" height="364" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>Instead of creating sockets, what happens when we emit packets on a TUN device with the same destination IP but a unique source IP, and use source NAT to rewrite those packets to an address in this range?</p><p>If we add an nftables “snat” rule that rewrites the source address to 198.51.100.10:9000-9009, Netfilter will create an entry in the conntrack table for each new connection seen on fishtun, mapping the new source address to the original one. If we try to forward more connections on that TUN device to the same destination IP, new source ports will be selected in the requested range, until all ten available ports have been allocated; once this happens, new connections will be dropped until an existing connection expires, freeing an entry in the conntrack table.</p><p>Unlike when binding a socket, Netfilter will simply pick the first free space in the conntrack table. However, if you use up all the possible entries in the table <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/conntrack-tales-one-thousand-and-one-flows/"><u>you will get an EPERM error when writing an IP packet</u></a>. Either way, whether you bind kernel sockets or you rewrite packets with conntrack, errors will indicate when there isn’t a free entry matching your requirements.</p><p>Now suppose that you combine the two approaches: a first process emits an IP packet on the TUN device that is rewritten to a packet on our soft-unicast port range. Then, a second process binds and connects a TCP socket with the same addresses as that IP packet:</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/57KuCP4vkp4TGPiLwDRPZv/c066279cd8a84a511f09ed5218488cec/image7.png" alt="" width="1720" height="780" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>The first problem is that there is no way for the second process to know that there is an active connection from 198.51.100.10:9000 to 203.0.113.1:443, at the time the <code>connect() </code>call is made. The second problem is that the connection is successful from the point of view of that second process.</p><p>It should not be possible for two connections to share the same 5-tuple. Indeed, they don’t. Instead, the source address of the TCP socket is <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.15/net/netfilter/nf_nat_core.c#L734"><u>silently rewritten to the next free port</u></a>.</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3DWpWJ5gBIDoEhimxIR8TT/fd3d8bd46353cd42ed09a527d4841da8/image6.png" alt="" width="1536" height="654" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>This behaviour is present even if you use conntrack without either SNAT or MASQUERADE rules. It usually happens that the lifetime of conntrack entries matches the lifetime of the sockets they’re related to, but this is not guaranteed, and you cannot depend on the source address of your socket matching the source address of the generated IP packets.</p><p>Crucially for soft-unicast, it means conntrack may rewrite our connection to have a source port outside of the port slice assigned to our machine. This will silently break the connection, causing unnecessary delays and false reports of connection timeouts. We need another solution.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="taking-a-breather">Taking a breather</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>For WARP, the solution we chose was to stop rewriting and forwarding IP packets, instead to terminate all TCP connections within the server and proxy them to a locally-created TCP socket with the correct soft-unicast address. This was an easy and viable solution that we already employed for a portion of our connections, such as those directed at the CDN, or intercepted as part of the Zero Trust Secure Web Gateway. However, it does introduce additional resource usage and potentially increased latency compared to the status quo. We wanted to find another way (to) forward.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="an-inefficient-interface">An inefficient interface</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>If you want to use both packet rewriting and bound sockets, you need to decide on a single source of truth. Netfilter is not aware of the socket subsystem, but most of the code that uses sockets and is also aware of soft-unicast is code that Cloudflare wrote and controls. A slightly younger version of myself therefore thought it made sense to change our code to work correctly in the face of Netfilter’s design.</p><p>Our first attempt was to use the Netlink interface to the conntrack module, to inspect and manipulate the connection tracking tables before sockets were created. <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/netlink/intro.html"><u>Netlink is an extensible interface to various Linux subsystems</u></a> and is used by many command-line tools like <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip.8.html"><u>ip</u></a> and, in our case, <a href="https://conntrack-tools.netfilter.org/manual.html"><u>conntrack-tools</u></a>. By creating the conntrack entry for the socket we are about to bind, we can guarantee that conntrack won’t rewrite the connection to an invalid port number, and ensure success every time. Likewise, if creating the entry fails, then we can try another valid address. This approach works regardless of whether we are binding a socket or forwarding IP packets.</p><p>There is one problem with this — it’s not terribly efficient. Netlink is slow compared to the bind/connect socket dance, and when creating conntrack entries you have to specify a timeout for the flow and delete the entry if your connection attempt fails, to ensure that the connection table doesn’t fill up too quickly for a given 5-tuple. In other words, you have to manually reimplement <a href="https://sysctl-explorer.net/net/ipv4/tcp_tw_reuse/"><u>tcp_tw_reuse</u></a> option to support high-traffic destinations with limited resources. In addition, a stray RST packet can erase your connection tracking entry. At our scale, anything like this that can happen, will happen. It is not a place for fragile solutions.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="socket-to-em">Socket to ‘em</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>Instead of creating conntrack entries, we can abuse kernel features for our own benefit. Some time ago Linux added <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/495304/"><u>the TCP_REPAIR socket option</u></a>, ostensibly to support connection migration between servers e.g. to relocate a VM. The scope of this feature allows you to create a new TCP socket and specify its entire connection state by hand.</p><p>An alternative use of this is to create a “connected” socket that never performed the TCP three-way handshake needed to establish that connection. At least, the kernel didn’t do that — if you are forwarding the IP packet containing a TCP SYN, you have more certainty about the expected state of the world.</p><p>However, the introduction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_Fast_Open"><u>TCP Fast Open</u></a> provides an even simpler way to do this: you can create a “connected” socket that doesn’t perform the traditional three-way handshake, on the assumption that the SYN packet — when sent with its initial payload — contains a valid cookie to immediately establish the connection. However, as nothing is sent until you write to the socket, this serves our needs perfectly.</p><p>You can try this yourself:</p>
            <pre><code>TCP_FASTOPEN_CONNECT = 30
TCP_FASTOPEN_NO_COOKIE = 34
s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
s.setsockopt(SOL_TCP, TCP_FASTOPEN_CONNECT, 1)
s.setsockopt(SOL_TCP, TCP_FASTOPEN_NO_COOKIE, 1)
s.bind(('198.51.100.10', 9000))
s.connect(('1.1.1.1', 53))</code></pre>
            <p>Binding a “connected” socket that nevertheless corresponds to no actual socket has one important feature: if other processes attempt to bind to the same addresses as the socket, they will fail to do so. This satisfies the problem we had at the beginning to make packet forwarding coexist with socket usage.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="jumping-the-queue">Jumping the queue</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>While this solves one problem, it creates another. By default, you can’t use an IP address for both locally-originated packets and forwarded packets.</p><p>For example, we assign the IP address 198.51.100.10 to a TUN device. This allows any program to create a TCP socket using the address 198.51.100.10:9000. We can also write packets to that TUN device with the address 198.51.100.10:9001, and Linux can be configured to forward those packets to a gateway, following the same route as the TCP socket. So far, so good.</p><p>On the inbound path, TCP packets addressed to 198.51.100.10:9000 will be accepted and data put into the TCP socket. TCP packets addressed to 198.51.100.10:9001, however, will be dropped. They are not forwarded to the TUN device at all.</p><p>Why is this the case? Local routing is special. If packets are received to a local address, they are treated as “input” and not forwarded, regardless of any routing you think should apply. Behold the default routing rules:</p><p><code>cbranch@linux:~$ ip rule
cbranch@linux:~$ ip rule
0:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from all lookup local
32766:&nbsp; &nbsp; from all lookup main
32767:&nbsp; &nbsp; from all lookup default</code></p><p>The rule priority is a nonnegative integer, the smallest priority value is evaluated first. This requires some slightly awkward rule manipulation to “insert” a lookup rule at the beginning that redirects marked packets to the packet forwarding service’s TUN device; you have to delete the existing rule, then create new rules in the right order. However, you don’t want to leave the routing rules without any route to the “local” table, in case you lose a packet while manipulating these rules. In the end, the result looks something like this:</p><p><code>ip rule add fwmark 42 table 100 priority 10
ip rule add lookup local priority 11
ip rule del priority 0
ip route add 0.0.0.0/0 proto static dev fishtun table 100</code></p><p>As with WARP, we simplify connection management by assigning a mark to packets coming from the “fishtun” interface, which we can use to route them back there. To prevent locally-originated TCP sockets from having this same mark applied, we assign the IP to the loopback interface instead of fishtun, leaving fishtun with no assigned address. But it doesn’t need one, as we have explicit routing rules now.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="uncharted-territory">Uncharted territory</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>While testing this last fix, I ran into an unfortunate problem. It did not work in our production environment.</p><p>It is not simple to debug the path of a packet through Linux’s networking stack. There are a few tools you can use, such as setting nftrace in nftables or applying the LOG/TRACE targets in iptables, which help you understand which rules and tables are applied for a given packet.</p>

          </figure><p><sup></sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Netfilter-packet-flow.svg"><sup><u>Schematic for the packet flow paths through Linux networking and *tables</u></sup></a><sup> by </sup><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jengelh"><sup>Jan Engelhardt</sup></a></p><p>Our expectation is that the packet will pass the prerouting hook, a routing decision is made to send the packet to our TUN device, then the packet will traverse the forward table. By tracing packets originating from the IP of a test host, we could see the packets enter the prerouting phase, but disappear after the ‘routing decision’ block.</p><p>While there is a block in the diagram for “socket lookup”, this occurs after processing the input table. Our packet doesn’t ever enter the input table; the only change we made was to create a local socket. If we stop creating the socket, the packet passes to the forward table as before.</p><p>It turns out that part of the ‘routing decision’ involves some protocol-specific processing. For IP packets, <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/89be9a83ccf1f88522317ce02f854f30d6115c41/net/ipv4/ip_input.c#L317"><u>routing decisions can be cached</u></a>, and some basic address validation is performed. In 2012, an additional feature was added: <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/20120619.163911.2094057156011157978.davem@davemloft.net/"><u>early demux</u></a>. The rationale being, at this point in packet processing we are already looking up something, and the majority of packets received are expected to be for local sockets, rather than an unknown packet or one that needs to be forwarded somewhere. In this case, why not look up the socket directly here and save yourself an extra route lookup?</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="the-workaround-at-the-end-of-the-universe">The workaround at the end of the universe</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>Unfortunately for us, we just created a socket and didn’t want it to receive packets. Our adjustment to the routing table is ignored, because that routing lookup is skipped entirely when the socket is found. Raw sockets avoid this by receiving all packets regardless of the routing decision, but the packet rate is too high for this to be efficient. The only way around this is disabling the early demux feature. According to the patch’s claims, though, this feature improves performance: how far will performance regress on our existing workloads if we disable it?</p><p>This calls for a simple experiment: set the <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/6.16/networking/ip-sysctl.html"><u>net.ipv4.tcp_early_demux</u></a> syscall to 0 on some machines in a datacenter, let it run for a while, then compare the CPU usage with machines using default settings and the same hardware configuration as the machines under test.</p>

          </figure><p>The key metrics are CPU usage from /proc/stat. If there is a performance degradation, we would expect to see higher CPU usage allocated to “softirq” — the context in which Linux network processing occurs — with little change to either userspace (top) or kernel time (bottom). The observed difference is slight, and mostly appears to reduce efficiency during off-peak hours.</p>

      <h2 id="swimming-upstream">Swimming upstream</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>While we tested different solutions to IP packet forwarding, we continued to terminate TCP connections on our network. Despite our initial concerns, the performance impact was small, and the benefits of increased visibility into origin reachability, fast internal routing within our network, and simpler observability of soft-unicast address usage flipped the burden of proof: was it worth trying to implement pure IP forwarding and supporting two different layers of egress?</p><p>So far, the answer is no. Fish runs on our network today, but with the much smaller responsibility of handling ICMP packets.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article class="page" lang="en">







<section id="pagebody" role="main">
<p>I wrote a few months ago about <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/google-killing-open-web/">the proxy war by Google against the open web by means of XSLT</a>.
Unsurprisingly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a> <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/deprecating-xslt" title="Deprecating and removing XSLT in the browser">has been moving forward on the deprecation</a>,
still without providing a solid justification on the reasons why other than
“we've been leeching off a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOSS">FLOSS</a> library for which we've finally found enough security bugs to use as an excuse”.
They do not explain why they haven't decided to fix the security issues in the library instead,
or adopt a more modern library written in a safe language, taking the opportunity to upgrade <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/XSLT/" rel="tag">XSLT</a> support
to a more recent, powerful and easier-to-use revision of the standard.</p>

<p>Instead, what they do is to provide a “polyfill”, a piece of <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/javascript/" rel="tag">JavaScript</a> that can allegedly used to supplant the functionality.
Curiously, however, they do <em>not</em> plan to ship such alternative in-browser,
which would allow a transparent transition without even a need to talk about XSLT <em>at all</em>.
No, they specifically refuse to do it, and instead are requesting anyone still relying on XSLT to
replace the invocation of the XSLT with a <em>non-standard</em> invocation of the JavaScript polyfill that should replace it.</p>

<p>This means that at least one of these two things are true:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the polyfill is not, in fact, sufficient to cover all the use cases previously covered by the built-in support for XSLT,
and insofar as it's not, they (Google) do not intend to invest resources in maintaining it,
meaning that the task is being dumped on web developers
(<abbr title="In Other Words">IOW</abbr>, Google is removing a feature that is going to create
<em>more work</em> for web developers just to provide the same functionality that they used to have from the browsers);</p></li>
<li><p>insofar as the polyfill is sufficient to replace the XSLT support in the browser,
the policy to not ship it as a replacement confirms that the security issues in the XSLT library used in Chrome
were nothing more than excuses to give the final blow to <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/rss/" rel="tag">RSS</a> and any other <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/XML/" rel="tag">XML</a> format
that is still the backbone of an independent web.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As I have mentioned <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/deprecating-xslt" title="DO NOT COMPLY.">in the Fediverse thread I wrote before this long-form article</a>,
there's an obvious parallel here with the events that I already mentioned
<a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/google-killing-open-web/">in my previous article</a>:
when <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/mozilla/" rel="tag">Mozilla</a> bent over to <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/google/" rel="tag">Google</a>'s pressure to kill off RSS by removing the “Live Bookmarks” features from the browser,
they did this on presumed technical grounds (citing as usual <a href="https://www.gijsk.com/blog/2018/10/firefox-removes-core-product-support-for-rss-atom-feeds/" title="Firefox removes core product support for RSS/Atom feeds">security and maintenance costs</a>,
but despite paid lip service to their importance for an open and interoperable web,
they didn't provide any official replacement for the functionality,
directing users instead to <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/feed-reader-replacements-firefox" title="Feed reader replacements for Firefox">a number of add-ons that provided similar functionality</a>,
<em>none of which are written or supported by Mozilla</em>.
Compare and contrast with their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket%20%28service%29">Pocket</a> integration that they force-installed everywhere
<a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/future-of-pocket" title="Pocket has shut down - What you need to know">before ultimately killing the service</a></p>

<p>Actions, as they say, speak louder than words.
When a company claims that a service or feature they are removing can be still accessed by other means,
but do not streamline such access said alternative,
and instead require their users to do the work necessary to access it,
you can rest assured that beyond any word of support they may coat their actions with
there is a plain and direct intent at sabotaging said feature,
and you can rest assured that any of the excuses brought forward to defend the choice
are nothing but lies to cover a vested interest in sabotaging the adoption of the service or feature:
the intent is for you to <em>not</em> use that feature at all, because they have a financial interest in you <em>not</em> using it.</p>

<p>And the best defense against that is to attack, and push the use of that feature even harder.</p>

<h2 id="do.not.comply."><a name="index1h2"></a>Do. Not. Comply.</h2>

<p>This is the gist of <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/deprecating-xslt" title="DO NOT COMPLY.">my Fediverse thread</a>.</p>

<p>
Do not install the polyfill.
Do not change your XML files to load it.
Instead, flood their issue tracker with requests to bring back in-browser XSLT support.
Report failed support for XSLT as a broken in browsers, because this is not a website issue.
</p>

<p><strong>I will not comply.</strong>
As I have for <em>years</em> continued using <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/mathml/" rel="tag">MathML</a>, <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/svg/" rel="tag">SVG</a> and <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/smil/" rel="tag">SMIL</a>
(sometimes <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/ars/halving-series/">even all together</a>) despite Google's intent on their deprecation,
I will keep using XSLT, and in fact will look for new opportunities to rely on it.
At most, I'll set up an infobox warning users reading my site about their browser's potential brokenness
and inability to follow standards, just like I've done for MathML and SMIL
(you can see such infoboxes in the page I linked above).
And just like ultimately I was proven right
(after several years, Google ended up fixing both their SMIL and their MathML support in Chrome),
my expectation is that, particularly with more of us pushing through,
the standards will once again prevail.</p>

<p>Remember: there is not technical justification for Google's choice.
This is not about a lone free software developer donating their free time to the community
and finding they do not have the mental or financial resources to provide a particular feature.
This is a trillion-dollar ad company who has been actively destroying the open web
for over a decade <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/773928/google-open-web-rapid-decline" title="Google admits the open web is in ‘rapid decline’">and finally admitting to it</a>
as a consequence of the <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr> push
and <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-men-who-killed-google/" title="The man who killed Google Search">intentional</a> [enshittification of web search]<a href="https://www.404media.co/google-search-really-has-gotten-worse-researchers-find/" title="Google Search Really Has Gotten Worse, Researchers Find">404mediaSearch</a>.</p>

<p>The deprecation of XSLT is entirely political,
fitting within the same grand scheme of the parasitic corporation killing the foundations of its own success
in an effort to grasp more and more control of it.
And the fact that the <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/webkit/" rel="tag">WebKit</a> team at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple%20Inc%2E">Apple</a>
and the <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/firefox/" rel="tag">Firefox</a> team at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla">Mozilla</a>
are intentioned to follow along on the same destructive path is not a counterpoint,
but rather an endorsement of the analysis,
as neither of those companies is interested in providing a <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/not-your-pc/">User Agent</a>
<span id="surveillance">as much as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surveillance%20capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a> tool that you happen to use.</span></p>

<p>(Hence why Mozilla, a company allegedly starved for resources,
is wasting them implementing <a href="https://flamedfury.com/posts/disable-ai-in-firefox/">LLM features nobody wants</a>
instead of <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=155730">fixing much-voted decade-old bugs with several duplicates</a>.
Notice how the bug pertains the (mis)treatment of XML-based formats —like RSS.)</p>

<p>If you have to spend any time at all to confront the Chrome push to deprecate XSLT,
your time is much better spent inventing better uses of XSLT
and reporting broken rendering if/when they start disabling it,
than caving to their destructive requests.</p>

<h2 id="thewhatwgisnotagoodstewardoftheopenweb"><a name="index2h2"></a>The WHATWG is not a good steward of the open web</h2>

<p>I've mentioned it <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/google-killing-open-web/">before</a>,
but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHATWG">WHATWG</a>, even assuming the best of intentions at the time it was founded,
is not a good steward of the open web.
It is more akin to the corrupt takeover you see in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regulatory%20capture">regulatory capture</a>,
except that instead of taking over the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C">W3C</a>
they just decided to get the ball and run with it,
taking advantage of the fact that, as implementors,
they had the final say on what counted as “standard”
(<em lang="lat">de facto</em> if not <em lang="lat">de jure</em>):
exactly the same attitude with which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> tried taking over the web
through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet%20Explorer">Internet Explorer</a> at the time of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First%20browser%20war">First browser war</a>,
an attitude that was rightly condemned at the time
—even as many of those who did, have so far failed to acknowledge the problem
with Google's no less detrimental approach.</p>

<p>The key point here is that,
whatever the <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/WHATWG/" rel="tag">WHATWG</a> was (or was intended to be)
when it was founded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera%20%28company%29">Opera</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla">Mozilla</a> developers,
it is now manifestly a corporate monster.
Their corporate stakeholder have a very different vision of what the Web should be
compared to the vision on which the Web was founded, the vision promoted by the <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/W3C/" rel="tag">W3C</a>,
and the vision that underlies a truly open and independent web.</p>

<p>The WHATWG aim is to turn the Web into an <em>application delivery platform</em>,
a profit-making machine for corporations where the computer
(and the browser through it)
are a means for <em>them</em> to make money off <em>you</em>
rather than for <em>you</em> to gain access to services you may be interested in.
Because of this, the browser in their vision is not a User Agent anymore,
but a tool that sacrifices privacy, actual security and user control
at the behest of the corporations “on the other side of the wire”
—and of their political interests
(refs. for <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/03/tim-cook-apple-donate-1-million-trump-inauguration" title="Scoop: Apple CEO Tim Cook donates $1 million to Trump inauguration">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/09/congress/google-donation-donald-trump-inauguration-00197233" title="Google gives $1 million to Trump inauguration">Google</a>,
and <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/ballroom-donors-white-house-trump" title="White House releases list of donors for Trump’s multi-million-dollar ballroom">a more recent list with all of them together</a>).</p>

<p>Such vision is in direct contrast with that of the Web as a
<em>repository of knowledge</em>, a vast vault of interconnected <em>documents</em>
whose value emerges from organic connections, personalization,
variety, curation and <em>user control</em>.
But who in the WHATWG today would defend such vision?</p>

<h2 id="anewbrowserwar"><a name="index3h2"></a>A new browser war?</h2>

<p>Maybe what we need is a new browser war.
Not one of corporation versus corporation
—doubly more so when all currently involved parties are allied
in their efforts to enclose the Web than in fostering an open and independent one—
but one of users versus corporations,
a war to take <em>back</em> control of the Web and its tools.</p>

<p>It's kind of ironic that in a time when <em>hosting</em> has become almost trivial,
the fight we're going to have to fight is going to be on the <em>client</em> side.
But the biggest question is: who do we have as champions on our side?</p>

<p>I would have liked to see browsers like <a href="https://vivaldi.net/">Vivaldi</a>,
the spiritual successor to <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/opera-requiem/">my beloved classic Opera browser</a>,
amongst our ranks,
but with their dependency on the <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/blink/" rel="tag">Blink</a> rendering engine, controlled by Google,
they won't be able to do anything but cave,
as will all other FLOSS browsers relying on Google's or Apple's engines,
none of which I foresee spending any significant efforts rolling back the extensive changes that these deprecations will involve.
(We see this already when it comes to JPEG&nbsp;XL support,
but it's also true that e.g. Vivaldi has made RSS feeds first-class documents,
so who knows, maybe they'll find a way for XSLT through the polyfill that was mentioned above,
or something like that?)</p>

<p>Who else is there?
There is <a href="https://servo.org/">Servo</a>, the rendering engine that was being developed at Mozilla to replace Gecko,
and that turned into an independent project when its team was fired <em lang="lat">en masse</em> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/mozilla-cutting-250-jobs-after-coronavirus-pandemic-cuts-revenue/">in 2020</a>;
but they don't support XSLT yet,
and I don't see why they would prioritize its implementation over, say, stuff like MathML or SVG animations with SMIL
(just to name two of my pet peeves), or optimizing browsing speed
(seriously, try opening <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/">the home page of this site</a> and scrolling through).</p>

<p>What we're left with at the moment is basically just Firefox forks,
and two of these (<a href="https://librewolf.net/">LibreWolf</a> and <a href="https://waterfox.net/">WaterFox</a>)
are basically just “Firefox without the most egregious privacy-invasive misfeatures”,
which leaves the question open about what they will be willing to do when Mozilla helps Google kill XSLT,
and only the other one, <a href="https://palemoon.org/">Pale&nbsp;Moon</a>, has grown into its own independent fork
(since such an old version of Firefox, in fact, that it doesn't support WebExtensions-based plugins,
such as the most recent versions of crucial plugins like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uBlock%20Origin">uBlock Origin</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy%20Badger">Privacy Badger</a>,
although it's possible to install community-supported forks of these plugins designed
for legacy versions of Firefox and forks like Pale&nbsp;Moon).</p>

<p>(Yes, I am aware that there are other minor independent browser projects,
like <a href="https://dillo-browser.github.io/">Dillo</a> and <a href="https://ladybird.org/">Ladybird</a>,
but the former is in no shape of being a serious contender for general use
on more sophisticated pages —just see it in action on this site, as always—
and the latter is not even in alpha phase,
just in case the questionable “no politics” policies
—which consistently prove to be weasel words for “we're right-wingers but too chicken to come out as such”—
weren't enough to stay away from it.)</p>

<p>Periodically, I go through them (the Firefox forks, that is) to check if they are good enough for me to become my daily drivers.
Just for you (not really: just for me, actually), I just tested them again.
They're not ready yet, at least not for me, although I must say that I'm seeing clear improvements since my last foray into the matter,
that wasn't even that long ago.
In some cases, I can attest that they are even better than Firefox:
for example, Pale&nbsp;Moon and WaterFox have good JPEG&nbsp;XL support
(including transparency and animation support,
which break in LibreWolf as they do in the latest nightly version of Firefox I tried),
and Pale&nbsp;Moon still has first-class support for RSS,
from address bar indicator to rendering even in the absence of a stylesheet
(be it CSS or XSLT).</p>

<p>(A suggestion? Look into more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/microformats">microformats</a> support.
An auxiliary bar with previous/<wbr>next/<wbr>up links on pages where this is relevant
would be a nice touch, for example.
<a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/opera-requiem-3/">It's one of those little details that really made classic Opera shine</a>.
EDIT: I <a href="https://pleroma.envs.net/objects/3bafa2dc-9621-4f13-a8f2-89fd000ba862">just found out</a>
that there's <a href="https://addons.palemoon.org/addon/website-navigation-bar/">a relevant addon</a> for Pale Moon!)</p>

<p>An interesting difference is that the user interface of these browsers is perceivably less refined than Firefox'.
It's a bit surprising, given the common roots,
but it emerges in several more and less apparent details,
from the spacing between menu items to overlapping text and icons in context menus,
passing through incomplete support for dark themes and other little details that all add up,
giving these otherwise quite valid browsers and amateurish feeling.</p>

<p>And I get it: UI design is hard, and I myself suck at it, so I'm the last person that should be giving recommendations,
but I'm still able to differentiate between more curated interfaces and ones that need some work;
and if even someone like me who distinctly prefers function over form finds these little details annoying,
I can imagine how much worse this may feel to users who care less about the former and more about the latter.
Sadly, if a new browser war is to be fought to wrestle control from the corporate-controlled WHATWG,
<em>this matters</em>.</p>

<p>In the end, I find myself in a “waiting” position.
How long will it take for Firefox to kill their XSLT support?
What will its closest forks
(WaterFox in particular is the one I'm eyeing)
be able to do about it?
Or will Pale&nbsp;Moon remain the only modern broser with support for it,
as a hard fork that has since long gone its own way?
Will they have matured enough to become my primary browsers?
We'll see in time.</p>

<h2 id="gemini"><a name="index4h2"></a>Another web?</h2>

<p>There's more to the Internet than the World Wide Web built around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">HTTP</a> protocol and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> file format.
There used to be <em>a lot</em> of the Internet beyond the Web,
and while much of it still remains as little more than a shadow of the past,
largely eclipsed by the Web and what has been built on top of it
(not all of it good) outside of some modest revivals,
there's also new parts of it that have tried to learn from the past,
and build towards something different.</p>

<p>This is the case for example of the so-called “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini%20%28protocol%29">Gemini</a> Space”,
a small corner of the Internet that has nothing to do with the LLM Google is trying to shove down everyone's throat,
and in fact not only predates it, <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/google-killing-open-web/">as I've mentioned already</a>,
but is intentionally built around dfferent technology to <em>stay away</em> from the influence of Google and the like.</p>

<p>The Gemini protocol is designed to be conceptually simpler than HTTP,
while providing modern features like built-in transport-level security
and certificate-based client-side authentication,
and its own “native” document format, the so-called <a href="https://geminiprotocol.net/docs/gemtext-specification.gmi" title="Gemini hypertext format, aka 'gemtext', specification">gemtext</a>.</p>

<p>As I said in <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/deprecating-xslt" title="DO NOT COMPLY.">my aforementioned Fediverse thread</a>:</p>

<p>
There's something to be said about not wanting to share your environment with the poison that a large part of the web has become,
but at the same time, there's also something to be said about throwing away the baby with the bathwater.
The problem with the web isn't technical, it's social. The tech itself is fine.
</p>

<p>I'm not going to write up an extensive criticism of the Gemini Space:
you can <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2023/05/28/the-gemini-protocol-seen-by-this-http-client-person/" title="The Gemini protocol seen by this HTTP client person">find here an older opinion</a> by the author of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl%20%28software%29"><code>curl</code></a>,
(although it should be kept in mind that things have changed quite a bit since:
for example, <a href="https://geminiprotocol.net/docs/" title="Gemini protocol documentation">the specification of the different components has been separated</a>,
as suggested by Daniel),
and <a href="https://aartaka.me/gmi-a11y.html" title="Gemtext Is Not Accessible">some criticism about how gemtext is used</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not going to sing the praises of the Gemini protocol or gemtext either,
even though I do like the idea of a web built on lightweight markup formats:
I would love it if browsers had native support for formats like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc">AsciiDoc</a> (and gemtext, for the matter):
it's why I keep the <a href="https://docs.asciidoctor.org/browser-extension/" title="Asciidoctor Browser Extension Documentation">AsciiDoctor Browser Extension</a> installed.</p>

<p>But more in general, the Web (or at least its user agents) should not differentiate.
It should not differentiate by protocol, and it should not differentiate by format.
We've seen it with image formats like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNG">MNG</a> being unfairly excluded,
with [motivations based on alleged code bloat][nomng] that today are manifest in their idiocy
(and yes, it hasn't escaped my that even Pale&nbsp;Moon doesn't support the format),
and we're seeing it today with JPEG&nbsp;XL threatened with a similar fate,
without even gracing us with a ridiculous excuse.
On the upside, we have browsers shipping with <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/">a full-fledged PDF reader</a>,
which is a good step towards the integration of this format with the greater Web.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, browsers would have not deprecated older protocols
like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher%20%28protocol%29">Gopher</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTP">FTP</a>,
and would just add support for new ones like Gemini,
as they would have introduced support for new (open) document formats as they came along.</p>

<p>(<a name="flash">Why insist on the <em>open</em> part?</a>
In <a href="https://mastodon.social/@whitequark/115509662529186486">another Fediverse thread about the XSLT deprecation</a>
I had an interesting discussion with the <abbr title="Original Poster">OP</abbr> about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWF">SWF</a>,
<em>the</em> interactive multimedia format for the Web at the turn of the century.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe%20Flash%20Player">Adobe Flash Player</a> ultimately fell out of favour,
arguably due to the advent of mobile Internet:
it has been argued that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash#End_of_life" title="Adobe Flash - End of life">the iPhone killed Flash</a>,
and while there's some well-deserved criticism of hypocrisy levelled against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve%20Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughts%20on%20Flash">Thoughts on Flash</a> letter,
it <em>is</em> true that what ultimatelly <em>truly</em> killed the format was it being proprietary and not fully documented.
And while we might not want to cry about the death of a proprietary format,
it remains true even today that the loss of even just legacy suport for it
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@whitequark/115512475517697743" title="flash was way more valuable to culture and art than xslt is ever going to be.">has been a significant loss to culture and art</a>,
as argued by <a href="https://mastodon.social/@whitequark">@whiteshark​@mastodon.social</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="awebofinterconnectedsoftware"><a name="index5h2"></a>A Web of interconnected software?</h2>

<p>It shouldn't be up to the User Agent to determine which formats the user is able to access, and through which protocol.
(If I had any artistic prowess (and willpower), I'd hack the “myth of consensual X” meme
representing the user and the server saying “I consent”, and the browser saying “I don't”.)
I do appreciate that there is a non-trivial maintenance cost that grows with the number of formats and protocols,
but <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/opera-requiem-2/">we know from classic Opera</a> that it is indeed quite possible
to <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/opera-requiem-3/">ship a full Internet suite</a> in a browser packaging.</p>

<p>In the old days, browser developers were well-aware that a single vendor couldn't “cover all bases”,
which is how interfaces like the once ubiquituous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPAPI">NPAPI</a> were born.
The plug-in interface has been since removed from most browsers,
an initiative <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/npapi-deprecation/" title="NPAPI deprecation: developer guide">again promoted by Google</a>, announced in 2013 and completed in 2015
(I should really add this to <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/google-killing-open-web/">my previous post on Google killing the open web</a>,
but I also really don't feel like touching that anymore; here will have to suffice),
with the other major browsers quickly following suit,
and its support is now relegated only to independent browsers like Pale&nbsp;Moon.</p>

<p>And even if it can be argued that the NPAPI specifically was indeed mired with unfixable security and portability issues and it had to go,
its removal without a clear cross-browser upgrade path has been <a name="pluginevolution">a significant loss for the evolution of the web</a>,
destroying the primary “escape hatch” to solve the chicken-and-egg problem of client-side format support versus server-side format adoption.
By the way, it was also responsible for the biggest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C">W3C</a> blunder,
the standardization of <abbr title="Digital Restriction Management">DRM</abbr> for the web through the so-called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encrypted%20Media%20Extensions">Encrypted Media Extensions</a>, a betrayal of the W3C own mission statement.</p>

<h3 id="theroleofmultimediastreaminginthedeathoftheuseragent"><a name="index1h3"></a>The role of multimedia streaming in the death of the User Agent</h3>

<p>The timeline here is quite interesting, and correlates with <a href="#flash">the already briefly mentioned history of Flash</a>,
and its short-lived <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft%20Silverlight">Microsoft Silverlight</a> competitor, that were largely responsible for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media#Business_developments">the early expansive growth of multimedia streaming services</a> in the early years of the XXI century:
with the tension between Apple's effort to kill Flash
and the need of emerging streaming services like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix">Netflix</a>' and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu">Hulu</a>'s
to support in-browser multimedia streaming,
there was a need to improve support for multimedia formats in the nascent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a> specification,
but also a requirement from the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/MAFIAA"><abbr title="Music And Film Industry Associations of America">MAFIAA</abbr></a> partners
that such a support would allow enforcing the necessary restrictions that would, among other things, prevent users from saving a local copy of the stream,
something that could be more easily enforced within the Flash players the industries had control over
than in a <em>User Agent</em> controlled by <em>the user</em>.</p>

<p>This is where the development of <abbr title="Encrypted Media Extensions">EME</abbr> came in in 2013:
this finally allowed a relatively quick phasing out of the Flash plugin,
and <em lang="lat">a posteriori</em> of the plugin interface that allowed its integration with the browsers:
by that time, the Flash plugin was by and large <em>the</em> plugin the API existed for,
and the plugin itself was indeed still supported by the browsers for some time after support for the API was otherwise discontinued
(sometimes through alternative interfaces such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPAPI">PPAPI</a>,
other times by keeping the NPAPI support around, but only enabled for the Flash plugin).</p>

<p>There are several interesting consideration that emerge from this little glimpse at the history of Flash and the EME.</p>

<p>First of all,
this is one more piece of history that goes to show how pivotal the year 2013 was for the enshittification of the World Wide Web,
<a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/google-killing-open-web/#2013">as discussed already</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly,
it shows how the developers of major browsers are more than willing to provide a smooth transition path with no user intervention,
at least when catering to the interests of major industries.
This indicates that when they don't, it's not because they <em>can't</em>:
it's because <em>they have a vested interest in not doing it</em>.
Major browser development is now (and has been for over a decade at least)
beholden not to the needs and wants of <em>their own users</em>,
but to those of other industries.
<a href="#surveillance">But I repeat myself</a>.</p>

<p>And thirdly, it's an excellent example, for the good and the bad, of how the plugin interface has helped drive the evolution of the web,
<a href="#pluginevolution">as I was saying</a>.</p>

<h3 id="controlledevolution"><a name="index2h3"></a>Controlled evolution</h3>

<p>The removal of NPAPI support,
followed a few years later by the removal of the (largely Chrome-specific) PPAPI interface
(that was supposed to be the “safer, more portable” evolution of NPAPI),
without providing <em>any</em> alternative,
is a very strong indication of the path that browser development has taken in the last “decade plus”:
a path where the Web is entirely controlled by what Google, Apple and Microsoft
(hey look, it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAFAM">GAFAM</a> all over again!) decide about what is allowed on it,
and what is <em>not</em> allowed to <em>not</em> be on it (to wit, ads and other user tracking implements).</p>

<p>In this perspective,
the transition from plugins to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/browser%20extensions">browser extensions</a> cannot be viewed (just) as a matter of security and portability,
but —more importantly, in fact— as a matter of crippled functionality:
indeed, extensions maintain <em>enough capabilities</em> to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension#Unwanted_behavior" title="Browser extension - Unwanted behavior">a vector of malware and adware</a>,
but <em>not enough</em> to circumvent unwanted browser behavior,
doubly more so with the so-called <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3" title="Extensions / Manifest V3">Extension Manifest V3</a>
specifically designed to thwart ad blocking
<a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/google-killing-open-web/#mv3">as I've already mentioned in the previous post of the series</a>.</p>

<p>With plugins, <em>anything</em> could be integrated in the World Wide Web,
and such integration would be close to as efficient as could be.
Without plugins, such integration, when possible at all,
becomes clumsier and more expensive.</p>

<p>As an example, there are browser extensions that can introduce support for JPEG&nbsp;XL to browsers that don't have native support.
This provides a workaround to display such images in said browsers,
but when a picture with multiple formats is offered
(which is what I do e.g. to provide a PNG fallback for the JXL images I provide),
this results in <em>both</em> the PNG <em>and</em> JXL formats being downloaded,
<em>increasing</em> the amount of data transferred instead of decreasing it
(one of the many benefits of JXL over PNG).
By contrast, a plugin could register itself a handler for the JPEG&nbsp;XL format,
and the browser would then be able to delegate rendering of the image to the plugin,
only falling back to the PNG in case of failure,
thus maximizing the usefulness of the format pending a built-in implementation.</p>

<p>The poster child of this lack of efficiency is arguably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathJax">MathJax</a>,
that has been carrying for nearly two decades the burden of bringing math to the web while browser implementors slacked off on their MathML support.
And while MathJax <em>does</em> offer more than just MathML support for browers without native implementations,
there is little doubt that it would be more effective in delivering the services it delivers
if it could be a plugin rather than a multi-megabyte
(any efforts to minimize its size notwithstanding)
JavaScript library each math-oriented website needs to load.</p>

<p>(In fact, it is somewhat surprising that there isn't a browser extesion version of MathJax that I can find
other than a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GreaseMonkey">GreaseMonkey</a> <a href="https://docs.mathjax.org/en/v1.0/dynamic.html#mathjax-and-greasemonkey" title="MathJax and GreaseMonkey">user script with convoluted usage requirements</a>,
but I guess this is the cost we have to pay for the library flexibility,
and the sandboxing requirements enforced on JavaScript in modern browsers.)</p>

<p>Since apparently “defensive writing” is a thing we need when jotting down an article such as this
(as if it even matters, given how little attention people give to what they read —if they read it at all— before commenting),
I should clarify that I'm not necessarily for a return to NPAPI advocating.
We have decades of experience about what could be considered the actual technical issues with that interface,
and how they can be improved upon
(which is for example what PPAPI allegedly did,
before Google decided it would be better off to kill plugins entirely
and thus gain full control of the Web as a platform),
as we do about sandboxing external code running in browsers
(largely through the efforts to sandbox JavaScript).
A better plugin API could be designed.</p>

<p>It's not going to happen.
It is now apparent that the major browsers explicitly and intentionally do not want to allow the kind of flexibility that plugins would allow,
hiding their controlling efforts behind security excuses.
It would thus be up to the minority browsers to come up with such an interface
(or actually multiple ones, at least one for protocols and one for document types),
but with most of them beholden to the rendering engines controlled by Google
(for the most part), Apple (some, still using WebKit over Blink), and Mozilla (the few Firefox forks),
they are left with very little leeway, if any at all, in terms of what they can support.</p>

<p>But even if, by some miraculous convergence, they did manage to agree on and implement support for such an API,
would there actually be an interest by third party to develop plugins for it?
I can envision this as a way for browsers to share coding efforts in supporting new protocols and formats before integrating them as first-class
(for example, the <a href="#gemini">already mentioned</a> Gemini protocol and gemtext format could be implemented first as a plugin
to the benefit of any browsers supporting such hypothetical interfaces)
but there be any interest in developing for it, rather tha just trying to get the feature implemented in the browsers themselves?</p>

<h3 id="ameshofbuildingblocks"><a name="index3h3"></a>A mesh of building blocks</h3>

<p>Still, let me dream a bit of something like this,
a browser made up of composable components,
protocol handlers separate from primary document renderers separate from attachment handlers.</p>

<dl>
<dt>A new protocol comes out?</dt>
<dd>Implement a plugin to handle that, and you can test it by delivering the same content over it,
and see it rendered just the same from the other components in the chain.</dd>
<dt>A new document format comes out?</dt>
<dd>Implement a plugin to handle that, and it will be used to render documents in the new format.</dd>
<dt>A new image format comes out?</dt>
<dd>Implement a plugin to handle that, and any image in the new format will be visible.</dd>
<dt>A new scripting language comes out?</dt>
<dd>You guessed it: implement a plugin to handle that&nbsp;…</dd>
</dl>

<p>How much tech would have had a real chance at proving itself in the field if this had been the case,
or would have survived being ousted not by technical limitations,
but by unfriendly corporate control?
Who knows, maybe
RSS and Atom integration would still be trivially at everybody's hand;
nobody would have had to fight with the long-standing bugs in PNG rendering from Internet Explorer,
MNG would have flourished, JPEG&nbsp;XL would have become ubiquituous six months after the specification had been finalized;
we would have seen HTML+SMIL provide declarative interactive documents without JavaScript as far back as 2008;
XSLT 2 and 3 would have long superseded XSLT 1 as <em>the</em> templating languages for the web,
or XSLT would have been supplanted by the considerably more accessible XQuery;
XHTML2 would have lived and grown alongside HTML5,
offering more sensible markup for many common features,
and much-wanted capabilities such as client-side includes.</p>

<p>The web would have been very different from what it is today,
and most importantly we would never would have had to worry
about a single corporation getting to dictate what is and what isn't allowed on the Web.</p>

<p>But the reality is much harsher and darker.
Google has control, and we do need to wrestle it out of their hands.</p>

<h2 id="resist"><a name="index6h2"></a>Resist</h2>

<p>So, do not comply.<br>
Resist.<br>
Force the unwanted tech through.<br>
Use RSS.<br>
Use XSLT.<br>
Adopt JPEG&nbsp;XL as your primary image format.<br>
And report newly broken sites for what they are:<br>
a browser fault, not a content issue.</p>

<h2 id="postscriptum"><a name="index7h2"></a>Post scriptum</h2>

<p>I would like to add here any <em lang="fr">pièces de résistance</em> for XSLT.</p>

<p>I'm going to inaugurate with a link <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2025/11/xslt-rip/">I've just discovered</a> thanks to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JWZ">JWZ</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://xslt.rip/">xslt.rip</a> (best viewed with a browser that supports XSLT; viewing the source is highly recommended);</p></li>
<li><p>and last but not least (yeah I know, doesn't make much sense with the current short list, but still),
a shameless plug of <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/">my own website</a>, of course,
because of the idea to use XSLT not to produce HTML, but to produce SVG.</p></li>

<p dir="auto"><strong>This project currently does NOT use Machine Learning models.</strong> Instead, it employs a <strong>mathematical approach</strong> that extracts <strong>10 features</strong> from CSI (Channel State Information) data using statistical and signal processing techniques.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Key Points</h3><a id="user-content-key-points" aria-label="Permalink: Key Points" href="#key-points"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>✅ <strong>No ML training required</strong>: Works out-of-the-box with mathematical algorithms</li>
<li>✅ <strong>10 extracted features</strong>: Statistical, spatial, and temporal features</li>
<li>✅ <strong>Real-time processing</strong>: Low latency detection on ESP32-S3 hardware</li>
<li>✅ <strong>Foundation for ML</strong>: These features can serve as the basis for collecting labeled datasets to train ML models for advanced tasks (people counting, activity recognition, gesture detection)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The mathematical approach provides excellent movement detection without the complexity of ML model training, while the extracted features offer a solid foundation for future ML-based enhancements.</p>

<p dir="auto">When someone moves in a room, they "disturb" the Wi-Fi waves traveling between the router and the sensor. It's like when you move your hand in front of a flashlight and see the shadow change.</p>
<p dir="auto">The ESP32-S3 device "listens" to these changes and understands if there's movement.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Channel State Information (CSI)</strong> represents the physical characteristics of the wireless communication channel between transmitter and receiver. Unlike simple RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator), CSI provides rich, multi-dimensional data about the radio channel.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What CSI Captures</h4><a id="user-content-what-csi-captures" aria-label="Permalink: What CSI Captures" href="#what-csi-captures"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Per-subcarrier information:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Amplitude</strong>: Signal strength for each OFDM subcarrier (up to 64)</li>
<li><strong>Phase</strong>: Phase shift of each subcarrier</li>
<li><strong>Frequency response</strong>: How the channel affects different frequencies</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Environmental effects:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Multipath propagation</strong>: Reflections from walls, furniture, objects</li>
<li><strong>Doppler shifts</strong>: Changes caused by movement</li>
<li><strong>Temporal variations</strong>: How the channel evolves over time</li>
<li><strong>Spatial patterns</strong>: Signal distribution across antennas/subcarriers</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why It Works for Movement Detection</h4><a id="user-content-why-it-works-for-movement-detection" aria-label="Permalink: Why It Works for Movement Detection" href="#why-it-works-for-movement-detection"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When a person moves in an environment, they:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Alter multipath reflections (new signal paths)</li>
<li>Change signal amplitude and phase</li>
<li>Create temporal variations in CSI patterns</li>
<li>Modify the electromagnetic field structure</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">These changes are detectable even through walls, enabling <strong>privacy-preserving presence detection</strong> without cameras, microphones, or wearable devices.</p>

<p dir="auto">✅ <strong>Position sensor in the area to monitor</strong> (not necessarily in direct line with router)<br>
✅ <strong>Height: 1-1.5 meters</strong> from ground (desk/table height)<br>
✅ <strong>External antenna</strong>: Use IPEX connector for better reception<br>
❌ <strong>Avoid metal obstacles</strong> between router and sensor (refrigerators, metal cabinets)<br>
❌ <strong>Avoid corners</strong> or enclosed spaces (reduces multipath diversity)</p>

<details>
<summary>Click to expand FAQ</summary>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q: Do I need programming knowledge to use it?</strong><br>
A: Basic command line skills are needed to build and flash the firmware using ESP-IDF. Follow the step-by-step guide in SETUP.md.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q: Does it work with my router?</strong><br>
A: Yes, if your router has 2.4GHz Wi-Fi (virtually all modern routers have it).</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q: How much does it cost in total?</strong><br>
A: Hardware: ~€10 for the ESP32-S3 device. Software: All free and open source. You'll also need a device to run the MQTT broker (Home Assistant or Mosquitto), which can be a Raspberry Pi (~€35-50) or any existing PC/NAS you already have (free).</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q: Do I need to modify anything on the router?</strong><br>
A: No! The router works normally. The sensor "listens" to Wi-Fi signals without modifying anything.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q: Can I try it without Home Assistant?</strong><br>
A: Yes, you can use any MQTT server (e.g., Mosquitto) or even just view data via serial port.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q: Does it work through walls?</strong><br>
A: Yes, the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi signal penetrates drywall. Reinforced concrete walls reduce sensitivity but detection remains possible at reduced distances.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q: How many sensors are needed for a house?</strong><br>
A: It depends on size. One sensor can monitor ~50 m². For larger homes, use multiple sensors (1 sensor every 50-70 m² for optimal coverage).</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q: Can it distinguish between people and pets?</strong><br>
A: The system uses a 2-state segmentation model (IDLE/MOTION) that identifies generic movement without distinguishing between people, pets, or other moving objects. For more sophisticated classification (people vs pets, activity recognition, gesture detection), trained AI/ML models would be required (see Future Evolutions section).</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q: Does it consume a lot of Wi-Fi bandwidth?</strong><br>
A: No, MQTT traffic is minimal. With smart publishing disabled (default), the system publishes all detection updates. When smart publishing is enabled, the system only sends data on significant changes or every 5 seconds as a heartbeat, resulting in ~0.2-0.5 KB/s per sensor during idle periods and up to ~1 KB/s during active movement. Network impact is negligible.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q: Does it work with mesh Wi-Fi networks?</strong><br>
A: Yes, it works normally. Make sure the ESP32 connects to the 2.4 GHz band.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q: Is a dedicated server necessary?</strong><br>
A: No, Home Assistant can run on Raspberry Pi, NAS, or cloud. Alternatively, just an MQTT broker (Mosquitto) on any device is sufficient.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q: How accurate is the detection?</strong><br>
A: Detection accuracy is highly environment-dependent and requires proper tuning. Factors affecting performance include: room layout, wall materials, furniture placement, distance from router (optimal: 3-8m), and interference levels. In optimal conditions with proper tuning, the system provides reliable movement detection. Adjust the <code>segmentation_threshold</code> parameter to tune sensitivity for your specific environment.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q: What's the power consumption?</strong><br>
A: ~500mW typical during continuous operation. The firmware includes support for power optimization, and deep sleep modes can be implemented for battery-powered deployments, though this would require custom modifications to the code.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q: If it doesn't work, can I get help?</strong><br>
A: Yes, open an <a href="https://github.com/francescopace/espectre/issues">Issue on GitHub</a> or contact me via email.</p>

<summary>🛜 Standardized Wi-Fi Sensing (IEEE 802.11bf) (click to expand)</summary>
<p dir="auto">Currently, only a limited number of Wi-Fi chipsets support CSI extraction, which restricts hardware options for Wi-Fi sensing applications. However, the <strong>IEEE 802.11bf (Wi-Fi Sensing)</strong> standard should significantly improve this situation by making CSI extraction a standardized feature.</p>

<p>Big news: We’re joining Cloudflare.</p>
<p>Replicate’s going to carry on as a distinct brand, and all that’ll happen is that it’s going to get way better. It’ll be faster, we’ll have more resources, and it’ll integrate with the rest of Cloudflare’s Developer Platform.</p>
<p>The API isn’t changing. The models you’re using today will keep working. If you’ve built something on Replicate, it’ll keep running just like it does now.</p>
<p>So, why are we doing this?</p>
<p>At Replicate, we’re building the primitives for AI: the tools and abstractions that let software developers use AI without having to understand all the complex stuff underneath.</p>
<p>We started with <a href="https://github.com/replicate/cog">Cog</a>, an open-source tool which defines a standard format for what a model is. Then, we created Replicate, a platform where people can share models and run them with an API. We’ve defined what a model is, how you publish it, how you run it, how you get data in and out.</p>
<p>These abstractions are like the low-level primitives of an operating system. But what’s interesting is that these primitives are running in the cloud. They have to — they need specialized GPUs and clusters to scale up in production. It’s like a distributed operating system for AI, running in the cloud. In other words, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-network-is-the-computer/">the network is the computer</a>.</p>
<p>Who has the best network? Cloudflare.</p>
<p>Cloudflare has built so many other parts of this operating system. Workers is the perfect platform for running agents and glue code. Durable Objects for managing state, R2 for storing files, WebRTC for streaming media.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve got these low-level abstractions, we can build higher-level abstractions. Ways to orchestrate models and build agents. Ways to run real-time models, or run models on the edge.</p>
<p>This is why we’re joining Cloudflare.</p>
<p>For my whole career, I’ve looked up to Cloudflare. How they built a product for developers, and turned that into a huge enterprise business. It’s the only public company that actually <em>gets</em> developers and knows how to build good products for them.</p>
<p>Cloudflare is the default for building web apps. From day one of Replicate, when we were building a prototype to apply to Y Combinator, we put Cloudflare in front of it.</p>
<p>Together, we’re going to become the default for building AI apps.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>When I arrived in Reykjavík, Iceland, last March, a gravel barrier, almost thirty feet at its highest point, had been constructed to keep lava from the Reykjanes volcano from inundating a major geothermal power station not far from downtown. So far, it had worked, but daily volcano forecasts were being broadcast on a small television at the domestic airport where I was waiting to take a short flight to Akureyri, a town on the north coast about an hour’s drive from one of the country’s oldest geothermal plants, the Krafla Geothermal Station. Until the early nineteen-seventies, Iceland relied on imported fossil fuels for nearly three-quarters of its energy. The resources of the country—a landscape of hot springs, lava domes, and bubbling mud pots—were largely untapped. “In the past, people here in the valley lacked most things now considered essential to human life, except for a hundred thousand million tons of boiling-hot water,” the Icelandic Nobelist Halldór Laxness wrote in “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Parish-Chronicle-Halld%C3%B3r-Laxness/dp/1962770516" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://cna.st/affiliate-link/NNEw2ziszMQLBwHM6VfyE1uSXcHeP7CrariBUQhXSAtqgzZd6RNxJBNQYXcWjNhobftYTFXBPRyF4y78SvL3rUinUrbEm7hDmV8AA9LyuxbdrZYpXUdqJvP3ZzZfCugzSiVJ1HxsqEoUrvo5XwUM6pjaiPsLz5jwsHSvH6jdcgfpmZpVKN1SfoyztkrynxUMb7tiLNfN8mhD9giuCpoRguxKiE4n4pgVG2CCfLkaU5brL6uEwRJS9fLCZhrph4bHAj9JMkG6KNT49UmZApMPkmCrN4cuc9X7KXk4LufdW4fK8ucYKfcbnZ4GKPkz59byK7TUxAxuqHzb9sWKMPK5zPKYLuHQfb46C4RnormEBkqeJC4srRHf5EHzpNtrXZmWsnGqsVbmPbAiQxZLvqUh4H4q1ziqvdn&quot;}" href="https://cna.st/affiliate-link/NNEw2ziszMQLBwHM6VfyE1uSXcHeP7CrariBUQhXSAtqgzZd6RNxJBNQYXcWjNhobftYTFXBPRyF4y78SvL3rUinUrbEm7hDmV8AA9LyuxbdrZYpXUdqJvP3ZzZfCugzSiVJ1HxsqEoUrvo5XwUM6pjaiPsLz5jwsHSvH6jdcgfpmZpVKN1SfoyztkrynxUMb7tiLNfN8mhD9giuCpoRguxKiE4n4pgVG2CCfLkaU5brL6uEwRJS9fLCZhrph4bHAj9JMkG6KNT49UmZApMPkmCrN4cuc9X7KXk4LufdW4fK8ucYKfcbnZ4GKPkz59byK7TUxAxuqHzb9sWKMPK5zPKYLuHQfb46C4RnormEBkqeJC4srRHf5EHzpNtrXZmWsnGqsVbmPbAiQxZLvqUh4H4q1ziqvdn" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="1962770516" data-aps-asc-tag="">A Parish Chronicle</a>,” his 1970 novel. “For a hundred thousand years this water, more valuable than all coal mines, ran in torrents out to sea.” The oil crisis of 1973, when prices more than tripled, proved a useful emergency. Among other efforts to develop local energy, public-investment funds provided loans for geothermal projects, whose upfront costs were considerable. By the early eighties, almost all the country’s homes were heated geothermally; in Reykjavík, a subterranean geothermal-powered system is in place to melt snow and ice off sidewalks and roads. Today, more than a quarter of the country’s electricity comes from geothermal sources, a higher proportion than in almost any other nation. Most of the rest is from hydropower.</p><p>In some ways, the process of harnessing geothermal energy is simple. The deeper you dig, the hotter the temperatures get. For direct heating, you dig relatively shallow wells (typically several hundred metres deep), to access natural reservoirs of hot water or steam, which can be piped into a structure. For electricity, wells are dug farther down, to where temperatures are above a hundred and fifty degrees Celsius. (In Iceland, this temperature is reached at around one thousand to two thousand metres deep.) Pressurized steam spins a turbine that in turn spins a generator. Thermal energy (steam) is translated into mechanical energy (the spinning turbine), which is translated into electrical energy (via the generator). Geothermal energy is essentially carbon-free, it is available at any time of day and in any weather, and it leaves a small—albeit very deep—footprint on the landscape.</p><p>In 2008, Iceland’s three largest energy companies collaborated on a research project to drill down even farther, at a site near Krafla, for steam that was even hotter, some four hundred degrees Celsius. Such “supercritical” steam is water that is so hot and pressurized that it has passed into a fourth state, beyond gas. The hotter a well the better, typically: it will produce more energy more efficiently. The Iceland Deep Drilling Project (I.D.D.P.) engineers had planned to dig down some four kilometres—but their drill got stuck at around two kilometres. Bits of black glass shot up from the well. After some disbelief, the team concluded that they had hit magma. This oops-ing into magma was at first received as “very bad news,” Bjarni Palsson, a chief project manager on the I.D.D.P. and now an executive vice-president of the energy company Landsvirkjun, told me. Many people thought that drilling into magma might trigger a volcanic eruption. “Then we started to see: What actually do we have here?” Palsson said. They put a wellhead on their work to measure the flow rates of steam. “What happened next was remarkable,” Palsson continued. The magma was about nine hundred degrees Celsius. The steam flow was such that it could produce ten times more energy than a regular well. They had created the hottest and most powerful geothermal well in the world.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>There was no security check before boarding the plane. I was told by one of my companions, Hilmar Már Einarsson, a youthful project manager with Landsvirkjun, that people sometimes stowed their hunting rifles in the overhead luggage compartments. On the drive from Akureyri to Krafla, we passed Lake Mývatn, home to a kind of arctic char that lives only there. We also passed Icelandic horses, a diminutive breed famed for its distinctive gaits: in addition to walking, trotting, and galloping, it has a “flying pace” and a rhythmic four-beat gait known as <em>tölt</em>. Amid the expansive greens and yellows of northeast Iceland, we arrived at the Krafla Geothermal Station, where steam has been spinning two Mitsubishi turbines continuously for decades.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The station provides power to commercial buildings and heating to homes in the district. A rust-red building in the shape of a giant barn stood across from silvery cooling towers capped by cloud-white steam. Construction began in 1974 but took four years to finish, working around the Krafla fires, a series of volcanic eruptions that went on for years. (In Icelandic folklore, the region is where the Devil landed after being expelled from Heaven.) Around the station is a volcanic valley of green vegetation and basalt rock, with patches of snow. The wellhouses appeared as igloo-size aluminum geodesic domes; like the main power station, they were rust red. Einarsson opened one for me. Visible within was a thick horizontal pipe joined to a vertical one, with what looked like a ship’s steering wheel attached. Not visible was the well itself, which extended belowground like a long metal straw. (Krafla’s geothermal wells are about seven inches across, notably narrower than many oil and gas wells.) “Some wells last twenty years, some last two—you can’t know for certain,” Einarsson explained. The temperature and permeability of the rock, as well as the amount of fluid flowing across it, affect a well’s performance. Also, Iceland has myths about “hidden people”—<em>huldufólk</em>. It is said that building on their land brings bad luck, so there’s that, too.</p><p>We stopped by the station’s canteen, taking our shoes off before entering. Lunch had ended, but there was homemade apple cake, dried apricots, and skyr available. Workmen in neon-yellow suits, who had traded their boots for slippers, were having tea. Einarsson then took me to the I.D.D.P. site, not far from the Krafla plant, where a sign marked a snow-covered depression about the size of a modest pond. Compared with the turbines and steam towers and the idyllic orderliness of the canteen, the site was underwhelming. Two years after the well was dug, the extreme pressure and heat began to corrode the metal casing of the well itself. Black smoke poured out each time the well was reopened. Soon, it had to be shut down permanently. In 2017, another research well, I.D.D.P.-2, was drilled down four and a half kilometres, where temperatures reached at least four hundred and twenty-six degrees Celsius—but this time the well failed after only six months. “One thing we learned is that you don’t open and close and open and close the well—you just leave it open,” Palsson had told me, explaining that such actions made the well more brittle.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Landsvirkjun, which had paid for most of the I.D.D.P. work, decided that it needed financial support to drill more exploratory wells. “We said, ‘We’re just a small energy company in Iceland,’&nbsp;” Palsson told me. But it made its research available to the international scientific community, and there has been intermittent interest from the U.K., Germany, Canada, and New Zealand. “That’s where we are now, trying to fund it as a science project that can also benefit the energy industry,” Palsson said.</p><p>Driving back to the airport, we saw snow ptarmigans and cairns of black stones marking trails that stretched beyond view. Iceland’s transition into a country powered nearly completely by renewables can seem fantastical, and the landscape furthers this impression. Because Iceland is singular in so many ways—that lonely arctic-char species! those small horses with their <em>tölt!</em>—you can get the feeling that geothermal energy is a niche endeavor, as opposed to one that is technically and economically feasible in places where volcanic eruptions aren’t part of the daily forecast. But that feeling is outdated and misleading.</p><p>Geothermal is underdeveloped, and its upfront costs can be high, but it’s always on and, once it’s set up, it is cheap and enduring. The dream of geothermal energy is to meet humanity’s energy demands affordably, without harnessing horses for horsepower, slaughtering whales for their oil, or burning fossil fuels. The planet’s heat could be used to pasteurize milk or heat dorm rooms or light up a baseball stadium for a night game.</p><p>At more than five thousand degrees Celsius, the Earth’s core is roughly as hot as the surface of the sun. At the Earth’s surface, the temperature is about fourteen degrees. But in some places, like Iceland, the ground underfoot is much warmer. Hot springs, geysers, and volcanoes are surface-level signs of the Earth’s inferno. Dante’s description of Hell is said by some to have been inspired by the landscape of sulfurous steam plumes found in Devil’s Valley in Tuscany.</p><p>Snow monkeys and humans have been using Earth-heated waters as baths for ages. In the Azores, a local dish, <em>cozido de las furnas</em>, is cooked by burying a clay pot in hot volcanic soil; in Iceland, bread is still sometimes baked this way. The first geothermal power generator was built in Devil’s Valley, in 1904, by Prince Piero Ginori Conti of Trevignano, who had been extracting borax from the area and thought to make use of the steam emerging from the mining borehole. The generator initially powered five light bulbs. Not long afterward, it powered central Italy’s railway system and a few villages. The geothermal complex is still in operation today, providing one to two per cent of Italy’s energy. In the United States, the first geothermal plant was built in 1921, in Northern California, in a geyser-filled area that a surveyor described as the gates of Hell. That plant powered a nearby resort hotel and is also still in use.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a24382&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a24382" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture><img alt="Elderly man finally gives his female partner time to speak about herself." loading="lazy" srcset="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/6913865c07e05393286d228a/master/w_120,c_limit/a24382.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/6913865c07e05393286d228a/master/w_240,c_limit/a24382.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/6913865c07e05393286d228a/master/w_320,c_limit/a24382.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/6913865c07e05393286d228a/master/w_640,c_limit/a24382.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/6913865c07e05393286d228a/master/w_960,c_limit/a24382.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/6913865c07e05393286d228a/master/w_1280,c_limit/a24382.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/6913865c07e05393286d228a/master/w_1600,c_limit/a24382.jpg 1600w" sizes="100vw" src="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/6913865c07e05393286d228a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/a24382.jpg"></picture></a><p><span>“So, anyway, tell me something about yourself.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Avi Steinberg</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>There aren’t gates of Hell just anywhere. A kilometre below ground in Kamchatka is considerably hotter than a kilometre below ground in Kansas. There is also readily accessible geothermal energy in Kenya (where it provides almost fifty per cent of the country’s energy), New Zealand (about twenty per cent), and the Philippines (about fifteen per cent)—all volcanic areas along tectonic rifts. But in less Hadean landscapes the costs and uncertainties of drilling deep in search of sufficient heat have curtailed development. This partly explains why, in the field of clean energy, geothermal is often either not on the list or mentioned under the rubric of “other.” For decades, both private and government investment in geothermal energy was all but negligible.</p><p>That has now changed. In the past five years, in North America, more than a billion and a half dollars have gone into geothermal technologies. This is a small amount for the energy industry, but it’s also an exponential increase. In May, 2021, Google signed a contract with the Texas-based geothermal company Fervo to power its data centers and infrastructure in Nevada; Meta signed a similar deal with Texas-based Sage for a data center east of the Rocky Mountains, and with a company called XGS for one in New Mexico. Microsoft is co-developing a billion-dollar geothermal-powered data center in Kenya; Amazon installed geothermal heating at its newly built fulfillment center in Japan. (Geothermal energy enables companies to avoid the uncertainties of the electrical grid.) Under the Biden Administration, the geothermal industry finally received the same kind of tax credits given to wind and solar, and under the current Trump Administration it has received the same kind of fast-track permitting given to oil and gas. Donald Trump’s Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, spoke at a geothermal conference and declared, in front of a <em>MAGA</em>-like sign that read “<em>MAGMA</em> (Making America Geothermal: Modern Advances),” that although geothermal hasn’t achieved “liftoff yet, it should and it can.” Depending on whom you speak with, either it’s weird that suddenly everyone is talking about geothermal or it’s weird that there is a cost-competitive energy source with bipartisan appeal that no one is talking about.</p><p>Scientific work that has been discarded or forgotten can return—sometimes through unknowing repetition, at other times through deliberate recovery. In the early nineteen-seventies, the U.S. government funded a program at Los Alamos that looked into developing geothermal energy systems that didn’t require proximity to geysers or volcanoes. Two connected wells were built: in one, water was sent down into fractured hot, dry rock; from the other, the steam that resulted from the water meeting the rock emerged. In 1973, Richard Nixon announced Project Independence, which aimed to develop energy sources outside of fossil fuels. “But when Reagan came into office, he changed things,” Jefferson Tester, a professor of sustainable energy systems at Cornell University, who was involved in the Los Alamos project, told me. The price of oil had come down, and support for geothermal dissipated. “People got this impression that it was a failure,” Tester said. “I think if they looked a little closer, they would see that a lot of the knowledge gained in those first years could have been used to leverage what is happening now.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Tester went on to help establish the M.I.T. Energy Lab (now called the Energy Initiative), which focusses on advancing clean-energy solutions. He and his colleagues felt that students needed to know the history of the research into diverse energy sources, so they put together a course and a textbook called “Sustainable Energy: Choosing Among Options.” In 2005, the Department of Energy, under George&nbsp;W. Bush, commissioned a group consisting of Tester and some seventeen other experts and researchers—including drilling engineers, energy economists, and power-plant builders—to investigate what it would take for the U.S. to produce a hundred thousand megawatts of geothermal energy, a bit more than one-fifth of the energy the U.S. had consumed that year. (Geothermal energy production in the U.S. at that time was around three or four thousand megawatts.) The experts avoided framing their support for geothermal in environmental terms. “The feeling was that you weren’t supposed to talk about carbon, because then it would be perceived as about climate change,” Tester said.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In 2006, Tester and his colleagues published their report, “The Future of Geothermal Energy.” One finding was that new drilling technology employed by the oil-and-gas industry was changing the economics of geothermal power generation. Latent ideas—like those from the Los Alamos project—had met their moment. “I was called to testify a few times before Congress. It was a relatively modest investment that was needed, and people were excited,” Tester told me. “But then we submitted the report to the Department of Energy. And they did nothing. It was crazy.” He was still visibly dismayed.</p><p>One explanation for the lack of action is that, around that time, the U.S. went from being an oil importer to an oil exporter. This turnaround was largely due to the innovations of George Mitchell, a second-generation Greek American in Galveston, Texas, who spent years trying to extract oil and gas from the Barnett Shale formation, in North Texas, in an economically viable way. His approach synthesized hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, with horizontal drilling. Fracking involves injecting fluid down a well at high pressures, which cracks the subsurface, and the horizontal drilling augments the area of cracking. Eventually, Mitchell’s company, helped by generous tax incentives, made the economics work. Vast oil reserves became accessible. Fortunes were made. Fracking overwhelmed the renewed interest in geothermal power. But a couple of decades later there was a reversal: fracking accelerated geothermal power.</p><p>Tim Latimer, the thirty-five-year-old C.E.O. of Fervo Energy, a geothermal company founded in 2017, grew up in Riesel, Texas, a small town about fifteen miles outside Waco. After graduating from the University of Tulsa with a degree in mechanical engineering, Latimer wanted a well-paid engineering job close to home. “My adviser was just, like, ‘Have you ever heard of the oil-and-gas industry?’ ” he said, smiling.</p><p>As a greenhorn drilling engineer with the international mining company BHP Billiton, Latimer was put on a fracking project in the Eagle Ford Shale, in South Texas. The shale, which is a Cretaceous-era formation dense with marine fossils from when the area was an inland sea, is relatively hard and hot. “The motors in our drill systems were failing early,” Latimer said. His supervisors suspected that this was because of the wells’ unusually high temperatures, around a hundred and seventy-five degrees Celsius. “They said, ‘Can you research what tools we could use to deal with the fact that these drilling temperatures are really high?’&nbsp;” Latimer told me.</p><p>Much of the relevant work Latimer came across turned up in papers about geothermal energy. “I’d never heard of geothermal before,” he said. “I was, like, ‘Well, this seems pretty cool.’&nbsp;” When Latimer read the 2006 “Future of Geothermal Energy” report, including its description of the Los Alamos geothermal project, he saw parallels to his work in oil and gas. The report described two big technical challenges that were standing in the way of affordable, bountiful clean energy. One was getting drilling costs down—an area that oil and gas had made great progress in. The other was getting water flowing through hot rock that isn’t sufficiently permeable, like shale, so that you can generate steam. “And I’m just looking at the rig, being, like, ‘This is a solved problem.’&nbsp;” Generating flow where there isn’t much naturally—that’s what hydraulic fracturing does.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Latimer reported what he had found to BHP. The shale drilling started working again, but Latimer’s imagination had shifted. In 2014, he applied to Stanford Business School with the goal of using fracking technology in geothermal wells. “Geothermal is an industry that, frankly, at that point in time, people had given up on as forgotten,” he said. “I didn’t think that was right. I was, like, ‘I’m a drilling engineer. I actually have a skill that can make a direct impact on this.’&nbsp;”</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27595&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27595" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture><img alt="Person wakes up to parents barging into their room with skis ice skates hockey stick and other hobby accessories." loading="lazy" srcset="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/6913865cbf411df7e6af18c2/master/w_120,c_limit/a27595.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/6913865cbf411df7e6af18c2/master/w_240,c_limit/a27595.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/6913865cbf411df7e6af18c2/master/w_320,c_limit/a27595.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/6913865cbf411df7e6af18c2/master/w_640,c_limit/a27595.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/6913865cbf411df7e6af18c2/master/w_960,c_limit/a27595.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/6913865cbf411df7e6af18c2/master/w_1280,c_limit/a27595.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/6913865cbf411df7e6af18c2/master/w_1600,c_limit/a27595.jpg 1600w" sizes="100vw" src="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/6913865cbf411df7e6af18c2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/a27595.jpg"></picture></a><p><span>“No, no, no—I want just one day, totally unscripted!”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Edward Koren</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>In 2017, Latimer and his Stanford colleague Jack Norbeck co-founded Fervo Energy. “Fracking” is an unpopular word. Fervo describes itself as a “next-generation geothermal energy developer.” Just as the fusion-energy industry avoids the phrase “nuclear fusion,” and the term “natural gas” is now used for what is mostly methane, geothermal systems involving hydraulic fracturing tend to be referred to as “enhanced” geothermal systems, or E.G.S.</p><p>In 2023, Fervo drilled a pair of demonstration wells in Nevada, proving its ideas in anticipation of scaling them up. The goal is to begin operating a five-hundred-megawatt geothermal power plant in Cape Station, Utah, with a hundred megawatts going online in 2026. This past June, Fervo drilled a four-and-a-half-kilometre appraisal well—a well for confirming predicted subsurface conditions before going all in on a site—that reached temperatures of two hundred and seventy degrees Celsius. The well was drilled in sixteen days, remarkably fast, and faster drill times mean lowered costs. Fervo’s well design and drilling technologies are central to its hopes, and have helped it raise more than eight hundred million dollars in investment capital. Most everyone I spoke to seems to be rooting for Fervo, albeit with some skepticism. The Utah site is far away from a source for the large amounts of water that will be required, for instance. There are more technical points of concern, too. Fracking can induce seismic activity, so the siting of wells is an important consideration. Enthusiasts see these as solvable problems. And Fervo is not alone in showing promise in the use of fracking to access geothermal power. At the end of October, Mazama Energy demonstrated a pilot E.G.S. in Newberry, Oregon, that works at an even higher temperature: above three hundred degrees Celsius. For now, though, E.G.S. is still a kind of wildcat proposition. “I think the big question is: Who are the next nine Fervos?” Roland Horne, a professor of energy science and engineering at Stanford, who has studied geothermal energy for about fifty years, said. “Fervo has expanded tremendously, they’re a nearly two-hundred-person company, but they don’t have the wherewithal to do a gigawatt project yet.”</p><p>Fervo pitches itself as a landing place for oil-and-gas workers. “I’ve spent a lot of my life and career in small towns where the largest economic driver is oil and gas,” Latimer said. Geothermal means jobs in drilling: engineers, geologists, project managers. Barry Smitherman, who has worked as an oil-and-gas regulator in Texas and as the head of a utility company, told me, “We’ve been drilling oil and gas wells in Texas for over a hundred years. We’ve drilled over a million wells. We know what the world looks like below the surface in Texas.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In February, 2021, Winter Storm Uri left most of Texas without power for days. Not long afterward, Smitherman was asked to speak to state legislators about what went wrong and what needed to change. Soon he got a call from a foundation set up by George Mitchell and his wife, Cynthia. (George, who died in 2013, is known as the “father of fracking.”) The Mitchell Foundation wanted Smitherman to help start a local organization that would advocate on behalf of geothermal energy. He co-founded the Texas Geothermal Energy Alliance in 2022. During his long career in energy, Smitherman said, “we never had a conversation about geothermal. No one had brought it to my attention.” Smitherman had a series of meetings with people from geothermal startups, oil-and-gas companies, the Sierra Club, and utility companies. “What we’ve always said around energy is that you need three legs—reliable, clean, and cheap. Those are the three legs of the stool. The old saying was ‘I can give you two of three, but I can’t give you all three,’ ” he said. “But, as we began to look at geothermal, it really began to look like it had all three—low to no carbon, 24/7, and, as the cost curve comes down, eventually, cheap. It really began to look like this unicorn resource.”</p><p>Tester now teaches at Cornell, near the Finger Lakes, where in the winter Buttermilk and Taughannock Falls turn to blue ribbons of ice. “If we look at the country and say our goal is ultimately to be much more sustainable with respect to our carbon footprint, you can’t ignore heating,” Tester said. Around thirty per cent of New York State’s carbon footprint can be attributed to heating and cooling buildings, a figure that is not far from the worldwide average. “A lot of it is for space heating and water heating, but also for low-temperature food processing, things like that,” Tester added. The excitement about geothermally generated electricity can obscure the thing that geothermal technology is, arguably, best suited to provide. “It’s a little bit apples and oranges, and we need both electricity and heating,” Tester told me. But he went on to explain that using electricity for heating is not nearly as efficient as using heat for heating. And geothermal wells for heating, which can be relatively shallow, can work in places with no hot springs or volcanoes.</p><p>Midtown Manhattan, for example: as part of a major renovation completed in 2017, ten geothermal wells were dug beneath St. Patrick’s Cathedral. Some of the wells are less than a hundred metres deep, while others extend more than six hundred and fifty metres, more than ten times deeper than Manhattan’s deepest subway tunnel—and yet much shallower than the wells needed for a geothermal power plant. These wells carry warmth into the cathedral in winter, and out of the cathedral in summer, and do so with less noise and vibration than typical <em>HVAC</em> systems. The main issue is the upfront cost. When the cathedral’s system was built, it felt radical. One of the lead engineers on the project, Paul Boyce, of P.&nbsp;W. Grosser Consulting, told me that the demand for geothermal heating systems has grown dramatically since then. P.W.G.C.’s current geothermal projects include the Mastercard headquarters, in Purchase, New York, and the Obama Presidential Center, in Chicago. In Greenpoint, Brooklyn, an eight-hundred-and-thirty-four-unit apartment complex that’s under construction has its heating and cooling provided through three hundred boreholes, none much deeper than about a hundred and fifty metres. The system was put in by Geosource Energy, a geothermal company started in 2004.</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"><figure><p><span><picture tabindex="0" role="button"><img alt="Two people standing next to a wellhead" loading="lazy" srcset="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/691263b6602bd3a71973fe49/master/w_120,c_limit/r47996.jpg 120w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/691263b6602bd3a71973fe49/master/w_240,c_limit/r47996.jpg 240w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/691263b6602bd3a71973fe49/master/w_320,c_limit/r47996.jpg 320w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/691263b6602bd3a71973fe49/master/w_640,c_limit/r47996.jpg 640w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/691263b6602bd3a71973fe49/master/w_960,c_limit/r47996.jpg 960w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/691263b6602bd3a71973fe49/master/w_1280,c_limit/r47996.jpg 1280w, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/691263b6602bd3a71973fe49/master/w_1600,c_limit/r47996.jpg 1600w" sizes="100vw" src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/691263b6602bd3a71973fe49/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/r47996.jpg"></picture></span></p><p><span>Tim Latimer (right) at a Fervo wellhead in Utah.</span><span>Photograph by Brandon Thibodeaux / The New York Times / Redux</span></p></figure></div><p>But those projects provide geothermal energy building by building, not district by district. “I wish we were looking at how we plan our cities,” Tester said. “It’s crazy that heating, electricity, cable, water—these are all managed separately.” He is now in the midst of a research project that aims to demonstrate the feasibility of an ambitious geothermal system to serve Cornell’s seven-hundred-and-forty-five-acre campus, something close to what downtown Reykjavík has—but without the aid of close-to-the-surface magma. In the summer of 2022, a rig set up not far from Cornell’s School of Veterinary Medicine drilled for sixty-five days through layers of shale, limestone, and sandstone, passing beyond the geologic time of the dinosaurs to a crystalline basement dating to the Proterozoic eon, more than five hundred million years ago. This created the Cornell University Borehole Observatory (<em>CUBO</em>). In Iceland, if you dig down this deep, the temperatures could easily be four hundred degrees Celsius; in New York, the rocks are cooler, but the Cornell project needs to reach only eighty to ninety degrees Celsius. As <em>CUBO</em> was drilled, rock samples from each depth were analyzed, and the surrounding natural fracture systems were mapped. If <em>CUBO</em> secures more funding, the next stage will be to drill a pair of wells, with one for injecting water to make an underground reservoir and the other to bring the heated water up.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In other geographies, geothermal energy for district heating and cooling has been accomplished with shallower wells. Mieres, Spain, a historic mining town, uses warm water from the now closed mines to supply heat to the region. Nijar, also in Spain but closer to a volcano, uses an underground fluid reservoir to heat its greenhouses. Hayden, Colorado, a former coal town, is working with Bedrock Energy, a Texas-based company started in 2022, to construct a municipal geothermal district, in the hope that reduced energy bills will attract businesses. In Framingham, Massachusetts, activists and a local energy company collaborated on a geothermal heating-and-cooling network, and near Austin, Texas, the neighborhood of Whisper Valley is putting in a similar grid. Several companies, including Bedrock and Dig Energy, are aiming to bring drilling costs down by half or more. Geothermal systems for heating and cooling individual homes remain somewhat pricey to install, but they last for decades, reduce energy bills by twenty-five to fifty per cent, and avoid reliance on the ever more burdened electrical grid. Most people I spoke with in the geothermal industry make their case for it by focussing on cost savings; the unspoken climate benefits are known to those disposed to care, and potentially off-putting to those who are not.</p><p>Some environmentalists argue that the resources given to geothermal—or to small modular nuclear plants, or to fusion—would be better spent elsewhere. Why not just go all in on solar, wind, and batteries, which are proven, scalable technologies? To invest in more speculative solutions, the argument goes, is a moral hazard, and a cynical or naïve distraction that obscures the solutions available now. But this line of thinking rests on the assumption that the people or nations or agencies that would fund one kind of energy would equally fund some other kind. This tends not to be true—funding is rarely fungible, and always capricious. One geothermal-startup founder spoke of receiving a call from a potential investor’s adviser, who said, Sorry, the managing partner wants to invest in a blimp company instead. “Geothermal is the least moral hazard-y of the clean-energy technologies,” Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School, said. “And we are still subsidizing nuclear a thousand times more than geothermal.”</p><p>An energy future without hydrocarbons will require working flexibly with the many variables of resources, geography, and politics. “We can get maybe ninety per cent of the way with solar, batteries, wind,” Leah Stokes, a professor of environmental politics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, told me. “But geothermal is one of the things that can fill that gap.” Investment follows fashion—and geothermal has become fashionable—but it’s not only investors who appear confident about geothermal. Wagner called this “the moment when Ph.D.s meet M.B.A.s.”</p><p>The role of geothermal becomes easier to see when looking beyond the local noise of discussions in America. “You know, there’s this thing called the curse of abundance,” Agnelli Kafuwe, the principal energy officer for the Zambian government, told me. Typically, the phrase refers to countries driven into corruption and misery by their oil endowments, but Kafuwe was referring to Zambia’s seemingly boundless supply of hydroelectric energy, from power stations such as one at the Zambezi River’s Mosi-oa-Tunya, the natural feature known to most Americans as Victoria Falls. For many years, hydropower met practically all of Zambia’s energy needs, even powering its lucrative copper mines.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>But the country’s population grew rapidly, and in 2015 a severe drought hit, forcing Zambia to turn to diesel to make up the shortfall in hydropower. Mosi-oa-Tunya looked less like a world-renowned cataract than like dry, rocky cliffs. There wasn’t enough water to keep the hydropower plants running properly. Lengthy blackouts became common. In 2024, a new drought arrived—the worst in at least a century—and power was cut off for eighteen to twenty hours a day. As in many countries, the leadership had thought about geothermal in the nineteen-seventies but had lost interest; Zambia hadn’t needed it enough then.</p><p>In addition to copper mining, extensive salt mining occurs in northern Zambia. “These mining companies, they would drill down maybe fifty metres, and guess what comes up?” Kafuwe said. “Geothermal steam, of a very high, very good temperature.” The country’s mining history also meant that subsurface maps of its territory already existed—useful for planning geothermal wells. One former mining-company head, Peter Vivian-Neal, now heads Kalahari GeoEnergy, a company he founded after seeing an egg being boiled in a natural hot spring while he was on safari. The company has drilled exploratory wells, done flow tests, well tests, and modelling—it aims to have a demonstration power plant running soon. Vivian-Neal is optimistic that a successful demonstration will bring in more investment. “We could not have got to where we got today if my family hadn’t put in the money to start with,” he told me. “But I’m quite sure that the next person will find it easier. They’ll say, ‘Oh, yes, look, Kalahari has made this a success, therefore we’re going to make it a success, and we’ll do it even faster.’ ”&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Most Miele devices manufactured after 1996 include an optical infrared-based diagnostic interface, hidden behind one of the indicator lights on the front panel. On older appliances, this interface is marked by a <strong>Program Correction (PC)</strong> label.</p>
<p dir="auto">Until now, communication with this interface required an expensive infrared adapter sold exclusively by Miele, along with their closed-source software. The goal of FreeMDU is to make this interface accessible to everyone for diagnostic and home automation purposes.</p>
<p dir="auto">The project is split into three main components:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/medusalix/FreeMDU/blob/master/protocol"><strong>Protocol</strong></a>: core protocol library and device implementations</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/medusalix/FreeMDU/blob/master/tui"><strong>TUI</strong></a>: terminal-based device diagnostic and testing tool</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/medusalix/FreeMDU/blob/master/home"><strong>Home</strong></a>: communication adapter firmware with MQTT integration for Home Assistant</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">More details about the proprietary diagnostic interface and the reverse-engineering process behind this project can be found in this <a href="https://medusalix.github.io/posts/miele-interface" rel="nofollow"><strong>blog post</strong></a>.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Caution</p><p dir="auto">This project is highly experimental and can cause permanent damage to your Miele devices if not used responsibly. Proceed at your own risk.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Supported devices</h2><a id="user-content-supported-devices" aria-label="Permalink: Supported devices" href="#supported-devices"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When a connection is established via the diagnostic interface, the appliance responds with its <strong>software ID</strong>, a 16-bit number that uniquely identifies the firmware version running on the device's microcontroller. However, this ID does not directly correspond to a specific model or board type, so it's impossible to provide a comprehensive list of supported models.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following table lists the software IDs and device/board combinations that have been confirmed to work with FreeMDU:</p>

<p dir="auto">If your appliance is not listed here but has a model number similar to one of the above, it might already be compatible. In all other cases, determining the <strong>software ID</strong> is the first step toward adding support for new devices.</p>
<p dir="auto">Details for adding support for new devices will be provided soon.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>Have you ever noticed just how much of the drama in movies is generated by an unspoken rule that the characters aren’t allowed to communicate well? Instead of naming the problem, they’re forced to skirt around it until the plot makes it impossible to ignore. It’s the cheapest way to build effective drama, but if you don’t fully dissolve yourself in the movie logic, the whole time you want to scream, “can’t anyone just talk about what’s happening directly?!”</p><p><span>Take </span><em>La La Land. </em><span>A huge part of the drama of the movie could have been avoided if the Ryan Gosling character said to the Emma Stone character: “I feel pressure to get a steady gig that includes lots of time on the road because I sense you want me to grow up and get real about my career. Could we talk about whether that’s what you actually want, and get clearer about our priorities?” Instead, they never talk about it, and the relationship explodes as a result of their misaligned expectations.</span></p><p><span>Or: </span><em>Good Will Hunting. </em><span>The entire movie feels like it could’ve been skipped if literally any emotionally intelligent person said to Matt Damon’s character: “I feel like you have a tremendous amount of intellectual potential that you’re wasting here — why are you getting in fights rather than trying to do something interesting?”</span></p><p><span>Communication failures like these make for good storytelling where we, the audience, get to watch the characters stumble towards understanding. But you shouldn’t </span><em>live</em><span> like someone waiting for the screenwriter of your life to arrange a convenient resolution. Functional people don’t let things linger unspoken — they name what’s facing them out loud.</span></p><p>It sounds like such a simple thing. And yet, so many of us don’t do it. It’s my experience that movie logic is endemic in dysfunctional organizations, friendships, and marriages. People walk around in a haze of denial, simply assuming that their concerns will disappear. They wait until the problem can’t possibly be ignored anymore, instead of naming it well before it becomes critical. Maybe they don’t even realize at a conscious level that the dynamic in question is capable of being named; they just take it as a background fact about the universe that they can strain against but not change.</p><p>What does it look like when you break out of movie logic? I remember the first time I realized I could do this. I was at a bar during my first year of law school with a bunch of people from my class, including a woman with whom I had an awkward dynamic stemming from an unfortunate misunderstanding about a guy. This awkwardness had calcified in my emotional brain to “we don’t like each other, we have beef.” But on that particular evening I had a moment of clarity, and instead of trying to avoid her I walked up to her and said, “I feel like we got off on the wrong foot because of that stupid thing, and I’m sorry about that — I don’t have anything against you at all.” In an instant, the look of flat wariness she’d put on when she saw me walking over melted into relief, and she said “I’m so glad you said that, I’ve been feeling awful about it.” She went on to be my closest friend in law school.</p><p><span>Outcomes like this are common when you figure out how to break the fourth wall. Whether or not both of you were already conscious of the real, underlying issue, when it is spoken out loud, the result is usually </span><em>relief</em><span>, like a spell has been broken. Even if the content is uncomfortable, it feels good in the way cutting through layers of unreality always does.</span></p><p>Some other lines of dialogue that would make for bad movies, but good living:</p><ul><li><p>“I’ve noticed that lately, every time we have plans to hang out one-on-one, you invite someone else to join us — is that intentional?”</p></li><li><p>“I always feel a little awkward around you, and I’m worried it comes across as me not liking you — I just wanted to say that’s not the case.”</p></li><li><p>“I’ve been feeling a low-level tension between us, like maybe we’re quietly annoyed at each other but trying to stay polite. Is that just me?”</p></li><li><p>“It sometimes seems like when I push back in meetings, it changes the energy in the room — like maybe you’re afraid to engage with me as directly as you do other people. Does that feel true?”</p></li></ul><p>Reading these examples, you might have noticed that it’s rare to hear people talk like this. I think there are a couple of reasons for that.</p><p>One is that it’s easy to mistake silence for informed diplomacy. If your manager is stressing you out, and you are putting up with it, it’s easy to think that you’re just being a good employee, and everyone is aware of how good you’re being. But unless your manager is quite emotionally intelligent, they may have no idea that you’re unhappy, especially if you’re engaging in people-pleasing behavior to try and cover it up.</p><p>Another reason is that it can feel like by naming an issue, you are making it into a big deal. But problems are real, and exert a toll on you, whether you name them or not. Naming the issue means you can interact with it.</p><p><span>Finally — often, the people who are most eager to name issues </span><em>kind of suck. </em><span>They are critical, judgmental people who lob opinions about how others should live without skill. Think of the person you’ve just met who confidently offers unsolicited advice about whatever they imagine your problem is.</span></p><p>But the answer to this is not to maintain the conspiracy of silence. The answer is to get skillful at naming issues.</p><p><strong>Tip 1: Take yourself outside the movie</strong></p><p>Before you even name an issue, it can help to ask: Actually, is this really the important issue to name? Or is my feeling about the issue a manifestation of something deeper that would be even more powerful to tackle?</p><p>For example, let’s say you want to tell a friend that you were bothered by the way they were bragging about how lavish and expensive their wedding was. Is that really the root issue? Or is the real issue an underlying dynamic of competitiveness stoked by both parties, where the relationship is worse off because both of you fill every conversation with social status claims?</p><p>To locate the possibility of going deeper, it can be helpful to take the movie metaphor literally — if you were an audience member watching the movie, what would you be screaming at yourself to say? What would a reader of this screenplay say the real, big unnamed issue is?</p><p><strong>Tip 2: If you feel you can’t name the problem, say that</strong></p><p>Let’s say you want to name a problem in one of your relationships, but you’re worried that presenting the problem would start an argument. Congratulations. You have now found the problem to name. You are allowed to say the following: “There’s an issue I see in our relationship, and I want to address it so our relationship is stronger. But I’m nervous about naming it, because I’m worried that it could start an argument, and I really don’t want you to feel attacked.”</p><p><span>This is advice that is applicable annoyingly often, to any meta-problem that makes a conversation difficult. </span><strong>You can always address the secondary problem.</strong><span> Many relationship advice conversations I have with friends go like this.</span></p><p><span>Friend: “I want to talk about [issue]</span><strong> </strong><span>with my partner, but when I get into the issue, I get flustered about it and stop making sense.”</span></p><p>Me: “Okay, what if you say that: I want to talk about this issue but it makes me flustered, and I stop making sense.”</p><p>Friend: “... Oh, why didn’t I think of that?”</p><p>The reason that they don’t think of it, I suspect, is that one way to avoid difficult conversations is to come up with a secondary problem that offers an excuse for avoiding the conflict, and then assume it’s impassable.</p><p><strong>Tip 3: Name things before you’re sure of what they are</strong></p><p>Sometimes, it’s hard to name a problem because you don’t fully understand it yet. But that’s completely okay — in many settings, you don’t even have to fully understand your feelings, or what is wrong, before you name a conflict. It can be powerful to say: “Something felt off about that meeting, like maybe something important wasn’t being said.” Or: “I think there’s something weird happening in this conversation, but I don’t know what it is.”</p><p>Human beings are near-telepathic in our ability to sense when an interpersonal dynamic is off — when someone is emotionally uncomfortable, or engaging in concealment. We all know the itchy feeling when nobody in an interaction is really being sincere. Pretty amazing how psychic we are, right?</p><p><span>Yes, we are psychic, but we are also stupid. Our sense that</span><em> something is weird </em><span>is often accurate, but our stories about precisely what the weirdness represents</span><em> </em><span>are often way, way off. So, in order to move from an interesting intuition to an accurate story about reality, it helps to enlist other people in the discussion by naming the intuition.</span></p><p>I’ve historically been hesitant to present my intuitions, because it feels sloppy. But having on more than one occasion overcome a “funny feeling” about a good-on-paper candidate to bad results, I’m now eager to make statements like: “It might not mean anything, but I can’t shake a weird feeling about that person. Do you get that same thing?”</p><p>This requires a little social discernment, of course. If you are a junior employee in a new workplace, it might not be tactically prudent to approach the CEO with the statement, “hey, couldn’t help but notice that the vibes are off.” But if you work closely with someone, err on the side of transparency.</p><p>You might ask — ultimately, what is so wrong with movie logic? Maybe you don’t have to address everything now. Sometimes a solution will present itself. And, I agree. It’s not fatal to, on occasion, engage in a little bit of hopeful silence, to see whether the problem you’re having with someone else is just a mood that might shift.</p><p>But over time, hopeful silence has corrosive effects. If you don’t name the real problems in your life, you eventually become alienated from your inner compass. You stop paying attention to your life on an experiential level, because you want to live in a pretend world of self-consolation. You lose the ability to see your life honestly.</p><p>Sometimes, I notice this when working with people who have spent time in organizations with poor feedback cultures. They have been taught that it’s so bad to name problems that they focus on resolving acute issues while keeping the peace, all the while navigating an invisible psychological obstacle course. Over time, they become trapped in people-pleasing, and this can blind them to real issues in the substance of their work. When people are like this, it’s difficult to get them to improve, because they see it as psychologically damaging to recognize their own limitations.</p><p>This is a skill I’m still working to get better at. It’s truly rare that someone reaches the ceiling — having no resistance to naming issues, and being maximally skillful about doing it. I’m not there yet. But I’m on my way, and it feels good to be moving in that direction. The better I get at it, the less I’m threatened by conflict, and the more it seems like an opportunity to clarify what’s really going on, to grow closer to myself and others. I don’t want to be the character in the movie who’s hopelessly buffeted by intrigue and too scared to investigate it dispassionately. I want to be like the director, who thoroughly understands the drama of each character, and finds the scene all the more interesting as a result.</p><p><em><strong><a href="https://mailchi.mp/44578760e686/book-preorder-signup" rel="">Sign up to be notified</a><span> when my book, You Can Just Do Things, is available for purchase.</span></strong></em></p></div></div>]]></description>

    <p><em>The story of how I wrote a leak-free, thread-safe grep in C23 without shooting yourself in the foot, and how you can too!</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Let's be honest: most people have a love-hate relationship with C. We love its raw speed, its direct connection to the metal, and its elegant simplicity. But we hate its footguns, its dragons, the untamed beasts. The segfaults that appear from nowhere, the memory leaks that slowly drain the life from our applications, and the endless goto cleanup; chains that make our code look like a plate of spaghetti pasta.</p>
<p>This is the classic C curse: power without guardrails...at least that's the <em>fear mongering mantra</em> being said again and again. But is that still relevant in today's world with all the tools available for C devs like static analyzer and dynamic sanitizers? I've written about this <a href="https://hwisnu.bearblog.dev/make-c-safe-again/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://hwisnu.bearblog.dev/debunking-the-unsafe-c-myths-part-2/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>What if, with the help of the modern tools and a custom header file (600 loc), you could tame those footguns beasts? What if you could keep C's power but wrap it in a suit of modern armor? That's what the custom header file safe_c.h is for. It's designed to give C some <mark>safety and convenience features from C++ and Rust</mark>, and I'm using it to build a high-performance grep clone called cgrep as my test case.</p>
<p>By the end this article I hope it could provide the audience with the idea of C is super flexible and extensible, sort of <em>"do whatever you want with it"</em> kind of thing. And this is why C (and its close cousin: Zig) remain to be my favorite language to write programs in; it's the language of freedom!</p>
<h2 id="safe_ch">safe_c.h</h2><p>Is a custom C header file that takes features mainly from C++ and Rust and implements them into our C code ~ [write C code, get C++ and Rust features!]</p>
<p>It starts by bridging the gap between old and new C. C23 gave us <code>[[cleanup]]</code> attributes, but in the real world, you need code that compiles on GCC 11 or Clang 18. safe_c.h detects your compiler and gives you the same RAII semantics everywhere. No more <code>#ifdef</code> soup.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>// The magic behind CLEANUP: zero overhead, maximum safety
#if defined(__STDC_VERSION__) &amp;&amp; __STDC_VERSION__ &gt;= 202311L
#define CLEANUP(func) [[cleanup(func)]]
#else
#define CLEANUP(func) __attribute__((cleanup(func)))
#endif

// Branch prediction that actually matters in hot paths
#ifdef __GNUC__
#define LIKELY(x)   __builtin_expect(!!(x), 1)
#define UNLIKELY(x) __builtin_expect(!!(x), 0)
#else
#define LIKELY(x)   (x)
#define UNLIKELY(x) (x)
#endif
</pre></div>
<p>Your cleanup code runs even if you return early, goto out, or panic. It's <code>finally</code>, but for C.</p>
<h2 id="the-memory-management-beast-slain-with-smart-pointers-c-feature">The Memory Management Beast: Slain with Smart Pointers (C++ feature)</h2><p>The oldest, fiercest and most feared by devs: manual memory management.</p>
<p>Before: the highway path to leaks.<br>
Forgetting a single <code>free()</code> is a disaster. In cgrep, parsing command-line options the old way is a breeding ground for CVEs and its bestiary. You have to remember to free the memory on every single exit path, difficult for the undisciplined.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// The Old Way (don't do this)</span>
<span>char</span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>include_pattern</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>optarg</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>include_pattern</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>strdup</span><span>(</span><span>optarg</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>// ...200 lines later...</span>
<span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>some_error</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>include_pattern</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>free</span><span>(</span><span>include_pattern</span><span>);</span><span> </span><span>// Did I free it? Did I??</span>
<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>// And remember to free it at *every* return path...</span>
</pre></div>
<p>After: memory that <strong>automatically</strong> cleans itself up.<br>
UniquePtr is a "smart pointer" that owns a resource. When the UniquePtr variable goes out of scope, its resource is automatically freed. It's impossible to forget.</p>
<p>Here's the machinery inside <code>safe_c.h</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>// The UniquePtr machinery: a struct + automatic cleanup
typedef struct {
    void* ptr;
    void (*deleter)(void*);
} UniquePtr;

#define AUTO_UNIQUE_PTR(name, ptr, deleter) \
    UniquePtr name CLEANUP(unique_ptr_cleanup) = UNIQUE_PTR_INIT(ptr, deleter)

static inline void unique_ptr_cleanup(UniquePtr* uptr) {
    if (uptr &amp;&amp; uptr-&gt;ptr &amp;&amp; uptr-&gt;deleter) {
        uptr-&gt;deleter(uptr-&gt;ptr);
        uptr-&gt;ptr = NULL;
    }
}
</pre></div>
<p>And here's how cgrep uses it. The cleanup is automatic, even if errors happen:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// In cgrep, we use this for command-line arguments</span>
<span>AUTO_UNIQUE_PTR</span><span>(</span><span>include_pattern_ptr</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>NULL</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>options_string_deleter</span><span>);</span>

<span>// When we get a new pattern, the old one is automatically freed!</span>
<span>unique_ptr_delete</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>include_pattern_ptr</span><span>);</span>
<span>include_pattern_ptr</span><span>.</span><span>ptr</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>strdup</span><span>(</span><span>optarg</span><span>);</span>
<span>// No leaks, even if an error happens later!</span>
</pre></div>
<p><strong>Sharing Safely with SharedPtr</strong></p>
<p>Before: manual, bug-prone reference counting.<br>
You'd have to implement reference counting by hand, creating a complex and fragile system where a single mistake leads to a leak or a use-after-free bug.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// The old way of manual reference counting</span>

<h2 id="concurrency-mutexes-that-unlock-themselves-rust-feature">Concurrency: Mutexes That Unlock Themselves (Rust feature)</h2><p>Before: leaked locks and deadlocks.<br>
Forgetting to unlock a mutex, especially on an error path, is a catastrophic bug that causes your program to deadlock.</p>

<p>After: RAII-based locks.<br>
Using the same CLEANUP attribute, we can ensure a mutex is always unlocked when the scope is exited. This bug becomes impossible to write.</p>

    thrd_create(&amp;name, (func), (arg))

    thrd_join(name, NULL)
</pre></div>
<p>And in cgrep:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>// Thread pool spawn without boilerplate
SPAWN_THREAD(workers[i], file_processing_worker, &amp;contexts[i]);

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In the end, cgrep is 2,300 lines of C. Without safe_c.h, it would have required over 50 manual free() calls ~ a recipe for leaks and segfaults. With the custom header file, it's 2,300 lines that compile to the same assembly, run just as fast, and are fundamentally safer.</p>
<p>This proves that the best abstraction is the one you don't pay for and can't forget to use. It enables a clear and powerful development pattern: validate inputs at the boundary, then unleash C's raw speed on the core logic. You get all the power of C without the infamous self-inflicted footgun wounds.</p>
<p>C simplicity makes writing programs with it becomes fun, however there are ways to make it both <strong>fun and safe</strong>..just like using condoms, you know?</p>
<p>This post has gotten too long for comfort, but I have one final food for thought for you the readers: after all these guard rails, what do you think of cgrep's performance? Check the screenshots below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>grep bench on recursive directories
<img src="https://i.ibb.co.com/ZpKKd4FS/grep-bench-recursive-Dirs.png" alt="recursive-Dirs"></p>
</li>
<li><p>grep bench on single large file
<img src="https://i.ibb.co.com/qMKqFhmm/grep-bench-single-Large-File.png" alt="Large-File">
<strong>NOTE: make sure you check the memory usage comparison between cgrep and ripgrep</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In the next article, I will discuss how I built cgrep, the design I chose for it, why and how cgrep managed to be a couple of times faster than ripgrep (more than 2x faster in the recursive directory bench) while being super efficient with resource usage (20x smaller memory footprint in the single large file bench).</p>
<p>It's gonna be a lot of fun! Cheers!</p>
