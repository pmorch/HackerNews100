            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/meta/645012/meta-llama-4-maverick-benchmarks-gaming">https://www.theverge.com/meta/645012/meta-llama-4-maverick-benchmarks-gaming</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43620452">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Over the weekend, Meta dropped two new <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/">Llama 4 models</a>: a smaller model named Scout, and Maverick, a mid-size model that the company claims can beat GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash “across a broad range of widely reported benchmarks.”</p><p>Maverick quickly secured the number-two spot on LMArena, the AI benchmark site where humans compare outputs from different systems and vote on the best one. In Meta’s <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/">press release</a>, the company highlighted Maverick’s ELO score of 1417, which placed it above OpenAI’s 4o and just under Gemini 2.5 Pro. (A higher ELO score means the model wins more often in the arena when going head-to-head with competitors.)</p><p>The achievement seemed to position Meta’s open-weight Llama 4 as a serious challenger to the state-of-the-art, closed models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Then, AI researchers digging through Meta’s documentation discovered something unusual.</p><p>In fine print, Meta acknowledges that the version of Maverick tested on LMArena isn’t the same as what’s available to the public. According to Meta’s own materials, it deployed an <a href="https://x.com/natolambert/status/1908913635373842655">“experimental chat version”</a> of Maverick to LMArena that was specifically “optimized for conversationality,” <em>TechCrunch</em> first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/06/metas-benchmarks-for-its-new-ai-models-are-a-bit-misleading/">reported</a>.</p><p>“Meta’s interpretation of our policy did not match what we expect from model providers,” LMArena <a href="https://x.com/lmarena_ai/status/1909397817434816562">posted</a> on X two days after the model’s release. “Meta should have made it clearer that ‘Llama-4-Maverick-03-26-Experimental’ was a customized model to optimize for human preference. As a result of that, we are updating our leaderboard policies to reinforce our commitment to fair, reproducible evaluations so this confusion doesn’t occur in the future.“</p><p>A spokesperson for Meta, Ashley Gabriel, said in an emailed statement that “we experiment with all types of custom variants.”</p><p>“‘Llama-4-Maverick-03-26-Experimental’ is a chat optimized version we experimented with that also performs well on LMArena,” Gabriel said. “We have now released our open source version and will see how developers customize Llama 4 for their own use cases. We’re excited to see what they will build and look forward to their ongoing feedback.”</p><p>While what Meta did with Maverick isn’t explicitly against LMArena’s rules, the site has shared concerns <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/policy/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">about gaming the system</a> and taken steps to “prevent overfitting and benchmark leakage.” When companies can submit specially-tuned versions of their models for testing while releasing different versions to the public, benchmark rankings like LMArena become less meaningful as indicators of real-world performance.</p><p>”It’s the most widely respected general benchmark because all of the other ones suck,” independent AI researcher Simon Willison tells <em>The Verge</em>. “When Llama 4 came out, the fact that it came second in the arena, just after Gemini 2.5 Pro — that really impressed me, and I’m kicking myself for not reading the small print.”</p><p>Shortly after Meta released Maverick and Scout, the AI community started <a href="https://x.com/Yuchenj_UW/status/1909061004207816960">talking about a rumor</a> that Meta had also trained its Llama 4 models to perform better on benchmarks while hiding their real limitations. VP of generative AI at Meta, Ahmad Al-Dahle, addressed the accusations <a href="https://x.com/Ahmad_Al_Dahle/status/1909302532306092107">in a post on X</a>: “We’ve also heard claims that we trained on test sets -- that’s simply not true and we would never do that. Our best understanding is that the variable quality people are seeing is due to needing to stabilize implementations.”</p><div><p>“It’s a very confusing release generally.”</p></div><p>Some <a href="https://x.com/kalomaze/status/1908706389922324599">also noticed</a> that Llama 4 was released at an odd time. Saturday doesn’t tend to be when big AI news drops. After someone on Threads asked why Llama 4 was released over the weekend, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/DIFAsupTS7Z">replied</a>: “That’s when it was ready.”</p><p>“It’s a very confusing release generally,” says Willison, who <a href="https://simonwillison.net/">closely follows and documents AI models</a>. “The model score that we got there is completely worthless to me. I can’t even use the model that they got a high score on.”</p><p>Meta’s path to releasing Llama 4 wasn’t exactly smooth. According <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-nears-release-new-ai-model-performance-hiccups?rc=mshudk">to a recent report</a> from <em>The Information</em>, the company repeatedly pushed back the launch due to the model failing to meet internal expectations. Those expectations are especially high after DeepSeek, an open-source AI startup from China, released an open-weight model that generated a ton of buzz.</p><p>Ultimately, using an optimized model in LMArena puts developers in a difficult position. When selecting models like Llama 4 for their applications, they naturally look to benchmarks for guidance. But as is the case for Maverick, those benchmarks can reflect capabilities that aren’t actually available in the models that the public can access.</p><p>As AI development accelerates, this episode shows how benchmarks are becoming battlegrounds. It also shows how Meta is eager to be seen as an AI leader, even if that means gaming the system.</p><p><strong>Update, April 7th:</strong> <em>The story was updated to add Meta’s statement.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tailscale has raised $160 million USD ($230 million CAD) in our Series C, led by Accel with participation from CRV, Insight Partners, Heavybit, and Uncork Capital. Existing angel investor George Kurtz - CEO of Crowdstrike is also included in this round, as well as Anthony Casalena - CEO of Squarespace, who joins as a new investor for Series C.</p><p>There’s a lot packed into that sentence. But the real question is — why should you care?</p><p><img _type="asset" video="[object Object]" alt="$160 Million Series C" loading="lazy" width="2304" height="1240" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/w77i7m8x/production/a2d4cd932d9b8c035b001b367707d080a8f66f85-2304x1240.png?w=3840&amp;q=75&amp;fit=clip&amp;auto=format 1x" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/w77i7m8x/production/a2d4cd932d9b8c035b001b367707d080a8f66f85-2304x1240.png?w=3840&amp;q=75&amp;fit=clip&amp;auto=format"></p><h3 id="venture-money-is-a-tool"><a href="#venture-money-is-a-tool">Venture money is a tool.<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h3><p>When we started Tailscale in 2019, we weren't even sure we wanted to be a venture-backed company. We just wanted to fix networking. Or, more specifically, make networking disappear — reduce the number of times anyone had to think about NAT traversal or VPN configurations ever again.</p><p>That might sound simple, but it wasn’t. Here we are, six years later, and millions of people rely on Tailscale every day, connecting their homelabs, their apps, their companies, their <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/blog/ai-normal">AI workloads</a>. Some use it because they love networking and want better tools. Many use it because they have better things to do – they don’t want to think about networking at all.</p><p>Either way, the outcome is the same: things connect, securely and privately, without the traditional headaches.</p><p><img _type="asset" video="[object Object]" alt="Identity first, Decentralized, Empowered" loading="lazy" width="2304" height="1240" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/w77i7m8x/production/976379382bac07b73dead2b27f3f75bac6665e08-2304x1240.png?w=3840&amp;q=75&amp;fit=clip&amp;auto=format 1x" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/w77i7m8x/production/976379382bac07b73dead2b27f3f75bac6665e08-2304x1240.png?w=3840&amp;q=75&amp;fit=clip&amp;auto=format"></p><h3 id="this-round-isnt-about-us-its-about-what-we-build-next-for-you"><a href="#this-round-isnt-about-us-its-about-what-we-build-next-for-you">This round isn’t about us — it’s about what we build next, for you.<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h3><p>Even though we already had a long runway, we raised this Series C because we realized the world had started raining opportunities. We want to go faster where it matters:</p><ul><li>Removing friction</li><li>Scaling the network without scaling complexity</li><li>Making identity, not IP addresses, the core of secure connectivity</li></ul><p>The Internet wasn’t built with identity in mind. It was built for location — packets sent between machines, not people. Everything that came after — VPNs, firewalls, Zero Trust — are attempts to patch over that original gap.</p><p>We think there’s a better way forward. We're calling it <strong>identity-first networking.</strong></p><p>When you connect to something with Tailscale, you’re not just an IP connecting to a server at some IP. You’re connecting to your app, your teammate, your service — wherever it happens to be running right now.

The AI industry, in particular, is struggling to rapidly mature its underlying infrastructure. Connecting GPUs across clouds, securing workloads across continents, migrating between cloud providers — it’s messy, it’s hard, and it breaks all the time.</p><p>A surprising number of leading AI companies — Perplexity, Mistral, Cohere, Groq, Hugging Face — are now building on Tailscale to solve exactly this.</p><p>It’s not just AI. Companies like Instacart, SAP, Telus, Motorola, and Duolingo and <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/blog/welcome-grace-lin-10000-customers">thousands of others</a> use Tailscale to make their hybrid, remote, and cloud networks sane again.</p><p>This new funding helps us support all of that, faster.

      <p>Clean power provided 40% of the world's electricity last year for the first time since the 1940s, new figures show.</p><p>Clean energy comes from nuclear and renewable sources like wind and solar.</p>
<p>The milestone has been reached thanks to the "staggering" rise of solar, which has doubled in just three years, energy thinktank Ember said in its new report.</p><p>And solar was the fastest-growing electricity source for the 20th year in a row.</p><p>It now provides 7% of the world's electricity.</p>
<p>But it remains eclipsed by wind, which grew to 8% last year, and nuclear to 9%.</p><p>Hydropower - produced by running water, usually from rivers or reservoirs, and the world's oldest and largest single source of renewable power - has hovered at 14%.</p><p>Phil MacDonald, Ember's managing director, said: "Paired with battery storage, solar is set to be an unstoppable force.</p><p>"As the fastest-growing and largest source of new electricity, it is critical in meeting the world's ever-increasing demand for electricity."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’re a few years into a supposed artificial intelligence revolution, which could and should have been about reducing mundane tasks and freeing everyone up to do more interesting things with their time. Instead, thanks to the bloodthirsty nature of modern capitalism and an ideological crusade being waged by the tech industry, we’re now facing a world where many people’s livelihoods–like video game developers–are under direct threat.</p><p>These tumultuous times are of course being reported on everywhere you look, <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including on this very website</a>, but one area I’ve been curious about recently aren’t the broader moral and legal battles, but what the struggle looks like for the average dev who is now having to encounter AI in their workplace.</p><p>For this piece, I spoke with a number of people working in the video game industry or very close to it, including artists, game designers, and software developers. I asked them to tell their stories about their daily interactions and struggles with&nbsp;artificial intelligence in the workplace, and what it means for the jobs they've been trained and hired to do.</p><p>Each person’s name and workplace has been changed to protect their identity.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>[He] can’t even write a fucking email without using Chat GPT...</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Bradley </strong>is a veteran artist who works at a AAA video game studio. They describe the company as having been founded relatively recently, with investment coming from traditional AAA executives who “want to make money, and they are trying to figure out what game to make for that”.&nbsp;</p><p>They say their project’s art direction has been largely fuelled by AI prompts and generated imagery, all driven by their head Art Director, who is himself an experienced video game artist, but who now “can’t even write a fucking email without using Chat GPT”.&nbsp;</p><p>“In my interview with the company I was very clear that I do not like AI-generated content”, Bradley says, and adds that the team initially said that was fine, the tech was only being used for pitching purposes. But Bradley says the reality has proven vastly different, and that the studio has made increasing use of AI-generated imagery in their team's art pipeline.</p><p>“I have no idea how he ended up as an art director when he can’t visualise what he wants in his head unless can see some end results”, Bradley says. Rather than beginning with sketches and ideas, then iterating on those to produce a more finalised image or vision, Bradley says his boss will just keep prompting an AI for images until he finds one he likes, and then the art team will have to backwards engineer the whole thing to make it work.</p><p>“He doesn't know that the important thing isn't just the end result, it's the journey and the questions you answer along the way”. Bradley says that the studio’s management have become so enamoured with the technology that without a reliance on AI-generated imagery for presentations and pitches they would not be at the stage they are now, which is dealing with publishers and investors.&nbsp;</p><p>Bradley says they’ve threatened to quit if further attempts are made to use AI in the art pipeline. While the art team continues to resist the use of AI in creating actual concept pieces and assets for the game, it’s a different story when it comes to pitching the project to those publishers and investors.</p><p>“They’re finding it difficult to get funding because the game is being treated as a car salesman’s pitch, using AI-generated imagery to sell it without any actual substance or meat to back the vision up. The whole game is resting on a prompt ‘what if a game was…’, but with no idea if that would be fun, or how to make it fun. It’s madness”.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>I had a meeting with the CEO where he told me he noticed I wasn't using the Chat GPT account the company had given me. I wasn't really aware the company was tracking that.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Mitch </strong>has been working in software for over seven years. Having previously been employed in the defense industry, their last job was writing developer tools for a small tech startup creating an app. The company was built with some initial interest in artificial intelligence, though Mitch says this was met with “varying levels of scepticism” by employees.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was the most opposed”, Mitch says, “to the point where I felt it was a detriment. One team member who only ended up working there for a few months was very positive on it. The CEO was sceptical but felt like it could be a massive benefit if used correctly, and the other team members saw it as a fun toy that could occasionally be useful. So it was pretty broad across the board”.</p><p>Some at the company were uneasy with the technology early on, when the team initially had just a small AI plugin through which users could chat with the app. “On the way to the airport with a co-worker we talked about the introduction of these AI-generated plugins”, Mitch says. “Both of us felt incredibly uneasy with them. Despite [my coworker] finding AI to be a fun toy, he was worried that it wasn't what he had initially signed up for, and I had more or less the same sentiment. It didn't really boil over into anything at this point since the feature didn't go anywhere, but it was still notable”.</p><p>A few months later, things started to change. Mitch says the first signs of a deepening reliance on AI came when the company’s CEO was found to be rewriting parts of their app so that it would be easier for AI models to understand and help with. “Then”, Mitch says, “I had a meeting with the CEO where he told me he noticed I wasn't using the Chat GPT account the company had given me. I wasn't really aware the company was tracking that”.</p><p>“Anyway, he told me that I would need to start using Chat GPT to speed up my development process. Furthermore, he said I should start using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_(language_model)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Claude</a>, another AI tool, to just wholesale create new features for the app. He walked me through setting up the accounts and had me write one with Claude while I was on call with him. I’m still not entirely sure why he did that, but I think it may have been him trying to convince himself that it would work.”</p><p>Mitch describes this increasing reliance on AI to be not just “incredibly boring”, but ultimately pointless. “Sure, it was faster, but it had a completely different development rhythm”, they say. “In terms of software quality, I would say the code created by the AI was worse than code written by a human–though not drastically so–and was difficult to work with since most of it hadn’t been written by the people whose job it was to oversee it”.&nbsp;</p><p>“One thing to note is that just the thought of using AI to generate code was so demotivating that I think it would counteract any of the speed gains that the tool would provide, and on top of that would produce worse code than I didn’t understand. And that’s not even mentioning the ethical concerns of a tool built on plagiarism.”</p><p>Mitch says that over the 18 months they worked with the company, its CEO had transformed from someone mildly positive about AI to emphasising to workers that “AI was the future”. “In particular, he was of the belief that developers who are able to use AI to accelerate their process are going to win out in the future. I have seen this sentiment in other places worded as ‘an AI won't replace you, but a programmer who knows how to use AI will’. He didn’t believe that 18 months ago, but he absolutely believes it now”.&nbsp;</p><p>The AI’s poor code and a personal dislike of the technology meant that Mitch soon simply began ignoring their CEO’s instructions to use Chat GPT and Claude. A few months later, the entire company went bust. &nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>The only issue I am facing as a professional art director in games is that I just want them to leave me and my art teams alone.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Francis </strong>is both a consultant and artist in the video game industry, and so has worked alongside art teams as well as working with agencies, studios and publishers about their creative processes. “This means I have had some truly wild conversations about AI in a professional context that make me want to walk into the sea”, they say.</p><p>Since AI-generated imagery first blew up a few years ago, Francis has found that discussions both with consulting clients and potential employers for their own art has “shifted”. They believe that most employers and outsiders they speak to don’t see themselves as part of what Francis calls an ‘AI will replace artists!’ crowd, but are more like a ‘if we use AI it’ll make an artist’s life easier’ crowd, who think using AI in art will protect their artists, not displace them.</p><p>“What follows from these discussions is me explaining why, usually over hours rather than minutes, that these tools have no place in a professional game development pipeline or production and actually hinder the development of visuals”, Francis says. “I also find myself explaining to them how the iteration and 'idea' phase of a project is where the best stuff happens, how exploring things through artistic labor is where your best ideas come to fruition, and why would we want an AI (that we don't even own) to do that for us with art that isn't ours to use?”</p><p>“I am yet to have a team or gamerunner push back on me once I actually explain how these AI art generators work and how they don't contribute in a helpful way to a project, but I have a sense of dread that it is only a matter of time until that changes, especially given that I've gone the majority of my career with no mention of them to every second conversation having it mentioned.”</p><p>This all sounds <em>slightly </em>more optimistic than what other people I spoke with expressed, but Francis also added that a close family member is “neck-deep in the technology side of the AI industry”, and that “while conversation with them mostly gives me the desire to purchase cigarettes for the first time in a very long time, it also gives me insight into how these people feel when they say they are 'helping' my industry and 'innovating' to make artists' lives better.”</p><p>Francis says their understanding of the AI-pusher’s outlook is that they see the entire game-making process as a problem, one that AI tech companies alone can solve. “When I’m told 'Think of how much time you could be spending instead on making the actual game!', those who have drank the AI Kool-Aid don't understand that all this brainstorming and iteration <em>is </em>making the game, it’s a crucial everyday part of game development (and human interaction) and is not a problem to be solved.”</p><p>“My experience here is unfortunately not singular”, Francis says. “I have had many discussions with other game developers who interact with AI engineers and savants who believe our industry pipelines need 'fixing' by them and them alone. The only other similar experience I can think of as a comparison is a snake oil salesman insisting that their magic tonic will fix all of my problems that don't exist but they insist that I have.”</p><p>Francis believes that there’s a common thread running through both their lines of work: that those selling AI tools and those advocating for their use, whatever their best intentions, think that AI is solving a huge problem games industry workers are facing. “The only issue I am facing as a professional art director in games is that I just want them to leave me and my art teams alone so we can make cool art. There is no problem to be solved here”.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?w=1440&amp;h=810&amp;crop=1" srcset="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=480,270&amp;quality=75 480w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=960,540&amp;quality=75 960w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=640,360&amp;quality=75 640w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=1280,720&amp;quality=75 1280w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=1536,864&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=1024,576&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=2048,1152&amp;quality=75 2048w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=1280,720&amp;quality=75 1280w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=2560,1440&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=1440,810&amp;quality=75 1440w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=2880,1620&amp;quality=75 2880w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"><figcaption><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/robot-kick-female-employee-out-office-2229371365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Drawlab19</a></figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote><p>It was a huge waste of time, and really felt like an affront to my own expertise, which is... why I was hired.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Ricky </strong>is a senior game designer who says they were often asked to use AI on their last project, initially with the goal of saving time on basic tasks. One example they shared was being encouraged to use Chat GPT to do things like “generate outlines of existing games and their systems so that we could use them as references and discussion points. The issue? [The outlines] were often wrong, and I'd spend more time fixing them than if I'd just done it the old-fashioned way”.</p><p>Since the AI was generating responses for games Ricky was already familiar with, they could easily see that those responses were fundamentally incorrect. ”When I say they were wrong”, Ricky says, ” I mean they were talking about systems that didn't exist, items that didn't exist, and outlines of enemies that had incorrect explanations of their behaviour”.</p><p>“There were more superfluous issues as well -- the whole thing read like marketing speak. There were buzzwords everywhere, it wasn't concise, and if I were to try and fix these issues using different prompts, or continuing my conversation with [the AI], well, then I'm just spending time prompt-engineering instead of just writing the fucking thing myself. It was a huge waste of time, and really felt like an affront to my own expertise, which is... why I was hired”.</p><p>Ricky says they were also asked to use Chat GPT as an “idea generator”, to help with tasks like “coming up with a bunch of interesting puzzles” or “creating ideas for enemies”, supposedly to both save time and provide inspirational starting points.&nbsp;</p><p>“It really weighed on the creativity of my role, and again, spat in the face of my expertise”, they say. “It wasn't just this though; the tool itself lacks the intent, context, and limitations of what we're doing. It doesn't have other aspects of the project, influences, references, or personal experiences in the back of its mind, because it doesn't have a mind. Whenever we design something for a game, it's drawn from somewhere, influenced by other things, and filtered through our own experiences as a human. These AI ideas lose ALL of that, turning it into an omega-corporate ‘back of the box’ list of ideas and features”.</p><figure><blockquote><p>I raised the concern that we shouldn't be doing any of this without consent from those actors...</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Sally </strong>is an animator and 3D artist whose most recent video game work was as part of an indie studio working on a VR game. They say that AI tools made deep inroads into life at the studio, beginning with the game’s creative directors and lead designers “playing around with Midjourney” before quickly deciding that they wouldn’t need to hire concept artists, then moving on to declaring that they wouldn’t need to pay <em>anyone at all</em> to create the game’s 2D assets, because those could just be generated by Midjourney then edited in Photoshop.&nbsp;</p><p>Sally began voicing their concerns directly with management when AI moved into the game’s voice work, as bosses began toying with new AI-generated lines trained on work previously performed by voice actors. “I raised the concern that we shouldn't be doing any of this without consent from those actors”, Sally says, “and was met with a very aggressive shutdown response which was that ‘it wasn't going to ship’ and would only be used as an internal tool, so it shouldn't be an issue at all”.</p><p>“This is pretty awful for the voice actors because there’s not really anything they can do if a studio decides to do something like this. [Studios] already have a bunch of their voice work, and often voice actors will just send the entire recording of their lines over at once. So a studio will have multiple takes of each line, and sometimes different variations of the same line, which is kind of a perfect example for something you could feed through AI”.</p><p>Sally was recently laid off from the studio, along with a few of their coworkers, and says that as far as they’re aware the studio’s plan for its next game is to use AI-generated animations trained on motion capture to replace the role of a human animator. “I think the last thing I want to add is just how frustrating it is having AI-generated art in a game that’s about to ship, alongside all the hard work that we human artists put into it. All because one of the directors wanted to cut down on ‘wasting time’ or ‘hiring one other person’”.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>[AI] has been an overwhelmingly negative and demoralizing force in my own personal workplace, no question about it.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Audrey </strong>is a veteran concept artist who has worked both as a freelancer and in-house at studios in the video game industry. With qualifications in both art and game design, they say that over the last few years the emergence of AI tech in the art world “has been an overwhelmingly negative and demoralizing force in my own personal workplace, no question about it”.</p><p>“My own use of AI in my current job has been minimal and against my own wishes and ethics”, they say. “Once in a blue moon I have been given a task that necessitated using AI to make very VERY quick concepts. And when I say ‘necessitated’, I would be told explicitly to use AI and make a ton of images to pick from, and I could then ‘make them look good later’. Depressing doesn’t begin to cover it”.</p><p>Audrey says that their work deadlines are “being completely fucked up as well”, as they will usually need to completely redraw AI-generated images that colleagues in other departments have relied on as placeholder art, which then shifts their own workflow and priorities.&nbsp;</p><p>Audrey says their team’s overall response to AI tech has been “mixed”. “Only a few specific people higher up like to use AI and will use it regularly, while the majority of the team is neutral or completely against using it”, they say. “My own personal opinion was quite vocal. I tried to be clear about my stance on using AI, and so did the rest of the art team. I gave multiple reasons for our company to stop or minimize using it; I’d ask about replacing images that were AI placeholders or if there was a way we could use art already made instead, all of which had mixed results”.</p><figure><blockquote><p>They never hired anyone for the artist position, and are using AI-generated art for their games.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Alfie </strong>is an experienced 2D artist in the video game industry. They recently interviewed at a startup games studio with millions in funding, and came away deeply affected by AI without even working there.</p><p>“This corporate, tech-backed startup near me were looking to hire an artist”, they say. “I went through their entire recruitment process, which took around five weeks, including a trip in person to visit them for several hours. I even took part in a brainstorming session for about an hour, where I ended up coming up with a production plan with some basic schedules. After around three weeks of not hearing anything back from them, they finally got in touch to say they wouldn’t be progressing with my application”.</p><p>Alfie wonders if the studio might have simply been using them for some free art and production consultation. “They never hired anyone for the artist position, and are using AI-generated art for their games”, they say. “There are zero artists on their team”.</p><p>Alfie has since joined a new studio, which <em>had </em>been experimenting with AI-generated imagery a few years back but abandoned its use entirely after finding the results neither accurate nor specific enough for in-game purposes. This studio changed course entirely, and Alfie’s hiring was part of a heavy investment in human art.</p><p>“I guess they realised that AI imagery can't solve all of your problems, and they realise just how precious real human artists are”, Alfie says. “A human artist will research the material properly, with all the nuances of human emotion and logic, and ultimately produce art assets that are historically accurate, game specific and have soul”.</p><figure><blockquote><p>...we have no other choice but to look for mundane work and give up our passion...</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Douglas </strong>is a voice actor whose jobs include recording lines for indie video games, and says their experiences discussing AI with potential employers "feels like screaming into a void". "I've gotten through to small indie teams", they say, "and some publishers have been empathetic and understanding when I try steering them away from AI, since it hurts already-struggling independent artists and actors. But it's always the larger corporations that are eerily silent and flat out seem to ignore anyone who wants to talk about the subject".</p><p>As an example, Douglas says Audible has recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24239903/amazon-audible-audiobook-narrators-ai-generated-voice-clones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">begun trialling a system where actors can submit their recordings to an AI program</a> that will duplicate their voice, then sell it to book authors for their audiobooks. Those actors will then receive a small percentage of any income the AI 'voice' generates, but Douglas can easily see that becoming problematic for the market, with existing (and upcoming) voice actors able to be easily replaced by anyone looking for a "quick and easy" solution.</p><p>I asked Douglas how they and their peers are feeling about this, <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-voice-actor-strike-genshin-impact-destiny-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and other challenges being presented by AI in the voice acting space</a>, and their response was blunt. "Myself and a lot of my fellow voice actors are in the same boat", they say. "None of us feel like submitting our voice to an AI is worth the benefit, because it will destroy a lot of the human emotion we put into our work to help bring a story to life".</p><p>"A lot of us worked tirelessly to make even a fraction of a living doing something we genuinely love, and we're afraid of that being taken away from us, so it's looking like we have no other choice but to look for mundane work and give up our passion".</p><hr><p>These are just some people’s personal experiences, a small snapshot of how AI is affecting the games industry. While <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surveys and numbers</a> can provide some sense of scale, individual experiences can highlight the precise ways AI is encroaching into people’s workplaces and lives, how they feel about it, and how they’re responding.</p><p>As grim as some of these responses feel, I hope there’s at least some small solace to be taken from the fact that so many artists remain firm in their resistance to AI technology that devalues their work, and are championing human creators in the face of it.</p><hr><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/baseball-week-2025" target="_blank">Inside Baseball Week</a>&nbsp;is our annual week of stories about the lesser-known parts of game development, the ins and outs of games journalism, and a peek behind the curtain at Aftermath.

<p><strong>October 02, 2024</strong></p>

<p>It’s been two years since I wrote my first production webservice with <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>.
Two years is not a very long time, but early indicators suggest that the software projects I’ve written with htmx are a much better experience for users, and orders of magnitude easier to maintain, than the software projects they replaced.
They are likely to remain useful for longer than anything else I’ve ever written (so far).
Pretty good!</p>
<p>Like any new tool, especially a tool that got popular <a href="https://risingstars.js.org/2023/en#section-framework">as quickly as htmx</a>, there are differing schools of thought on how best to use it.
My approach—which I believe necessary to achieve the results described above—requires you to internalize something that htmx certainly hints at, but doesn’t enforce: use plain HTML <em>wherever possible</em>.</p>
<p>Once you get the hang of it, htmx starts pushing you in this direction anyway, and you start reaching for htmx less and less.
It requires a mindset shift though, especially if you’re not accustomed to <a href="https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/behavior-belongs-in-html/">building page behavior with HTML features</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-should-we-use-htmx"><a href="#how-should-we-use-htmx" aria-label="Anchor link for: how-should-we-use-htmx">How should we use htmx?</a></h2>
<p>In my opinion, most websites should be using htmx for either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Updates that users would not expect to see on a refresh (or a new page load)</li>
<li>Updates that would <em>also</em> be present on a refresh (or a new page load)</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything else should use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a">regular links</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form">regular forms</a> that do standard, full-page navigations.</p>

<p>Let’s say you’re making a website that shows today’s baseball games, and you want it to update the stats live.
Here’s how I would approach that.</p>
<p>The website’s home page should have all the currently-playing games on it, showing the live score for each one.
Each of those live scoreboards uses htmx to <a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-trigger/#polling">poll the server</a> at regular intervals for updates.
Clicking on the scoreboard title (which is a regular <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> link) takes you to that game’s page, at its own URL.
The game page has not just the score, but the pitch count, the game’s full box score, and so on;
these update with htmx as well.</p>
<p>The idea here is that the website still has a sound URL structure, which is managed by the core browser functionality, while interactivity is carefully layered on top, with targeted updates.
Exactly what merits a targeted update versus a new page depends on what you’re building, but you should have a mental model that distinguishes between them in some capacity.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a lot of the beginner guides suggest that you can get started easily by “upgrading” all your links with <code>hx-boost</code>.
I disagree with this.
While htmx is amazing for targeted page updates, I highly discourage using it to take over <em>all</em> page navigation.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-hx-boost"><a href="#what-is-hx-boost" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-is-hx-boost">What is hx-boost?</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-boost/"><code>hx-boost</code></a> is an attribute that converts a “regular” link into a “boosted” link:</p>
<pre data-lang="html"><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;!-- normal link --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>example.com</span><span>&gt;Example&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>
</span><span>&lt;!-- boosted link --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>example.com </span><span>hx-boost</span><span>=</span><span>true</span><span>&gt;Example&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Instead of doing a full page navigation when the “boosted” link is clicked, htmx will issue an HTTP request to the link’s URL and replace the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> of the page with the content of the response.
In theory, this feels “smoother” because it only repaints part of the page, mimicking the feel of a Single-Page Application (SPA).</p>
<h2 id="what-s-wrong-with-hx-boost"><a href="#what-s-wrong-with-hx-boost" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-s-wrong-with-hx-boost">What’s wrong with hx-boost?</a></h2>
<p>The problems it solves are better solved by other means, and it creates a lot of problems on its own.</p>
<p>Use <code>hx-boost</code> long enough, and something will go wrong.
You’ll click the back button and see only a partial page update;
you’ll refresh the page and it’ll go blank;
another library that you’re using will conk out;
elements will enter or exit the DOM in a way that you did not expect.</p>
<p>From a coding perspective, this is not anyone’s fault—the features promised by <code>hx-boost</code> are impossible.
<code>hx-boost</code> uses the JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API">History API</a>, which exists to let single-page apps (SPAs) hook into session management functionality, most notably the browser’s forward and back buttons.
In practice, this is virtually impossible to get right, and is so annoying to implement that htmx creator Carson Gross made <a href="https://htmx.org/img/memes/javascripthistory.png">a meme</a> about it.</p>
<p>The core problem is that with normal page navigation, each link you click resets the JavaScript environment and triggers a full set of page <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/DOMContentLoaded_event">lifecycle events</a>.
This is a very good thing.
It means that every additional script you include on the page has a standardized way to keep track of what’s happening.
If you replace this process with an ad-hoc, scripting-based navigation, you remove access to that common language for every other library on your page.
You also initiate a long-lived JavaScript environment that is likely to eventually enter a bad state of some kind.</p>
<p>This problem is inherent to SPAs, and it can only be resolved by not writing SPAs.
So don’t use the attribute that turns your htmx site into an SPA.</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a">regular links</a>. <code>hx-boost</code> promises to enhance the experience of a regular link; skip the middleman and just use them.</p>
<p><a href="https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/hard-page-load/">Regular links are a better user experience and developer experience</a>, full stop.</p>

<p>The first time you use <code>hx-boost</code>, it feels magical to have the page update “seamlessly” like that, but you can achieve all the same benefits, without the headaches, using browser features.</p>
<h3 id="send-cache-headers-to-re-use-css-and-js-across-page-loads"><a href="#send-cache-headers-to-re-use-css-and-js-across-page-loads" aria-label="Anchor link for: send-cache-headers-to-re-use-css-and-js-across-page-loads">Send cache headers to re-use CSS and JS across page loads</a></h3>
<p>Basically all static file servers support <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag">ETags</a>.
When the server sends the browser a file, it can also send a unique string that identifies <em>that version</em> of the file.
The next time you try to load that file (after, for instance, navigating to a new page that uses the same CSS), the browser asks your server, “is it still this one?”, and sends that ETag string.
If the file hasn’t changed, the server just responds with a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/304">304 Not Modified</a> header and the browser users its cached version.</p>
<p>In most cases, this is process adds essentially nothing to your load times.
The browser has to talk to the server anyway to get whatever info is on the next page, and it’s <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616#section-8.1">re-using the same TCP connection</a> to do so.
The GET -&gt; 304 back-and-forth is a handful of extra bytes on an already-open socket.</p>
<p>But if you don’t want the browser to even <em>ask</em>, you can do that do by setting a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control#response_directives">cache control header</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s how I load htmx in all the websites where I use it.
We’ll use version 1.9.3 as an example.
I include a script tag like this in the header:</p>
<pre data-lang="html"><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>script </span><span>src</span><span>="</span><span>/htmx-1.9.3.js</span><span>"&gt;&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>When the user loads the page for the very first time, their browser sends the HTTP request <code>GET /htmx-1.9.3.js</code> to my server.
The server will send back something like this in response:</p>
<pre data-lang="http"><code data-lang="http"><span>HTTP/2 200
</span><span>accept-ranges: bytes
</span><span>cache-control: public, max-age=31536000
</span><span>last-modified: Fri, 06 Sep 2024 22:09:43 GMT
</span><span>etag: W/"24b79-191c962d458"
</span><span>content-type: application/javascript; charset=UTF-8
</span></code></pre>
<p>That says: “download htmx 1.9.3 from my server exactly once, and then never ask me for it again for <em>a full calendar year</em>.”
From that point on, for one year, every time that browser loads a page at the same domain that includes htmx 1.9.3, the browser won’t even ask the server for it, it’ll just use the saved version.
If I want to upgrade everyone to a new version, I just change the version number in the URL:</p>
<pre data-lang="html"><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;!-- From this... --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;</span><span>script </span><span>src</span><span>="</span><span>/htmx-1.9.3.js</span><span>"&gt;&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>
</span><span>&lt;!-- ...to this --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;</span><span>script </span><span>src</span><span>="</span><span>/htmx-1.9.4.js</span><span>"&gt;&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>The next time each of my users loads that page, their browsers will see that the page requires a new file it doesn’t have, and ask for the server for it again.</p>
<p>If I don’t even want to include a version number—maybe for a file like <code>stylesheet.css</code>—I can use a URL query.</p>
<pre data-lang="html"><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;!-- The browser will consider these two different files,
</span><span>      but your server will know that they're the same --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;</span><span>link </span><span>rel</span><span>="</span><span>stylesheet</span><span>" </span><span>href</span><span>="</span><span>/stylesheet.css</span><span>"&gt;
</span><span>&lt;</span><span>link </span><span>rel</span><span>="</span><span>stylesheet</span><span>" </span><span>href</span><span>="</span><span>/stylesheet.css?id=1</span><span>"&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Again, basically every static file server supports this pattern.</p>

<p>This website (<a href="https://unplannedobsolescence.com/">unplannedobsolescence.com</a>) uses exclusively regular links, and if you click around up top you’ll see that the header largely stays in place.
This happens automatically now, for same-origin links to pages with the same structure and stylesheets (like I showed you above).</p>
<p>Here’s the Chrome team <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/paint-holding">announcing this feature</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try Paint Holding in Chrome Canary (Chrome 76) and let us know what you think. Developers shouldn’t have to worry about making any modifications to their pages to take advantage of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chrome 76 came out four years ago, in 2019.
Everyone who built their website with regular links got a significant, free performance upgrade to their website pushed out to billions of people;
the same is not true for everyone who tried to replace that functionality with JavaScript.</p>

<p>Using standard HTML features allows the browser to optimize performance and UX in ways that JavaScript is categorically incapable of.
Every time the browser updates it is getting better at loading, parsing, and rendering webpages.
Page history, loading bars, the back button, the cancel button, the URL bar, etc., all work correctly, by default, every time, on every browser.</p>

<p>htmx was created during a period in which it seemed like SPAs were the inevitable future of web development.
To compete in that environment, it had to demonstrate that it could replicate what most people considered to be the killer feature of SPAs: not repainting the whole page.
If this was ever necessary—I’m skeptical—it’s sure not necessary anymore.</p>
<p>Now that htmx has proven itself in the mindshare ecosystem, and developers are starting to trust multi-page websites again, I think the time has come to make the harder, but ultimately more impactful case: HTML and HTTP have the features required to build the vast, vast majority of website functionality; they’re easier to use than the scripting alternatives, and they last longer with much less maintenance.</p>

<p>Building good websites requires dropping the sugar high of <code>hx-boost</code> and saying “here’s how to use a cache header.”</p>
<h2 id="is-there-ever-a-time-i-should-use-htmx-to-make-an-spa"><a href="#is-there-ever-a-time-i-should-use-htmx-to-make-an-spa" aria-label="Anchor link for: is-there-ever-a-time-i-should-use-htmx-to-make-an-spa">Is there ever a time I should use htmx to make an SPA?</a></h2>
<p>My friend <a href="https://aramzs.xyz/">Aram</a> made a website called <a href="https://songobsessed.com/">Song Obsessed</a> that has a persistent music player which holds its state even as you navigate around the site.
<code>hx-boost</code> is a good fit for this because it allows you to construct your website as a series of URLs; you can just slap <code>hx-boost</code> on everything and, with a little tweaking, you can get htmx to leave the music player alone while replacing the rest of the page.
You still lost the reliability inherent in the hard page load, but you get genuinely novel functionality in exchange, which is a good trade in this case.
Until HTML has an API to keep live content persistent across page navigations, some SPA functionality is required to make that happen.</p>
<p>SPAs are an <em>advanced</em> tool that the industry deceptively marketed as a simple one.
Aram is a highly experienced web developer who’s using <code>hx-boost</code> to push the boundaries of what’s possible with page navigations;
Most people, who just want to add a little interactivity to their webpage, should <a href="https://grugbrain.dev/#grug-on-complexity">stick with the simplest tool available</a>: a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a">regular link</a>.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Carson Gross his for feedback on a draft of this article. Comments available on <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/1uv7e4/less_htmx_is_more">lobste.rs</a></em></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://alexanderpetros.com/triptych/">Triptych</a>—the HTML proposals that Carson and I are working on—would render htmx obsolete for the type of website I describe here.
More advanced htmx features, like the ones used to great effect by <a href="https://david.guillot.me/en/posts/tech/following-up-mother-of-all-htmx-demos/">David Guillot and Contexte</a>, will still require htmx for the foreseeable future.</li>
<li>To add PUT (and DELETE) support to “regular” forms with htmx, add <a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-put/"><code>hx-put</code></a> to the form, and then have the server respond with status code 200 and an <a href="https://htmx.org/headers/hx-redirect/"><code>HX-Redirect</code></a> header;
instead of doing partial page replacement, htmx will tell the browser to do a full-page navigation.
This mimics the POST-Redirect-GET pattern, but uses a header instead of a 303 response.</li>
<li>Ideally, htmx would be able to intercept a normal 303 response and use the <code>location</code> header, instead of a custom header, but because of limitations in the fetch API (<code>manual</code> redirects <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RequestInit#redirect">hide all the headers</a>), it can’t.
I don’t totally understand what security purpose this serves, to be honest, but it’s a bit of a shame, because it means that <a href="https://github.com/alexpetros/triptych?tab=readme-ov-file#limitations">you can’t make a proper polyfill</a> for PUT and DELETE forms.</li>
<li>Both <a href="https://dev.37signals.com/a-happier-happy-path-in-turbo-with-morphing/">turbo</a> and <a href="https://data-star.dev/essays/another_dependency#fn:1">datastar</a> use Carson’s <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/idiomorph">idiomorph</a> algorithm to merge updates into the page, but Carson ended up rejecting idiomorph as the default merging algorithm for htmx, because it was too complicated—even though he’s the one who created it in the first place!
The default <a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap/">htmx swap strategy</a> is to just wipe away what’s inside the <code>innerHTML</code> and replace it with the response—not unlike how the default page navigation is to wipe away the environment and give you a fresh one.

            Complex neural circuits likely arose independently in birds and mammals, suggesting that vertebrates evolved intelligence multiple times.        </p>
        
    </div><div>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Humans tend to put our own intelligence on a pedestal. Our brains can do math, employ logic, explore abstractions and think critically. But we can’t claim a monopoly on thought. Among a variety of nonhuman species known to display intelligent behavior, birds have been shown time and again to have advanced cognitive abilities. <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/ravens-humans-and-apes-can-plan-future">Ravens plan</a> for the future, <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/animals-can-count-and-use-zero-how-far-does-their-number-sense-go-20210809/">crows count</a> and <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/news/unique-beak-evolved-with-tool-use-in-new-caledonian-crow/">use tools</a>, <a href="https://www.audubon.org/news/wild-cockatoos-and-humans-compete-rubbish-prize-potential-arms-race">cockatoos open and pillage</a> booby-trapped garbage cans, and <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/mind/2019/chickadee-memory-food">chickadees keep track</a> of tens of thousands of seeds cached across a landscape. Notably, birds achieve such feats with brains that look completely different from ours: They’re smaller and lack the highly organized structures that scientists associate with mammalian intelligence.</p>
<p>“A bird with a 10-gram brain is doing pretty much the same as a chimp with a 400-gram brain,” said <a href="https://hahn-institute.de/en/research/group/biopsychology-guentuerkuen">Onur Güntürkün</a>, who studies brain structures at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. “How is it possible?”</p>
<p>Researchers have long debated about the relationship between avian and mammalian intelligences. One possibility is that intelligence in vertebrates — animals with backbones, including mammals and birds — evolved once. In that case, both groups would have inherited the complex neural pathways that support cognition from a common ancestor: a lizardlike creature that lived 320 million years ago, when Earth’s continents were squished into one landmass. The other possibility is that the kinds of neural circuits that support vertebrate intelligence evolved independently in birds and mammals.</p>
<p>It’s hard to track down which path evolution took, given that any trace of the ancient ancestor’s actual brain vanished in a geological blink. So biologists have taken other approaches — such as comparing brain structures in adult and developing animals today — to piece together how this kind of neurobiological complexity might have emerged.</p>
<p>A series of studies <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adv2609">published in <em>Science</em></a> in February 2025 provides the best evidence yet that birds and mammals did not inherit the neural pathways that generate intelligence from a common ancestor, but rather evolved them independently. This suggests that vertebrate intelligence arose not once, but multiple times. Still, their neural complexity didn’t evolve in wildly different directions: Avian and mammalian brains display surprisingly similar circuits, the studies found.</p>
<p>“It’s a milestone in the quest to understand and to integrate the different ideas about the evolution” of vertebrate intelligence, said Güntürkün, who was not involved in the new research.</p>
</div>
    </div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>The findings emerge in a world enraptured by artificial forms of intelligence, and they could teach us something about how complex circuits in our own brains evolved. Perhaps most importantly, they could help us step “away from the idea that we are the best creatures in the world,” said <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00132293">Niklas Kempynck</a>, a graduate student at KU Leuven who led one of the studies. “We are not this optimal solution to intelligence.”</p>
<p>Birds got there too, on their own.</p>
<h2><strong>Pecking Disorder </strong></h2>
<p>For the first half of the 20th century, neuroanatomists assumed that birds were simply not that smart. The creatures lack anything resembling a neocortex — the highly ordered outermost structure in the brains of humans and other mammals where language, communication and reasoning reside. The neocortex is organized into six layers of neurons, which receive sensory information from other parts of the brain, process it and send it out to regions that determine our behavior and reactions.</p>

<p>“For the longest time, it was thought that this is the center of cognition, and you need this kind of anatomy to develop advanced cognitive abilities,” said <a href="https://home.kaessmannlab.org/members">Bastienne Zaremba</a>, a postdoctoral researcher studying the evolution of the brain at Heidelberg University.</p>
<p>Rather than neat layers, birds have “unspecified balls of neurons without landmarks or distinctions,” said <a href="https://www.achucarro.org/people/fernando-garcia-moreno/">Fernando García-Moreno</a>, a neurobiologist at the Achucarro Basque Center for Neuroscience in Spain. These structures compelled neuroanatomists a century ago to suggest that much of bird behavior is reflexive, and not driven by learning and decision-making. This “implies that what a mammal can learn easily, a bird will never learn,” Güntürkün said.</p>
<p>The conventional thinking started to change in the 1960s when Harvey Karten, a young neuroanatomist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, mapped and compared brain circuits in mammals and pigeons, and later in owls, chickens and other birds. What he found was a surprise: The brain regions thought to be involved only in reflexive movements were built from neural circuits — networks of interconnected neurons — that resembled those found in the mammalian neocortex. This region in the bird brain, the dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR), seemed to be comparable to a neocortex; it just didn’t look like it.</p>
<p>In 1969, Karten wrote a “very influential paper that completely changed the discussion in the field,” said <a href="https://www.tosches-lab.com/">Maria Tosches</a>, who studies vertebrate brain development at Columbia University. “His work was really revolutionary.” He concluded that because avian and mammalian circuits are similar, they were <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1969.tb20442.x">inherited from a common ancestor</a>. That thinking dominated the field for decades, said Güntürkün, a former postdoc in Karten’s lab. It “sparked quite a lot of interest in the bird brain.”</p>

<p>A few decades later, Luis Puelles, an anatomist at the University of Murcia in Spain, drew the opposite conclusion to Karten. By comparing embryos at various stages of development, he found that the mammalian neocortex and the avian DVR developed from distinct areas of the embryo’s pallium — a brain region shared by all vertebrates. He concluded that the structures must have evolved independently</p>
<p>Karten and Puelles were “giving completely different answers to this big question,” Tosches said. The debate continued for decades. During this time, biologists also began to appreciate bird intelligence, starting with their studies of Alex, an African gray parrot who could count and identify objects. They realized just how smart birds could be.</p>
<p>However, neither group seemed to want to resolve the discrepancy between their two theories of how vertebrate palliums evolved, according to García-Moreno. “No, they kept working on their own method,” he said. One camp continued to compare the circuitry in adult vertebrate brains; the other focused on embryonic development.</p>
<p>In the new studies, he said, “we tried to put everything together.”</p>
<h2><strong>Same but Not the Same</strong></h2>
<p>Two new studies, which were conducted by independent teams of researchers, relied on the same powerful tool for identifying cell types, known as single-cell RNA sequencing. This technique lets researchers compare neuronal circuits, as Karten did, not only in adult brains but all the way through embryonic development, following Puelles. In this way, they could see where the cells started growing in the embryo and where they ended up in the mature animal&nbsp;— a developmental journey that can reveal evolutionary pathways.</p>
<p>For their study, García-Moreno and his team wanted to watch how brain circuitry develops. Using RNA sequencing and other techniques, they tracked cells in the palliums of chickens, mice and geckos at various embryonic stages to time-stamp when different types of neurons were generated and where they matured.</p>
<p>They found that the mature circuits <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adp3411">looked remarkably alike across animals</a>, just as Karten and others had noted, but they were built differently, as Puelles had found. The circuits that composed the mammalian neocortex and the avian DVR developed at different times, in different orders and in different regions of the brain.</p>
</div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>At the same time, García-Moreno was collaborating with Zaremba and her colleagues at Heidelberg University. Using RNA sequencing, they created “the most comprehensive atlas of the bird pallium that we have,” said Tosches, who wrote <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adv2609">a related perspective piece</a>&nbsp;published in <em>Science</em>. By comparing the bird pallium to lizard and mouse palliums, they also found that the neocortex and DVR were <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adp5182">built with similar circuitry</a> — however, the neurons that composed those neural circuits were distinct.</p>
<p>“How we end up with similar circuitry was more flexible than I would have expected,” Zaremba said. “You can build the same circuits from different cell types.”</p>
<p>Zaremba and her team also found that in the bird pallium, neurons that start development in different regions can mature into the same type of neuron in the adult. This pushed against previous views, which held that distinct regions of the embryo must generate different types of neurons.</p>

<p>In mammals, brain development follows an intuitive path: The cells in the embryo’s amygdala region at the start of development end up in the adult amygdala. The cells in the embryo’s cortex region end up in the adult cortex. But in birds, “there is a fantastic reorganization of the forebrain,” Güntürkün said, that is “nothing that we had expected.”</p>
<p>Taken together, the studies provide the clearest evidence yet that birds and mammals independently evolved brain regions for complex cognition. They also echo <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/gene-expression-in-neurons-solves-a-brain-evolution-puzzle-20230214/">previous research from Tosches’ lab</a>, which found that the mammalian neocortex evolved independently from the reptile DVR.</p>
<p>Still, it seems likely there was some inheritance from a common ancestor. In a third study that used deep learning, Kempynck and his co-author Nikolai Hecker found that mice, chickens and humans <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adp3957">share some stretches of DNA</a> that influence the development of the neocortex or DVR, suggesting that similar genetic tools are at work in both types of animals. And as previous studies had suggested, the research groups found that inhibitory neurons, or those that silence and modulate neural signals, were conserved across birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The findings haven’t completely resolved Karten and Puelles’ debate, however. Whose ideas were closer to the truth? Tosches said that Puelles was right, while Güntürkün thought the findings better reflect Karten’s ideas, though would partly please Puelles. García-Moreno split the difference: “Both of them were right; none of them was wrong,” he said.</p>
<h2><strong>How To Build Intelligence</strong></h2>

<p>Intelligence doesn’t come with an instruction manual. It is hard to define, there are no ideal steps toward it, and it doesn’t have an optimal design, Tosches said. Innovations can happen throughout an animal’s biology, whether in new genes and their regulation, or in new neuron types, circuits and brain regions. But similar innovations can evolve multiple times independently — a phenomenon known as convergent evolution — and this is seen across life.</p>
<p>“One of the reasons I kind of like these papers is that they really highlight a lot of differences,” said <a href="https://mcd.ucsc.edu/faculty/colquitt.html">Bradley Colquitt</a>, a molecular neuroscientist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “It allows you to say: What are the different neural solutions that these organisms have come up with to solve similar problems of living in a complex world and being able to adapt in a rapidly changing terrestrial environment?”</p>
<p>Octopuses and squids, independently of mammals, evolved camera-like eyes. Birds, bats and insects all took to the skies on their own. Ancient people in Egypt and South America independently built pyramids — the most structurally efficient shape that will stand the test of time, García-Moreno said: “If they make a tower, it will fall. If they make a wall, it won’t work.”</p>
<p>Similarly, “there’s limited degrees of freedom into which you can generate an intelligent brain, at least within vertebrates,” Tosches said. Drift outside the realm of vertebrates, however, and you can generate an intelligent brain in much weirder ways — from our perspective, anyway. “It’s a wild west,” she said. Octopuses, for example, “evolved intelligence in a way that’s completely independent.” Their cognitive structures look nothing like ours, except that they’re built from the same broad type of cell: the neuron. Yet octopuses have been caught performing incredible feats such as escaping aquarium tanks, solving puzzles, unscrewing jar lids and carrying shells as shields.</p>
        
        
<p>It would be exciting to figure out how octopuses evolved intelligence using really divergent neural structures, Colquitt said. That way, it might be possible to pinpoint any absolute constraints on evolving intelligence across all animal species, not just vertebrates.</p>
<p>Such findings could eventually reveal shared features of various intelligences, Zaremba said. What are the building blocks of a brain that can think critically, use tools or form abstract ideas? That understanding could help in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence — and help improve our artificial intelligence. For example, the way we currently think about using insights from evolution to improve AI is very anthropocentric. “I would be really curious to see if we can build like artificial intelligence from a bird perspective,” Kempynck said. “How does a bird think? Can we mimic that?”</p>

        IBM spent US&nbsp;$5&nbsp;billion to build the System/360, introduced in 1964. These 9-track magnetic tape drives were among the S/360’s 150-product line.
    </p><div data-headline="Building the System/360 Mainframe Nearly Destroyed IBM"><p><strong>A short list of the most transformative products</strong> of the past century and a half would include the lightbulb, Ford’s Model T—and the <a href="https://ethw.org/IBM_System/360">IBM System/360</a>. This <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/mainframe">mainframe</a> series forever changed the computer industry and revolutionized how businesses and governments worked, enhancing productivity and making countless new tasks possible.</p><p>In the years leading up to its 7 April 1964 launch, however, the 360 was one of the scariest dramas in American business. It took a nearly fanatical commitment at all levels of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a> to bring forth this remarkable collection of machines and software. While the technological innovations that went into the S/360 were important, how they were created and deployed bordered on disaster. The company experienced what <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c41e/a89f526b1b54036320c7e15067122c4ff794.pdf">science policy expert Keith Pavitt called “tribal warfare”</a>: people clashing and collaborating in a rapidly growing company with unstable, and in some instances unknown, technologies, as uncertainty and ambiguity dogged all the protagonists.</p><p>Ultimately, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ibm">IBM</a> was big and diverse enough in talent, staffing, financing, and materiel to succeed. In an almost entrepreneurial fashion, it took advantage of emerging technologies, no matter where they were located within the enterprise. In hindsight, it seemed a sloppy and ill-advised endeavor, chaotic in execution and yet brilliantly successful. We live in an age that celebrates innovation, so examining cases of how innovation is done can only illuminate our understanding of the process.</p><p><strong>By the end of the 1950s,</strong> computer users faced a seemingly intractable problem. Had it not been solved, it would have prevented computers from becoming widespread, and any thoughts of living in an Information Age would have been fiction.</p><p><img alt="IBM 1401" data-rm-shortcode-id="86125ce55d2e371a1f33b289111d3f3e" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/ibm-1401.jpg?id=25588279&amp;width=980" height="594" id="98290" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/ibm-1401.jpg?id=25588279&amp;width=980" width="1240"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The S/360 was designed to replace IBM’s 1401 mainframe, which was popular but couldn’t be expanded or upgraded.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Photo: IBM</small></p><p>Organizations were acquiring computers in great numbers, automating many of the old punch card operations and doing more with data processing. The popularity of the IBM 1401 illustrates the rapid adoption of computing. Over 12,000 of these systems were sold from their introduction in 1959 to 1971, when IBM retired the line.</p><p>With the 1401 so dominating the computer business, any problems with it were serious. One of them was that the 1401 was too small.</p><p>Users found these machines so useful that they kept piling more work on them, reaching the system’s capacity. They then had three options: move to a bigger IBM system, such as an IBM 7000, install a competitor’s system, or acquire more 1401s. None of these options was attractive. To change to a bigger system required rewriting software, since the old software would not work on a different type of machine. The cost of rewriting could easily exceed the financial benefits of moving to a bigger machine. Such a change also called for retraining staff or hiring new staff familiar with the new system. Adding more units of the same system was equally unattractive because each unit required duplicate staff, equipment, and maintenance of hardware and software. Customers wanted systems that were “upgradable” or “compatible,” such that as their needs grew, they could bring in larger machines but still run the same software and peripheral equipment. In the 1950s and early 1960s, it was a wish, and for vendors an aspiration.</p><p>IBM had worse problems than its customers did. The 1401s were proving so popular that engineers in Endicott, N.Y., which had developed the system, resisted attempts by their counterparts in Poughkeepsie to build larger computers, leading to growing rivalry between the two groups. As one engineer recalled, “So intense was it that sometimes it seemed to exceed the rivalry with external competitors.” Systems made by Poughkeepsie would not run programs written for the 1400 series. Customers wanting to move from the smaller 1400s to the larger Poughkeepsie machines put increasing pressure on IBM to provide compatibility. Senior management had to contend with the expenses of sustaining R&amp;D for a half-dozen incompatible product lines and training IBMers to sell and maintain so many systems.</p><p>Consensus grew that IBM needed to get down to one system to simplify production, reduce the cost of R&amp;D, and be more competitive against a growing array of rivals. If customers had to upgrade in the early 1960s, they could just as easily move to a competitor’s machine, since they would have to rewrite their software anyway.</p><p>The power of compatibility was demonstrated in the fall of 1960, when IBM introduced the more powerful 1410 to replace the 1401. Software and peripheral equipment for the 1401 worked with the newer machine. Customers and IBM sales loved that fact. Poughkeepsie’s engineers were close to completing work on a set of four computers known as the 8000s that were compatible with the 7000s.</p><p><img alt="T.

IBM’s CEO at the time, <a href="https://history.computer.org/pioneers/watson-jr.html">Thomas J. Watson Jr.</a>, later described what happened: “He did it by applying a management technique called ‘abrasive interaction.’ This means forcing people to swap sides: taking the top engineer from the small-computer division and making him boss of the best development team in the large-computer division. A lot of people thought this made about as much sense as electing Khrushchev president.”</p><p>Learson replaced the Poughkeepsie manager in charge of the 8000 project with Bob O. Evans, who had served as the engineering manager for the 1401 and 1410. Evans favored compatibility across all future products. After 90 days in his new role, Evans recommended that work on the 8000s be stopped and that both sites begin working “to develop a total cohesive product line.” He also proposed a bold new base technology for all future systems, called <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.87.4832&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Solid Logic Technology (SLT)</a>, to make IBM’s machines more competitive.</p><p><a href="https://ethw.org/Frederick_P._Brooks,_Jr">Frederick P.

In December 1961, the group presented its technical recommendations.</p><p>Their report called for five compatible computers, labeled <em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/processors">processors</a></em> (defined as the computer, its memory, and channels to connect to peripheral equipment). The software and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/peripherals">peripherals</a> for one processor were to work with all other processors. The plan called for using standard hardware and software interfaces between computers and peripherals, such as between <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/disk-drives">disk drives</a> and tape drives connecting to computers, so that the peripherals did not have to be swapped out when a new processor was installed. The recommendations became the basis for the System/360.</p><p>Because so much would be new, the processors would not be compatible with IBM’s existing products. That was an enormously important point. Customers moving to the new IBM machines would have to rewrite existing software just once to get on the path of the new system.</p><p>Then, IBM got a lucky break. As one engineer wrote, “Almost miraculously [Evans’s] vision of the new product line was saved by a last-minute technical accomplishment. In mid-1963, engineers in the Poughkeepsie and Endicott laboratories had begun exploring the possibility of adding special microcode to the control stores of computers to improve their performance when simulating earlier IBM computers.” This function would allow 1401 software to run in the two smaller models of the proposed new system, only faster. Sales got on board, and its executives began pressuring R&amp;D and manufacturing management for early introduction of the new processors.</p><p>Watson recognized what was at stake, as he recalled in his memoirs:</p><blockquote>
  From the beginning we faced two risks, either of which was enough to keep us awake at night. First there was the task of coordinating the hardware and software design work for the new line. We had engineering teams all over America and Europe working simultaneously on six new processors and dozens of new peripherals…but in the end all of this hardware would have to plug together. The software was a bigger hurdle still. In order for System/360 to have a common personality, hundreds of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/programmers">programmers</a> had to write millions of lines of computer code. Nobody had ever tackled that complex a programming job, and the engineers were under great pressure to get it done. 
</blockquote><p>A second set of problems involved manufacturing the electronic components for the new systems. The electronics industry was starting to work on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/integrated-circuits">integrated circuits</a>, and the new computers were going to be filled with these new components. To be independent, IBM had to make its own. It proved to be an expensive proposition.</p><p>Eventually, the corporate management committee, including Watson and the board of directors, sucked in a deep breath and approved the SPREAD recommendations. IBM was off to the races in the wildest ride of its history.</p><p><strong>IBM could not hide what was going on.</strong> New employees flocked to Endicott, Poughkeepsie, and other labs and plants. Customers heard rumors, the computer press was speculating, and executives at <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ge">GE</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/honeywell">Honeywell</a>, Sperry Univac, and elsewhere were trying to anticipate what IBM would do.</p><p>At IBM, nobody seemed satisfied with progress on the new system. Engineering, manufacturing, sales, and corporate staff were in many cases working 100-hour weeks. Engineers moved cots into their offices. When Watson stopped in to see how programming was going, an engineer yelled at him to get out so he could work. The chairman of IBM beat a hasty retreat.</p><p><img alt="Left, sign in Grand Central terminal announcing train to take reporters to Poughkeepsie for the 360 press event. Right, Thoma J.

Watson Jr. officially unveiled the System/360.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Photos: IBM</small></p><p>It all became public at noon eastern time in the United States on 7 April 1964. Over 100,000 customers, reporters, and technologists met in 165 U.S. cities, while others gathered around the world over the next few days to hear the news. As Watson declared at a press conference in Poughkeepsie, it was “the most important product announcement in the company’s history.”</p><p><img alt="IBM 2311 disk drive" data-rm-shortcode-id="accf8a0dfe1ef9043a12820d0c5c1b31" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/ibm-2311-disk-drive.jpg?id=25588283&amp;width=980" height="929" id="ba126" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/ibm-2311-disk-drive.jpg?id=25588283&amp;width=980" width="620"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Among the System/360’s 44 peripherals was the 2311 disk storage drive. Each removable disk pack stored 7.25 megabytes.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Photo: Mark Richards/Computer History Museum</small></p><p>On that day, IBM introduced a mind-boggling 150 new products: 6 computers; 44 peripherals, including tape drives, disk drives, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/printers">printers</a>, and control units; and a promise to provide the software necessary to make everything work together. The press packet was an inch thick, and manuals describing all the machines, components, software, and their installation and operation filled more than 50 linear feet.</p><p>The central feature of the System/360 was, of course, its compatibility. A growing data center could install a small 360 computer and later upgrade to a larger one without rewriting software or replacing peripheral equipment. Once familiar with the system, one did not have to learn a great deal more to handle an upgrade. The name 360 was chosen to suggest the idea of 360 degrees, covering everything.</p><p>In the first month following the S/360 announcement, customers worldwide ordered over 100,000 systems. To put that number in perspective, in that same year in the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/united-kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, all of Western Europe, the United States, and Japan, there were slightly more than 20,000 computers of any kind installed. The first deliveries of the smaller machines were promised for the third quarter of 1965, and deliveries of the larger ones in the first quarter of 1966. The delay between announcement and shipping date gave customers time to decide which models to acquire, get them approved and budgeted, plan on where to house them, train staff, complete software remediation, and so forth. With the April announcement, IBM bought itself two years to make good on its promises and knock competitors back on their heels.</p><p><strong>From 7 April</strong> to when the company started delivering machines to customers, IBM entered the most dangerous, intense, and challenging era of its history. The company spent US $5 billion (about $40 billion today) to develop the System/360, which at the time was more than IBM made in a year, and it would eventually hire more than 70,000 new workers. Every IBMer believed that failure meant the death of IBM.</p><p>As Watson later recalled, “Not all of the equipment on display [on 7 April] was real; some units were just mockups made of wood. We explained that to our guests, so there was no deception. But it was a dangerous cutting of corners—not the way I think business ought to be done—and an uncomfortable reminder to me of how far we had to go before we could call the program a success.”</p><p>Watson assigned his brother, Arthur, to manage engineering and manufacturing going forward. Learson would run sales for the new system, “twisting the tails of our salesmen.” Tom Watson Jr. thought Learson had the more difficult task. The risk of customers converting to someone else’s machines rather than to the S/360 greatly concerned Watson.</p><p><img alt="Manufacturing in Poughkeepsie" data-rm-shortcode-id="161cd1b24e220f10c54e50964f57a000" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/manufacturing-in-poughkeepsie.jpg?id=25588284&amp;width=980" height="930" id="1ea91" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/manufacturing-in-poughkeepsie.jpg?id=25588284&amp;width=980" width="1240"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">IBM promised to begin delivering the first S/360 machines in the third quarter of 1965.

One production manager said it could not be done and was replaced. Quality declined. Some of the electronic circuits within an SLT, for example, were not complete, so <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electrons">electrons</a> could not go where they were supposed to. By the end of the year, the quality control department had impounded 25 percent of all SLT modules, bringing production to a halt.</p><p><img alt="System 360 SLT held within a few fingers." data-rm-shortcode-id="d05052a761c06073e78ab09ab9426283" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/system-360-slt-held-within-a-few-fingers.jpg?id=25588285&amp;width=980" height="1240" id="35a40" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/system-360-slt-held-within-a-few-fingers.jpg?id=25588285&amp;width=980" width="1240"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">With the S/360, IBM introduced its solid logic technology (SLT), a precursor to integrated circuits.

IBM opened a new plant in East Fishkill, just south of Poughkeepsie, which made more semiconductor devices than all other manufacturers worldwide combined. Production also expanded to new facilities in Burlington, Vt., and in Corbeil-Essonnes, France.</p><p>To resolve manufacturing problems with the ferrite-core memories, IBM set up a plant in Boulder, Colo., in 1965. But it took the craftsmanship of workers in Japan to get the production of memories up to the required amounts and quality.</p><p><img alt="IBM System 360 ferrite-core memory." data-rm-shortcode-id="5ef6aa819c7095d3b4fd4732ca8beeba" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/ibm-system-360-ferrite-core-memory.jpg?id=25588286&amp;width=980" height="930" id="b0e43" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/ibm-system-360-ferrite-core-memory.jpg?id=25588286&amp;width=980" width="1240"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The S/360’s ferrite-core memory also proved extremely tricky to manufacture.

Arthur Watson had some experience managing IBM’s small <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/factories">factories</a> outside the United States but none with resolving engineering problems, let alone massive global problems in development and manufacturing. He was out of his league, and his brother challenged him to resolve the problems. Meanwhile, Learson and his sales teams wanted additional improvements to the product line. Relations between Learson and Arthur completely deteriorated. In October 1964, IBM announced significant delays in shipping products.</p><p>Tom removed Arthur from his job and turned over his responsibilities to Learson, who in turn brought in four engineering managers to punch through the problems. Nicknamed the “four horsemen,” they had full authority worldwide for getting the S/360 manufactured and delivered to customers. Their collection of problems, one of the managers noted later, was “an absolute nightmare,” “a gray blur of 24-hour days, seven days a week—never being home.” And yet, in five months, they had worked out enough of the problems to start meeting delivery dates. In January 1966, Learson became president of IBM.</p><p><img alt="The \u201cfour horseman\u201d were Henry E. Cooley, Clarence E. Frizzell, John W.

His career was broken, and he retired in 1970. In his memoirs, Tom Watson Jr. admitted to being in a nearly continuous panic from 1964 to 1966 and deeply regretted his treatment of Arthur. “I felt nothing but shame and frustrations at the way I’d treated him…. As it was, we remade the computer industry with the System/360, and objectively it was the greatest triumph of my business career. But whenever I look back on it, I think about my brother I injured.”</p><p><strong>Software problems also slowed production</strong> of the 360. The <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/software-development">software development</a> staff was described as being in “disarray” as early as 1963. The <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/operating-system">operating system</a>, called OS/360, struggled to run more than one job at a time, which was essential to making the S/360 fast and productive. Other problems surfaced with telecommunications and with application programs. Programming support became another contentious issue.</p><p>Fred Brooks volunteered to help, and IBM added 1,000 people to the operating system project, costing the company more for software in one year than had been planned for the entire development of the S/360 system. But throwing more programmers at the project did not help. Based on the S/360 experience, Brooks would later expand on that theme in <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em> (Addison-Wesley, 1975), still one of the most widely read books on computing. The software would take years to complete, but in the end it worked well enough to keep the shipping delay to one month.</p><p><img alt="Delivery of the IBM System/360 in to Tokai Bank Japan." data-rm-shortcode-id="649276b9ee9b3b38b3e180081613f1b9" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/delivery-of-the-ibm-system-360-in-to-tokai-bank-japan.jpg?id=25588288&amp;width=980" height="665" id="230f2" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/delivery-of-the-ibm-system-360-in-to-tokai-bank-japan.jpg?id=25588288&amp;width=980" width="1240"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">A System/360 arrives at Tokai Bank in Japan. Demand for computing grew enormously in the years following the S/360’s launch.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Photo: IBM</small></p><p>Despite the costs and anxiety, in 1965—the year IBM had committed to shipping the first units to customers—it managed “by some miracle” (Watson’s words) to deliver hundreds of medium-size S/360s. Their quality did not always match the original design specifications. Shortages of parts, other parts that did not work, and software filled with bugs spread to many countries. Almost every initial customer encountered problems.</p><p>Branch offices were hiring systems engineers to help. SEs were college graduates, usually with technical degrees, who knew how to debug software and assisted the sales force in selling and supporting computers. The SEs heroically tackled S/360’s software problems, while field engineers, who installed equipment, fixed hardware problems. Salesmen calmed their customers, while branch managers worked to keep their staffs motivated and focused.</p><p>And despite the many problems, “customers were still ordering 360s faster than we could build them,” Watson recalled, forcing delivery dates out as much as three years. By the end of 1966, customers had taken delivery of nine models of the S/360, for a total of 7,700.</p><p><strong>IBM’s competitors responded.</strong> Burroughs, GE, Honeywell, NCR, and Sperry Rand, operating largely in the United States, CII in France, and ICT (later ICI) in Great Britain introduced systems compatible with one another’s machines, but not compatible with IBM’s. A second, smaller group chose to manufacture machines that were compatible with IBM’s, including RCA and others in Europe and Japan, relying on RCA’s licenses.</p><p><img alt="1968.

In other words, IBM’s S/360 increased overall demand for computing so massively that it raised all boats. The industry’s annual growth in the second half of the 1960s was in double digits year over year, as many thousands of organizations expanded their use of computers. Demand for computing grew because of the technological innovations brought forth by IBM, but also because users were accumulating enough experience to understand a computer’s value in driving down costs and performing new functions.</p><p>IBM also grew, more than doubling from 127,000 employees worldwide in 1962 to 265,000 by the end of 1971. Revenue rose from $3.2 billion in 1964 to $8.2 billion in 1971.</p><p><img alt="Fisheye view of the IBM System 360" data-rm-shortcode-id="9575ea4bbcd9562577dd7834054669c2" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/fisheye-view-of-the-ibm-system-360.jpg?id=25588290&amp;width=980" height="1240" id="5b214" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/fisheye-view-of-the-ibm-system-360.jpg?id=25588290&amp;width=980" width="1240"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The S/360 reinforced IBM’s domination of the global computer business.

Thousands of programmers only knew how to use software that ran on S/360s. Additional thousands of data-processing personnel had worked only with IBM equipment, including keypunch machines, printers, tape drives, disk drives, and software, which in many instances took years to master. By the early 1970s the computing space was largely an IBM world on both sides of the Atlantic, in the emerging markets in Latin America, and in Japan.</p><p>Years later, when asked whether IBM would ever engage in such a massive project again, one executive barked out, “Hell no, never again.” Watson tilted toward a similar reaction. Commenting in 1966, he said, “At our size, we can’t go 100 percent with anything new again,” meaning anything that big. After the 360, Watson made it a policy “never to announce a new technology which will require us to devote more than 25 percent of our production to that technology.”</p><p>The generation that brought out the S/360 remained unique in the company, a special clan bonded ferociously to IBM. Careers had been made and broken, personal lives and marriages upended. IBMers did not know at the time how extensively their products would change the world, but we do.</p><p><img alt="Left, IBM: The Rise and Fall and Reinvention of a Global Icon. Right: Author James W.

Sushil Prasad, a 35-year-old technician, wipes the sweat off his brow as he carefully pieces together the guts of an old laptop. It is a daily ritual — resurrecting machines by stitching together motherboards, screens, and batteries scavenged from other trashed older laptops and e-waste — to create functional, low-cost devices.</p><div><p>“India has always had a repair culture … but companies are pushing planned obsolescence”</p></div><p>“Right now, there is a huge demand for such ‘hybrid’ laptops,” Prasad says, his hands swapping out a damaged motherboard. “Most people don’t care about having the latest model; they just want something that works and won’t break the bank.”</p><div><div><p><a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100" data-pswp-height="1800" data-pswp-width="2700" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="One of the streets where laptops are repaired at Nehru Place." data-chromatic="ignore" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 700px" srcset="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400 2400w" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></p></div><p><figcaption><em>One of the streets where laptops are repaired at Nehru Place. </em></figcaption></p></div><div><p>Across India, in metro markets from Delhi’s Nehru Place to Mumbai’s Lamington Road, technicians like Prasad are repurposing broken and outdated laptops that many see as junk.

Many global manufacturers deliberately make repairs difficult by restricting access to spare parts, using proprietary screws, and implementing software locks that force customers to buy new devices instead of fixing old ones.</p><div><div><p><a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0.055555555555557,100,99.888888888889" data-pswp-height="1798" data-pswp-width="2697" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="Two boys transport discarded computer CPUs on a bicycle in Seelampur, one of India’s largest e-waste hubs, where informal recycling is a major source of livelihood." data-chromatic="ignore" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 700px" srcset="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=2400 2400w" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=2400"></a></p></div><p><figcaption><em>Two boys transport discarded computer CPUs on a bicycle in Seelampur, one of India’s largest e-waste hubs, where informal recycling is a major source of livelihood.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Satish Sinha, associate director at Toxics Link, a nonprofit working on waste management, believes repair technicians like Prasad and Singh are on the front lines of a larger battle.</p><p>“India has always had a repair culture, from fixing old radios to hand-me-down phones.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://yossarian.net/til/post/any-program-can-be-a-github-actions-shell/">https://yossarian.net/til/post/any-program-can-be-a-github-actions-shell/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43617493">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>In GitHub Actions, you can use the <code>shell</code> keyword to specify the shell
that runs a given <code>run:</code> block. This keyword is optional for workflows
but mandatory for action definitions.</p>
<p>The shell normally defaults to something sensible for your runner,
e.g. <code>bash</code> on Linux and macOS, and <code>pwsh</code> on Windows. But it can also be
specified, and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#defaultsrunshell">GitHub documents</a> that specifying it explicitly also
implies some flags of their choosing:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>#</span> setting bash explicitly implies bash --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail
</span><span>-</span> <span><span>shell</span></span><span>:</span> <span>bash</span>
  <span><span>run</span></span><span>:</span> <span>|</span>
<span>    echo "Hello, world!"
</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Based on that, you might think that there's a fixed number of valid
<code>shell</code> values<sup><a href="#fn-toolcache" id="fnref-toolcache" data-footnote-ref="">1</a></sup>, which GitHub tracks and adds their special flags to.
But you'd be wrong!</p>
<p>As it turns out, you can set <code>shell</code> to any executable on the <code>$PATH</code>,
and GitHub will happily use it to execute the <code>run</code> block. If the command
doesn't already take a single file as input, you need to pass it
the special <code>{0}</code> argument, which GitHub replaces with the temporary file
that it generates the template-expanded <code>run</code> block into.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, we can do all kinds of cursed things.</p>
<p>Using C as our step runner <a href="https://github.com/woodruffw-experiments/actions-experiments/pull/3">works fine</a>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>-</span> <span><span>run</span></span><span>:</span> <span>sudo apt install -y tcc</span>
<span>-</span> <span><span>shell</span></span><span>:</span> <span>tcc -run {0}</span>
  <span><span>run</span></span><span>:</span> <span>|</span>
<span>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    int main() {
      printf("Hello, world!\n");
      return 0;
    }
</span></span></code></pre>
<p>...and so does <a href="https://github.com/woodruffw-experiments/actions-experiments/pull/5">dynamically modifying</a> the <code>$PATH</code> via <code>$GITHUB_PATH</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>-</span> <span><span>run</span></span><span>:</span> <span>|</span>
<span>    touch ./bash
    chmod +x ./bash
    echo '#!/bin/sh' &gt; ./bash
    echo 'echo hello from fake bash' &gt;&gt; ./bash
    echo "${PWD}" &gt;&gt; "${GITHUB_PATH}"
</span><span>-</span> <span><span>run</span></span><span>:</span> <span>|</span>
<span>    echo "this doesn't do what you expect"
</span>  <span><span>shell</span></span><span>:</span> <span>bash</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Does this matter from a security perspective? It's hard to say — there
are plenty of other ways in which file writes imply execution in GitHub Actions,
including <code>GITHUB_ENV</code> itself.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it's surprising (IMO) that GitHub does <code>$PATH</code> lookups even
for their "well-known" shell values; I would expect those to be fixed to
specific values (e.g. <code>bash</code> to <code>/bin/bash</code>), especially since they inject
flags into the <code>run</code>'s command line based on those well-known values.</p>
<section data-footnotes="">
<ol>
<li id="fn-toolcache">
<p>Or, more generally, that GitHub will accept any pre-registered tool in its toolcache. That, for example, is how I thought <code>shell: python</code> worked, before I noticed this. <a href="#fnref-toolcache" data-footnote-backref="" data-footnote-backref-idx="1" aria-label="Back to reference 1">↩</a></p>

The U.S. Treasury, State Department, and FBI collectively estimate the IT workers scam has generated hundreds of millions each year since 2018.</p></li></ul><p>About 95% of the résumés Harrison Leggio gets in response to job postings for his crypto startup g8keep are from North Korean engineers pretending to be American, the founder estimates. He even once interviewed a job seeker who claimed to have worked at the same Manhattan-based cryptocurrency exchange as he did, during the time he worked there.</p><p>Turns out it was all a ruse: The programming languages the engineer said the company used were incorrect, and he claimed to have floated among teams rather than embedding in a single group, which “wasn’t a thing there,” said Leggio.</p><p>Nowadays, Leggio told <em>Fortune</em> he won’t even set up an interview with a candidate who seems promising on paper unless they agree to one final step.</p><p>“Say something negative about Kim Jong Un,” Leggio tells potential job candidates, referring to the third-generation authoritarian Supreme Leader of North Korea, officially the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Through research, Leggio learned insulting the DPRK’s Supreme Leader is forbidden, and North Korean citizens could face serious punishment for showing anything less than reverence.</p><p>“The first time I ever did it, the person started freaking out and cursing,” said Leggio.</p><p>The job seeker subsequently blocked Leggio across all social media platforms. Now Leggio makes the same request before every single interview. Other startups and founders he knows are asking the same thing of job seekers, he said.</p><h2>A yacht versus a missile</h2><p>The UN estimated the North Korean IT worker scam has generated <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/10/nashville-man-north-korean-remote-work-jobs-weapons-program-laptop-farm/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=advanced_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$250 million to $600 million;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">$250 million to $600 million</a>&nbsp;every year since 2018. As a result, cybersecurity experts of all stripes have banded together to <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/inside-the-scam-north-koreas-it-worker-threat" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:share information;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">share information</a> about the strategies, profiles, VPNs, and signs to watch for. But AI has emboldened the North Korean scheme, allowing the IT workers to develop scripts so they can hold down as many as six or seven jobs at a time, disguise their appearance, and even alter their voices so they don’t have an accent—or so they sound like a woman instead of a man. Experts <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/dprk-it-workers-expanding-scope-scale" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:predict;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">predict</a> the scope and scale will expand in 2025, moving across Europe and Asia with well-honed social engineering tactics paired with more aggressive job hunting at European defense and government companies.</p><p>Michael Barnhart, an intelligence leader at <a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Google;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Google</a> Cloud who has been <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tracking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">tracking</a> North Korean threats for years, explained the scheme this way: North Korean engineers, deployed to locations in China and Russia, use AI to create bios with eye-catching company experience highlighted. They work in teams to apply for jobs en masse, using stolen American identities, or with the help of <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-disrupts-north-korean-remote-it-worker-fraud-schemes-through-charges-and" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:facilitators;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">facilitators</a> in the U.S. or abroad. Some IT workers have even created <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/media/1320161/dl?inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:front companies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">front companies</a> to pose as legitimate recruiting firms or web-design agencies, for instance, that larger Fortune 500 companies then hire—not realizing it’s a North Korean front, said Barnhart.</p><p>“Right now, we have North Korean IT workers adapting so much that they’re not even doing IT work anymore,” he told <em>Fortune</em>.</p><div id="recirc-8d154401-37c0-38b5-b071-eb5cc8cc8ee4"><h2>More in World</h2></div><p>Among global companies, security teams have implemented different systems and strategies for rooting out North Korean IT workers seeking jobs as well as those already employed and working at companies, Barnhart said. And the stakes couldn’t be higher. The FBI <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250123" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">reported</a> the money funds nuclear weapons and operations, and the intelligence and data the IT workers illegally pilfer from companies is directed toward extortion, espionage, and data theft.</p><p>“There are criminals who steal your money to get yachts, but in this case, your money isn’t going to a Lamborghini—it’s going back to fund nuclear munitions,” said Barnhart. “A yacht versus a missile—attribution matters.”</p><h2>300-plus incidents in 2024</h2><p>Bojan Simic, CEO of identity-verification firm Hypr, built a product specifically for companies to verify people's identities because of the North Korean threat, he told <em>Fortune</em>. As a tech founder, he also deals with the issue within his own company. Simic accidentally hired an engineer who did a great job during the interview, but then the person who showed up to be onboarded on their first day wasn’t the person he hired. The engineer also failed a geolocation check, Simic said, and appeared to be in Spain when he claimed to live in Poland.</p><p>Emi Chiba, a senior principal analyst at <a href="https://fortune.com/company/gartner/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gartner;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Gartner</a> who has been researching the issue, told <em>Fortune</em> security experts should partner with internal human-resources teams to periodically re-verify the identities of employees and strengthen <a href="https://www.farnsworthintelligence.com/north-korean-it-farms-ioc-document-and-recommendations" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recruiting practices;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">recruiting practices</a>. The goal is to ensure job candidates aren’t hiding their locations overseas and pretending to be based in the U.S. Those practices range from camera-on video interviews to using identity verification tools with geolocation features to compare a government ID with a selfie, which would help match people to their identities and locations, she said.</p><p>“One of the biggest things you can do to combat this is training up HR staff,” added Barnhart.</p><p>Despite the efforts to disrupt it, cybersecurity company CrowdStrike <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/global-threat-report/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">reported</a> North Korean IT workers, a group it calls Famous Chollima, were behind 304 incidents in 2024, and its activities ramped up during the latter half of the year. In its latest assessment, CrowdStrike predicted Famous Chollima will continue its campaigns in 2025 given the financial success it’s seen and limited impact from federal prosecutions and government indictments last year.</p><p>Adam Meyers, senior vice president of CrowdStrike’s counter adversary team, told <em>Fortune </em>Famous Chollima has two main tentacles. One is a <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/12/14/north-korea-lazarus-crypto-hack-immunefi-2023-cybercrime/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:malware operation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">malware operation</a> that focuses on intelligence collection and <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/02/26/north-korea-hackers-crypto-heist-bybit-dubai-ether/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:crypto theft;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">crypto theft</a>, like the $1.5 billion cryptocurrency heist from a Dubai exchange. The other is the IT workers scam in which North Korean engineers get legitimate jobs and remit their salaries to North Korea to fund <a href="https://www.hrnk.org/documentations/slaves-bomb-role-north-koreas-nuclear-scientists/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nuclear weapons;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">nuclear weapons</a>, operations, and trade. The two prongs also work together to share intelligence.</p><p>In the IT worker scheme, once someone involved gets an interview, North Koreans use remote-desktop tools to help coach people through the Q&amp;A with a recruiter.</p><p>Aidan Raney, founder of Farnsworth Intelligence, posed as an American willing to help North Koreans to investigate the issue for a client who almost hired a fake engineer. During the course of two video calls with three or four people who all said their names were “Ben,” Raney learned the details. “The Bens” would handle all the upfront work for him—creating a fake <a href="https://fortune.com/company/linkedin/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:LinkedIn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">LinkedIn</a> profile to verify his new identity for U.S. recruiters, formulating a bio, and sending it out to dozens of job postings with a new Gmail address they set up.</p><p>The Bens even modified Raney’s headshot to a black-and-white photo so it wouldn’t resemble his usual picture, Raney told <em>Fortune</em>. If Raney got a job, he would show up for meetings, like a morning stand-up or scrum, and go about his day while a North Korean engineer handled the workload. Raney would be allowed to keep 30% of the salary but had to transfer 70% to the Bens using crypto, Paypal, or Payoneer.</p><p>“What they were trying to do was use my identity to bypass background checks, and so they wanted this fake persona they created to be extremely close to the real-life version,” said Raney.</p><p>The Bens got Raney an interview, and while it was ongoing, they used a remote-desktop application to set up a notepad on Raney’s screen so they could write out responses to the questions from the interviewer, Raney explained. And it worked: Raney got a verbal offer for a job with a private government contractor that paid $80,000 a year.</p><p>He then had to immediately turn around and tell the company he couldn’t accept the offer and apologize for claiming their time.</p><p>“Now that they’re using real Americans who have verified identities and documents and they’re using their real faces—everything looks real,” said Raney. “There would be nothing stopping them from being hired.”</p><p>In the past two years, the Department of Justice has <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1380081/dl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:indicted;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">indicted</a> dozens of North Korean citizens and unnamed coconspirators in the scheme, charging them for stealing American identities, conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions, wire fraud, and money laundering.

      <section>
        <p>"It's impossible to kill a media brand," Jim Spanfeller told me on my first day working for him, as we sat in his corner office. He had just bought the business news organization, <a href="https://qz.com/?ref=zachseward.com">Quartz</a>, that I had <a href="https://www.zachseward.com/thank-you-quartz/" rel="noreferrer">spent the past decade</a> building and, most recently, trying desperately to save from oblivion. So I was inclined to believe him.</p><p>But I knew it wasn't true. Jim and his <a href="https://www.greathillpartners.com/?ref=zachseward.com">private-equity-backed</a> digital-media conglomerate <a href="https://g-omedia.com/?ref=zachseward.com">G/O Media</a> had already destroyed several of their properties, some all at once (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/01/775548069/after-days-of-resignations-the-last-of-the-deadspin-staff-have-quit?ref=zachseward.com">Deadspin</a>), most of the others by sapping resources, antagonizing their staff, and undermining the editorial visions that once made them great (<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/jezebel-editor-in-chief-laura-bassett-quits/?ref=zachseward.com">Jezebel</a>, <a href="https://www.gawkerarchives.com/media/what-happened-at-the-root?ref=zachseward.com">The Root</a>). It would take him three years to do the same to Quartz.</p><p>The end came on Friday, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gmgunion.bsky.social/post/3llz7s5jeok2c?ref=zachseward.com">when G/O fired</a> the few remaining writers at Quartz and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/redbrick-acquires-quartz-g-o-192800730.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJr-lIw5hUIOZAtf2jxkJ_405wdnXtaEEzpxsQIiysw-ByR1A3LFzdYqEXcChDmP4ShKL3W7xbAUQsj7Ko1U7-jt1WLcsWNoJYB2BpmEWRbSZcuCuh-4XgOWLjIu55vdotvmgkqFXP71_YyHV9LIgjgtDBEA9rExP-CQ8x-XdLar&amp;ref=zachseward.com">sold the carcass</a> to a Canadian firm that appears mostly interested in the email list. I thought back to Jim's comment. His cynical view of digital media was good neither for journalism nor business, but maybe Jim was right about that one thing. What is Quartz now if not a "media brand" that refuses to die?</p>

<p>We <a href="https://qz.com/6014/hello-world-a-welcome-letter-from-our-editor-in-chief?ref=zachseward.com" rel="noreferrer">launched Quartz</a> in 2012 with <a href="https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/the-atlantic-names-gideon-lichfield-global-news-editor-of-quartz/?ref=zachseward.com">prestigious editorial hires</a>, a <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2012/09/quartz-the-new-biz-news-site-is-a-technological-and-structural-innovator-with-only-a-few-hiccups/?ref=zachseward.com">slick new website</a>, <a href="https://allthingsd.com/20120924/quartz-shoots-for-tablet-and-mobile-readers-but-doesnt-arm-itself-with-an-app/?ref=zachseward.com">bold pronouncements</a> about the future of media, and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/business/media/with-digital-only-quartz-atlantic-to-cover-business-world.html?unlocked_article_code=1.9U4.DvAc.tBenqzXRhaA0&amp;smid=url-share&amp;ref=zachseward.com">splashy profile</a> in The New York Times in which we likened ourselves to a "pirate ship attacking the Royal Navy." It sure felt that way. From a <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2015/05/quartz-is-an-api-the-path-ahead-for-the-business-site-thats-reshaping-digital-news/?ref=zachseward.com#:~:text=That%20image%20reminds%20me%20of%20another%20one%2C%20a%20photograph%20that%20Kevin%20%5BDelaney%2C%20Quartz%20editor%2Din%2Dchief%20and%20president%5D%20took%20of%20the%20first%20Quartz%20office%20in%20SoHo%20about%20three%20years%20ago.%20Look%20at%20all%20that%20room!">spare SoHo loft</a>, and then increasingly <a href="https://www.officelovin.com/2017/10/tour-quartzs-sleek-new-nyc-office/?ref=zachseward.com">fancier offices</a>, we set out to be compelling, entertaining, serious, and excellent all at the same time. Everything was up for reinvention, from the <a href="https://martinbelam.com/2013/smartden-kevin-delaney/?ref=zachseward.com">structure of our stories</a> to the <a href="https://digiday.com/media/quartz-guide-making-ads-dont-suck/?ref=zachseward.com">design of our ads</a> to the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3054334/traditional-homepages-are-obsolete-says-quartz-heres-what-they-built-instead?ref=zachseward.com">need for a traditional homepage</a>. We believed that a news organization should stand for something, which in our case was <a href="https://qz.com/832998/the-case-for-free-trade-open-borders-and-the-new-global-economy?ref=zachseward.com" rel="noreferrer">globalism</a>. Most of all, we put a strong <a href="https://awards.journalists.org/entries/qz-com/?ref=zachseward.com">emphasis on quality</a> at a time when online journalism was still considered inferior to print publications that happened to have websites.</p><p>I think, in all those respects, we succeeded. Nothing about what ultimately transpired makes me regret the choices we made or the fun that we had. Quartz produced a lot of <a href="https://blog.qz.com/quartz-awards-2019-edition-ab067db5b1a9?ref=zachseward.com">great journalism</a>, served <a href="https://www.zachseward.com/presumed-audiences-in-digital-media/">our readers</a> well, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/business/media/quartz-delaney-out.html?ref=zachseward.com#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20really%20proud%20of%20how%20Quartz%20has%20helped%20to%20fundamentally%20redefine%20the%20media%20industry%E2%80%99s%20approach%20to%20journalism%2C%20product%2C%20and%20advertising%20%E2%80%94%20and%20connected%20with%20tens%20of%20millions%20of%20readers%20around%20the%20world%20along%20the%20way%2C%E2%80%9D%20Mr.%20Delaney%20said%20in%20a%20statement.">widely influenced</a> the rest of our industry. If that's all Quartz was in the end, I'll take it.</p><p>Still, we also hoped to endure on the scale of centuries, just like rival news organizations — in particular, The Financial Times, The Economist, and The Wall Street Journal — that we viewed as our Goliaths. For a stretch in the middle there, it <a href="https://mashable.com/archive/quarts-tops-economist-traffic?ref=zachseward.com">even seemed possible</a>. But Quartz never made money. We grew, between 2012 and 2018, to nearly 250 employees and $35 million in annual revenue. The dismal economics of digital media meant losing more than $40 million over that stretch just to grow unsustainably large. A trade publication, which <a href="https://digiday.com/media/is-quartz-the-very-model-of-a-modern-publisher/?ref=zachseward.com">once called</a> Quartz "the very model a modern publisher," started <a href="https://digiday.com/future-of-tv/quartz-sees-video-subscriptions-driver/?ref=zachseward.com">literally portraying us</a> as pushing a boulder up a hill. Someone on our staff printed out the illustration and stuck it to a wall in our office, where it remained until the end.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>§</p>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Twenty-eighteen would prove to be the peak of the endeavor and, not incidentally, the year our original owner, David Bradley, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/02/business/dealbook/quartz-atlantic-media-uzabase.html?ref=zachseward.com">decided to sell</a>. Quartz had <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3260d3a0-9f86-11e5-beba-5e33e2b79e46?ref=zachseward.com">attracted takeover interest</a> over the years from major media companies like <a href="https://www.iac.com/?ref=zachseward.com">IAC</a> and <a href="https://www.nytco.com/?ref=zachseward.com">The New York Times</a> and even, to our astonishment, the luxury fashion house <a href="https://www.lvmh.com/en?ref=zachseward.com">LVMH</a>. Their interest ultimately fizzled. It was a small Japanese financial data firm, <a href="https://www.uzabase.com/en/?ref=zachseward.com">Uzabase</a>, that made the highest and final bid, at $86 million.</p><p>As business journalists, we of course recognized that Quartz was fundamentally a financial asset subject to the whims of market forces beyond our control. I may have known it intellectually, but still viewed Quartz <a href="https://qz.com/1930012/join-our-mission-to-make-business-better-as-quartz-becomes-an-independent-media-company?ref=zachseward.com">as a movement</a> out to prove something more noble. So when Uzabase <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/quartz-is-put-on-the-block-just-two-years-after-sale-11602034051?ref=zachseward.com">gave up on us</a> two years later, at the height of the pandemic, I quixotically decided to <a href="https://blog.qz.com/quartz-acquired-by-co-founder-and-ceo-zach-seward-in-management-buyout-1cd3eda1fd81?ref=zachseward.com">buy the company</a> myself. The price tag was <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/11/10/financial-website-quartz-may-have-been-sold-for-1-sources-say/?ref=zachseward.com">next-to-nothing</a> but also required financing the buyout and taking on the risk of surviving, for the first time, as an independent company.</p><p>The two years we spent on our own was the most challenging stretch of my tenure at Quartz. I started having panic attacks. One morning shortly after the buyout, I fainted and fell limp to the floor of my bedroom. But it was also a freeing time. A <a href="https://blog.qz.com/quartz-welcomes-new-reporters-based-in-taipei-nairobi-new-york-and-san-francisco-301a89ec7fd0?ref=zachseward.com">new generation</a> of employees breathed life into our journalism and <a href="https://qz.com/1999070/quartz-essentials-our-way-of-extracting-knowledge-from-the-news?ref=zachseward.com">products</a>, while financial independence gave the company, which I incorporated as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation?ref=zachseward.com">public benefit</a> corporation, <a href="https://qz.com/1878256/what-is-the-purpose-of-business-journalism?ref=zachseward.com">new purpose</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paycheck_Protection_Program?ref=zachseward.com">Paycheck Protection Program</a>, for small businesses affected by the pandemic, helped keep us afloat.</p><p>Investors who specialized in "distressed assets" would call from time-to-time. They all had the same idea: Fire most of the staff and reboot Quartz as an email-only publication focused on aggregation of business news. As a business model, it might have made sense, but it wasn't appealing. Muddling along with few or no journalists would be a worse outcome, I felt, than just shutting the place down.</p><p>That is how I came to realize Quartz was, and always had been, <a href="https://qzlife.tumblr.com/?ref=zachseward.com">its people</a>. The hundreds of people who built and constantly rebuilt Quartz, who did the work, who supported each other through all the changes, who gave the place <a href="https://blog.qz.com/quartz-life-end-of-the-year-awards-bd8695496fe9?ref=zachseward.com#:~:text=In%20celebration%20and%20recognition%20of%20this%20work%2C,Force%20of%20Ideas%2C%20and%20Spirit%20of%20Generosity.">its values</a>, and who brought those values to other companies when they moved on. (Quartz alumni are all over today's great media companies, 22 of us at The Times alone.) We really did believe in what we were doing.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>So how did such an earnest enterprise end up in the maws of private equity? By 2022, we were running short of cash and didn't have anyone willing to put up more money, especially as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/business/media/buzzfeed-digital-media-wrong.html?ref=zachseward.com">enthusiasm waned</a> for the entire digital-media sector. We put together a quick M&amp;A process and made clear that preference would go to anyone willing to take on all of the roughly 80 people still working at Quartz.</p><p>G/O was the only suitor willing to make that commitment, and still bid three times more than the next-highest offer. That meant there was enough cash in the deal to share <a href="https://talkingbiznews.com/media-news/quartz-ceo-seward-to-staff-youll-get-a-cut-of-the-sale/?ref=zachseward.com">more than $1 million</a> of the proceeds with employees, who each got a stake in Quartz when we went independent. It was a far better outcome than I thought possible when we started the process, just desperate to survive.</p><p>My own investment would also turn out well, thanks to G/O's stubborn insistence that it only wanted Quartz's assets and not the corporate entity, which for complicated accounting reasons was still pretty valuable. I mention all these details, I must admit, out of spite. Jim would often talk about his feeling that journalists were bad businesspeople and taunt us about past decisions by asking, "How'd that work out for you?" Now G/O is in retreat, and today's strongest for-profit media companies are <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/?ref=zachseward.com">run</a> <a href="https://www.dowjones.com/?ref=zachseward.com">by</a> <a href="https://www.axios.com/?ref=zachseward.com">former</a> <a href="https://www.nytco.com/?ref=zachseward.com">reporters</a>.</p><p>At one point late in the sale process, Jim acted like he was no longer interested, and stopped returning my calls. That forced us to stare down the prospect of running completely out of cash and collapsing, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/31/the-messenger-news-startup-shutters?ref=zachseward.com">Messenger-style</a>, as Jim well knew. We had no choice but to call his bluff. He went ahead with the purchase.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>§</p>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>I put on a <a href="https://medium.com/@quartz/quartz-acquired-by-g-o-media-f22e0da98010?ref=zachseward.com">brave face</a>, but we were under no illusions about the likely fate of Quartz under G/O's ownership. The sale immediately prompted obituaries; New York magazine <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/04/quartz-media-history.html?ref=zachseward.com">deemed us</a> "the history of internet media in just 10 years," which I still take as a compliment, even though we wanted 100 years.</p><p>It's still not quite clear to me what Jim thought he was buying or why he was so desperate to have it. In the subject line of his email announcing the deal, he spelled our name "<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jim-spanfeller-proudly-announces-purchase-of-quarts-its-quartz/?ref=zachseward.com">Quarts</a>," and that set the tone for the level of care in what he had bought. But borrowing money was still incredibly cheap at that time (interest rates were <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/fed/fed-rate-hikes-2022-2023-timeline-discussion?ref=zachseward.com">about to surge</a>, another case of good timing), and I guess the allure of an existing media brand was too hard to resist. In retrospect, "it's impossible to kill" sounds to me less like an adage and more like a challenge.</p><p>Everyone who could quit did so as soon as they could. A few diehards held on longer, and were tortured or fired, or both, for their sacrifice. I left on the day my contract allowed it, exactly a year after the sale. G/O ultimately filled up the site with <a href="https://qz.com/7-weird-tourist-attractions-u-s-mexico-thailand-1851772879?ref=zachseward.com">2000s-era slideshows</a> and <a href="https://futurism.com/quartz-ai-generated-articles-slop-errors?ref=zachseward.com">AI-generated earnings stories</a>. It took another two years for me to process the loss and for G/O to complete its demolition.</p><p>The media business often feels like a battle between idealists and cynics. Most of my <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/?ref=zachseward.com">favorite</a> <a href="https://documentedny.com/?ref=zachseward.com">news</a> <a href="https://outliermedia.org/?ref=zachseward.com">startups</a> of the current era have chosen the non-profit path, which has its own major challenges, but at least cynicism is not one of them. Quartz is now a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Notable-zombie-brands?ref=zachseward.com">zombie brand</a>, which is the most cynical move in media.</p><p>I never wanted to write this piece while good people were still working at Quartz. Now it can be laid to rest.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Knowledge-intensive analytical applications retrieve context from both structured tabular data and unstructured, text-free documents for effective decision-making. Large language models (LLMs) have made it significantly easier to prototype such retrieval and reasoning data pipelines. However, implementing these pipelines efficiently still demands significant effort and has several challenges. This often involves orchestrating heterogeneous data systems, managing data movement, and handling low-level implementation details, e.g., LLM context management.
<br>To address these challenges, we introduce FlockMTL: an extension for DBMSs that deeply integrates LLM capabilities and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FlockMTL includes model-driven scalar and aggregate functions, enabling chained predictions through tuple-level mappings and reductions. Drawing inspiration from the relational model, FlockMTL incorporates: (i) cost-based optimizations, which seamlessly apply techniques such as batching and caching; and (ii) resource independence, enabled through novel SQL DDL abstractions: PROMPT and MODEL, introduced as first-class schema objects alongside TABLE. FlockMTL streamlines the development of knowledge-intensive analytical applications, and its optimizations ease the implementation burden.

    <p>The day was nearing to a close. The sun has already set, but that Friday evening in Amsterdam was still warm. Unusually warm, in fact, for those late days in March – as if spring decided to bless my piligrimage, for that piligrimage was not jovial.</p>

<p>I was sitting at a ramen joint, sipping on the broth. To my left, a blue, crinkled supermarket shopping bag was sitting solemnly, inconspicuously.</p>

<p>Inside that bag sat a slightly used Mac Studio, which I have just purchased to be able to edit CSS of my own application.</p>

<p>By the time that evening descended upon the south of Amsterdam, I have lost 3 days of my life trying to figure out why I was unable to edit CSS.</p>

<p>But let me rewind a bit.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="act-1-it-starts-with-an-app">Act 1: It starts with an app</h2>

<p>I tend to listen to people. So when the time came to start a new app - which I haven’t done in quite some time - I knew that I would like it to be modern enough. Modern enough, even, for me to be able to delegate some work on it to others once the time comes.</p>

<p>So, while traveling, I started coding on that app - on the MacBook I carry with me normally. And one of the technologies I figured I should use - because all the cool kids do it, right? - was <a href="http://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind.</a> At <a href="https://cheddar.me/">work</a> most of our setup is already on Tailwind, with some bits and bobs still not ported - but every time I needed to edit something in the specifically CSS-heavy parts of our UI, it was a bit of a struggle. I do understand the value proposition of the library, but I have it rough with learning modern CSS “two ways” - once for what Tailwind uses for dialect, and once for what it actually does.</p>

<p>To add insult to injury, one of my respected colleagues finally got enough of my lamentations (“why does it have to be so hard”) and – rightfully – told me, that if we are all working on a system which uses a certain piece of technology – I better get in line and learn it properly.</p>

<p>Since Tailwind 4 recently came out, and we would be upgrading our work app to that, I figured I could grab it to try and muster some layout in the new side project that was starting.</p>

<p>So far - so good. I found that there was a gem for Tailwind for Rails (perplexing, though, that a Rails app using Tailwind does <em>not</em> use that gem but instead uses https://github.com/rails/cssbundling-rails), so I went with that. And… it sorta worked. I liked that Tailwind 4 does not need all this baroque config setup, I liked not having to deal with Node, and I started slowly getting to grips with this <a href="https://youtu.be/QWWPk9jrvqk?t=173">RAF banter CSS:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Min-em-4! Wee-full! Fit-contain hover beegee-teal-100!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was honestly OK (except that I had to keep about a dozen tabs of Tailwind docs open to do even a very basic layout). A couple of days were spent working, but I wanted to continue on my home setup - where I would have the luxury of a decent desk, 2 displays and some silence. The app needed to be ready in a few days for a customer tryout.</p>

<p>And that’s where things went south.</p>

<h2 id="act-2-sigill">Act 2: SIGILL</h2>

<p>Upon returning to Rotterdam, I checked out the code of the app onto my Trashcan Mac Pro - which is, by all accounts, one of the best Apple machines I have owned and used. After a GPU replacement it has been working super-reliably, day in, day out. It has 128GB of memory (how much is that in today’s M4 Ultra prices again?). It has more than enough cores to run things in parallel. It hosts Thunderbolt devices that I need and use without me having to replace them. It can also be disassembled without ripping adhesives, cleaned - and has helped me along through a multitude of projects and challenges.</p>

<p>The ease of doing <code>SQLite3::Database.new(":memory:")</code> would hardly be permissible without those 128 gigabytes, by the way.</p>

<p>And so I check out the app, and boot <code>bin/dev</code>. Upon which I see a curious bit of output in my terminal:</p>



<p>Now, everything works fine on this app otherwise. <code>convert</code> works great. New ImageMagick did install (after recompliling half of Homebrew, but it did install fine). Rails boots. Node nodes. Databases database. Compilers compile. Why is it that Tailwind, which is a CSS preprocessor - like, for reals, this thing <em>tokenizes text</em> - would not run?</p>

<p>I start investigating, and before long I arrive at an interesting discovery. Tailwind did change majorly between 3 and 4, and not only in the way of syntax. See, it used to be a set of Node modules that you install - and a set of configs that you had to write. Tailwind 4, though, is no longer a Node module… or - rather - it still <em>is</em> a Node module, if you want it that way. But it is actually a binary! A 100MB binary (for parsing HTML and extracting class names from it).</p>

<p>And that binary has to come from some place. Upon some investigation - it turns out that the binary is, actually, a build of <a href="https://bun.sh/">bun</a> and an amalgamation of all the bits and bobs that comprise Tailwind. It also turns out that Bun is very…. modern. So modern, in fact, that it requires support for <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255665503?sortBy=rank">AVX2</a> instructions if you dare to run it on an Intel CPU. Which - of course - my MacPro does not support.</p>

<p>It also turned out that Linux users did get into <a href="https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/15181">exactly the same quagmire</a> as I did. It turns out that nobody guarantees you that your build step will run on a box which has these instructions. And Docker or not, if your processor can’t do a <code>%vpand</code> - the thing will crash. The signal I saw - “illegal instruction”, or <code>SIGILL</code> - is a sign of this happening.</p>

<p>And - it turns ourt - Tailwind already uses bun-baseline on Linux because a lot of people complained that they are unable to run their builds on their CI systems, on their servers - but also: on some Linux machines people own. There is little reason a 10 year old CPU should not be capable of tokenizing HTML. As a matter of fact - it does so just fine, with pretty much anything libxml-based, as it does with Nokogiri in Rails - and a plethora of other applications.</p>

<p>I then assume that just creating an build with <code>bun-baseline</code> should fix it, and I open an issue. I also wanted to try building the binary myself, upon which I discovered that, to build a module that tokenizes CSS classes, I need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A recent Node</li>
  <li>pnpm</li>
  <li>Rust</li>
  <li>Bun build environment</li>
</ul>

<p>…and upon installing all of the above - I found that the thing just would not run, because… it could not load one of the bun-related NPM modules.</p>

<p>I assumed that this issue was a skill issue on my part, and so I decided to wait for the maintainers to release a new version just putting the flag on. At this point, I already lost 1 day to debugging this.</p>

<p>Yes, exactly when I needed to do the actual app, I was already 1 day into the yak shave of figuring out why my CSS processing system crashes with a SIGILL. Mind you: not a plugin which does some fancy video decoding. Not a particle generator. A piece of code that chews text files and parses CSS classes used in those text files.</p>

<h2 id="act-3-cdn">Act 3: CDN</h2>

<p>To be able to proceed I had to divert for an interim solution. I was already committed to Tailwind on that app, and I had some styles defined. Now, even though I do have a bachelor’s in design, doing web layout for me is still <em>hard.</em> Very hard, in fact. The number of decisions you need to make, and the number of edge cases you must be considering - like, “design engineering” is a legitimate discipline.</p>

<p>So, I figured - Tailwind generates CSS classes. Yes, for doing its thing it scans your HTML and parses out the classes, and then copies them into the CSS output. But there surely, certainly, totally should be a static CSS file that I can <em>damn link</em> into my HTML to just have the same? During development I don’t really care it will be some MBs in size, as long as it has all the classes predefined. I don’t use <code>@apply</code> as I first wanted to test the waters just using Tailwind “as is”.</p>

<p>And it turns out Tailwind has such a file available - which is called <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn">PlayCDN</a>. Supposedly, you link it into your HTML file and it “just works”.</p>

<p>Sort of. Because - as it turns out - Tailwind 4, while still being “zeroconfig” - which I wholly support (frontend tools have been absolutely egregious and inconsiderate with introducing configurations left, right and center) - is not so when you want to use an amalgamated version of it.</p>

<p>See, my layout has lost borders. All borders. All of them. No amount of twiddling could give them back short of forcing an inline <code>style</code> declaration - or setting my own CSS classes on the elements. As it turns out - there is such a thing as “preflight”, which is a sophisticated form of CSS reset. For some reason that I could not quite figure out, this “preflight” is <a href="https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/15967">permanently enabled in the CDN variant of Tailwind</a> - and, moreover, it overrides the standard Tailwind classes.</p>

<p>Under normal use, Tailwind classes are supposed to override the preflight. That’s how CSS works. That’s how selector specificity works. Except here.</p>

<p>So - I stubbornly continued to fight the layouts, just keeping in the back of my head that “these borders will come back once this bun issue is sorted”</p>

<h2 id="act-4-all-hope-is-lost">Act 4: All hope is lost.</h2>

<p>A new release of Tailwind 4 comes out, which uses the <code>bun-baseline</code> build declaration. I immediately download it, set the path for the <code>tailwindcss-rails</code> gem, and prepare to revel in my reacquired ability of specifying CSS borders - which, for reasons of Amazing Design Technological Advancement, somehow had to be taken away by progress.</p>

<p>And what do I see in the terminal?</p>

<p>A <code>SIGILL</code> stubbornly stares at me. Using baseline <code>bun</code> did jack shit. Parsing my HTML still tries to use CPU instructions which I do not have available.</p>

<p>How could that be? Very simply, as it turns out. Bun just <em>disabled</em> compatibility with the last version of macOS that runs on my machine. Just like that. As this was done, the next logical consideration was as follows: since there are no machines without the AVX2 instruction set on the CPU that are supported by the <em>next</em> major macOS version, it is no use to have a build without those instructions!</p>

<p>But “to not break builds” the <code>baseline</code> declaration was kept in place. As an alias.</p>

<p>My computer with 128GB of RAM and 6 CPU cores was, as of summer 2024, officially not good enough to process CSS selectors.</p>

<p>At this stage I just wanted to proceed with the app, and I was sick to my stomach of having spent so much time on this issue. It did not bring me joy. It did not bring me convenience. And it did not advance my app one inch - all it gave me was a rabbit hole to dive into, head first, and a cup of frustration to drink to the very bottom.</p>

<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue.</h2>

<p>And this is what brings me to that faithful day. I was contemplating a new computer for a while, and was even eyeing an M3 Ultra MacStudio. Only it is so that the beast is on backorder here. On a 3 week backorder, in fact - as if you are buying an nVidia 5090 on its release date. So after a quick trip to Marktplaats I decided to settle this and found a barely-used M2 machine I could purchase. Today.</p>

<p>I brought it home, installed everything, figured out everything that was utterly borked on macOS Sequoia versus Monterey I used to run, and ran my app. The borders I have coded in Tailwind looked amazing. By this time, another day was spent on setting up this new machine. Another day, thus, which was not spent on moving the app forward.</p>

<p>The borders were amazing, but I did the only thing that - at this time - was sane. And which was, in fact, suggested by a couple of folks I deeply respect.</p>

<p>With some help of a friend I ripped Tailwind out of that app for good, and I promise - unless it flies high and warrants a team working on it, it is not going to be making a comeback.</p>

<h2 id="what-it-is-actually-about">What it is actually about</h2>

<p>You may well think that I am “another grumpy Rails developer who hates modern frontend”. Or - that I am another “ageing Mac user who doesn’t want to move on with the times”. Or - “I know this guy, he never makes anything of value and just likes being angry and frustrated”. Or - <a href="https://live.julik.nl/2013/05/javascript-is-shit">he just hates JavaScript and frontend… </a> <a href="https://blog.julik.nl/2024/02/change-my-mind">Changing your mind is not my job</a> You are very welcome, nobody is forcing you to read this article - and it was a pleasure to have you visit.</p>

<p>But there is a more important angle here that I want to share, as it matters. I don’t like swearing, but I will this time around - <strong>it fucking matters.</strong></p>

<p>And it is this. We sometimes jump on using tech not because we <em>need it.</em> Not because we <em>want to.</em> But because we have FOMO. Either - we fear not being “current” and becoming “unhireable”, or - we fear not being “smart enough” in today’s market. One of the parts of being a good software maker is being “up on the latest” - you don’t have to use all of it, but - in the web world for sure - you need to have at least some basic understanding of how things work.</p>

<p>And sometimes, we even have colleagues who - for they don’t know better - start gently nudging us to explore if we don’t know. That nudging may, actually, turn into prodding - and then to mobbing - if you see that there is a technology choice that is not efficient, not great, and that is not a good fit - yet you have to use it anyway. <strong>Using and not loving</strong> is not considered enough.</p>

<h2 id="why-techfluencing-can-be-harmful">Why techfluencing can be harmful</h2>

<p>And then there are influencers. “If you are not using <code>$tech</code> 0 you are missing out.” “<code>$tech</code> is a game-changer - you can try to spend 10 years building half of it, badly, and won’t get nearly as good”.</p>

<p>I won’t be pointing fingers, but there is a cohort of “frontend-adjacent” influencers (at least 4) - who do this all the time.</p>

<p>And while they do get their exposure, their likes and subs and their premium followers - they either do not understand, how harmful their approach is - or they engage in it knowingly.</p>

<p>Because the biggest fear of may software folks is <em>becoming irrelevant.</em> And good software folks - ones on top of their game, whip-smart, kind, caring folks - do know that their own assessment of their relevance is likely <em>not</em> accurate. And they try to get it externally, “probe” the environment to know what’s about.</p>

<p>Who do they turn to? Their tech lead they no longer have? Their engineering manager who is waving JIRA tickets and asking questions about “5 years”? A community enthusiast who has just finished migrating his pet project from Elm to Rescript?</p>

<p>Likely not. But content from influencers is easily accessible and easily consumable. Moreover - it gets cooked in such a way as to be catchy, captivating and to sound authoritative. You don’t have to be an overt jerk to be dismissive and authoritative - the soft-spoken, passive-agressive tone, combined with a perfect haircut and great lighting, will also do the job. So will stealing other people’s ideas and capturing a community.</p>

<p>And if you consume it <em>just enough</em> you will start to second guess yourself. “Am I actually going in the right direction?” “Did I pick the right tool?” “Should I give this new fancy thing a whirl?”</p>

<p>And every junction - every decision - every infinitesimal choice you need to make when building your app - will be this second-guessing game.</p>

<p>And there is another reason for this second-guessing and for why those choices are difficult. If you have been at this game for long enough - you know that the <strong>hardest</strong> migrations and upgrades on your app are going to be the frontend upgrades. Node version changes, bundler version changes, syntax changes, changes of defaults. React router upgrades, create-react-app sunsetting, arrival-then-departure of SASS, then libsass, then Blueprint… A choice made badly is going to have consequences.</p>

<p>And the consequences can be quite sad, because these “fad of the day” frontend tools are great when you are making apps for clients - and then throw them over the fence and forget about. It is not going to be your problem when CSS suddenly stops working, or the React team deprecates an essential feature - it is going to be the problem of that poor sod who will be tasked with “figuring out how we fix this vulnerability”. By the time he gets started on it, you will be long gone - upgrading your current project from Elm to Rescript.</p>

<p>But if we are following the other direction that is, apparently, the right way to go (for many reasons) - and we build something for ourselves - we look into the future - and we see that there won’t be “that poor sod” dealing with this Byzantine pyramid of dependencies. It is going to be us. Pick wisely.</p>

<p>And the right way to pick, on your own project, is this - and I have learned it well, this time around:</p>

<p><strong>Use what you already know know well.</strong> Think about your end goal. Is it to learn <code>$tech</code>? Or is it to build an app and get actual users? Do not blend the two. Use something that’s already melted into your fingers, unless you have space for going on adventures.</p>

<p>My biggest mistake was not “not learning Tailwind before”. It was not “not using Next.js”. Tailwind would have crashed just the same under turbopack as it did for me under Rails.</p>

<p>My biggest mistake was trying to combine “learning a new technology” with “delivering an app quickly”. Layout is hard already. Design is hard already. UX is hard already. Hard enough without all of these extra things on top.</p>

<h2 id="but-what-about-tailwind-actually">But what about Tailwind, actually?</h2>

<p>Tailwind is nice, and yet very painful at the same time. The things I really liked:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It offers colocation of HTML and CSS. This is, if anything, its best property.</li>
  <li>It scopes your styles from the get go (and kills enough inheritance for you to mostly ignore inheritance)</li>
  <li>It removes the struggle of “should I use BEM or Emmet or whatever” for naming your CSS classes</li>
  <li>It adds a reasonable set of variables for text sizing and layout spacings</li>
  <li>It gives you some reasonable color tints that have names and are easy to memorize</li>
</ul>

<p>Things I found very painful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You have to learn another CSS syntax. “Just” CSS is not enough even though modern CSS is already vast. Knowing Tailwind does not free you from having to know standard CSS just as knowing Clojure requires you to know bare Java - and know it well, just as knowing CoffeeScript back in the day required you to know vanilla JS.</li>
  <li>CSS is rife with context - modifiers, <code>:active</code>, <code>:first-child</code>, <code>:not</code> etc. Slapping classes on a particular element sometimes works in this paradigm, and sometimes it does not. Or – does not work that well.</li>
  <li>When you are doing layout - which is hard enough already - you often need to adjust many elements to the same styling, at the same time. Having to do multiedits directly depends on the capabilities of your editor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Honestly, the two latter ones I could live with - and, after all, I could revert to <code>@apply</code> - which would drag me back to standard-CSS-but-having-to-express-it-in-Tailwind-for-some-reason. The first one - a dealbreaker.</p>

<p>Why? Well, because doing layout is hard already. I need to do a lot of energy to imagine how my app needs to look, how it should behave. That is already hard enough.</p>

<p>Doing the mental translation from that into CSS, and <em>then</em> another mental translation into Tailwind - is just too much, for little benefit.</p>

<p>What I did find from the Tailwind experience is that I absolutely <em>do</em> want 2 things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A better CSS reset (primarily - to nullify inheritance)</li>
  <li>A good way to specify localised CSS that does not affect layouts except for the one it is used in</li>
</ul>

<p>For the former I will likely look for a good reset. For the latter - I already found a solution that works beautifully in Rails, does not require any preprocessors or Node modules whatsoever, and completely covers this use case (and more).</p>

<h2 id="thinking-like-a-maintainer">Thinking like a maintainer</h2>

<p>And then there is one more thing. See, I <em>know</em> that shipping end-user software - like the Tailwind compiler - if that software is written in an interpreted language - is fucking hard. I <em>know</em> that getting binaries built for older versions of macOS <a href="https://blog.julik.nl/2014/12/the-hell-of-building-nuke-dylibs">is an absolute abomination.</a> - seriously, just read that article if you don’t believe me. And I absolutely admire Brad, for example, who stubbornly went and <a href="https://terminalwire.com/articles/tebako">built the Terminalwire binaries using tebako.</a></p>

<p>When I worked on <a href="https://github.com/guerilla-di/tracksperanto">Tracksperanto,</a> one of the most popular questions I got from studios was how to install it without having to install Ruby and Rubygems. Like.. shipping scripted products is hard!</p>

<p>But here is the rub: if you play that game, you have to play it well. It is not for nothing the TypeScript compiler is getting moved to Go. It is not for nothing that esbuild, which I consider to be <em>the only</em> web bundler product that was done right, from the start - is written in Go. You can dislike Rob Pike’s attitudes all you want - and I do - but one thing is undeniable: Go is absolutely stellar at the monobinary-for-every-imaginable-platform.</p>

<p>And if you play that game, having both instruction set compatibility and ABI compatibility with the target platforms does, sorta-kinda, become <em>your</em> problem. So, exactly because I do know what I am talking about, if I were in this situation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I would never pick an experimental runtime for a product I want to be popular</li>
  <li>I would really consider whether parsing attributes in HTML warrants bringing along such a large toolchain (Rust? pnmp? bun? bun-standalone?)</li>
  <li>…and with all those considerations: I would either rewrite Tailwind in Go or leave it be a Node module. Node does work everywhere. Bun does not. Node does have governance which would not allow it to turn into a lemon on a sizeable number of machines, but Bun does not - Bun’s governance is Jared.</li>
</ul>

<p>And yes, I know it is incredibly tempting to just keep developing your software in “that language you know and everybody else in my ecosystem knows”. It can also become a bad bet exactly when you see that this approach has downsides. And yes, it is now your problem too - to be aware of those downsides, and pick the users’ convenience over <em>your</em> comfort as developer.</p>

<p>And it’s not like there never was a precedent before, in an completely adjacent field too: remember <a href="https://github.com/sass/libsass">libsass?</a> While it did not pursue a monobinary approach - but needed to speed up builds with <em>A Gawddam’ Shitton Of SCSS</em> - and it was C++.</p>

<p>So: yes, I do not find the Tailwind team made the right tradeoffs in picking a platform for Tailwind 4. The desire was noble, but the end result is not worth it. And yes - Tailwind is free, and bashing people on the web is free too - and as per DHH <em>I am not owed anything.</em> But I am entitled to my opinions, and I am well within my right to call out things I consider mistakes. So there.</p>

<p>My personal opinion is that - at least in this case - the adoption of carrier runtime and tooling was not done responsibly.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-the-box-then">What about the box then?</h2>

<p>It’s a mixed bag. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/zpe589/strange_usb_issues_with_mac_studio_thunderbolt/">USB audio drops out on reboot.</a> System Settings <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255870515?sortBy=rank">is a shitshow.</a> Wacom tablet support <a href="https://support.wacom.com/hc/en-us/articles/25915509197335-Does-Wacom-have-a-driver-for-macOS-15-Sequoia">is a drama</a> - and I have to use an older driver version for my Intuos, where the Wacom Center just crashes on startup. The famous <a href="https://x.com/juliknl/status/1905560786799345878">product manager mano-a-mano</a> of <em>Reactions…</em></p>

<p>I can get by. It really is not what I have been dreaming of. And I resent the fact that Tailwind 4 was the thing that made me buy it. It also had to be an older model, because the new ones were on a 4 week backorder in any decent configuration.</p>

<p>Having a CSS pre-processor was not worth that money, and not worth having that resentment.</p>

<h2 id="a-more-important-lesson">A more important lesson</h2>

<p>…for me - is to mute the influencers. There is a list of a handful of folks - they are good folks, but what they are doing is absolutely toxic for what I need to do - namely, build stuff. So I am not only going to go all <code>@levelsio</code> on it and ignore the “best practice” advice – I will also <em>mute</em> all of them. I don’t want to second-guess myself at every <code>bundle add</code> and every <code>brew install</code>. I don’t want to go to sleep with an anxiety that every new tech is going to make me unhireable. And I don’t want to end every day with a feeling that I am a bad developer just because I don’t use nuxt-tailwind-immer-zod-whatever.</p>

<p>Because I know that I can do just fine. If I am allowed space to build.</p>

<p>I know they are not doing this out of malice, but I have to protect my creative spirits at least to some extent.</p>

    <p><span>In the small town of Kawara in Fukuoka Prefecture, something unexpected is happening at the Saidosho Community Center. While kids in most parts of Japan are obsessed with Pokémon cards — or perhaps the franchise’s latest smartphone game, </span><a href="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/entertainment/tech-trends/pokemon-tgc-pocket-continues-to-dominate-the-app-charts/"><span>Pokémon TCG Pocket</span></a><span> — the children of Kawara are clutching to something a little closer to home.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They are playing a trading card game (TCG) where the stars aren’t fantasy creatures, anime heroes or even famous baseball players, but </span><i><span>ojisan</span></i><span> (middle-aged or older men) from the local community of Saidosho.</span></p>

<h2 id="67e2541dad9ce"><span>A Card Game With a Local Twist</span></h2>
<p><span>On the surface, this Ojisan TCG looks like any other collectible card game. As of March 18, there are 47 different cards in the collection, including 28 featuring local men with stats and special abilities.</span></p>
<p><span>Take the Firewall card, for example. It features Mr. Honda (74), a former fire brigade chief who helped keep the town safe for decades. Then there’s Soba Master Mr. Takeshita (81), who runs a local soba noodle-making class and now holds legendary status among the town’s youth.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The most popular of them all is probably All-Rounder Mr. Fujii (68), a former prison officer turned community volunteer. His card is so sought after that local kids have even started asking him for autographs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“I was honestly shocked when they asked me to sign it,” Mr. Fujii said, laughing. “I never imagined I’d become a trading card, let alone have fans.”</span></p>
<p><span>Each card comes with different attacks and an assigned elemental type — just like a classic fantasy card game — but with a humorous, real-world edge. For instance, Firewall is, unsurprisingly, a fire type, equipped with a Super Guard move, which deals a hefty 200 damage.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A card called Plasma Conductor, featuring a smiling, bespectacled ojisan juxtaposed with an image of a lightbulb, is an electric type. At the bottom of the card, there is a line of text explaining how he can fix any electrical appliance without fail.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div id="attachment_265113"><p><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265113" src="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ojisan-02.jpg" alt="ojisan trading cards " width="2880" height="1614" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-src-img="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ojisan-02.jpg" data-src-webp="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ojisan-02.jpg.webp"></p><p id="caption-attachment-265113">Screenshot taken from FNN Prime Online</p></div>
<h2 id="67e2541dad9e0"><span>From Collecting to Battling&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>The creator of the game is Eri Miyahara, the Secretary General of the Saidosho Community Council.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“We wanted to strengthen the connection between the children and the older generations in the community. There are so many amazing people here. I thought it was such a shame that no one knew about them,” she said in</span><a href="https://www.fnn.jp/articles/-/842101"><span> an interview</span></a><span> with </span><i><span>Fuji News Network</span></i><span> (FNN). “Since the card game went viral, so many kids are starting to look up to these men as heroic figures.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The plan worked. Kids have started attending local events and volunteering for community activities — just for a chance to meet the ojisan from their cards. Participation in town events has reportedly doubled since the game launched.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Interestingly, Ojisan TCG didn’t start as a competitive game. The first set of cards was designed purely for collecting, but the local children quickly turned it into something more dynamic. They began comparing stats and declaring, “My card is stronger than yours.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Seeing this, the game’s creator decided to take it to the next level. New rules were introduced, allowing the cards to be used in actual battles. The objective isn’t to defeat the opponent’s card but to outplay it based on the characters’ skills and abilities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The rarity of a card isn’t based on fantasy stats — it’s tied to real-world contributions. The more actively the ojisan engages in volunteer work or community service, the higher the chances of their card being upgraded to a shiny version with a glossy laminated effect.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While the cards — all made entirely by hand — are currently in high demand and often out of stock, they are only available for sale at the Saidosho Community Center.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A pack of three cards costs ¥100, while a pack of six cards — including a shiny card — costs ¥500. Despite the limited supply, demand remains high, with many kids saving their pocket money for a chance to score a shiny version of their favorite ojisan.</span></p>
