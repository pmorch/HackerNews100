<p><strong>“I’ve been waiting over 20 years for an environmentally friendly successor to Concorde and XB-1’s first flight is a major landmark towards my dreams being realized. When I last flew Concorde in 2003 I knew that this day would come. The first flight of the XB-1 supersonic demonstrator is a significant achievement toward making sustainable supersonic flight a reality, aboard Overture – my #1 choice as the successor to Concorde,”</strong> said Captain Mike Bannister, former Chief Concorde Pilot for British Airways. “Congratulations to Blake Scholl, all at Boom and especially its pilot, Bill “Doc” Shoemaker. Having been Concorde’s Chief Pilot I envy his role in this exciting return towards mainstream supersonic flight.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The XB-1 program provides the foundation for Overture’s design and development, while establishing a safety-first culture in engineering and manufacturing. XB-1 validates key technologies and Boom’s own innovations, including:</p>

<p>It is fitting that XB-1 took off for the first time from the Mojave Air &amp; Space Port, in airspace known as the home of many firsts in the world of aviation and aerospace. This region in the Mojave Desert is the proving grounds for the aerospace industry, where an aircraft broke the sound barrier for the first time in 1947 and where speed and altitude records are set.</p>



<p>Now that XB-1 has successfully completed its first flight, the team will systematically expand the flight envelope to confirm its performance and handling qualities through and beyond Mach 1. When XB-1 is ready for its first supersonic flight, Test Pilot Tristan “Geppetto” Brandenberg will be at the controls.</p>







<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1440" height="810" src="https://boomsupersonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/xb-1-flyby-first-flight-15-1440x810.jpg" alt="Boom's supersonic demonstrator, XB-1 taxiing the runway at Mojave Air &amp; Space Port in preparation for first flight." srcset="https://boomsupersonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/xb-1-flyby-first-flight-15-1440x810.jpg 1440w, https://boomsupersonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/xb-1-flyby-first-flight-15-768x432.jpg 768w, https://boomsupersonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/xb-1-flyby-first-flight-15-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://boomsupersonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/xb-1-flyby-first-flight-15-160x90.jpg 160w, https://boomsupersonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/xb-1-flyby-first-flight-15.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px"></figure>







<p>The inaugural flight of XB-1 takes place as <a href="https://boomsupersonic.com/overture">Overture</a> continues to advance toward production, with a growing global network of Tier 1 suppliers and an order book including 130 orders and pre-orders from American Airlines, United Airlines, and Japan Airlines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Congratulations to Boom on the XB-1’s first flight,” said Akasaka Yuji, Representative Director, CEO Japan Airlines. “I am looking forward to seeing your realization of sustainable supersonic flight to and from Japan.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overture will carry 64-80 passengers at Mach 1.7, about twice the speed of today’s subsonic airliners. Optimized for speed, safety, and sustainability, Overture is designed to run on up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).</p>



<p>“Boom Supersonic’s remarkable achievements are a testament to the power of dreaming and doing,” said Amy Spowart, President &amp; CEO of The National Aeronautical Association. “Like Sir Frank Whittle, Blake, and Boom, achieved what others tried and no other could with XB-1. Congratulations to the XB-1 team, including Chief Test Pilot, Bill “Doc” Shoemaker! The National Aeronautic Association looks forward to celebrating your milestones in the historic fashion of the shoulders on which we all stand.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/releases/tag/1.0.0">https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/releases/tag/1.0.0</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39790365">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true"><p>Bulma v1 is a <strong>full rewrite</strong> of the framework using <a href="https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Dart Sass</strong></a>, which is the the primary implementation of Sass. While this affects a few development details, everything has been done to make the transition <strong>as easy as possible</strong>.</p>
<h2>What remains the same</h2>
<p><strong>All HTML snippets are the same</strong>. This means you don't need to update your markup. <strong>This is important</strong> because it means, if you're using Bulma straight "out of the box", you don't need to change anything.</p>
<p>You can just swap <code>bulma@0.9.4/css/bulma.min.css</code> with <code>bulma@1.0.0/css/bulma.min.css</code> and everything will work. Things will look slightly different, but they will still work.</p>
<h2>What changes</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Dart Sass</strong></a> is used to build Bulma
<ul>
<li>if you use the <code>sass</code> npm package, you're already using Dart Sass</li>
</ul>

Airport construction is nearly always vigorously opposed by various interest groups, often successfully. As air travel greatly expanded in the 1960s and 70s, there were “no more virulent domestic conflicts… in the advanced industrial world than those over airport construction.” In her history of US airports in the second half of the 20th century, Janet Bednarek notes that building a new airport was so “extraordinarily difficult…that very few completely new major commercial airports were constructed." Of the 50 largest airports in the US, the average age is 82 years, and only three have been built in the last 50 years.

Not only did airports need to be enlarged to handle the rise in passengers and aircraft moving through them, but jet airliners required much longer runways to take off and land than propeller planes did. Lockheed’s </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Constellation" rel="">Constellation</a><span>, a 4-engine propeller airliner which entered service in 1943, needed a 6000 foot-long runway, but the Boeing 707 needed more than 10,000 feet at full takeoff weight, as did the Boeing 747 which followed 10 years later. In 1957 an American Airlines executive stated that not a single airport the company flew to could fully accommodate the new jets, either because of insufficient runway length or insufficient terminal facilities. Many believed that the new jet airliners would require their own special “jetports” built specifically to accommodate them.</span></p><p>Expanding aviation infrastructure to handle jets proved difficult. The most important reason was noise. Residents near airports had long complained about the noise from planes: in 1948, when what would become JFK International opened, residents from 18 civic organizations protested the noise from low flying planes. But noise from jet aircraft proved to be a much more severe problem. The Air Force jets under development in the 1950s were expected to be “the loudest man-made industrial noise up to now.” And while tests of commercial jet aircraft showed that they weren’t necessarily noisier than comparable prop airplanes (tests comparing the 707 to the Lockheed Constellation measured similar noise levels), the high-pitched frequencies of jet engine noise were discovered to be far more disturbing to human ears than piston engines were.

In 1961, the FAA put out a pamphlet, “The Sounds of the 20th Century,” aimed at explaining why jet engines made noise, and emphasizing the many benefits that air transportation brought, in the hopes that understanding would breed acceptance. When questioned about aircraft noise by a US congressman in 1962, the head of the FAA stated that “we feel the statement that people must live with noise is realistic in the light of our growing society using complex means of transportation and communication. Noise in urban America is one of the prices paid for progress and economic growth."</span></p><p><span>But despite these hopes, it was clear to most that jet noise was a serious problem, with the “potential to impede air commerce in the USA”. A year after the introduction of the first commercial jets, congressional hearings were held on </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=n5pabnp2yGQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=jet+engine+noise&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwin6pj_5YqEAxW8kmoFHTU4CMI4ChDoAXoECAcQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=jet%20engine%20noise&amp;f=false" rel="">aircraft noise problems</a><span>, and the following year the FAA acknowledged that the introduction of jet airliners had led to “a substantial increase in the number of complaints from persons in the airport environment, as well as adverse community reaction to turbojet noise at a number of major airports.” Jet noise became such a problem at LAX that appraisals for property values near the airport dropped as much as 20%</span></p><p>Jet airliners were also introduced during a time when citizens were increasingly skeptical of progress at any cost, and of the decisions made by unaccountable government technocrats. Opposition to airports was joined by opposition against highway construction, dams, nuclear reactors, and other technology and infrastructure that activists felt was misdirected progress. Noise began to be considered another harmful pollutant by the burgeoning environmental movement.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Citizens increasingly filed lawsuits against airports for damages, in some cases even attempting </span><a href="https://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2506&amp;context=jalc" rel="">injunctions to stop the use of jets</a><span>. In 1961, 800 homeowners in Queens sued the Port Authority for $2 million in damages from aircraft noise, though the suit was ultimately discontinued for lack of funds. In 1966, one irate housewife threatened to blow up JFK’s aircraft control tower. The FAA was so concerned about reactions to jet noise in Washington DC that it didn’t authorize jets to land there </span><a href="https://wwws.law.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/events/colloquium/legal-history/documents/grisinger-draft-nu-workshop-feb-2-2022.pdf" rel="">until 1966</a><span>. In response to political pressure, jet noise bills were continually introduced in congress, and in 1968 a bill was passed that authorized the FAA to include noise levels as part of its criteria for certifying new aircraft.</span></p><p>By the time the FAA bill passed, technology was already helping to solve the noise problem. The first generation of jet airliners used turbojet engines, in which air enters the engine, gets compressed, burned, and is exhausted out at supersonic speed. It was this supersonic exhaust which created the lion’s share of jet engine noise. But in the late 1950s, a new type of jet engine was developed, the turbofan. Unlike the turbojet (where all the air enters the combustion chamber and is burned) a turbofan has a large fan mounted to the front that pulls air into the engine but around the combustion chamber (because this air bypasses the combustion chamber, turbofans are also called bypass engines). The turbofan extracted much more energy from the hot exhaust of the combustion chamber, leading to a colder exhaust stream. Not only was this more fuel efficient (jet engines are most efficient when the speed of their exhaust matches the cruising speed of the aircraft), but they were much quieter than turbojets. By 1961, turbofans had replaced turbojets on all new commercial jets.&nbsp;</p><p>And while turbofans were being developed, NASA was conducting research on technologies that could be used to quiet jet engines, such as redesigned engine nacelles and fan blades. As a result of this technology and research, and of slowly increasing stringency of FAA noise regulations after 1968, the noise of jet engines steadily fell.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png" width="1086" height="638" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:638,&quot;width&quot;:1086,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Airliner noise over time. Via “Aircraft Noise Technology For The 21st Century.”</figcaption></figure></div><p>But the decreasing noise of individual jet engines was partially offset by continuously rising jet traffic. In 1960, just 16 airports in the US had jet service; by 1970, that had risen to more than 300. Between 1962 and 1970, the number of jet aircraft used by US airlines rose by a factor of five. And the more passengers on a jet, the harder the engines had to work, and the more noise they made.</p><p><span>Despite improvements from turbofans and other technology, complaints against jet noise showed no signs of abating. In the two years after jets were introduced at National Airport (now Ronald Reagan) in Washington DC, the FAA received more than 6000 letters from angry citizens. By 1968, LAX was facing three billion dollars in lawsuits over jet noise. By 1972, noise in the US (much of it jet related) generated more complaints than “any other pollutant or threat to the environment,” and experts worried that “violent civil disobedience at airports [was] a real possibility in the near future.” In the mid-1970s, millions of people were exposed to average aircraft noise levels exceeding 65 decibels (the level at which noise is the “most important adverse aspect of the environment”), and airports around the country were facing </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=yEawSy0hDn8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=number+of+lawsuits+against+airport+noise&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjDmMOQzMSEAxUe4skDHV1BCJIQ6AF6BAgMEAI#v=onepage&amp;q=lawsuit&amp;f=false" rel="">hundreds of millions of dollars in lawsuits</a><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-142268420" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-is-it-so-hard-to-build-an-airport#footnote-2-142268420" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p>Besides improving engine technology, other solutions to the noise problem could likewise only partially address the issue. Airports could route planes over less inhabited areas, but there was often limited ability to do this. At JFK, for instance, the Port Authority tried to limit takeoffs to runways which faced over the water, but this wasn’t possible if traffic was high enough or winds weren’t favorable. Airports could also mandate takeoff and landing procedures that minimized noise impact, such as “low altitude, reduced power climbs, [and] higher angles of descent," but pilots resisted many of these, claiming they were unsafe. Reduced noise procedures were thought to be responsible for at least one crash at JFK.</p><p>Legal rulings and federal government policy also constrained how airports and municipalities could address problems of aircraft noise. Courts had established that exposing a property to aircraft noise constituted a “taking” that required compensation (dating from a 1946 case in which low-flying military jets caused a farmer's chickens to kill themselves as they ran into the walls in fright). And they had also established that airport owners were responsible for the noise that they generated. But even as the courts assigned responsibility for noise to airports, they greatly restricted what airports could do about it. Airport rules that limited night takeoffs and landings, for instance, were often overturned, with courts ruling that air traffic fell under the jurisdiction of the FAA. Zoning rules near airports that might limit noise exposure were also often struck down as not beneficial to the general public. And though airports lobbied for a federal noise abatement policy (in part to reduce their own liability), the government resisted, and the FAA carefully structured its aircraft noise rules to avoid taking any responsibility for implementing noise restrictions.</p><p><span>Ultimately airports were left with little choice but to install soundproofing in residences near airports, and to acquire parcels of land via eminent domain that were too affected by noise. This often resulted in airports buying hundreds or even thousands of homes in adjacent areas and demolishing them.

But this has also proved difficult. While some airports, such as Chicago’s Midway, Boston Logan, and New York’s LaGuardia were built close (or even within) the cities they served (before jets made such construction infeasible), many others were built far from the city, only to have the city eventually expand around it. O’Hare (which began as an aircraft factory for Douglas Aircraft in WWII) was originally built on farmland relatively far from Chicago, but post-war sprawl pushed development outward, and by the late 1960s O’Hare had some of the most severe noise problems in the country. Denver International Airport was likewise deliberately built far from Denver on an enormous empty plot of land in a partially successful attempt to minimize noise issues.</p><p>And an airport can’t be too far from a city and remain useful, since travelers need to access the city, workers need to be within commuting distance, and so on. In Canada, Mirabel airport was built 35 miles from Montreal, surrounded by a 79,000 acre buffer zone to prevent any issues of incompatible land use. Mirabel was expected to replace Dorval (today Montreal-Trudeau) as Canada’s main eastern airport, but, in part because of its long distance from the city, this never happened, and Mirabel stopped serving passenger traffic in 2004.</p><p><span>In addition to the noise problem, this sheer size of airports makes building them near cities difficult. Though early airfields were often small (when Chicago Midway opened, it took up just 80 acres, and by the 1950s it was the busiest airport in the world on 650 acres of space), a modern airport needs thousands of acres. Runways are two miles or more in length, and require thousands of feet of space between them to allow simultaneous landing of planes. This, along with the additional land needed to be acquired as a noise buffer, means that airports are “the largest land using facilities on the urban periphery,” often the size of a city in their own right. In the early 1980s, Dallas Fort-Worth Airport covered as much land as the city of Dallas did, and Denver International Airport is </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/7xkefe/the_actual_size_of_denver_international_airport/" rel="">as large</a><span> as the city of San Francisco. In addition to the difficulty of finding this much space, an airport perversely both creates demand for more housing (for the workers, along with whatever increase in commerce the airport causes) while removing thousands of acres of space for it.</span></p><p>The noise problem means that building a new airport is strongly resisted by local residents. But residents aren’t the only ones opposing airport construction. They’re also fought by environmentalists. In addition to the noise they generate, the size of airports means building one will encroach on what might be ecologically valuable areas such as forests or wetlands, damaging them even if they’re just used for a noise buffer (the risk of bird strikes means that the ideal airport is one surrounded by “sterilized fields” where birds aren’t inclined to nest). The huge amount of jet fuel that flows through an airport creates the risk of leaks and spills. Decades of fuel spills at JFK resulted in a “vast lake of jet fuel” beneath the airport, anywhere from 5 million to 9 million gallons in size.</p><p><span>Environmental opposition has thus been a major factor in limiting airport construction. Environmental groups like the Sierra Club have opposed new airports at Palmdale in California and near Minneapolis in Minnesota. Environmental opposition stopped both the expansion of JFK (which would require filling in portions of Jamaica Bay) and the construction of a new fourth airport in the New York region. It stopped a small training facility near the Everglades from becoming the </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/everglades-jetport-florida-cmd/index.html" rel="">largest airport in the world</a><span>. Environmental opposition to airports has been greatly aided by the passage of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in 1969: NEPA has been leveraged to oppose, </span><a href="https://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1274&amp;context=jalc" rel="">among other things</a><span>, the construction of the Denver International Airport, and the expansion of Oakland, Anchorage, and O’Hare airports.</span></p><p>New airport construction is also often resisted by airlines themselves, which have invested significant money in their terminal facilities at existing airports. Similarly, where airlines have a “fortress hub” (an airport whose traffic is mostly captured by a single airline), they will often resist new airports as a threat to their dominance. Delta, for instance, opposed the construction of a new airport in Atlanta that would have been used by Southwest Airlines.</p><p><span>The factors that make it hard to build a new airport also make it hard to expand an existing airport. Often, urban encroachment means an airport has no feasible room to grow, like at Chicago’s Midway and New York’s La Guardia. If it is possible to expand, such expansion will invariably be protested vigorously by residents and environmental groups. Protest against expansion of JFK by filling in Jamaica Bay has kept the airport at roughly the same size since it was first built in 1948. The construction of an additional runway at Boston Logan was </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_International_Airport" rel="">successfully resisted</a><span> for over 30 years, and a new runway at Sea-Tac was </span><a href="https://www.historylink.org/file/4211" rel="">resisted for 16 years</a><span>. Local and environmental opposition prevented the expansion of LAX in the late 1990s. Chicago had such a difficult time overcoming opposition to expanding O’Hare that it asked the federal government to force such an expansion through legislation. A </span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-03-164.pdf" rel="">GAO report</a><span> found that, on average, it took 10 to 15 years for a US airport to complete a new runway.&nbsp;</span></p><p>And airports around the world don’t seem to fare much better. Heathrow in London has been trying for more than 50 years to add a third runway. And while between 2008 and 2016, the 4000+ commercial airports around the world added around 400 new runways, zero runways were added at the top 100 airports by traffic (which handle roughly half of all air travel).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png" width="731" height="345" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:345,&quot;width&quot;:731,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Via GAO.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Their enormous size, along with their noise and other negative environmental impacts, makes a new airport the ultimate in NIMBY (not-in-my-backyard) infrastructure: people are fine with having an airport, but will fiercely resist having an airport built near them. Most NIMBY difficulties stem from the asymmetric nature of the costs and benefits of a new project: a new apartment building, for instance, will benefit a city overall (slightly lowering housing costs and slightly increasing the size of the city’s labor market), but those benefits are diffuse. The costs, on the other hand – traffic, parking, construction disruption – will be borne almost entirely by the surrounding residents, who will thus rationally oppose it.</p><p>An airport pushes this dynamic to the extreme. The disruption to the immediate area is immense, due to the size of the airport and the negative impacts of noise, not to mention the increased traffic that an airport generates. The benefits, on the other hand, are diffuse. While the region and state benefit from the economic activity the airport generates, many of the benefits of an airport accrue to the entire country, in the form of a better functioning aviation system, with fewer delays to passengers nationwide. Expanding capacity at O’Hare might reduce congestion at other hubs far from the city of Chicago. Similarly, not only are many of the users of an airport tourists who don’t live in the area, but at hub airports they might merely pass through without interacting with the local region at all.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike much other US infrastructure, modern, large airports that serve commercial jets only became needed as the environmental movement gained steam and building things in general became hard. Thus, building a major commercial airport has always been difficult: there has never been a "golden age of airport building."</p><p>Given the difficulty of building or expanding airports, how has the US (and other countries) managed to steadily expand the volume of air traffic without catastrophic congestion?&nbsp;</p><p><span>For one, despite the difficulty, airports have been able to add new runways.

This is important, as an additional runway brings more capacity gain than any other sort of airport improvement. Airports have also rebuilt their infrastructure to squeeze more capacity without needing any additional land area. Airports such as JFK, Atlanta-Hartsfield, and O’Hare, for instance, have removed cross-runways and added parallel runways to allow for simultaneous landing of aircraft, increasing the volume of aircraft the airport can handle. Airports have also been able to build more terminals and more gates, and added technologies like jetways, automatic baggage handlers, and people movers that move people through the airport faster.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png" width="437" height="711.1586608442503" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1118,&quot;width&quot;:687,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:437,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Evolution of runway layout at JFK over time. Via The Metropolitan Airport</figcaption></figure></div><p>An important measure of airport capacity is “plane movements” – how many takeoffs and landings an airport can support over a period of time. This is typically limited by runway capacity. But even if no runways are added and the number of plane movements remains fixed, capacity can be increased by raising the number of passengers per plane. Many airports, for instance, created policies to discourage general aviation aircraft, freeing up room for higher-capacity commercial planes. In 1968 the New York Port Authority greatly increased the landing fees for small aircraft, which resulted in general aviation traffic declining by 30% over the next few months. This was followed by the FAA imposing quotas on general aviation traffic at five major airports, which had a similar effect.</p><p><span>Similarly, commercial aircraft have steadily gotten larger over time. In the 1960s, international routes were limited to the Boeing 707 or the DC-8, which had a maximum capacity of 174 and 269 passengers respectively, but the 1970s saw the introduction of the Boeing 747 which initially could seat 366 passengers. And besides introducing new, larger models, individual models also got larger over time: stretching an aircraft to get more passengers has long been a strategy for aircraft builders. When the 737 was first introduced, it had a capacity of up to 130 passengers. Today, a 737-MAX10 can have up to 230 passengers. And average aircraft capacity seems to still be rising: between 2000 and 2016, average seat capacity on flights around the world increased by 31%. Airlines have also gotten better at filling their aircraft to capacity. In 1970, commercial aircraft were on average just 49% full. Today, that has </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/658830/passenger-load-factor-of-commercial-airlines-worldwide/#:~:text=Global%20airlines'%20combined%20passenger%20load,to%2081%20percent%20in%202023." rel="">risen to more than 80%</a><span>. These all increase the number of passengers transported per airplane, and thus allows more passenger volume from the same number of runways.</span></p><p>As airports have become congested, traffic has often shifted towards other airports that have more capacity. Inability to add capacity has caused Boston Logan to begin redirecting traffic to other, regional airports. This sort of shift is often facilitated by the hub-and-spoke network of US air travel: since the hub isn’t the final destination, it's often possible for airlines to shift routes to go through different hubs if one becomes congested. As O’Hare became congested, for instance, some airlines shifted routes to other hubs at St. Louis and Denver.</p><p><span>Finally, capacity can be increased by changes in air traffic control and how planes are routed. Significant congestion issues at European airports in the late 1980s were resolved by </span><a href="https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/full/10.5555/19951810318" rel="">improvements</a><span> to the air traffic control system. In the US, the </span><a href="https://reason.org/policy-study/increasing-airport-capacity-wi/" rel="">NextGen air traffic control program</a><span> was created to expand air transportation capacity, which does things like researching </span><a href="https://www.volpe.dot.gov/news/new-aircraft-separation-standards-gain-wider-adoption-saving-time-and-money" rel="">wake turbulence</a><span> to see if required aircraft separation distances can be safely reduced. Similarly, airport congestion often only occurs at limited peak hours, and capacity can be increased by shifting flights to non-peak hours (though airline resistance might make this difficult).</span></p><p><span>One benefit that airports do have for increasing capacity is that, unlike </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/a-cycle-of-misery-the-business-of" rel="">many other aspects</a><span> of the air transportation system, they’re very profitable.

On the one hand, building the infrastructure for it is unbelievably difficult. Airports are incredibly hard to build, aircraft are incredibly hard to make a profit selling, airlines are frequently going bankrupt. And yet this hasn’t stopped air travel from steadily becoming cheaper, safer, more convenient and more ubiquitous. The pre-jet era, when aircraft and airports could be developed without spending billions of dollars, was also the era where air travel was noisy, inconvenient, and reserved for a relatively small number of people. It was somehow brought to the masses, transformed from a miracle to a modern convenience even as every aspect of it steadily got closer and closer to being impossible to achieve.</p><p><span>If you’re interested in reading more about airport building, a reading list of the major sources I found useful is </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/airport-reading-list" rel="">available here</a><span> for paid subscribers.</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What if you could take every law, regulation and case in Australia and project them onto a two-dimensional map such that their distance from one another was proportional to their similarity in meaning? What would that look like?</p><p>Perhaps something like this.</p><div id="oalm-mobile"><figure> <img decoding="async" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/oalm/map.oalm.svg" alt="The first ever map of Australian law." data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure><p> <em>Note: since you’re on a mobile device, the map has been replaced with a screenshot. Hop on a computer to experience the map in all its interactive glory.</em></p></div><p>This is the first ever map of Australian law. Each point represents a unique law, regulation or case in the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/umarbutler/open-australian-legal-corpus">Open Australian Legal Corpus</a>, the world’s largest open source database of Australian law (you can learn about how I built that corpus <a href="https://umarbutler.com/how-i-built-the-largest-open-database-of-australian-law/">here</a>).</p><p>The closer any two documents are on the map, the more similar they are in meaning.</p><p>If you’re on a computer and hover over a document, you’ll see its title, type, jurisdiction and category. You can open a document by clicking on it.</p><p>Documents are coloured by category. The legend on the right shows what colour each category correspond to. Click on a category and you’ll exclude it from the map. Double click and you’ll only see documents from that category.</p><p>Over the course of this article, I’ll cover exactly what the map can teach us about Australian law as well as give you a behind-the-scenes look at how I built it, providing code examples along the way. Those more interested in the technology powering the map can skip straight to that section <a href="#so-howd-you-do-it" data-type="internal" data-id="#so-howd-you-do-it">here</a>.</p><h2>What can we learn from it?</h2><p>While it might not look like much at first, the map gives us a rare look into some of the many hidden ways Australian laws, regulations and cases are both connected to and disconnected from one another.</p><h3><em>The invisible barrier between cases and legislation</em></h3><p>It is readily observable, for example, that there is a sort of invisible barrier separating cases on the one hand from legislation on the other. This barrier corresponds roughly with the map’s north and south poles.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/types.map_.oalm_-2.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><em>An annotated version of the map where cases and legislation are enclosed in two shapes corresponding with the map’s north and south poles, respectively.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The presence of this barrier tells us that documents of the same type will tend to share more in common with each other than they will with documents of the same subject matter.</p><p>Although they may often focus on the same topics, cases and legislation are, after all, written in different styles, towards different ends.</p><h3>The absence of borders between documents of different jurisdictions</h3><p>Interestingly, however, we find no such borders between documents of different jurisdictions; although, it is worth noting, due to copyright restrictions, the Open Australian Legal Corpus only contains decisions from the Commonwealth and New South Wales and is missing legislation from Victoria, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/jurisdictions.annotated.map_.oalm_.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><em>An alternate view of the map where documents are coloured by jurisdiction, illustrating the lack of boundaries between documents of different jurisdictions.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The absence of borders between cases and legislation of different jurisdictions indicates that Australian state and federal law is relatively homogenous. There are no differences between the style, principles of interpretation or general jurisprudence of state and federal law that appear to be reflected in the map. Of what borders do exist between state and federal law, they correspond better with differences in subject matter than they do with the jurisprudence of their jurisdictions.</p><p>This conforms with fact that state and federal courts and legislatures operate within a single legal framework, under which they have jurisdiction over matters prescribed by the Constitution in their territory, with a single court, the High Court of Australia, arbitrating on disputes between governments over the precise limits of those constitutional rights and powers.</p><h3>The judicial and legislative mainlands and islands</h3><p>Turning back to the barrier between cases and legislation, we also observe that, within the map’s north and south poles, each pole has a ‘mainland’ of sorts that most documents belong to, and then there are a range of ‘islands’ that orbit those mainlands, typically consisting of documents of the same subject matter.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/islands.map_.oalm_.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><em>An annotated version of the map where ‘islands’ of documents of the same subject matter are enclosed in shapes that orbit ‘mainlands’ of cases and legislation.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The fact that there are judicial and legislative mainlands suggests that most cases and legislation draw from and feed into a single, interconnected pool of knowledge.</p><p>This is not particularly surprising. What is surprising is that there are large islands of legislation and judgments that are entirely cut off from their respective mainlands.</p><p><a href="https://www.abf.gov.au/importing-exporting-and-manufacturing/tariff-concessions-system/tariff-concession-order">Tariff concession orders</a>, for example, form their very own unique archipelago, perhaps because each order is centred around regulating a distinct, often quite technical class of importable goods, from <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2007L04317/latest/text">magazine holders</a> to <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2007L00538/latest/text">forklifts</a>.</p><p>There is also quite a sizeable island of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airworthiness_Directive">airworthiness directives</a> primarily focused on regulating aircraft components, another highly technical domain.</p><p>Somewhat unexpectedly, the largest island by surface area consists almost entirely of migration cases. Furthermore, of all 19 possible branches of law, migration and family law are the only two to be found more often outside a mainland than inside one.</p><p>Migration and family law are, in effect, the most isolated areas of Australian law on the map.</p><p>Funnily enough, while researching why that might be, I stumbled upon this rather pertinent quote from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Sumption,_Lord_Sumption">Lord Sumption</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Courts exercising family jurisdiction do not occupy a <em>desert island</em> in which general legal concepts are suspended or mean something different. If a right of property exists, it exists in every division of the High Court and in every jurisdiction of the county courts. If it does not exist, it does not exist anywhere.</p><p><a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2013-0004.html"><em>Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd</em></a> [2013] UKSC 34, [37] (emphasis added)</p></blockquote><p>I also discovered that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Munby">Munby LJ</a>, later President of the UK Family Division, had likewise once quipped:</p><blockquote><p>The Family Division is part of the High Court. It is not some legal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitefriars,_London#Alsatia">Alsatia</a> where the common law and equity do not apply. The rules of agency apply there as much as elsewhere. But in applying those rules one must have regard to the context …</p><p><em><a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/79.html">Richardson v Richardson</a></em> [2011] EWCA Civ 79, [53]</p></blockquote><p>It would seem that there was already a <a href="https://www.iclr.co.uk/blog/commentary/family-law-no-island-entire-unto-itself/">perception</a> that family law is somewhat isolated from the rest of the law, which the map appears to support.</p><p>As for migration law, although I was unable to locate equally apropos quotes, from my own review of a selection of cases on the map, they appear relatively self-contained in that they tend to reference legislation and cases particular to migration law. It also makes sense that migration law would be a little distant from other areas of law given its unique subject matter.</p><p>While not as insular as family and migration law, it is also worth addressing the relatively large hexagram-shaped island of criminal law, which features a tail of transport and administrative law cases coming out of it.</p><p>That island appears to consist mostly of substantive criminal law cases (along with certain punitive transport and administrative law cases focused on the suspension of various types of licences), whereas the criminal law cases connected to the judicial mainland tend to concern criminal procedure.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/criminal.annotated.map_.oalm_.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><em>An annotated version of criminal law cases with the island of substantive criminal law cases and the cluster of procedural criminal law cases connected to the judicial mainland enclosed in their own shapes. Only light blue data points are criminal cases.</em></figcaption></figure><p>This supports the broad division of substantive law into criminal law and civil law while also conforming well with the fact that criminal procedure law and civil procedure law share a number of common principles of natural justice.</p><h3>The most and least legislative areas of judicial law</h3><p>Fascinatingly, migration, family and substantive criminal law also all tend to cluster closely together latitudinally, hinting at potential hidden connection. They are all known to overlap in certain ways and they all share a special focus on regulating the lives of individuals, and not merely the property rights of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person">legal persons</a>.</p><p>Migration, family and substantive criminal law cases also all happen to be the most distant types of cases from legislation on the map. Of course, this does not mean that they never cite legislation, but it may be that they rely on precedent more often than other areas of case law. It might also be the result of the inherent difficulty in attempting to represent highly complex and multidimensional relationships in a simple two-dimensional map.</p><p>Conversely, the class of cases closest to legislation is development cases, which makes sense since they can often deal quite intimately with local planning laws and regulations.</p><h3>The case law continuum</h3><p>If we start at the bottom of the cases mainland and make our way up, we can also see that Australian case law is a continuum of sorts.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/judicial-mainland.annotated-1.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><em>An annotated version of the case law mainland where select branches of law are pointed out, illustrating the continuum of case law.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Development cases connect with environmental cases, which then link with land cases.</p><p>Land cases border contract cases which in turn have procedural cases to their north, intellectual property cases to their west and commercial cases to their east.</p><p>Moving further north of procedural law brings you to criminal law and defamation.</p><p>Heading west from intellectual property law takes you through administrative law, health and social services law, employment law, negligence and finally transport law.</p><p>Going east of commercial law, you’ll find equity and a subset of family law.</p><figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="2236" height="1258" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/compressed_animation.webp" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/compressed_animation.webp"><figcaption><em>An animation of branches of law appearing on the map sequentially, illustrating the continuum of case law.</em></figcaption></figure><p>This continuum corresponds well with our pre-existing understandings of the relationships between the various branches of the law.</p><p>It makes sense, for example, that development, environment and land law would all be intertwined given their similar subject matter. Likewise, it is not at all unexpected that negligence would cluster closely with transport and employment law when a great many negligence cases centre around motor and workplace accident claims.</p><p>The map, in effect, crystallises our own mental models of the law.</p><p>It also shows us that the borders between various areas of the law can often be quite porous. We notice, for instance, that there is a streak of land law judgments that overlaps with commercial and procedural law cases and is disconnected from most other land law cases. Interestingly, cases in this streak tend to focus on mortgage disputes often involving defaults which would explain why they overlap with commercial and procedural law cases.</p><p>We can also see that there are some transport law judgments that are connected to the cases mainland and then there are others that are connected to the island of substantive criminal law cases. Transport judgments connected to that island often centre around the suspension of transport licences, whereas judgments connected to the cases mainland tend to focus on transport accidents. Although disconnected from one another, however, both clusters of transport cases are still relatively close to each other, reflecting their shared subject matter.</p><h3>Final thoughts</h3><p>By now, we’ve covered how the map reflects already known distinctions between cases and legislation, while also revealing potential new divisions and hidden connections between various areas of the law. We’ve also seen how Australian case law can be more of a continuum than a rigidly defined structure and how the borders between branches of case law can often be quite porous.</p><p>Other specific insights we’ve been able to find are that:</p><ul><li>Migration, family and substantive criminal law are the most isolated branches of case law on the map;</li><li>Migration, family and substantive criminal law are the most distant branches of case law from legislation on the map;</li><li>Development law is the closest branch of case law to legislation on the map; and</li><li>The map does not reveal any noticeable distinctions between Australian state and federal law, whether it be in style, principles of interpretation or general jurisprudence.</li></ul><p>These are but a selection of the most readily observable insights to be gained from attempting to map Australian law. There are no doubt countless others waiting to be uncovered. Producing a three-dimensional map of Australian laws, cases and regulations could, for example, reveal new hidden relationships that are almost impossible to represent in two dimensions. Adding cases and legislation from other states and territories might also give us a sharper, higher resolution image of the map, deepening our understanding of the geography of Australian law. One could even imagine adding legal documents from other common law countries such as the UK, Canada and New Zealand to, in a sense, photograph the historic and continued interactions between our legal systems.</p><p>Nevertheless, for a first attempt, the map already has a lot to teach us. Perhaps you’ve even identified patterns in the map that I could not.</p><p>The greatest thing about this exercise is that it can be applied to virtually any domain, not just Australian law. Semantic mapping is particularly useful for very quickly developing an understanding of the underlying composition and structure of a dataset without having to manually scour through hundreds of examples to build your own much noisier and less persistent mental model of that data.</p><p>Since finishing the map, I’ve already been able to reuse this technique to study countless other seemingly unstructured large datasets, and you can too. It doesn’t take an expert in clustering and mapping to pull it off. Far from it. Prior to starting this project, I didn’t know the first thing about semantic mapping and now I’m about to teach you how to do it yourself.</p><h2 id="so-howd-you-do-it">So how’d you do it?</h2><p>At a high level, the process for mapping any arbitrary set of data points, whether they be PDFs, YouTube videos, TikToks or anything else, can be broken down into six stages, illustrated below.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/process.oalm_.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><em>An illustration of the process of semantically mapping data.</em></figcaption></figure><p>In brief, we try to represent the meaning of data in the form of sets of numbers (<em>vectorisation</em>), after which we group those sets into clusters based on their similarity (<em>clustering</em>) and subsequently label those clusters based on whatever unique patterns we can find in them (<em>labelling</em>). Finally, we project the numerical representations of the data into two-dimensional coordinates (<em>dimensionality reduction</em>) which we then plot on a map (<em>visualisation</em>).</p><p>Through this next section, we’ll take a deeper look at exactly how every step of the semantic mapping process works in practice. Before that though, I’d like to express my gratitude to the creators of <a href="https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BERTopic</a>, a topic modelling technique which this process was loosely based on, as well as <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mikedelong">Dr Mike DeLong</a> whose <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/mikedelong/australian-law-topics">topic map</a> of the Open Australian Legal Corpus served as the inspiration for this entire project.</p><h3>Vectorisation</h3><p>The first step in semantically mapping a dataset is to vectorise its data points.</p><p>In this context, <em>vectorisation</em> refers to the process of converting information into a set of numbers intended to represent its underlying meaning, known as a <em>vector</em> or <em>embedding</em>. By calculating how similar vectors are to one another, we can also get a rough idea of how similar they are in meaning. This principle is what allows us to later group data points into clusters and project them onto a two-dimensional map.</p><p>To vectorise a data point, we can use an <em>embedding model</em>, a model specially trained for the task of representing the meaning of information as vectors. Thankfully, for my uses and probably yours too, it isn’t necessary to train a custom embedding model or pay someone to use theirs. At least for text vectorisation, most of the world’s best models are already available for free and under open-source licences.</p><p>Hugging Face helpfully maintains a ranked list of the most accurate text embedding models as benchmarked against hundreds of datasets, known as the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard">Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Leaderboard</a>. When I built the map, <code><a href="https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5">BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5</a></code> was one of the best open-source models available for its size, so that’s what I went with. Nowadays, <code><a href="https://huggingface.co/avsolatorio/GIST-small-Embedding-v0">avsolatorio/GIST-small-Embedding-v0</a></code> (a finetune of that model) ranks higher, but its worth checking out the leaderboard yourself as new models are released every day.</p><p>One constraint of contemporary text embedding models worth keeping in mind is that they can only vectorise a fixed number of <em>tokens</em>, known as a <em>context window</em>. If you don’t know what a token is, you can think of it as the most basic unit of input a text model can take. There are roughly 0.75 tokens in a word. So, if a text embedding model’s context window is 512 tokens like <code>GIST-small-Embedding-v0</code>‘s is, then you can only vectorise roughly 384 words at a time.</p><p>To get around this, we can split text into chunks up to 512 tokens long, vectorise each chunk and then average those vectors to produce a mean text embedding that represents the average meaning of the text. This process can also be applied to vectorise videos and audio clips longer than what an embedding model can take as input or really any other type of embeddable data.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/OALM-Vectorisation-1.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><em>An illustration of the process of producing a mean embedding.</em></figcaption></figure><p>In splitting up our long-form data, however, it is essential that we do so in as meaningful a way as possible. Simply breaking up text at every 512th-token or, if we’re working with audiovisual data, 512th-second, could result in the loss of semantically important information. Imagine if we ended up splitting the sentence ‘I love to eat kangaroo gummies, they’re my favourite snack’ at the word ‘kangaroo’, resulting in the chunks ‘I love to eat kangaroo’ and ‘gummies, they’re my favourite snack’. The final embedding would no doubt be quite dissimilar from the text’s actual meaning.</p><p>Ideally, we’d like for our data to have already been divided into semantically meaningful sections that are all under our model’s context window. Realistically though, our data may not have any sections at all or, if it does have sections, not all may fit within the model’s context window. In such cases, we can first split our data into whatever parts we do have and then use a <em>semantic chunker</em> to bring whatever data is over the context window, under it.</p><p>For text data, I’d recommend <code><a href="https://github.com/umarbutler/semchunk">semchunk</a></code>, an extremely fast and lightweight Python library I developed to split millions of tokens worth of text into chunks as semantically meaningful as possible in a matter of seconds. It works by searching for sequences of characters known to indicate semantic breaks in text such as consecutive newlines and tabs, and then recursively splitting at those sequences until a text is under the given chunk size.</p><p>The code snippet below demonstrates exactly how you can use <code>semchunk</code> to split a dataset of documents into chunks with any given Hugging Face text embedding model of your choice. Just make sure you have <code><a href="https://github.com/umarbutler/semchunk">semchunk</a></code> and <code><a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transformers</a></code> installed beforehand.</p> <p>After chunking our data, we still need to vectorise it and then average those vectors such that<code> [1,</code> <code>2]</code> and <code>[3, 4]</code> becomes <code>[2, 3]</code> (not <code>[7]</code>). This is how’d you do that in practice, keeping in mind this code also requires <code><a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">torch</a></code> and <code><a href="https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tqdm</a></code>:</p> <h3>Dimensionality reduction</h3><p>Now that we’ve vectorised our data, the next step is to reduce its dimensionality. Dimensionality reduction is where you take a really long vector like <code>[4, 2, 1, 5, ..]</code> and turn it into lower-dimension coordinates like <code>[4, 2]</code>. This is how we map our data. It also makes our data easier to cluster later on, since high-dimensional data can often be quite tricky to cluster due to the ‘<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0019-x">curse of dimensionality</a>‘.</p><p>To reduce the data’s dimensionality, we use a <em>dimensionality reduction model</em>, a model capable of projecting high-dimensional data into low-dimensional spaces while preserving as much meaningful information as possible.</p><p>The model I used was <a href="https://github.com/YingfanWang/PaCMAP">PaCMAP</a>, which benchmarks as one of the fastest and most accurate dimensionality reduction models, capable of preserving both global and local structures in underlying datasets. The visualisation below, courtesy of their GitHub repository, shows what it looks like when you attempt to reduce a three-dimensional model of a mammoth down to two dimensions with PaCMAP (visible on the far right) and other popular dimensionality reduction models.</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="936" height="720" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PaCMAP-Mammoth.png" alt="" srcset="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PaCMAP-Mammoth.png 936w, https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PaCMAP-Mammoth-300x231.png 300w, https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PaCMAP-Mammoth-768x591.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PaCMAP-Mammoth.png"><figcaption><em>A visualisation of the reduction of a three-dimensional model of a mammoth down to two dimensions with the most popular dimensionality reduction models, courtesy of the Apache-2.0 licensed <a href="https://github.com/YingfanWang/PaCMAP">PaCMAP</a> GitHub repository.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Now, because we’re using PaCMAP for two different purposes, namely, to map the data and to make it easier to cluster, we can reduce our vectors to two different dimensions.</p><p>For mapping, two dimensions is what I went with but it’s also possible to visualise three.</p><p>For clustering, I choose 80 because my clusters seemed to benefit from high-dimensional data and 80 was the most dimensions I could use without slowing my PC down too much. What worked for me, however, may not work for you. With another dataset of ~400 data points, much lower than the Open Australian Legal Corpus’ 200k documents, I had found that 2 dimensions worked considerably better than 80. It is worth testing a range of dimensions to see what yields the best clusters for your data.</p><p>After installing the <code><a href="https://github.com/YingfanWang/PaCMAP">pacmap</a></code> Python package, you can use the following code to reduce the dimensionality of your data for both mapping and later clustering it:</p> <h3>Clustering</h3><p>Once the dimensionality of your data has been reduced, we can use a <em>clustering model</em> to group it into clusters of data points that are close together in our vector space. These clusters tend to correlate with the broad set of topics and themes present in a dataset.</p><p>There are a range of clustering models to choose from, each with their own unique advantages and drawbacks. I ended up settling on <a href="https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan">HDBSCAN</a>, which is generally <a href="https://pberba.github.io/stats/2020/07/08/intro-hdbscan/">well-regarded</a>. They have a <a href="https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/comparing_clustering_algorithms.html">page</a> in their documentation which covers their differences with other popular clustering methods. The most notable differentiator is that, unlike older algorithms such as <em>k</em>-means, HDBSCAN does not force every data point into a cluster, which is quite reasonable. There will always be data points that don’t quite fit into a known box. Forcing them into boxes just makes those boxes noisier.</p><p>The only problem with HDBSCAN is that it can sometimes be overzealous in refusing to cluster data points. In my case, there were 218,336 legal texts in the Open Australian Legal Corpus at the time that I produced the map and 84,780 (38.8%) could not be clustered. A further 10,100 (4.6%) were placed in clusters that did not appear to have any meaningful unifying features. In total, there were 94,880 (43.4%) documents that could not be assigned to a meaningful cluster and so were excluded from the map.</p><p>This is what the map would have looked like if I had included them.</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="2240" height="1260" src="https://umarbutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/unassigned.map_.oalm_.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><em>A version of the map with documents without meaningful clusters included.</em></figcaption></figure><p>It is clear that there were documents that HDBSCAN could and should have clustered, such as those part of the criminal and family law islands. This is likely the result of the curse of dimensionality but it may also be because I used <code><a href="https://github.com/TutteInstitute/fast_hdbscan">fast_hdbscan</a></code>, a faster implementation of HDBSCAN that I later discovered has a tendency to produce patchier clusters than regular HDBSCAN.</p><p>Accordingly, I’ll be using regular HDBSCAN in my code example.</p><p>You will notice that there are two hyperparameters that may be tuned, <code>min_cluster_size</code> and <code>min_samples</code>. Thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/5sfj0y/comment/ddfabms/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">this</a> Reddit comment and my own experimentation, I have found that <code>min_samples</code> should approach <code>log(n)</code> the noisier your dataset is, where <code>n</code> is the number of data points in the dataset. For clean data, it is appropriate to set <code>min_samples</code> to 1, which is what I used.</p><p><code>min_cluster_size</code> refers to the minimum number of data points that should be in a cluster. It is possible to yield meaningful clusters with both low and high minimum cluster sizes. It may be thought of as a control on how generalised clusters should be. For granular clusters reflecting specific topics in your data, a low minimum cluster size is preferable. For a couple broad clusters reflecting general themes in your data, a higher minimum cluster size is advised.</p><p>I ended up going with a cluster size of 50, which, in proportion to the size of my database, was minuscule. I only did this because I wanted to manually merge clusters myself in order to ensure that the final clusters were both as broad as I wanted them to be and were as precise as they could be. This resulted in 507 unique clusters (excluding the unassigned cluster), which I manually whittled down to 19 branches of law. I’ll get into how I pulled that off in the next section but for now, here is the code for how HDBSCAN can be used to cluster vectors:</p> <h3>Labelling</h3><p>After clustering your data, you’ll want to assign some meaningful labels to those clusters. This means figuring out exactly what it is that they share in common.</p><p>There are a number of techniques to choose from for identifying meaningful labels for clusters, including the use of tf-idf, generative AI-based labellers and of course hand labelling. I won’t get into all the options available, I’ll just cover what worked for me.</p><p>First, I identified the top tokens in each cluster by their tf-idf, which is a measure of a token’s frequency in a cluster weighted by its overall frequency in a dataset, such that tokens that are extremely common in only one cluster will have a higher tf-idf for that cluster than tokens that are extremely common in all clusters. This served as an easy way to quickly associate clusters with labels reflecting their unique composition.</p><p>With the top tokens by tf-idf in hand, I merged any clusters whose top four tokens were the same, which got rid of just 2 of the 507 clusters. Next, I manually reviewed the clusters in order to produce a set of 337 rules on how to merge them based on their top tokens.</p><p>In manually merging clusters, I tried my best to be as agnostic as possible on what the final set of categories should look like. The idea was to let the data guide me, rather than me guiding the data. As the number of clusters began to dwindle, however, I soon found myself forced to make increasingly difficult decisions about what categories to include and exclude, such as whether it would better to roll up health and social services law into a single area of law rather than creating a commercial law category out of tax, finance and insolvency law. I originally wanted to include many more areas of law than the 19 branches you see on the map now, but I was ultimately constrained by the fact that even visualising 19 easily distinguishable categories on a map with contiguous continents is no small feat (it was only thanks to a colour <a href="https://sashamaps.net/docs/resources/20-colors/">palette</a> published by fellow data scientist Sasha Trubetskoy that I managed to pull it off!).</p><p>Eventually, I ended up settling on a set of clusters that I felt were a reasonable way of dividing up my map, although I recognise it may not necessarily be the most optimal way, if such an optimum even exists.</p><p>This merging process was one of the most difficult components of building the map, second only to writing this article, but it also taught me a lot not only about the broad makeup of Australian law but also about the many different ways law in general can be sliced up.</p><p>I would only recommend manually merging clusters if you also want to develop an intimate understanding of the composition of your data or if it is particularly important to you that the final product be as precise and accurate as possible. Otherwise, it would be much more beneficial to tune your clustering model to produce a more manageable amount of clusters. You can then automatically label those clusters by either taking their top three tokens by tf-idf as their label or using a large language model to generate more coherent labels from those tokens.</p><p>In the code snippet below, I show how you can identify the top tokens in a cluster by tf-idf. Please note that the code relies on <code><a href="https://www.nltk.org/">nltk</a></code>.</p> <p>If you wanted to take your automated labelling a step further, you could also use the following code to get GPT-4 (or another OpenAI API-compatible model) to generate labels for you, keeping in mind that this code requires the <code><a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-python">openai</a></code> and <code><a href="https://github.com/umarbutler/semchunk">semchunk</a></code> Python libraries.</p> <h3>Visualisation</h3><p>At this point, the only piece of the puzzle left is to visualise your map. There are a number of Python libraries capable of producing two- and three-dimensional scatter plots, but none of them are particularly impressive, including the library I eventually settled on, which was <a href="https://plotly.com/">Plotly</a>.</p><p>My main grievance with Plotly is that it does not let you expand the size of data points when zooming into a map. This really becomes an issue where you have hundreds of thousands of data points and you find that they either overlap with each other or, if you reduce their size, they become almost impossible to identify when zoomed in. There is a 3-year-old <a href="http://GitHub issue">GitHub issue</a> concerning this problem but it doesn’t look like it will get solved anytime soon.</p><p>There were other less severe issues I experienced with Plotly that I was able to work around with custom CSS and Javascript. I won’t provide that code at the moment as it is not particularly pretty, but I will share a code snippet illustrating how Plotly can be used to visualise mapped data:</p> <p>With that done, you should now have your very semantic map. The next step is to analyse it. Look for patterns in the map’s geography, inspect outliers, search for islands, get a sense of the underlying structure of your data.</p><p>As my own analysis has shown, there is a lot you can learn just by mapping a dataset. And, once you get the ball rolling, it can quickly spiral into an addition. I have hundreds of ideas for how to expand my map to uncover new relationships. The real power of semantic mapping comes out when you apply it against very large datasets. Imagine applying these techniques on the <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a> corpus, for example. You would be able to produce a first-of-its-kind high-resolution map of the internet.</p><p>If you do end up publishing your own semantic map, be sure to cite this article to enable others to learn about the power of semantic mapping.</p><p>Otherwise, happy mapping!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>One user, who goes by Monica, wrote in a post on her personal blog that Glassdoor added her name and the city where she lives to her Glassdoor profile following an email exchange with Glassdoor customer support, despite having never provided her name during the sign-up process some years earlier. Monica, whose last name we’re not publishing to protect her privacy, accused Glassdoor of getting her full name from the email she sent to customer support, which she says they added to her Glassdoor profile.</p>
<p>“My email ‘from’ line contains my full name — never thought that would be a problem!” Monica told TechCrunch in an email. “They then added my name to my Glassdoor profile.”</p>
<p>Monica repeatedly protested Glassdoor, telling customer support that the company did not have her consent or permission to do this. But Glassdoor said Monica was “required” to have her name added to her profile, adding that this would not compromise her anonymity of past reviews she gave. Monica said that her anonymity might not last if Glassdoor was to experience a hack or a data breach and compromise users’ data. It also means this information can be obtained by legal process, such as a lawsuit or police demanding access to Glassdoor user data.</p>
<p>As Monica explained, Glassdoor will add a user’s real name (and potentially other information) to the user’s account without their permission if Glassdoor learns it.</p>
<p>And the only other option is to delete your account, Monica said.</p>
<p>Glassdoor users expressed alarm at Monica’s story, which has been widely shared on social media and news-sharing sites, for fear that their anonymity could be compromised by having data collected about them and added to their profiles, as well.</p>

<p>Glassdoor has long allowed users to sign up anonymously. In 2021, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/glassdoor-fishbowl-linkedin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glassdoor bought Fishbowl</a>, a semi-anonymous professional social network site that allows users to “ask questions without disclosing your name.” Ars Technica, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/glassdoor-adding-users-real-names-job-info-to-profiles-without-consent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first reported</a> Monica’s story, explained that Fishbowl requires users to verify their identities before using the site. As part of the acquisition deal, Glassdoor signed every user up for a Fishbowl account, meaning Glassdoor would have to change its terms of service so that every Glassdoor user could also be verified.</p>
<p>Aaron Mackey, an attorney with the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation, told TechCrunch that Glassdoor has been an “industry leader” in defending its users’ anonymity. Mackey previously defended an anonymous Glassdoor user in court whose employer <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-fights-protect-anonymity-glassdoor-commenter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried to unmask and identify their identity</a>.</p>
<p>“We hope that Glassdoor will continue to defend its users’ anonymity in court,” said Mackey. “But the latest news regarding Glassdoor’s policies raises concerns about whether users may be identified even if their information is never sought by an employer or law enforcement. Those policies also appear to conflict with, or at least be in tension with, Glassdoor’s goal of encouraging employees to candidly review their employers.”</p>
<p>In some cases, the data added to the user’s profile did not completely line up.</p>
<p>Josh Simmons said Glassdoor added information about him to his profile without his consent, describing it as a “breach of trust.” Simmons told TechCrunch that he did not know how Glassdoor got his personal data.</p>
<p>“It’s not clear to me how they got this information,” Simmons told TechCrunch. “I didn’t have any social accounts connected to Glassdoor, and I hadn’t used the service in several years,” suggesting that the data may have been scraped or come from a data broker.</p>
<p>Simmons said his supplemented Glassdoor profile had an “incoherent mix of details, but each detail was correct in isolation,” describing how Glassdoor got the name of his consultancy correct but jumbled his location in California with his main client based in London.</p>
<p>“Taken together, it signaled to me that it was the result of an automated process,” Simmons said.</p>
<p>By Glassdoor’s own admission, the company <a href="https://help.glassdoor.com/s/article/Does-Glassdoor-verify-employees?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says on its website</a> that it is “unable to fully confirm our users’ identities, the truthfulness of their contributions, or their employment status.” It’s not clear what the goal of Glassdoor’s data collection is if the information is not accurate.</p>
<p>When reached for comment, Glassdoor spokesperson Amanda Livingood would not answer TechCrunch’s specific questions, including how — if at all — Glassdoor verifies the accuracy of the information it receives, or how it can be used or obtained. Glassdoor does not publish a transparency report detailing the number of requests for user data it receives from law enforcement.</p>
<p>Instead, the company provided a boilerplate statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Glassdoor is committed to providing a platform for people to share their opinions and experiences about their jobs and companies, anonymously – without fear of intimidation or retaliation. User reviews on Glassdoor have always and will always be anonymous. In the Glassdoor community, users always have the choice to post with their name or post anonymously with their company name or job title. Glassdoor has never and will never reveal a user’s name alongside their content, unless that is what the user chooses.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mackey said that the risk of data breaches or legal demands are magnified because Glassdoor is now collecting more information about users that could identify them. “But because Glassdoor now collects that information, including from email addresses and headers, Glassdoor now has data that directly identifies their users,” Mackey said.</p>
<p>That leaves users like Monica with no choice but to delete their account if they are not willing to have their name on their profile. And so Monica did.</p>
<p><em>According to Monica, closing your account just deactivates it. If you want to fully delete your Glassdoor account, you can head over to <strong><a href="https://help.glassdoor.com/s/privacyrequest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this specific Glassdoor privacy request page</a></strong> and fill out the data request form with the appropriate selection, such as “Delete my personal data.”</em></p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We introduce Chronos, a simple yet effective framework for pretrained probabilistic time series models. Chronos tokenizes time series values using scaling and quantization into a fixed vocabulary and trains existing transformer-based language model architectures on these tokenized time series via the cross-entropy loss. We pretrained Chronos models based on the T5 family (ranging from 20M to 710M parameters) on a large collection of publicly available datasets, complemented by a synthetic dataset that we generated via Gaussian processes to improve generalization. In a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 42 datasets, and comprising both classical local models and deep learning methods, we show that Chronos models: (a) significantly outperform other methods on datasets that were part of the training corpus; and (b) have comparable and occasionally superior zero-shot performance on new datasets, relative to methods that were trained specifically on them. Our results demonstrate that Chronos models can leverage time series data from diverse domains to improve zero-shot accuracy on unseen forecasting tasks, positioning pretrained models as a viable tool to greatly simplify forecasting pipelines.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Your grade school teacher probably didn’t show you how to add 20-digit numbers. But if you know how to add smaller numbers, all you need is paper and pencil and a bit of patience. Start with the ones place and work leftward step by step, and soon you’ll be stacking up quintillions with ease.</p>
<p>Problems like this are easy for humans, but only if we approach them in the right way. “How we humans solve these problems is not ‘stare at it and then write down the answer,’” said <a href="https://www.eranmalach.com/">Eran Malach</a>, a machine learning researcher at Harvard University. “We actually walk through the steps.”</p>
<p>That insight has inspired researchers studying the large language models that power chatbots like ChatGPT. While these systems might ace questions involving a few steps of arithmetic, they’ll often flub problems involving many steps, like calculating the sum of two large numbers. But in 2022, a team of Google researchers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903">showed</a> that asking language models to generate step-by-step solutions enabled the models to solve problems that had previously seemed beyond their reach. Their technique, called chain-of-thought prompting, soon became widespread, even as researchers struggled to understand what makes it work.</p>
<p>Now, several teams have explored the power of chain-of-thought reasoning by using techniques from an arcane branch of theoretical computer science called computational complexity theory. It’s the latest chapter in a line of research that uses complexity theory to study the intrinsic capabilities and limitations of language models. These efforts clarify where we should expect models to fail, and they might point toward new approaches to building them.</p>
<p>“They remove some of the magic,” said <a href="https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ece/Faculty/Papailiopoulos_Dimitris/">Dimitris Papailiopoulos</a>, a machine learning researcher at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. “That’s a good thing.”</p>
<h2><strong>Training Transformers</strong></h2>
<p>Large language models are built around mathematical structures called artificial neural networks. The many “neurons” inside these networks perform simple mathematical operations on long strings of numbers representing individual words, transmuting each word that passes through the network into another. The details of this mathematical alchemy depend on another set of numbers called the network’s parameters, which quantify the strength of the connections between neurons.</p>

<p>To train a language model to produce coherent outputs, researchers typically start with a neural network whose parameters all have random values, and then feed it reams of data from around the internet. Each time the model sees a new block of text, it tries to predict each word in turn: It guesses the second word based on the first, the third based on the first two, and so on. It compares each prediction to the actual text, then tweaks its parameters to reduce the difference. Each tweak only changes the model’s predictions a tiny bit, but somehow their collective effect enables a model to respond coherently to inputs it has never seen.</p>
<p>Researchers have been training neural networks to process language for 20 years. But the work really took off in 2017, when researchers at Google introduced a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">new kind of network</a> called a transformer.</p>
<p>“This was proposed seven years ago, which seems like prehistory,” said <a href="https://pbarcelo.ing.uc.cl/">Pablo Barceló</a>, a machine learning researcher at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.</p>
<p>What made transformers so transformative is that it’s easy to scale them up — to increase the number of parameters and the amount of training data — without making training prohibitively expensive. Before transformers, neural networks had at most a few hundred million parameters; today, the largest transformer-based models have more than a trillion. Much of the improvement in language-model performance over the past five years comes from simply scaling up.</p>
<p>Transformers made this possible by using special mathematical structures called attention heads, which give them a sort of bird’s-eye view of the text they’re reading. When a transformer reads a new block of text, its attention heads quickly scan the whole thing and identify relevant connections between words — perhaps noting that the fourth and eighth words are likely to be most useful for predicting the 10th. Then the attention heads pass words along to an enormous web of neurons called a feedforward network, which does the heavy number crunching needed to generate the predictions that help it learn.</p>
<p>Real transformers have multiple layers of attention heads separated by feedforward networks, and only spit out predictions after the last layer. But at each layer, the attention heads have already identified the most relevant context for each word, so the computationally intensive feedforward step can happen simultaneously for every word in the text. That speeds up the training process, making it possible to train transformers on increasingly large sets of data. Even more important, it allows researchers to spread the enormous computational load of training a massive neural network across many processors working in tandem.</p>
<p>To get the most out of massive data sets, “you have to make the models really large,” said <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~dchiang/">David Chiang</a>, a machine learning researcher at the University of Notre Dame. “It’s just not going to be practical to train them unless it’s parallelized.”</p>

<p>However, the parallel structure that makes it so easy to train transformers doesn’t help after training — at that point, there’s no need to predict words that already exist. During ordinary operation, transformers output one word at a time, tacking each output back onto the input before generating the next word, but they’re still stuck with an architecture optimized for parallel processing.</p>
<p>As transformer-based models grew and certain tasks continued to give them trouble, some researchers began to wonder whether the push toward more parallelizable models had come at a cost. Was there a way to understand the behavior of transformers theoretically?</p>
<h2><strong>The Complexity of Transformers</strong></h2>
<p>Theoretical studies of neural networks face many difficulties, especially when they try to account for training. Neural networks use a well-known procedure to tweak their parameters at each step of the training process. But it can be difficult to understand why this simple procedure converges on a good set of parameters.</p>
<p>Rather than consider what happens during training, some researchers study the intrinsic capabilities of transformers by imagining that it’s possible to adjust their parameters to any arbitrary values. This amounts to treating a transformer as a special type of programmable computer.</p>
<p>“You’ve got some computing device, and you want to know, ‘Well, what can it do? What kinds of functions can it compute?’” Chiang said.</p>
<p>These are the central questions in the formal study of computation. The field dates back to 1936, when Alan Turing first imagined a <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/alan-turings-most-important-machine-was-never-built-20230503/">fanciful device</a>, now called a Turing machine, that could perform any computation by reading and writing symbols on an infinite tape. Computational complexity theorists would later build on Turing’s work by proving that computational problems naturally fall into different <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-short-guide-to-hard-problems-20180716/">complexity classes</a> defined by the resources required to solve them.</p>
<p>In 2019, Barceló and two other researchers <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03429">proved</a> that an idealized version of a transformer with a fixed number of parameters could be just as powerful as a Turing machine. If you set up a transformer to repeatedly feed its output back in as an input and set the parameters to the appropriate values for the specific problem you want to solve, it will eventually spit out the correct answer.</p>
<p>That result was a starting point, but it relied on some unrealistic assumptions that would likely overestimate the power of transformers. In the years since, researchers have worked to develop more realistic theoretical frameworks.</p>
<p>One such effort began in 2021, when <a href="https://lambdaviking.com/">William Merrill</a>, now a graduate student at New York University, was leaving a two-year fellowship at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle. While there, he’d analyzed other kinds of neural networks using techniques that seemed like a poor fit for transformers’ parallel architecture. Shortly before leaving, he struck up a conversation with the Allen Institute for AI researcher <a href="https://allenai.org/team/ashishs">Ashish Sabharwal</a>, who’d studied complexity theory before moving into AI research. They began to suspect that complexity theory might help them understand the limits of transformers.</p>

<p>“It just seemed like it’s a simple model; there must be some limitations that one can just nail down,” Sabharwal said.</p>
<p>The pair analyzed transformers using a branch of computational complexity theory, called circuit complexity, that is often used to study parallel computation and had <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06618">recently been applied</a> to simplified versions of transformers. Over the following year, they refined several of the unrealistic assumptions in previous work. To study how the parallel structure of transformers might limit their capabilities, the pair considered the case where transformers didn’t feed their output back into their input — instead, their first output would have to be the final answer. They <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00729">proved</a> that the transformers in this theoretical framework couldn’t solve any computational problems that lie outside a specific complexity class. And many math problems, including relatively simple ones like solving linear equations, are thought to lie outside this class.</p>
<p>Basically, they showed that parallelism did come at a cost — at least when transformers had to spit out an answer right away. “Transformers are quite weak if the way you use them is you give an input, and you just expect an immediate answer,” Merrill said.</p>
<h2><strong>Thought Experiments</strong></h2>
<p>Merrill and Sabharwal’s results raised a natural question — how much more powerful do transformers become when they’re allowed to recycle their outputs? Barceló and his co-authors had studied this case in their 2019 analysis of idealized transformers, but with more realistic assumptions the question remained open. And in the intervening years, researchers had discovered chain-of-thought prompting, giving the question a newfound relevance.</p>
<p>Merrill and Sabharwal knew that their purely mathematical approach couldn’t capture all aspects of chain-of-thought reasoning in real language models, where the wording in the prompt <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10001">can be very important</a>. But no matter how a prompt is phrased, as long as it causes a language model to output step-by-step solutions, the model can in principle reuse the results of intermediate steps on subsequent passes through the transformer. That could provide a way to evade the limits of parallel computation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a team from Peking University had been thinking along similar lines, and their preliminary results were positive. In a May 2023 paper, they identified some math problems that should be impossible for ordinary transformers in Merrill and Sabharwal’s framework, and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15408">showed</a> that intermediate steps enabled the transformers to solve these problems.</p>
<p>In October, Merrill and Sabharwal followed up their earlier work with a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07923">detailed theoretical study</a> of the computational power of chain of thought. They quantified how that extra computational power depends on the number of intermediate steps a transformer is allowed to use before it must spit out a final answer. In general, researchers expect the appropriate number of intermediate steps for solving any problem to depend on the size of the input to the problem. For example, the simplest strategy for adding two 20-digit numbers requires twice as many intermediate addition steps as the same approach to adding two 10-digit numbers.</p>
<p>Examples like this suggest that transformers wouldn’t gain much from using just a few intermediate steps. Indeed, Merrill and Sabharwal proved that chain of thought only really begins to help when the number of intermediate steps grows in proportion to the size of the input, and many problems require the number of intermediate steps to grow much larger still.</p>
<p>The thoroughness of the result impressed researchers. “They really pinned this down,” said <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~djhsu/">Daniel Hsu</a>, a machine learning researcher at Columbia University.</p>
<p>Merrill and Sabharwal’s recent work indicates that chain of thought isn’t a panacea — in principle, it can help transformers solve harder problems, but only at the cost of a lot of computational effort.</p>
<p>“We’re interested in different ways of getting around the limitations of transformers with one step,” Merrill said. “Chain of thought is one way, but this paper shows that it might not be the most economical way.”</p>
<h2><strong>Back to Reality </strong></h2>
<p>Still, researchers caution that this sort of theoretical analysis can only reveal so much about real language models. Positive results — proofs that transformers can in principle solve certain problems — don’t imply that a language model will actually learn those solutions during training.</p>

<p>And even results that address the limitations of transformers come with caveats: They indicate that no transformer can solve certain problems perfectly in all cases. Of course, that’s a pretty high bar. “There might be special cases of the problem that it could handle just fine,” Hsu said.</p>
<p>Despite these caveats, the new work offers a template for analyzing different kinds of neural network architectures that might eventually replace transformers. If a complexity theory analysis suggests that certain types of networks are more powerful than others, that would be evidence that those networks might fare better in the real world as well.</p>
<p>Chiang also stressed that research on the limitations of transformers is all the more valuable as language models are increasingly used in a wide range of real-world applications, making it easy to overestimate their abilities.</p>
<p>“There’s actually a lot of things that they don’t do that well, and we need to be very, very cognizant of what the limitations are,” Chiang said. “That’s why this kind of work is really important.”</p>

<p>Glassdoor users have been reporting lately that the platform has introduced changes in its privacy policy, which include publishing people’s real names and locations on their profiles without securing consent.</p>



<p>Glassdoor is a website where current and former employees can anonymously submit reviews about their experiences working for a company, including details such as their employer’s culture, management practices, salaries, work-life balance, and more. Job seekers can read those reviews to help them make job-related decisions, and employees can use anonymous feedback to improve on key areas.</p>



<p>While Glassdoor is built on the principle of transparency, it wouldn’t work without securing anonymity for reviewers, as exposing internal practices could put reviewers in legal trouble, blacklisting, firing, and other forms of retaliation. Yet, this is precisely what is happening to the platform right now, according to some user reports.</p>



<p>A Glassdoor account holder named ‘Monica’ posted about her recent experience explaining that she created an account about ten years ago when the platform only required an email address. She specifically chose not to link her Glassdoor account with Facebook or Google.</p>



<p>After responding to a support email from Glassdoor, Monica noticed that her profile had been updated to include her real name and location without the platform asking for her consent.</p>



<p>This discovery led to a series of email exchanges with Glassdoor’s support team, during which the author was informed of a new policy requiring all users to verify their identity for full platform access. The support agents explain that this was happening in the context of a transition to a “verified network,” including the introduction of ‘Fishbowl’ accounts linked to Glassdoor profiles.</p>



<p>Fishbowl is a semi-anonymous social networking platform designed for professionals to connect, share insights, and engage in discussions. The platform was bought by Glassdoor in 2021, and its engineers are working on introducing some level of integration that would offer users a combination of Glassdoor’s insights and Fishbowl’s networking opportunities.</p>



<p>Monica strongly objected to the whole idea, citing privacy concerns and the potential risks of such information being exposed, especially in relation to their employment and the security of their data online. Glassdoor’s support agents didn’t yield and insisted that real names cannot be removed, so the only option for Monica would be to delete the account entirely.</p>



<p>Monica concludes by advising all Glassdoor users to delete their accounts. According to the <a href="https://help.glassdoor.com/s/privacyrequest?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platform’s privacy policy</a>, deletion merely deactivates the account, and to completely erase personal data, one must specifically request the deletion of their personal data through a form provided at the bottom of Glassdoor’s data policy page.</p>



<p>A report that appeared in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/20/glassdoor-added-real-names-profiles-without-consent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TechCrunch</a> yesterday attempts to fill in some of the gaps left in <a href="https://cellio.dreamwidth.org/2024/03/12/glassdoor-violates-privacy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monica’s blog post</a>, such as how exactly Glassdoor got to know the user’s name without them giving it. Another Glassdoor user, Josh Simmons, who also got his name exposed on his public profile without previously sharing it with the platform, speculates that the info was either scraped or acquired from a data broker, both very shady scenarios. </p>





<p>Aaron Mackey from the Electronic Frontier Foundation highlighted Glassdoor’s previous unwavering stance in protecting its users’ anonymity in courts and called the recent developments highly concerning.</p>



<p>RestorePrivacy has contacted Glassdoor for a comment on the allegations and clarifications on its policies on user anonymity, and we will update this post as soon as we hear back.</p>



<p>In the meantime, if you have a Glassdoor account and have posted anything in the past, make sure to log in and check the information included on your public profile to avoid damaging exposure.</p>

<p>Here is an introduction and survey of Algorithmic Mathematical Art.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, they were merely visualization aids in the study of mathematics. Gradually, the complexity and artistry of the images becomes an end itself.</p>

<p>Here, i examine the various methods of algorithmic mathematical art, and indicate the states of the art and possibilities. At the end, i give a definition of Algorithmic Mathematical Art.</p>

<h2>Geometric Surfaces</h2>

<p>Plots of arbitrary 3D surfaces for visual arts purposes has not been explored much. The exception is visualization of some special mathematical surfaces, especially in differential geometry. (for example:
minimal surfaces at <a href="http://virtualmathmuseum.org/Surface/gallery_m.html" data-accessed="2017-11-24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://virtualmathmuseum.org/Surface/gallery_m.html</a>
.)</p>

<p>As of today, it is scarcely known how surfaces look like of arbitrary equations of 3 variables. Equations with more than 3 variables can be projected or sliced to 3 dimensional space, and this is completely unexplored.</p>

<h2>Regular Solids of 3 or more dimensions</h2>

<p>In 2 dimensions we have regular polygons, such as square and pentagon and hexagon. The 3-dimensional version is called regular polyhedron. For example: cube, octahedron, icosahedron. The general name for such objects in any dimension is called polytope.</p>

<p>Polyhedrons
as artistic themes have been explored greatly, way back in the Greek times and in different cultures, often exhibited as toys, sculptures, paper models (origami), or hanging decoration. In modern times, polyhedrons have been exhibited as architecture element as well. (Examples: the

<p>Computer models as visual arts have been very popular. However, most of them are direct rendering of the mathematical object with almost no artistic value. Commonly seen are polyhedrons rendered with latest ray-tracing computer graphics advances, with some stellation or truncation. Highly artist algorithmic exploration of polytopes is almost non-existent. The image by Michael Trott above, of a dodecahedron rendered as linked pentagonal rings, is a basic artistic exploration.</p>

<p>For some examples of artistic algorithmic exploration, one can
systematically examine ways to render a space by linked rings.
For the centrally symmetric dodacahedron, for example, by some cleverness in linking, the links can extend to infinity as to fill the whole space with these links, and a cut-away view can be made to result in a artistic image. Or, polygonal tubes can be made to have larger radius, so that each polygonal “side” of the tube is a large flat area that a
Maze
can be incribed upon.
The number of sides of the ring can increase or decrease
according to certain parameters, such as symmetry location or distance
from origin. Or, one can use spheres instead of rings. The coloring of
balls around the dodecahedron can be exploited systematically, so to
result in different symmetry groups of different groups of
balls. Imagine a 3-D space with a cluster of differently colored balls
that exhibits subtly different symmetry groups as in an elaborate
intricate tiling work. Or, imagine 3-D space tiled uniformly by
regular polyhedrons, with some walls open, as to form a 3-dimensional
maze. If well done, a cut-away view or translucent view of this would be fantastic. A
walk-thru as implemented in video games also has great
potential. Solid stacks of cubes is called
Polycube
(a 3-dimensional version of
polymino). Solid block sculptures with other
regular polyhedron are basically unexplored. Block of
connected tetrahedron are particularly interesting.</p>

<p>Traditional artworks based on geometric process include that of circles of tangency (
Appollonius circles
), various plane transformations applied to a grid or regular tilings (linear, affine, projective, geometric inversion, mobiüs transformation, stereographic projection…). A particular example in recreation is
anamorphosis,
which is a drawing that is not recognizable until its reflection is viewed on a shiny cylinder or metal ball. (See: <a href="http://xahlee.org/xa/va/gcan.html">artwork “Trash Reflection”</a>)</p>

L-System
is a recursive symbol-sequence replacement system originally devised to model plant growth. It is often used to generate self-similar images by interpreting the symbol-sequence as drawing commands or geometric objects. Turtle Graphics is from the programing language
Logo, which algorithmically controls the movement of a pen, by specifying directions and pen down or up.
</p>

<p>L-System and Turtle Graphics have been somewhat popular among recreational programers. However, there have not been serious studies of visual art possibilities with these methods. Commonly found are illustration of famous
plane-filling curves
in mathematics, plant-growth modeling, or simplistic symmetric drawings for children as a demo of Logo. Few of them are ingenious.</p>

<h2>Plotting of Functions and Processes</h2>

<p>Many functions in mathematics can be visualized as a plot. For curves and surfaces, the plotting scheme is simple.
Often just on a 2D grid or 3D grid, with marked axes as coordinate. For other functions, such as vector valued functions, complex valued functions, mathematicians have developed other schemes to visualize these functions. Here are some examples.</p>

<p>The main attraction of
Celtic knot
patterns is their geometric design, but the topological aspect (the “knot”) is also interesting mathematically. One can survey traditional designs to see whether they are really knots, or braids of how many strands, and how they are knotted. I'm not sure this has been studied much. There is little systematic study of algorithmic knot/weaving-pattern generations. (There have been systematic mathematical studies of weavings/fabrics by B Grünbaum and G C Shephard).</p>

<p>There are many varieties of pattern designs by different cultures. The decorative Celtic knots and Islamic geometric tilings are particularly mathematical. Although there are great number of existing designs throughout the world and history, but with respect to mathematical or algorithmic classifications, there are not many varieties. This is not surprising when we consider that these artistic patterns are developed culturally by artisans, not as a result of mathematical analysis of plane symmetry or systematic algorithmic exploration.</p>

<p>For plane patterns, it is known since the last century that there are 17 types of symmetries. According to Branko Grünbaum et al [Symmetry in Moorish and Other Ornaments, Comp. and Maths. with appls., Vol. 12B, Nos. 3/4. pp. 641-653, 1986], not all types are found in Alhambra, contrary to popular belief. The mathematical understanding of tilings and patterns is relatively poor even today. It is essentially a unexplored area. The mathematical analysis of weavings is almost completely untouched. (Weaving, as the mathematical content of Celtic knots and Islamic patterns. It can be considered topologically as knots and braids, or as certain uniform lattice network with marked nodes and edges with a geometric layout.)</p>

<p>Penrose tiling is a aperiodic tiling. The discovery of Penrose tiling was a break-thru in mathematics and crystallography with great ramifications (For example, material science). The beauty of aperiodic tilings is that their orderliness is subtle. Such type of beauty was not possible in the past.</p>

<p>Fractals are plots of mathematical objects. They began as a visual aid of a mathematical process. Essentially, each point in the plane is colored according to how that value (x,y) behaves when fed into a formula recursively.</p>

<p>Fractals, by its very nature of garishness and bizarreness, has been extremely popular among computer artists — even those who are not interested in mathematics or computer science. Fractals as a visual art have been explored extensively, and great many varieties and galleries have been created on the web.</p>

<p>The exploration of fractals as a visual art form has somewhat limited expression. Artistic creativity is limited to concocting equations and coloring schemes. Some people have started to mix computer generated fractals with manual manipulations, such as mixing in digitally modified photos. Such artwork ceases being algorithmic or mathematical.</p>

<h2>Higher Dimensions</h2>

<p>As we understand higher dimensional spaces, it opens a great gate of algorithmic art thru the process of projection or slicing of higher dimensional objects to 3-dimensional space or the plane.</p>

<p>Non-Euclidean geometry and higher dimensional geometry and topology are understood by only a few mathematicians in the world. (perhaps a few thousand people, or less if we are specific in the field) Consequently, artistic exploits thru their understanding are basically non-existent. Almost all ideas discussed in this page can be thought about in higher dimensions and or non-Euclidean space. In higher dimensions, there are totally new concepts that are non-existent in lower dimensions. (orientability, embedding, isotropism, etc) As math and technology march on, we may see more visual art explorations thru higher dimensions.</p>

<p>As a example, one idea of creating tilings and patterns is to slice thru some regular lattices of some higher-dimensional manifold. And, we may ask whether it is possible to encode some higher-dimensional manifold properties (such as orientability or the geometry it admits) by a visual exhibition. (i do not quite understand this, but for example, we can illustrate the angle-invariant property of
<a href="http://xahlee.info/SpecialPlaneCurves_dir/Inversion_dir/inversion.html">inversion</a> by showing the
<a href="http://xahlee.info/complex/inv/pre1.png">before</a>

<a href="http://xahlee.info/complex/inv/post1.png">after</a>
images of a rectangular grid. We can also show linear and affine transformations by the way they look when applied to a grid. We can show properties of projective transformation and

homeomorphism or continuous transformation by animation, especially on tilings. We can color surfaces by their curvature, and draw gridlines along constant curvature lines, and show invariance of curvature such as the

<h2>Evolutionary Programing</h2>

<p>Evolutionary programing
is a emerging method to generate visual art. The method is often done as genetic programing with human arbiter for judging the survival of the fittest. However, most of the investigations done so far over the 1990s tend to be insults to eye with the excuse of being abstract “art”. They are not mathematical.</p>

<p>Cellular Automata
(CA) methods can also be employed for mathematical visual art. Stephen Wolfram's book
A New Kind of Science,
for example, contains many pleasing images of cellular automata, although not for the express purpose of visual art. For example, it is frequently cited that the patterns on sea shells are results of cellular automata.
(<a href="http://xahlee.org/xa/xamsi_calku/ca/DSCN0185m.jpg">seashell photo</a>)
This is a example of using CA for non-mathematical art. (That is, the image does not contain some inherent math structure or appeal.). However, CA probably can be exploited for mathematical art. For example, consider the great varieties of seashell shapes.
(See: <a href="http://xahlee.info/SpecialPlaneCurves_dir/Seashell_dir/index.html">Math of Seashell Shapes</a>)
Some has horns, spikes, ribs. Some are long, some are flat, and there are many types of overall spiraling structure. Seashells are grown from the calcium deposits secreted by the mollusks, and over the years many different shapes emerged thru evolution. Therefore, it is conceivable that a 3-D cellular automata can be set up with genetic programing to simulate the evolutionary process, as to obtain the many shapes of seashells as pure art of mathematical spiraling surfaces.

<h2>M C Escher</h2>

<p>M C Escher (1898 to 1972) is a Dutch artist whose works are predominated by mathematical themes, many of which are purely algorithmic. Although, Escher is a traditional artist; his algorithmic arts are done manually, not by a program from computer, nor with a explicit algorithmic specification.</p>

<p>It is easy to go from algorithms to visual images, but given a algorithmic artwork, it is difficult to extract the algorithm in the form of a precise runnable program. The following two works by M C Escher illustrates this:</p>

<figcaption>
<cite>butterfly</cite>
, by M C Escher. This image is clearly purely algorithmic. However, it is not trivial to extract the algorithm involved and turn it into a working program. From a pure minimalist point of view, one should be able to start with half a image of a butterfly, and apply a algorithm recursively to get the final image. Note that the butterfly's wings are colored in such a way that mutually orthogonal circles are formed, and this must be encoded in some way into the algorithm. There are different algorithmic approaches. One can do it by describing pen paths as in Turtle Graphics, or by recursive replacement as in L-Systems. Perhaps a least interesting way is by a mapping process with some mathematical model such as hyperbolic geometry on a rotational-symmetric tiling. Once a algorithm is obtained, one should be able to apply it to various motifs, or tweak parameters to get different effects.

<cite>Whirlpools</cite>
, by M C Escher. This image is also clearly algorithmic. It consists of a strip of a repeated motif (the fish), wrapped into a double spiral. To generate this image algorithmically, one can start with a motif, reflect and glide-reflect to get a long strip, then use a function that map the strip into a spiral, then mirror to get the other spiral. (or use a function that maps a strip into such double-spirals) Finding the function may not be easy. I imagine to get it right it might take several days tweaking it with functional programing languages such as Mathematica, Lisp, Haskell. Perhaps a more elegant but even more difficult approach is to describe it recursively, which would also deal better with singularities at the center of each spiral.

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To generate this work algorithmically, one needs to encode the knot process. (i.e. when there is a intersection between 2 circles, which one goes on top.). One also needs to encode the geometric layout, namely, the circle's positions and sizes. Note that circles are smallers near the center, but also gets smaller near the edge. This size change is not linear. Also, note that the circles have 3 different colors. The coloring basically cycle thru as they are spread toward the edge. Also, each of the circle ring has a slant (a thin side), either facing the center or facing the edge.</p>

<h2>What is Algorithmic Mathematical Art</h2>

<p>A visual artwork is <b>mathematical</b> if it appeals to mathematicians and the graphics itself encodes a mathematical structure. For example, M C Escher's tiling works are mathematical art, but some of his other works such as

<i>
<a href="http://xahlee.info/math/algorithmic_math_art/escher/Moebius_Band_II.jpg">Ants Crawling On A Mobius Strip</a>,
Illusions,

Forever Loop Stairs</i>, are works of art illustrating
mathematical ideas, but not the mathematical art discussed here.</p>

<p>A visual artwork is <b>algorithmic</b> if it is recursive, symmetric, or embodies a mathematical equation (such as
<a href="http://xahlee.info/SpecialPlaneCurves_dir/specialPlaneCurves.html">curves</a> and
<a href="http://xahlee.info/surface/gallery.html">surfaces</a>). For example, M C Escher's “<a href="http://xahlee.info/math/algorithmic_math_art/escher/escher79butterfly.jpg">Butterfly</a>” and “<a href="http://xahlee.info/math/algorithmic_math_art/escher/whirlpools.jpg">Whirlpools</a>” and his tiling works are algorithmic. All illustrations in this article are algorithmic. Algorithmic art exhibits recursion or symmetry (including quasi-symmetric ones like that of
<a href="http://xahlee.info/math/algorithmic_math_art/penrose2.png">Penrose Tiling</a>
). However, artwork generated by computer programs are not necessarily algorithmic. For example,
<a href="http://xahlee.info/math/algorithmic_math_art/Glasses_pov.png">ray-traced computer generated sceneries</a>,
or digitally retouched fractal artworks, are not considered algorithmic, in our context.</p>

<h3>The Algorithm in Algorithmic Mathematical Artwork</h3>

<p>Algorithmic artwork might not be generated by a computer program. M
C Escher's artwork are examples of algorithmic artwork not generated by
computer programs. Computer generated algorithmic artworks might not be
generated algorithmically either. Here, “algorithmically generated” means
a program that distills the inherent algorithmic nature in a artwork. For
example, many tilings and patterns artwork today are spitted out by computer
programs, but the programs are written in a ad hoc, case-by-case basis,
consisting of drawing commands tweaked to match a desired output. Although
generated by a program, but the essence of creation is manual. What we
really want are programs in a form that embody, capture, or distill the
algorithmic nature of the artwork, as a executable specification by means
of recursion or symmetry code. The beauty of algorithmic artwork lies in
its inherent beauty of algorithmic pattern or symmetry, and its creation
process should be done that way. When this is achieved, and its algorithmic
essence is captured, and we can then create vast numbers of variations
by changing parameters or input. (This does not imply that results will
be similar, as we know from chaos theory.). Generating a algorithmic mathematical
art by a algorithmic process can be likened to specifying a Sequence by
Recursion , or a group by generators and relations , or modeling a physical
phenomen by a equation or cellular automata. It is a pursuit of elegance
that captures essence, and gives us a precise insight on relations.</p>

The discovery, experts say, could pave the way for new treatments and possibly new methods of screening.</p><p>Colon cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States and is expected to kill more than 53,000 people in the nation in 2024, according to the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank">American Cancer Society</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are rising sharply among younger people: The percentage of people younger than 55 diagnosed with colon cancer <a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21772" target="_blank">almost doubled</a> between 1995 and 2019, leaping from 11% to 20% of cases. What’s more, these cases are often diagnosed at <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/colon-cancer-deaths-younger-men-women-report-rcna134084" target="_blank">later, more aggressive stages</a>.</p><p>Experts are still struggling to explain the shift.</p><p>“Colorectal cancer is very treatable when caught early, but the cases in younger people are increasing and we don’t know why,” said Dr. Flavio Rocha, a surgical oncologist and physician in chief at the Oregon Health &amp; Science University’s Knight Cancer Institute, who was not involved in the study.&nbsp;</p><p>The new research doesn’t answer that question; it’s far too early to implicate this bacteria in the rise in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/colon-cancer-early-signs-symptoms-young-adults-rcna82629" target="_blank">cases in younger people</a>. What’s more, most of the patients in the study were over the age of 50.</p><p>But the findings raise “the question as to whether there are elevated levels of this bacterium in young onset colorectal cancer which is on the rise globally for unknown reasons,” said co-lead study author Susan Bullman, an assistant professor of human biology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle.</p><h2><strong>Bacteria with a secret</strong></h2><p>Scientists have suspected a link between the bacteria, called Fusobacterium nucleatum, and colorectal cancer growth for almost a decade. The bacteria is usually only found in the mouth, far from the colon.&nbsp;</p><p>In the mouth, it’s one of the most common types of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/bad-breath-certain-types-probiotic-bacteria-may-help-rcna62671" target="_blank">disease-causing bacteria</a>, linked to gum disease and plaque buildup. But it was unclear how it could withstand the journey through the gut and eventually invade tumor cells in places in the body where these types of bacteria usually don’t survive.</p><p>In the study, Bullman and her colleagues looked at the bacterial makeup of almost 200 colorectal tumors, as well as stool samples from more than 1,200 people, half of whom did not have cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>What they learned was that the bacteria was a bit more complicated than once thought. Namely, it has two distinct subspecies, one of which appears to shield colorectal tumors from cancer-fighting drugs.&nbsp;</p><p>“It acts like a cloak,” Bullman said.&nbsp;</p><p>Normally, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/two-early-trials-blood-cancer-treatment-appears-promising-deadly-brain-rcna143216" target="_blank">immune cells called T-cells</a> recognize and attack tumor cells. But this bacteria recruits another type of immune cell into the cancer cells, one that lets them escape the T-cells. </p><p>The stealthy subspecies was present in 50% of the colorectal tumors collected in the study. The corresponding stool samples also had elevated amounts of the subspecies, compared to their healthy counterparts.&nbsp;</p><p>“Patients who have high levels of this bacteria in their colorectal tumors have a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/colon-cancer-advanced-younger-symptoms-rcna72983" target="_blank">far worse prognosis</a>,” Bullman said. “They don’t respond as well to chemotherapy and they have an increased risk of recurrence.”&nbsp;</p><p>The subspecies may also cause cancer to form in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>When Bullman and her team transplanted the subspecies to mice, they appeared to cause precancerous polyps to form, one of the first warning signs of colorectal cancer, though she added that this causation hasn’t yet been proven in humans.</p><p>The researchers also found clues that may answer the question as to how Fusobacterium nucleatum can get to the colon in the first place: The bacterium appears to be able to survive the journey through the stomach, withstanding what scientists previously thought would be a toxic dose of stomach acid.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>New targets for treatment</strong></h2><p>The discovery of the subspecies has huge consequences for targeted therapies that are already underway, said Dr. Michael White, an assistant professor of colorectal surgery at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.</p><p>“There is evidence that if you clear these bacteria, there is more response during treatment,” said White, who was not involved with the new research. Clinical trials are slated to soon test whether treating a patient with antibiotics prior to chemotherapy will induce a better response, he said.</p><p>Knowing more about which bacterial subspecies, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, are dangerous will allow for a more targeted approach, he said.&nbsp;</p><p>That could potentially include prevention.</p><p>It’s possible that scientists could identify the subspecies while it’s still in the mouth and give a person antibiotics at that point, wiping it out before it could&nbsp; travel&nbsp; to the colon, Bullman said. Even if antibiotics can’t successfully eliminate the bacteria from the mouth, its presence there could serve as an indication that someone is at higher risk for aggressive colon cancer, she added.&nbsp;</p><p>Rocha agreed. In the future, part of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/colon-cancer-screening-blood-test-coming-approval-rcna143066" target="_blank">colorectal cancer screening</a> could be as simple as a mouth swab, he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Understanding the newly identified subspecies could also lead to the development of new antibiotics that would specifically target this bacterial subtype, rather than wiping out both forms of the bacteria or all of the bacteria in the mouth.</p><p>There’s also the possibility of harnessing the bacteria to do the cancer-fighting work.&nbsp;</p><p>The subtype has already proven that it can enter cancer cells quite easily, so it might be possible to genetically modify the bacteria to carry cancer-fighting drugs directly into the tumors, Bullman said.</p><p>Researchers are just beginning to scratch the surface of the ways a person’s microbiome plays a role in the individual’s cancer risk, Rocha said, but it’s one of the most important concepts being explored in cancer research today.</p></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><p><span data-testid="byline-thumbnail"></span><span data-testid="byline-name">Kaitlin Sullivan</span><span></span></p><p>Kaitlin Sullivan is a contributor for NBCNews.com who has worked with NBC News Investigations.&nbsp;She reports on health, science and the environment and&nbsp;is a graduate of the&nbsp;Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at City University of New York.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                on-demand video transcoder. You can also give the transcoding process a boost by using
                VA-API or NVENC hardware acceleration.

                Zoom in on your vacations around the world with the map view. Memories will automatically
                extract GPS data from your photos and plot them on a map. You can also find all
                photos at a location with its name with accurate reverse geocoding.

                Memories is built with performance in mind. It is designed and highly optimized for
                handling large photo libraries even when running on modest hardware such as a Raspberry Pi.
                It also relies on the battle tested Nextcloud platform as the underlying storage layer,
                which is used by thousands of organizations around the world.

                Memories stores most of the metadata in the EXIF headers of your photos, which means
                that you can easily migrate to other solutions without losing your data. It also utilizes
                your existing filesystem structure for organization without converting it to any
                specialized format.
