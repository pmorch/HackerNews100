<p>Being an independent journalist – or an office worker if you wish – I always reasoned that I needed a decent computer and that I need to pay for quality. Between 2000 and 2017, I consumed three laptops that I bought new and which cost me around 5,000 euros in total – roughly 300 euros per year over the entire period. The average useful life of my three laptops was 5.7 years.</p>
<p>In 2017, somewhere between getting <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-low-tech-website/">my office</a>, I decided not to buy any more new laptops. Instead, I switched to a 2006 second-hand machine that I purchased online for 50 euros and which does everything that I want and need. Including a new battery and a simple hardware upgrade, I invested less than 150 euros.</p>
<p>If my 2006 laptop lasts as long as my other machines – if it runs for another 1.7 years – it will have cost me only 26 euros per year. That’s more than 10 times less than the cost of my previous laptops. In this article, I explain my motivations for not buying new laptops, and how you could do the same.</p>
<h2 id="energy-and-material-use-of-a-laptop">Energy and material use of a laptop</h2>
<p>Not buying new laptops saves a lot of money, but also a lot of resources and environmental destruction. According to the most recent life cycle analysis, it takes 3,010 to 4,340 megajoules of primary energy to make a laptop – this includes mining the materials, manufacturing the machine, and bringing it to market. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Each year, we purchase between 160 and 200 million laptops. Using the data above, this means that the production of laptops requires a yearly energy consumption of 480 to 868 petajoules, which corresponds to between one quarter and almost half of all solar PV energy produced worldwide in 2018 (2,023 petajoules). <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> The making of a laptop also involves a high material consumption, which includes a wide variety of minerals that may be considered scarce due to different types of constraints: economic, social, geochemical, and geopolitical. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/06/the-monster-footprint-of-digital-technology/">production of microchips is a very energy- and material-intensive process</a>, but that is not the only problem. The high resource use of laptops is also because they have a very short lifespan. Most of the 160-200 million laptops sold each year are replacement purchases. The average laptop is replaced every 3 years (in business) to five years (elsewhere). <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> My 5.7 years per laptop experience is not exceptional.</p>
<h2 id="laptops-dont-change">Laptops don’t change</h2>
<p>The study cited dates from 2011, and it refers to a machine made in 2001: a Dell Inspiron 2500.  You are forgiven for thinking that this “most recent life cycle analysis of a laptop” is outdated, but it’s not. A 2015 research paper discovered that the embodied energy of laptops is static over time. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The scientists disassembled 11 laptops of similar size, made between 1999 and 2008, and weighed the different components. Also, they measured the silicon die area for all motherboards and 30 DRAM cards produced over roughly the same period (until 2011). They found that the mass and material composition of all key components – battery, motherboard, hard drive, memory – did not change significantly, even though manufacturing processes became more efficient in energy and material use.</p>
<p>The reason is simple: improvements in functionality balance the efficiency gains obtained in the manufacturing process. Battery mass, memory, and hard disk drive mass decreased per unit of functionality but showed roughly constant totals per year. The same dynamic explains why newer laptops don’t show lower operational electricity consumption compared to older laptops. New laptops may be more energy-efficient per computational power, but these gains are offset by more computational power. <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/01/bedazzled-by-energy-efficiency/">Jevon’s paradox</a> is nowhere as evident as it is in computing.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>
<p>All this means that there’s no environmental or financial benefit whatsoever to replacing an old laptop with a new one. On the contrary, the only thing a consumer can do to improve their laptop’s ecological and economic sustainability is to use it for as long as possible. This is facilitated by the fact that laptops are now a mature technology and have more than sufficient computational power. One problem, though. Consumers who try to keep working on their old laptops are likely to end up frustrated. I shortly explain my frustrations below, and I’m pretty confident that they are not exceptional.</p>

<h2 id="my-first-laptop-apple-ibook-2000-2005">My first laptop: Apple iBook (2000-2005)</h2>
<p>In 2000, when I was working as a freelance science and tech journalist in Belgium, I bought my first laptop, an Apple iBook. Little more than two or three years later, the charger started malfunctioning. When informed of the price for a new charger, I was so disgusted with Apple’s sales practices – chargers are very cheap to produce, but Apple sold them for a lot of money – that I refused to buy it. Instead, I managed to keep the charger working for a few more years, first by putting it under the weight of books and furniture, and when that didn’t work anymore, by putting it in a firmly tightened clamp.</p>
<h2 id="my-second-laptop-ibm-thinkpad-r52-2005-2013">My second laptop: IBM ThinkPad R52 (2005-2013)</h2>
<p>When the charger eventually died entirely in 2005, I decided to look for a new laptop. I had only one demand: it should have a charger that lasts or is at least cheap to replace. I found more than I was looking for. I bought an <a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:R52" target="_blank">IBM Thinkpad R52</a>, and it was love at first use. My IBM laptop was the Apple iBook counterpart, not just in terms of design (a rectangular box available in all colours as long as it’s black). More importantly, the entire machine was built to last, built to be reliable, and built to be repairable.</p>
<p><a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2019/06/how-to-make-wind-power-sustainable-again/">Circular and modular products are all the hype these days</a>, its lifetime could be extended endlessly by gradually repairing and replacing every part that it consists of. The question is not how we can evolve towards a circular economy, but instead why we continue to evolve away from it.</p>

<p>My Thinkpad was more expensive to buy than my iBook, but at least I didn’t spend all that money on a cute design but a decent computer. The charger gave no problems, and when I lost it during a trip and had to buy a new one, I could do so for a fair price. Little did I know that my happy purchase was going to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>

<h2 id="my-third-laptop-lenovo-thinkpad-t430-2013-2017">My third laptop: Lenovo Thinkpad T430 (2013-2017)</h2>
<p>Fast forward to 2013. I am now living in Spain and I’m running Low-tech Magazine. I’m still working on my IBM Thinkpad R52, but there are some problems on the horizon. First of all, Microsoft will soon force me to upgrade my operating system, because support for Windows XP is to end in 2014. I don’t feel like spending a couple of hundred euros on a new operating system that would be too demanding for my old laptop anyway. Furthermore, the laptop had gotten a bit slow, even after it had been restored to its factory settings. In short, I fell into the trap that the hardware and software industries have set up for us and made the mistake of thinking that I needed a new laptop.</p>
<p>Having been so fond of my Thinkpad, it was only logical to get a new one. Here’s the problem: in 2005, shortly after I had bought my first Thinkpad, Lenovo, a Chinese manufacturer that is now the largest computer maker in the world, bought IBM’s PC business. Chinese companies don’t have a reputation for building quality products, especially not at the time. However, since Lenovo was still selling Thinkpads that looked almost identical to those built by IBM, I decided to try my luck and bought a <a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:T430" target="_blank">Lenovo Thinkpad T430</a> in April 2013. At a steep price, but I assumed that quality had to be paid for.</p>
<p>My mistake was clear from the beginning. I had to send the new laptop back twice because its case was deformed. When I finally got one that didn’t wobble on my desk, I quickly ran into another problem: the keys started breaking off. I can still remember my disbelief when it happened for the first time. The IBM Thinkpad is known for its robust keyboard. If you want to break it, you need a hammer. Lenovo obviously didn’t find that so important and had quietly replaced the keyboard with an inferior one. Mind you, I can be an aggressive typist, but I have never broken any other keyboard.</p>
<p>I grumpily ordered a replacement key for 15 euros. In the months after that, replacement keys became a recurring cost. After spending more than 100 euros on plastic keys, which would soon break again, I calculated that my keyboard had 90 keys and that replacing them all just once would cost me 1,350 euros. I stopped using the keyboard altogether, temporarily finding a solution in an external keyboard. However, this was impractical, especially for working away from home – and why else would I want a laptop?</p>
<p>There was no getting around it anymore: I needed a new laptop. Again. But which one? For sure it would not be one made by Lenovo or Apple.</p>

<h2 id="my-fourth-laptop-ibm-thinkpad-x60s-2017-now">My fourth laptop: IBM Thinkpad X60s (2017-now)</h2>
<p>Not finding what I was looking for, I decided to go back in time. By now, it had dawned on me that new laptops are of inferior quality compared to older laptops, even if they carry a much higher price tag.  I found out that Lenovo switched keyboards around 2011 and started searching auction sites for Thinkpads built before that year. I could have changed back to my ThinkPad R52 from 2005, but by now, I had become accustomed to a Spanish keyboard, and the R52 had a Belgian one.</p>
<p>In April 2017, I settled on a used <a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:X60s" target="_blank">Thinkpad X60s</a> from 2006. <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> As of December 2020, the machine is in operation for almost 4 years and is 14 years old – three to five times older than the average laptop. If I loved my Thinkpad R52 from 2005, I adore my Thinkpad X60s from 2006. It’s just as sturdily built – it already survived a drop from a table on a concrete floor – but it’s much smaller and also lighter: 1.43 kg vs. 3.2 kg.</p>
<p>My 2006 Thinkpad X60s does everything I want it to do. I use it to write articles, do research, and maintain the websites. I have also used it on-stage to give lectures, projecting images on a large screen. There’s only one thing missing on my laptop, especially nowadays, and that’s a webcam. I solve this by firing up the cursed 2013 laptop with the broken keys whenever I need to, happy to give it some use that doesn’t involve its keyboard. It could also be solved by a switch to the <a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:X200" target="_blank">Thinkpad X200</a> from 2008, which is a newer version of the same model and has a webcam.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-make-an-old-laptop-run-like-its-new">How to make an old laptop run like it’s new</h2>
<p>Not buying any more new laptops is not as simple as buying a used laptop. It’s advisable to upgrade the hardware, and it’s essential to downgrade the software. There are two things you need to do:</p>
<h2 id="1-use-low-energy-software">1. Use low energy software</h2>
<p>My laptop runs on <a href="https://www.linuxliteos.com/" target="_blank">Linux Lite</a>, one of several open-source operating systems <a href="https://lotoftech.com/10-best-lightweight-operating-system-for-old-computers/" target="_blank">specially designed to work on old computers</a>. The use of a Linux operating system is not a mere suggestion. There’s no way you’re going to revive an old laptop if you stick to Microsoft Windows or Apple OS because the machine would freeze instantly. Linux Lite does not have the flashy visuals of the newest Apple and Windows interfaces, but it has a familiar graphical interface and looks anything but obsolete. It takes very little space on the hard disk and demands even less computing power. The result is that an old laptop, despite its limited specifications, runs smoothly. I also use light browsers: <a href="https://vivaldi.com/" target="_blank">Vivaldi</a> and <a href="https://astian.org/en/midori-browser/" target="_blank">Midori</a>.</p>
<p>Having used Microsoft Windows for a long time, I find Linux operating systems to be remarkably better, even more so because they are free to download and install. Furthermore, Linux operating systems do not steal your personal data and do not try to lock you in, like the newest operating systems from both Microsoft and Apple do. That said, even with Linux, obsolescence cannot be ruled out. For example, Linux Lite will stop its support for 32-bit computers in 2021, which means that I will soon have to look for an alternative operating system, or buy a slightly younger 64-bit laptop.</p>
<h2 id="2-replace-the-hard-disk-drive-with-a-solid-state-drive">2. Replace the hard disk drive with a solid-state drive</h2>
<p>In recent years, solid-state drives (SSD) have become available and affordable, and they are much faster than hard disk drives (HDD). Although you can revive an old laptop by merely switching to a light-weight operating system, if you also replace the hard disk drive with a solid-state drive, you’ll have a machine that is just as fast as a brand new laptop. Depending on the storage capacity you want, an SSD will cost you between 20 euro (120 GB) and 100 euro (960 GB).</p>
<p>Installment is pretty straightforward and well documented online. Solid-state drives run silently and are more resistant to physical shock, but they have a shorter life expectancy than hard disk drives. Mine is now working for almost 4 years. It seems that both from an environmental and financial viewpoint, an old laptop with SSD is a much better choice than buying a new laptop, even if the solid-state drive needs replacement now and then.</p>
<h2 id="spare-laptops">Spare laptops</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, my strategy has evolved. I have bought two identical models for a similar price, in 2018 and early 2020, to use as spare laptops. Now I plan to keep working on these machines for as long as possible, having more than sufficient spare parts available. Since I bought the laptop, it had two technical issues. After roughly a year of use, the fan died. I had it repaired overnight in a tiny and messy IT shop run by a Chinese man in Antwerp, Belgium. He said that my patched fan would run for another six months, but it’s still working more than two years later.</p>
<p>Then, last year, my X60s suddenly refused to charge its battery, an issue that had also appeared with my cursed 2013 laptop. It seems to be a common problem with Thinkpads, but I could not solve it yet. Neither did I really have to because I had a spare laptop ready and started using that one whenever I needed or wanted to work outside.</p>

<h2 id="the-magical-sd-card">The magical SD-card</h2>
<p>Now to introduce you to my magical SD-card, which is another hardware upgrade that facilitates the use of old (but also new) laptops. Many people have their personal documents stored on their laptop’s hard drive and then make backups to external storage media if all goes well. I do it the other way around.</p>
<p>I have all my data on a 128 GB SD-card, which I can plug into any of the Thinkpads that I own. I then make monthly backups of the SD-card, which I store on an external storage medium, as well as regular backups of the documents that I am working on, which I temporarily store on the drive of the laptop that I am working on. This has proven to be very reliable, at least for me: I have stopped losing work due to computer problems and insufficient backups.</p>
<p>The other advantage is that I can work on any laptop that I want and that I’m not dependent on a particular machine to access my work. You can get similar advantages when you keep all your data in the cloud, but the SD-card is <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/why-we-need-a-speed-limit-for-the-internet/">the more sustainable option</a>, and it works without internet access.</p>
<p>Hypothetically, I could have up to two hard drive failures in one day and keep working as if nothing happened. Since I am now using both laptops alternately – one with battery, the other one without – I can also leave them at different locations and cycle between these places while carrying only the SD-card in my wallet. Try that with your brand new, expensive laptop. I can also use my laptops together if I need an extra screen.</p>
<p>In combination with a hard disk drive, the SD-card also increases the performance of an old laptop and can be an alternative to installing a solid-state drive. My spare laptop does not have one and it can be slow when browsing heavy-weight websites. However, thanks to the SD-card, opening a map or document happens almost instantly, as does scrolling through a document or saving it. The SD-card also keeps the hard disk running smoothly because it’s mostly empty. I don’t know how practical using an SD-card is for other laptops, but all my Thinkpads have a slot for them.</p>
<h2 id="the-costs">The costs</h2>
<p>Let’s make a complete cost calculation, including the investment in spare laptops and SD-card, and using today’s prices for both solid-state drives and SD-cards, which have become much cheaper since I have bought them:</p>
<ul>
<li>ThinkPad X60s: 50 euro</li>
<li>ThinkPad X60s spare laptop: 60 euro</li>
<li>ThinkPad X60 spare laptop: 75 euro</li>
<li>Two replacement batteries: 50 euro</li>
<li>240 GB solid-state drive: 30 euro</li>
<li>128 GB SD-card: 20 euro</li>
<li>Total: 285 euros</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you buy all of this, you only spent 285 euros. For that price, you may be able to buy the crappiest new laptop on the market, but it surely won’t get you two spare laptops. If you manage to keep working with this lot for ten years, your laptop costs would be 28.5 euros per year. You may have to replace a few solid-state drives and SD-cards, but it won’t make much difference. Furthermore, you save the ecological damage that is caused by the production of a new laptop every 5.7 years.</p>

<h2 id="dont-take-it-too-far">Don’t take it too far</h2>
<p>Although I have used my Thinkpad X60s as an example, the same strategy works with other Thinkpad models – <a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkPad_History" target="_blank">here’s an overview of all historical models</a> – and laptops from other brands (which I know nothing about). If you prefer not to buy on auction sites, you can walk to the nearest pawnshop and get a used laptop with a guarantee. The chances are that you don’t even need to buy anything, as many people have old laptops lying around.</p>
<p>There’s no need to go back to a 2006 machine. I hope it’s clear that I am trying to make a statement here, and I probably went as far back as one can while keeping things practical. My first try was a used ThinkPad X30 from 2002, but that was one step too far. It uses a different charger type, it has no SD-card slot, and I could not get the wireless internet connection working. For many people, it may serve to choose a somewhat younger laptop. That will give you a webcam and a 64-bit architecture, which makes things easier. Of course, you can also try to beat me and go back to the 1990s, but then you’ll have to do without USB and wireless internet connection.</p>
<p>Your choice of laptop also depends on what you want to do with it. If you use it mainly for writing, surfing the web, communication, and entertainment, you can do it as cheaply as I did. If you do graphical or audiovisual work, it’s more complicated, because in that case, you’re probably an Apple user. The same strategy could be applied, on a somewhat younger and more expensive laptop, but it would suggest switching from a Mac to a Linux operating system. When it comes to office applications, Linux is clearly better than its commercial alternatives. For a lack of experience, I cannot tell you if that holds for other software as well.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-a-hack-not-a-new-economical-model">This is a hack, not a new economical model</h2>
<p>Although capitalism could provide us with used laptops for decades to come, the strategy outlined above should be considered a hack, not an economical model. It’s a way to deal with or escape from an economic system that tries to force you and me to consume as much as possible. It’s an attempt to break that system, but it’s not a solution in itself. We need another economical model, in which we build all laptops like pre-2011 Thinkpads. As a consequence, laptop sales would go down, but that’s precisely what we need. Furthermore, with today’s computing efficiency, we could significantly reduce the operational and embodied energy use of a laptop if we reversed the trend towards ever higher functionality.</p>
<p>Significantly, hardware and software changes drive the fast obsolescence of computers, but the latter has now become the most crucial factor. A computer of 15 years old has all the hardware you need, but it’s not compatible with the newest (commercial) software. This is true for operating systems and every type of software, from games to office applications to websites. Consequently, to make laptop use more sustainable, the software industry would need to start making every new version of its products lighter instead of heavier. The lighter the software, the longer our laptops will last, and we will need less energy to use and produce them.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's filled with crap like this:</p>

<pre><code>    for i in range(n_results, 0, -1):
        try:
            return self._collection.query(
                query_texts=query_texts,
                query_embeddings=query_embeddings,
                n_results=i,
                where=where,
                **kwargs,
            )
</code></pre>

<p>and this:</p>

<pre><code>def embed_documents(self, texts: List[str]) -&gt; List[List[float]]:
    texts = list(map(lambda x: x.replace("\n", " "), texts))
    embeddings = self.client.encode(texts, **self.encode_kwargs)
    return embeddings.tolist()
</code></pre>

<p>and this:</p>

<pre><code>class CharacterTextSplitter(TextSplitter):
    """Implementation of splitting text that looks at characters."""

def __init__(self, separator: str = "\n\n", **kwargs: Any):
    """Create a new TextSplitter."""
    super().__init__(**kwargs)
    self._separator = separator

def split_text(self, text: str) -&gt; List[str]:
    """Split incoming text and return chunks."""
    # First we naively split the large input into a bunch of smaller ones.
    if self._separator:
        splits = text.split(self._separator)
    else:
        splits = list(text)
</code></pre>

<p>In short: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/OffEJTR.gifv">https://i.imgur.com/OffEJTR.gifv</a></p>

<p>Embeddings is just a do-nothing wrapper for SentenceTransformers. Chroma is just a do-nothing wrapper for ChromaDB. It's filled with "helper" functions that just call normal Python functions. A dedicated TextSplitter that calls split() from builtins.py? What? Why? Templates are no more useful than calling .replace() on a string. "texts" are just strings and "documents" are just a pointless dict that contain "texts." Just load the strings from your datasource yourself. The README is both grandiose and vague. The documentation is out-of-date and inconsistent. The import footprint is weirdly massive--highly modularized but nothing seems to do anything that'd take more than a few CPU cycles. There's not really a standard interoperable datatype, so you're actually led further afield than if you had just clearly defined the simple lists and strings required for hitting an LLM. </p>

<p>The very concept of chaining operations when interacting with LLMs doesn't really make sense to me: it's basically one <code>requests</code> call to a generation backend, but it's not like it even handles websockets and streaming for you. Why chain together wrapper classes when you can just do the operations yourself?</p>

<p>This seems like a beginner's project that blew up because it's riding a tidal wave of interest in the broader topic.</p>

<p>I don’t think that is true. If free threading is possible, the cat will be out of the bag, even developers that only cares about single threaded work will still be affected by threading issues. If a library starts a thread in the background for whatever reason, they can cause threading issue in my code even though I never subscribed for having threading problems.</p>
<p>Many libraries that had async-to-sync bridges spawns threads to simulate async tasks. Django, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy is just a few off the top of my head. And then there’s tools like IPython that starts a couple background threads for who knows what reasons.</p>
<p>Multithreading has a reputation for being hard. But really, I think they are considered hard <strong>because</strong> of the existence of free threading. Languages like Rust that doesn’t have free threading (or to be more precise, it has an almost free threading with some severe restrictions) actually fared better at making multithreading a lot easier to use.</p>
<p>The arena-based threading with subinterpreters I had mentioned earlier would be that similar sort of that almost-free threading with forced discipline.</p>
<p>One way to think of arena-based threading is that it’s basically like a dynamic/runtime borrow checker, enforcing acquisition of the arena locks before working with any objects owned by the arena. I think it can even be flexible enough to allow future experimentation with non standard arenas that have different borrowing rules.</p>

<p>There are language-level tools like golang’s race condition detector, thread sanitizer, etc, which take the common mistakes and test for them. It’s also possible someone could implement something like a borrow checker or thread safety heuristics on top of python’s type system, e.g. with passthrough types along the lines of Mutable / Immutable / Shared / Local, and auditing nonlocal variable access or object types passed into threads.</p>

<p>This wouldn’t be the case with my proposal to make threads take a voluntary lock by default. In a sense, you could leave something like the GIL in place, but make it safe to release for specific threads while accessing python code/objects.</p>

<p>I don’t think anyone has demonstrated how this would happen, and I’d view it as a fundamental flaw in the implementation if it could.</p>
<p>I’m not saying it’s impossible, but I think it would be useful to have specific examples–even if only theoretical–before it’s considered a significant problem.</p>

<p>I guess this is a bit too open ended. I think the thread in question can only interact with your code unintentionally if you happen to share a resource with that thread in an unsafe way, furthermore to be scary it would need to be an unsafe way that isn’t possible today. Even with the GIL another thread can already do a lot of things, like mess with your file descriptors, stdout, signals. And threads sharing access to any variable is already inconsistent for non-atomic ops at the Python level.</p>

              <p>Again, of course. <sup><a href="#footnote-102472-1" id="footnote-ref-102472-1">[1]</a></sup> But I understood that <a href="https://discuss.python.org/u/pf_moore">@pf_moore</a> made the very fine point that due to specialisations we are discussing here (e.g. <code>BINARY_SUBSCR_DICT</code>), and hence the GIL, things which are nominally not thread-safe are effectively so in current CPython, because they are specialised to a single native instruction. And this, I think, only needs an explicit specification for whether or not such operations are to be considered effectively “atomic” or not. Otherwise, yes, these are just undiscovered bugs, currently protected by a CPython implementation detail.</p>

<p>The word “can” here translates to (potentially) decades of work, which was the case for Java:</p>

<p>Yes we “can” (and likely should), but it requires serious commitment, and off-hand “others do it too” is not helpful here.</p>
<p>In the context Java and threading, it’s worth noting how threads commonly need quite a lot of developer-facing infrastructure (e.g. thread pools) that’s probably very hard to make beginner-friendly / “Pythonic”, and that they’re on a similarly large multi-{year,person} effort to move from free threads to virtual threads<sup><a href="#footnote-102482-1" id="footnote-ref-102482-1">[1]</a></sup> under <a href="https://openjdk.org/projects/loom/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Project “Loom”</a> (where – arguably – the boundaries to async programming start getting blurred), and encapsulating a lot of that in simpler interfaces through <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/453" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">“structured concurrency”</a>, which we have already (at least through <code>trio</code>).</p>
<p>All that to say: if we argue “Java can”, then we should also look at where those choices have led them, and what they consider as “moving forward” from there. But realistically, we’re very far from an apples-to-apples comparison in any case, and it’s better to leave that rhetorical tool hanging in the shed.</p>

<p>PEP-703 on the other hand, goes pretty much all the way (though stop-the-world GC may still be a limitation) for those willing to learn how to use it and for those who already have experience with threads from other languages. Python “popularity” will increase with projects choosing it for a multicore program when it will become an option.</p>
<p>Will some users hurt themselves with free threading? I’ve been tracking nogil for a long while now and from what I’ve seen, for someone who writes threadsafe code already (but not native extensions) it will be really hard to run into trouble.</p>

              <p>I just want to throw in a use case which has not yet been discussed here and in the discussions of PEP 703: GUI toolkits.</p>
<p>GUI toolkits are naturally using threads and therefore an approach where free threading is replaced by a different concept like sub interpreters or multiprocessing is problematic in the design &amp; architecture of GUI applications written in python (because the toolkits being exposed in python are not aware of such concepts and most likely offer plain threading for offloading computational workload from the GUI). I’m a user of the PySide (Qt for python) project, and the PySide devs did struggle with the GIL as explained here <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-for-python-5.15.0-is-out" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Qt for Python 5.15.0 is out!</a> (and also the links inside the document).</p>
<p>The problem of when it’s better to release or not to release the GIL in the C extensions of GUI toolkits is not straightforward, sometimes counter-intuitive (at least to me) and often there is a compromise involved depending on most common use cases but with drawbacks for other use cases.</p>
<p>Moreover, when creating GUI applications in python, you start struggling with the GIL when you have huge workloads happening in the background. My use case is a computer vision GUI which acts as a monitor and development environment for remote embedded systems. It is similar to what <a href="https://discuss.python.org/u/lunixbochs">@lunixbochs</a> reported for the realtime audio use case - keeping latencies and stutters on an acceptable level is unnecessarily difficult when you have to fight against the GIL mechanism.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t this be a potential problem today? “Not thread-safe” doesn’t mean “not thread-safe only when used in a free-threaded environment.”</p>
<p>I’m not trying to be difficult, maybe a bit pedantic. The presence of the GIL can obscure threading bugs or make them rear their ugly heads less often, but it doesn’t make code thread-safe. <a href="https://discuss.python.org/u/colesbury">@colesbury</a>’s work to remove the GIL has done a lot to remove places in the interpreter, stdlib, and some third-party libraries that relied on the GIL (knowingly or not). Most (all? almost all?) of that work will have been in C code, not Python code.</p>

<p>I think it could be a problem today, don’t know, I have the same question. I’m here to be curious.</p>
<p>Again as an interesting anecdotal data point here is a port of that troublesome C code to Python: <a href="https://gist.github.com/bluss/a3d2ad94d55382f682897ee1efae6d74" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">mtenv.py</a><br>
Here’s how it runs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Python 3.11.3 this program loops for a long time without problem</li>
<li>I compiled and used nogil-3.12 commit 4526c07caee8f2e (current tip of the repo)<br>
and it runs 1-2 seconds before it <strong>segfaults</strong> in getenv just like the C code from 2017.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a reduced example. It doesn’t look like a normal Python program, it has a strange shape so that it can reproduce a crash easily. But the fundamental elements can occur in normal Python programs - various C calls that libraries use that use getenv - let’s say mktime to use the example from that blog post - and for setenv we have plain interface to it in <code>os</code> (<code>os.getenv</code> is <em>not</em> a plain interface to C <code>getenv</code>).</p>

            <p>Yes, it is a problem today, without free threading. getenv + setenv thread safety is a problem for Python applications I run at work. We had to do a bunch of whackamole to work around segfaults resulting from extension libraries using getenv + setenv (for a while we gave up and used a terrible <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> hack)</p>

<p>At the high level this is the kind of thing I’d <strong>love someone to try creating</strong> for per-subinterpreter-GIL use! This is also quite hard, but I assume there are interested folks out there.</p>
<p>Intuitively I <em>expect</em> this winds up being the same problem that needs to be solved for free threading <em>(which PEP-703 appears to do)</em>: our pure reference counting model is the most significant reason we have a GIL - in order to share objects between multiple threads you need to make the reference counts work without that single lock.</p>
<p>Someone really needs to try creating explicitly shared objects implementation for CPython and subinterpreters to prove or disprove it’s actual utility. In the absence of that, I wouldn’t point to it and suggest it is a <em>better</em> solution. I consider it an open avenue of future work. <em>(Even if we get free threading, performant explicit sharing would be something I expect many would appreciate having.)</em></p>

<p>Digital advertising is a scam from top to bottom. In fact, it’s several scams stacked on top of each other, wearing a trenchcoat, and some of the foundations of fibs are so effective that otherwise reasonable people entirely buy into them. </p>



<h2>Data-driven ads are anything but</h2>



<p>I’ll start with a few examples of the data which is definitely held on me, and just how entirely bad my targeted advertising is. </p>



<p>Facebook know my age and date of birth. They have had this data since I signed up for the website, 15 years ago. They know exactly how old I am. They also know where I live. Hell, sometimes I used to check into places with my location on. Despite knowing I am way north of 30 and way south of Birmingham, they are incredibly keen on advertising me events explicitly limited to people under the age of 30 in the Birmingham area. </p>



<p>Google knew I wanted to buy a mattress. They knew this because I googled it. And I clicked through to a brand selling mattresses, and I bought myself a mattress. The brand know I googled said mattress. Google know I clicked through. From Google’s own analytics, they ought to know I bought the mattress. Since buying that mattress, I’ve been constantly advertised mattresses, especially the one I already own and they know I already own. </p>



<p>Some might claim that in fact the advertisers are being incredibly smart and they’re advertising me activities for women under 30 in Birmingham so I go and tell my friends who are under 30 in Birmingham to go and do that. But of course, Facebook would also know that I don’t have any friends in that demographic. Or maybe that mattress seller is trying to tell me to refer a friend to buy that mattress by reminding me that I own a very nice mattress. In which case, why isn’t it advertising the referral programme, which I know they have because I received several emails and a physical leaflet about it with the fucking mattress?</p>



<p>The more simple answer is that the advertisers aren’t being data driven at all. They’re ticking default boxes or casting wider nets. I’m getting advertised mattresses because I have ~an interest in mattresses~. I’m getting activities for women under 30 in Birmingham because I’m under 40 and on the same island as Birmingham.</p>



<p>For all the buzzwords about “data-driven” and “smart” and whatever else you want to call it, the advertisers are just going “eh, sounds about right” and letting a robot automate their job. </p>



<p>This, then, is the first grift in the chain. Despite claiming to their boss that they’re using “data-driven” advertising, they’re targeting their ads even less than taking out a quarter page in the local newspaper. </p>



<h2>The product: they could spy on you (but don’t)</h2>



<p>Everyone is rightly nervy about the sheer quantity of data that big companies hold on us. Social media companies know all about your demographic information, social connections and interests. Amazon knows exactly when you have an outbreak of aphids because you buy things to kill the nasty little beasties, and it probably also knows when you’ve had a nasty breakup because nobody listens to Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours on repeat at 3am when they’re in a good place. Google basically knows everything about you. </p>



<p>At least that’s the theory. And that’s the product that they’re selling to advertisers. They have an enormous dataset from which everything an advertiser could ever dream of about a person can be garnered. They’re the world’s biggest, bestest spy network, which means they have quality data to help <em>your</em> business be the biggest, bestest business reaching the biggest, bestest customers.</p>



<p>At least that’s what they say. </p>



<p>Actual spying requires actual spies. There’s a reason intelligence agencies are such big employers: they have all of their fancy spy computers, but they know they need to hire humans to actually deduce patterns and sort signal from noise. They’re aware that a human brain is always superior to a computer in figuring this out, so they get humans to do the work.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, tech companies break into hives at the thought of getting a human to do a job. Their ethos is that if a human can do a task, a machine can do that task better, and not cost them anything such as salary, pensions or or a basic level of respect. Tech companies are fatally allergic to getting a human to do a human job, so content moderation is largely an algorithm looking for the word “boobies”. A tech company would go into anaphylactic shock at the very notion of employing a human to analyse their vast dataset.</p>



<p>So it’s all machine learning, and the machines are very, very stupid. Have you ever looked at your list inferred interests on a social media platform? If you ever tweeted “I don’t like Game of Thrones, it’s not for me,” you’ll be classified as interested in Game of Thrones and possibly get served ads for it. These machines may also attempt to deduce your age, gender, and so forth based on half-baked crap fed into them, and it seldom comes up right. Maybe that’s why it thinks I’m under 30 and in Birmingham. Perhaps I internet in a Brummie accent. </p>



<p>It’s no wonder that on multiple occasions, big tech has been caught out completely making things up when communicating with advertisers, and they continue to do so. Facebook was famously found to have inflated or outright fabricated video metrics. GA4 very quietly admits that the data is padded out with machine learning. The data is a lie, and a lot of it is because they literally haven’t the first clue on what to do with it, they just need to steeple their fingers and act all evil so advertisers think they have it.</p>



<p>Advertisers, then, are getting served a steaming turd on a plate rather than the medium-rare filet mignon they were promised. </p>



<p>And meanwhile, the spies don’t even need that data, because your posts are public anyway.</p>



<p>But enough about that. The problem is this grift is, too, built upon a grift. </p>



<h2>Marketing science is a grift</h2>



<p>I work in marketing, for my sins. This is mostly why I’m so entirely down on the marketing industry and many of the people who work in it. I also happen to have an MSc in psychology – actual psychology! – with a focus on behaviour change. </p>



<p>On day 1 of your class about behaviour change in a science course, you learn that behaviour change is not a simple matter of information in, behaviour out. Human behaviour, and changing it, is big and complex. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, on your marketing courses, which I have had the misfortune to attend, the model of changing behaviour is pretty much this: information in, behaviour out.</p>



<p>The thing with the entire “science” of marketing is the underpinning theory base is basic common sense which has been treated with a bit of a brand makeover, turned into a couple of overcomplicated diagrams with some neologisms obscuring meaning. Digital marketing has become very popular because baked into it are a whole bunch of metrics so you have something to show your manager that you’re not spending the entire day tending your geraniums, but do the metrics really mean anything?</p>



<p>The metrics that marketers are told they need are marketed to them by the marketing department of a company that specialises in making products for marketers. And that company was probably started up by someone who worked in marketing. </p>



<p>Marketing theory is never tested rigorously. The <s>common sense</s> incredibly sound scientific view based on heaps of scientific evidence view – showing your ads to people more likely to buy your product is more efficient because they’re more likely to buy your product anyway – is entirely untested.</p>



<p>There’s an anecdote that a glitch with Facebook led to ads no longer being targeted over a period of several weeks. And absolutely nobody noticed because the metrics all looked normal, the engagement and purchasing was just the same.</p>



<p>There isn’t any evidence to suggest that an ad targeted to 35 year old men with children with an interest in football is any more likely to result in sales of Football Dad socks than a poster for Football Dad socks at a bus stop. But an entire industry is based on pretending that this is the case.</p>



<h2>tl;dr</h2>



<p>Facebook will try to sell you Football Dad socks even if you’re a 55 year old childfree woman who posted once about hating football, because that data is utterly useless. </p>



<p>Spies are probably reading your posts though, no matter how boring.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I’ve been working on a Rust-based physics engine for about a year now, and a week ago I finally released it. Here is <a href="https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd">Bevy XPBD</a> 0.1.0!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-bevy-xpbd">What is Bevy XPBD?</h2>
<p>Bevy XPBD is a 2D and 3D physics engine for <a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</a>, a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust.</p>
<p>It uses a newer physics simulation method called <em>Extended Position Based Dynamics</em>, which provides unconditionally stable, time step independent, and physically accurate simulations. Unlike other physics engines in the Bevy ecosystem, Bevy XPBD is made specifically <em>for</em> Bevy <em>with</em> Bevy, and it uses the <em>Entity Component System</em> (ECS) for both the public API and the internals.</p>
<p>Bevy XPBD 0.1 already has tons of features, including these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic, kinematic and static rigid bodies</li>
<li>Collision detection and collision response</li>
<li>Collision events</li>
<li>Access to colliding entities</li>
<li>Sensor colliders</li>
<li>Collision layers</li>
<li>Restitution and friction</li>
<li>Gravity, external forces and torque</li>
<li>Joints</li>
<li>Built-in XPBD constraints and support for custom constraints</li>
<li>Modular plugin architecture, allowing you to swap existing functionality with custom implementations</li>
<li>Configurable timestep and subtepping</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>If you are new to Rust or Bevy, you should go through Bevy’s <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/">Getting started guide</a>.</p>
<p>Once you are ready, you need to add Bevy XPBD to your <code>Cargo.toml</code>. You should use <code>bevy_xpbd_2d</code> for 2D projects and <code>bevy_xpbd_3d</code> for 3D projects.</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>[</span><span>dependencies</span><span>]</span></span>
<span><span>bevy_xpbd_3d = </span><span>"0.1.0"</span></span></code></pre>
<p>By default, Bevy XPBD uses <code>f32</code> numbers. If you encounter instability or use a large number of substeps, you might want to use <code>f64</code> instead. You can disable the default features and manually specify the feature flags you want:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>[</span><span>dependencies</span><span>]</span></span>
<span><span># Add 3D Bevy XPBD with double-precision floating point numbers</span></span>
<span><span>bevy_xpbd_3d = { version = </span><span>"0.1"</span><span>, default-features = </span><span>false</span><span>, features = [</span><span>"3d"</span><span>, </span><span>"f64"</span><span>] }</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Next, add the <code>PhysicsPlugins</code> plugin group. Bevy XPBD is highly modular, and this plugin group adds all of the default physics plugins to your application.</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>bevy_xpbd_3d</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*</span><span>;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>.</span><span>add_plugins</span><span>(</span><span>DefaultPlugins</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>.</span><span>add_plugins</span><span>(</span><span>PhysicsPlugins</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>        // ...your other plugins, systems and resources</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>();</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Now you can use all of Bevy XPBD’s components and resources to build whatever you want! For example, adding a rigid body with a collider is as simple as spawning an entity with the <code>RigidBody</code> and <code>Collider</code> components:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>setup</span><span>(</span><span>mut</span><span> commands</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Commands</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>    commands</span><span>.</span><span>spawn</span><span>((</span><span>RigidBody</span><span>::</span><span>Dynamic</span><span>, </span><span>Collider</span><span>::</span><span>ball</span><span>(</span><span>0.5</span><span>)));</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>To learn more, refer to the <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_xpbd_3d/0.1.0/bevy_xpbd_3d/">official documentation</a> and check out the <a href="https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd">GitHub repository</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd/tree/main/crates/bevy_xpbd_2d/examples">2D</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd/tree/main/crates/bevy_xpbd_3d/examples">3D</a> examples.</p>
<h2 id="why-make-a-physics-engine-for-bevy">Why make a physics engine for Bevy?</h2>
<p>I started development purely out of interest. I had been playing around with Bevy for a little while when I saw a <a href="https://johanhelsing.studio/posts/bevy-xpbd">tutorial series by Johan Helsing</a> where he created a simple XPBD physics engine for Bevy from scratch. I had seen a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0QwAhUnpr4">Two Minute Papers video</a> on the topic earlier, so I decided to follow the tutorial and build along.</p>
<p>The tutorial series wasn’t/isn’t finished yet, so I quickly reached the end. I had 2D objects colliding realistically with each other, but lots of features were missing: friction, 3D support, joints, and a lot of other common physics engine capabilities. I decided to continue developing the engine, reading academic papers on XPBD and taking inspiration from existing physics engines like <a href="https://rapier.rs/">Rapier</a>.</p>
<p>As I continued adding features and improving the API, I realized that I was actually starting to have a decently functional physics engine. I started seeing some interest in my engine on the <a href="https://discord.gg/bevy">Bevy Discord server</a>, and I realized that this was truly a lacking area in the ecosystem. Bevy doesn’t have an official physics engine yet, and <code>bevy_rapier</code> is essentially the only good option, but it’s just a wrapper over Rapier and doesn’t use Bevy’s ECS for any of its internals. People would prefer a more native solution that is made specifically for Bevy and uses the ECS directly instead of relying on a separate physics world and synchronizing a monolithic data structure with the Bevy world.</p>
<p>This is what I am trying to accomplish with Bevy XPBD. As far as I know, it is the only pure Bevy ECS physics engine that is currently maintained, and I hope to continue on this road to help improve the state of physics in the Bevy ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>Bevy XPBD is already quite usable in many cases, but it is missing several important features, and there are some stability and performance issues. Keep in mind that the engine is very young and physics engines can be quite massive, so it can take a while to reach a production ready state.</p>
<p>0.2 will be released in a couple of weeks, right after the release of Bevy 0.11. Here are some of the features and improvements that I have in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update to Bevy 0.11</li>
<li>Spatial queries
<ul>
<li>Ray casting</li>
<li>Shape casting</li>
<li>Point projection</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Filters for collisions and spatial queries (exclude entities etc.)</li>
<li>Multiple colliders per body</li>
<li>Collider offset and scale</li>
<li>Bug fixes and documentation improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>Further into the future, I am planning on implementing some of these features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physics scale (e.g. pixels per meter)</li>
<li>Joint motors</li>
<li>Soft bodies and cloth simulation</li>
<li>Locking translational and rotational axes</li>
<li>Parallel solver to improve performance</li>
<li>Full cross-platform determinism</li>
<li>A website for WASM demos</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that after 0.2, development might be a lot more inconsistent for a while because of my studies, as I will be graduating from high school next year, and I will have my matriculation exams in September and March. However, I will try to keep up with Bevy releases and respond to issues and questions, and I hope to work on the engine more actively once I am done with my exams.</p>
<h2 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>Huge thanks to everyone on the <a href="https://discord.gg/bevy">Bevy Discord server</a> who has been interested in the project and helped me get this far, and especially to <a href="https://johanhelsing.studio/">Johan Helsing</a> who inspired me to originally begin development and later helped me with the project. Without your help I would have probably stopped development and abandoned the project, and I am very glad I didn’t.</p>
<p>It’s crazy to me how we have reached over 120 stars on GitHub just a week after release, and I think it just shows how much the community wants a native physics engine that is made specifically for Bevy in an ergonomic ECS-based way.</p>
<p>I hope to continue working on Bevy XPBD as much as I can, and to continue being a part of the amazing community. Stay tuned for the next update in a couple of weeks when 0.2 is released!</p>

A microservice architecture is the perfect way to pretend that the code you wrote last month no longer exists!

Rolling green fields forever!</p><p>Got a question about how one of your dependencies works? You could look at its implementation, or the test suite, but most engineers prefer to go to the place that everyone congregates to talk about - but not look at - code.

Why do you think it's taking so long? You're asking them to do the thing they hate most - look at someone else's code!</p><p>Most people reading this have at one point or another approved a non-trivial pull request with a simple "LGTM."

<p>Organizations are increasingly adopting hybrid and multi-cloud strategies to access the latest compute resources, consistently support worldwide customers, and optimize cost. However, a major challenge that engineering teams face is operationalizing AI applications across different platforms as the stack changes. This requires MLOps teams to familiarize themselves with different environments and developers to customize applications to run across target platforms.</p>



<p>NVIDIA offers a consistent, full stack to develop on a GPU-powered on-premises or on-cloud instance. You can then deploy that AI application on any GPU-powered platform without code changes.<strong></strong></p>



<h2>Introducing the latest NVIDIA Virtual Machine Image</h2>



<p>The NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack Virtual Machine Image (VMI) is GPU-accelerated. It comes pre-installed with Cloud Native Stack, which is a reference architecture that includes upstream Kubernetes and the NVIDIA GPU Operator. NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack VMI enables you to build, test, and run GPU-accelerated containerized applications orchestrated by Kubernetes.</p>



<p>The NVIDIA GPU Operator automates the lifecycle management of the software required to expose GPUs on Kubernetes. It enables advanced functionality, including better GPU performance, utilization, and telemetry. Certified and validated for compatibility with industry-leading Kubernetes solutions, GPU Operator enables organizations to focus on building applications, rather than managing Kubernetes infrastructure.</p>



<p>NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack VMI is available on AWS, Azure, and GCP.</p>



<h2>Now Available: Enterprise support by NVIDIA</h2>



<p>For enterprise support for NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack VMI and GPU Operator, &nbsp;purchase NVIDIA AI Enterprise through an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about-nvidia/partners/partner-locator/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">NVIDIA partner</a>.</p>



<p>Developing AI solutions from concept to deployment is not easy. Keep your AI projects on track with NVIDIA AI Enterprise Support Services. Included with the purchase of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite, this comprehensive offering gives you direct access to NVIDIA AI experts, defined service-level agreements, and control of your upgrade and maintenance schedules with long-term support options. Additional services, including training and AI workload onboarding, are available.<strong></strong></p>



<h2>Run:ai is now certified on NVIDIA AI Enterprise</h2>



<p>Run:ai, an industry leader in compute orchestration for AI workloads, has certified NVIDIA AI Enterprise, an end-to-end, secure, cloud-native suite of AI software, on their Atlas platform.&nbsp;This additional certification enables enterprises to accelerate the data science pipeline. They can focus on streamlining the development and deployment of predictive AI models to automate essential processes and gain rapid insights from data.</p>



<p>Run:ai provides an AI Computing platform that simplifies the access, management, and utilization of GPUs in cloud and on-premises clusters. Smart scheduling and advanced fractional GPU capabilities ensure that you get the right amount of compute for the job.</p>



<p>Run:ai Atlas includes GPU Orchestration capabilities to help researchers consume GPUs more efficiently. They do this by automating the orchestration of AI workloads and the management and virtualization of hardware resources across teams and clusters.</p>



<p>Run:ai can be installed on any Kubernetes cluster, to provide efficient scheduling and monitoring capabilities to your AI infrastructure. With the NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack VMI, you can add cloud instances to a Kubernetes cluster so that they become GPU-powered worker nodes of the cluster.</p>



<p>Here’s testimony from one of our team members: “As an engineer, without the NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack VMI, there is a lot of manual work involved. With the Cloud Native Stack VMI, it was two clicks and took care of provisioning Kubernetes and Docker and the GPU Operator. It was easier and faster to get started on my work.”</p>



<h2>Set up a Cloud Native Stack VMI on AWS</h2>



<p>In the AWS marketplace, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-cucpqpmvqkajy?sr=0-2&amp;ref_=beagle&amp;applicationId=AWSMPContessa" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener">launch an NVIDIA Cloud Native Stack VMI</a> using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/launch-marketplace-console.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener">Launch an AWS Marketplace instance</a> instructions.</p>



<p>Ensure that the <a href="https://docs.run.ai/admin/runai-setup/cluster-setup/cluster-prerequisites/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener">necessary prerequisites</a> have been met and install Run:ai using the <a href="https://docs.run.ai/admin/runai-setup/cluster-setup/cluster-install/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener">Cluster Install</a> instructions. After the installation, on the <strong>Overview</strong> dashboard, you should see that the metrics begin to populate. On the <strong>Clusters</strong> tab, you should also see the cluster as connected.</p>



<p>Next, add a few command components to the kube-apiserver.yaml file to enable user authentication on the Run:ai platform. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.run.ai/admin/runai-setup/authentication/researcher-authentication/?h=researcher+api#administration-user-interface-setup" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener">Administration User Interface Setup</a>.</p>



<p>By default, you can find the kube-apiserver.yaml file in the following directory:</p>


<div><pre title="">/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
</pre></div>


<p>You can <a href="https://docs.run.ai/admin/runai-setup/authentication/researcher-authentication/?h=oidc#mandatory-kubernetes-configuration" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener">validate that the oidc commands were successfully applied</a> by the kube-apiserver. Look for the <code>oidc</code> commands in the output.</p>



<pre><code>spec:
&nbsp; containers:
&nbsp; - command:
&nbsp; &nbsp; - kube-apiserver
&nbsp; &nbsp; - --oidc-client-id=runai
&nbsp; &nbsp; - --oidc-issuer-url=https://app.run.ai/auth/realms/nvaie
&nbsp; &nbsp; - --oidc-username-prefix=-</code></pre>



<p>Set up the <a href="https://docs.run.ai/admin/admin-ui-setup/overview/#setup" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener">Unified UI</a> and <a href="https://docs.run.ai/admin/admin-ui-setup/project-setup/?h=projects" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener">create a new project</a>. Projects help to dictate GPU quota guarantees for data scientists and researchers who are using the Run:ai platform.</p>



<p>Name the new project and give the project at least one assigned GPU. For this post, I created one project with a two-GPU quota and another project with no GPU quota, labeled <code>nvaie-high-priority</code> and <code>nvaie-low-priority</code>, respectively After the project is created, you can <a href="https://docs.run.ai/admin/researcher-setup/cli-install/?h=researcher+command+line+interface#install-runai-cli" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener">install the Run:ai CLI tool</a>, which enables you to submit workloads to the cluster.</p>



<p>The following commands use the runai CLI to submit a job (job1 or job2) leveraging a Docker image called quickstart. Quickstart contains TensorFlow, CUDA, a model, and data that feeds in and trains the model. It leverages one GPU for training (-g 1) and is submitted on behalf of the low-priority or high-priority project denoted by the <code>-p</code> parameter. </p>



<p>Deploy a few test jobs to show some of Run:ai’s orchestration functionality by running:</p>


<div><pre title="">runai submit job1 -i gcr.io/run-ai-demo/quickstart -g 1 -p nvaie-high-priority 
runai submit job2 -i gcr.io/run-ai-demo/quickstart -g 1 -p nvaie-low-priority
</pre></div>


<p>You can check the status of the jobs by running:</p>


<div><pre title="">runai describe job job1 -p nvaie-high-priority
runai describe job job2 -p nvaie-low-priority
</pre></div>


<p>Both workloads are now training on the GPUs, as you can see on the <strong>Overview</strong> dashboard.</p>



<p>You can submit an additional workload to highlight your job preemption capabilities. Currently, the <code>nvaie-high-priority</code> project is guaranteed access to both GPUs since their Assigned GPU quota is set to 2. You can submit an additional workload for the <code>nvaie-high-priority</code> project and observe that you are preempting the <code>nvaie-low-priority</code> job.</p>



<p>The job preemption enables you to look at the <a href="https://docs.run.ai/Researcher/best-practices/convert-to-unattended/?h=checkpoint#checkpoints" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener">checkpointing process</a> for the training workloads, save the current progress at the checkpoint, and then preempt the workload to remove it from the GPU. Save the training progress and free up the GPU for a higher-priority workload to run.</p>


<div><pre title="">runai submit job3 -i gcr.io/run-ai-demo/quickstart -g 1 -p nvaie-high-priority
</pre></div>


<p>You can check the status of the job by running:</p>


<div><pre title="">runai describe job job3 -p nvaie-high-priority
</pre></div>


<p>If you go back to the overview dashboard, you’ll see the two jobs running for the <code>nvaie-high-priority</code> project and the workload from <code>nvaie-low-priority</code> preempted and placed back into the pending queue. The workload in the pending queue is automatically rescheduled when a GPU becomes available.</p>



<p>To clean up your jobs, run the following commands:</p>


<div><pre title="">runai delete job job1 -p nvaie-low-priority 
runai delete job job2 job3 -p nvaie-high-priority 
</pre></div>


<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>NVIDIA offers a consistent, full stack to develop on a GPU-powered on-premises or on-cloud instance. Developers and MLOps can then deploy that AI application on any GPU-powered platform without code change. </p>



<p>Run:ai, an industry leader in compute orchestration for AI workloads, has certified NVIDIA AI Enterprise, an end-to-end, secure, cloud-native suite of AI software, on its Atlas platform.

	<div>
		<p>Here’s a question for you. When did Alan Partridge <em>first</em> appear on television? </p>
<p>Caveats: a) I specifically mean television. Radio is brilliant, and also outside the scope of this article. b) For now, ignore any unbroadcast pilots. I’m talking about actual, broadcast telly. c) I do mean material <em>exclusive</em> to television, not just part of a radio programme aired on TV.</p>
<p>If you immediately went for the first episode of <cite>The Day Today</cite>, on the <strong>19th January 1994</strong>, then join the club. That’s exactly where my mind went at first. So that would be this trademark awkward exchange between Chris and Alan:</p>

<p>But wait! The day before each episode of <cite>The Day Today</cite> aired, BBC2 broadcast <cite>The Day Today MiniNews</cite>, three minutes of extra material which served essentially as an extended trail for the next day’s episode. Or in other words: the closest you’d get to deleted scenes this side of a LaserDisc, at least in the first half of the 90s.</p>
<p>Partridge makes an appearance in the first one, which was broadcast on the <strong>18th January 1994</strong>:</p>

</p>
<p>So is that the answer? Not quite. Because, of course, there were trails<sup id="rf1-21721"><a href="#fn1-21721" title="The BBC term is trails, not trailers, despite someone trying to correct me on this earlier in the year." rel="footnote">1</a></sup> running for the series the week before air. Here’s one from the <strong>14th January 1994</strong>, which features a brief bit of Partridge:</p>

</p>
<p>Incidentally, isn’t that a great trail? For all that Chris Morris has the reputation for scowling at publicity, you couldn’t ask for a better introduction to the show.</p>
<p>The above would usually cause me to make a variety of shrill and unpleasant noises, as I vainly tried to find the first transmission of a trail for the series. Luckily, we can sidestep that problem entirely. Because Partridge had an even earlier appearance on TV.</p>
<p><span id="more-21721"></span>On the <strong>18th December 1993</strong>, BBC Two ran one of it’s regular theme nights. You know, a <em>proper</em> theme night, when the Beeb actually had the money to make new programmes, and craft beautiful links between them. This one was under the <cite>Arena</cite> banner, and was called <cite><a href="https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/3a839bae20c64e0f8217f2bcb77da017">Radio Night</a></cite>.</p>
<p>I would describe it as a simulcast between BBC2 and Radio 4, except that isn’t strictly true; that would imply that both services played exactly the same thing. Part of the joy of the evening was that both services were playing slightly different soundtracks, so your radio and television could <em>talk</em> to each other. This video of the opening programme, which combines the two soundtracks, gives you a rough idea of what it was like:</p>
<p>
<iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_j7dOejmZI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<p>Of course, these days, this kind of experimentation would be not only virtually impossible, but <em>actually</em> impossible. The varying digital delays between the different versions of each service would kill the idea stone dead. That’s progress for you.</p>
<p>But we could talk about <cite>Radio Night</cite> all, erm, night. Let’s get to the point. One of the segments that evening was called “TV Theft, Radio Rip-Off”, all about radio shows which transferred to television. And who do you think showed up?</p>
<p>
<iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7xfQue7daD8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<p>OK, OK, so it’s just a voiceover with a picture, sure. But I think it counts. The very first televised appearance of Alan Partridge. Almost exactly a month before the first transmission of <cite>The Day Today</cite>.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>The following really is for hardcore production date nerds only. You have been warned. But something about that <cite>Radio Night</cite> segment gives me pause. </p>
<p>Here’s the relevant bit from the Partridge voiceover:</p>
<blockquote><p>“So, given that screen image is all-important, I need more time to contemplate the optical implications of Alan Partridge. In the meantime, I’m happy to enclose a photograph which is strictly to be considered a work in progress.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words: TV Partridge isn’t quite cooked yet. Fair enough. At this point, <cite>The Day Today</cite> hadn’t even aired.</p>
<p>Mind you, it would be instructive to find out exactly <em>when</em> the photograph was taken, so we could know exactly when this “work in progress” snapshot was. Alas, this has proved difficult; unless you’re lucky, and the photo you want to investigate shows up in a stock library, you’re often out of luck.<sup id="rf2-21721"><a href="#fn2-21721" title="The paperwork for <cite>Radio Night</cite> is no help; it simply gives Steve Coogan’s agent as the source." rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Suffice to say that photos from this session have shown up in many places, including the cover to commercial releases of the radio <cite>Knowing Me, Knowing You</cite> itself.</p>
<p>Luckily, we don’t actually need to know the date of the photo; there’s another way to figure out when this version of Partridge hails from. Let’s take a look at another of the earliest “optical implications” of him – the unbroadcast pilot for <cite>The Day Today</cite>, on the 2004 DVD release:</p>

<p>You will note that pilot Partridge looks virtually identical to the photo used in <cite>Radio Night</cite>, with even the top being the same:</p>

<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.dirtyfeed.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/earlypartridge2.jpeg" alt="Steve Coogan as Partridge in The Day Today pilot">
</p>
</div>
<p>In his book <cite>Disgusting Bliss: The Brass Eye of Chris Morris</cite>, Lucian Randall says that the pilot of <cite>The Day Today</cite> was “completed in January 1993”. I can independently verify this; the VT clock for that pilot is dated <strong>29th January 1993</strong>. So the pilot for <cite>The Day Today</cite> was shot in <strong>either December 1992 or January 1993</strong>. Which gives us a rough date for this particular limbo incarnation of Partridge.</p>
<p>Next, let’s talk about the actual series of <cite>The Day Today</cite>. The location shoot, as per the production paperwork, was <strong>“June/July 1993”</strong>; around six months after the pilot. The studio sessions were <strong>6th-8th October 1993</strong>, and the <strong>13th-15th October 1993</strong>; around ten months after the pilot.<sup id="rf3-21721"><a href="#fn3-21721" title="I have to say, despite the huge amounts of location material, I’m still vaguely surprised that <cite>The Day Today</cite> only had six days in the studio, considering the complexity of the show." rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Location (June/July 1993)</strong></p>
</div>
<div><p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.dirtyfeed.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tdt-studio.jpeg" alt="Alan Partridge, in the studio"></p>
<p><strong>Studio (October 1993)</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Meanwhile, the Partridge section of Arena’s <cite>Radio Night</cite>? The paperwork confirms that it was written by Steve Coogan and Patrick Marber; but the production dates for the programme as a whole are what we’re interested in here:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>13-16; 22, 23 September/<br>
14, 28 &amp; 29 October 1993</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Which really does leave us in an interesting quandry. The location footage for <cite>The Day Today</cite> was shot before the <cite>Radio Night</cite> piece, that we can be fairly sure of. But the studio material is rather more debatable. If the <cite>Radio Night</cite> skit was made in September, it was indeed before the studio material in <cite>The Day Today</cite>; once you creep into October, it starts getting more questionable.</p>
<p>In other words: it is very possible that the “optical implications” of <cite>Partridge</cite> were still in flux at the time of the making of the <cite>Arena</cite> documentary. But they were a little less in flux than the team strictly let on to the viewer, seeing as all the location material for <cite>The Day Today</cite> had <em>already been recorded</em>. And by the time <cite>Radio Night</cite> was actually broadcast, Partridge was fully out of limbo anyway, as <cite>The Day Today</cite> had finished production.</p>
<p>Comedy history is always messier than anyone wants it to be, isn’t it?</p>

MyHouse starts as expected, in a Middle America clapboard house with healthy shrubs outside and <em>Doom </em>demons inside.

            <span>Abstract:</span>  Matrix multiplication consumes a large fraction of the time taken in many
machine-learning algorithms. Thus, accelerator chips that perform matrix
multiplication faster than conventional processors or even GPU's are of
increasing interest. In this paper, we demonstrate a method of performing
matrix multiplication without a scalar multiplier circuit. In many cases of
practical interest, only a single addition and a single on-chip copy operation
are needed to replace a multiplication. It thus becomes possible to design a
matrix-multiplier chip that, because it does not need time, space- and
energy-consuming multiplier circuits, can hold many more processors, and thus
provide a net speedup.

<p><a href="http://jfloren.net/b/">Back to blog archive</a></p><p><strong>Posted 2023/7/7</strong></p>
<div>


<p>I switched to ProtonMail a few years back after getting fed up with Google. It’s been mostly acceptable, but a few months ago the Android client started mangling emails – if I hit “send” too soon, it would send out only part of what I’d typed; I had to wait 10 seconds or so after I finished typing before hitting send to be sure it sent. I figured I’d switch to some other email client instead, since I wasn’t particularly in love with the Proton app anyway.</p>

<p>My solution was to set up the <a href="https://proton.me/mail/bridge">Proton Bridge</a> in a VM on my NAS, then used rinetd to forward incoming connections on the IMAP and SMTP ports to the bridge (which only listens on 127.0.0.1). I then set up tailscale on that box and on my phone; with that, I could connect any Android email client (I like <a href="https://email.faircode.eu/">FairEmail</a>) to my Proton account. I was also accessing it from Linux using Claws.</p>

<p>Everything was great until I decided the other day that I’d <em>also</em> like to do PGP signing on my outgoing messages. I exported a signing-only subkey to my Android device and configured FairEmail+OpenKeyring to use it, then I also set up Claws on Linux for PGP/MIME.</p>

<p>When I sent a test message to myself, though, Claws and FairEmail didn’t have any clue that it was signed. If I switched to PGP inline, it worked. I sent an email to one of the Claws maintainers, who reported that my MIME structure was all messed up. He sent me a signed message back, and Claws was able to verify the signature just fine.</p>

<p>It turns out that Proton has been breaking outgoing PGP signatures from the beginning: <a href="https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-bridge/issues/26">https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-bridge/issues/26</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-bridge/issues/320">https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-bridge/issues/320</a>. It seems that their argument is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>When you send a regular email via Proton to another Proton client, they automatically PGP sign+encrypt the message. (I think this is great!)</li>
<li>Their automatic signing+encryption cannot coexist with a user-applied signature.</li>
<li>Therefore, all user-applied signatures will be broken. Tough luck, bucko, we’re the SECURE email company, you’ll upload your private key to our servers and you’ll like it!</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s absurd that there’s no way to disable this, no option to tell Proton “if you see a multipart/signed or multipart/encrypted message, just leave it the hell alone.”</p>

<p>I’m looking at other potential email hosts. I know PGP isn’t widely used, but I have a hard time swallowing Proton’s silent mangling of my email, and I especially dislike their smarmy we-know-better attitude when people complain about it.</p>

<p>In this article, we will discuss a series of vulnerabilities that when exploited in succession, could enable a low-privilege user in ServiceNow to gain unauthorized full administrative access to the ServiceNow instance.</p>

<p>ServiceNow is a cloud-based platform that provides service management software as a service (SaaS). It is used by a millions of companies worldwide, and specializes in IT Service Management (ITSM), IT Operations Management (ITOM), and IT Business Management (ITBM). It allows users to manage incidents, service requests, problems, and changes within the IT infrastructure of a business. It also provides a self-service portal where end users can request IT services and log issues.</p>

<p>While working internally as a security engineer on the offensive security team, we routinely scrutinize the security of third-party platforms that integrate with our systems and processes. This is a crucial step to verify the security of these platforms and prevent potential breaches that could expose our sensitive data. During a recent engagement in mid-2022 our security team was able to exploit a number of vulnerabilities in ServiceNow leading to an effective account takeover to obtain administrative access on the platform as a low privileged user.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-the-servicenow-application"><span>Exploring the ServiceNow application</span><a href="#exploring-the-servicenow-application"><i></i></a></h2>

<p>While exploring the ServiceNow application, we determined that the application uses <code>.do</code> pages. <code>.do</code> endpoints are often associated with Java servlets, which are used to process requests and return dynamic content. As these pages query server-side resources, it should be secured against unauthorized or unintended access to prevent users from gaining access to sensitive functionality.</p>

<p>ServiceNow also uses Xml Http Requests (XHR), which is a fundamental technology behind Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX). The use of these API calls are to allow the performance of various operations without needing a full refresh of the page, which can improve the usability and efficiency of the application. ServiceNow widely uses XHR requests to update records or interacting with certain server-side resources or ‘processors’.</p>

<p>The application also uses the Glide Query Language (GQL), which is an proprietary, object-oriented language that forms the basis for the ServiceNow API to perform CRUD operations on its database. In essence, GQL serves as an abstraction layer for SQL operations that allows developers to perform database operations without interacting with raw SQL.</p>

<p>As a low privilege user, we discovered that it was not possible to directly access many of the application’s functionalities. An example is shown below, where we attempted to view the <code>$interactive_analysis.do</code> page:</p>

<p><img width="872" alt="image" data-src="/assets/images/ServiceNow_Images/interactive_do.png" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://x64.sh/assets/images/ServiceNow_Images/interactive_do.png"></p>

<p>However, while navigating through the application, there are some locations that inadventently redirect us to sensitive pages by appending query strings needed to create a valid request. Due to insufficient access control being implemented, we discovered that a standard user could access the <code>$interactive_analysis.do</code> endpoint if the query string was correctly formatted. We can send the following request to successfully access the <code>$interactive_analysis.do</code> page:</p>

<pre><code>https://somehost.service-now.com/$interactive_analysis.do?sysparm_field=password&amp;sysparm_table=sys_user&amp;sysparm_from_list=true&amp;sysparm_query=active%3Dtrue%5Ecaller_id%3Djavascript:gs.getUserID()&amp;sysparm_list_view=&amp;sysparm_tiny_url=f040a8971ba38150d88b624c274bcbb3  
</code></pre>

<p>This is shown below:</p>

<p><img width="967" alt="image" data-src="/assets/images/ServiceNow_Images/chart_do.png" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://x64.sh/assets/images/ServiceNow_Images/chart_do.png"></p>

<p>This is a very interesting functionality, because at first glance it provides the low privilege user with a graphical representation of all the users that are within the application, which could potentially signal that potentially sensitive information is being retrieved through some database.</p>

<h2 id="discovering-the-xhr-request-behind-interactive-analysis"><span>Discovering the XHR request behind ‘Interactive Analysis</span><a href="#discovering-the-xhr-request-behind-interactive-analysis"><i></i></a></h2>

<p>Through further investigation, we determined that the <code>$interactive_analysis.do</code> page, as well as the corresponding <code>report_viewer.do</code> (by accessing the chart from a separate page), sends an XHR request to <code>xmlhttp.do</code> with the “ChartDataProcessor” processor in the POST request. The initial output is quite complex, however it is possible to decode/trim the request and simplify it to the following POST body:</p>

<div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>sysparm_request_params={"page_num":"0","series":[{"table":"sys_user","groupby":"name","filter":"","plot_type":"horizontal_bar"}]}&amp;sysparm_processor=ChartDataProcessor 
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div>

<h2 id="enumerating-tables-using-glide-query-language-gql"><span>Enumerating tables using Glide Query Language (GQL)</span><a href="#enumerating-tables-using-glide-query-language-gql"><i></i></a></h2>

<p>We identified that ServiceNow sent an XHR request to <code>xmlhttp.do</code> with the “ChartDataProcessor” processor in a GQL format. As previously mentioned, Glide Query Language is a language that is specifically used for ServiceNow, and the processors were scripts that run server-side that can be called through the XHR request. It is similar to SQL in the format structure sent in the POST request.</p>

<p>We identifed that the following parameters are of interest:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>table</code>: The specific database table used by the application.</li>
  <li><code>groupby</code>: Retrieves the rows from the specified column. This only retrieves the first 10 values used for rendering the chart/graph, however we can modify the “page_num” to enumerate all the values.</li>
  <li><code>filter</code>: Filtering the results retrieved from the GQL query.</li>
</ul>

<p>Leveraging this access control issue we enumerated a number of databases using Burp Suite Intruder and online documentation used by developers of ServiceNow third party plugins. This section of the test required a lot of trial and error to identify potentially useful tables, as there were hundreds of different tables containing varying degrees of sensitive data. We identified that the following tables were particularly interesting for a threat actor:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>sys_db_object</code>: Retrieves the complete list of tables used by the application.</li>
  <li><code>sys_user</code>: List of all users</li>
  <li><code>sys_emails</code>: List of all emails</li>
</ul>

<p>According to the documentation, to be able to view ServiceNow tables we need to have read access to at least the ServiceNow tables <code>sys_db_object</code>, <code>sys_dictionary</code>, and <code>sys_glide_object</code>, and in addition to that to the tables you want to view, including referenced tables. However we were not allowed to access certain fields such as the <code>user_password</code> column in the <code>sys_user</code> table, as this would be an easy method to obtain privilege escalation against the system. Through further enumeration however, we were able to find two additional interesting tables, which will prove to be extremely useful later on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>sys_user_session</code>: Retrieves the “glide_session_store” and “X-Usertoken” used by any account.</li>
  <li><code>sys_user_token</code>: Partially retrieves the “glide_user_activity” value.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="constructing-a-valid-session-to-escalate-privileges-to-administrator"><span>Constructing a valid session to escalate privileges to Administrator</span><a href="#constructing-a-valid-session-to-escalate-privileges-to-administrator"><i></i></a></h2>

<p>When testing the application and enumerating the database using the GQL language, we also noted that a valid authenticated session requires the following cookies/headers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First method: The <code>glide_user_activity</code> and <code>glide_session_store</code> cookies, and the <code>X-Usertoken</code> header to be correctly set, OR</li>
  <li>Second method: The <code>JSESSIONID</code> cookie and the <code>X-Usertoken</code> header to be correctly set.</li>
</ul>

<p>As it was possible to leak the tables we assumed that <code>sys_user_session</code> and <code>sys_user_token</code> would be all we needed to steal other accounts. While this was true there proved to be more nuance that made it more difficult to exploit.</p>

<p>The second method initially stood out since the knowledge of a <code>JSESSIONID</code> cookie and the <code>X-Usertoken</code> header would lead to an effective account takeover of any logged in administator user. Ultimately, we were unable to obtain the <code>JSESSIONID</code> from any table, however it may be possible to leverage XSS/CSRF for a successful account takeover, but this was never attempted because we were able to retrieve a valid pathway to exploitation using the first method. The steps are outlined as follows:</p>

<p>Firstly, we can use the following query to retrieve the <code>glide_session_store</code>, which is used to store session information for users. Each record represents a unique session for each user, as well as other related information:</p>

<div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>sysparm_request_params={"page_num":"0","series":[{"table":"sys_user_session","groupby":"id","filter":"nameCONTAINS[Insert_Admin_Email_Here]^invalidatedISNULL","plot_type":"horizontal_bar"}]}&amp;sysparm_processor=ChartDataProcessor 
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div>

<p>Note that the results are filtered by the name of the target user, which we can enumerate using the <code>sys_user</code> table - this can also help us determine who the administrators of the instance are. The <code>^invalidatedISNULL</code> removes all the invalidated or expired tokens.</p>

<p>Secondly, we need to retrieve the <code>X-Usertoken</code> value from the <code>sys_user_session</code> table, which is the CSRF token that the application provides users to ensure that requests made are genuine and not malicious. We require this token to make subsequent requests to the server.</p>

<div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>sysparm_request_params={"page_num":"0","series":[{"table":"sys_user_session","groupby":"csrf_token","filter":"nameCONTAINS[Insert_Admin_Email_Here]^invalidatedISNULL","plot_type":"horizontal_bar"}]}&amp;sysparm_processor=ChartDataProcessor 
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div>

<p>The most difficult aspect was to determine a valid <code>glide_user_activity</code> token. A standard <code>glide_user_activity</code> token looks like this:</p>

<div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>U0N2M18xOmV4VFozT2Eyb2p0OVVWcXY5WktIeUl2L2h5MjFBMlY1d3RnRWkrUVpkZnM9Ok9NNzFIRDV1S0ZBMy90L1plMW5oQXk0OWliYVdBMXFlZUc5cmE3aGdPQ1E9
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div>

<p>We can make the following request to retrieve the partial token from the database:</p>

<div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>sysparm_request_params={"page_num":"0","series":[{"table":"sys_user_token","groupby":"token","filter":"nameCONTAINS[Insert_Admin_Email_Here]","plot_type":"horizontal_bar"}]}&amp;sysparm_processor=ChartDataProcessor 
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div>

<p>However the values that were retrieved from <code>sys_user_token</code> appeared as follows:</p>

<p><img width="967" alt="image" data-src="/assets/images/ServiceNow_Images/jwt_error.png" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://x64.sh/assets/images/ServiceNow_Images/jwt_error.png"></p>

<p>Each <code>glide_user_activity</code> token could be base64 decoded however, revealing that the value from <code>sys_user_token</code> was the first half of the token:</p>

<p><img width="967" alt="image" data-src="/assets/images/ServiceNow_Images/jwt_decode.png" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://x64.sh/assets/images/ServiceNow_Images/jwt_decode.png"></p>

<p>Through trial and error, we determined that the signature section of the token was not sufficiently validated when sent to the server, and it was possible to simply replace or remove the second half of the token to create a valid token.</p>

<p>With all three requirements satisfied, it was then possible to takeover any account including administrative accounts with an active session on the ServiceNow instance. ServiceNow also implements impersonation to allow admin to login into any user account for debugging purposes, we were able to use the admin account to impersonate a spefical user admin account and grant our account admin privileges on the ServiceNow instance.</p>

<h2 id="ending-statement"><span>Ending Statement</span><a href="#ending-statement"><i></i></a></h2>

<p>Overall, we were able to leverage several vulnerabilities to escalate privileges from a standard user account to administrator of the ServiceNow instance. The following vulnerabilities allowed us to gain effective account takeover:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Insecure access control in the “ChartDataProcessor” processor</li>
  <li>Overly permissive read access to sensitive tables in ServiceNow database</li>
  <li>Insufficient signature validation of the <code>glide_user_activity</code> token</li>
</ul>

<p>While the root cause of the issue was due to a insecure access control, the other vulnerabilties discovered and chained together took a medium impact bug to a critical impact bug with a CVSS score of <em><code>9.9 - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H&amp;version=3.1</code></em></p>

<h2 id="credits"><span>Credits</span><a href="#credits"><i></i></a></h2>

<p>The multiple vulnerabilities leading to full compromise of the ServiceNow instance were discovered by Luke Symons, Tony Wu, Eldar Marcussen, Gareth Phillips, Jeff Thomas, Nadeem Salim, and Stephen Bradshaw.</p>

<section id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This tutorial is a short and practical introduction to linear algebra as it
applies to game development. Linear algebra is the study of vectors and their
uses. Vectors have many applications in both 2D and 3D development and Godot
uses them extensively. Developing a good understanding of vector math is
essential to becoming a strong game developer.</p>

</section>
<section id="coordinate-systems-2d">
<h2>Coordinate systems (2D)<a href="#coordinate-systems-2d" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In 2D space, coordinates are defined using a horizontal axis (<code><span>x</span></code>) and a
vertical axis (<code><span>y</span></code>). A particular position in 2D space is written as a pair of
values such as <code><span>(4,</span> <span>3)</span></code>.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_axis1.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_axis1.png">
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>If you're new to computer graphics, it might seem odd that the
positive <code><span>y</span></code> axis points <strong>downwards</strong> instead of upwards, as you
probably learned in math class. However, this is common in most
computer graphics applications.</p>
</div>
<p>Any position in the 2D plane can be identified by a pair of numbers in this way.
However, we can also think of the position <code><span>(4,</span> <span>3)</span></code> as an <strong>offset</strong> from the
<code><span>(0,</span> <span>0)</span></code> point, or <strong>origin</strong>. Draw an arrow pointing from the origin to the
point:</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_xy1.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_xy1.png">
<p>This is a <strong>vector</strong>. A vector represents a lot of useful information. As well
as telling us that the point is at <code><span>(4,</span> <span>3)</span></code>, we can also think of it as an
angle <code><span>θ</span></code> (theta) and a length (or magnitude) <code><span>m</span></code>. In this case, the arrow
is a <strong>position vector</strong> - it denotes a position in space, relative to the
origin.</p>
<p>A very important point to consider about vectors is that they only represent
<strong>relative</strong> direction and magnitude. There is no concept of a vector's
position. The following two vectors are identical:</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_xy2.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_xy2.png">
<p>Both vectors represent a point 4 units to the right and 3 units below some
starting point. It does not matter where on the plane you draw the vector, it
always represents a relative direction and magnitude.</p>
</section>
<section id="vector-operations">
<h2>Vector operations<a href="#vector-operations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can use either method (x and y coordinates or angle and magnitude) to refer
to a vector, but for convenience, programmers typically use the coordinate
notation. For example, in Godot, the origin is the top-left corner of the
screen, so to place a 2D node named <code><span>Node2D</span></code> 400 pixels to the right and 300
pixels down, use the following code:</p>
<div aria-labelledby="tab-0-R0RTY3JpcHQ=" id="panel-0-R0RTY3JpcHQ=" name="R0RTY3JpcHQ=" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0"><pre><span></span><span>$</span><span>Node2D</span><span>.</span><span>position</span> <span>=</span> <span>Vector2</span><span>(</span><span>400</span><span>,</span> <span>300</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Godot supports both <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2.html#class-vector2"><span>Vector2</span></a> and <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector3.html#class-vector3"><span>Vector3</span></a> for 2D and 3D usage, respectively. The same mathematical rules
discussed in this article apply to both types, and wherever we link to
<code><span>Vector2</span></code> methods in the class reference, you can also check out their
<code><span>Vector3</span></code> counterparts.</p>
<section id="member-access">

<h3>Adding vectors<a href="#adding-vectors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When adding or subtracting two vectors, the corresponding components are added:</p>

</pre></div>
<p>We can also see this visually by adding the second vector at the end of
the first:</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_add1.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_add1.png">
<p>Note that adding <code><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span></code> gives the same result as <code><span>b</span> <span>+</span> <span>a</span></code>.</p>

<h3>Scalar multiplication<a href="#scalar-multiplication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Vectors represent both direction and magnitude. A value representing
only magnitude is called a <strong>scalar</strong>. Scalars use the

<p>Multiplying a vector by a scalar does not change its direction, only
its magnitude. This is how you <strong>scale</strong> a vector.</p>
</div>

</section>
<section id="practical-applications">
<h2>Practical applications<a href="#practical-applications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let's look at two common uses for vector addition and subtraction.</p>
<section id="movement">
<h3>Movement<a href="#movement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A vector can represent <strong>any</strong> quantity with a magnitude and direction. Typical
examples are: position, velocity, acceleration, and force. In this image, the
spaceship at step 1 has a position vector of <code><span>(1,</span> <span>3)</span></code> and a velocity vector of
<code><span>(2,</span> <span>1)</span></code>. The velocity vector represents how far the ship moves each step. We
can find the position for step 2 by adding the velocity to the current position.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_movement1.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_movement1.png">
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>Velocity measures the <strong>change</strong> in position per unit of time. The new
position is found by adding the velocity multiplied by the elapsed time
(here assumed to be one unit, e.g. 1 s) to the previous position.</p>
<p>In a typical 2D game scenario, you would have a velocity in pixels per
second, and multiply it by the <code><span>delta</span></code> parameter (time elapsed since
the previous frame) from the <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_node.html#class-node-method-process"><span>_process()</span></a>
or <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_node.html#class-node-method-physics-process"><span>_physics_process()</span></a>
callbacks.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="pointing-toward-a-target">
<h3>Pointing toward a target<a href="#pointing-toward-a-target" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In this scenario, you have a tank that wishes to point its turret at a robot.
Subtracting the tank's position from the robot's position gives the vector
pointing from the tank to the robot.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_subtract2.webp" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_subtract2.webp">
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>To find a vector pointing from <code><span>A</span></code> to <code><span>B</span></code>, use <code><span>B</span> <span>-</span> <span>A</span></code>.</p>
</div>
</section>
</section>
<section id="unit-vectors">
<h2>Unit vectors<a href="#unit-vectors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A vector with <strong>magnitude</strong> of <code><span>1</span></code> is called a <strong>unit vector</strong>. They are also
sometimes referred to as <strong>direction vectors</strong> or <strong>normals</strong>. Unit vectors are
helpful when you need to keep track of a direction.</p>
<section id="normalization">
<h3>Normalization<a href="#normalization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Normalizing</strong> a vector means reducing its length to <code><span>1</span></code> while preserving its
direction. This is done by dividing each of its components by its magnitude.
Because this is such a common operation, Godot provides a dedicated
<a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2.html#class-vector2-method-normalized"><span>normalized()</span></a> method for this:</p>

<div>
<p>Warning</p>
<p>Because normalization involves dividing by the vector's length, you
cannot normalize a vector of length <code><span>0</span></code>. Attempting to do so
would normally result in an error. In GDScript though, trying to
call the <code><span>normalized()</span></code> method on a vector of length 0 leaves the
value untouched and avoids the error for you.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="reflection">
<h3>Reflection<a href="#reflection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A common use of unit vectors is to indicate <strong>normals</strong>. Normal vectors are unit
vectors aligned perpendicularly to a surface, defining its direction. They are
commonly used for lighting, collisions, and other operations involving surfaces.</p>
<p>For example, imagine we have a moving ball that we want to bounce off a wall or
other object:</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_reflect1.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_reflect1.png">
<p>The surface normal has a value of <code><span>(0,</span> <span>-1)</span></code> because this is a horizontal
surface. When the ball collides, we take its remaining motion (the amount left
over when it hits the surface) and reflect it using the normal. In Godot, there
is a <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2.html#class-vector2-method-bounce"><span>bounce()</span></a> method to handle this.
Here is a code example of the above diagram using a <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_characterbody2d.html#class-characterbody2d"><span>CharacterBody2D</span></a>:</p>
<div aria-labelledby="tab-5-R0RTY3JpcHQ=" id="panel-5-R0RTY3JpcHQ=" name="R0RTY3JpcHQ=" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0"><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>collision</span><span>:</span> <span>KinematicCollision2D</span> <span>=</span> <span>move_and_collide</span><span>(</span><span>velocity</span> <span>*</span> <span>delta</span><span>)</span>

</pre></div>
</section>
</section>
<section id="dot-product">
<h2>Dot product<a href="#dot-product" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>dot product</strong> is one of the most important concepts in vector math, but is
often misunderstood. Dot product is an operation on two vectors that returns a
<strong>scalar</strong>. Unlike a vector, which contains both magnitude and direction, a
scalar value has only magnitude.</p>
<p>The formula for dot product takes two common forms:</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_dot1.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_dot1.png">
<p>and</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_dot2.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_dot2.png">
<p>The mathematical notation <em>||A||</em> represents the magnitude of vector <code><span>A</span></code>, and
<em>A</em><sub>x</sub> means the <code><span>x</span></code> component of vector <code><span>A</span></code>.</p>
<p>However, in most cases it is easiest to use the built-in <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2.html#class-vector2-method-dot"><span>dot()</span></a> method. Note that the order of the two vectors does not matter:</p>
<div aria-labelledby="tab-6-R0RTY3JpcHQ=" id="panel-6-R0RTY3JpcHQ=" name="R0RTY3JpcHQ=" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0"><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>dot</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>dot</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>  <span># These are equivalent.</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The dot product is most useful when used with unit vectors, making the first
formula reduce to just <code><span>cos(θ)</span></code>. This means we can use the dot product to tell
us something about the angle between two vectors:</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_dot3.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_dot3.png">
<p>When using unit vectors, the result will always be between <code><span>-1</span></code> (180°) and
<code><span>1</span></code> (0°).</p>
<section id="facing">
<h3>Facing<a href="#facing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We can use this fact to detect whether an object is facing toward another
object. In the diagram below, the player <code><span>P</span></code> is trying to avoid the zombies
<code><span>A</span></code> and <code><span>B</span></code>. Assuming a zombie's field of view is <strong>180°</strong>, can they see the
player?</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_facing2.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_facing2.png">
<p>The green arrows <code><span>fA</span></code> and <code><span>fB</span></code> are <strong>unit vectors</strong> representing the
zombie's facing direction and the blue semicircle represents its field of view.
For zombie <code><span>A</span></code>, we find the direction vector <code><span>AP</span></code> pointing to the player
using <code><span>P</span> <span>-</span> <span>A</span></code> and normalize it, however, Godot has a helper method to do this
called <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2.html#class-vector2-method-direction-to"><span>direction_to()</span></a>. If the angle
between this vector and the facing vector is less than 90°, then the zombie can
see the player.</p>
<p>In code it would look like this:</p>
<div aria-labelledby="tab-7-R0RTY3JpcHQ=" id="panel-7-R0RTY3JpcHQ=" name="R0RTY3JpcHQ=" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0"><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>AP</span> <span>=</span> <span>A</span><span>.</span><span>direction_to</span><span>(</span><span>P</span><span>)</span>

<section id="cross-product">
<h2>Cross product<a href="#cross-product" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Like the dot product, the <strong>cross product</strong> is an operation on two vectors.
However, the result of the cross product is a vector with a direction that is
perpendicular to both. Its magnitude depends on their relative angle. If two
vectors are parallel, the result of their cross product will be a null vector.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_cross1.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_cross1.png">

</pre></div>
<p>With Godot, you can use the built-in <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector3.html#class-vector3-method-cross"><span>Vector3.cross()</span></a>
method:</p>

<p>The cross product is not mathematically defined in 2D. The <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2.html#class-vector2-method-cross"><span>Vector2.cross()</span></a> method is a commonly used analog of the 3D cross
product for 2D vectors.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>In the cross product, order matters. <code><span>a.cross(b)</span></code> does not give the
same result as <code><span>b.cross(a)</span></code>. The resulting vectors point in
<strong>opposite</strong> directions.</p>
</div>
<section id="calculating-normals">
<h3>Calculating normals<a href="#calculating-normals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One common use of cross products is to find the surface normal of a plane or
surface in 3D space. If we have the triangle <code><span>ABC</span></code> we can use vector
subtraction to find two edges <code><span>AB</span></code> and <code><span>AC</span></code>. Using the cross product,

between two vectors. However, in 3D, this is not enough information. We also
need to know what axis to rotate around. We can find that by calculating the
cross product of the current facing direction and the target direction. The
resulting perpendicular vector is the axis of rotation.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>When the marital infidelity website <strong>AshleyMadison.com</strong> learned in July 2015 that hackers were threatening to publish data stolen from 37 million users, the company’s then-CEO <strong>Noel Biderman</strong> was quick to point the finger at an unnamed former contractor. But as a new documentary series on <strong>Hulu</strong> reveals [<em>SPOILER ALERT!</em>], there was just one problem with that theory: Their top suspect had killed himself more than a year before the hackers began publishing stolen user data.</p>
<p>The new documentary, <em>The Ashley Madison Affair</em>, begins airing today on Hulu in the United States and on <strong>Disney+</strong> in the United Kingdom. The series features interviews with security experts and journalists, Ashley Madison executives, victims of the breach and jilted spouses.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/amaffair.png" alt="" width="749" height="515" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/amaffair.png 1088w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/amaffair-768x528.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/amaffair-782x538.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/amaffair-100x70.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></p>
<p>The series also touches on shocking new details unearthed by KrebsOnSecurity and <strong>Jeremy Bullock</strong>, a data scientist who worked with the show’s producers at the Warner Bros. production company Wall to Wall Media. Bullock had spent many hours poring over the hundreds of thousands of emails that the Ashley Madison hackers stole from Biderman and published online in 2015.</p>
<p>Wall to Wall reached out in July 2022 about collaborating with Bullock after KrebsOnSecurity published <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/07/a-retrospective-on-the-2015-ashley-madison-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Retrospective on the 2015 Ashley Madison Breach</a>. That piece explored how Biderman — who is Jewish — had become the target of concerted harassment campaigns by anti-Semitic and far-right groups online in the months leading up to the hack.</p>
<p>Whoever hacked Ashley Madison had access to all employee emails, but they only released Biderman’s messages — three years worth. Apropos of my retrospective report, Bullock found that a great many messages in Biderman’s inbox were belligerent and anti-Semitic screeds from a former Ashley Madison employee named <strong>William Brewster Harrison</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_64160"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-64160" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/willhired.png" alt="" width="622" height="726"></p><p id="caption-attachment-64160">William Harrison’s employment contract with Ashley Madison parent Avid Life Media.</p></div>
<p>The messages show that Harrison was hired in March 2010 to help promote Ashley Madison online, but the messages also reveal Harrison was heavily involved in helping to create and cultivate phony female accounts on the service.</p>
<p>There is evidence to suggest that in 2010 Harrison was directed to harass the owner of <strong>Ashleymadisonsucks.com </strong>into closing the site or selling the domain to Ashley Madison.</p>
<p>Ashley Madison’s parent company — Toronto-based <strong>Avid Life Media</strong> — filed a trademark infringement complaint in 2010 that succeeded in revealing a man named <strong>Dennis Bradshaw</strong> as the owner. But after being informed that Bradshaw was not subject to Canadian trademark laws, Avid Life offered to buy AshleyMadisonSucks.com for $10,000.</p>
<p>When Bradshaw refused to sell the domain, he and his then-girlfriend were subject to an unrelenting campaign of online harassment and blackmail. It now appears those attacks were perpetrated by Harrison, who sent emails from different accounts at the free email service <strong>Vistomail</strong> pretending to be Bradshaw, his then-girlfriend and their friends.</p>
<p>[As the documentary points out, the domain AshleyMadisonSucks.com was eventually transferred to Ashley Madison, which then shrewdly used it for advertising and to help debunk theories about why its service was supposedly untrustworthy].<span id="more-63941"></span></p>
<p>Harrison even went after Bradshaw’s lawyer and wife, listing them both on a website he created called <strong>Contact-a-CEO[.]com</strong>, which Harrison used to besmirch the name of major companies — including several past employers — all entities he believed had slighted him or his family in some way. The site also claimed to include the names, addresses and phone numbers of top CEOs.</p>
<div id="attachment_64163"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-64163" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/contactaceo.png" alt="" width="696" height="627"></p><p id="caption-attachment-64163">A cached copy of Harrison’s website, contact-the-ceo.com.</p></div>
<p>An exhaustive analysis of domains registered to the various Vistomail pseudonyms used by Harrison shows he also ran <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090203030040/http://www.bash-a-business.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Bash-a-Business[.]com</strong></a>, which Harrison dedicated to “all those sorry ass corporate executives out there profiting from your hard work, organs, lives, ideas, intelligence, and wallets.” Copies of the site at archive.org show it was the work of someone calling themselves “<strong>The Chaos Creator</strong>.”</p>
<p>Will Harrison was terminated as an Ashley Madison employee in November 2011, and by early 2012 he’d turned his considerable harassment skills squarely against the company. Ashley Madison’s long-suspected army of fake female accounts came to the fore in August 2012 after the former sex worker turned activist and blogger <strong>Maggie McNeill</strong> <a href="https://maggiemcneill.com/2012/08/15/show-and-tell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published screenshots</a> apparently taken from Ashley Madison’s internal systems suggesting that a large percentage of the female accounts on the service were computer-operated bots.</p>
<p>Ashley Madison’s executives understood that only a handful of employees at the time would have had access to the systems needed to produce the screenshots McNeill published online. In one exchange on Aug. 16, 2012, Ashley Madison’s director of IT was asked to produce a list of all company employees with all-powerful administrator access.</p>
<p>“Who or what is <strong>asdfdfsda@asdf.com</strong>?,” Biderman asked, after being sent a list of nine email addresses.</p>
<p>“It appears to be the email address Will used for his profiles,” the IT director replied.</p>
<p>“And his access was never shut off until today?,” asked the company’s general counsel Mike Dacks.</p>
<div id="attachment_64165"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-64165" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/alm-users.png" alt="" width="772" height="726" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/alm-users.png 772w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/alm-users-768x722.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-64165">A Biderman email from 2012.</p></div>
<p>What prompted the data scientist Bullock to reach out were gobs of anti-Semitic diatribes from Harrison, who had taken to labeling Biderman and others “greedy Jew bastards.”</p>
<p>“So good luck, I’m sure we’ll talk again soon, but for now, Ive got better things in the oven,” Harrison wrote to Biderman after his employment contract with Ashley Madison was terminated. “Just remember I outsmarted you last time and I will outsmart and out maneuver you this time too, by keeping myself far far away from the action and just enjoying the sideline view, cheering for the opposition.”</p>
<div id="attachment_64162"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-64162" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/noelbuddy.png" alt="" width="608" height="539"></p><p id="caption-attachment-64162">A 2012 email from William Harrison to former Ashley Madison CEO Noel Biderman.</p></div>
<p>Harrison signed his threatening missive with the salutation, “We are legion,” suggesting that whatever comeuppance he had in store for Ashley Madison would come from a variety of directions and anonymous hackers.</p>
<p>The leaked Biderman emails show that Harrison made good on his threats, and that in the months that followed Harrison began targeting Biderman and other Ashley Madison executives with menacing anonymous emails and spoofed phone calls laced with profanity and anti-Semitic language.</p>
<p>But on Mar. 5, 2014, Harrison committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with a handgun. This fact was apparently unknown to Biderman and other Ashley Madison executives more than a year later when their July 2015 hack was first revealed.</p>
<p>Does Harrison’s untimely suicide rule him out as a suspect in the 2015 hack? Who is The Chaos Creator, and what else transpired between Harrison and Ashley Madison prior to his death? We’ll explore these questions in Part II of this story, to be published early next week.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Let's pretend I've decided to build a spice rack.</p>
      <p>I've done small woodworking projects before, and I think I have a pretty good idea of what I need: some wood and a few basic tools: a tape measure, a saw, a level, and a hammer.</p>
      <p>If I were going to build a whole house, rather than just a spice rack, I'd still need a tape measure, a saw, a level, and a hammer (among other things).</p>
      <p>So I go to the hardware store to buy the tools, and I ask the sales clerk where I can find a hammer.</p>
      <p>"A hammer?" he asks. "Nobody really buys hammers anymore. They're kind of old fashioned."</p>
      <p>Surprised at this development, I ask him why.</p>
      <p>"Well, the problem with hammers is that there are so many different kinds. Sledge hammers, claw hammers, ball-peen hammers. What if you bought one kind of hammer and then realized that you needed a different kind of hammer later? You'd have to buy a separate hammer for your next task. As it turns out, most people really want a single hammer that can handle all of the different kinds of hammering tasks you might encounter in your life."</p>
      <p>"Hmmmmmm. Well, I suppose that sounds all right. Can you show me where to find a Universal Hammer."</p>
      <p>"No, we don't sell those anymore. They're pretty obsolete."</p>
      <p>"Really? I thought you just said that the Universal Hammer was the wave of the future."</p>
      <p>"As it turns out, if you make only one kind of hammer, capable of performing all the same tasks as all those different kinds of hammers, then it isn't very good at any of them. Driving a nail with a sledgehammer isn't very effective. And, if you want to kill someone, there's really no substitute for a ball-peen hammer."</p>
      <p>"That's true. So, if nobody buys Universal Hammers anymore, and if you're no longer selling all those old-fashioned kinds of hammers, what kinds of hammers do you sell?"</p>
      <p>"Actually, we don't sell hammers at all."</p>
      <p>"So..."</p>
      <p>"According to our research, what people really needed wasn't a Universal Hammer after all. It's always better to have the right kind of hammer for the job. So, we started selling hammer factories, capable of producing whatever kind of hammers you might be interested in using. All you need to do is staff the hammer factory with workers, activate the machinery, buy the raw materials, pay the utility bills, and PRESTO...you'll have exactly the kind of hammer you need in no time flat."</p>
      <p>"But I don't really want to buy a hammer factory..."</p>
      <p>"That's good. Because we don't sell them anymore."</p>
      <p>"But I thought you just said..."</p>
      <p>"We discovered that most people don't actually need an entire hammer factory. Some people, for example, will never need a ball-peen hammer. (Maybe they've never had to kill someone. Or maybe they killed them with icepicks instead.) So there's no point in someone buying a hammer factory that can produce every kind of hammer under the sun."</p>
      <p>"Yeah, that makes a lot of sense."</p>
      <p>"So, instead, we started selling schematic diagrams for hammer factories, enabling our clients to build their own hammer factories, custom engineered to manufacture only the kinds of hammers that they would actually need."</p>
      <p>"Let me guess. You don't sell those anymore."</p>
      <p>"Nope. Sure don't. As it turns out, people don't want to build an entire factory just to manufacture a couple of hammers. Leave the factory-building up to the factory-building experts, that's what I always say!!"</p>
      <p>"And I would agree with you there."</p>
      <p>"Yup. So we stopped selling those schematics and started selling hammer-factory-building factories. Each hammer factory factory is built for you by the top experts in the hammer factory factory business, so you don't need to worry about all the details that go into building a factory. Yet you still get all the benefits of having your own customized hammer factory, churning out your own customized hammers, according to your own specific hammer designs."</p>
      <p>"Well, that doesn't really..."</p>
      <p>"I know what you're going to say!! ...and we don't sell those anymore either. For some reason, not many people were buying the hammer factory factories, so we came up with a new solution to address the problem."</p>
      <p>"Uh huh."</p>
      <p>"When we stepped back and looked at the global tool infrastructure, we determined that people were frustrated with having to manage and operate a hammer factory factory, as well as the hammer factory that it produced. That kind of overhead can get pretty cumbersome when you deal with the likely scenario of also operating a tape measure factory factory, a saw factory factory, and a level factory factory, not to mention a lumber manufacturing conglomerate holding company. When we really looked at the situation, we determined that that's just too complex for someone who really just wants to build a spice rack."</p>
      <p>"Yeah, no kidding."</p>
      <p>"So this week, we're introducing a general-purpose tool-building factory factory factory, so that all of your different tool factory factories can be produced by a single, unified factory. The factory factory factory will produce only the tool factory factories that you actually need, and each of those factory factories will produce a single factory based on your custom tool specifications. The final set of tools that emerge from this process will be the ideal tools for your particular project. You'll have exactly the hammer you need, and exactly the right tape measure for your task, all at the press of a button (though you may also have to deploy a few configuration files to make it all work according to your expectations)."</p>
      <p>"So you don't have any hammers? None at all?"</p>
      <p>"No. If you really want a high-quality, industrially engineered spice rack, you desperately need something more advanced than a simple hammer from a rinky-dink hardware store."</p>
      <p>"And this is the way everyone is doing it now? Everyone is using a general-purpose tool-building factory factory factory now, whenever they need a hammer?"</p>
      <p>"Yes."</p>
      <p>"Well all right. I guess that's what I'll have to do. If this is the way things are done now, I guess I'd better learn how to do it."</p>
      <p>"Good for you!!"</p>
      <p>"This thing comes with documentation, right?"</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>‘Eutychis, a Greek lass with sweet ways, <span>2 asses.’</span> This pithy graffito advertising sex for sale comes from the walls of Pompeii. The ancient Roman city was already an old town when it was destroyed in the <a href="https://aeon.co/videos/from-eruption-to-obliteration-the-sights-and-sounds-of-48-fateful-hours-in-pompeii" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eruption</a> of Mount Vesuvius in <span>August 79 CE</span> – and thus preserved for posterity. Located on the Bay of Naples, near the mouth of the river Sarno, there are early signs of Etruscan culture, though the area was later settled by Oscan-speaking Samnites, who began the town’s real growth after around <span>200 BCE.</span> The land around Pompeii was fertile, and the city and region grew wealthy.</p>
<figure><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/2599/insert-Eutychis-graffito-FwJ2W-IX0AEtokP.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption><p>‘Eutychis, a Greek lass with sweet ways, 2 asses’; grafitto at the entrance to the Lupanar, Pompeii. <a href="http://pompeiisites.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Photo courtesy Pompeii Sites</a></p></figcaption></figure>
<p>As Rome expanded its power throughout Italy, Pompeii became a Roman city, though one that retained a diverse population. We can imagine a busy place of some 12,000 people, rich and poor, free and enslaved, of public squares, fountains and gardens, fine houses and poorer dwellings, taverns, shops and workshops, and a stone amphitheatre for the provision of large-scale public entertainment. There would have been a clamour of Oscan, Greek and Latin, and all the activities we would expect from a thriving town – politics, business, love, crime.</p>
<p>Graffiti is one of the most exciting kinds of evidence preserved for us by the destruction of Pompeii, because it comes not from the literature of the elite, or the inscriptions of the powerful, but from a wider cross-section of society. The Eutychis graffito gives us a woman’s name, an ethnicity, a price, the hint of a good time to be had – and suggests a seamy side to the ruined town now frequented by inquisitive tourists and keen culture-vultures. It was written on the vestibule wall of a well-to-do house owned by two freedmen, the Vettii, which is perhaps best known to the world for its painting of the well-endowed Priapus weighing his member on a balance against a bag of coins. While brief and to the point, this announcement, calling out to us from nearly <span>2,000 years</span> ago, can set us on a journey to understanding more about the life of Pompeii’s haves and have-nots. At the same time, it may well leave us with more questions than answers about Eutychis herself and the prostitutes of Pompeii.</p>
<figure><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/2600/insert-The_so-called_brothel_at_Pompeii,_three-quarter_view._Photog_Wellcome_V0038959.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption><p>The Lupanar brothel, Pompeii. Photo courtesy Wellcome Images</p></figcaption></figure>
<p><span>P</span>ompeii, often seen under the bright sun with hordes of other visitors, does not hide its darker side – in fact, the single purpose-built <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/brothel-of-pompeii/30A33063D0317A93E86D821FCDF86A79" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brothel</a> identified in the city, known as the Lupanar, is one of its most popular attractions. The sexy frescoes are one highlight. Eight can be seen above the doorways of the little cubicles with their masonry ‘beds’. Five or six are female-male sex scenes, another shows a woman standing next to a reclining man as she points at an erotic picture, and the last depicts the god Priapus with two erect phalluses. These show something very basic and timeless that we have in common with ancient Pompeiians – sex – but they also titillate the visitor and sometimes prompt dirty jokes from both guides and visitors. The frescoes presumably indicate the kind of activities that were available to customers, and helped in creating an erotically charged atmosphere.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Thanks to the graffiti in the brothel, we even know the names of some of the women who worked there: Anedia, Aplonia, Atthis, Beronice, Cadia, Cressa, Drauca, Fabia, Faustilla, Felicla, Fortunata, Habenda, Helpis, Ianuaria, Ias, Mola, Murtis, Myrtale, Mysis, Nais, Panta, Restituta, Rusatia, Scepsis, Victoria, and the daughter of Salvius. Eutychis does not appear in the list, although it might well be that those were working names; some of them appear in graffiti elsewhere in town.</p>
<p>They were on display naked with prices, to be perused, evaluated and chosen by the male clientele</p>
<p>How would Pompeiians and other visitors have experienced the brothel? We can learn something of this from a fragmentary literary text called <em>The Satyricon</em>, written in the <span>1st century CE</span> by an elite Roman called Petronius. In the scene, the male character Encolpius has become lost in town. An old woman tricks him into entering the brothel, whereupon:</p>
<blockquote>I noticed some men and naked women walking cautiously about among placards of price. Too late, too late I realised that I had been taken into a bawdy-house. I cursed the cunning old woman, and covered my head, and began to run through the brothel to another part, when just at the entrance Ascyltos met me, as tired as I was, and half-dead. It looked as though the same old lady had brought him there. I hailed him with a laugh, and asked him what he was doing in such an unpleasant spot.</blockquote>
<blockquote>He mopped himself with his hands and said: ‘If you only knew what has happened to me.’ ‘What is it?’ I said. ‘Well,’ he said, on the point of fainting, ‘I was wandering all over the town without finding where I had left my lodgings, when a respectable person came up to me and very kindly offered to direct me. He took me round a number of dark turnings and brought me out here, and then began to offer me money and solicit me. A woman got threepence out of me for a room, and he had already seized me. The worst would have happened if I had not been stronger <span>than he.’</span> </blockquote>
<p>Petronius was writing comedy, but there is no reason to dispute the incidental details, which can bring the Lupanar to life. His description suggests brothels would be located in more out-of-the-way parts of town and were not necessarily identifiable from the outside; the prostitutes and punters were screened from the outside world by a curtain. It also reveals that people could be enticed or tricked into visiting – presumably chaperones who drummed up trade got a fee. The prostitutes themselves were on display naked with prices, to be perused, evaluated and chosen by the male clientele. Cubicles or rooms could be rented out for <span>private use.</span></p>
<p><span>T</span>he Roman poet Horace wrote about men’s choice of sexual partners in one of his satires, where he is pointing out the follies of some men – especially in hankering after or having affairs with elite or married women. He suggests that prostitutes are a much more sensible choice when a man had need of sex. For one thing, their faces and bodies are visible, he says. In contrast to respectable women, whose bodies were well covered, prostitutes’ clothes could be revealing, allowing the man to view what he might want to buy and use. And, during the encounter, Horace says, a man might call the prostitute by any name – she could be expected to cater better to man’s fantasies. Horace, at least in character, preferred these women to be fair and natural, smartly turned out, prompt and inexpensive.</p>
<p><em>The</em> <em>Satyricon</em> begins to fill in the details of the lives and environment of some prostitutes – those who worked in brothels, at least – but, so far, from the text and the paintings we have something of a light-hearted view of what went on. However, the reality of the women in the brothel, naked and carrying their price placards, was a grim one: their bodies put to use for the profit of the brothel’s owners, their physical and emotional work performed in tiny open cubicles or sex booths. Most of them were slaves, who had little choice in what they were doing, at the mercy of their owners and customers. Poorer free women too were vulnerable and had probably been driven to prostitution by <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/LEWTML" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">necessity</a>. About a fifth of the women’s names in the brothel indicate they were free.</p>
<p>Slavery was an accepted institution in the Roman Empire, and slaves of all kinds – agricultural workers, urban house slaves, labourers, miners, teachers (and prostitutes) – were everywhere. Some few slaves may have lived relatively privileged lives, and others had a degree of independence in their work and life, within the confines of being owned; some could even hope to be made free. But there are also sombre reminders of the less fortunate. Columella, also writing in the <span>1st century CE,</span> explained how slaves on the farm should be treated and managed. He recommended their constant supervision and physical restraint in chains and in slave prisons (<em>ergastula</em>), as well as keeping control over where they could go, whom they could see, and also their bathing, religious practices and sex. What was the regime like for slave prostitutes in the Lupanar?</p>
<p>Slaves often had no space of their own but were simply part of the furniture</p>
<p>Enslaved people <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-world-history-of-slavery/slavery-under-the-principate/647C25DFE34A68277B2A467E20842DF2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might be</a> denied a love or sex life of their own but also be forced to reproduce (a source of new slaves), while female slaves might be forced into sex to help control male slaves. Sexual abuse and rape by owners was one particular vulnerability of slaves, female and male, child and adult. Many slaves could expect to be used sexually by their owners as a matter of course, perhaps household slaves in particular given their proximity. In another satire, Horace gives the line: ‘When your organ is stiff, and a servant girl or a young boy from the household is near at hand and you know you can make an immediate assault, would you sooner burst with tension?’ He also wrote an ode on the topic, advising his friend not to be ashamed of loving his slave when Achilles and other heroes did the same. A gold armband from Pompeii hints at this kind of relationship; it carries the legend ‘from the master to his slave girl’. Yet as well as perhaps being an earnest gift, it was also a reminder of who was who in the relationship. Sometimes, slaves may have been able to leverage sex to their advantage.</p>
<p>Archaeology furnishes more tangible evidence of the life of the enslaved. The relative absence of slave quarters in elite houses suggests that slaves often had no space of their own but were simply part of the furniture. They may have hidden and slept where they could, including making use of the spaces under staircases and dark and unpleasant cellars. These cellars could have other uses too. At Pompeii, in the Villa of the Mosaic Columns, the skeleton of a slave was found in a cellar with iron shackles anchored into the ground. This seems to have been a slave prison. Leg irons were <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203866191-47/lives-slaves-michele-george" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found</a> in a cupboard in the House of the Venus in Bikini, perhaps a half-hidden but lingering threat to coerce slaves into good behaviour. Beatings and whippings and the threat of <a href="https://www.press.umich.edu/8769247/topography_of_violence_in_the_greco_roman_world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">violence</a> were commonplace means of control and punishment by <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/were-roman-slaveowners-the-first-management-theorists" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slaveowners</a>. There was not only the physical <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/patriarchy-property-and-death-in-the-roman-family/whips-and-words-discipline-and-punishment-in-the-roman-household/CB53D2255044004F8C86F3DF72F9D649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pain</a> involved, but also the humiliation of such a personal affront, which the victim was powerless to prevent. Compulsion and coercion were enforced psychologically as well as physically. Perhaps the Lupanar had its own ‘bouncers’, ready to deal with any trouble from customers or from the women themselves.</p>
<p>Enslaved people did resist and some did manage to run away. One nameless slave from Bulla Regia, in north Africa, was put in a lead collar inscribed: ‘This is a cheating whore! Seize her because she escaped from Bulla Regia.’ The collar was found with a skeleton in the Temple of Apollo. Nobody knows the name of the woman who wore it. Did she die seeking shelter in the abandoned temple? Was this her first attempt to flee or had she tried before and then been collared? This woman is almost lost in history, unknown apart from the symbol of her captivity.</p>

<p>There are some 45 <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.3764/aja.120.3.0447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">known</a> slave collars. Many mention the name, occupation and location of the slave’s owner, but never the slave. For example, a bronze tag from a slave collar from Rome announced: ‘Hold me because I have run away and return me to the Caelimontium to the house of Elpidius, <em>vir clarissimus</em>, to Bonosus.’ Its other side said: ‘Hold me and return me to the Forum of Mars, to Maximianus the antiquary.’ It seems the tag had been reused. An iron collar from Rome also offers a reward: ‘I have run away; hold me. When you have brought me back to my master Zoninus, you will receive a gold coin.’</p>
<p><span>S</span>o who was Eutychis? Was she a prostitute, an enslaved woman, both or neither? Was she forced into selling herself? Let us think first of her name. Eutychis is a Greek name that roughly translates to ‘fortunate’, and was in use throughout the Greek-speaking world. Although the graffito surely refers to a real person, we don’t know whether it was her real name, or a slave name, or a working name. If she was a free woman working as a prostitute, she may have chosen Eutychis as her pseudonym; if she was a slave, the name may have been given to her by her owner. Renaming a slave with something cheerful and Greek was a common <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-world-history-of-slavery/roman-slave-supply/F42FF85C3DF0587EF1E1375C25B0359E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">practice</a> of the Romans.</p>
<p>This act of renaming an enslaved person could affect them in various ways. It robbed the enslaved person of a key aspect of their own identity and replaced it with a sometimes cruel name that emphasised their status as property. A slave prostitute named ‘fortunate’ or ‘lucky’ was probably anything but. Another slave in the House of the Vettii was called ‘Eros’ (‘desire’). The graffito that mentions him reads: ‘Eros likes to be sexually passive,’ but it was later scratched out<strong>)</strong>. Nowadays, we might see this as an aspect of coercive control, an ongoing rite of abuse and humiliation. However, renaming could also allow the enslaved person to retain a separate, inner ‘core’ identity linked with their own ‘private’ name. An unhappy possibility is that we know ‘Eutychis’ only by the name her owner gave her, and she remains, in this sense, <a href="https://profilebooks.com/work/invisible-romans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">invisible</a>.</p>
<p>The second part of the graffito stresses Eutychis’ Greekness. Should we read the label of ‘Greek’ simply as a statement of fact, or could it have a different significance? If the graffito were written by her owner or a pimp, then it could be that both the name and the ethnic label were given to increase Eutychis’ appeal by generating a sense of exoticism – although Pompeii had quite a mixed heritage and attracted all kinds of visitors. Were Greek women fetishised as sex objects by some Pompeiian males? The fetishisation and sexualisation of groups of women (and men), based on ethnicity or race, is well known still, so it is not impossible.</p>
<p>A prostitute would have had to appear cheerful, coy or aroused, depending on the circumstances</p>
<p>On the other hand, perhaps ‘a Greek lass’ would have appealed to Greeks travelling through the town or Greek-heritage Pompeiians, such as Mousaios or Epagathus, named in graffiti from the Lupanar, or Pyrrhus or Chius, <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781315744155/graffiti-antiquity-peter-keegan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">known</a> in graffiti from the Basilica at Pompeii. Mousaios’ name was written in Greek rather than Latin, one of a number of Greek graffiti found around the city. Either way, the choice and statement of both her name and ethnicity could have been deliberate business strategies rather than factual biographical details.</p>
<p>The advert also stresses Eutychis’ ‘sweet ways’ (<em>moribus bellis</em>)<em>.</em> This is found on a number of graffiti in Pompeii. In the Lupanar, we find ‘Restitua with sweet ways’. Other prostitutes, such as Spes, Successa, and Menander, a man, are so labelled. This label suggests a good time in an indirect fashion, perhaps good company as well as a sexual service. Indeed, Sarah Levin-Richardson <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.7560/765610-011/html?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reminds</a> us that prostitution could also involve emotional as well as physical labour. A prostitute would likely have had to run the gamut of emotions, appearing cheerful, coy or aroused, enticing and passionate, pliable or dominant, depending on the circumstances. This contrasts with some of the other graffiti around the town that elaborates on the specific services offered, especially fellatio <span>and sex.</span></p>
<p>Finally, what of the price of two <em>asses </em>(copper coins)? It seems low; the same price as a loaf of bread. Recorded prices for prostitutes varied, but most tend to be from one to five <em>asses</em>. Two <em>asses</em> seems to have been a common price at Pompeii and may have been a kind of standard low rate. Price could reflect a number of factors. It would be calculated to attract a high volume of customers, or it may reflect the age and perceived appeal of the woman. It could have been used as a punishment. Perhaps there was an element of haggling possible once a punter had expressed an interest. Independent prostitutes may have had little means to protect themselves and enforce payment.</p>
<p>We should also consider what the location of the graffito adds to the story. The text was written on the left wall of the vestibule of the House of the Vettii. The Vettii are usually thought of as brothers, Aulus Vettius Conviva and Aulus Vettius Restitutus, who were freed slaves who took on the name of their former master, Aulus Vettius. Their names were on bronze seals found near a large wooden strongbox in the house, along with a ring with the initials ‘AVC’. In graffiti on the outside of the house, Conviva is named as an <em>Augustalis</em>, a priestly position open to former slaves, while Restitutus urges voters to support one Sabinus. Whether they were brothers, father and son, friends or coworkers can’t really be known, but they seem to have had some wealth and privilege, including their well-decorated town house. The Priapus painting emphasises the Vettii’s wealth, as Priapus was a god of fertility – besides the member and the money, the painting shows his basket of fruit on the ground. Two of the ‘funny’ stories associated with him, related by the poet Ovid, have him failing to rape the goddess Hestia and a nymph called Lotis.</p>

<p>The other paintings in the House of the Vettii may tell us more about the life of the house and its inhabitants, and shed light on Eutychis. One careful <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0424.2012.01697.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">analysis</a> by Beth Severy-Hoven focuses in particular on the sets of paintings found in a pair of reception rooms, called ‘<em>n</em>’ and ‘<em>p</em>’. The rooms and their decorative scheme seem to mirror each other. Room <em>n</em> has two violent paintings. On the back wall is a depiction of the punishment of Pentheus, who was killed by the female worshippers of Dionysus. The naked Pentheus is falling, arms spread wide as the women attack him from all sides. On the wall on the right, the punishment of Dirce is shown. She is tied, naked, under a bull to be trampled to death, a fate she had planned for another woman, Antiope.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Room <em>p</em> shows the punishment of Ixion at the back, who was tied to a fiery wheel for eternity for trying to rape Hera, and the punishment of Pasiphae, made (for her husband’s crimes) to lust after a bull, on the left. Each room, then, shows the torture of a female and a male character from mythology. Those in room <em>n</em> were punished by humans, and those in <em>p</em> by the gods.</p>
<p>Severy-Hoven argues that we can read the decoration from the perspective of the Vettii being freed slaves and from a perspective of power. As we already noted, enslaved people were there to be used sexually and were likely to be punished in numerous ways, which may have been something the Vettii themselves experienced. The Vettii’s choice of these images of punisher and punished to decorate their public dining rooms would call to mind the distinction between master and slave – both for themselves and for their slaves. As Severy-Hoven puts it: ‘When the owner selected these images of eroticised torture, he was inscribing his own power to punish or to enjoy onto his very walls.’</p>
<p><span>W</span>as Eutychis a house-slave of the Vettii? It is possible. One clue from that graffito itself is that it may first have read ‘verna’ rather than ‘Graeca’ – that is ‘homeborn slave’ rather than ‘Greek lass’. If she was, it is not unlikely that she would have been a target of sexual advances by the Vettii and their friends. Did the Vettii also pimp out their house slave Eutychis? One ancient novel, <em>The Golden Ass</em> by Apuleius, tells of a young woman called Charite, who has been kidnapped by bandits. When she is caught trying to escape, one of the bandits suggests selling her to a brothel or to pimps in a nearby town. As he says to the bandits, ‘seeing her servicing men in a whorehouse will be sweet revenge for you’. Sex in various ways could be a punishment. Daily life as a slave in the House of the Vettii may have been a constant fight to remain unmolested and unpunished, a fight to retain a degree of control and dignity.</p>
<p>The house may have been home to Eutychis, but it was no brothel like the Lupanar. However, one thing that has puzzled scholars about the House of the Vettii is the existence of a little room behind and only accessible from the kitchen, known as <em>x</em>1. This room is of interest because it is decorated with three large erotic paintings, yet it is hidden away in a service area. Was this the place where Eutychis had sex with customers, making more money on the side for the Vettii? It is possible, but such an activity might not have benefitted the owner’s public reputation. Or were the paintings a gift to a good cook or other slave, who had the use of the room? Alternatively, were they a reminder to the enslaved staff, who may have slept there, of their sexual availability and vulnerability and their lack of power in the house? Another <a href="https://www.press.umich.edu/2798142/economy_of_prostitution_in_the_roman_world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">idea</a> is that such rooms, of which there are perhaps six at Pompeii, were private ‘sex clubs’, rooms that conjured up the brothel atmosphere but were not open to the public. Perhaps Eutychis was required to serve her masters in this grim fantasy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, was the Eutychis graffito a real advert at all? We can’t rule out the possibility that it was simply a malicious daubing, in a way familiar from subway graffiti today. The Greek satirical writer Lucian, writing in his <em>Dialogues of the Courtesans</em> in the <span>2nd century CE,</span> mentioned that graffiti could be used as a joke, to mislead or to stir up trouble between lovers. Maybe Eutychis was a real Greek girl, perhaps even with sweet ways, but she need not have been a prostitute or even a slave. A rejected suitor or jilted lover might have written it in a place that she, and those who knew her, would see it. Perhaps this implies she did have some kind of connection with the House of the Vettii, but we cannot say for certain if she was a house-slave there.</p>
<p>The single graffito we began with has taken us on a journey through some of the darker aspects of life in Pompeii: the grittiness of the Lupanar, the ever-present threat for the enslaved of sexual assault and violence, being chained to the floor of a basement in pain and terror, being owned and being used. It is difficult to conjure these horrors while visiting the sun-baked town with its busloads of bright-shirted and good-natured tourists, or marvelling at the beautiful art and architecture in glossy books. We will never really know for sure about Eutychis, beyond the fact that there was a woman attached to the name. We may never know what life in the House of the Vettii was really like for its inhabitants, either. But we can keep trying to read the evidence to find the stories that bring the lives of Pompeii’s less fortunate into the light.</p></div></div>]]></description>
