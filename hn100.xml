    <p><em>This is not financial advice and I am not an expert.</em></p>
<p>Amazon has a stock problem.
It’s not only Amazon, but they have more to lose.
If you’re a customer, that’s going to be bad for your business too.</p>
<p>In 2023 Amazon laid off more than 27,000 people.
While that’s a big number it’s a deceptively small percentage for a company with more than 1.6 million employees (1.7%).</p>
<p>The vast majority of those layoffs happened in retail where a majority of Amazon’s employees work.
When layoffs <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit AWS</a>
 it was mostly areas that were not revenue generating or had lower margins.</p>
<p>But publicly laying off 27,000 isn’t good for business–at least not immediately.</p>
<p><img src="https://justingarrison.com/img/amazon-stock-graph-2023.jpg" alt="A graph of Amazon&amp;rsquo;s stock price"></p>
<p>The low stock at the beginning of the year is before the mass layoffs when operating expenses were high.
Then Andy <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/andy-jassy-update-on-amazon-return-to-office" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced return to office (RTO) initiatives</a>
, but nothing changed.</p>
<p>I was told repeatedly it wouldn’t affect me or the teams I worked with.
Then in the summer that changed.</p>
<p>The negative press associated with layoffs wasn’t good.
But the most effective way to reduce operational expenses was to get rid of all the expensive people.
How could they force people to leave without severance packages or en masse?
Making them miserable and silently sacking them.</p>
<p>So RTO was enforced.
And people started leaving in droves.
If they weren’t leaving they were looking, or at minimum waiting for their next RSU payout.</p>
<p>In my small sphere of people there wasn’t a single person under an L7 that didn’t want out.
From what I could gather this mostly came down to compensation.</p>
<p>Independent contributors (IC) and managers that are L7 or above generally make $400k-$800k and for that much money they’re willing to put up with some inconveniences.
Since Amazon’s pay is roughly 40% stock, they only make that much money so long as the stock stays up.</p>
<p>If Amazon keeps lowering their operating costs their earnings go up and stock rises.
At the cost of burning out everyone doing the work.</p>
<h2 id="welcome-to-day-2">Welcome to Day 2</h2>
<p>As customers are cutting their own costs, $1 spent on AWS is worth less than it was last year.
Every trend line still goes up and to the right, but growth is slowing.</p>
<p>Customers aren’t coming to the cloud for VMs and ludicrously expensive network anymore.
They want higher levels of abstraction that AWS has historically been terrible at delivering.</p>
<p>Couple that with <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/aws-degenerative-ai-blunder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon trailing in AI</a>
 and the most effective way Amazon can grow is by reducing costs.
The biggest cost is people.</p>
<p>Many teams at Amazon have been in a hiring freeze for over a year.
And now they’re chasing away the people they do have.</p>
<p>Amazon has shifted from a leader to a follower.
From my perspective it’s not going well.</p>
<p>Amazon hasn’t put in the decade of AI research Google has.
It doesn’t partner with external companies as good as Microsoft.
The high margin services AWS was built on (e.g. network egress) is being <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">given away for free</a>
 by compeditors.</p>
<p>Amazon is good at identifying real world problems they’ve faced from running an extremely large online store and logistics.
Generative AI hasn’t been a problem Amazon has identified needed to be fixed (or even deeply worked on) until it was costing them business deals.</p>
<h2 id="no-more-pizza-teams">No more pizza teams</h2>
<p>When I started at Amazon I was impressed that service teams were independent.
It was the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoPizzaTeam.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">purest implementation of devops</a>
 I had never seen before.
Especially at Amazon’s scale.</p>
<p>Then I realized how expensive it is.
There are only a handful of centralized teams at Amazon.
Those are almost all tools and compliance teams.</p>
<p>Pipelines, SDKs, and security are centralized.
All components of a service team are self-contained as part of that team.
It turns out that devops is a very expensive org chart.</p>
<p>Many of the service teams have lost a lot of institutional knowledge as part of RTO.
Teams were lean before 2023, now they’re emaciated.</p>
<p>Teams can’t keep innovating when they’re just trying to keep the lights on.
They can’t maintain on-call schedules without the ability to take vacation or sick days.</p>
<p>The next logical step to reduce costs is to centralize expertise.
It’s the reason many large companies have database administration, network engineering, or platform teams.</p>
<p>They’ll have to give up on autonomy to reduce duplication.
Amazon has never had a platform engineering team or site reliability engineers (SRE).
I suspect in 2024 they’ll start to reorg into a more centralized friendly org chart.</p>
<p>They won’t call the teams that because those titles come from Google, but they’ll effectively be the same.
They’ll centralize to create “better collaboration” but in reality it’ll be because they can’t lower margins enough to keep their earnings calls positive.</p>
<h2 id="outages-ahead">Outages ahead</h2>
<p>I suspect there’ll be a major AWS outage in 2024.
No amount of multi-region redundancy will protect you.</p>
<p>There has already been <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brucebawest_the-new-frequency-of-large-scale-events-at-activity-7109656617100484608-uGmJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an increase in large scale events (LSE) throughout Amazon</a>
, but AWS is so big most customers don’t notice.
This is a direct result of RTO and Amazon’s silent sacking of thousands of people.</p>
<p>Amazon isn’t incentivized to publicly share LSEs.
Only outages customers notice are worthy of a dashboard update, but even those are quickly swept under the “all greens” dashboard.</p>
<p>Amazon is an operationally strong company.
Much stronger than any company I’ve worked for before.</p>
<p>But those operational practices depend on people.
When people are eliminated to raise the stock price bar, operational practices suffer.</p>
<h2 id="amazon-wont-fire-me">Amazon won’t fire me</h2>
<p>On September 1st, 2023 I was told by my skip level manager and VP that my team and an adjacent team were being eliminated.
They claimed we all did such good work that they wanted us to remain at Amazon.
“We still have a job, just not a role.”</p>
<p>I was skeptical of how it was communicated–or rather not communicated–by management and I asked if severance was an option.
I was repeatedly told it would be once we’d exhausted other options.</p>
<p>They told us our number one priority was to find another job.
Every role we found had significant downsides.
Lower pay, lower title, RTO, or various other things.</p>
<p>It was clear they wanted us to take a different role we could quit later.
My management wanted to retain the headcount, but couldn’t do layoffs.</p>
<p>October 16th I asked my VP for the severance I was told would be available.
He let me know HR wasn’t aware of what he was doing and he would have to get approval.
It would take some time.</p>
<p>Every week for the next 2 1/2 months I asked for an update on my employment and severance package.
I was either ghosted or given a variety of excuses.
It’s now December 30th and I’m currently still employed by Amazon.</p>
<p>It hasn’t only been happening to my team.
This has been happening in multiple areas as Amazon silently sacks people without being required to give them severance or announce layoffs.
I’ve heard similar tactics being used at other companies–mostly large companies–and it’ll only continue in 2024 as they make decisions that drive short term profits over all else.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p itemprop="text">A recent judgement on copyright in the Court of Appeal (20 November) heralds the end of UK museums charging fees to reproduce historic artworks. In fact, it suggests museums have been mis-selling “image licences” for over a decade. For those of us who have been campaigning on the issue for years, it is the news we’ve been waiting for.</p><p itemprop="text">The judgement is important because it confirms that museums do not have valid copyright in photographs of (two-dimensional) works which are themselves out of copyright. It means these photographs are in the public domain, and free to use.</p><p itemprop="text">Museums use copyright to restrict the circulation of images, obliging people to buy expensive licences. Any thought of scholars sharing images, or using those available on museum websites, was claimed to be a breach of copyright. Not surprisingly, most people paid up. Copyright is the glue that holds the image fee ecosystem in place.</p><p itemprop="text">What has now changed? Museums used to rely on the 1988 Copyright, Designs and Patents Act, which placed a low threshold on how copyright was acquired; essentially, if some degree of “skill and labour” was involved in taking a photograph of a painting, then that photograph enjoyed copyright. But subsequent case law has raised the bar, as the new Appeal Court judgement makes clear.</p><p itemprop="text">In his ruling (<em>THJ v Sheridan</em>, 2023), Lord Justice Arnold wrote that, for copyright to arise: “What is required is that the author was able to express their creative abilities in the production of the work by making free and creative choices so as to stamp the work created with their personal touch”. Importantly, he went on: “This criterion is not satisfied where the content of the work is dictated by technical considerations, rules or other constraints which leave no room for creative freedom”. In other words, if the aim of a museum photograph is to accurately reproduce a painting (which it must be), then it cannot acquire copyright.</p><h3>Copyright bar since 2009</h3><p itemprop="text">Moreover, Lord Justice Arnold pointed out that the new copyright bar has been in place since 2009. This raises doubts about the basis on which most museums have sold image licences since then. As Eleonora Rosati, professor of intellectual property law at Stockholm University tells me, “technically, this has been wrong for ten-plus years”.</p><p itemprop="text">In fact, some museums have long been aware of the true status of UK copyright law, despite suggesting otherwise publicly. The Tate has internally accepted the new definition for some years, yet still claims copyright over its historic collection in a number of ways. In a statement to me, the Tate says it charges fees “for supplying high-resolution digital images from our picture library. These are different to copyright fees, which are not applied to images unless they are covered by copyright law.” Of course, the Tate only has to use its picture library to supply high-resolution images because it only shows low-resolution images on its website.</p><p itemprop="text">But here is the main point: those © symbols on UK museum websites and catalogues are now redundant if the original artwork is itself out of copyright. There is no reason not to use these images for free (and nobody would argue against paying for new images, if needed). The National Gallery marks images “© National Gallery”, and in its terms and conditions forbids reproduction unless “expressly permitted under copyright law”. But since there is no copyright, reproduction is indeed permitted (expressly or otherwise, there is no distinction). No major UK museum has taken anyone to court over copyright of such images, and no sensible trustee will let them now.</p><p itemprop="text">Surely museums will now change their policies? The National Gallery told me in a statement: “We are aware of this recent Appeal Court ruling and we will be reviewing its guidance.” Since I have also established, through a Freedom of Information request, that the National Gallery has been losing money on its image licensing operation, hopefully it will embrace this chance to abolish image fees altogether. Then the gallery, art historians and the public, will be practically, legally, culturally and financially better off. For art history, this is a judgement where everyone wins.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">DRµGS</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Stop messing around with finicky sampling parameters and just use DRµGS!</h3>
<p dir="auto">This repo introduces Deep Random Micro-Glitch Sampling (DRµGS).</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The Problem:</h2>
<p dir="auto">At a high level, the generative model landscape looks like first spending millions of dollars pretraining a giant model to predict the collective works of humanity, then giving those predictions to a dumb-as-rocks random number generator to kindly take into consideration in its role as the final arbiter over the multi-million dollar model's canonical output (which the model is then forced to commit to on its next prediction pass).</p>
<p dir="auto">This is kinda nuts.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The Solution:</h2>
<p dir="auto">DRµGS just inverts this scheme. Instead of using noise to sample from the model's predictions, DRµGS injects noise directly into the transformer layers at inference time, thereby varying what the model predicts. From here, simply selecting the most likely prediction is often enough to increase output variety while maintaining coherence.</p>
<p dir="auto">Intuitively, the primary advantage of this scheme (though there's more than one) is that the model has ample opportunity in its later layers to correct or account for our perturbations in its earlier layers.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Should I use DRµGS?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Absolutely. But do note that this proof of concept repo only supports LLaMA models. This isn't a technical limitation, and I'm very open to contributions from anyone willing to help me make DRµGS.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can get a sense of its generation quality in this colab chat with Alan Watts.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-1TpLb4fcdUU-zahaKY_TOr7jI-88DdQ?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f5e0d0538a9c2972b5d413e0ace04cecd8efd828d133133933dfffec282a4e1b/68747470733a2f2f636f6c61622e72657365617263682e676f6f676c652e636f6d2f6173736574732f636f6c61622d62616467652e737667" alt="Open In Colab" data-canonical-src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg"></a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Are there any negative side effects from using DRµGS?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Negative side effects are difficult to identify subjectively, and in my experience DRµGs feel great the whole time you're using them.
In theory however, yes, prolonged use of DRµGS can have negative side effects that get worse over time.</p>
<p dir="auto">Specifically, when injecting noise into layers &lt; n, the hidden state vectors in all layers &gt;=n will be conditioned on this noisy input, and if you're using kv-caching, that noise-conditioned prediction will remain in the cache only to be pertutbed again on the next forward pass.</p>
<p dir="auto">This library includes a <code>cold_shower</code> function, which periodically sobers up the cache after every t-predictions, or which you can elect to call yourself while the model is awaiting user input. This is to allow for some measure of theoretical purity, but again, in my experience it seems unnecessary, and using it means contending with periodically having to wait for your model to finish its shower before it can use more DRµGS.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What kind of DRµGs can I use?</h3>
<p dir="auto">While not an exhaustive list of the DRµGs that are theoretically possible, this repo provides implementations and experimental data for four types of DRµGs. These are Q, K, V, and A; which inject noise into the Query, Key, Value, and Attention head outputs, respectively.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How do I use DRµGs?</h3>
<p dir="auto">First, install this library.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pip install git+https://github.com/EGjoni/DRUGS.git"><pre>pip install git+https://github.com/EGjoni/DRUGS.git</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then, import it into your project, and decide which and how much DRµGS you want your model to use.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="import torch

<p dir="auto">The `dose_theta`` parameter basically just defines a maximum angle in radians by which to randomly rotate the A, Q, K, or V vectors. You probably shouldn't go past 0.1, but this kind of depends on which drug and where you're injecting it.</p>
<p dir="auto">But this is also kind of where things get interesting. Consider the following starting prompt:</p>

<p dir="auto">(Interactive versions of these graphs, as well as ones for Q and V dosages are available as .html files in the <code>experiments/vergence_plots/Hamilton_*</code> directory of this repo)</p>
<p dir="auto">To clarify these graphs:
The prediction texts on the top right correspond solely to a (quite high) dosage theta of 0.7. The predictions listed are the top 10 most likely as per the sober model. THe <code>|||</code> bars indicate likelihood as per the DRµGS augmented model, turning into <code>-</code> to indcate how far they fall short of the baseline prediction, or <code>+</code> to indicate how much they exceed the baseline prediction.
Each video frame shows a different range of layers into which noise is being injected (as indicarted by the graph title at that frame)
The horizontal axis shows the layer at which divergence is being measured.
The vertical axis shows the degree of divergence at that layer.
And the remaining axis shows the dose theta that was used to cause that degree of divergence.</p>
<p dir="auto">It might be a bit much to grok at a glance, but once you've wrapped your head around it, a few things might immediately stand out.</p>
<p dir="auto">First, we can add quite a lot of noise in earlier layers and the model very quickly drowns that noise out with its own signal. (This is likely part of why franken-merges work so well. It's not just that the residual stream keeps values in a reasonable region to avoid too much harm, it seem to be also that each layer of the model actively wants to push its inputs into something it can make sense of).</p>
<p dir="auto">Second, something special seems to happen in the middle layers that causes relatively large spikes in output divergence.</p>
<p dir="auto">And third, the most likely prediction changes, but generally remains reasonable.</p>
<p dir="auto">I feel like there's a lot more to play with and discover here, but, it's gonna need crowdsourcing. Personally my next step is to see (very seriously) explore the potential of DRµGS to control model hallucinations.</p>
<p dir="auto">Anyway -- critiques and contributions welcome. And I'll have a mistral implementation up soon.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">In the meantime, please experiment with DRµGS!</h3>

        <header>

        </header>

        
        <p>This is a technique I’ve used in actual for-pay software, but
most recently in my text adventure game editor, <a href="https://ratfactor.com/hiss/">Hiss</a>.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="_the_problem_you_want_a_tree_like_list_in_your_ui">The problem: you want a tree-like list in your UI</h2>
<div>
<p>Let’s say you have this fantastic dynamic list of Foo and Bar data and you
would like to display it in a tree view of some sort in your application:</p>
<div>
<pre>My Foos
    Foo 1
        Foo 1.a
        Foo 1.b
    Foo 2
    Foo 3
My Bars
    Bar I
        Baz baz baz
    Bar II
    Bar III
    Bar IV
...</pre>
</div>
<p>This obviously you need to implement some sort of parent-child relationship
between these items, right?</p>
<p>That sounds like a lot of work and potentially awkward-to-work-with data
structure, especially if stored in a database. But surely there is no way
around it. It’s "obviously" the only way to go.</p>
<p>Okay, so let’s do that. You could express this with a parent ID.
Something like this, if you’re using a database:</p>
<div>
<pre>  id | sort | name    | parent
 ----+------+---------+-------
  13 | 1    | Foo     | null
  78 | 1    | Foo 1   | 13
  98 | 1    | Foo 1.a | 78
  99 | 2    | Foo 1.b | 78
  ...</pre>
</div>
<p>Now how to do we work with this?</p>
<p>Well, for example, one way to get tree-structured data from a relational
database with a SQL query is to write a recursive CTE (Common Table
Expressions), which are just as fun as they sound.</p>
<p>If you’re a programmer, you’re probably already thinking about how you would
display this data…​</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_wait_but_does_your_data_really_need_to_be_a_tree">Wait, but does your data <em>really</em> need to be a tree?</h2>
<div>
<p>Do your items actually have to have a parent-child relationship, or do they
just need to <em>look</em> like they do?</p>
<p>I find that these lists are often just formatted this way for human
organization. There’s no actual need for a formal relationship between them.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, a vastly simpler method for storing this tree is:</p>
<div>
<pre>  id | sort | indent | name
 ----+------+--------+-------
  13 | 1    | 0      | Foo
  78 | 2    | 1      | Foo 1
  98 | 3    | 2      | Foo 1.a
  99 | 4    | 2      | Foo 1.b
  ...</pre>
</div>
<p>Why is this simpler? Because it literally describes what you see on the screen.
Which means it’s easy as pie to render. Note how the sort order is now absolute
for the entire list, not for sub-item order. The indent is quite literally how
much space to put before the item.</p>
<p>And it’s not just display the list that becomes easier - making an interface to
<em>edit</em> this tree can also be much simpler now. You can simply let the user
move items up and down and indent/unindent them to their heart’s content (or
put in some simple rules to enforce correct indenting - that’s up to you).
It becomes more like editing a list in a word processor than interfacing with
a data structure straight out of a computer science text book.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_another_example_using_namespacing">Another example using "namespacing"</h2>
<div>

<p>I’ve got items with these names from a silly example game:</p>
<div>
<pre>Start
banana
banana.eat
banana.peel
banana.sniff
banana.throw away
monkey
...</pre>
</div>
<p>And these render in the interface like so:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://ratfactor.com/hiss/hiss18.png" alt="a things list contains sub-items under the banana thing: eat" width="peel" height="sniff">
</p>
</div>
<p>It appears I implemented some sort of namespacing feature to HissScript.</p>
<p>But I didn’t!</p>
<p>I’m just sorting the items alphabetically and if I see a dot (".") in a name, I
chop off the first part and indent the item.</p>
<p>As with the Foo and Bar list in the previous example, it looks like the game
editor "understands" the relationship, but that’s just an illusion.</p>
<p>Just to give a sense of how simple this is, here’s the entirety of the list
drawing code (JavaScript):</p>
<div>
<pre>var names = Object.keys(objs).sort();

return names.map(function(n){
    if(m = /^.+(\..+)$/.exec(n)){
        return ["a.indent", {onclick:link(n)}, m[1]];
    }
    return ["a", {onclick:link(n)}, n];
});</pre>
</div>
<p>And that’s raw editor code that sets up click handlers and everything. The
pseudocode logic is just:</p>
<div>
<pre>names = sort(things.keys)
each names as name:
    if contains('.', name):
        print_indent chop_before('.', name)
    else
        print name</pre>
</div>
<p>(I later added a check to make sure a "parent" item with the given prefix
exists before doing the indent/chop. But that was just another couple lines.
Also, it would be no problem to add arbitrarily deep nesting levels to this
namespacing feature but I’m waiting for an actual need.)</p>
<p>The "namespacing" appearance is <em>very</em> important for a human trying to organize
a game. But it means <em>nothing</em> to the game editor and player. Names with dots
in them are just names. The namespacing keeps them unique, but that’s it.</p>
<p>I learned the hard way long ago: more often than not, people don’t
actually want (or need) trees, they just need the <em>appearance</em> of them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_bonus_tree_as_list">Bonus tree-as-list</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Dave Long writes:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Low-tech real trees: store path + info in a flat list (like the output of find)."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>That’s definitely true and is essentially the insight behind my "banana.eat"
example above. Here’s some fake <code>find</code> output:</p>
<div>
<pre>./foo/zonk
./foo/bonk
./bar/boop/bop
./bar/boop/bleep</pre>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Want a depth-first traversal? lexically sort by the path."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>For sure:</p>
<div>
<pre>./bar/boop/bleep
./bar/boop/bop
./foo/bonk
./foo/zonk</pre>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Want a breadth-first traversal? sort by the (properly padded) reversal of the path"</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Hmmm…​let’s see:</p>
<div>
<pre>bleep/boop/bar
bonk/foo
bop/boop/bar
zonk/foo</pre>
</div>
<p>That’s interesting.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_physical_analogy">Physical analogy</h2>
<div>
<p>Just to hammer on the point, let’s say you’re working on your personal
scrapbook. You’re starting to put boxes of photos, notes, postcards, ticket stubs,
etc. into some sort of order. You’re laying everything out on the floor and
you’re making some really nice groupings of items and you’ve even made little
folded paper signs to label the groups.</p>
<p>Even though it is <em>glaringly obvious</em> to you, the human, how these groups work,
is there actually any physical mechanism built into your floor to enforce this
relationship? Of course not. <strong>The floor has no idea what’s going on.</strong></p>
<p><em>(Or if it does, you have accidentally moved into a home built
over an ancient burial ground and are in immediate danger. Pack a bag and
leave now. Sleep in a hotel tonight and you can think about how to get your
belongings and find a new home when you’ve got a clear head tomorrow morning.
The scrapbook can wait for a better time when you’re less likely to be eaten
by skeletons.)</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_caution_one_size_does_not_fit_all">Caution: One size does not fit all</h2>
<div>
<p>I’m sure there are infinite variations on this and I’m sure I’m not the first
person to think either of the above two example techniques. But I have never
seen anyone mention it before. So anything like this will probably count as a
"hack" in most programming circles.</p>
<p>You will almost definitely need to heavily adapt it to your specific scenario.</p>
<p>And for the love of all that is good, if you <strong>actually need a tree</strong>, use a
tree. Do the whole parent ID thing (or separate parent/child join table or
whatever makes sense to your data model).</p>
<p>In the physical analogy above, if you’re cataloging a massive research project
and you <em>need</em> the organizing power of physical filing cabinets and
neatly-labeled folders, the floor method is not going to cut it!
<em>(Just make sure you’re not using haunted filing cabinets.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Do not</strong> hack something with indents or counting symbols in strings or some
nonsense like that if you will ever need to <em>actually know</em> the relationship
between your items. Yes, you can do it, but it will be a path of suffering
for the lifetime of the project and all of its maintenance forever after.
Don’t say I didn’t warn you.</p>

            </p></div>

            <p>It seems no matter how long I work with the command line, every once in a while
I find handy utilities I've never encountered before. Most people have heard
about <strike>the bird</strike> <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/">coreutils</a>, that's where utilities such as
<code>echo</code>, <code>cat</code>, and others come from. But did you know about <a href="https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/">moreutils</a>?</p>
<h4>ts</h4>
<p>Say I want to trace every program invocation (~<em>exec()</em>) on the system. I can do
that with <code>execsnoop</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">BPF Compiler Collection</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span># execsnoop
</span><span>ls   1586  1401  0  /usr/bin/ls --color=auto -F
</span><span>git  1587  1401  0  /usr/bin/git rev-parse ...
</span></code></pre>
<p>Apparently every time I touch a terminal, it runs Git to determine whether I'm
within a Git repository just so that it can show me the current branch in the
prompt. Surely that doesn't slow things down. What it doesn't show me is the
time of the invocation though. I can easily add it with <code>ts</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span># execsnoop | ts
</span><span>Dec 19 12:39:25 ls   1791  1401  0 /usr/bin/ls --color=auto -F
</span><span>Dec 19 12:39:25 git  1792  1401  0 /usr/bin/git rev-parse ...
</span></code></pre>
<p>I now realize that <code>execsnoop</code> does have the <code>-T</code> flag which adds invocation
times so there's no need for <code>ts</code> in this case but I've already written these
examples so yeah. <code>ts</code> can also convert time stamps into relative times. This is
especially handy when looking through log files.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ journalctl --since yesterday --priority emerg..warning
</span><span>Dec 18 19:30:47 vm sudo[5068]:  user: 3 incorrect password attempts
</span><span>
</span><span>$ journalctl --since yesterday --priority emerg..warning | ts -r
</span><span>18h7m ago vm sudo[5068]:  user: 3 incorrect password attempts
</span></code></pre>
<h4>sponge</h4>
<p>Have you ever wanted to modify a file, save the result into the same file, and
got quickly disappointed with the result?</p>
<pre><code><span>$ echo 1\n3\n2 &gt; file.txt
</span><span>$ sort file.txt &gt; file.txt
</span><span>
</span><span>$ wc -l file.txt
</span><span>0 file.txt # empty
</span></code></pre>
<p>Remember, it is the shell which is responsible for redirecting the output, not
the individual commands. In this case, when the shell sees <em>&gt; file.txt</em>, it
opens <code>file.txt</code> for writing (or creates it if necessary). Crucially, it also
opens the file with the <code>O_TRUNC</code> flag which instantly truncates (empties) the
file. When <code>sort</code> later opens the file to do the actual work, it finds the file
empty and exits.</p>
<p>The most common workaround is to first redirect the output to a temporary file
and then move it back to the original name. And that's exactly what <code>sponge</code>
does behind the scenes for you.</p>
<pre><code><span>echo 1\n3\n2 &gt; file.txt
</span><span>sort file.txt | sponge file.txt
</span></code></pre>
<p>Interestingly, some of the commands from <code>coreutils</code> have a "-o" flag. I could
have just written <code>sort -o file.txt file.txt</code>. Oh well.</p>
<h4>vidir</h4>
<p>This is probably what I use most often. Running <code>vidir</code> opens your <code>$EDITOR</code> or
<code>$VISUAL</code> with files / directories of the specified directory (or the current
directory) and allows you to edit them. If you change the name, it will rename
it. If you delete a file row, the file gets deleted. To delete an entire
directory with everything in it, delete its row and all sub entries.</p>
<pre><code><span>vidir *.pdf
</span><span>
</span><span>fd -t f | vidir -
</span></code></pre>
<p>What if you've made so many great changes that you want to just quit the editor
without applying any of them? You just need to quit the editor with exit code
<code>1</code>. In Vim / Helix you do that with <code>:cq</code>. This by the way works in pretty
much all cases where a command invokes your editor (e.g. when writing a commit
message).</p>
<p>If your distribution doesn't provide <code>moreutils</code>, there's also <code>qmv</code> from
<a href="https://www.nongnu.org/renameutils">renameutils</a>.</p>
<h4>vipe</h4>
<p>This is a bit dirty but can be useful sometimes. Imagine you want to process a
bunch of files but cannot get the damned file name regex right and so you have
a few extra files in the output. You could just write the output to a file, edit
it, and continue from there but there a more fragile option - edit the output
right between the pipes!</p>
<pre><code><span>fd | vipe | ...
</span></code></pre>
<p>In this case, the output from <code>fd</code> will be buffered by <code>vipe</code> and passed to your
configured text editor. You can make any changes you want and once you quit, the
data will be passed down the pipe if any. The downside is that if you want to
run the command again, you will need to also edit output again. It's probably a
better idea to just write it into a file. At least in this scenario.</p>
<h4>pee</h4>
<p>I'm going to mention this not because I have an actual use case for this but
just because it took me a second to realize what it actually does. <code>pee</code> takes
its stdin and passes it to all commands given as arguments. It then gathers
their output and sends that as its own output. It runs the commands using
<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/popen.3.html">popen</a>, so it's actually passing them to <code>/bin/sh -c</code> (which on most systems is
a symlink to Bash).</p>
<pre><code><span>$ echo "Alice" | pee "xargs echo Hello" "xargs echo Hi"
</span><span>Hello Alice
</span><span>Hi Alice
</span></code></pre>
<p>I think those are all the commands I regularly use / I've used. There are  more
available, such as <code>chronic</code> (print output only if the command failed) or <code>ifne</code>
(run command only if there's non empty stdin) but I haven't needed them yet.</p>
<p>Besides more commands in <code>moreutils</code>, there are even more of these command sets such as <a href="https://github.com/rudymatela/evenmoreutils">evenmoreutils</a> or <a href="https://suso.suso.org/programs/num-utils/index.phtml">num-utils</a>.</p>

December 30, 2023</p>
<p>Why Android developers no longer need Windows USB drivers</p><hr>


<p>In the early days of the platform, Android developers working from Linux and Mac OS X connected their device via an USB cable and were good to go. Windows users had to find and then install drivers. That was super-annoying.</p>

<p>Nowadays there is no more need for drivers. What happened?</p>



<p>USB Driver/OS 101</p><hr><p>When you plug an USB device into a port, the operating system needs to load drivers for its interface(s). This is done by inspecting the USB Descriptors hierarchy.</p>

<pre>Device Descriptor
├─ Configuration Descriptor
│         └─ Interface Descriptor
│                 └─ Endpoint_Descriptors
├─ String Descriptors
└─ Device Qualifier Descriptor      
</pre>
<p>Oftentimes, reading the Device Descriptor <a href="https://www.keil.com/pack/doc/mw/USB/html/_u_s_b__device__descriptor.html">Vendor ID (VPI) and Product ID (PID) fields</a><a name="back_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> is enough to decide which drivers should be loaded.</p>

  
<p>All three major OSs ship with "default" Device Class drivers so most USB devices work auto-magically<a name="back_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.
 If I connect my ErgoDox EZ keyboard, Windows attaches <code>hidusb.sys.</code> to it<a name="back_3" href="#footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> and I don't need a driver.</p>
<p>If Windows cannot find a built-in Device Class driver (or if they are better matches), it loads user-installed drivers. e.g. an Apple Magic Trackpad will also get <code>hidusb.sys</code> unless Bingxing Wang's <a href="https://github.com/imbushuo/mac-precision-touchpad/tree/master">awesome driver</a> is installed, in which case Windows loads <code>AmtPtpDeviceUm.dll</code> (with support for right-click and multi-finger gestures).</p>


<p>Why it did not work</p><hr><p>If no driver can be found, Linux loads <code>usbfs</code> which lets user-space programs access the device. Mac OS does the same, with <code>IOKit</code>. Windows reports an error. No driver is loaded and the Android device cannot be accessed.</p>


<p>Why it worked with an android driver</p><hr><p>To understand what is going on when a driver is installed, let's inspect the "brain" from <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/android_windows_driver/usb_driver_r13-windows.zip">Google USB Driver</a>, <code>android_winusb.inf</code>.</p>

<pre>;Google Nexus One
%SingleAdbInterface%        = <span color="red">USB_Install</span>, USB\VID_<span color="green">18D1</span>&amp;PID_<span color="blue">4E11</span>

[<span color="red">USB_Install</span>]
Include = winusb.inf
Needs   = <span color="orange">WINUSB.NT</span>
</pre>

<p>In <code>INF</code> parlance, it instructs "When VID=0x<span color="green">18D1</span> and PID=0x<span color="blue">4E11</span> (a.k.a: a Google Nexus One), load <span color="orange"><code>winusb</code></span> driver".</p>

<p>What is WinUSB? Alike Linux's <code>usbfs</code> and Mac OS's <code>IOKit</code> it is an USB driver which allows user-space programs to enumerate interfaces and write/read into/from the endpoints<a name="back_4" href="#footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. That is what <code>adb</code> (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Debug_Bridge">Android Debug Bridge</a>) uses to chat with an Android device.</p>


<p>Why Android devices no longer need a windows driver</p><hr><p>The method previously described has an obvious flaw. If an Android device VendorID/ProductID are not listed, <code>winusb</code> is not loaded.</p>

<p>Windows 8 has a better way than <code>INF</code> files to discover which driver an interface needs. It asks directly to the device!</p>

<p>When a device is connected, the OS issues a String Descriptors request at index <code>0xEE</code>. If the device is Microsoft OS Descriptors (MOD) compatible, it returns the string <code>M\0S\0F\0T\01\000\0\0</code>. In this case, Windows requests the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/usbcon/microsoft-defined-usb-descriptors">Extended Compat ID OS Feature Descriptor</a>.</p>

<p>We can inspect this descriptor on a Pixel 6 with <code>libusb</code>'s <code>xusb</code>.</p>

<pre>$ ./xusb 18d1:4ee2

[...]

Reading string descriptors:
   String (0x01): "Google"
   String (0x02): "AOSP on Oriole"
   String (0x03): "0123456789ABCD"

Reading OS string descriptor:

Reading Extended Compat ID OS Feature Descriptor (wIndex = 0x0004):

  00000000  40 00 00 00 00 01 04 00 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  @...............

</pre>

<p>This device was set up with both Media Transfer Protocol and developer mode enabled. For each of these interfaces, the Feature Descriptor instructs which driver it needs. Respectively <code>mtp.sys</code> for the first interface and <code>winusb.sys</code> on the second interface.</p>


<p>With <code>winusb.sys</code> loaded, user-space executables such as <code>adb</code> can open the device, claim the interface, and get the developer rolling. No need for drivers anymore!</p>


<p>Which devices support Microsoft OS Descriptors?</p><hr><p>Going through my personal collection of Pixels, MODs support seems to have started between Pixel 2 (2017) and Pixel 3a (2019) (sorry, I don't have a Pixel 3 to test).</p>

<p>Extended Properties OS Feature Descriptor</p><hr>More recent devices like the Pixel 8 have an Extended Properties OS Feature Descriptor. It can feature GUID, help pages, URLs, and even icons.

</ul>



<h2 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>



<p>I used private and public LLMs to answer an undergraduate essay question I spent a week working on nearly 30 years ago, in an effort to see how the experience would have changed in that time. There were two rules:</p>



<ul>
<li>No peeking at the original essay, and </li>



<li>No reading any of the suggested material, except to find references.</li>
</ul>



<p>The experience turned out to be radically different with AI assistance in some ways, and similar in others.</p>



<p>If you’re not interested in my life story and the gory detail, <a href="https://zwischenzugs.com/2023/12/25/what-i-learned-using-private-llms-to-write-an-undergraduate-history-essay/#what-i-learned">skip to the end for what I learned</a>. </p>



<h2 id="context">Context</h2>



<p>Although I work in software now, there was a time when I wanted to be a journalist. To that end I did a degree in History at Oxford. Going up in 1994, I entered an academic world before mobile phones, and with an Internet that was so nascent that the ‘computer room’ was still fighting for space with the snooker table for space next to the library (the snooker table was ejected a few years later, sadly). We didn’t even have phones in our dorms: you had to communicate with fellow students either in person, or via an internal ‘pigeon post’ system.</p>



<p>My typical week then was probably similar to a week of a History student in 1964: tutorials were generally on Friday, where I would be given the essay question and reading list for the following week: </p>

<p>That afternoon I would go to several libraries, hoping that other students studying the same module hadn’t borrowed the books on the list. Over the following week I would try to read and make notes on the material as much as possible given my busy schedule of drinking incredibly cheap and nasty red wine, feeling depressed, and suffering from the endless colds living in Oxford (which is built on a bog) gifts you free of charge.</p>



<p>The actual writing of the essay would take place on the day before delivery, and involve a lot of procrastination (solitaire and minesweeper on my Compaq laptop, as I recall) while the painful process of squeezing the juices from my notes took place.</p>



<p>I didn’t go to lectures. They were way too early in the afternoon for me to get out of bed for.</p>

<p>Already I was way ahead of my younger self. I had an idea of what the broad strokes I needed to hit were to get a passable essay together. ChatGPT is great for this kind of surveying or summarizing stuff, but is pretty bad at writing an undergraduate-level essay for you. It can write a <em>passable</em> essay (literally), but it will be very obvious it was written by an LLM, and probably at best get you a 2:2 or a third, due to the broad-brush tone and supine mealy-mouthed ‘judgements’ which contain very little content.</p>

<p>I was now ready to gather the information I needed to write the essay.</p>



<h3 id="gathering-the-sources">Gathering the Sources</h3>



<p>The first step was to get the materials. It took me a couple of hours to find all the texts (through various, uh, avenues) and process them into plain text. I couldn’t get the journal articles (they were academically paywalled), which was a shame, as they tended to be the best source of figuring out what academic debate was behind the question.</p>



<p>It totalled about 10M of data:</p>


<div><pre title="">756K    high_and_low_politics_in_modern_britain_bentley.txt
1.3M    lancashire_and_the_new_liberalism.txt
904K    liberalism_and_sociology_collini.txt
1012K   liberals_and_social_democrats.txt
812K    liberals_radicals_and_social_politics_emy.txt
684K    new_liberalism_allett.txt
1.5M    our_partnership__beatrice_webb.txt
556K    the_age_of_lloyd_george_kenneth_o_morgan.txt
708K    the_new_liberalism_freeden.txt
540K    the_new_liberalism_weiler.txt
148K    the_origins_of_the_liberal_welfare_reforms_hay.txt
1.1M    unemployment_a_problem_of_industry_beveridge.txt
</pre></div>


<p>Those couple of hours would have been reduced significantly for any future essay I might choose to write, as I spent some time figuring out exactly where to get them and installing software to extract the plain text. So <strong>I would now allocate an hour to getting the vast majority of texts</strong>, as opposed to the small subset of texts I would hunt down over a significantly longer time in the physical libraries 30 years ago.</p>



<h3 id="privategpt">PrivateGPT</h3>



<p>One of the well-known limitations with ChatGPT is that it doesn’t tell you what the relevant sources are that it looked at to generate the text it gives you.</p>



<p>I found out that this <a href="https://github.com/imartinez/penpotfest_workshop?tab=readme-ov-file#penpotfest-privategpt-workshop">repo</a> gives us a quick way to augment an LLM with a set of documents, so I installed it on an old Dell Xeon desktop with 24 cores and 128G of RAM. This machine cost me about £600 a couple of years ago, and still works a treat (I bought it to run Kubernetes clusters). It doesn’t have a graphics card in it, so I thought it would be usable for this kind of work, but it’s just fine with ‘normal’ CPUs (as long as you don’t demand instant responses).</p>



<pre>$ python3 ingest.py<br>Appending to existing vectorstore at db<br>Using embedded DuckDB with persistence: data will be stored in: db<br>Loading documents from source_documents<br>Loading new documents: 100%|███████████████████| 12/12 [00:00&lt;00:00, 274.84it/s]<br>Loaded 12 new documents from source_documents<br>Split into 38046 chunks of text (max. 350 tokens each)<br>Creating embeddings. May take some minutes…<br>Ingestion complete! You can now run privateGPT.py to query your documents</pre>



<p>Ingestion of the 10M sources took about five minutes. I asked it a few questions, and this was a typical output:</p>



<pre>&gt; Question:<br>what was the changing role of the state in new versus old liberalism<p>&gt; Answer (took 169.94 s.):<br> The main difference between "new" and "old" liberalism lies in their approach towards the role of the government within society. While traditional or 'Old' liberals believed that minimizing intervention by the State would lead to a more prosperous economy, ‘New’ Liberals acknowledged the need for state action and social reform as necessary measures against industrial poverty. In essence, new liberalism marked an evolution of thought among liberals towards greater acceptance of government responsibility in promoting general welfare through interventionist policies.</p><p>&gt; source_documents/the_age_of_lloyd_george_kenneth_o_morgan.txt:<br>It was, therefore, the Old Liberalism which helped to repair the fortunes of the party—nonconformity and industrial free trade, the very essence of the Liberal<br>faith for half a century. Where, however, was the ‘New Liberalism’ which could embrace a more positive attitude towards the central government, for which many</p><p>&gt; source_documents/the_new_liberalism_weiler.txt:<br>In the broadest sense, the term new Liberalism refers both to the welfare legislation of the 1906-14 administration and to the changes in Liberal social and<br>political theory. At the time, however, the term first referred to the theoretical changes which preceded the legislative achievements of the Liberal government.</p><p>&gt; source_documents/the_new_liberalism_weiler.txt:<br>What then was the new Liberalism? As defined here, it was the modification of Liberal ideology from a vehicle for a mid-Victorian ideal of laissez-faire to a<br>philosophy based on state action and social reform to cope with industrial poverty. This modification was achieved by Liberal journalists and theorists seeking to</p><p>&gt; source_documents/the_new_liberalism_weiler.txt:<br>state, a development that represents the fruition of the new Liberalism.</p><p>New Liberalism<br>The Political Economy<br>of J.A. Hobson</p><p>UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO PRESS<br>Toronto Buffalo London</p><p>Toronto Buffalo London<br>Printed in Canada<br>ISBN 0-8020-5558-3</p><p>&gt; source_documents/the_new_liberalism_weiler.txt:<br>understanding of the phenomenon of the new Liberalism itself.</p><p>&gt; source_documents/the_new_liberalism_freeden.txt:<br>THE SOCIAL POLICY OL THE NEW LIBERALISM</p></pre>



<p>You can see that the output is mixed in quality (the model I used was relatively small, see Ollama section below), but it did point me at potentially relevant sources for quotes and bits to read. I spent about another hour rooting around these texts and gathering bits of text that I might use later. Note the response time, however (about three minutes is typical).<strong> I got a bit frustrated with the response time vs quality and went looking for other tech to use.</strong></p>



<h3 id="ollama-and-llama2-70b">Ollama (and Llama2:70b)</h3>



<p>This was the combination of technology that blew my mind. It absolutely changes the game for this kind of work. <a href="https://ollama.ai/">Ollama</a> is a project designed to ‘get up and running with large language models locally’ which borrows concepts from Docker (like the <code>Modelfile</code> (similar to the <code>Dockerfile</code>, and <code>ollama get/pull/list</code>)</p>



<p><strong>Compared to the ChatGPT output, Llama2:70b (with a Llama2 model with 70b parameters) allowed me to automate a significant chunk of the work needed to write the essay</strong>, reducing the time needed to write the essay from days to less than a day.</p>



<p>I downloaded the biggest model I could find (Llama2:70b) and asked it the question in a very unspecific way. It returned a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ianmiell/llm_history_essay/main/llama2_essay_plan.txt">much better essay plan</a> than ChatGPT did: </p>



<p>At this point I started writing the body of the essay (introductions and conclusions are best left to the end), basing each paragraph on the numbered points above. As I wrote, looked at specific texts to find references and asked LLMs questions, <strong>something unexpected happened: I was learning about the nuances of the debate</strong> (mainly through looking the Collini book I hadn’t been able to find in the 90s).</p>



<p>I was getting sucked into a temptation to actually read the texts, and had to remind myself that I wasn’t allowed to do that, according to the rules of the ‘game’ I was playing here.</p>



<p><strong>This appreciation of which texts were important, and what I was being invited to write about happened </strong><em>much</em> faster than would have been the case pre-Internet. I really do wonder how students do this today (get in touch if you can tell me!).</p>



<h2 id="hallucinations">Hallucinations</h2>



<p>A well-known limitation of LLMs is their tendency to ‘hallucinate’, or ‘bullshit’ a plausible-seeming answer. I definitely saw this, and it wasted some time for me. Llama2 gave me this nice quote, which raised suspicions with me as it seemed too good to be true:</p>



<pre>Evidence: In his book "Industrial Democracy" (1902), Webb argues that collective ownership and control of the means of production is necessary to address the systemic issues that perpetuate poverty and inequality. He writes, "The only way to secure industrial democracy is through the collective ownership and control of the means of production."</pre>



<p>But I couldn’t find that quote anywhere in the book. Llama2 just made it up.</p>







<p><strong>After writing my <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ianmiell/llm_history_essay/main/essay.txt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI-assisted essay</a>, I took a look at my <a href="https://github.com/ianmiell/llm_history_essay/blob/main/original_essay.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original essay from 1996</a>. To my surprise, the older one was far longer than I remembered essays being (about 2500 words to my AI-assisted one’s 1300), and was, it seemed to me, much higher quality than my AI-assisted one.</strong> It may have been longer because it was written in my final year, where I was probably at the peak of my essay-writing skills.</p>



<p><strong>It took me about six hours of work (spread over 4 days) to write the AI-assisted essay. The original essay would have taken me a whole week, but the actual number of hours spent actively researching and writing it would have been at minimum 20, and at most 30 hours.</strong></p>



<p>I believe I could have easily doubled the length of my essay to match my old one without reducing the quality of its content. But without actually reading the texts I don’t think I would have improved from there.</p>



<p>I learned that:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>There’s still no substitute for hard study.</strong> My self-imposed rule that I couldn’t read the texts limited the quality to a certain point that couldn’t be made up for with AI.</li>



<li><strong>History students using AI should be much more productive than they were in my day!</strong> I wonder whether essays are far longer now than they used to be.</li>



<li><strong>Private LLMs (I used <a href="https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">llama2:70b</a>) can be way more useful than ChatGPT3.5 for this type of work</strong>, not only in the quality of generated response, but also the capability to identify relevant passages of text.</li>



<li><strong>I might have reduced the time significantly with some more work to combine the llama2:70b model with the reference-generating code I had.</strong> More research is needed here.</li>
</ul>



<p>Hope you enjoyed my trip down memory lane. The world of humanities study is not one I’m in any more, but it must be being changed radically by LLMs, just as it must have been by the internet. If you’re in that world now, and want to update me on how you’re using AI, get in touch. </p>

            <section>
                <p>In the past few years, I've heard a lot about Avro, Parquet, ORC, Arrow and Feather, but I also keep hearing about Iceberg and Delta Lake. As a "database person", I’ve been struggling to understand all of these different things, and how they relate to Data Lakes and Data Lakehouses (and what exactly <em>are</em> these?). So, I’ve decided to study them, and consolidate my knowledge in writing.</p><p>To do this, I had to review quite a bit of content over the last few weeks. I’ll try to link to most of what I’ve read and watched at the bottom of this article. However, this blog post won’t be 100% comprehensive, or even the best starting point for most people. That’s because I’m writing this for myself. I find that the best way to learn new things is by "forcing myself" to re-explain them to others. Anyhow, I hope this is useful to some people!</p><h2 id="how-data-gets-stored-in-files-and-in-memory">How Data Gets Stored (in Files and in Memory)</h2><p>Let’s start with understanding the different file formats for efficient data access and storage. While some systems mainly operate on data formats that are closed (e.g., SingleStoreDB, where I work, Teradata, SQL Server, Snowflake), others operate on open data formats. And these days, most of them, like Snowflake, Redshift, Athena or Hive, support reading and writing into <em>both</em> open and closed storage formats (although there’s varying limitations around their write/read support on open formats).</p><p>These are some the main open source file formats for storing data efficiently:</p><ul><li><a href="https://avro.apache.org/?ref=davidgomes.com">Apache Avro</a> — Binary, Rowstore, Files</li><li><a href="https://parquet.apache.org/?ref=davidgomes.com">Apache Parquet</a> — Binary, Columnstore, Files</li><li><a href="https://orc.apache.org/?ref=davidgomes.com">Apache ORC</a> — Binary, Columnstore, Files</li><li><a href="https://arrow.apache.org/?ref=davidgomes.com">Apache Arrow</a> — Binary, Columnstore, In-Memory<ul><li>The best way to store Apache Arrow dataframes in files on disk is with <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/feather.html?ref=davidgomes.com">Feather</a>. However, it’s also possible to convert to Apache Parquet format and others.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://protobuf.dev/?ref=davidgomes.com" rel="noreferrer">Protocol Buffers</a> (Protobuf) — Binary, N/A, In-Memory<ul><li>Protobuf is a language-neutral data structure definition language. Different implementations will store the data differently (it could be row-by-row, i.e., rowstore, or columnstore).</li></ul></li><li>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values?ref=davidgomes.com" rel="noreferrer">CSV</a> — Text, Rowstore/Columnstore, Files)<ul><li>CSV is very different from the others on this list given its structure is extremely trivial. There is, however, a <a href="https://digital-preservation.github.io/csv-schema/?ref=davidgomes.com">"CSV Schema" language</a> definition, but it doesn’t seem to be very popular.</li></ul></li></ul><p>But what do the formats actually imply? <strong>The formats are specifications for how the data should be arranged in actual binary layout.</strong> There is a <a href="https://www.vladsiv.com/big-data-file-formats/?ref=davidgomes.com">really good blog post</a> by Vladimir Sivcevic about Avro vs Parquet vs ORC which explains the layouts ("structure") for each of the file types — I highly recommend reading it. Afterwards, one can understand where the metadata and the actual data should live in the file’s contents, and what the pros/cons of each format are. For instance, Parquet supports really good compression, whereas Avro is more suited for reading specific row blocks (it’s rowstore). However, both support an evolving schema, i.e., the ability to modify the schema of new data without having to rewrite all existing data. In addition, both support file splitting which is essential for parallel processing of data.</p><p>So now we’re starting to understand the most common Big Data file formats. These are really interesting, and you can spend a lot of time studying what makes them so powerful. The main thing to remember, however, is that because they’re open, you can work with these formats from a variety of programming languages and tools. As an example, the <a href="https://github.com/apache/parquet-format?ref=davidgomes.com">Apache Parquet’s repository</a> contains the specification for the actual file format, as well as a reference Java implementation. However, there’s libraries for pretty much every language that allow you to read/write from Parquet files.</p><pre><code>"""
The following is a snippet that writes some sample data to a
Parquet file on local disk. It uses Pandas to achieve that.
"""
&gt;&gt;&gt; import pandas as pd
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Create a Pandas DataFrame with sample data
&gt;&gt;&gt; data = {
...     'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
...     'Age': [25, 30, 35],
...     'City': ['New York', 'San Francisco', 'Los Angeles']
... }
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; df = pd.DataFrame(data)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Write the data frame to a Parquet file
&gt;&gt;&gt; file_path = './sample_table.parquet'
&gt;&gt;&gt; df.to_parquet(file_path, index=False)
</code></pre><p>Presto/Trino, Spark, DuckDB, Hive, Dremio, Impala, AWS Athena and Apache Drill are just some of the engines that can work with Parquet files. I find this fascinating, and I can see how Parquet is very useful for data teams who want to ensure their data can be accessed by many different tools.</p><p>But the file formats are just one layer of the overall data stack. They are helpful for data scientists working on their own, or at a small scale. But by themselves, they don’t really give data engines all they need in order to manage large-scale, evolving datasets. And that’s what higher-level storage layers like the Hive Format, Iceberg and Delta Lake are for.</p><h2 id="data-management-at-scale-%E2%80%94-iceberg-and-delta-lake">Data Management at Scale — Iceberg and Delta Lake</h2><p>So, how can we store many different tables, and evolve the individual schemas of all of these tables, and do things like point-in-time reads, all while partitioning the data efficiently for queries? And how can external tools easily read these schemas? And how should statistics about the data be stored in order to build cost-based query optimizers for this data?</p><p>In order to do all this, we need a higher-level metadata layer around our data files. The file formats described above only specify the layout of one individual file. So, we need a table format of sorts, as well as a schema registry that allows tools to introspect any metadata about our datasets. One example of a schema registry is <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html?ref=davidgomes.com" rel="noreferrer">Confluent Schema Registry</a>, which supports Avro and Protobuf, as it is more suited for streaming data which tends to be rowstore.</p><p>When it comes to columnar data, in 2009, <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2009/06/10/web/hive-a-petabyte-scale-data-warehouse-using-hadoop/?ref=davidgomes.com">Facebook launched Hive</a> with its own table metadata format (it now supports multiple formats though). Then, over the years, Netflix developed Iceberg to overcome some of Hive’s limitations, specifically around performance and scalability (I highly recommend going into the "Sources" section below for the historical context here). And then Databricks developed and eventually open sourced Delta Lake, which is an alternative to Iceberg. And both Iceberg and Delta Lake use Parquet as their individual file format! Hive, Delta Lake and Iceberg all support support of schema registry or metastore. In Hive, the HMS (Hive MetaStore), can be pretty much any RDBMS. Of course, Iceberg and Delta Lake have similar concepts (<a href="https://iceberg.apache.org/concepts/catalog/?ref=davidgomes.com" rel="noreferrer">Iceberg Catalogs</a>, <a href="https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog?ref=davidgomes.com" rel="noreferrer">Unity Catalog</a>) — and these even allow organizations to manage governance for their data (i.e., who or which teams can access which tables).</p><p>I’m not going to go into the differences between Delta Lake and Iceberg. They essentially solve the same problems, in different ways. There’s also a lot of debate around how "open" Delta Lake is, given its development is not as diverse in terms of contributors as Iceberg’s. And the support for Iceberg across popular data warehouses, and lakehouses is growing very quickly — in the last few years, a lot of different providers announced support for Iceberg (Redshift, BigQuery, Snowflake, Athena, Dremio, etc.).</p><p><strong>The important thing to remember is that neither Delta Lake nor Iceberg are query or storage engines in of themselves.</strong> Instead, they’re open specifications that allow query engines to do their job. And they <em>enable</em> a lot of features such as:</p><ul><li>Partitioning<ul><li>In specific, Iceberg supports partitioning evolution. This means that you can change the partitioning scheme (or shard key) of a table without rewriting all the existing data. This was a huge painpoint at Netflix and it was one of the reasons they created Iceberg.</li></ul></li><li>Schema Evolution</li><li>Data Compression</li><li>ACID Transactions around schema changes</li><li>Efficient Query Optimization (things like column pruning, predicate pushdown, and statistics collection to accelerate queries)</li><li>Time travel (point in time queries)</li><li>…</li></ul><p>I studied the Iceberg specification, and I am extremely impressed by its design. It is no wonder that it is becoming extremely popular as a supported format by so many different systems. This will certainly drive products which operate on closed formats to be as performant as possible on their own formats, and to somehow support Iceberg/Delta Lake. However, there's no going back now — Iceberg will become a "checkbox feature", and all database systems will have to support it sooner or later. And can Iceberg eventually replace the closed data formats? This is more complicated, and it probably won't happen due to performance reasons. The truth is that developing a data format for a single query engine, which again only has to operate on that one data format, gives database developers the ability to extract maximum efficiency and innovate more quickly. But who knows!</p><h2 id="and-so-what-are-data-lakes-and-data-lakehouses">And so, what are Data Lakes and Data Lakehouses?</h2><p>Both of these terms have always been a bit confusing to me, but I’m starting to understand them better now.</p><p>So, a Data Lake is where companies store their large amounts of data in some raw format like OCR or Parquet, or even CSV files (picture an S3 bucket with lots of these files). This is different from a Data Warehouse where companies are storing this data in a more structured way (schematized SQL tables and database schemas). And Data Lakehouses are basically the conjunction between a Data Lake, and the ability to do things like running SQL queries, running batch jobs, and setting up data governance schemes. These can now be built on top of a Data Lake with Iceberg together with some query engine and other "add-ons", whereas before you’d need to adopt a Data Warehouse (or a more classic DMBS) to do these things.</p><p>Data Lakehouses leverage some sort of scalable storage as the location for all the data (HDFS or a Cloud Blob Store like S3). And they’ve optimized their query engines to be very fast on these storage engines. The idea, then, is that data lakehouses are basically the open version of a data warehouse. And finally, some examples of Data Lakehouse products are Databricks and Dremio.</p><p>However, I think the line between a Data Warehouse and a Data Lakehouse is becoming more blurry as certain warehouses such as Snowflake and BigQuery add support for open data formats like Iceberg. This will be very interesting to observe over the years to come!</p><h2 id="that%E2%80%99s-it">That’s it!</h2><p>Thank you for sticking around — hopefully the "Sources" section below is also interesting. I certainly learnt a lot while writing this blog post, as I wrote it for myself more than anything else.
