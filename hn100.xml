<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><i></i> Published: 14/11/2025 <br> <i></i> 6 minute read</p><h2 id="i-can-t-recommend-grafana-anymore">I can’t recommend Grafana anymore</h2><hr><blockquote><p><strong><em>Disclaimer:</em></strong> This tells my personal experiences with Grafana products. It also incudes some facts but your experience may entirely vary and I would love to here your take.</p></blockquote><hr><p>I started my work life at a small software company near my university. They develop, run websites and operate web services for multiple clients. Everyone had multiple responsibilities, and they heavily relied on interns and freshmen—which can be both bad and good.<br> For me it was good because I learned a lot.</p><p>At some point we needed a monitoring solution, and Zabbix didn’t fit well into the new and declarative world of containers and Docker. I was tasked to find a solution. I looked at Loki/Prometheus with Grafana and Elastic with Kibana. Elastic was a beast! Heavy, hard to run, resource-hungry, and complex, Loki and Prometheus were the perfect fit back then.</p><p>So I created a <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> with Loki, Prometheus and Grafana. Since they all had the internal Docker network, we required no auth between them. Grafana was only exposed over an SSH tunnel. One static scrape config and the Docker Loki log plugin later, we had our observability stack. For non-Docker logs, we used Promtail. Loki and Prometheus stayed on the same machine and all we required was a local volume mount. Load was minimal.</p><blockquote><p>ℹ️ This is when I learned that you should not transform every log parameter to an label just to make it easier to select in the Grafana UI. Having a label for latency with basically limitless values will fill every disks inodes, thats just how Cortex bin-packs.</p></blockquote><p>I also found out Grafana Labs has a cloud offering with a nice free tier. So I even used this for personal stuff. I had a good experience with them.</p><p>Time goes on, and I switched jobs. Now we have Kubernetes.<br> The Prometheus container was now switching nodes. Roming storage was a problem back then, and also our workload increased by a lot. We also needed long-term storage (13 months). So I looked around and found Thanos and Mimir.<br> Previous experiences with Grafana products were good, so I chose Mimir. Should be similar to Loki since both are based on Cortex. Now we didn’t really need Prometheus anymore. We were only using <code>remote_write</code> from Prometheus. Grafana had a solution for this. With the Grafana Agent, you can ship both logs and metrics to a remote location all in one binary. This seemed like a no-brainer.</p><p>Time goes on, and Grafana changed the Grafana Agent setup to Grafana Agent Flow Mode—some adjustments, but okay - software changes. And man, did Grafana like to change things.</p><p>They started to build their own observability platform to steal some of DataDogs customers. They created Grafana OnCall their own notification system. Not only that, but they heavily invested in Helm charts and general starter templates. Basically two commands to install the metric/log shippers and use Grafana Cloud. And even when you don’t want or can’t use Grafana Cloud, here are the Helm charts to install Mimir/Loki/Tempo. To make things even easier, let’s all put it in an umbrella chart (it renders to 6k lines in the default state). Or use their Grafana Operator to manage Grafana installs - or at least parts of it.</p><p>As many may have experienced, software maintenance shows with age.<br> Grafana OnCall is deprecated, and Grafana Agent and Agent Flow were deprecated within 2-3 years of their creation. Some of the <em>easy to use</em> Helm charts are not maintained anymore. They also deprecated Angular within Grafana and switched to React for dashboards. This broke most existing dashboards.</p><p>On the same day they deprecated the Grafana Agent, they announced Grafana Alloy. The all in one replacement. It can do Logs, Metrics, Traces (zipkin &amp; jaeger) and OTEL. The solution for everything!<br> The solution kind of had a rough start and was a <em>little</em> buggy. But it got better over time. The Alloy Operator also entered the game because why not.</p><blockquote><p>ℹ️ They choose to use their own configuration language for alloy. Something that looks like HCL. I can understand why thy didn’t want to use YAML but I’m still not a fan of this. Not everything needs their own DSL.</p></blockquote><p>Happy End, right? &nbsp;- Not quite<br> The all-in-one solution does not support everything. While Grafana built their own monitoring empire, the kube-prometheus community consistently and naturally developed. The Prometheus Operator with <code>ServiceMonitor</code> and <code>PodMonitor</code> CRDs became the defacto standards. So Alloy also supports the <code>monitoring.coreos.com</code> api-group CRDs, at least some parts of it. It natively works with <code>ServiceMonitor</code> and <code>PodMonitor</code>, but <code>PrometheusRules</code> needs extra configuration. The <code>AlertmanagerConfig</code> which would need to be implemented in Mimir is not supported. Because Mimir brings its own Alertmanager - at least sort of. There are version differences and small incompatibilities. &nbsp;</p><p>But I got it all working; now I can finally stop explaining to my boss why we need to re-structure the monitoring stack every year.</p><p>Grafana just released Mimir 3.0. They re-architected the ingestion logic for scalability, and now they use a message broker. Yes, Mimir in version 3.0 needs Apache Kafka to work.<br> None of the above things alone would be a reason to ditch Grafana products. Set aside the fact that they made it incredibly difficult now to find the ingestion endpoints for Grafana Cloud since they want to push users to use their new fleet-config management service. But all this together makes me uncomfortable recommending Grafana stuff.<br> I just don’t know what will change next.</p><p>I want stability for my monitoring; I want it boring, and that’s something Grafana is not offering. &nbsp; It seems like the pace within Grafana is way too fast for many companies, and I know for a fact that that pace is partially driven by career-driven development. There are some smart people at Grafana but not every customer is smart nor has the capacity to make Grafana their priority number one. Complexity kills - we’ve seen this.</p><blockquote><p>ℹ️ Don’t get me wrong. Mimir, Loki and Grafana are technically really good software products and I (mostly) still like them but it’s the way these products are managed which makes me question them.</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes I wonder how I would see this if I had chosen the ELK stack at my first job. I also wonder if the OpenShift approach (kube-prometheus-stack) with Thanos for long-term storage is the most time-stable solution. &nbsp; I just hope OTEL settles, gets stable and boring fast, and just lets me pick whatever I want for my backend. Because right now I’m done with monitoring. I just want to support our application and do not want to revisit the monitoring setup every x weeks, because monitoring is a necessity—not the product. At least for most companies.</p></article></div>]]></description>

How do we lead AI developers to do what the hardware prefers?</p>
<p>AMD GPUs are now offering state-of-the-art speeds and feeds. However, this performance is locked away from AI workflows due to the <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2025-11-09-hk">lack of mature AMD software</a>. We share HipKittens, an opinionated collection of programming primitives to help developers realize the hardware's capabilities: optimized register tiles, 8-wave and 4-wave kernel patterns instead of wave-specialization to schedule work within processors, and chiplet-optimized cache reuse patterns to schedule work across processors.</p>
<p>Checkout <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2025-11-09-hk">part one of this series</a> for an intro to HipKittens and checkout this post for a technical deep dive.</p>
<h3>What do AMD CDNA GPUs look like? A lay of the land.</h3>
<p>An AMD MI355X GPU has 256 processors called “compute units” (CUs) and a CU contains four SIMDs. A SIMD has different execution units. A 64-thread “wave” (contrasting a 32-thread warp on NVIDIA) occupies a single SIMD. We show the MI355X memory hierarchy below.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, making AMD GPUs go brr boils down to keeping the “matrix cores” (tensor cores on NVIDIA) fed. There are a few differences in how we think about this hardware:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What it's not.</strong> An MI355X has 70% the SRAM of a B200 (165KB instead of 228KB), lacks asynchronous matrix multiplication instructions that operate on inputs in shared or tensor memory (wgmma, tcgen05), lacks register reallocation (the ability for some waves to give their registers to others), lacks tensor memory acceleration (dedicated hardware for global memory access), and lacks first class mbarrier primitives (for fine-grained synchronization).</li>
<li><strong>What it is.</strong> On the other hand, AMD GPUs have a 2x larger register file per processor than the B200 and offers 60% more processors per GPU (256 compute units versus 160 streaming multiprocessors). AMD offers tiny and fine-grained matrix core instructions, while NVIDIA tensor cores instructions are generally called with large input operands. AMD has a TMA-like direct global to shared memory loads via <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">buffer_load_dword</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|buffer_load_dword|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> instructions, which bypass the register file.</li>
<li><strong>Towards chiplet architectures.</strong> AMD is also leading the charge in the shift from monolithic grids to chiplets. AMD splits the 256 processors into 8 chiplets called “XCDs” of 32 CUs. NVIDIA B200s include 2 chips. The AMD cache is disaggregated: an AMD XCD has a private L2 cache and there is an extra last level cache (LLC) that sits between the L2 and HBM memory.</li>
</ol>

<p>These differences impact the ways in which we design kernels on AMD.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Optimized memory access:</strong> Of course this matters on NVIDIA, but AMD’s layouts, HIPCC compiler limitations, and (undocumented) quirky behaviors of different I/O instructions yields new challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Scheduling within processors:</strong> We need to rely on our register file and small matrix core instructions instead of shared memory and bulky wgmma/tcgen05 instructions to establish deep pipelines and hide memory costs. Wave specialization / producer consumer, which reigns supreme in NVIDIA kernels, is not the right answer on AMD.</li>
<li><strong>Scheduling across processors:</strong> We need to start thinking about NUMA effects at the cache level as we schedule work across thread blocks.</li>
</ol>
<p>We walk through these three topics next.</p>
<h3>HipKittens memory access patterns</h3>
<p>As in <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2024-05-12-tk">ThunderKittens</a>, in HK, developers program using tiles as the basic data structure. Tiles exist in shared or register memory, and are parametrized by a data type, size dimensions (a multiple of the matrix core instruction shape), and layout. HK provides a library of PyTorch-like functions that operate on tiles, for instance <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">exp</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|exp|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">mma</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|mma|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">sub</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|sub|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">add</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|add|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">row_max</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|row_max|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> compute ops and load, store memory ops. A tile is collectively owned by threads in a wave (warp). The functions use template metaprogramming to generalize to different input tiles and are lightweight, directly wrapping assembly (PTX, CDNA ISA) and C++.</p>
<p>A memory layout determines how data elements map to thread ownership. A matrix core instruction expects a particular register layout depending on the data type and instruction shape. We also want to maximize the granularity and coalescing of global memory loads. Between registers and HBM, shared memory is split into banks (4-byte regions) that can serve data simultaneously. If threads from a wave request data from the same bank at the same time, their accesses are serialized; efficient kernels use “swizzle patterns” to organize data in a way that avoids these bank conflicts.</p>
<p>A few challenges for memory access in HK include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Register scheduling:</strong> A core tenant of HK and TK is to give developers full control over register allocation by remaining C++ embedded. Compilers like Triton prevent register management altogether, but surprisingly we find that even the HIPCC compiler imposes severe limitations (no wonder AMD uses raw assembly!).<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> For instance, 4-wave (1-wave per SIMD) kernels compiled via HIPCC cannot use data held in certain types of registers as inputs to matrix instructions. This motivated us to add explicit register scheduling to HK, where developers pin specific registers when creating registers tiles, effectively replacing the compiler’s register management capabilities. Developers thus have the control necessary to write peak performance kernels!</li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Learn more about explicit register scheduling</summary><p>When a single wave is mapped per SIMD, the 512 registers are actually divided into 256 accumulator general purpose registers (AGPRs) and 256 vector general purpose registers (VGPRs). AGPRs have fundamental hardware limitations (e.g., vector arithmetic instructions cannot operate on them), but they can still crucially serve as the input or outputs for MFMA instructions. HIPCC, however, cannot generate code that uses AGPRs as input to MFMA instructions, leading to inefficient register management for register heavy workloads and redundant accvgpr_read/write instructions that move data between VGPRs and AGPRs.</p></details>
<ul>
<li><strong>Register layouts</strong>: NVIDIA tensor core layouts are regular – as we vary the data type or matrix shape, the layout is composed of an underlying “core matrix” structure. Thus, frameworks like TK and Gluon can apply a unified swizzling rule to avoid bank conflicts. However, AMD layouts differ significantly based on the data type and matrix shape. In fact, we show that it’s not possible to use a single swizzle pattern for all layouts. Further, sometimes we want to use multiple matrix shapes within the same kernel meaning that our swizzle pattern needs to be compatible with multiple types of layouts concurrently.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/static/posts/2025-11-09-amd-brr/matrix.png"><figcaption><p>Figure: AMD register layouts for matrix instructions are less structured. NVIDIA layouts are all composed from an underlying core matrix structure.</p></figcaption></figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instruction phases:</strong> Waves (and NVIDIA warps) execute shared memory read/write instructions <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/how-to-understand-the-bank-conflict-of-shared-mem/260900">in phases</a>, where a subset of threads in the wave access shared memory concurrently. NVIDIA instructions sequentially assign threads to phases (e.g., threads 0-7 in phase one, 8-15 in phase two). However, the phase groups are both non-sequential and differ entirely based on AMD CDNA memory instruction. For example, we found that a <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">ds_read_b128</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|ds_read_b128|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> instruction reading 128 bits for each thread executes across 4 phases and has access to 64 banks. On the other hand, a <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">ds_write_b64</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|ds_write_b64|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> instruction writing 64 bits for each thread executes across 4 phases and has access to only 32 banks. This behavior is not well-documented even within AMD(! 😔), so we created and release solvers that reverse-engineer this behavior.</li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Learn why we can't use a single swizzle pattern for all AMD layouts.</summary><p>Proof by contradiction:</p><p>To show why a single swizzling pattern is insufficient across different register tile
shapes and layouts on AMD GPUs, consider the following two access patterns that surface in attention backwards:</p><ol>
<li>A row-layout 16x16 bf16 tile is written to shared memory. For this tile configuration, each thread holds 4 contiguous bf16 values - 64 bits in memory - and the most optimal instruction to issue this write is <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">ds_write_b64</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|ds_write_b64|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>. Avoiding bank conflicts for this access requires a swizzle pattern that respects the phase ordering and bank behavior previously mentioned. In this case, a swizzle that abides by these constraints is computed as <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">f</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">f</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">s</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{offset}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> ^ <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>=</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">f</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">f</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">s</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi><mn>512</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>&gt;</mo><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>7</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>&lt;</mo><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">= ((\mathrm{offset} \% 512) &gt;&gt; 7) &lt;&lt; 3</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, where 64-bit chunks of memory is shifted around memory using an XOR swizzle.</li>
<li>A row-layout 16x32 bf16 tile is read from shared memory. For this tile, each thread holds 8 contiguous bf16 values - 128 bits in memory - and the most optimal instruction to issue this read is <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">ds_read_b128</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|ds_read_b128|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.</li>
</ol><p>Regardless of the swizzling pattern required for <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">ds_read_b128</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|ds_read_b128|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, the granularities of these two instructions are in conflict with each other. <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">ds_read_b128</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|ds_read_b128|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> requires at least 128 bits of memory to be contiguous in shared memory, and the swizzle pattern for <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="monospace">ds_write_b64</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\verb|ds_write_b64|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> breaks apart memory into 64-bit chunks. As a result, different swizzling patterns need to be used for each.</p></details>
<ul>
<li><strong>Address generation:</strong> AMD GPUs support direct asynchronous HBM to shared memory loads. Like TMA, these loads bypass the register file. The instruction takes as input per-thread addresses in HBM from which each thread will read data. While DSLs like TK directly swizzle the shared memory addresses, swizzling shared memory on AMD is instead accomplished by swizzling on the HBM addresses.</li>
</ul>
<p>We provide developers with optimized tile layouts and memory access patterns by default within HK. Checkout our paper to learn more about how we implement solutions to the above challenges.</p>
<h3>HipKittens schedules within a processor</h3>
<p>Ideally we would have simple, reusable patterns for scheduling the compute and memory within kernels that generalize across AI workloads. Wave specialization / producer consumer serves this purpose on NVIDIA, but what about on AMD?</p>
<p><strong>Wave specialization struggles on AMD.</strong> Wave specialization is the dominant paradigm for achieving high occupancy on modern NVIDIA GPUs. Producer waves focus on memory movement while consumer waves focus on computation. This strategy underpins today’s state-of-the-art AI kernels—including <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08608">FlashAttention-3</a>, <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=fGgQS5VW09">COMET for MOE models</a>, and <a href="https://research.colfax-intl.com/nvidia-hopper-gemm-cutlass/">high-performance GEMMs</a> —as well as kernel DSLs such as <a href="https://github.com/HazyResearch/ThunderKittens/blob/main/kernels/matmul/H100/matmul.cu">ThunderKittens LSCF</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17577">TileLang</a>.</p>
<p>But, we show that wave specialization underperforms on AMD due to the lack of register reallocation. On the MI355X, registers are statically divided across all waves. Producer waves that only need a few registers for address calculation are allocated more registers than they need; consumer waves cannot recoup those registers and must either spill registers to scratch memory or run at a lower arithmetic intensity. Both are disastrous for performance. Wave specialization limits the output tile size and makes our kernels more memory bound.  For GEMMs, data loaded from memory is O(MK + NK) while compute is O(MNK). Decreasing the M or N in our per thread block output tile size lowers arithmetic intensity.

<p>Scheduling patterns for AMD. Our attempt to use wave specialization - a strategy that works well on NVIDIA GPUs - did not yield the expected speedups on AMD hardware. All is not lost! We found two scheduling patterns that consistently yield high occupancy AMD GPUs, while using tile programming primitives (no raw assembly)!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>8-wave ping-pong:</strong> We assign two waves per SIMD and at any given time, one is executing a cluster of memory instructions while the other wave executes a cluster of compute instructions. The waves swap at the end of cluster execution. With this approach, the developer can use large HK tiles since a thread issues many of the same instructions at once!</li>
<li><strong>4-wave interleave:</strong> We assign one wave per SIMD and threads in this wave finely switch between issuing memory and compute operations. Here, the developer uses small HK tiles (essentially matching the size of the matrix core instruction shape) to achieve the fine-grained schedule.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two patterns tradeoff programmability and performance, where 8-wave and its large tile primitives lead to compact code and 4-wave fine-grained interleaving expands code size. Surprisingly, the 8-wave schedule is sufficient to achieve SoTA-level performance on GEMMs and attention forwards. For GQA non-causal attention backwards, 8-wave also outperforms all AMD baselines by <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1.8</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1.8\times</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, and our HK 4-wave further outperforms by <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2.3</mn><mo>×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2.3\times</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.</p>

<h3>HipKittens schedules across processors</h3>
<p>Modern GPUs are moving toward chiplet-based architectures, shifting away from traditional monolithic dies. AMD’s MI355X, for instance, integrates eight chiplets (XCDs), each with its own L2 cache, while NVIDIA’s B200 pairs two dies together. This shift enables higher scalability and yield but introduces a new performance challenge: disaggregated memory hierarchies. Each cluster of compute units now has local caches, and memory locality is no longer uniform across the chip.</p>
<p>On AMD GPUs, thread blocks are scheduled to chiplets in a round-robin fashion, meaning that the order in which blocks are launched—the grid schedule—directly affects how effectively data is reused in cache. Even perfectly tuned kernels can lose bandwidth if their grid layout is cache-unfriendly.</p>

When thread blocks are scheduled in naíve row-major order, cache reuse is suboptimal (<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>≈</mo><mn>55</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\approx55\%</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>) because blocks that share the same L2 cache often load different, non-overlapping tiles of A and B. Further, optimizing purely for L2 locality can cause each XCD to fetch disjoint portions of A and B, leading to redundant loads at the next cache level.</p>
<p>To address this, HipKittens introduces a chiplet-aware scheduling strategy that reorganizes the grid launch order to better exploit locality at both the L2 (per-chiplet) and LLC (shared) cache levels for GEMM workloads. The key idea is to group thread blocks that operate on nearby regions of the output matrix so that they naturally reuse overlapping tiles of input data across cache hierarchies.</p>
<h3>Putting it all together</h3>
<p>Let's take a look at a few kernels written in HK.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, here's the hot loop of our attention forwards pass kernel (the entire kernel is <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>≈</mo><mn>500</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\approx 500</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> lines of code). We can see that the kernel uses HK's 8-wave ping pong schedule where waves alternate between compute instruction clusters and memory clusters.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>Here's the core hot loop structure for our BF16 GEMM kernel. Again, we can see that waves alternate between compute clusters and memory clusters using HK's 8-wave ping pong schedule.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Multi-silicon AI is coming!</h3>
<p>HipKittens delivers competitive performance on AMD CDNA3 and CDNA4 through three key insights: optimized memory access, AMD-centric wave scheduling patterns within a processor, and chiplet-aware grid scheduling across processors to exploits AMD's disaggregated cache hierarchy. Our kernels consistently achieve peak performance amongst AMD baselines across workloads (and compete with peak Blackwell kernels as well).</p>
<p>Realizing AI's full potential requires diverse, open hardware.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> Today, that means making AMD GPUs truly accessible.</p>
<p>We want more AI in the world. AI has relied on and innovated on a single hardware provider, but we need to be able to use and experiment with all the compute we can. We need to be able to use the fastest hardware out there. We’re happy to help address these problems with HipKittens!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This past Monday, November 10th, we celebrated the 16th anniversary of Go’s
<a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2009/11/hey-ho-lets-go.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">open source
release</a>!</p>
<p>We released <a href="https://go.dev/blog/go1.24">Go 1.24 in February</a> and <a href="https://go.dev/blog/go1.25">Go 1.25 in
August</a>, following our now well-established and dependable release
cadence. Continuing our mission to build the most productive language platform
for building production systems, these releases included new APIs for building
robust and reliable software, significant advances in Go’s track record for
building secure software, and some serious under-the-hood improvements.
Meanwhile, no one can ignore the seismic shifts in our industry brought by
generative AI. The Go team is applying its thoughtful and uncompromising mindset
to the problems and opportunities of this dynamic space, working to bring Go’s
production-ready approach to building robust AI integrations, products, agents,
and infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="core-language-and-library-improvements">Core language and library improvements</h2>
<p>First released in Go 1.24 as an experiment and then graduated in Go 1.25, the
new <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/testing/synctest" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>testing/synctest</code></a> package
significantly simplifies writing tests for <a href="https://go.dev/blog/testing-time">concurrent, asynchronous
code</a>. Such code is particularly common in network services,
and is traditionally very hard to test well. The <code>synctest</code> package works by
virtualizing time itself. It takes tests that used to be slow, flaky, or both,
and makes them easy to rewrite into reliable and nearly instantaneous tests,
often with just a couple extra lines of code. It’s also a great example of Go’s
integrated approach to software development: behind an almost trivial API, the
<code>synctest</code> package hides a deep integration with the Go runtime and other parts
of the standard library.</p>
<p>This isn’t the only boost the <code>testing</code> package got over the past year. The new
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/testing#B.Loop" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>testing.B.Loop</code></a> API is both easier to use
than the original <code>testing.B.N</code> API and addresses many of the traditional—and
often invisible!—<a href="https://go.dev/blog/testing-b-loop">pitfalls</a> of writing Go benchmarks. The
<code>testing</code> package also has new APIs that <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/testing#T.Context" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">make it easy to
cleanup</a> in tests that use
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/context#Context" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>Context</code></a>, and that <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/testing#T.Output" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">make it
easy</a> to write to the test’s log.</p>
<p>Go and containerization grew up together and work great with each other. Go 1.25
launched <a href="https://go.dev/blog/container-aware-gomaxprocs">container-aware scheduling</a>, making
this pairing even stronger. Without developers having to lift a finger, this
transparently adjusts the parallelism of Go workloads running in containers,
preventing CPU throttling that can impact tail latency and improving Go’s
out-of-the-box production-readiness.</p>
<p>Go 1.25’s new <a href="https://go.dev/blog/flight-recorder">flight recorder</a> builds on our already
powerful execution tracer, enabling deep insights into the dynamic behavior of
production systems. While the execution tracer generally collected <em>too much</em>
information to be practical in long-running production services, the flight
recorder is like a little time machine, allowing a service to snapshot recent
events in great detail <em>after</em> something has gone wrong.</p>
<h2 id="secure-software-development">Secure software development</h2>
<p>Go continues to strengthen its commitment to secure software development, making
significant strides in its native cryptography packages and evolving its
standard library for enhanced safety.</p>
<p>Go ships with a full suite of native cryptography packages in the standard
library, which reached two major milestones over the past year. A security
audit conducted by independent security firm <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Trail of
Bits</a> yielded <a href="https://go.dev/blog/tob-crypto-audit">excellent
results</a>, with only a single low-severity finding.
Furthermore, through a collaborative effort between the Go Security Team and
<a href="https://geomys.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Geomys</a>, these packages achieved CAVP certification,
paving the way for <a href="https://go.dev/blog/fips140">full FIPS 140-3 certification</a>. This is a
vital development for Go users in certain regulated environments. FIPS 140
compliance, previously a source of friction due to the need for unsupported
solutions, will now be seamlessly integrated, addressing concerns related to
safety, developer experience, functionality, release velocity, and compliance.</p>
<p>The Go standard library has continued to evolve to be <em>safe by default</em> and
<em>safe by design</em>. For example, the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/os#Root" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>os.Root</code></a>
API—added in Go 1.24—enables <a href="https://go.dev/blog/osroot">traversal-resistant file system
access</a>, effectively combating a class of vulnerabilities where an
attacker could manipulate programs into accessing files intended to be
inaccessible. Such vulnerabilities are notoriously challenging to address
without underlying platform and operating system support, and the new
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/os#Root" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>os.Root</code></a> API offers a straightforward,
consistent, and portable solution.</p>
<h2 id="under-the-hood-improvements">Under-the-hood improvements</h2>
<p>In addition to user-visible changes, Go has made significant improvements under
the hood over the past year.</p>
<p>For Go 1.24, we completely <a href="https://go.dev/blog/swisstable">redesigned the <code>map</code>
implementation</a>, building on the latest and greatest ideas in
hash table design. This change is completely transparent, and brings significant
improvements to <code>map</code> performance, lower tail latency of <code>map</code> operations, and
in some cases even significant memory wins.</p>
<p>Go 1.25 includes an experimental and significant advancement in Go’s garbage
collector called <a href="https://go.dev/blog/greenteagc">Green Tea</a>. Green Tea reduces garbage
collection overhead in many applications by at least 10% and sometimes as much
as 40%. It uses a novel algorithm designed for the capabilities and constraints
of today’s hardware and opens up a new design space that we’re eagerly
exploring. For example, in the forthcoming Go 1.26 release, Green Tea will
achieve an additional 10% reduction in garbage collector overhead on hardware
that supports AVX-512 vector instructions—something that would have been nigh
impossible to take advantage of in the old algorithm. Green Tea will be enabled
by default in Go 1.26; users need only upgrade their Go version to benefit.</p>
<h2 id="furthering-the-software-development-stack">Furthering the software development stack</h2>
<p>Go is about far more than the language and standard library. It’s a software
development platform, and over the past year, we’ve also made four regular
releases of the <a href="https://go.dev/gopls">gopls language server</a>, and have formed partnerships to
support emerging new frameworks for agentic applications.</p>
<p>Gopls provides Go support to VS Code and other LSP-powered editors and IDEs.
Every release sees a litany of features and improvements to the experience of
reading and writing Go code (see the <a href="https://go.dev/gopls/release/v0.17.0">v0.17.0</a>,
<a href="https://go.dev/gopls/release/v0.18.0">v0.18.0</a>, <a href="https://go.dev/gopls/release/v0.19.0">v0.19.0</a>, and
<a href="https://go.dev/gopls/release/v0.20.0">v0.20.0</a> release notes for full details, or our new
<a href="https://go.dev/gopls/features">gopls feature documentation</a>!). Some highlights include many
new and enhanced analyzers to help developers write more idiomatic and robust Go
code; refactoring support for variable extraction, variable inlining, and JSON
struct tags; and an <a href="https://go.dev/gopls/features/mcp">experimental built-in server</a> for the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) that exposes a subset of gopls’ functionality to AI
assistants in the form of MCP tools.</p>
<p>With gopls v0.18.0, we began exploring <em>automatic code modernizers</em>. As Go
evolves, every release brings new capabilities and new idioms; new and better
ways to do things that Go programmers have been finding other ways to do. Go
stands by its <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1compat">compatibility promise</a>—the old way will continue
to work in perpetuity—but nevertheless this creates a bifurcation between old
idioms and new idioms. Modernizers are static analysis tools that recognize old
idioms and suggest faster, more readable, more secure, more <em>modern</em>
replacements, and do so with push-button reliability. What <code>gofmt</code> did for
<a href="https://go.dev/blog/gofmt">stylistic consistency</a>, we hope modernizers can do for idiomatic
consistency. We’ve integrated modernizers as IDE suggestions, where they can
help developers not only maintain more consistent coding standards, but where we
believe they will help developers discover new features and keep up with the
state of the art. We believe modernizers can also help AI coding assistants keep
up with the state of the art and combat their proclivity to reinforce outdated
knowledge of the Go language, APIs, and idioms. The upcoming Go 1.26 release
will include a total overhaul of the long-dormant <code>go fix</code> command to make it
apply the full suite of modernizers in bulk, a return to its <a href="https://go.dev/blog/introducing-gofix">pre-Go 1.0
roots</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of September, in collaboration with
<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Anthropic</a> and the Go community, we released
<a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/releases/tag/v1.0.0" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">v1.0.0</a> of
the <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">official Go SDK</a> for the
<a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a>. This SDK
supports both MCP clients and MCP servers, and underpins the new MCP
functionality in gopls. Contributing this work in open source helps empower
other areas of the growing open source agentic ecosystem built around Go, such
as the recently released <a href="https://github.com/google/adk-go" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Agent Development Kit (ADK) for
Go</a> from <a href="https://www.google.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Google</a>.
ADK Go builds on the Go MCP SDK to provide an idiomatic framework for building
modular multi-agent applications and systems. The Go MCP SDK and ADK Go
demonstrate how Go’s unique strengths in concurrency, performance, and
reliability differentiate Go for production AI development and we are expecting
more AI workloads to be written in Go in the coming years.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2>
<p>Go has an exciting year ahead of it.</p>
<p>We’re working on advancing developer productivity through the brand new <code>go fix</code>
command, deeper support for AI coding assistants, and ongoing improvements to
gopls and VS Code Go. General availability of the Green Tea garbage collector,
native support for Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) hardware features,
and runtime and standard library support for writing code that scales even
better to massive multicore hardware will continue to align Go with modern
hardware and improve production efficiency. We’re focusing on Go’s “production
stack” libraries and diagnostics, including a massive (and long in the making)
<a href="https://go.dev/issue/71497">upgrade to <code>encoding/json</code></a>, driven by Joe Tsai and people across
the Go community; <a href="https://go.dev/design/74609-goroutine-leak-detection-gc">leaked goroutine
profiling</a>, contributed by
<a href="https://www.uber.com/us/en/about/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Uber’s</a> Programming Systems team; and many
other improvements to <code>net/http</code>, <code>unicode</code>, and other foundational packages.
We’re working to provide well-lit paths for building with Go and AI, evolving
the language platform with care for the evolving needs of today’s developers,
and building tools and capabilities that help both human developers and AI
assistants and systems alike.</p>
<p>On this 16th anniversary of Go’s open source release, we’re also looking to the
future of the Go open source project itself. From its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwoWei-GAPo" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">humble
beginnings</a>, Go has formed a
thriving contributor community. To continue to best meet the needs of our
ever-expanding user base, especially in a time of upheaval in the software
industry, we’re working on ways to better scale Go’s development
processes—without losing sight of Go’s fundamental principles—and more deeply
involve our wonderful contributor community.</p>
<p>Go would not be where it is today without our incredible user and contributor
communities. We wish you all the best in the coming year!</p>

  <p><strong>Granny won me over with the government cheese.</strong> As a child, maybe 4 or 5 years old, when I’d visit her on occasional Sundays in Blue Ridge, Georgia, she’d slice me off a little treat — an orange rectangle from a brown cardboard box in the refrigerator. We would sit around her kitchen table, where she held court with my aunts by telling stories and making plans for canning vegetables. Sometimes the aunts smoked cigarettes, which they’d quickly stamp out when my preacher-grandfather came around the corner. Nevermind that my snack was processed and inexpensive, a generic type of Velveeta. In those days at Granny’s, sitting with my cheese and the grown-ups in our rural mountain town, I might as well have been tasting Camembert on the banks of the Seine.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevermind, too, the Mason jars of homemade soup on her shelves, a kaleidoscope of summer’s bounty — tomatoes, okra, corn — put up and waiting to take the chill off colder days. Nevermind the freshly baked pound cakes under Tupperware domes like trophies, which she kept atop the washing machine, also in the kitchen, or the biscuits she could whip up with nary a measuring device or recipe. I would learn to appreciate all those later. As a kid, the cheese wowed me.&nbsp;</p><p>My mother tried to explain that it was a commodity provided by government funding for the school cafeteria where my grandmother worked. “Maybe you shouldn’t mention the cheese,” Mom said recently, when I told her about writing this story. She has a good point. Folks don’t like to hear the words <em>processed</em> and <em>school food</em> in the same sentence. And Mom wouldn’t want people to think Granny was somehow taking advantage of the system. But don’t worry, Mom. The cheese is part of the point. I want people to know how Granny believed in wasting nothing, in sharing everything. In cooking from scratch as often as possible but also making do with every resource provided to her. And, yes, she sometimes had leftover cheese at home, but she also got in trouble for sneaking extra food into the paper sacks of kids without lunch money or even handing food out the back of the lunchroom screen door. “Situational ethics,” my cousin Susie calls it. I’d come to understand all that later. But as a kid, I just knew Granny’s job was cool.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Beulah Culpepper, </strong>the writer’s grandmother, was married to Rev. Paul Culpepper and spent her early years at home in the Georgia mountains, taking care of their eight children. At age 43, she began her food service career at Blue Ridge Elementary where, for about three decades, she found a sort of ministry of her own — making sure kids were well fed.</p>

  <p>Beulah Culpepper started work as an assistant lunch lady at Blue Ridge Elementary School in 1950 at age 43. That’s after she’d had eight kids of her own, whom she raised by home cooking, pickling, canning, and keeping chickens. She married young, after a rough childhood. My grandparents held a small ceremony on the railroad tracks outside the textile plant where they’d met. My grandfather called her Sunshine. And, for the outsized proportion of his noggin, she called him Fathead. She never learned to drive, and she only had a third-grade education. But when my father, her youngest, started school, she decided she was going with him. “We walked to school together every morning,” Dad told me.&nbsp;</p><p>She worked her way to manager at the cafeteria, retiring in the early 1980s. Over the course of her tenure, her education level sometimes couldn’t keep up with her natural-born smarts, so she’d ask for my aunt’s help on the weekends to work out the financial parts of her menus. She became known for her vegetable soups, yeast rolls, and peanut butter cookies.</p><p>Mom remembers Granny’s frustration as, over time, guidelines and budgets added complicated layers to the work and hampered the scratch cooking she preferred. The government cheese went into big batches of creamy macaroni served alongside crisp, fried fish and scoops of turnip greens. She’d sneak in bacon grease from home to flavor green beans. Sadly, her own savory cornbread eventually gave way to a quicker and sweeter mix at school. My cousin Margaret remembers a student asking her: “Mrs. Culpepper, is this cornbread — or just bad cake?”</p><p>County employees would sometimes join the students for lunch as if she were running a restaurant. “She had a name county-wide for the meals she served,” says Gene Crawford, a columnist for the local newspaper who taught at the school in the 1970s.</p>

  <p>Dad remembers when the lunchroom was just an old clapboard structure with wooden floors. Students who brought their lunch, often because they couldn’t afford the cafeteria meal, sat on benches along the perimeter. Granny tried to be discreet in making sure those kids had plenty. “What have you got to eat today?” Dad remembers her asking, peeking into their bags and sometimes finding nothing but a leftover biscuit. “She would give them anything she could get her hands on,” he says. She left out extra bowls of grits and gravy or commodity foods for students to share. At least once, the principal scolded her for giving away food for free. “Do I make money for this lunchroom?” she asked him. <em>Yes.</em> “Do I lose money for this lunchroom?” <em>No.</em> “Well, don’t you ever get on to me again for giving those kids food,” my mother remembers Granny recounting. “No kid will ever leave this lunchroom hungry.”&nbsp;</p><p>But before we go too far: a warning. If you’re looking for a dreamy, idyllic grandma story where I stand at her elbow and learn recipes, this ain’t it. I somehow don’t have a single recipe from Granny, even if she was the best cook I’ve ever known. But I did learn plenty else from her and felt her love in different ways. I’d sometimes sit with her and her dogs Tico or George while she chewed tobacco and watched Braves games. I remember her feisty attitude, stout build, and strong hands. She would squeeze my upper arms every time I entered her kitchen and compliment me on weight gain (a confusing but comforting message for a teen girl). It took me years to realize how she’d influenced my life as a food writer.&nbsp;</p><p>In reflecting on her now, I wanted to check in with modern-day heroes of the school lunch line. Even as it feels like our social safety nets are crumbling, I see in these workers a sharp stewardship of resources, a special sort of hospitality, and — despite government red tape and political divides — a deep commitment to community care.</p>

  <p><strong>Stephanie Dillard at Enterprise City Schools in South Alabama likes to sit down for lunch with the kids and hear their thoughts on the food.</strong> She’s a longtime board member and newly elected president of the School Nutrition Association, a nonprofit organization of more than 50,000 lunch ladies (and fellas) and others interested in school nutrition. But day to day, you’ll find Dillard filling in for kitchen staff, crunching budget numbers, and working to get fresh, locally grown foods onto kids’ plates. Last year that meant satsumas from a neighboring county to serve with roasted chicken and broccoli. It meant local strawberries and even a special shrimp bowl with the region’s beloved Conecuh sausage.&nbsp;</p><p>“The greatest joy is just knowing that we are feeding children healthy meals. So many families rely on us daily,” Dillard says. “I just want to continue to see that all children have equal access to the meals.”&nbsp;</p><p>But Dillard is clear about the challenges. “Number one, we need more funding, so we can increase scratch cooking and more farm-to-school programs,” she says. “With the MAHA movement, they’re pushing, obviously, more scratch cooking, and that’s great and grand. I have no problem with less processed foods in schools, but we need the funding to be able to support it.”&nbsp;</p><p>To be sure, the stew of school food has long been mixed with politics and money. The National School Lunch Act, which passed in 1946, four years before my grandmother started cafeteria work, had its roots in an ecosystem of competing interests, says Marcus Weaver-Hightower, author of <em>Unpacking School Lunch: Understanding the Hidden Politics of School Food</em>. Over the years, politicians have argued over funding cuts, regulations, and what makes food healthy — along with who gets to set the menu.</p><p>Of late, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. seems to champion some of the healthier standards that conservatives once criticized, and partly rolled back, when the same ideas were espoused by then-First Lady Michelle Obama’s Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act campaign. (The opening lines of a 2014 Heritage Foundation article: “Michelle Obama thinks she knows what your children should eat.”)&nbsp;</p><p>Kennedy has advocated for healthier school food even as the Trump administration has cut millions in funding that would help make that possible, including eliminating the Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program and Patrick Leahy Farm to School Grants.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Samantha Goyret and Caroline Ideus, co-directors of the Northwest Tennessee Local Food Network, had a statewide farm-to-school plan ready to implement — at least until the funding was cut.&nbsp;</p><p>Goyret and Ideus, who produce a guide to local farmers and producers and manage a West Tennessee farmers market, began serving as vital liaisons between farmers and school nutrition directors several years ago. They knew both groups were overworked, with little time to make connections. Goyret and Ideus also helped arrange transportation and delivery. Local farmers earned market values for their products while schools amped up nutrition in ways that appealed to kids. “It’s like, <em>OK, we’re finally finding solutions to these problems</em>,” Goyret says. “Then the government’s like, <em>No, we’re not going to fund you anymore. So, good luck. Just try to figure it out on your own</em>.”&nbsp;</p><p>Lisa Seiber-Garland, school nutrition director for the Trenton Special School District in Trenton, Tennessee, says students loved items like local butter lettuce and purple hull peas obtained through a federal grant. She learned that at least one student convinced her mother to visit a nearby farm for the tender leaves she had tasted atop her school burger. “It was so cool,” Seiber-Garland says. “Grants like that provide access for kids to have things they wouldn’t normally have. With that grant, we were also able to provide fresh ground beef. … We’re still doing it, but not to the extent with the grant. It was such a blessing I didn’t want to stop. I told my farmers I will do what I can to still buy. One had planted his strawberries and his watermelons and everything to meet what we needed in the school for that year. And then we lost the grant.”&nbsp;</p><p>Goyret confirms that, indeed, seeds had been planted, orders had been placed. “With every administration, there’s always changes,” she says. “But what’s different about this administration is that they are taking away already allocated funds — funds allocated by the Congress. That should be 100 percent illegal.”&nbsp;</p><p>But, per usual, school nutrition directors are making do.</p>

  <p>Dillard says the federal funding cuts will hurt local farmers in Alabama, but her state offers rebates when she serves Alabama-grown foods. “They direct us and help me find the farmers that have the ability to grow enough for our district,” she says. “So I’m very lucky in that aspect. As soon as we find something new or new farmers willing to grow for us, we jump on that.”&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, in Tennessee, Seiber-Garland works through a different grant specifically for elementary students to provide snacks of fresh fruit and vegetables paired with nutritional education. “The kids are the joy for sure. Watching them and their excitement when there’s something they really like,” she says, of offering students new tastes as well as standbys like peaches, grapes, berries, pepper strips, and carrots. A student’s mother came up to her at the cafeteria and said, “You’re the reason my daughter likes raspberries.”&nbsp;</p><p>In 2022, California became the first of a half dozen or so states to offer free school meals to all students, regardless of family income. Dillard supports free meals for all students with an emphatic, “Yes, yes, yes!” Food should not be based on income, she says: “It should be part of the school day. Your transportation is of no charge to students. School books are no charge to students. School lunch should be of no charge to students. … It’s just the right thing to do.”&nbsp;</p><p>Still, most schools must provide a mix of fee-based and subsidized free and reduced-price meals. Some communities with high percentages of families on SNAP and enrolled in Medicaid automatically qualify for the USDA’s Community Eligibility Provision, which authorizes free meals for all students in the district. But, as the “Big Beautiful Bill” slashes both SNAP and Medicaid, it will surely reverberate through school lunchrooms too. “It’s going to be a huge burden for a lot of families,” says Weaver-Hightower. “The number of problems I think [free lunches] would solve is a really long list. There’s paperwork, of course. And there’s the shame and stigma that some kids feel. Why would we do that to little 5-year-olds?”</p>

He left his prestigious role in 2015 to create Brigaid, a company now working with 40 school districts in eight states along with other institutions such as senior centers and prisons.&nbsp;</p><p>His team has adopted the pragmatic approach long espoused by the professionals in those settings. “We don’t say, <em>This is the food you should serve</em>, or, <em>You shouldn’t serve this food</em>,” he explains. “It is their program and it is their community. Who are we to come from the outside to tell them otherwise? So we come in and ask, <em>What are you trying to achieve with your program?</em>”</p><p>Giusti loves the puzzle — the dynamics and balance of nutrition and taste preference. “I was talking with a food service director, and she uses the statistic that roughly 70 percent of the calories students eat in her district come from the food in the schools. So you have a real responsibility to make sure that food is nutritious. But at the same point you also need to make sure kids want to eat it. … Kids need to eat. Period.”</p><p>Giusti stresses that policies need to be backed up with resources. “It’s amazing to talk about removing processed foods, cooking more from scratch. I have a business based off of that,” he says. “It’s also really hard to do. If we’re going to say to School District XYZ, <em>You can’t use these things anymore</em>, then I hope we’re also going to give them money to buy more equipment and train their staff.”</p><p>Furthermore, edicts need to take into account the people who have to implement them, Giusti stresses. “Folks who work in the kitchens get caught in the mix,” he says. “You can feel it on them. They’re just waiting for the next initiative. They’ve maybe been working in these schools for 20, 30 years, and they’ve seen so many initiatives come and go, come and go. They’ve seen people come and go. Superintendents come and go. But they’re still there. Doing this work every day.”</p>

  <p><strong>Similar to my grandmother, Hope North in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, started work at the cafeteria when her son entered school.</strong> She’s been in food service ever since, about 27 years. Long enough to see her grandson attend Murfreesboro City Schools, too.</p><p>On a recent summer day, she climbed onto a brightly painted old school bus with the words CHOW BUS across its front. Inside, the seats had been reconfigured into booths with tables. About 50 meals sat in cooler bags: penne pasta with tomato-meat sauce, a side of carrots, fruit cups, and milk. The bus was headed for Chariot Pointe Apartments, the first stop of about five that day.</p><p>“We meet people where they are,” says Tori Carr, a school employee who was driving a van that followed the bus, which had been converted into a sort of free book store. Its shelves also carry cleaning supplies, pantry items, and simple toys like glow sticks and coloring pages.</p><p>North’s cousin Keith Sneed drives the Chow Bus as well as regular bus routes during the school year. The two make a good team — tough and tender. They run their route every day in the summer heat, bus windows down. North keeps tabs on her people at each stop. She knows their stories and worries. And if they don’t show up for a few days, she’ll be on the case.</p><p>They’d hardly parked at their first location, when a young man in a yellow T-shirt approached the bus. Sneed poked his head out the window. “Man, go get a book!” he said. “You ain’t read a book all summer.” The boy couldn’t help but oblige. Book in hand, he got a fist bump from Sneed as he climbed up the steps for a meal.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s not just about the food,” Sneed explained later. “All they want is for you to listen to them.” But, of course, food is important, too. Not all schools can serve summer meals, which leaves many students at risk. And while this school used to have three Chow buses, funded by a USDA grant, they’re now down to one. “If we lose this bus,” Sneed says, “people will be hungry.”</p>

  <p><strong>Today, my grandmother’s town of Blue Ridge is surrounded by million-dollar vacation homes, its downtown sidewalks lined with art galleries and outfitters selling $6,000 bamboo fly rods.</strong> The economic disparity between visitors and full-time residents is vast. Fannin County schools qualify for the Community Eligibility Provision, which allows free meals for all — at least for now.&nbsp;</p><p>Martha Williams, who works as director of nutrition and wellness in Fannin County School District, grew up here and originally returned to teach math. But a cafeteria lunch lady inspired Williams to work in school nutrition when she pulled the teacher aside and pointed out a student who seemed disheveled and kept wearing the same clothes. Williams recognized the insights that can be gleaned from the serving line and how the work goes beyond keeping kids fed to providing stability, routine, and community care.&nbsp;</p><p>Williams points to another inspiration, GiGi Thomas, 63, who has worked in school food service for more than two decades. These days one of her duties is serving cookies, kept in an ancient warmer that “probably came over on the Mayflower,” Thomas says with a laugh. She hands students freshly baked cookies on napkins. “I see these kids every day,” she says. Some of them like chocolate chip cookies, others prefer sugar cookies. “It tickles them to death that I kind of remember what they get.”&nbsp;</p><p>In 2023, her cookies were featured in the high school seniors’ graduation video. “If you don’t have the cookies, those kids are devastated,” Thomas says. “That’s all you wanna do is take care of the kids.”&nbsp;</p><p>Over in West Tennessee, Seiber-Garland says she sometimes feels like she has 1,400 kids of her own. If no one shows up for a student on grandparents’ day, she fills in. And she loves running into students outside school, where they’re excited to say, “There’s my lunch lady!” Alumni sometimes share photos of their kids. “They’re so special. Every one of them.”&nbsp;</p><p>Over her 22 years in the business, Seiber-Garland has served her mother’s recipe for poppyseed chicken as well as old favorites like chicken tetrazzini and spaghetti. “I’ve always said, <em>I want this to be their cafe</em>. I can’t control what goes on at night. But for two-thirds or three-fourths of the day, I can. And I want them to be fed and happy, well, and blessed. They bless me.”&nbsp;</p><p>She tells of a student who kept trying to save her meal to carry home, because she didn’t have anything to eat there. Seiber-Garland and her staff found a way to provide her with a second meal for the evening. “I also had a parent come tell me to not let her child eat. And I’m like, <em>No ma’am. If she asks to eat in my line, I’m gonna feed her.</em>” &nbsp;</p><p>Seiber-Garland says there are people who donate every year to help pay off lunch balances that have remained unpaid. Recently, she created a “share table” on a red cart with a donated Yeti cooler that helps teach kids about reducing food waste. It’s where students can leave unopened milks or whole food that they don’t want for their classmates to enjoy. She’s also been known to cover lunches out of her own pocket, and her staff has taken up collections, too. “They’re gonna be fed,” she says. “We’ll find a way.”&nbsp;</p><p>I hear in those words the resourcefulness and care of my own grandmother and a guiding phrase she taught my father in standing up for what you believe. &nbsp;</p><p>As Granny would say, “You take your part.”&nbsp; ◊</p>

Available in public beta, this feature ensures API responses always match your specified JSON schemas or tool definitions.</p><p>With structured outputs, developers can eliminate schema-related parsing errors and failed tool calls by ensuring that Claude's responses conform to a defined schema—whether you're extracting data from images, orchestrating agents, or integrating with external APIs.</p><h3>Building reliable applications</h3><p>For developers building applications and agents in production, a single error in data formatting can cause cascading failures. Structured outputs solves this by guaranteeing your response matches the exact structure you define, without any impact to model performance. This makes Claude dependable for applications and agents where accuracy is critical, including:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Data extraction </strong>when downstream systems rely on error-free, consistent formats.</li><li><strong>Multi-agent architectures </strong>where consistent communication between agents is critical for a performant, stable experience.</li><li><strong>Complex search tools </strong>where multiple search fields must be filled in accurately and conform to specific patterns.</li></ul><p>Structured outputs can be used two ways: with JSON or tools. When used with JSON, you provide your schema definition in the API request. For tools, you define your tool specifications, and Claude's output conforms to those tool definitions automatically.</p><p>The end result is a reliable output, reduced retries, and a simplified codebase that no longer needs failover logic or complex error handling.</p><h3>Customer Spotlight: OpenRouter</h3><p>OpenRouter provides 4M+ developers access to all major AI models through a single, unified interface.</p><p>"Structured outputs have become a really valuable part of the agentic AI stack. Agents constantly ingest and produce structured data, so Anthropic’s structured outputs close a real gap for developers. Agent workflows run reliably, every time, and teams can focus on their customers rather than debugging tool calls,” said Chris Clark, COO, OpenRouter.</p><h3>Getting started</h3><p>Structured outputs is now available in public beta for Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.1 on the Claude Developer Platform, with support for Haiku 4.5 coming soon.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Much of the developer world is familiar with the AWS outage in <code>us-east-1</code> that occurred on October 20th <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/101925/">due to a race condition bug</a> inside a DNS management service. The backlog of events we needed to process from that outage on the 20th stretched our system to the limits, and so we decided to increase our headroom for event handling throughput. When we attempted that infrastructure upgrade on October 23rd, we ran into yet another race condition bug in Aurora RDS. This is the story of how we figured out it was an AWS bug (later confirmed by AWS) and what we learned.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The Hightouch Events product enables organizations to gather and centralize user behavioral data such as page views, clicks, and purchases. Customers can setup syncs to load events into a cloud data warehouse for analytics or stream them directly to marketing, operational, and analytics tools to support real-time personalization use cases.</p>
<p>Here is the portion of Hightouch’s architecture dedicated to our events system:</p>

<p>Hightouch events system architecture</p>
<p>Our system scales on three levers: Kubernetes clusters that contain event collectors and batch workers, Kafka for event processing, and Postgres as our virtual queue metadata store.</p>
<p>When our pagers went off during the AWS outage on the 20th, we observed:</p>
<ul role="list"><li>Services were unable to connect to Kafka brokers managed by AWS MSK.</li><li>Services struggled to autoscale because we couldn’t provision new EC2 nodes.</li><li>Customer functions for realtime data transformation were unavailable due to AWS STS errors, which caused our retry queues to balloon in size.</li></ul>
<p>Kafka’s durability meant that no events were dropped once they were accepted by the collectors, but there was a massive backlog to process. Syncs with consistently high traffic or with enrichments that needed to call slower 3rd party services took longer to catch up and were testing the limits of our (small) Postgres instance’s ability to act as a queue for the batch metadata.</p>
<p>As an aside, at Hightouch, we <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazingcto.com/postgres-for-everything/">start with Postgres where we can</a>. Postgres queues serve our non-events architecture well at ~1M syncs/day and for events scaled to 500K events per second at ~1s end-to-end latency on a small Aurora instance.</p>
<p>After observing the events on the 20th, We wanted to upsize the DB to give us more headroom. Given that <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html">Aurora</a> supports <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL.Managing.html#:~:text=As%20an%20alternative,Amazon%20Aurora%20PostgreSQL">fast failovers</a> for scaling up instances, we decided to proceed with an upgrade on Oct 23rd without a scheduled maintenance window.</p>
<h3 id="aws-aurora-rds">AWS Aurora RDS</h3>
<p>The central datastore for real-time streaming and warehouse delivery of customer events uses <strong>Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL</strong>.</p>
<p>Aurora's architecture differs from traditional PostgreSQL in a crucial way: it separates compute from storage. An Aurora cluster consists of:</p>
<ul role="list"><li><strong>One primary writer instance</strong> that handles all write operations</li><li><strong>Multiple read replica instances</strong> that handle read-only queries</li><li><strong>A shared storage layer</strong> that all instances access, automatically replicated across multiple availability zones</li></ul>
<p>This architecture enables fast failovers and efficient read scaling, but as we'd discover, it also introduces unique failure modes.</p>
<p>A <strong>failover</strong> is the process of promoting a read replica to become the new primary writer - typically done automatically when the primary fails, or manually triggered for maintenance operations like ours. When you trigger a failover in the AWS console:</p>

<p>How Hightouch Events uses Aurora</p>
<h2 id="the-plan">The Plan</h2>
<p>This was our upgrade plan:</p>
<ol role="list"><li>Add another read replica (instance #3) to maintain read capacity during the upgrade.</li><li>Upgrade the existing reader (instance #2) to the target size and give it the highest failover priority.</li><li>Trigger a failover to promote instance #2 as the new writer (expected downtime less than 15s, handled gracefully by our backend).</li><li>Upgrade the old writer (instance #1) to match the size and make it a reader.</li><li>Remove the temporary extra reader (instance #3).</li></ol>
<p>The AWS docs supported this approach and we had already tested the process successfully in a staging environment while performing a load test, so we were confident in the correctness of the procedure.</p>
<h2 id="the-upgrade-attempt">The Upgrade Attempt</h2>
<p>At 16:39 EDT on October 23, 2025, we triggered the failover to the newly-upgraded instance #2. The AWS Console showed the typical progression: parameter adjustments, instance restarts, the usual status updates.</p>
<p>Then the page refreshed. Instance #1 - the original writer was still the primary. The failover had <strong>reversed itself</strong>.</p>
<p>According to AWS everything was healthy. The cluster appeared healthy across the board. But our backend services couldn't execute write queries. Restarting the services cleared the errors and restored normal operation, but the upgrade had failed.</p>
<p>We tried again at 16:43. Same result: brief promotion followed by immediate reversal.</p>
<p><strong>Two failed failovers in five minutes</strong>. Nothing else had changed - no code updates, no unusual queries, no traffic spikes. We had successfully tested this exact procedure in a staging environment under load earlier in the day. We checked our process to see if we had made any mistakes. We searched online to see if anyone else had encountered this issue but found nothing. Nothing obvious could explain why Aurora was refusing to complete the failover in this cluster. We were perplexed.</p>
<h2 id="the-investigation">The Investigation</h2>
<p>We first checked database metrics for anything unusual. There was a spike in connection count, network traffic, and commit throughput to the read replica (instance #2) during the failover.</p>
<p>The higher commit throughput could have been due to replication or the execution of write queries. The other two metrics simply indicated a higher query volume.</p>
<p>We checked the read query traffic from the app (graph below), and found that there was no change during this period. This told us the extra traffic to instance #2 came from our backend services which are supposed to connect to the writer instance.</p>

<ol role="list"><li>The pods did not get the signal that the writer had changed - i.e. the cluster did not terminate the connection.</li><li>The cluster endpoint incorrectly pointed to a reader instance.</li><li>The pod was connected to the writer, but the write operation was rejected at runtime.</li></ol>
<p>We did not find any evidence supporting or disproving #1 in the application logs. We had a strong suspicion it was either #2 or #3. We downloaded the database logs to take a closer look and found something interesting. In both the promoted reader and the original writer, we found the same sequence of logs:</p>
<pre><code><span>2025</span><span>-10</span><span>-23</span> <span>20</span>:<span>38</span>:<span>58</span> UTC::@:[<span>569</span>]:LOG:  starting PostgreSQL...
...
...
...
LOG:  database <span>system</span> <span>is</span> ready <span>to</span> accept connections
LOG:  server process (PID <span>799</span>) was terminated <span>by</span> signal <span>9</span>: Killed
DETAIL:  Failed process was <span>running</span>: <span>&lt;</span>write query <span>from</span> backend application<span>&gt;</span>
LOG:  terminating <span>any</span> other active server processes
FATAL:  Can<span>'t handle storage runtime process crash
LOG:  database system is shut down
</span></code></pre>
<p>This led us to a hypothesis:</p>
<p>During the failover window, Aurora briefly allowed both instances to process writes. The distributed storage layer rejected the concurrent write operations, causing both instances to crash.</p>
<p>We expect Aurora’s failover orchestration to do something like this:</p>
<ol role="list"><li>Stop accepting new writes. Clients can expect connection errors until the failover completes.</li><li>Finish processing in-flight write requests.</li><li>Demote the writer and simultaneously promote the reader.</li><li>Accept new write requests on the new writer.</li></ol>
<p><strong>There was clearly a race condition between steps 3 &amp; 4.</strong></p>
<h2 id="testing-the-hypothesis">Testing the Hypothesis</h2>
<p>To validate the theory, we performed a controlled failover attempt. This time:</p>
<ol role="list"><li>We scaled down all services that write to the database</li><li>We triggered the failover again</li><li>We monitored for storage runtime crashes</li></ol>
<p>By eliminating <strong>concurrent writes</strong>, the failover completed successfully. This strongly reinforced the race-condition hypothesis.</p>
<h2 id="aws-confirms-the-root-cause">AWS Confirms the Root Cause</h2>
<p>We escalated the findings and log patterns to AWS. After an internal review, AWS confirmed that:</p>
<p>The root cause was due to an internal signaling issue in the demotion process of the old writer, resulting in the writer being unchanged after the failover.</p>
<p><strong>They also confirmed that there was nothing unique about our configuration or usage that would trigger the bug</strong>. The conditions that caused it were not under our control.</p>
<p>AWS has indicated a fix is on their roadmap, but as of now, the recommended mitigation aligns with our solution: use Aurora’s Failover feature on an as-needed basis and ensure that no writes are executed against the DB during the failover.</p>
<h2 id="final-state">Final State</h2>
<p>With the race condition understood and mitigated, we:</p>
<ul role="list"><li>Successfully upsized the cluster in <code>us-east-1</code></li><li>Updated our internal playbooks to <strong>pause writers before an intentional failover</strong></li><li>Added monitoring to detect any unexpected writer role advertisement flips</li></ul>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>The following principles were reinforced during this experience:</p>
<ol role="list"><li>Prepare for the worst in any migration - you could end up in your desired end state, beginning state, or an in-between state - even for services you trust. Ensuring you’re ready to redirect traffic and handle brief outages in dependencies will minimize downtime.</li><li>The importance of good observability cannot be emphasized enough. The “brief writer advertisement” was only detectable because we were monitoring queries to each instance in Datadog and had access to database logs in RDS.</li><li>For large scale distributed systems, isolating the impact any single component can have on the system can help both uptime and maintenance. It helps a lot if the design allows for such events without completely shutting down the system.</li><li>Test setups are not always representative of production environments. Even though we practiced the upgrade process during a load test in a staging region, we could not reproduce the exact conditions that caused the race condition in Aurora. AWS confirmed that there was nothing specific about our traffic pattern that would trigger it.</li></ol>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="4189490c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
					<p>A major political confrontation over online privacy is approaching as European governments prepare to decide on “<a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/eu-chat-control-2-0-experts-warn-against-encryption-surveillance-law">Chat Control 2.0,</a>” the European Commission’s revised proposal for monitoring private digital communications.</p>
<p>The plan, which could be endorsed behind closed doors, has drawn urgent warnings from Dr. Patrick Breyer, a jurist and former Member of the European Parliament, who says the draft conceals sweeping new surveillance powers beneath misleading language about “risk mitigation” and “child protection.”</p>
<p>In a release sent to Reclaim The Net, Breyer, long a defender of digital freedom, argues that the Commission has quietly reintroduced compulsory scanning of private messages after it was previously rejected.</p>
<p>He describes the move as a “deceptive sleight of hand,” insisting that it transforms a supposedly voluntary framework into a system that could compel all chat, email, and messaging providers to monitor users.</p>
<p>“This is a political deception of the highest order,” Breyer said.</p>
<p>“Following loud public protests, several member states, including <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/germany-rejects-eu-chat-control-law">Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Austria, said ‘No’</a> to indiscriminate Chat Control. Now it’s coming back through the back door disguised, more dangerous, and more comprehensive than ever. The public is being played for fools.”</p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://docs.reclaimthenet.org/council-presidency-lewp-csa-r-presidency-compromise-texts-14092.pdf">new text</a>, providers would be obliged to take “all appropriate risk mitigation measures” to prevent abuse on their platforms. While the Commission presents this as a flexible safety requirement, Breyer insists it is a loophole that could justify forcing companies to scan every private message, including those protected by end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p>“The loophole renders the much-praised removal of detection orders worthless and negates their supposed voluntary nature,” he said.</p>
<p>He warns that it could even lead to the introduction of “client-side scanning,” where users’ devices themselves perform surveillance before messages are sent.</p>
<p>Unlike the current temporary exemption known as “Chat Control 1.0,” which allows voluntary scanning of photos and videos, the new draft would open the door to text and metadata analysis. Algorithms and artificial intelligence could be deployed to monitor conversations and flag “suspicious” content.</p>
<p>Breyer notes that such automated scrutiny cannot interpret context and risks sweeping up ordinary exchanges. “No AI can reliably distinguish between a flirt, sarcasm, and criminal ‘grooming’,” he said. “Imagine your phone scanning every conversation with your partner, your daughter, your therapist, and leaking it just because the word ‘love’ or ‘meet’ appears somewhere. This is not child protection, this is a digital witch hunt.”</p>
<p>According to Breyer, the existing voluntary system has already proven flawed, with German police reporting that roughly half of all flagged cases turn out to be irrelevant.</p>
<p>The proposal also carries major implications for identity and anonymity online. A new requirement would force users to verify their age before creating accounts on messaging or email platforms, an obligation that would likely require official ID or biometric checks.</p>
<p>Breyer argues that such measures effectively abolish anonymous communication. “This is the de facto end of anonymous communication online, a disaster for whistleblowers, journalists, political activists, and people seeking help who rely on the protection of anonymity,” he said.</p>
<p>He also condemned the provision restricting minors under 16 from using messaging and social media platforms with chat functions. “Digital isolation instead of education, protection by exclusion instead of empowerment, this is paternalistic, out of touch with reality, and pedagogical nonsense,” he warned, saying the measure risks cutting young people off from key channels of social and educational interaction.</p>
<p>Breyer is calling on EU governments that previously resisted mass surveillance, among them Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Czechia, Luxembourg, Finland, Austria, and Estonia, to block the regulation in its current form.</p>
<p>“Now, these governments must show some backbone!” he urged. “Block this sham compromise in the Council and demand immediate corrections to save the fundamental rights of all citizens.”</p>
<p>He proposes a series of specific changes before any agreement should move forward: a guarantee that “risk mitigation” cannot be used to mandate scanning, a prohibition on AI-driven monitoring of text conversations, strict judicial oversight for targeted investigations, and the preservation of anonymous access to communication tools.</p>
<p>“They are selling us security but delivering a total surveillance machine,” Breyer concluded.</p>
<p>“They promise child protection but punish our children and criminalize privacy. This is not a compromise; this is a fraud against the citizen. And no democratic government should make itself an accomplice.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>Bitchat is a new messaging app that allows users to chat securely with or without internet access. Download it today via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bitchat-mesh/id6748219622?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>App Store</u></a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitchat.droid&amp;ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>Google Play store</u></a> to begin communicating safely, even when connectivity disappears.</p><p><strong><u>Why Bitchat is needed</u></strong></p><p>Palestinians are dependent on Israel for their access to electricity, telecoms, and internet routing. Israel has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/world/middleeast/gaza-electricity.html?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>weaponized</u></a> this dependence in Gaza by deliberately causing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-says-full-internet-blackout-gaza-paralyzing-aid-operations-2025-06-12/?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>blackouts</u></a> that have left Palestinians cut off from communicating with each other or with the outside world. The relentless bombing campaign has also destroyed or severely crippled any remaining communication infrastructure.</p><p>Even when Palestinians use regular communication methods, their conversations and messages can be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>monitored and recorded</u></a>, leaving them exposed to surveillance and potential targeting.</p><p>The basic human right to communicate freely, and without interruption, has been denied to the Palestinian people.</p><p><strong><u>The solution</u></strong></p><p>Bitchat lets you keep messaging even when the internet or power is down. It connects phones directly through Bluetooth, and each phone helps pass messages along, allowing communication to stretch much farther than just your immediate area. Everything is fully encrypted so your conversations stay private.</p><p>When you do have internet or cell service, Bitchat can send your messages anywhere in the world using a network of relays. There is no central server that stores any of your data. You don’t need to create an account, share your phone number or email, or even have a SIM card to use it.</p><p><strong><u>Staying connected when all else fails</u></strong></p><p>Bitchat is an Israel-proof messaging alternative that continues to work even when traditional networks are shut down. The app also has “Geohash” channels that allows users to join location-based chats, so Palestinians can stay connected to their neighbors down the street or to the larger community in cities across the region.&nbsp;</p><p>This lets Palestinians check on the safety of loved ones, organize and coordinate within their communities, and share critical news and updates.</p><p><strong><u>Validated by T4P</u></strong></p><p>T4P has evaluated the app, testing it in various conditions, and looked at the technology and governance of the application. After this evaluation, T4P recognizes it as a secure and resilient communication tool for Palestinian communities when faced with internet disruptions or outages. In addition, Tech for Palestine community members are among BitChat’s top code contributors.</p><p>Bitchat has seen a surge in downloads in countries facing civil unrest like Nepal, Indonesia, Côte d'Ivoire, and most recently Madagascar. The Nepali government <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/09/11/jack-dorseys-bitchat-gains-traction-during-nepals-unrest/?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>blocked access</u></a> to all major social media platforms, forcing civilians to search for alternative methods of communication.</p><p>WhatsApp is known to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/05/22/whatsapp-security-vulnerability-meta-israel-palestine/?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>expose</u></a> <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2025/09/09/whatsapp-and-meta-accused-of-serious-security-breaches-by-former-executive_6745186_13.html?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>private</u></a> data, potentially to Israel – and these breaches have been used to <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240418-israel-using-metas-whatsapp-to-kill-palestinians-in-gaza-through-ai-system/?ref=updates.techforpalestine.org"><u>target Palestinians</u></a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p>The more I speak about being poor, the more I realize how fundamentally other folks misunderstand what it means to be poor versus being broke. The advice folks will give comes from a good place. However, I would like to give some examples to help everyone understand most advice from non-poor folks isn’t helpful.</p>
<p>Everyone has experienced being broke. Being broke sucks. You are watching every dollar spent, finding wayys to trim or make things stretch until the next payday. The difference is when you are broke you have <em>some money</em>. You can afford to put gas in your car, but not enough to do that repair. Money is tight, but you can get the basics at the grocery store. You can’t afford to go to the movies, but will stay home and watch what’s new on Netflix. Being broke sucks. You are watching every dollar spent, finding ways to trim or make things stretch until the next payday.</p>
<p>When you are poor that next payday brings no relief. It is like an endless runner game. No matter how fast you run or how high you jump you can never see the finish line. No matter how tired you are the ground keeps moving. There is no room for errors as the punishment for mistakes is astronomical. When you hit an obstacle you don’t restart from the last checkpoint, you go back to the beginning.</p>
<p>There is this mindset from folks that poor people must not be smart. I mean, you’re smart and you’re not poor! The problem must be a skill issue! Learn the skills to do it yourself and you’ll be able to pull yourself up.</p>
<p>The other mindset is poor people are lazy. Quit complaining and do it yourself!  Just get a better job! Get a second job! There’s money out there, you just have to go get it.</p>
<p>The last is these folks think they understand what it is like to be poor. Hey, I was a broke college student and I get being poor! I had a rough patch, it will pass.</p>
<p>Let’s start at the top.</p>
<p>I have a van that is falling apart. It needs a lot of work that we cannot afford to do. In the mindset that poor people are unskilled, it appears that I should watch some YouTube videos, get the parts, and do it myself. The misunderstanding is that being poor means you have tons and tons of skills. You have to fix everything yourself. There is never, I mean never, a time you can pay someone to fix it for you.</p>
<p>In this example folks think, “If the repair at the shop costs $1,000, but the parts cost $300, you can save a lot of money doing it yourself.” You are absolutely correct. Yet, I still need to be able to afford the $300 in parts.</p>
<p>Do you see the misunderstanding? I can’t make $300 appear out of thin air. I have the skills, I’ve had to fix all my cars myself. I’ve done complete engine rebuilds, I’ve replaced transmissions, I do all my own regular maintenance. The problem isn’t skills, its <em>money</em>. When you are broke, spending $300 instead of $1,000 sounds like a win because you can’t afford the $1,000. When you’re poor $300 might as well be $1,000 or $10,000, you will never afford it.</p>
<p>This is not a matter of time, either. I can’t put aside money each month and then get it. There is never money to put aside. I can’t put it on the credit card as I know I will never be able to pay it. I’ll just have this $300 debt looming over me, increasing with interest every month, mocking how much of a loser I am.</p>
<p>The second mindset: Being lazy.</p>
<p>How do I have the time to work multiple jobs when I’m doing all this extra work? How do I have the time when in my extra time I’m fixing cars, appliances, the roof, and cooking every meal from scratch?</p>
<p>Should I work a second job and never see my wife? My kids? Should I never have any personal time? Should my entire life revolve around money? Should I kill myself for capitalism?</p>
<p>Folks who say things like this have only ever experienced being broke. It is a temporary situation and a few months of extra income will solve the problem. Being poor is not missing $1,000 or $10,000 in the short term. It’s missing $40,000 a year, every year, forever. There is no short term relief. This isn’t a rough patch. It is The Pit in The Dark Knight Rises.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There’s a reason why this prison is the worst hell on earth… Hope. Every man who has rotted here over the centuries has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy… So simple… And like shipwrecked men turning to sea water from uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. I learned here that there can be no true despair without hope.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, it is possible to escape. Hell, two people have done it! Why can’t you do it! But you are completely ignoring how many people have fallen to their death trying.</p>
<p>All of the general guidance to escape being poor is actually advice for getting through being broke.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cancel Netflix</li>
<li>Make food at home</li>
<li>Stop going to Starbucks</li>
<li>Fix it yourself</li>
<li>Don’t upgrade your phone</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all things that will help you <em>temporarily</em>. It will help you get through a short period of being broke. Or it will help you get your spending under control. You have enough money, you just don’t spend it wisely.</p>
<p>Being poor is you already did all those things. You cancelled all your streaming services years ago. You make all your food from scratch all the time. You never go to fucking Starbucks. You fix everything yourself. You already stretch everything to the limit. That is how you have to live every day of your life, for eternity, with no relief in sight.</p>
<p>Last example and is pertinent to our times in the US. A lot of poor folks are having to stand in line for hours and hours to get food at a food bank due to goverment ineptitude. The advice to simply cook at home doesn’t fix that there isn’t any food at home.</p>
<p>Do you honestly think people standing in line at a food bank could fix their situation if they stopped getting DoorDash? Going to Starbucks? Fuck off. They weren’t doing that already.</p>
<p>How are they to get another job or put in extra hours if they have to stand in line for 3 hours to get food? Should they go without food until they get that job and the paycheck?</p>
<p>You need to step aside and think about the differences between being broke and being poor.</p>

         A new study finds that the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease, can be weakened by disrupting its balance of manganese.

        </div>

        
            <div id="news-story">
                        <p>For decades, Lyme disease has frustrated both physicians and patients alike. Caused by the corkscrew-shaped bacterium <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>, the infection, if left untreated, can linger for months, leading to fever, fatigue and painful inflammation.</p>

<p>In a new study, Northwestern University and Uniformed Services University (USU) scientists have uncovered a surprising — and ironic — vulnerability in the hardy bacterium. By exploiting this vulnerability, researchers could help disarm&nbsp;<em>B. burgdorferi</em>, potentially leading to new therapeutic strategies for Lyme disease.</p>

<p>The Northwestern and USU team discovered that manganese, which helps shield <em>B. burgdorferi</em> against its host’s immune system, is simultaneously also a crack in its armor. If <em>B. burgdorferi</em> is either starved of or overloaded with manganese, the bacteria become highly vulnerable to the host’s immune system or treatments they would otherwise resist.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.02824-25">study was published</a> today (Nov. 13) in the journal mBio.</p>

<p>“Our work shows that manganese is a double-edged sword in Lyme disease,” said Northwestern’s <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/hoffmanchem/">Brian Hoffman</a>, who co-led the study with USU’s <a href="https://www.usuhs.edu/profile/michael-daly-phd">Michael Daly</a>. “It’s both Borrelia’s armor and its weakness. If we can target the way it manages manganese, we could open doors for entirely new approaches for treating Lyme disease.”</p>

<p>Hoffman is the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Chemistry and molecular biosciences at Northwestern’s <a href="https://weinberg.northwestern.edu/">Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences</a>. He also is a member of the <a href="https://clp.northwestern.edu/">Chemistry of Life Processes Institute</a> and the <a href="https://www.cancer.northwestern.edu/">Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University</a>. Daly is an emeritus professor of pathology at USU.</p>

<p>Since the 1980s, the occurrence of Lyme disease has increased dramatically across North America and around the globe. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/data-research/facts-stats/index.html">roughly 476,000 people</a> in the United States are diagnosed annually. Currently, there are no approved vaccines against the disease, and long-term use of antibiotics is problematic.</p>

<p>“Although antibiotics harm <em>B. burgdorferi</em>, they also kill beneficial gut bacteria,” Daly said. “Lyme disease is transmitted through tick bites and — if not treated promptly — can cause lingering effects by attacking the patient’s immune, circulatory and central nervous systems.”</p>

<p>In a series of previous studies, Hoffman and Daly collaborated to <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2024/12/how-conan-the-bacterium-withstands-extreme-radiation">understand the role of manganese in Deinococcus radiodurans</a>, a radiation-resistant bacteria known as “Conan the Bacterium” for its extraordinary ability to survive harsh conditions. Now, they wanted to see if manganese played a role in <em>B. burgdorferi’s</em> defenses.</p>

<p>To conduct the study, the team used a new tool called electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging to characterize the atomic composition of manganese inside the living bacteria. To add even finer detail, the team harnessed electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy to examine the atoms surrounding manganese. Together, the technologies created a molecular map, showing which forms of manganese were present, where they were located and how they changed under stress.</p>

<p>The “map” revealed a two-tier, manganese-based defense system comprising an enzyme called MnSOD and a pool of manganese metabolites. To withstand bombardment from the host’s immune system, the bacteria first use MnSOD, which acts like a shield. If any oxygen radicals slip past this shield, they are met with the metabolite pool, which acts like a sponge to soak up and neutralize those toxic molecules.</p>

<p>“Our study demonstrates the power of EPR and ENDOR spectroscopies for uncovering hidden biochemical mechanisms in pathogens,” Hoffman said. “Without these tools, <em>B. burgdorferi</em>’s defense system and weak spots would have remained invisible.”</p>

<p>The scientists found the bacteria constantly juggle where to send the manganese — to the MnSOD enzymes or the metabolite pool. Too little manganese and the bacteria lose their defense mechanisms. But, as the microbes age, their metabolite pools dramatically shrink, leaving them exposed to damage and stress. At this point, too much manganese becomes toxic because the bacteria can no longer store it safely.</p>

<p>This discovery holds potential for new Lyme disease therapies. Future drugs could starve the bacterium of manganese, disrupt its ability to form protective manganese complexes or even push it into toxic overload. Any of these approaches would leave&nbsp;<em>B. burgdorferi</em>&nbsp;wide open to attack by the immune system.</p>

<p>“By disrupting the delicate balance of manganese in&nbsp;<em>B. burgdorferi</em>, it may be possible to weaken the pathogen during infection,” Daly said. “Manganese is an Achilles’ heel of its defenses.”</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>The study was supported by the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs’ Tick-borne Disease Research Program and the National Institutes of Health. Additional funds were from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p>

				<h3>from the <i>abandonware</i> dept</h3>
				


				<p>One of my favorite things in all of professional sports is the unofficial holiday referred to as “<a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45590991/bobby-bonilla-day-2025-new-york-mets-pay-million-every-july-1">Bobby Bonilla Day.</a>” The short version of it is that Bonilla played for the New York Mets decades ago and eventually bought out his contract in 2000 when they decided they were done with him. Rather than pay the $5.9 million buyout of the contract up front, the team instead made the bonkers decision to negotiate a deferred payment schedule for that amount <em>with 8% interest</em> over the course of 25 years. The result is that the Mets will be paying Bonilla $1.2 million per year every July 1st, starting in 2011 and ending in 2035. And if you can’t make sense of the math on that one, it’s because you aren’t aware that the Mets ownership <a href="https://people.com/the-former-mlb-player-making-millions-a-year-because-of-bernie-madoff-11764506">was one of Bernie Madoff’s many victims</a>, which is why they had to defer the payments.</p>
<p>November 10th is <em>not</em> Bobby Bonilla Day. But it should be named “Let Us Play <em>No One Lives Forever</em>, You Assholes Day.” The classic spy-shooter turned 25 on that date and, for the exact <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2020/11/11/happy-20th-birthday-to-no-one-lives-forever-classic-pc-game-that-cant-be-sold-today-thanks-to-ip/">same reasons</a> we’ve detailed for a god damned <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2015/03/25/no-copyright-lives-forever-how-apathy-ip-rights-holders-about-their-copyrights-killed-game-re-release/">decade now</a>, you still can’t buy the game.</p>
<p>Here’s the short of it. Due to a series of mergers, closures, and rights purchases, the IP rights for <em>No One Lives Forever</em> and its sequel have been potentially split into three pieces between Warner Bros., Activision, and 20th Century Fox, like it was some kind of fucking horcrux. I say potentially because nobody really knows who owns what, if anything, when it comes to these games. When one company, Nightdive Studios, attempted to remaster and re-release the game as they’ve done with other titles, along with securing trademark rights to the game which hasn’t been sold in over a decade, all three companies complained that they may have rights to it and may sue over it.</p>
<p>All of those qualifiers are, again, because even these companies themselves don’t know what rights they actually have. And why is that? Well, because the gaming rights deals were inked before digital storage was widely used for this sort of thing and, well, nobody seems to be able to locate the actual paperwork denoting who owns what. Here’s an example of an exchange Nightdive had with Activision.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“So we went back to Activision and, [after] numerous correspondence going back and forth, they replied that they thought they might have some rights, but that any records predated digital storage. So we’re talking about a contract in a box someplace.” Kuperman laughed. “The image I get is the end of Indiana Jones… somewhere in a box, maybe in the bowels of Activision, maybe it was shipped off to Iron Mountain or somewhere. And they confessed, they didn’t have [their] hands on it. And they weren’t sure that they even had any of those rights.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which didn’t keep Activision from warning Nightdive that it <em>might</em> totally sue if it moved forward with remastering the game. The other companies made similar noises.</p>
<p>So what’s a person to do if they want to play this game? You can’t buy it legitimately currently. It’s not even for sale anywhere. And a situation like that, which I’ve stated before, completely breaks the copyright bargain. The only option is, as Kotaku of all places notes, to <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-one-lives-forever-modernized-nolf-abandonware-2000642390">download it for free from somewhere</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Downloading games that are available for sale is piracy. It’s illegal, and it’s not supportive of developers and their art. But when companies have gone out of their way to refuse to take your money for a game for the better part of two decades, it’s a very different situation. Look, I’m not your real mom and dad, and I can’t tell you what to do. But if you&nbsp;were&nbsp;to click on this link&nbsp;(link removed by Techdirt due to us not knowing where it takes you) and download both games (as well as spin-off&nbsp;Contract Jack), you’d end up with modernized versions of these classic games, with mods that allow them to work on Windows 10 and 11, and in widescreen. And what better time to do (or not do) this than on the first game’s 25th anniversary?</em></p>
<p><em>At this point (as indeed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-one-will-sell-no-one-lives-forever-so-lets-download-it">it was over eight years ago, the last time I suggested just downloading it, to no negative response at all</a>) we have to consider&nbsp;No One Lives Forever&nbsp;to be abandonware. No one is willing to take ownership of it, although those that&nbsp;could&nbsp;do so sometimes mindlessly threaten to intervene should anyone else try to rebuild it for sale. Nightdive were scared off a decade ago, and it’s been sitting on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/game/the-operative-no-one-lives-forever">GOG’s Dreamlist since that launched earlier this year</a>&nbsp;(with 87,171 people saying they’d pay for it if they could). It’s far too small of a concern for any of the megacorps who&nbsp;might&nbsp;own it to spend the time and money to work out if they do, but it’s far too big of a concern within gaming history to be allowed to just disappear. Thank goodness for the anonymous heroes running NOLF Revival. I thank them for their service.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s the only option the public has to play this game and enjoy this small piece of our collective culture. The real answer here is some sort of copyright reform that makes this situation not a thing. If a company, or group of companies, won’t offer a piece of work for sale, can’t be bothered to understand what they own of it, if anything, and have no plans to figure any of that out… then how can this be copyright infringement?</p>
<p>So happy “Let Us Play <em>No One Lives Forever</em>, You Assholes” Day. Maybe we’ll be able to play this game legitimately by the time Bobby Bonilla stops making his million and change per year.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main components="[object Object]"><p>A part of me still hasn't recovered from learning that some people believe there is no such thing as an untranslatable word. I've written about why I disagree <a href="https://aethermug.com/posts/is-there-anything-untranslatable">before</a>, but that explanation didn't satisfy me completely. There was a stronger argument to be made, I thought, but I couldn't put it into words. Now I remember, though: you need to see language as (a little bit) like math. Call me crazy, but I think that language translation is like a change of basis in linear algebra.</p>
<p>Me making weird connections like this might simply be an occupational hazard. Both my PhD research and my first job had to do with controlling the position and orientation of spacecraft and rocks in space, which means that I spent years juggling vectors, matrix multiplications, and reference frames almost daily. Still, I think it is simple enough to be understood by anyone, so hear me out.</p>

<p><em>If the mere sight of the above is like a punch in the face for you, don't worry. I'm not going to math you to death in what follows. I will only remind you of a tiny basic part of it that I think relates to languages.)</em></p>
<p>During those same mathematical days, I was also learning Japanese. The language fascinated me for many reasons, like its <a href="https://aethermug.com/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language">beautiful dissociation</a> between written and spoken words and its <a href="https://aethermug.com/posts/i-like-the-sound-of-how-you-look-at-me">many</a> <a href="https://aethermug.com/posts/what-if-gratitude-was-built-into-the-grammar">unique</a> <a href="https://aethermug.com/posts/in-japanese-you-need-a-dictionary-to-count-things">quirks</a>, but I was also struck early on by something a bit more meta: how hard it is to translate things to and from it.</p>
<p>These two concurrent interests made it hard for me not to see a connection. For almost a decade now, I've held it in a corner of my mind without telling anyone, perhaps because I thought it would be seen as too outrageous, but hey! Now LLMs are popular and they <em>literally</em> handle words and concepts as vectors with linear algebra operations, so maybe my analogy isn't <em>that</em> out there. Let me give it a try.</p>
<h3>The Case of Vectors</h3>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, a vector is not "a list of numbers" but an abstract object with no predefined way to express it.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/linear-algebra-explains-why-some-words-are-effectively-untranslatable/vec_1.webp" alt="You can think of vectors as arrows floating in space. No numbers involved." title="Image of two vectors with the same origin but different directions, on a blank background. They are labeled a and b."><figcaption>You can think of vectors as arrows floating in space. No numbers involved.</figcaption></figure>
<p>But a vector is not very useful in this abstract state. We need a way to write it down so that we can manipulate it with algebra and communicate it to others. We do this by choosing a frame of reference—or, more accurately, a set of vectors to use as "basis" to quantify all others.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/linear-algebra-explains-why-some-words-are-effectively-untranslatable/vec_2.webp" alt="In the 2D case like this, if you set two vectors (e1 and e2) as the basis and decide that they have length 1, then you can find the coordinates of all other vectors based on their comparison to that basis. The basis vectors act as measuring sticks." title="Image of the same two vectors a and b, with the addition of two basis vectors titled e1 and e2 with the text 'length = 1'. Both the a and b vectors have lines projecting them perpendicularly against the e1 and e2 vectors, with numbers expressing what fraction of that vector's length the line intersects at."><figcaption>In the 2D case like this, if you set two vectors (e1 and e2) as the basis and decide that they have length 1, then you can find the coordinates of all other vectors based on their comparison to that basis. The basis vectors act as measuring sticks.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is where numbers come into play. By projecting the vectors against the basis vectors, you can assign them lists of numbers (two numbers each, in this two-dimensional case):</p>
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">a</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mtable rowspacing="0.16em" columnalign="center" columnspacing="1em"><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mn>0.5</mn></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mn>0.7</mn></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow><mo separator="true">,</mo><mspace width="1em"></mspace><mi mathvariant="bold">b</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mtable rowspacing="0.16em" columnalign="center" columnspacing="1em"><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mn>0.8</mn></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mn>0.3</mn></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 0.5 \\ 0.7 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 0.8 \\ 0.3 \end{pmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
<p>Those numbers are the <em>coordinates</em> of the vectors in that basis. For instance, the vector <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{a}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> can be read as "<em>half as long as the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">e</mi><mn mathvariant="bold">1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{e_1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> vector along the direction of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">e</mi><mn mathvariant="bold">1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{e_1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0.7</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0.7</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> times as long as the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">e</mi><mn mathvariant="bold">2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{e_2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> vector along the direction of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">e</mi><mn mathvariant="bold">2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{e_2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></em>."</p>
<p>The important thing I want to convey here (and the last mathy thing to remember) is that if you were to choose a different basis, the same vector would have different coordinates.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/linear-algebra-explains-why-some-words-are-effectively-untranslatable/vec_3.webp" alt="Same vectors, different basis: the numbers are different." title="Image of the same two vectors a and b, this time with a different pair of perpendicular basis vectors titled u1 and u2 with a different angle respect to the two in the previous image. The text still says 'length = 1' for these basis vectors. The lines projecting a and b perpendicularly against the u1 and u2 vectors now show different numbers."><figcaption>Same vectors, different basis: the numbers are different.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In this new basis, the two vectors are written as:</p>
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">a</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mtable rowspacing="0.16em" columnalign="center" columnspacing="1em"><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mn>0.8</mn></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mn>0.2</mn></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow><mo separator="true">,</mo><mspace width="1em"></mspace><mi mathvariant="bold">b</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mtable rowspacing="0.16em" columnalign="center" columnspacing="1em"><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mn>0.8</mn></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>0.2</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 0.8 \\ 0.2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 0.8 \\ -0.2 \end{pmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
<p>In short, change the basis (e.g. from "<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">e</mi><mn mathvariant="bold">1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{e_1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> &amp; <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">e</mi><mn mathvariant="bold">2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{e_2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>" to  "<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">u</mi><mn mathvariant="bold">1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{u_1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> &amp; <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="bold">u</mi><mn mathvariant="bold">2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{u_2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>") and the same abstract object (vector) will be represented with different numbers. You can do all the same operations with them, like changing the vector's length and direction, calculating the angle between the vectors, and so on, and you'll get the same results in both bases, because they are operations on the same objects. The choice of basis is merely cosmetic from this point of view.</p>
<h3>The Case of Language</h3>
<p>Now let's turn to language and see the parallel.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, a concept is not a word or a group of words but an abstract object in your mind.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/linear-algebra-explains-why-some-words-are-effectively-untranslatable/joukyou.webp" alt="A concept I have in mind now, shown as a drawing rather than words." title="AI drawing of a woman with a backpack walking under cherry blossoms, with a bullet train on the background."><figcaption>A concept I have in mind now, shown as a drawing rather than words.</figcaption></figure>
<p>But a concept is not very useful in this abstract state. We need a way to write it down so that we can manipulate it with grammar and communicate it to others. We do this by choosing a language that is shared with the receiver of the message.</p>
<p>For the concept in my head right now, and choosing the English language to represent it, you get this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"Going to Tokyo"</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is where words come into play. By projecting the abstract idea onto the standard English vocabulary and grammar, you can assign it a list of words:</p>
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>💭</mtext><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mtable rowspacing="0.16em" columnalign="center" columnspacing="1em"><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mtext>Going</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mtext>to</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mtext>Tokyo</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">💭 = \begin{pmatrix} \text{Going} \\ \text{to} \\ \text{Tokyo} \end{pmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
<p>Those words are the equivalent of the coordinates of the vectors in linear algebra. The way I just wrote it is not accurate, though, because it makes it look as if English only had 3 dimensions (3 words), just like the 2-element vectors were 2-dimensional. English actually has hundreds of thousands of words,  so we would need a vector that long to fully represent it, with blank spaces for all the words that aren't involved in this case.</p>
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>💭</mtext><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mtable rowspacing="0.16em" columnalign="center" columnspacing="1em"><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mtext>Going</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mtext>to</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mtext>Tokyo</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">⋮</mi><mpadded height="0em" voffset="0em"><mspace mathbackground="black" width="0em" height="1.5em"></mspace></mpadded></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">💭 = \begin{pmatrix} \text{Going} \\ \text{to} \\ \text{Tokyo} \\ \emptyset \\ \emptyset \\ \emptyset \\ \vdots \end{pmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
<p>The English language offers its speakers many other words, like <em>camel</em>, <em>frolic</em>, and <em>or</em>, but in this case none of them was necessary to express the idea that was in my mind, so they remain empty (<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\emptyset</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) and absent from my utterance of "going to Tokyo".</p>
<hr><figure id="floating-1"><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/linear-algebra-explains-why-some-words-are-effectively-untranslatable/vackground-com-F0qfw5H-pUU-unsplash.webp" alt="Abstract mosaic of irregular polygons in purple, pink, and white"><figcaption>Image by vackground.com, Unsplash</figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, similar to vectors with bases, you can express the same concept in a different language. If I chose Italian as the "basis", you'd get:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"Andare a Tokio"</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concept is the same, but now its representation (its "word coordinates") is different:</p>
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>💭</mtext><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mtable rowspacing="0.16em" columnalign="center" columnspacing="1em"><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mtext>Andare</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mtext>a</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mtext>Tokio</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mi mathvariant="normal">∅</mi></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">⋮</mi><mpadded height="0em" voffset="0em"><mspace mathbackground="black" width="0em" height="1.5em"></mspace></mpadded></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">💭 = \begin{pmatrix} \text{Andare} \\ \text{a} \\ \text{Tokio} \\ \emptyset \\ \emptyset \\ \emptyset \\ \vdots \end{pmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
<p>You can, in theory, say those two different sequences of sounds in those two languages, and obtain the same effect in the mind of the receiver. The only requirement is that all people involved know both languages.</p>
<h3>Cosmetics Matter</h3>
<p>Alright, the parallel seems plain enough. Sadly, expressing all language in that vector-like format would use up a lot of ink and is not really practical for everyday use. (LLMs kind of achieve that feat, but in a more convoluted and definitely not human-readable way.)</p>
<p>Why do I think it is interesting, then? Because "untranslatable" words exist.</p>
<p>The words that people sometimes call "untranslatable" are terms that have a clear and widely understood meaning in one language, but no equivalent in another one. I gave <a href="https://aethermug.com/posts/is-there-anything-untranslatable">some examples</a> from Japanese before, and the web is awash with blog posts <a href="https://www.rocketlanguages.com/blog/20-of-the-worlds-most-beautiful-untranslatable-words" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enumerating</a> curious words like that from many other languages. The key takeaway is that what only takes a single word in Language 1 can only be expressed with some accuracy in Language 2 if you use many words to explain them in all of their facets.</p>
<p>I wrote that the choice of basis in linear algebra is "cosmetic", because the result of an operation on vectors does not change depending on the basis. But that is only the ideal, mathematical way to look at it. We humans are not so ideal. We are weak and fallible and sometimes we even stink.</p>
<p>Which vector representation do you like better between these two?</p>
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">v</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mtable rowspacing="0.16em" columnalign="center" columnspacing="1em"><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mn>0.498213</mn></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mn>0.731212</mn></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 0.498213 \\ 0.731212 \end{pmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>

<p>Both represent the same vector under different bases, because I chose a base that has the vector <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{v}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> <em>as one of the basis vectors</em>. Here is what the two cases look like graphically:</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/linear-algebra-explains-why-some-words-are-effectively-untranslatable/vec_4.webp" alt="Left: a vector in a generic basis, with both components not zero. Right: the same vector in a basis where it is itself one of the basis vectors. In this case, the coordinates are 1 on the first component e1 (it is &quot;one times&quot; itself) and 0 on the other (there is &quot;nothing to project&quot; on it)." title="Images of a vector under two bases, shown side by side. One represents the vector in a generic basis, similar to the previous examples. The other shows the same vector in a basis where one of the basis vectors coincides exactly with the vector v. In this second case the projection onto the other basis vector is zero."><figcaption>Left: a vector in a generic basis, with both components not zero. Right: the same vector in a basis where it is itself one of the basis vectors. In this case, the coordinates are 1 on the first component e1 (it is "one times" itself) and 0 on the other (there is "nothing to project" on it).</figcaption></figure>
<p><em>In theory</em>, both representations are exactly equivalent to each other. A computer wouldn't have any preference. But the second representation, the clean one with a simple one and zero, is not only easier to remember and grasp for a person, but it is also easier to handle mathematically. Things simplify easily with it, everything that is multiplied by zero becomes zero, and similarly for the multiplications by one. The calculations proceed faster and with fewer errors.</p>
<p>This means that, at least for our feeble organic minds, the choice of basis does matter.</p>
<p>The same holds for language. A concept that took several words in English...</p>

<p>Looking at it in the other direction, a native word in one language is like one of its "basis vectors"—simple and straightforward—but the underlying concept might need to be "spread out" onto several words when applying a different language (i.e. "basis").</p>
<p>Arguably, having a compact word makes it easier not only to express the concept, but also to think about it. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Linguistic_relativity" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sapir-Whorf debate</a>, but I'll leave that for another day. Instead, I want to show you what this means for untranslatability, because there are people who vehemently deny their existence.</p>
<h3>Losing in Translation</h3>
<p>I think there are two ways in which this analogy makes it quite obvious that "practical untranslatability" is a thing.</p>
<p>First, communication is costly, and we don't have infinite time and space to put in all the words that are needed. Even if the word could <em>in theory</em> be explained in the other language, usually it's not worth it.</p>
<p>For example, the Japanese term <em>mono no aware</em> (物の哀れ) could be rather accurately translated as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a gentle, poignant sadness or pathos felt in response to the transient nature of all things, a deep awareness of their impermanence that evokes a subtle, bittersweet sorrow and a profound, quiet empathy for their passing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a dictionary, perhaps that's okay. But a dictionary is not translation. Translation is about conveying the meaning of full texts, and you can't do that kind of multi-line expansion for every word.</p>
<p>And so the translator simplifies it to the gist, e.g. as <em>the pathos of all things</em>. This conveys the majority of the meaning and it is usually enough, but it does lose a lot in the process.</p>
<p>This is exactly analogous to the data analysis technique called Principal Component Analysis (PCA), where one simplifies a vector by picking only its largest coordinates and disregarding all others. This means choosing a subset of the basis vectors that are more closely aligned with the vectors of interest, and ignoring the existence of the other basis vectors, effectively reducing the dimensions of the data. Translators use a version of PCA every time they (begrudgingly) accept to leave the finer nuances of a concept unsaid for the sake of space.</p>
<p>But, even assuming you <em>do</em> have time to explicate, using many more words increases the risk of introducing unintended nuances that come bundled with those extra words. This is like doing PCA but selecting inappropriate basis vectors, which introduce lots of small errors in the calculation of the vector's coordinates. Is "sorrow" too emotionally charged in that long translation of <em>mono no aware</em>? Does the use of "passing" unnecessarily remind English speakers of people dying?</p>
<p>You eventually hit diminishing returns: using more words confuses the reader instead of clarifying things further.</p>

<p>The second problem with translation is precision. Even if you can use many words, and even if none of those are misleading, words are still finite in number. Unlike ideal numerical coordinates, which can take any value down to the finest detail, you only have a small selection of words to convey a given bit of meaning.</p>
<p>Suppose you realize that the word "subtle" is not accurate enough in the "...evokes a subtle, bittersweet" part of the translation above. Maybe you do want to convey subtlety, but feel that the simple word "subtle" feels too strong in this case. You might try to soften it with an adverb, like "somewhat subtle" or "slightly subtle", but there aren't many other options out there. What if none of them is perfect for your current needs?</p>
<p>In this sense, language is "quantized": you can jump from one level of intensity of some meaning to the next, but you can't express anything in between.</p>
<p>This is a problem shared by all computers. Unlike ideal numbers, the numbers in a processor necessarily have a finite number of decimal places. So when you want to work with the ideal vector</p>

Right: how that vector might be stored if the smallest increment that the computer can store is the separation between the grid lines. This is a loss of accuracy.</figcaption></figure>
<p>(Incidentally, AI engineers sometimes intentionally quantize large language models to make them take up less memory, but this tends to make them dumber, because they lose nuance.)</p>
<p>With language, like with computers, we're forced to "lower the resolution" of our concepts whenever we put them into words. This happens twice in translated text: once when the author first writes down their thoughts, then once more when the translator transports that already-degraded concept into a different language with different "quantization steps".</p>
<h3>Between the Lines</h3>
<p>I hope these rather unorthodox leaps between linguistics and mathematics helped make it almost obvious that some words and ideas are untranslatable <em>in practice</em>. I also hope you don't take the analogy <em>too</em> seriously, because it won't go much further than this. You might be tempted to begin talking about "word matrices" and whatnot, but I doubt it would help clarify things. That kind of advanced linear algebra with concepts might work for LLMs, but it doesn't seem to map to anything intelligible for a human being, not to mention make you any wiser.</p>
<p>Besides, language has something going for it that doesn't seem to have a mathematical equivalent: what does it mean to "read between the lines"?</p>
<p>It's hard to pin down, but I think it has to do with the <em>structure</em> and <em>context</em> of the words communicating something that is not contained in any of the words themselves. Perhaps it is the clever use of those "negligible coordinates"—the fringe nuances—of words scattered around the text to produce a collective effect on the reader.</p>
<p>A good translator might not be able to exactly translate a given word or sentence, but they might be able to "write between the lines" so that it doesn't matter very much. ●</p>

		<p>Mozilla is developing a built‑in AI assistant for Firefox that will be offered as a third browsing mode alongside Normal and Private tabs. They’re calling it “Window AI.”</p>
<p>Details are still scarce. Based on Mozilla’s <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/firefox/ai-window/">official announcement</a> on Thursday (13<sup>th</sup>), it looks like a deeper implementation than the existing sidebar that gives access to third‑party chatbots (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, etc.). The post stresses the feature will be opt-in and that the user “is in control.”</p>
<p>There’s a <a href="https://www.firefox.com/en-US/ai/">waitlist</a> to try the feature and a Mozilla forum thread inviting people to “help shape” the initiative.</p>
<figure id="attachment_60904" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-60904"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/manualdousuario.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/window-ai-firefox.png?resize=320%2C271&amp;ssl=1" alt="Illustration showing Firefox’s three modes/windows: normal, “Window AI” and private window." width="320" height="271"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-60904">Image: Mozilla.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s safe to say that the people who volunteered to “shape” the initiative <a href="https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/discussions/building-ai-the-firefox-way-shaping-what-s-next-together/td-p/109922">want it dead and buried</a>. Of the 52 responses at the time of writing, *all* rejected the idea and asked Mozilla to stop shoving AI features into Firefox.</p>
<p>I don’t know whether the negative reactions reflect the majority of Firefox users or are just a noisy minority. Mozilla, after all, likely has a clearer view of the whole user base.</p>
<p>What strikes me as odd is the decision to position itself as just <a href="https://manualdousuario.net/en/web-browsers-ai-assistants/">another AI‑enabled web browser</a>, picking a fight with big techs and better‑funded startups whose users are less hostile (and sometimes enthusiastic) about adding AI to web browsing.</p>
<p>Mozilla seems to be trying to wedge itself between those who reject AI and those who want generative‑AI features in the browser — trying to please everyone — as this excerpt from the post shows:</p>
<blockquote><p>We see a lot of promise in AI browser features making your online experience smoother, more helpful, and free from the everyday disruptions that break your flow. But browsers made by AI companies ask you to make a hard choice — either use AI all the time or don’t use it at all.</p>
<p>We’re focused on making the best browser, which means recognizing that everyone has different needs. For some, AI is part of everyday life. For others, it’s useful only occasionally. And many are simply curious about what it can offer, but unsure where to start.</p>
<p>Regardless of your choice, with Firefox, you’re in control.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those unhappy have another option: use an AI‑free Firefox fork such as <a href="https://librewolf.net/">LibreWolf</a>, <a href="https://www.waterfox.net/">Waterfox</a>, or <a href="https://zen-browser.app/">Zen Browser</a>.</p>

  <i>
    <time datetime="2025-11-14">
      14 Nov 2025

  </i>
</p>
<p>Reading <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/460331/empire-of-ai-by-hao-karen/9780241678923"><em>Empire of AI</em> by Karen Hao</a>, I was struck by how people associated with OpenAI <em>believe</em> in AGI. They really do think someone, perhaps them, will build AGI, and that it will lead to either the flourishing or destruction of humanity.</p>
<p>Elon Musk founded OpenAI because he thought Demis Hassabis was an evil genius who would build AGI first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…Musk would regularly characterise Hassabis as a supervillain who needed to be stopped. Musk would make unequivocally clear that OpenAI was the good to DeepMind’s evil. … “He literally made a video game where an evil genius tries to create AI to take over the world,” Musk shouted [at an OpenAI off-site], referring to Hassabis’s 2004 title <em>Evil Genius</em>, “and fucking people don’t see it. Fucking people don’t see it! And Larry [Page]? Larry thinks he controls Demis but he’s too busy fucking windsurfing to realize that Demis is gathering the power.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OpenAI’s co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever regularly told audiences and employees to “feel the AGI”. At a company off-site in Yosemite in September 2022, employees gathered around a firepit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the pit, [Sutskever] had placed a wooden effigy that he’d commissioned from a local artist, and began a dramatic performance. This effigy, he explained represented a good, aligned AGI that OpenAI had built, only to discover it was actually lying and deceitful. OpenAI’s duty, he said, was to destroy it. … Sutskever doused the effigy in lighter fluid and lit on fire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s remarkable that what was until recently sci-fi fantasy has become a mainstream view in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Hao writes that GPT-2 was a bet on the “pure language” hypothesis, that asserts that since we communicate through language, then AGI should emerge from training a model solely on language. This is contrast to the “grounding” hypothesis, that asserts an AGI needs to perceive the world. Successfully scaling GPT to GPT-2 convinced enough people at OpenAI that the pure language hypothesis was valid. They just needed more data, more model parameters, and more compute.</p>
<p>So the belief in AGI, plus the recent results from LLMs, necessitates scaling, and justifies building data centres that <a href="https://restofworld.org/2024/data-centers-environmental-issues/">consume hundreds of litres of water a second</a>, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/08/xai_turbines_colossus/">run on polluting gas generators because the grid can’t supply the power</a> (<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/01/microsoft_openai_5gw_dc/">and might use as much power as entire cities</a>), driving up CO2 emissions from manufacture and operation of new hardware,&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/chatgpt-openai-content-abusive-sexually-explicit-harassment-kenya-workers-on-human-workers-cf191483">exploits and traumatises data workers</a> to make sure ChatGPT doesn’t generate outputs like child sexual abuse material and hate speech or encourage users to self-harm. (The thirst for data is so great that they stopped curating training data and instead consume the internet, warts and all, and manage the model output using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback">RLHF</a>.)</p>
<p>And this is all fine, because they’re going to make AGI and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value">expected value</a> (EV) of it will be huge! (Briefly, the argument goes that if there is a 0.001% chance of AGI delivering an extremely large amount of value, and 99.999% chance of much less or zero value, then the EV is still extremely large because <code>(0.001% * very_large_value) + (99.999% * small_value) = very_large_value</code>).</p>
<p>But AGI arguments based on EV are nonsensical because the values and probabilities are made up and unfalsifiable. They also ignore externalities like environmental damage, which in contrast to AGI, have known negative value and certain probability: costs borne by everyone else right now.</p>
<p>As a technologist I want to solve problems effectively (by bringing about the desired, correct result), efficiently (with minimal waste) and without harm (to people or the environment).</p>
<p>LLMs-as-AGI fail on all three fronts. The computational profligacy of LLMs-as-AGI is dissatisfying, and the exploitation of data workers and the environment unacceptable. Instead, if we drop the AGI fantasy, we can evaluate LLMs and other generative models as solutions for specific problems, rather than <em>all</em> problems, with proper cost benefit analysis. For example, by using smaller purpose-built generative models, or even discriminative (non-generative) models. In other words, make trade-offs and actually do engineering.</p>

<p id="15905113-780b-45b9-973e-ebd4fcdffa94">The launch of Nvidia's Vera Rubin platform for AI and HPC next year could mark significant changes in the AI hardware supply chain as Nvidia plans to ship its partners fully assembled Level-10 (L10) VR200 compute trays with all compute hardware, cooling systems, and interfaces pre-installed, according to J.P. Morgan (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1988821744476688410" target="_blank" data-url="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1988821744476688410" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link">@Jukanlosreve</a>). The move would leave major ODMs with very little design or integration work, making their lives easier, but would also trim their margins in favor of Nvidia's. The information remains unofficial at this stage.</p><p>Starting with the VR200 platform, Nvidia is reportedly preparing to take over production of fully built L10 compute trays with a pre-installed Vera CPU, Rubin GPUs, and a cooling system instead of allowing hyperscalers and ODM partners to build their own motherboards and cooling solutions. This would not be the first time the company has supplied its partners with a partially integrated server sub-assembly: it did so with its GB200 platform when it supplied the whole Bianca board with key components pre-installed. However, at the time, this could be considered as L7 – L8 integration, whereas now the company is reportedly considering going all the way to L10, selling the whole tray assembly — including accelerators, CPU, memory, NICs, power-delivery hardware, midplane interfaces, and liquid-cooling cold plates — as a pre-built, tested module.</p><div aria-hidden="false" data-swipeable="true" data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-imageGallery-Y3LG2dFhTnAx5ob7hkrRGF-mgegWfHHM1h56TlfWnMKmBOk64IMu0xv"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="false"><div><picture data-hydrate="true"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-normal="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf.jpg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-normal="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf.jpg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf.jpg" alt="Nvidia" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-normal="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf.jpg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW8XU6BHtKpxAmtGpNNbf.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"></picture></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nvidia/YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure></div><p id="0714a889-dac0-4681-bc70-1dc4e0bcd901">This move promises to shorten the ramp for VR200 as Nvidia's partners will not have to design everything in-house and could lower production costs due to the volume of scale ensured by a direct contract between Nvidia and an EMS (most likely Foxconn as the primary supplier and then Quanta and Wistron, but that is speculation). For example, a Vera Rubin Superchip board recently demonstrated by Jensen Huang uses a very complex design, a very thick PCB, and only solid-state components. Designing such a board takes time and costs a lot of money, so using select EMS provider(s) to build it makes a lot of sense.</p><p>J.P. Morgan reportedly mentions the increase in power consumption of one Rubin GPU from 1.4 kW (Blackwell Ultra) to 1.8 kW (R200) and even 2.3 kW (a previously unannounced TDP for an allegedly unannounced SKU (Nvidia declined a <em>Tom's Hardware </em>request for comment on the matter) and increased cooling requirements as one of the motivations for moving to supply the whole tray instead of individual components. However, we know from reported supply chain sources that various OEMs and ODMs, as well as hyperscalers like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a>, are experimenting with very advanced cooling systems, including immersion and embedded cooling, which underscores their experience.</p><p>However, Nvidia's partners will shift from being system designers to becoming system integrators, installers, and support providers.

<p>Every quarter, Drive Stats gives us the numbers. This quarter, it gave us a crisis of meaning. What does it really mean for a hard drive to fail? Is it the moment the lights go out, or the moment we decide they have? Philosophers might call that an ontological gray area. We just call it Q3.</p>



<p>As of June 30, 2025, we had 332,915 drives under management. Of that total, there were 3,970 boot drives and 328,348 data drives. Let’s dig into our stats, then talk about the meaning of failure.</p>

<h3>Notes and observations</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>The failure rate has increased: </strong>The failure rate has changed, and by quite a bit. As a reminder, last quarter’s AFR was 1.36% compared with this quarter’s 1.55%. (Interestingly, the <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-drive-stats-for-2024/">2024 yearly AFR</a> was 1.57%.)&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>That new drive energy: </strong>Say hello to the 24TB Toshiba MG11ACA24TE, joining the drive pool with 2,400 drives and 24,148 drive days. That means that we’ve hit the thresholds for the quarterly stats, but not the lifetime.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>The zero failure club: </strong>It was a big month for the zero failure club, with four drives making the cut:
<ul>
<li>Seagate HMS5C4040BLE640 (4TB)</li>



<li>Seagate ST8000NM000A (8TB)</li>



<li>Toshiba MG09ACA16TE (16TB)</li>



<li>Toshiba MG11ACA24TE (24TB)—and yes, that’s the new drive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>For those of you tracking the stats closely, you’ll notice that the Seagate ST8000NM000A (8TB) is a frequent flier on this list. The last time it had a failure was in <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-drive-stats-for-q3-2024/">Q3 2024</a>—and it was just a single failure for the whole quarter!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The highest AFRs were </strong><strong><em>really</em></strong><strong> high: </strong>The high end was so high that this month, it inspired us to run an outlier analysis using the standard quartile analysis (Tukey method). Based on that information, any drive with a quarterly AFR higher than 5.88% is an outlier, and there are three:
<ul>
<li>Seagate ST10000NM0086 (10TB): 7.97%</li>



<li>Seagate ST14000NM0138 (14TB): 6.86%</li>



<li>Toshiba MG08ACA16TEY (16TB): 16.95%</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>What’s going on there? Great question, and we’ll get into that after the lifetime failure rates.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Lifetime hard drive failure rates</h2>



<p>To be considered for the lifetime review, a drive model was required to have 500 or more drives as of the end of Q2 2025 and have over 100,000 accumulated drive days during their lifetime. When we removed those drive models which did not meet the lifetime criteria, we had drives grouped into 27 models remaining for analysis as shown in the table below.</p>

<h3>Notes and observations</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>That lifetime AFR is pretty consistent, isn’t it? </strong>The lifetime AFR is 1.31%. Last quarter we reported that it was 1.30%, and the quarter before that, it was 1.31%.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>The 4TB average age hasn’t shifted: </strong>As we’ve reported on previously, the 4TB drives are being decommissioned over time. Now, we’re down to just a handful left—just 11 of the ALE models and 187 of the BLE models. But, because their lifetime populations are so comparatively large, the additional drive days aren’t enough to move the needle on the average age in months. So, no ghosts in the machine here, and decommissioning is proceeding as planned.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Steady uptick in higher capacity drives</strong>: Of the 20TB+ drives that meet our lifetime data parameters, we’ve added 7,936 since last quarter. And, don’t forget that our newest entrée to the cohort, the Toshiba MG11ACA24TE (24TB), hasn’t made its way to this table yet—that adds an additional 2,400 drive models. All together, the 20TB+ club represents 67,939 drives, or about 21% of the drive pool.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Defining a failure—from a technical perspective</h2>



<p>A question that’s come up a few times when we’re hosting a webinar or chatting in the comments section is how we define a failure. While it may seem intuitive, it’s actually something of a meaty conundrum, and something we haven’t addressed since the early days of this series. Tracking down the answer to this question touches internal drive fleet monitoring tools (via SMART stats), the actual Drive Stats collection program, and our data engineering layer. I’ll dig into each of these in detail, then we’ll take a look at the outliers for this quarter.</p>



<h3>SMART stats reporting&nbsp;</h3>



<p>We use <a href="https://www.smartmontools.org/">Smartmontools</a> to collect the SMART attributes of drives, and another monitoring tool called drive sentinel to flag read/write errors that exceed a certain threshold as well as some other anomalies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main indicator we use for determining if a drive should be replaced is when it responds to reads with uncorrectable medium errors. When a drive reads the data from the disk, but the data fails its integrity check, the drive will try to reconstruct the data using internal error correction codes. If it is unable to reconstruct the data, it notifies the host by reporting it as an uncorrectable error and marks that part of the disk as pending reallocation, which shows up in SMART under an attribute like <code>Current_Pending_Sector</code>.</p>



<p>On Storage Pods that control drives through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SATA">SATA</a> links, the drive sentinel will count the number of these uncorrectable errors a drive reports and if it exceeds a threshold, access to the drive will be removed. This is important in the classic Backblaze Storage Pods where five drives share a single SATA link and errors by one drive will affect all drives on the link.</p>



<p>On Dell and SMCI pods that use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Attached_SCSI">SAS</a> topology to connect drives, drive sentinel doesn’t remove access to drives because the errors are reported differently; but, that’s also not as critical since SAS minimizes the impact that a problem disk can have on others.</p>



<h3>The Drive Stats program&nbsp;</h3>



<p>We’ve talked about the <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/overload-to-overhaul-how-we-upgraded-drive-stats-data/">custom program</a> we use to collect Drive Stats in the past, and here’s a quick recap:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The podstats generator runs on every Storage Pod, what we call any host that holds customer data, every few minutes. It’s a C++ program that collects SMART stats and a few other attributes, then converts them into an .xml file (“podstats”). Those are then pushed to a central host in each datacenter and bundled. Once the data leaves these central hosts, it has entered the domain of what we will call Drive Stats.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For this program, the logic is relatively simple: A failure in Drive Stats occurs when a drive vanishes out of the reporting population. It is considered “failed” until it shows up again. Drives are tracked by serial number and we report daily logs on a per-drive basis, so truly, we can get pretty granular here.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>The data engineering layer</h3>



<p>To recap, we’ve collected our SMART stats and compiled them with the podstats program. Now we’ve got all the information, and data intelligence needs to add the context. A drive may go offline for a day or so (not return a response to those tools that collect daily logs of SMART stats), but it could be something as simple as a loose cable. So, time-wise, if a drive reappears after one day or 30, at what point in that period of time do we classify it as an official failure?</p>



<p>Previously, we manually cross-referenced data center work tickets, but these days, we’ve automated that process. On the backend, it’s a SQL query, but in human speak, this is what it comes down to:</p>



<ol>
<li>If a drive logs data on the last day of the selection period (which in this case is a quarter) then it has not failed.</li>



<li>There are three human-curated tables that the query cross references. If a drive serial number appears on one of them, it tells us whether there’s a failure or not (depending on the table’s function).&nbsp;</li>



<li>If the drive serial number is the primary serial number in a drive replacement Jira ticket then it has failed. (Jira is where we track our data center work tickets.)</li>



<li>If the drive serial number is the target serial number in a clone Jira ticket or a (temp) replacement ticket, then it has not failed.</li>
</ol>



<p>Basically, when we go to write the Drive Stats reports at the end of the quarter, if a drive has either appeared in one of our various work trackers or hasn’t re-entered the population, then it’s considered failed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In rare instances, that can mean that we have so-called “cosmetic” failures when we have some work we’re doing on a drive model that lasts more than that quarterly collection period. And, spoiler, we have one of those instances that showed up in the data this month—our outlier Toshiba drive with the 16.9% failure rate. We’ll dig in in just a minute; but first, some context.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Connecting drive failure to overall picture of the drive pool&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As we mentioned above, certain drives in the pool had such high swings in AFR that we ended up running an outlier analysis using the quartile method. (It’s also worth mentioning that a cluster analysis could potentially be a better fit, but we can save that for another day.) Based on that analysis, anything that has above a 5.88% failure rate is an outlier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The primary motivation was inspired by an attempt to visualize the relationship between the age in months of a drive versus this quarter’s AFRs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And yes, we’re fully aware that that’s a… super unreadable scatter plot. Removing the labels, this is a bit better:&nbsp;</p>


<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;6917570b8731b&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="489" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Age-in-months-vs.-quarterly-failure-rates-1-2-1024x489.png" alt="A scatter plot that shows the relationship between the age in months of a drive versus this quarter’s AFRs" srcset="https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Age-in-months-vs.-quarterly-failure-rates-1-2-1024x489.png 1024w, https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Age-in-months-vs.-quarterly-failure-rates-1-2-300x143.png 300w, https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Age-in-months-vs.-quarterly-failure-rates-1-2-768x367.png 768w, https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Age-in-months-vs.-quarterly-failure-rates-1-2.png 1072w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>We’re interested, really, in the shape of the relationship. If we posit that the older drives get, the higher their failure rates, you’d expect a larger concentration in the top right quadrant. But, our data follows a much more interesting pattern than that, with most of our data points concentrated in the lowest regions of the graph regardless of age—something you’d expect from a set of data that reflects a bunch of smart folks actively working towards the goal of a healthy drive population.&nbsp;And yet, we have some data points that break the mold. </p>



<p>As is pretty intuitive to my business intelligence folks in the audience, the process of identifying outliers is actionable data as well. Just like all press is good press; in our world, more data is more better. So, let’s take a closer look at those outliers. As a reminder, that’s these three drive models:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Seagate ST10000NM0086 (10TB): 7.97%</li>



<li>Seagate ST14000NM0138 (14TB): 6.86%</li>



<li>Toshiba MG08ACA16TEY (16TB): 16.95%</li>
</ul>



<h3>Seagate ST10000NM0086 (10TB)</h3>



<p>This drive has some pretty explainable factors for the high failure rate. It’s well over seven years old (92.35 months). And, since it only has 1,018 drive models in operation, single failures hold a lot of weight compared with the average drive count per model—which comes in at 10,952 if you use the mean of this quarterly data and 6,177 if you use the median.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, you can see that borne out in the trend in the last year of data:&nbsp;</p>


<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;6917570b87966&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="648" height="337" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Seagate-ST10000NM0086-10TB.png" alt="A chart showing the failure rates for drive model Seagate-ST10000NM0086-10TB for the last year. " srcset="https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Seagate-ST10000NM0086-10TB.png 648w, https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Seagate-ST10000NM0086-10TB-300x156.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px"></figure></div>


<h3>Seagate ST14000NM0138 (14TB)</h3>



<p>This drive is nearing five years in age (56.57 months) and, again, has a lower drive count at 1,286. More importantly, this particular drive model has had historically high failure rates. In parallel with above, here’s the last year of quarterly failure rates:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;6917570b8809b&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="648" height="321" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Seagate-ST14000NM0138-14TB.png" alt="A chart showing the failure rates for the drive model Seagate-ST14000NM0138-14TB for the last year." srcset="https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Seagate-ST14000NM0138-14TB.png 648w, https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Seagate-ST14000NM0138-14TB-300x149.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px"></figure></div>


<h3>Toshiba MG08ACA16TEY (16TB)</h3>



<p>Finally, our Toshiba model is the most interesting of all. It’s less than four years old (44.61 months), and has 5,145 drives in the pool. And, this quarter is clearly a change from its normal, decent, AFRs.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;6917570b885ad&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="520" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Toshiba-MG08ACA16TEY-16TB-1-1-1024x520.png" alt="A line graph of the Toshiba MG08ACA16TEY failure rates from Q3 2024 to Q3 2025" srcset="https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Toshiba-MG08ACA16TEY-16TB-1-1-1024x520.png 1024w, https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Toshiba-MG08ACA16TEY-16TB-1-1-300x152.png 300w, https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Toshiba-MG08ACA16TEY-16TB-1-1-768x390.png 768w, https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Toshiba-MG08ACA16TEY-16TB-1-1.png 1151w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>When we see deviations like this one, it’s usually an indication that there’s something afoot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Never fear, Drive Stats fans; this was a known quantity before we went on this journey. This past quarter, working with Toshiba, we deployed some firmware updates they provided to optimize performance on these drives. Because we needed to pull drives to achieve this in some cases, we had an abnormal number of “failed” drives in this population.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What that means for <em>this </em>drive is that it’s actually not a bad drive model; and, given the ways we and Toshiba have worked together on a fix, we should see failure rates normalizing in the near future. And, this also goes back to our conversation of defining a failure—in this case, while the drives “failed,” the failure wasn’t mechanical and <em>was </em>based on something that we’ll be able to fix without replacing the drives. In short, don’t sweat the spike and pay attention to the long arc of performance on this population. We expect to see those drives happy and spinning for years to come (and with better performance, too).&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let’s talk about memory management!  Following up on my article about <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2023/12/07/the-last-5-years-of-v8s-garbage-collector">5 years of developments in V8’s garbage
collector</a>, today I’d like to bring that up to date with what went down in V8’s GC over the last couple years.</p><h3>methodololology</h3><p>I selected all of the commits to <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/heap/"><tt>src/heap</tt></a> since my previous roundup.
There were 1600 of them, including reverts and relands.  I read all of
the commit logs, some of the changes, some of the linked bugs, and any
design document I could get my hands on.  From what I can tell, there
have been about 4 FTE from Google over this period, and the commit rate
is fairly constant.  There are very occasional patches from Igalia,
Cloudflare, Intel, and Red Hat, but it’s mostly a Google affair.</p><p>Then, by the very rigorous process of, um, just writing things down and
thinking about it, I see three big stories for V8’s GC over this time,
and I’m going to give them to you with some made-up numbers for how much
of the effort was spent on them.  Firstly, the effort to improve memory
safety via the sandbox: this is around 20% of the time.  Secondly, the
Oilpan odyssey: maybe 40%.  Third, preparation for multiple JavaScript
and WebAssembly mutator threads: 20%.  Then there are a number of lesser
side quests: heuristics wrangling (10%!!!!), and a long list of
miscellanea.  Let’s take a deeper look at each of these in turn.</p><h3>the sandbox</h3><p>There was a nice blog post in June last year summarizing the <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/sandbox">sandbox
effort</a>: basically, the goal is to prevent
user-controlled writes from corrupting memory outside the JavaScript
heap.  We start from the assumption that the user is
somehow able to obtain a write-anywhere primitive, and we work to mitigate
the effect of such writes.  The most fundamental way is to reduce the
range of addressable memory, notably by encoding pointers as 32-bit
offsets and then ensuring that no host memory is within the addressable
virtual memory that an attacker can write.  The sandbox also uses some
40-bit offsets for references to larger objects, with similar
guarantees.  (Yes, a sandbox really does reserve a terabyte of virtual memory).</p><p>But there are many, many details.  Access to external objects is
intermediated via type-checked <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2024/05/13/partitioning-pitfalls-for-generational-collectors">external pointer
tables</a>.
Some objects that should never be directly referenced by user code go in
a separate “trusted space”, which is outside the sandbox.  Then you have
read-only spaces, used to allocate data that might be shared between
different isolates, <a href="https://dbezhetskov.dev/multi-sandboxes/">you might want multiple
cages</a>, there are “shared”
variants of the other spaces, for use in shared-memory multi-threading,
executable code spaces with embedded object references, and so on and so
on.  Tweaking, elaborating, and maintaining all of these details has
taken a lot of V8 GC developer time.</p><p>I think it has paid off, though, because the new development is that <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/350324877">V8
has managed to turn on hardware memory protection for the
sandbox</a>: sandboxed code
is prevented by the hardware from writing memory outside the sandbox.</p><p>Leaning into the “attacker can write anything in their address space”
threat model has led to some funny patches.  For example, sometimes code
needs to check flags about the page that an object is on, as part of a
write barrier.  So some GC-managed metadata needs to be in the sandbox.
However, the garbage collector itself, which is outside the sandbox,
can’t trust that the metadata is valid.  We end up having two copies of
state in some cases: in the sandbox, for use by sandboxed code, and
outside, for use by the collector.</p><p>The best and most amusing instance of this phenomenon is related to
integers.  <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Integer_Types">Google’s style guide recommends signed integers by
default</a>,
so you end up with on-heap data structures with <tt>int32_t len</tt> and such.
But if an attacker overwrites a length with a negative number, there are
a couple funny things that can happen.  The first is a <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/425896305">sign-extending
conversion to <tt>size_t</tt> by run-time
code</a>, which can lead to
sandbox escapes.  The other is <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/5335156">mistakenly concluding that an object is
small, because its length is less than a limit, because it is
unexpectedly
negative</a>.
Good times!</p><h3>oilpan</h3><p>It took 10 years for Odysseus to get back from Troy, which is about as
long as it has taken for conservative stack scanning to make it from
<a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8/+/main/include/cppgc/README.md">Oilpan</a>
into V8 proper.  Basically, Oilpan is garbage collection for C++ as used
in Blink and Chromium.  Sometimes it runs when the stack is empty; then
it can be precise.  But sometimes it runs when there might be references
to GC-managed objects on the stack; in that case it runs conservatively.</p><p>Last time I <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2023/12/07/the-last-5-years-of-v8s-garbage-collector">described how V8 would like to add support for generational
garbage collection to
Oilpan</a>,
but that for that, you’d need a way to promote objects to the old
generation that is compatible with the ambiguous references visited by
conservative stack scanning.  I thought V8 had a chance at success with
their new <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2023/12/08/v8s-mark-sweep-nursery">mark-sweep
nursery</a>,
but that seems to have turned out to be a lose relative to the copying
nursery.  They even tried <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2022/10/22/the-sticky-mark-bit-algorithm">sticky mark-bit generational
collection</a>,
but it <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/333906585">didn’t work out</a>.
Oh well; one good thing about Google is that they seem willing to try
projects that have uncertain payoff, though I hope that the hackers
involved came through their OKR reviews with their mental health intact.</p><p>Instead, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UHe6Ac60lnOshlgfP4XG6GXeh7szqbxPl4uu1x4i1EY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.n1atlriavj6v">V8 added support for pinning to the Scavenger copying nursery
implementation</a>.
If a page has incoming ambiguous edges, it will be placed in a kind of
quarantine area for a while.  I am not sure what the difference is
between a quarantined page, which logically belongs to the nursery, and
a pinned page from the mark-compact old-space; they seem to require
similar treatment.  In any case, we seem to have settled into a design
that was mostly the same as before, but in which any given page can opt
out of evacuation-based collection.</p><p>What do we get out of all of this?  Well, not only can we get
generational collection for Oilpan, but also we unlock cheaper, less
bug-prone <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/42203211">“direct
handles”</a> in V8 itself.</p><p>The funny thing is that I don’t think any of this is shipping yet; or,
if it is, it’s only in a <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/chrome-finch">Finch
trial</a> to a
minority of users or something.  I am looking forward in interest to
seeing a post from upstream V8 folks; <a href="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/studentTheses/retro-fitting-conservative-garbage-collection/">whole doctoral theses have been
written on this
topic</a>,
and it would be a delight to see some actual numbers.</p><h3>shared-memory multi-threading</h3><p>JavaScript implementations have had the luxury of a single-threadedness:
with just one mutator, garbage collection is a lot simpler.  But this is
ending.  I don’t know what the state of <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-structs">shared-memory multi-threading
is in JS</a>, but in WebAssembly
it <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/shared-everything-threads">seems to be moving
apace</a>, and
Wasm uses the JS GC.  Maybe I am overstating the effort here—probably it
doesn’t come to 20%—but <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/42204563">wiring this up has been a whole
thing</a>.</p><p>I will mention just one patch here that I found to be funny.  So with
pointer compression, an object’s fields are mostly 32-bit words, with
the exception of 64-bit doubles, so we can reduce the alignment on most
objects to 4 bytes.  <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40644235">V8 has had a bug open forever about alignment of
double-holding objects</a>
that it mostly ignores via unaligned loads.</p><p>Thing is, if you have an object visible to multiple threads, and that
object might have a 64-bit field, then the field should be 64-bit
aligned to prevent tearing during atomic access, which usually means the
object should be 64-bit aligned.  <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/6540510">That is now the
case</a> for
Wasm structs and arrays in the shared space.</p><h3>side quests</h3><p>Right, we’ve covered what to me are the main stories of V8’s GC over the
past couple years.  But let me mention a few funny side quests that I
saw.</p><h4>the heuristics two-step</h4><p>This one I find to be hilariousad.  Tragicomical.  Anyway I am amused.
So any real GC has a bunch of heuristics: when to promote an object or a
page, when to kick off incremental marking, how to use background
threads, when to grow the heap, how to choose whether to make a minor or
major collection, when to aggressively reduce memory, how much virtual
address space can you reasonably reserve, what to do on hard
out-of-memory situations, how to account for off-heap mallocated memory,
how to compute whether concurrent marking is going to finish in time or if you need to pause... and V8 needs to do
this all in all its many configurations, with pointer compression off or
on, on desktop, high-end Android, low-end Android, iOS where everything
is weird, something called Starboard which is apparently part of Cobalt
which is apparently a whole new platform that Youtube uses to show
videos on set-top boxes, on machines with different memory models and
operating systems with different interfaces, and on and on and on.
Simply tuning the system appears to involve a dose of science, a dose of
flailing around and trying things, and a whole cauldron of witchcraft.
There appears to be one person whose full-time job it is to implement
and monitor metrics on V8 memory performance and implement appropriate
tweaks.  Good grief!</p><h4>mutex mayhem</h4><p>Toon Verwaest noticed that V8 was exhibiting many more context switches
on MacOS than Safari, and identified V8’s use of platform mutexes as the
problem.  So he rewrote them to use
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/os_unfair_lock"><tt>os_unfair_lock</tt></a>
on MacOS.  Then <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/384940357">implemented adaptive locking on all
platforms</a>.
Then... <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/6175168">removed it all and switched to
abseil</a>.</p><p>Personally, I am delighted to see this patch series, I wouldn’t have
thought that there was juice to squeeze in V8’s use of locking.  It
gives me hope that I will find a place to do the same in one of my
projects :)</p><h4>ta-ta, third-party heap</h4><p>It used to be that <a href="https://mmtk.io/">MMTk</a> was trying to get a number of
production language virtual machines to support abstract APIs so that
MMTk could slot in a garbage collector implementation.  Though this
seems to work with OpenJDK, with V8 I think the churn rate and
laser-like focus on the browser use-case makes an interstitial API
abstraction a lose.  V8 <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/5797605">removed it a little more than a year
ago</a>.</p><h3>fin</h3><p>So what’s next?  I don’t know; it’s been a while since I have been to Munich to drink from the source.  That said, shared-memory multithreading and <a href="https://wasmfx.dev/">wasm effect handlers</a> will extend the memory management hacker’s full employment act indefinitely, not to mention actually landing and shipping conservative stack scanning.  There is a lot to be done in non-browser V8 environments, whether in Node or on the edge, but it is admittedly harder to read the future than the past.</p><p>In any case, it was fun taking this look back, and perhaps I will have the opportunity to do this again
in a few years.  Until then, happy hacking!</p></div></div>]]></description>
