<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">This floor is made up of a bunch of tiles that all work to keep people in the center of them.</h2></div><section><p>Alongside announcing that Lanny Smoot will be the first Disney employee besides Walt to be inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, Disney also shared one of his newest projects called the HoloTile floor, which just may be a game changer for VR and could bring us ever closer to experiencing the Holodeck from Star Trek.</p><p>Disney shared the news and <a href="https://youtu.be/68YMEmaF0rs?si=NJuK14JuvqIKzsa0&amp;t=182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a video of the HoloTile floor in action</a> in <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/lanny-smoot-to-be-the-first-disney-imagineer-inducted-into-the-national-inventors-hall-of-fame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog celebrating Smoot,</a> who holds over 100 patents and secured 74 of those during his 25 years at The Walt Disney Company.</p><p>As for the HoloTile floor itself, it is described by Disney as the "world’s first multi-person, omni-directional, modular, expandable, treadmill floor." You have to think of it like a floor made of many tiles that do all they can to keep people or objects in the center of them. This could allow people to "have a shared virtual reality (VR) experience, walk an unlimited distance in any direction, and never collide or walk off its surface."</p><p>Many of us have experienced the joy that can be a really stellar VR experience, but there are always certain limitations to the immersion that comes with it. While it's great to be able to visit The Black Spire Outpost on the planet of Batuu in Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge in VR, you also run the risk of being pulled back to Earth when you bump into your couch and can only move a few feet here and there.</p><p>With the HoloTile floor, Disney appears to be envisioning a future where those limitations are no more and we can explore wide environments and feel that we are actually walking or running through them despite us staying mostly in one place. For those Star Trek fans out there, this sounds a lot like the promise of the Holodeck, a smallish-room that could virtually take our favorite crews wherever they wanted for some fun and relaxation between missions when it wasn't malfunctioning and trying to murder them. </p><p>The HoloTile floor can do more than just let people walk on it, as it can also move objects around. <a href="https://youtu.be/68YMEmaF0rs?si=ntNM2LGdnNktkZQE&amp;t=257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In the video,</a> we see an object being moved around the floor and an arm extending at the corner of the screen, as if they were using the Force to move an object. Yes, the possibilities of this are making a Star Wars fan like myself VERY happy. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/01/23/floor-1706037202625.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" alt="Lanny Smoot on the HoloTile Floor.

Image Credit: The Walt Disney Company</figcaption></figure></output><p>The applications of the HoloTile floor also extend beyond virtual reality, as Disney notes "The HoloTile floor can also be an insert in a theatrical stage, allowing performers to move and dance in new ways, or stage props and structures to move around or appear to set themselves up."</p><p>However, it's important not to get too excited yet as Smoot notes "we don't know yet where that will be used." So, while we may have to wait a while to see what this tech could become, its an exciting glimpse into the future that could hopefully one day change how we experience our favorite universes in Disney Parks, our homes, and beyond.</p><p><em>Adam Bankhurst is a news writer for IGN.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://brave.com/leo-mixtral/">https://brave.com/leo-mixtral/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39152763">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>With today’s desktop browser update (v1.62), we are excited to announce that we have integrated Mixtral 8x7B as the default large language model (LLM) in <a href="https://brave.com/leo/">Leo</a>, our recently released, privacy-preserving AI browser assistant. <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mixtral 8x7B</a> is an open source LLM released by <a href="https://mistral.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mistral AI</a> this past December, and has already seen broad usage due to its speed and performance. In addition, we’ve made several improvements to the Leo user experience, focusing on clearer onboarding, context controls, input and response formatting, and general UI polish.</p>

<h2 id="unveiling-mixtral-8x7b">Unveiling Mixtral 8x7B</h2>
<p>Mixtral is now the default LLM for all Leo users, for the free version and the Premium version ($15/month). The free version is rate limited, and subscribers to Leo Premium benefit from higher rate limits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mixtral 8x7B quickly gained popularity and usage among the developer community since its December release. Mixtral 8x7B currently outperforms ChatGPT 3.5, Claude Instant, Llama 2, and many others, according to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard</a>. Mixtral also shows improvements in reducing hallucinations and biases, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the BBQ benchmark</a>.</p>
<p>Among other benefits, Mixtral can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle larger contexts</li>
<li>Interact in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish</li>
<li>Generate code</li>
</ul>
<p>Brave is already using Mixtral for its newly released <a href="https://brave.com/codellm/">Code LLM</a> feature for programming-related queries in <a href="https://brave.com/search/">Brave Search</a>, and the combination of Mixtral’s performance with its open source nature made it a natural fit for integration in Leo, given Brave’s commitment to open models and the open source community.</p>
<p>“Since its release, Brave Leo has been adopted by tens of thousands of free tier users and paid subscribers, and we expect even greater adoption as we expand our availability of LLMs to include Mixtral,” said Brian Bondy, CTO and co-founder at Brave. “Our aim is to create novel and convenient use cases in the context of users’ browsing sessions, and to help our users interact with the Web in groundbreaking ways.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We are very happy to see Mixtral being used to power CodeLLM in Brave Search, and to now have Mixtral integrated in Brave Leo,” said Arthur Mensch, CEO at Mistral Al. “Making Mixtral available as an open model enables Brave to easily integrate it and to fulfill their users’ growing AI needs.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="giving-leo-users-choice-with-a-variety-of-llms">Giving Leo users choice with a variety of LLMs</h2>
<p>Unlike other AI assistants, Brave Leo offers its users the flexibility to choose from different models according to their needs and budget. While we’ve added Mixtral 8x7B as the default LLM for both the free and premium versions of Brave Leo, we also offer Claude Instant from Anthropic in the free version (with rate limits) and for Premium. The free and premium versions of Leo also feature the Llama 2 13B model from Meta.</p>
<p>With Mixtral’s integration, Leo users will notice a significant performance improvement in the answer/result quality. Regarding the free Leo version, users will also have the option to revert to the previous Leo experience with Llama 2 and continue their AI experience once they reach the rate limits for Mixtral.</p>

<h2 id="privacy-always-comes-first">Privacy always comes first</h2>
<p>Privacy remains paramount for Brave Leo. Chats with Leo are private, anonymous, and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. Privacy protections in Leo include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reverse proxy</strong>: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user-address cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</li>
<li><strong>Immediate discarding of responses</strong>: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded immediately after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers such as your IP Address that can be linked to you. No personal data is retained by the AI model or any 3rd-party model providers.</li>
<li><strong>No login or account required for access</strong>: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Unlinkable subscription</strong>: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ready-to-try-brave-leo">Ready to try Brave Leo?</h2>
<p>It’s easy to get started with Brave Leo because it’s built right into the browser, so no extra apps or extensions are required. Leo provides seamless access to AI experiences via the browser address bar, or as a sidebar, chat-like interface positioned beside any webpage. Leo helps users with all sorts of tasks in the context of the page they are on by creating real-time summaries of webpages or videos. Leo can also answer questions about content, generate new content, translate pages, analyze them, and rewrite them. Whether you’re looking for information, trying to solve a problem, writing code, or creating content, Leo is integrated in the browser for enhanced productivity.</p>
<p>To access Leo, Brave desktop users can simply ask a question in the address bar and click <span title="Ask Leo icon"></span> “Ask Leo”, or click <img width="24" src="https://brave.com/leo-icons/product-brave-leo.svg" alt="Brave Leo sidebar icon"> in the Brave Sidebar.</p>
<p>Leo has been available to Brave desktop users since November (<a href="https://brave.com/leo-launch/">version 1.60</a>). Leo will be available on mobile (Android and iOS) soon. Learn more about <a href="https://brave.com/leo/">Brave Leo</a>, or see a <a href="https://brave.com/leo-roadmap/">roadmap</a> for Leo.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would like to inform you that the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) is expected to end this spring unless Congress appropriates additional funding. As a result, the FCC has begun taking steps to wind down the ACP. The FCC projects that households enrolled in the ACP will continue to receive the benefit on their internet service through April 2024. This date is an estimate and may change.</p><p>In 2021, Congress established the Affordable Connectivity Program in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and appropriated $14.2 billion for the program. The FCC was tasked to develop and implement the ACP as well as ACP outreach and awareness activities. As of today, over 22 million households are enrolled and receiving the ACP monthly benefit.</p><p><strong>What’s happening?</strong><br>Without additional funding from Congress, the FCC anticipates that the current ACP funding is projected to run out in April 2024. This date is an estimate and may change. As a result, the FCC has begun taking steps to wind down the ACP, which means:</p><ul><li>No new ACP enrollments will be accepted after February 7, 2024 at 11:59 PM ET.</li><li>Households that enrolled with an ACP internet company before February 7, 2024 at 11:59 PM ET will continue to receive their ACP benefit until ACP funds run out as long as the household remains enrolled and eligible for the benefit.</li><li>When ACP funds run out, households participating in the ACP will no longer receive the ACP discounts.</li></ul><p><strong>What should ACP households expect?</strong><br>All households enrolled in the ACP will continue to receive the benefit on their internet service until ACP funding, which is currently projected through April 2024, runs out.</p><p>Eligible households who wish to receive the ACP benefit but have not yet applied for the program should submit a completed ACP application as soon as possible to allow time for processing so that an eligibility determination can be made and the eligible household can sign up with an internet company by February 7, 2024 at 11:59 PM ET. To reiterate – during this program wind-down period, households must BOTH submit their application on a timely basis in order to be approved AND if qualified sign up with an ACP-eligible internet company by February 7, 2024 at 11:59 PM ET to receive the benefit.</p><p>During the ACP wind-down period, ACP households will receive notices from their internet company about the impact of the end of the benefit on the household’s bill and service. The notices will include:</p><ul><li>That the ACP is ending,</li><li>The impact on their bill,</li><li>The date of the last bill they will receive that includes the ACP benefit, and</li><li>That they may change their service or opt-out of continuing service after the end of the ACP.</li></ul><p>ACP households will also receive notices from the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), the administrator of the ACP.</p><p>ACP households may also switch their internet plans without penalty.</p><p><strong>How can you help?</strong><br>Share this <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/ACP_Wind-down_Fact_Sheet_Final.pdf">ACP Wind-Down Fact Sheet</a> to help spread the word, also found at: <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/acp">www.fcc.gov/acp</a>.

<h2 id="about">About rclone</h2>
<p>Rclone is a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage. It
is a feature-rich alternative to cloud vendors' web storage
interfaces. <a href="#providers">Over 70 cloud storage products</a> support
rclone including S3 object stores, business &amp; consumer file storage
services, as well as standard transfer protocols.</p>
<p>Rclone has powerful cloud equivalents to the unix commands rsync, cp,
mv, mount, ls, ncdu, tree, rm, and cat. Rclone's familiar syntax
includes shell pipeline support, and <code>--dry-run</code> protection. It is
used at the command line, in scripts or via its <a href="https://rclone.org/rc">API</a>.</p>
<p>Users call rclone <em>"The Swiss army knife of cloud storage"</em>, and
<em>"Technology indistinguishable from magic"</em>.</p>
<p>Rclone really looks after your data. It preserves timestamps and
verifies checksums at all times. Transfers over limited bandwidth;
intermittent connections, or subject to quota can be restarted, from
the last good file transferred. You can
<a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_check/">check</a> the integrity of your files. Where
possible, rclone employs server-side transfers to minimise local
bandwidth use and transfers from one provider to another without
using local disk.</p>
<p>Virtual backends wrap local and cloud file systems to apply
<a href="https://rclone.org/crypt/">encryption</a>,
<a href="https://rclone.org/compress/">compression</a>,
<a href="https://rclone.org/chunker/">chunking</a>,
<a href="https://rclone.org/hasher/">hashing</a> and
<a href="https://rclone.org/union/">joining</a>.</p>
<p>Rclone <a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/">mounts</a> any local, cloud or
virtual filesystem as a disk on Windows,
macOS, linux and FreeBSD, and also serves these over
<a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_sftp/">SFTP</a>,

<a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_ftp/">FTP</a> and
<a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_dlna/">DLNA</a>.</p>
<p>Rclone is mature, open-source software originally inspired by rsync
and written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>. The friendly support
community is familiar with varied use cases. Official Ubuntu, Debian,
Fedora, Brew and Chocolatey repos. include rclone. For the latest
version <a href="https://rclone.org/downloads/">downloading from rclone.org</a> is recommended.</p>
<p>Rclone is widely used on Linux, Windows and Mac. Third-party
developers create innovative backup, restore, GUI and business
process solutions using the rclone command line or API.</p>
<p>Rclone does the heavy lifting of communicating with cloud storage.</p>

Soldati was relieved when the Dover District Court finally released its decision Jan. 19.</p><p>“When I filed the initial small claim in 2018, I was in my 20s and now I’m not in my 20s, I had hair on my head and now I don’t have hair on my head,” Soldati said. “I just sort of feel like, how on earth did this take so long?”</p><media-image image-set="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/2020/03/10/NPOH/ghows-SO-f7b5646c-40a8-4a99-abfc-f09567afb0c5-0acaac9d.jpeg bestCrop, https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/2020/03/10/NPOH/ghows-SO-f7b5646c-40a8-4a99-abfc-f09567afb0c5-0acaac9d.jpeg?crop=4021,3023,x5,y0 4:3, https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/2020/03/10/NPOH/ghows-SO-f7b5646c-40a8-4a99-abfc-f09567afb0c5-0acaac9d.jpeg?crop=2268,3023,x882,y0 3:4, https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/2020/03/10/NPOH/ghows-SO-f7b5646c-40a8-4a99-abfc-f09567afb0c5-0acaac9d.jpeg?crop=4031,2277,x0,y373 16:9" image-alt="" credit="Portsmouth Herald" caption="Emmett Soldati, owner of Teatotaller cafe, has won his case against Meta (formerly Facebook) over deleting the business's Instagram account, representing himself in court." orientation="horizontal" util-module-path="elements/media"></media-image><p>Soldati’s win wasn’t just a win for him, he said, but a win for all Instagram users and small business owners who have faced similar problems with the tech company.</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><h2>Why did Soldati file a claim against Facebook?</h2><p>Teatotaller, which has been described on Yelp as a “queer, hipster oasis of tea, coffee, and pastry goodness,” first opened in 2011 in Somersworth. It has since closed in Somersworth and now has locations in Dover and Concord. From the beginning, Soldati's business used Instagram heavily as a way to engage and find customers.</p><p>By 2018, Teatotaller had a large following to whom it promoted shows, specials, and other items. Soldati paid Instagram and Facebook for use of the professional platform.</p><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><cta-atoms-container-inline util-module-path="elements/cta"></cta-atoms-container-inline><p>When he first found himself unable to log in to his account in June 2018, he thought there was some kind of technical glitch.</p><p>“Over the course of 24 hours realizing it was deleted, I was very concerned,” Soldati said. All users could see when they tried to look at the account was a blank screen. “And so, you know, anyone might assume we don't exist anymore or we closed or whatnot and all of the shows and events and specials that we were just sort of planning to engage with our audience, we didn't have that line of communication.”</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="600" outstream="" momentum=""></partner-banner><p>Having no luck with Instagram's help support, he decided to file a small claim in the Dover District Court, thinking Facebook would “get the memo” and either give the account back or pay him a couple hundred bucks to repay him for lost revenue.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“</strong>What was interesting is after I filed that claim, Facebook's response to it was so enormous and sort of so disproportionate to what I was, at the time, ultimately claiming: in their eyes, a relatively small account, small business owner just seeking a quick fix,” Soldati said. “And they sort of threw the book at me and had this massive memo and motion to dismiss that had like 10 points of why Facebook doesn't owe me anything. That was the moment that I realized that I had sort of struck some kind of nerve.”</p><h2>How did Soldati beat Facebook?</h2><p>Despite Facebook hiring several law firms to defend their case, Soldati, representing himself, was able to successfully argue Meta/Facebook committed a breach of contract and that they were not immune under the Communications Decency Act.</p><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><p>Soldati argued that by deleting his account with no explanation or warning, Meta had broken its contract set in the terms of service, and therefore was a breach of contract. In response, Meta claimed Soldati had accidentally deleted the account himself. But Soldati had screenshots from the day his account was deleted.</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><p>“The defendant provided two conflicting reasons for the deletion and was unable to specify a clear reason for the deletion,” read the court’s final order. “This court finds that the plaintiff has met their burden showing that they did not delete their own account.”</p><p>The court ruled in favor of Soldati that Facebook had committed a breach of contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Meta also argued it was immune to any cases brought against them under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA), which is often used to obtain immunity from claims involving the publishing or deletion of material on its platforms.</p><p>When Soldati originally filed his claim in the Dover District Court in 2018, it was dismissed under this section. But when he appealed it to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, they decided that Facebook was actually<a href="https://www.fosters.com/story/news/2020/07/24/teatotaller-gets-nh-supreme-court-win-over-facebook-instagram-which-deleted-cafersquos-account/113763892/"> not immune from liability</a> under the CDA. This win send the case back to the Dover District Court to issue a ruling on the small claim.</p><p>This time, the Dover District Court found Meta didn’t keep its promise to Teatotaller and deleted the account “without sufficient basis, and inconsistent with the reasons they have provided in the&nbsp;<em>Terms of Use.”</em></p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><p>The order ends, “Accordingly, the defendant is not entitled to immunity under the CDA.”&nbsp;</p><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><p>Meta’s motion to dismiss also included some other arguments Soldati calls “bogus.” It argued Instagram and Facebook (now Meta) aren’t the same company, but Facebook bought Instagram in 2012, six years before Soldati’s account was deleted. It also argued Meta doesn’t do any business in New Hampshire, but it markets and advertises to New Hampshire users. The company also argued Facebook is a free service which nobody pays for, but Soldati and other professional account owners do pay. These arguments ultimately failed.</p><h2>So why did Facebook delete Teatotaller’s account?</h2><p>Meta never gave an explanation for why it deleted Teatotaller's account.</p><p>While Teatotaller is known for supporting LGBTQ rights and has had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fosters.com/story/news/2018/01/08/vandals-strike-somersworth-billboard/16354567007/">daring billboards promoting the business vandalized</a>, Soldati doesn’t think that was the reason for the deletion.</p><p>“It’s very possible that Facebook just screwed up,” Soldati said, but he thinks the company wouldn’t want to admit that.</p><p><strong>“</strong>If Facebook made a technological misstep that damaged the integrity of some of their users accounts, that's a credibility risk and it's a shareholder risk,” Soldati said. “And so I think a big aspect of this and why they shifted to trying to pretend that I deleted the account was because the true reason of its deletion could actually be something that undermines the promise that they claim to bring the users that, 'Hey, don't worry, as long as you follow the rules and don't post offensive material, whatever, you're good. And we're going to keep your account safe. We're going to keep your account active.'”</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><h2>What does this win mean for Soldati and other Facebook users?</h2><p>The District Court's ruling awarded Soldati $100 plus costs, and Soldati said the final amount is still pending. He said it will probably be just a few hundred dollars, maybe a few thousand dollars.</p><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><p>It’s nothing compared to the time he’s spent on the case, or what his business lost from the initial account deletion. To him, what’s more important is the repercussions of this decision.&nbsp;</p><p>The New Hampshire Supreme Court is now the highest court to have decided against Facebook’s CDA defense, according to Soldati.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“</strong>I can be happy about the hundreds of dollars I put in my pocket. But ultimately, this will sort of stand as an example of like, they can't continue to throw the book at people and say, 'No, you don't have a claim here because we're immune,'” said Soldati. “Because now people can point to the New Hampshire Supreme Court and a small claims court in Dover, New Hampshire, and say here a judge found that you didn't pass the test.”</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><p>Soldati said he hopes courts start to see Meta as a monopoly. He initially filed his claim because there wasn’t another place for him to market his small business.</p><p>“It’s not like I can sell bubble tea on Twitter the way I can market it on a reel or a story or a post,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>During the years-long course of the trial, he received lots of messages from people facing similar situations. A New York Times article reported many users had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/technology/instagram-accounts-suspended.html">their accounts deleted</a>&nbsp;in 2022. He hopes individual users can use this decision to gain power and leverage against the social media great.</p><p>“Atsome point some court has to review this and say, 'Maybe Facebook should not have as much power to completely dominate and control not only the social media landscape, but our court system,'” Soldati said.</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><partner-inline util-module-path="elements/partner" placement="native-article_link" sizes="[[300, 250], [3, 3]]" min-height="250" fluid="" outstream=""></partner-inline><p>In court, Soldati said Facebook attorneys were condescending and patronizing to him, but he took it seriously because it was his livelihood and because he thought that someone needed to fight them. He says it was “100%” worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>Gary Burt, a Manchester lawyer who represented Meta in the New Hampshire Supreme Court as well as the Dover District Court, did not immediately respond to a request to comment for this story.</p><lit-timestamp slot="timestamp" publishdate="2024-01-26 10:23:53 +0000 UTC" updatedate="2024-01-26 15:09:27 +0000 UTC"></lit-timestamp><p><a alt="Post the article to your Facebook Timeline" data-size="large" onclick="fireNavShareAnalytics('facebook');" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><svg view-box="0 0 24 24">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Plastic pollution is a menace worldwide. Plastics are now <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg5433">found</a> in every <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.1c04158">environment</a> on the planet, from the deepest seas to the atmosphere and human bodies. </p>

<p>Scientific evidence <a href="https://doi.org/10.5334/aogh.4056">describing harm</a> to the environment and humans is growing. Hence, the United Nations has <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/39812/OEWG_PP_1_INF_1_UNEA%20resolution.pdf">resolved</a> to <a href="https://enb.iisd.org/negotiations/international-legally-binding-instrument-plastics-pollution-including-marine#:%7E:text=The%20United%20Nations%20Environment%20Assembly,pollution%2C%20including%20in%20the%20marine">negotiate</a> a legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution.  </p>

<p>Strategies to achieve this goal include provisions throughout the plastics lifespan: production, use, waste management and remediation. </p>

<p>In designing rules for managing plastic, it’s important to understand that plastic materials and waste streams are complex. Not all plastics are the same. And recycled plastics are not necessarily “better” – less harmful – than virgin plastics. If they contained harmful chemicals to begin with, recycling doesn’t make them less harmful. And sometimes they are contaminated by other substances.</p>

<p>We conducted a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340923008090?via%3Dihub">study</a> identifying and measuring the concentration of contaminants in recycled pellets from 28 small-scale recycling facilities in the global south. Plastic waste is often exported from high income countries to less developed countries, with few to no requirements for reporting their makeup.</p>

<p>Our investigation covered facilities in Cameroon, Mauritius, Nigeria, Tanzania and Togo in Africa as well others in Asia, Europe and South America. </p>

<p>We found 191 pesticides, 107 pharmaceuticals and 81 industrial compounds among many others in the recycled plastic pellets. Many of these chemicals could be hazardous and make the plastics unsuitable for reuse.</p>

<p>This finding can inform regulations for recycled plastics. The chemical composition of the plastic should be checked before it is recycled. </p>

<h2>Chemicals used in production of plastics</h2>

<p>More than <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/chemicals-plastics-technical-report">13,000 chemicals</a> are currently used in the production of plastic materials and products. They can include thousands of plastics additives – but also substances that are added unintentionally. Some unwanted chemicals form during the production or life of plastics. Thousands of these chemicals have dangerous properties. The health risks of some others are unknown. </p>

<p>Throughout the plastics value chain, during production, use, waste and recycling, other chemicals can contaminate the material too. The result may be recycled materials whose chemical composition is unknown. </p>

<p>Previous studies have reported the presence of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.10.014">plastics additives</a> in recycled materials. Among them were chemicals that are <a href="https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/chemicals-waste/what-we-do/emerging-issues/endocrine-disrupting-chemicals">known</a> to have <a href="https://www.epa.gov/endocrine-disruption/overview-endocrine-disruption">negative effects on health</a>. Examples include <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055387">phthalates</a> (plastic softeners), bisphenols like <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303720706002292">BPA</a>, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721044478?via%3Dihub">UV-stabilisers</a> used to protect plastics from sun damage and yellowing.</p>

<p>In our work, we established the presence of chemicals in recycled plastic that can cause harm to humans or other organisms. They include pesticides, pharmaceuticals and fragrances. Others are chemicals that result from burning natural materials, man-made organic chemicals used for industrial applications like paint, and ultraviolet filters.</p>

<p>We quantified a total of 491 different chemical substances. Some had specific uses and others formed from the breakdown of products.</p>

<p>Some national and regional policies <a href="https://www.basel.int/Implementation/Plasticwaste/Globalgovernance/tabid/8335/Default.aspx">regulate</a> the allowable concentration of hazardous chemicals in specific plastic products. But only 1% of plastics chemicals are subject to international regulation in existing multilateral environmental agreements. Policies don’t adequately address the issue of transparent reporting of chemicals in plastics across their value chain. Also, there are no laws to govern monitoring of chemicals in recycled materials. This is a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk9846">serious gap</a> in oversight. Stronger and more globally coordinated measures are necessary. </p>

<p>Our findings emphasise the importance of regulating mechanical recycling, as many of the substances measured were contaminants and not plastic additives. Many of the chemicals we identified may have contaminated the materials during use. For example, a jug used for storing pesticides will absorb some of the pesticides and will contaminate the recycling waste stream. Plastics in the environment are also known to absorb <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X11005960">organic pollutants</a>. </p>

<p>To assess the quality of recycled plastics, it’s crucial to know which chemicals are present and in what concentrations. This information can guide regulations about how recycled plastics may be used. It will also be valuable for plastics producers, waste management workers (including recyclers), consumers, and the scientific community.</p>

<h2>A path towards safer reuse of plastics</h2>

<p>To recycle more materials safely, several changes are necessary. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>increased transparency regarding the use of chemicals and their risks </p></li>
<li><p>chemical simplification of the plastics market, so that fewer and less toxic chemicals are permitted for use</p></li>
<li><p>improved waste management infrastructure with separated waste streams  </p></li>
<li><p>improved recycling methods, including monitoring of hazardous chemicals.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Chemical simplification of plastic additives will promote sustainability, safety and regulatory compliance. It will help manufacturers to minimise the environmental impact and adverse health effects of complex chemical formulations. Simpler chemical structures also improve the recycling potential of plastics and make recycling more efficient and cost-effective.</p>

<p><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.1c04903">Chemical simplification</a> can also reduce potential health risks in the disposal of plastic materials. </p>

<p>From a regulatory perspective, chemical simplification supports clearer and more enforceable safety guidelines.</p>

<p>It’s is a crucial step towards the sustainable production and use of plastics, as  countries work towards a legal instrument to end pollution.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple’s new rules in the European Union mean browsers like Firefox can finally use their own engines on iOS. Although this may seem like a welcome change, Mozilla spokesperson&nbsp;Damiano DeMonte tells <em>The Verge</em> it’s “extremely disappointed” with the way things turned out.</p><p>“We are still reviewing the technical details but are extremely disappointed with Apple’s proposed plan to restrict the newly-announced BrowserEngineKit to EU-specific apps,” DeMonte says. “The effect of this would be to force an independent browser like Firefox to build and maintain two separate browser implementations — a burden Apple themselves will not have to bear.”</p><p>In iOS 17.4, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050478/apple-ios-17-4-browser-engines-eu">Apple will no longer force browsers</a> in the EU to use WebKit, the underlying engine that powers Safari. The change opens the door for other popular engines, such as Blink, which is used by Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, as well as Gecko, the engine used by Firefox. It also means third-party browsers could become fully functional on iOS without any of the limitations that come along with WebKit. </p><p>Despite this, Mozilla argues that rolling out the changes only in the EU will make it more difficult for browsers to juggle different versions. “Apple’s proposals fail to give consumers viable choices by making it as painful as possible for others to provide competitive alternatives to Safari,” DeMonte adds. “This is another example of Apple creating barriers to prevent true browser competition on iOS.”</p><p>Mozilla isn’t the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051818/apple-app-store-dma-eu-developer-response">only developer critical of Apple’s new rules</a>, which also extend to game streaming apps, alternative app stores, and sideloading. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney called the new terms a “horror show,” while <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-01-26/apples-proposed-changes-reject-the-goals-of-the-dma/">Spotify said the changes</a> are a “farce.” Apple’s guidelines are still pending approval by the EU Commission.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/third-party-iphone-app-stores-ios-17-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple announced</a> some major changes to the App Store and the broader iPhone platform in the European Union, including support for alternative app marketplaces. There’s one piece of nuance that Apple is now clarifying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of these changes are coming to all of Apple’s platforms, while others are coming <em>only</em> to the iPhone and not the iPad.</p>



<p>There is reason for this nuance. Apple explains that the European Union ruled that iOS is a gatekeeper platform as part of the Digital Markets Act. This applies only to iOS on the iPhone. iPadOS on the iPad is a completely different platform in the eyes of Apple and the European Commission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the Digital Markets Act designates the entirety of the App Store as a gatekeeper service. In the eyes of the European Commission, this includes the App Store across all of Apple’s platforms: iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV.</p>




	<p>With that in mind, Apple has bifurcated these changes based on the requirements of the DMA. Changes coming to the App Store are coming to all of Apple’s platforms, while changes to the iPhone are coming <em>only</em> to the iPhone, even if iOS shares a lot of the same codebase as iPadOS.</p>



<p>Here’s what that means in practice.</p>



<ul>
<li>The ability to install third-party app marketplaces and download apps from third-party app marketplaces will be an option <em>only</em> on the iPhone.</li>



<li>The new <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/26/apple-shares-more-details-about-the-new-default-web-browser-prompt-in-ios-17-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prompt in Safari</a> that asks users to pick a default browser engine is coming <em>only</em> to the iPhone.</li>



<li>Support for third-<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/third-party-default-browsers-engines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">party browser engines</a> is coming <em>only</em> to the iPhone.</li>



<li>The ability to set default NFC and wallet apps will <em>only</em> be available on the iPhone.</li>



<li>Changes to App Store policy to allow <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/apple-announces-reduced-commission-structure-for-apps-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alternative payments and lower commissions</a> affect the App Store across all Apple platforms.</li>



<li>Changes to the App Store guidelines to allow <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/apple-game-streaming-app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game streaming apps</a> impact all of Apple’s platforms.</li>
</ul>



<p>All of these changes are coming as part of iOS 17.4, which is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-beta-1-new-features/">currently available in developer beta testing</a>.</p>

Although the intermediary version, TPU v5e, released earlier this year, offers the most value for money of all three, it's only up to 1.9-times faster than TPU v4, making TPU v5p the most powerful.</p><p>It's even powerful enough to rival Nvidia's widely in-demand H100 GPU, which is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/best-graphics-cards-1291458" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/best-graphics-cards-1291458"><u>best graphics cards</u></a> out there for AI workloads.

<p>Microsoft is investigating an ongoing and widespread outage impacting the users of its Teams communication platform and causing connectivity issues, login problems, and message delays.</p>
<p>While Redmond is still working on addressing these ongoing problems, it revealed that a networking issue might be the root cause of this outage.</p>
<p>"We've identified a networking issue impacting a portion of the Teams service and we're performing a failover to remediate impact. Additional information can be found under TM710344 in the admin center," <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1750931051210228178" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a> the official Microsoft account for updates on Microsoft 365 service incidents.</p>
<p>Affected customers have reported login and server connection issues, desktop and mobile Teams apps freezing on the loading screen, and message delivery problems.</p>
<p>Other reports mention chat history not being available and images no longer displaying in chat, as well as being left in the waiting room after joining Teams meetings.</p>

<p>The outage affects users performing a cold boot, who may not be able to log into teams and will see an "oops" page. It also causes users attempting to log into their accounts and unlocking devices to see missing messages.</p>
<p>Other scenarios experienced by impacted customers can lead to:</p>
<ul><li>Users may fail to load messages in channels and chats</li>
<li>Users are unable to view or download their media (images, videos, audio, call recordings, code snippets)</li>
<li>Some messages may experience delays being sent</li>
<li>Call Recordings might take longer to appear in user's OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online</li>
<li>Bots may be unable to download attachments</li>
<li>Sending and receiving read receipt notifications may be delayed</li>
</ul><p>"Our review of service telemetry indicates a portion of database infrastructure that facilitates multiple APls is experiencing a networking issue, resulting in impact," Microsoft said.</p>
<p>"We're continuing our investigation to isolate the underlying cause of the networking issue and develop remediation actions."</p>
<p><em>Update&nbsp;January 26, 12:55 EST: </em>Added&nbsp;TM710344 incident report&nbsp;info.</p>
<p><em>Update&nbsp;January 26, 13:28 EST:</em> Microsoft says it's working on addressing the server issues and is seeing signs of improvement.</p>
<p>"We've completed the failover in the EMEA region and service telemetry is showing some improvement. The failovers for the North and South America regions are ongoing and we continue to monitor," the company <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1750947382588571976" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a>.</p>
<p><em>Update&nbsp;January 26, 14:21 EST: </em>Added details on more affected scenarios shared by Microsoft on the <a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">service health portal</a>.</p>

The news came after scientific-image sleuth Sholto David <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/01/02/dana-farberications-at-harvard-university/" data-track="click" data-label="https://forbetterscience.com/2024/01/02/dana-farberications-at-harvard-university/" data-track-category="body text link">posted his concerns</a> about more than 50 manuscripts to a blog on 2 January.</p><p>In the papers, published in a range of journals including <i>Blood</i>, <i>Cell</i> and <i>Nature Immunology</i>, David found images from western blots — a common test for detecting proteins in biological samples — in which bands seemed to be spliced, stretched and copied and pasted. He also found images of mice duplicated across figures where they shouldn’t have been. (<i>Nature</i>’s news team is editorially independent of its publisher, Springer Nature, and of other Nature-branded journals.)</p><figure>

</figure><p>It was not the first time that some of these irregularities had been noted; some were flagged years ago on PubPeer, a website where researchers comment on and critique scientific papers. The student newspaper <i>The Harvard Crimson</i> <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/1/12/dana-farber-research-misconduct-allegations/" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/1/12/dana-farber-research-misconduct-allegations/" data-track-category="body text link">reported on David’s findings</a> on 12 January.</p><p>The DFCI, an affiliate of Harvard University, had already been investigating some of the papers in question before David’s blogpost was published, says the centre’s research-integrity officer, Barrett Rollins. “Correcting the scientific record is a common practice of institutions with strong research-integrity processes,” he adds. (Rollins is a co-author of three of the papers that David flagged and is not involved in investigations into them, says DFCI spokesperson Ellen Berlin.) The DFCI is declining requests for interviews with its researchers about the retractions.</p><p>David, based in Pontypridd, UK, spoke to <i>Nature</i> about how he uncovered the data irregularities at the DFCI and what scientists can do to prevent mix-ups in their own work.</p><h2>You’ve said that you’re doing data sleuthing full-time. How did you get into it?</h2><p>I’m not doing anything else. I did my PhD in cellular molecular biology at Newcastle University [UK], and I finished that in 2019. And then I went to work for Oxford Biomedica [a UK gene- and cell-therapy company]. I was there for three years and then I moved out here to Wales. Since then, I’ve been doing this image stuff. I’m not doing this nine to five, but I am pretty busy with it.</p><p>I used to write letters to the editor [at journals], but it’s a very infuriating process. So, it’s through getting frustrated that I discovered PubPeer.</p><h2>You recently left your 2,000th comment on PubPeer. What keeps you coming back?</h2><p>I enjoy the ridiculous back and forth with the authors over e-mail. I care a lot about the animals [that are killed for life-sciences experiments] as well. The level of expectation we should have when we’re dealing with animals and high-profile institutions is that they’re super careful and that they get things right, so it’s frustrating when you see errors.</p><h2>What’s your usual process when you’re combing through a paper?</h2><p>It’s going to depend on the problem that I might expect to find. A few months ago, [the open-access journal] <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2023/11/17/schneider-shorts-17-11-2023-this-brilliant-scientist-has-been-punished-enough/#plos" data-track="click" data-label="https://forbetterscience.com/2023/11/17/schneider-shorts-17-11-2023-this-brilliant-scientist-has-been-punished-enough/#plos" data-track-category="body text link"><i>PLoS One</i> retracted nine papers</a>, and these were all to do with gastric-damage stuff. In that case, I was looking for image reuse between papers. I went and I got all of this guy’s papers, and I cropped all of the images out of all the papers, put it in a giant folder and then resized them all. And I used a script to feed it into Imagetwin [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02920-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02920-y" data-track-category="body text link">software that compares images</a> with a database of more than 25 million others]. But for the DFCI stuff, a lot of what I found and what had been previously posted [on PubPeer] is duplicated images within the same paper. Imagetwin is really useful for these things.</p><p>I note and collect the errors on PubPeer, write a blog, send the blog to the publisher and university. What I’m hoping for is that the authors respond on PubPeer. If I see a really credible, active response on PubPeer, then I’d probably just leave it there.</p><h2>Thinking about the DFCI papers, what pattern of potential image manipulation stood out to you the most?</h2><p>There is one where there’s images of mice, and it looks like one of them has been copied lots of times, and there’s a bioluminescent signal that’s been superimposed on top. It’s got the ears in the same place. It’s almost certainly the same mouse in about five different pictures in different groups and different time points. In [another paper], you’ve got a western-blot figure, and the same band has appeared multiple times across the whole lot. Not just one splice or one clumsy copy and paste; it’s the same band that has been superimposed into that block quite carefully.</p><figure>

</figure><h2>What did you think of the DFCI’s acknowledgement that it would seek retractions for 6 papers and corrections for 31 others?</h2><p>I’ve flagged about 58 papers. In 16 or 17 of those, they say the data was collected at other institutions. Three of them, they dispute. I accept that. But I’d like to know what the dispute is. [The DFCI did not respond to explain why it disagrees with the anomalies flagged by David. It also said that one further paper is still under examination.]</p><p>So that seems like it’s pretty much all of them accounted for. In one sense, I’m relieved. They basically accepted that these are all errors. I stand by what’s on the blog and by what I post on PubPeer.</p><p>It does leave a frustrated feeling because a lot of these comments have been on PubPeer for ages. But now, suddenly, after the blogpost, Rollins has said, ‘we’ve known about some of these concerns’. Why does it take some nobody like me dropping a blog to make them start doing this? [Berlin didn’t immediately respond to questions on when the DFCI’s investigation began or how many papers the institute was investigating before David published his blogpost.]</p><h2>Do you think journals are doing enough to correct the scientific record when these cases come up?</h2><p>The response is usually slow, if they respond at all. It’s a very painful process to try to report an accusation of image duplication. It’d be nice if there was an obvious way just to click a button and flag a paper. It would be nice if you could leave a comment on the journal’s page, because how many people read PubPeer?</p><h2>How can scientists avoid accusations of data impropriety?</h2><p>There’s a pretty simple way to preventing all of this: you should design some file-organizing system that involves giving research images a sensible name. And then when it comes to checking your paper before you publish it, you need to trace back all the images to the raw data and check them against the metadata. For example, if you have a photo labelled as ‘Day three’, does that correspond to the date the photo was taken or that the experiment happened on?</p><h2>Do you have any recommendations for scientists whose work is questioned?</h2><p>I don’t want to make an environment where people feel harassed. The main thing I’d like to see is a polite response, and to acknowledge whether the error is there or not. Because it’s very frustrating if you say, ‘We’ll look into this,’ without acknowledging the errors on the page or giving a timeline.</p>

<h2>PinePhone - Post daily driver review</h2>
<p>Review of PinePhone after a month of daily driving.</p>

<p>All opinions are my own, and most of the review is for my own use-cases. There are some comparisons, mostly for entertainment purposes, to iOS (based on my previous device, iPhone 12 Pro) and Android (based on my current device, de-googled OnePlus Nord N10 5G). </p>
<br>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>PinePhone is a great mobile Linux device. I would use it as my daily driver, and probably iron out some issues I ran into, but for me, it failed at... being a phone. I had repeated, unpredictable problems both placing and receiving calls, and I could not resolve them. See below for details.</p>
<br>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>3GB RAM Convergence edition original PinePhone rev 1.2B.</p>

<br>
<h3>Body</h3>
<p>TLDR: Plastic, pretty standard for mid level phone.</p>
<p>Well-made, pretty standard dimensions, is a bit slippery, but buttons have a good feel to them. It would be great with a grippy case.</p>
<p>Having all three buttons on the right side makes it convenient for environments like SXMO, which uses buttons for navigating menus.</p>
<br>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>TLDR: Okay, difficult to see in bright light.</p>
<p>After ultra-smooth modern phone touchscreens, PinePhone's screen protector feels strange, but is nothing unusual. (You can take it off or replace it with a glass one for more glossy feel)</p>
<p>The display itself is an IPS panel. Not as colorful as OLED, but not as expensive or power-hungry, either. My only complaint is that it's difficult to see in bright light, so I kept the light theme for everything.</p>
<br>
<h3>Battery</h3>
<p>TLDR: Eh. Enough for occasional texting and short calls. Plug in otherwise.</p>
<p>Not great, but not terrible. At first, and when traveling, I carried a power bank with me, but rarely needed it. If you use the phone to occasionally text and chat, you are OK. Browser and WiFi are the two things that noticeably drain the battery. Often, if not actively using bandwidth, I think it makes sense to turn WiFi off.</p>
<p>I made an adapter to use with Samsung S20 Ultra battery case, but some strange USB issues kill the modem while case is active, so I could not try it out very well.</p>

<br>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>postmarketOS stable with Phosh (installed on new 128GB SD card)</p>

<br>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>TLDR: EASY.</p>
<p>To install an OS, you flash an image to an SD card, put it in the PinePhone and turn it on. That's it. You can swap OSes by changing SD cards as much as you want.</p>
<p>Compare to Android, which involves unlocking the bootloader, flashing recovery, booting into recovery, flashing an OS image, and possibly patching the image to get root.</p>
<p>Compare to iOS which doesn't let you do that to any reasonable extent.</p>
<p>(Yes, I know normal people do not install OS on their phones...)</p>
<br>
<h3>Activation</h3>
<p>TLDR: No hand-holding, but only few settings.</p>
<p>When you start some distros/desktops, you are presented with a short tutorial. You need to configure the mobile connection yourself, but it's usually just setting the APN and MMSC URLs. For postmarketOS+Phosh, the APN setting is in Settings/Mobile Networks, and MMSC setting is in Chats/Settings.</p>

<p>Compare to Android, which requires clicking through multiple pages of setup. Although most of that is skippable (depending on the manufacturer too, I guess).</p>
<p>Compare to iOS, which not only annoys you to set up Siri and Face ID on setup and at every update, but does not allow you to activate the phone without an SMS message. (Very convenient when in another country with no coverage or high roaming charges)</p>
<br>
<h3>UI</h3>
<p>TLDR: Phosh is conventional and practical. SXMO is a bit unusual but pretty cool and very customizable.</p>
<p>Phosh navigation uses the bar on the bottom of the screen (similar enough to iOS and Android), which opens both a list of running applications and an app drawer. All apps in the drawer are listed alphabetically but can be added to the favorites list on top. </p>
<p><img src="https://yaky.dev/2024-01-25-pinephone-post-daily-driver-review/phosh.jpg" alt="Phosh app drawer"></p>
<p>I think this unification of home screen with the app drawer is simpler and faster than Android/iOS pinned apps + pages, and much more organized than iOS's "home screen is an app dumpster" (which i see on many people's phones).</p>
<p>There are occasional slowdowns but they are not significant.</p>
<p>Some unimplemented controls, such as switch for location and inhibit-suspend (aka caffeine), I wrote as desktop entries ("shortcuts" that show up in app drawer).</p>
<p>Most GTK-based apps are more or less consistent in their styling, and you can force a theme on everything if you want to. Qt is a bit all over the place.</p>
<p>Phosh does not have a global "back" button, so each application has to implement its own UI. Usually, the back button is in the upper left, which is very inconvenient. Although, new Android and iOS now use the "swipe from left edge" to go back, which is equally unwieldy for people with regular-length thumbs. Android with its back button on the bottom bar is still the best in this regard.</p>
<p>Another desktop environment is SXMO. It has a menu-based UI that you navigate using the volume and power buttons, as well as some pre-defined gestures for other actions. It is intended to be used with simple terminal-based tools, but I had no problems running any other software. I liked being able to open applications side-by-side, override and customize any menu (you can even make app-specific menus for most-used actions, for example), and run hooks on events (such as custom notifications for texts, calls, etc).</p>

<br>
<h3>Keyboard</h3>
<p>TLDR: Simple, but customizable</p>
<p>Phosh uses squeekboard, which is a pretty standard, simple keyboard which supports multiple languages and can be very easily customized by editing a YAML file. There's no swipe, spell-check, or predictive text, but there are other projects that try to implement that.</p>
<p>SXMO uses wvkbd, which is aimed more towards terminal use and includes cursor keys, modifiers (Ctrl, Alt), and other useful keys (/, -, Tab). To customize wvkbd, you... compile it from source. It's pretty straightforward C and builds in a few seconds.</p>
<br>
<h3>Notifications</h3>
<p>TLDR: Only calls and SMS notifications are truly real-time.</p>
<p>If PinePhone is in sleep (by default, after 2 minutes of idle on Phosh), it cannot receive notifications. The modem (which, itself, is another Linux device) is always on, so once it receives a call or SMS, it will wake PinePhone up. Theoretically, it should be possible to have modem check for notifications, but I am not aware of any project that did this yet. </p>
<p>The way notifications present themselves is per-application, more or less. On Phosh, Calls vibrate continuously for calls, Chats vibrates and chimes. Fractal (Matrix messenger), and Dino (XMPP messenger), however, produce notifications silently. But you have access to their source code, so that can be changed - I rebuilt Dino with noisy notifications before.</p>
<p>There are no icons on the status bar, but most notifications show in the pull-down panel and make the LED blink blue. Yes, I love blinkenlights. However, blinking the LED is kind of silly, because if the phone goes to sleep, it will keep the LED state it last had (either permanently on or off).</p>
<p>Compare with Android, which mostly got rid of the notification light :( But notifications are shown in the status bar and can wake the screen.</p>
<p>Compare with iOS, whose UI is terrible in this regard. Notifications wake the screen, and show on lockscreen, but only until you unlock the phone. Then they are dropped somewhere into "notification center", which required an additional swipe to open. And unless you start a habit of checking that separate screen, you can miss them for a long time. The status bar is taken up by the notch, so there is no space for icons there. </p>
<br>
<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>TLDR: Probably fine for 2G and 3G calls, but VoLTE is flaky and unpredictable.</p>
<p>Your experience may vary wildly. According to forums, github, and reddit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some people report no issues placing and receiving calls with PinePhone as-is.</li>
<li>Some even use it exclusively as a phone, no other software.</li>
<li>Some install and use the FOSS modem firmware, and it resolves their issues.</li>
<li>Some people report that FOSS modem firmware causes more issues, and recommend reverting to stock 01.003 or 01.002 version for stability.</li>
</ul>

<p>For me, calls were extremely unreliable. Just for the information, I have T-Mobile as my provider (which is one of the few that allow PinePhone in the US), but I live in a hilly neighborhood of a small city where my signal strength shows 50% at best for 4G, and 25% for 2G. 3G has been disabled and 2G significantly scaled down by all US carriers AFAIK. Because of that, I have to rely on VoLTE for calls. Which, I believe, is the main cause of my problems. As far as I know, PinePhone's modem, Quectel EG25-G, is intended for IoT devices, and technically supports VoLTE, but not officially.</p>

<p>These are the issues I had:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modem crashes for no apparent reason. Takes about 30 seconds to restart. Somewhat better with FOSS firmware though.</li>
<li>Phone shows 4G connectivity, but modem will reboot or stop responding when trying to call or use data. Seems to happen after long periods of sleep.</li>
<li>Unable to place a call. Phone either drops the call immediately, or waits about 30 seconds and then drops it. Presumably, the delay is an attempt to place a call over 2G, which, due to poor signal, does not happen. Sometimes, keeping the phone awake for a few minutes seems to reconnect it to VoLTE, and allows me to call. Sometimes not, and once, I have been unable to call for up to 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Unable to receive a call. Callers say their call goes straight to voicemail, or rings once and then is sent to voicemail. I get absolutely no indication of missed calls. Usually happens after the phone has been in sleep for some length of time. One way to improve the chances of receving a call is to keep the phone plugged in and awake. My suspicion is that a sleeping modem cannot accept VoLTE calls, and if a call cannot come in through 2G, it is dropped.</li>
<li>Rarely, call drops in the middle of the call, then either one of the above issues happens. Usually, once call is connected, it is fine.</li>
<li>Phone gets uncomfortably hot at the top, where the earpiece (and, i suppose, the antenna) is.</li>
</ul>

<p>I tried several firmwares, and they all had their benefits and drawbacks, but the VoLTE problems above persisted for all of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biktorgj's FOSS firmware 0.7.4, ADSP 01.003 and others. Lots of cool features (tracking, alarm-via-modem), lower power consumption, automatic checking for stuck SMS messages, modem seems to crash less. However, did not seem to connect to 2G properly, no voice / echo correction (I sound super quiet on the call, and cannot use speakerphone), and no automatic GPS switch (have to run a sudo script to enable it). All incoming calls went to voicemail.</li>
<li>Stock firmware 30.006, latest. Had voice / echo correction and automatic GPS, but incoming calls still go to voicemail. Crashes more than FOSS though.</li>
<li>Stock firmware 01.002, sort-of-original, and recommended for stability. Has voice / echo correction, automatic GPS, and correctly downgrades to 2G when placing calls. Some incoming calls came through.</li>
</ul>


<p>Some people on the forum recommended modifying udev rules to keep the power to permanently on for stock firmware (it is set to "auto" by default), but that did not seem to help, just increased the battery drain.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, I tried Mobian OS, which uses a different kernel with some modem-related improvements. One noticeable change is a very strong mic boost that sounds like rumbling or cat purr to the other part. I suppose this is to address the "too quiet" issue for FOSS firmware? At that point, I did not want to try re-installing firmware again.</p>
<p>On that note, UBPorts does not support VoLTE on ANY of their devices.</p>

<p>To eliminate another potential cause, I got a new SIM card. I didn't think it would matter, but my friend suggested to do it anyway, as he had to get a new SIM card to get 3G working on his phone (many years ago). That didn't help.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, while I was writing this, calling using my current (officially supported by T-Mobile) Android phone, I got a very similar scenario: about 30 seconds of attempting to call, phone frantically switching between VoLTE and VoWiFi, then dropping the call. The second attempt went through 2G and connected. Maybe I should not blame PinePhone's modem here...</p>
<br>
<h3>Voicemail</h3>
<p>TLDR: You get cryptic texts.</p>
<p>When you get a voicemail, you get a data text message from a short number, so you will know you got one. There is VVMD (visual voicemail daemon), but I did not try setting it up.</p>
<br>
<h3>Texting</h3>
<p>TLDR: Works well.</p>
<p>Basic text messaging through SMS and media through MMS work well and without issues. </p>
<p>The default (and only?) text messenger, Chats, does not natively play some formats (for example, 3gp video), but they will open as long as you have the appropriate application.</p>
<p>I really have no complaints here because I remember when getting MMS and unblocking the SMS queue on the modem were manual operations.</p>
<p>On PinePhone, text messages will wake up the phone, so they are almost realtime, as one would expect.</p>
<br>
<h3>Messaging</h3>
<p>TLDR: Works well, no notifications in sleep.</p>
<p>Although Chats lets you use Matrix accounts and even supports encryption messaging, there are several usability issues, resulting in disconnections, missed messages, and crashes. </p>
<p>For Matrix, Fractal (via flatpak) works very well, although has some minor UI issues. Nheko works well, seems a bit faster, and has swipe controls (if that's your thing).</p>
<p>For XMPP, I have used Dino in the past, and it is also a very well-made messenger, with audio and video call functionality (which I have not tried).</p>
<p>I do not have any contacts on Signal, so I have not tried any Signal clients or bridges.</p>
<p>For WhatsApp, I run a Matrix bridge, so 99% of messages are routed through my Matrix client. For once-in-a-while calls, I use an old device I keep at home.</p>
<br>
<h3>Camera</h3>
<p>TLDR: Potato, no video out of the box.</p>
<p>Camera works okay. Raw camera data has to be post-processed to balance colors, so it takes several seconds for a photo to appear in a directory. Sometimes, post-processing fails and you get a black rectangle. Editing some shell-scripts, I removed the heavy part of post-processing (sharpening) and reduced the processing time to around a second.</p>
<p>The quality is poor by any standard since 2010: the pictures are grainy and have low dynamic range. At the same time, they look like old film photos, and there's a certain charm to it.</p>
<p><img src="https://yaky.dev/2024-01-25-pinephone-post-daily-driver-review/pinephone-photo.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Do not let the phone go to sleep with the camera app open, or it might enter a state where it cannot wake up and needs to be rebooted.</p>
<p>There are no apps to shoot video, but it's possible via scripts (I have not tried).</p>
<p>While having a bad camera can be frustrating, think about all the pictures you took and never looked at again.</p>
<br>
<h3>Navigation</h3>
<p>TLDR: Works. Not Google Maps though, learn your local roads.</p>
<p>Osmin is a good navigation app with live directions, voice, and offline maps.</p>
<p>GNOME Maps 45 and later has decent mobile UI, but does not have offline capabilities AFAIK.</p>
<p>As is with many apps based on OpenStreetMap data, do not expect that you'll be able to find an address (at least in the US) in Osmin, so use POIs or intersections instead. I think the only app that supports address lookup is Pure Maps, but it was fairly slow for me.</p>
<p>PinePhone's GNSS/GPS module works through the modem. Which sort of makes sense, but then, you can't use GPS without a SIM card installed... When GPS is enabled, it takes 10-15 minutes to get a precise location. Before that, your location is derived from Mozilla Location Service, map of known WiFi spots and their approximate locations, so it can be VERY rough (precision of a few streets away for me). GPS module does support AGPS (assisted GPS, locations of satellites downloaded over the internet) for faster location detection, but AFAIK none of the OSes implement that. (In fact, the modem has the config for it, and should be able to download it itself).</p>
<p>Interestingly, on my degoogled Android, I get a similar experience - very rough location until ~10 minutes later. Makes you consider how much Google knows everyone's router's location.</p>
<br>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>TLDR: Spotify playback is spotty.</p>
<p>I listen to mostly Spotify, and there is a mobile Linux client called Spot (both postmarketOS/Alpine repos and Flatpak). The main issue with it is that the playback stops after 2-4 songs. Not sure if that is an application issue, or the classic "sound on Linux" issue.</p>
<p>Of course, there's an official Spotify client, but it is available only for desktop Linux (x86_64).</p>
<p>There is spotify-qt, which did not work for me, and spotify-tui for the terminal(!), which I did not try.</p>
<br>
<h3>Browser</h3>
<p>TLDR: Stick with Firefox ESR.</p>
<p>Firefox ESR is the default on many Linux distributions. It is a desktop browser, adapted for mobile. Although it takes a while to load, the browsing is fast. There are some UI issues, and it can feel clumsy to use sometimes, but you should be able to do everything a desktop browser can. And it includes uBlock Origin add-on by default!</p>
<p>GNOME Web has great UI, some adblocking, and Firefox account integration (!), but the renderer itself (based on WebKit) is just too slow.</p>
<p>Angelfish has a nice UI and seems relatively fast, but I haven't used it much to have an opinion.</p>
<p>Another interesting option is BadWolf, WebKit-based browser with toggles for JS and images. Great idea, but I couldn't use it because it cannot focus on a textbox on the page (e.g. search box)</p>
<p>And for the terminal, there is the good old Lynx and w3m.</p>
<p>For gemini, Geopard looks and works really well.</p>
<br>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>TLDR: Several options.</p>
<p>I used gedit instead of the newer Text Editor to keep notes, as I found the UI better (fewer steps to do things). There are several note-taking apps, but they are too slow and have too many features that I don't need.</p>
<br>
<h3>Android applications</h3>
<p>TLDR: Possible.</p>
<p>To run Android applications, postmarketOS supports waydroid, which was surprisingly easy and straightforward to install. Launching LineageOS takes about a minute, and running apps drains the battery much quicker, but I was able to install and use a few things from F-Droid and Aurora Store. Expect apps to complain about Google Play Services.</p>
<br>
<h3>Connecting to PC</h3>
<p>TLDR: UNLIMITED POWER!</p>
<p>The "killer feature" of PinePhone is that you can SSH into it as any other Linux machine. If you run SXMO, you can easily navigate the same menus and text/message through the terminal.</p>
<p>I wrote a small rsync script to backup/sync notes and pictures onto my laptop. It does not require Syncthing (saves PinePhone's limited resources) or any complicated setup.</p>
<p>On Android, I sync my notes and pictures using Syncthing, which requires some setup, but is very convenient too.</p>
<p>On iOS, photos are not considered files (WTF Apple?!), so they cannot be synced with Mobius (Syncthing-like app). So the only way to back them up is via USB (which requires additional setup on Linux). </p>
<br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>My daily adventures with PinePhone have reached their end. PinePhone is refreshingly straightforward, and practical for many of my daily tasks. Alas, it was not much of a phone. Perhaps PinePDA would be a more fitting name.</p>
