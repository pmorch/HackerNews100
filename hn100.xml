  <span><time datetime="2013-05-29">29 May 2013</time></span>
  <p>Since I haven't published anything in almost two months, let me jot down one thought that has come to mind frequently over the past few months.</p>
<h2>If you use LaTeX …</h2>
<p>Well, first of all, are you sure you <em>have to</em> use LaTeX? By which I mean, are you sure you can't use Markdown+MathJax or textile+MathJax or restructuredText+MathJax? Especially if you're teaching your students, are you absolutely sure you are completely and utterly unable to use something simpler? Something that is more modern than learning a hundred bits of print typesetting that your student will never, ever need? Ok, just checking. So…</p>
<h2>If you (have to) use LaTeX, then make HTML your primary output.</h2>
<p>By which I mean: don't just produce PDFs that nobody can read on small screens, PDFs that nobody can read accessibly, PDFs that nobody will want to read in 5 years.</p>
<p>Make HTML your first output. It's important. HTML is the future engine for mathematical and scientific content. If you can't produce HTML, then ur doin it rong. If you don't produce HTML, you won't ever help all the people working on pushing math on the web forward.</p>
<p>It won't be trivial but easier than you think. Install <a href="http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/a">LaTeXML</a> and learn how to use it. (Alternatively you probably have a copy of tex4ht installed with your TeX.) How hard is it? This hard:</p>
<pre><code>  latexml --dest=mydoc.xml mydoc.tex
  latexmlpost --dest=mydoc.html --format=html5 mydoc.xml
</code></pre>
<p>And when you run into LaTeXML limitations, then get over it, <a href="http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/contact.html">report them back</a>, help make it better. If you run into problems with MathJax, <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/mathjax/issues">report them</a>, help make it better. You need graphics? Check out <a href="https://github.com/sonoisa/XyJax">xyjax</a>. You need pstricks? Check out <a href="http://mathapedia.com/">mathapedia</a>. You need computations? Check out <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/eval.html">Sage cell server</a>. It's all there, but you have to get started. To it today.</p>
<p>But if you've ever wanted math to be native on the web, then you have to realize that it <strong>won't happen without your help</strong>.</p>
<p>If you're too lazy for converting (e.g., when you're teaching), then use something that compiles to both TeX and HTML (like markdown+MathJax etc). Pick a decent tool for it, like <a href="http://www.inkcode.net/qute">Qute</a>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/retext/">ReText</a>, write on the web with <a href="http://fiduswriter.com/">FidusWriter</a> or <a href="http://authorea.com/">Authorea.com</a>, write in your favorite Mac-editor with <a href="http://markedapp.com/">Marked</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview">extend sublimetext</a>, on an iPad app use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/writing-kit-research-write/id426208994">Writing Kit</a> -- and that's just off the top of my head; there are many more editing environments that offer good syntax and MathJax integration. Many can save to TeX documents, anything can be converted via <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a>. It's not perfect yet but it won't get better unless you give everybody some feedback.</p>
<p>So, if you can, don't author LaTeX, author <em>into</em> LaTeX. And whatever you do, compile it to HTML. It's important.</p>

<p><em>Comments</em></p>

<li><strong>michalh21</strong>, 2013/05/30<br>
For LaTeX to html conversion, I would really recommend tex4ht, its problem is fragmentation of documentation, some information is completely missing, but on the other side it can convert any LaTeX document, it can be even configured to convert tikz pictures to svg, or to output math as <a href="http://www.albany.edu/~hammond/demos/Html5/arXiv/" rel="nofollow">mathml with mathjax rendering</a><br>
I think it is a good idea to output html for people who wants to read on tablets or smart phones, but personally, I still prefer to read PDFs, even on my laptop or PC. For me, PDF has advantage in better readability. HTML even with most recent trends like web fonts and responsive typography is still far behind PDF in this regard. Other advantage is pagination, it helps me with orientation in document. Maybe not so many readers pay attention to such things today, but I think majority of writers in LaTeX wouldn't like how bad their documents look in HTML.<br>
And last point :) I don't really think LaTeX is hard. For things that markdown etc. supports, like sections, tables, links or footnotes, it is only few commands to learn, every editor today supports snippets for fast inserting these commands, you can use templates for document preamble etc. And when you want to use things like referencing, bibliographies, indexing, glossaries etc, using LaTeX is much easier. Plus, for new functionality, you can write your own macros, which is easier than modifying markdown parser and inventing new syntax :)
<ul>
<li><strong>Peter</strong>, 2013/06/06<br>
Thanks for your comments. tex4ht is certainly a nice and powerful tool. But there’s a fundamental difference: it’s really a dvi-to-html converter, not a LaTeX-to-html one. That allows it to circumvent a lot of problems (by letting the TeX binary do all the hard work) but also comes with losses since LaTeX is semantically richer than TeX/DVI (something that’s visible in the quality of the MathML output last time I tried it).<br>
I understand that most people find PDFs better. IMO, HTML has much more potential than PDF to provide a better reading experience, with rich content and easy interaction with other web content (and of course PDFs are virtually inaccessible). My main point was merely that we won’t get there if we don’t get started. Authors, in any case, should care more about their readers than their own reading experience. They can, after all, produce whatever they like for themselves whereas a reader rarely has that option. (Personally, I prefer my handwritten notes but that won’t help anyone given my illegible hand writing)<br>
I’m definitely not trying to tell people what they should use. Certainly, an experienced user often finds LaTeX the most flexible and powerful tool (TeX is a programming language, after all). But this power brings an awful lot of problems with it and in almost all situation that power is not needed. So I do like to argue for the right tool for the job instead, especially in educational settings — and above all, I would like to argue for conversion. No tool or format is perfect. But any content that cannot be converted to something else is (for better or worse) at a dead end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Norman Lewis Perlmutter</strong>, 2013/06/04<br>
Given that LaTeX already compiles into pdf, might it be better to use or develop a pdf to html converter? This would have the added benefit of being able to convert pdf files not generated by LaTeX into html.
<ul>
<li><strong>Peter</strong>, 2013/06/06<br>
The short answer is: no. PDF is a very “loss-ful” format. The only way to extract e.g. mathematical content is by using heuristics, i.e., guessing from the placement what kind of expression was actually used. While converters like pdf.js do a good job at reproducing the layout, they do not really convert to HTML, they merely render it (much like a printer) — the output is inaccessible, doesn’t reflow well etc. TeX to HTML is already very solid and used in big publishing houses. Automatic conversion is perhaps at 95% — but to get to 100% (which is needed), the open source projects out there need feedback.<br>
Since the conversion from for strictly mathematical TeX to MathML is very solid, it’s much easier to go directly anyway. The only remaining problem are the messy packages, in particular the graphical packages that could either be converted to static graphics (like LaTeXML or tex4ht do) or re-implemented in javascript (like xyjax or mathapedia).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>jessemckeown</strong>. 2013/06/06<br>
Well, I’m doing my very little bit, then; since you mention it, though, is there any plan to eventually absorb xyjax into the main mathjax? AMScd does do the arrows nicer than putting <code>\to</code> and <code>\downarrow</code> in a <code>\begin{array}\end{array}</code>, but…
<ul>
<li><strong>jessemckeown</strong>, 2013/06/06<br>
Oh, I forgot to make sure of the right website…</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="AMD" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/amd.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
With the AMD Ryzen 7040 series "Ryzen AI" was introduced as leveraging Xilinx IP onboard the new Zen 4 mobile processors. Ryzen AI is beginning to work its way out to more processors while <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-Ryzen-AI-Open-Source-Demo">it hasn't been supported on Linux</a>. Then in October was <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Ryzen-AI-For-Linux-Requests">AMD wanting to hear from customer requests around Ryzen AI Linux support</a>. Well, today they did their first public code drop of the XDNA Linux driver for providing open-source support for Ryzen AI.
</p><p>
More than 1,000 requests for Linux support were logged following that October statement and since then I've been hearing quietly of AMD working on Linux support... Well, there's now an open-source but currently out-of-tree driver available. The XDNA driver will work with AMD Phoenix/Strix SoCs so far having Ryzen AI onboard. AMD has tested the driver to work on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS but you will need to be running the Linux 6.7 kernel or newer with IOMMU SVA support enabled. The Xilinx XRT software also needs to be built to work with this kernel driver. So far is a simple test script for verifying that your driver stack is currently setup.
</p><p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=2024&amp;image=amd_xdna_linux_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2024&amp;image=amd_xdna_linux_med" alt="AMD XDNA Linux driver"></a></p>
<p>Those wanting to check out this XDNA open-source Linux driver can find it via <a href="https://github.com/amd/xdna-driver">amd/xdna-driver on GitHub</a>.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2023&amp;image=ryzen_ai_1" alt="AMD Ryzen AI"></p>
<p>The documentation doesn't yet outline any upstreaming plans they have for this driver to get it into the mainline kernel or if they will just be maintaining it out-of-tree or what all their Linux support plans entail. In any event I'll be working on getting more information about their Ryzen AI / XDNA Linux plans for future article(s) on Phoronix as well as getting to trying this driver out once knowing the software support expectations.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The study, led by Canadian federal scientists, adds to other research that found Alberta's oil sands were underreporting climate changing carbon emissions.</p><div id="details-body" data-words="524" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Aircraft flying over Alberta’s oil sands have found emissions of organic carbon — a primary driver of air pollution — between 1,900 per cent and 6,300 per cent higher than industry has reported.</p>

<p>That’s more than all the organic carbon pollution emitted across Canada combined, according to the new study, led by Canadian federal scientists and published in the journal Science Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Drew Gentner, a researcher at Yale University’s Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering and one of 24 co-authors of&nbsp;the&nbsp;study, said the previously unaccounted for emissions from the Athabasca oil sands were largely made up of volatile organic compounds overlooked in routine monitoring. He said they were surprised by the massive gap.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“These compounds are important reactive chemicals in the atmosphere with implications for air quality and the environment,” said Gentner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those compounds react with sunlight to produce fine particulate matter — which is linked to major health and climate effects — and gases like ozone, a key component of smog and leading cause of pollution in Canadian cities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Organic carbon pollution levels were found to be more than 1,500 per cent higher than U.S. mega-cities like Los Angeles, Calif., a city long known for smog.</p>

<p>Ozone has also been known to reduce wheat crop yields by up to a third, costing agriculture&nbsp;in East Asia up to US$63 billion a year, according to one 2022 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00422-6" target="_blank">study</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Depending on the pollutant, air quality impacts can span from nearby communities in the region (e.g., Fort&nbsp;McMurray, Indigenous communities) to downwind impacts on humans and the environment,” said Gentner in an email.</p>

<p>Past monitoring has failed to capture the full scope of organic carbon pollution because it wasn’t looking at a diverse enough range of molecular sizes often associated with heavy oil and bitumen deposits. Such deposits&nbsp;are expected to account for 40 per cent of global oil production by 2040, the study found.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an estimated 1.7 trillion barrels of oil, the Alberta oil sands make up most of Canada’s oil production and a large share of its carbon pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Study the latest evidence industry is underreporting&nbsp;emissions</h3>

<p>In a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/2/5/pgad140/7127723?login=false" target="_blank">study</a> released last April, some of the same researchers at Environment and Climate Change Canada used aircraft, satellite and historical data to reassess climate changing emissions from the oil sands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They found the oil-producing region could be producing 31 million tonnes of unreported carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year — 65 per cent higher than industry reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The latest study found organic carbon pollution to be 20 to 64 times greater than&nbsp;reported in Canada’s National Pollutant Release Inventory, which is required the report the entire range of volatile organic compounds. That’s 13 per cent more than Canada’s entire annual output of organic carbon emissions.</p>

<p>“Measured [volatile organic compounds] only account for a fraction of total measured organic carbon,” said the study.</p>

<p>“Thus, the oil sands sector alone represents a dominant fraction of country-wide gas-phase organic carbon emissions, even when only including the facilities studied here.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The researchers concluded that current surveillance of organic carbon pollution would need to change if Canada were to accurately report the full air quality and environmental impacts of the oil sands operations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NASA’s history-making Ingenuity Mars Helicopter has ended its mission at the Red Planet after surpassing expectations and making dozens more flights than planned. While the helicopter remains upright and in communication with ground controllers, imagery of its Jan. 18 flight sent to Earth this week indicates one or more of its rotor blades sustained damage during landing, and it is no longer capable of flight.</p>
<p>Originally designed as a technology demonstration to perform up to five experimental test flights over 30 days, the first aircraft on another world operated from the Martian surface for almost three years, performed 72 flights, and flew more than 14 times farther than planned while logging more than two hours of total flight time.</p>
<p>“The historic journey of Ingenuity, the first aircraft on another planet, has come to end,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “That remarkable helicopter flew higher and farther than we ever imagined and helped NASA do what we do best – make the impossible, possible. Through missions like Ingenuity, NASA is paving the way for future flight in our solar system and smarter, safer human exploration to Mars and beyond.”</p>
<p><strong>NASA to Discuss Ingenuity Mission in Media Call Today</strong><em></em></p>
<p>In addition to video comments shared from Nelson about the mission’s conclusion, NASA will host a media teleconference at 5 p.m. EST today, Thursday, Jan. 25, to provide an update on Ingenuity Mars Helicopter.</p>
<p>Audio of the call will stream live on the agency’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasatv">website</a>.</p>
<p>Participants in the call are expected to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lori Glaze, director, Planetary Science Division, NASA’s Science Mission Directorate at the agency’s headquarters in Washington</li>
<li>Laurie Leshin, director, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California</li>
<li>Teddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity project manager, NASA JPL</li>
</ul>
<p>Media who wish to participate by phone can request dial-in information by emailing <a href="mailto:hq-media@mail.nasa.gov">hq-media@mail.nasa.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Ingenuity landed on Mars Feb. 18, 2021, attached to the belly of NASA’s Perseverance rover and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMnOo2zcjXA" rel="noopener">first lifted off</a> the Martian surface on April 19, proving that powered, controlled flight on Mars was possible. After notching another four flights, it embarked on a new mission as an <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-ingenuity-helicopter-to-begin-new-demonstration-phase" rel="noopener">operations demonstration</a>, serving as an <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/26251/mars-mound-from-ingenuity-helicopters-perspective-in-3d/" rel="noopener">aerial scout</a> for Perseverance scientists and rover drivers. In 2023, the helicopter executed two successful flight tests that further expanded the team’s knowledge of its aerodynamic limits.</p>
<p>“At NASA JPL, innovation is at the heart of what we do,” said Leshin. “Ingenuity is an exemplar of the way we push the boundaries of what’s possible every day. I’m incredibly proud of our team behind this historic technological achievement and eager to see what they’ll invent next.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ingenuity’s team planned for the helicopter to make a short vertical flight on Jan. 18 to determine its location after executing an emergency landing on its previous flight. Data shows that, as planned, the helicopter achieved a maximum altitude of 40 feet (12 meters) and hovered for 4.5 seconds before starting its descent at a velocity of 3.3 feet per second (1 meter per second).</p>
<p>However, about 3 feet (1 meter) above the surface, Ingenuity lost contact with the rover, which serves as a communications relay for the rotorcraft. The following day, communications were reestablished and more information about the flight was relayed to ground controllers at NASA JPL. Imagery revealing damage to the rotor blade arrived several days later. The cause of the communications dropout and the helicopter’s orientation at time of touchdown are still being investigated.</p>

<p>Over an extended mission that lasted for almost 1,000 Martian days, more than 33 times longer than originally planned, Ingenuity was upgraded with the ability to <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/27173/ingenuitys-hazard-avoidance-capability/" rel="noopener">autonomously choose landing sites</a> in treacherous terrain, dealt with a <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/385/keeping-our-sense-of-direction-dealing-with-a-dead-sensor/" rel="noopener">dead sensor</a>, cleaned itself after <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/366/dusty-flight-19-completed-and-looking-ahead-to-flight-20/" rel="noopener">dust storms</a>, operated from 48 different airfields, performed three emergency landings, and survived a frigid Martian winter.</p>



<p>Designed to operate in spring, Ingenuity was unable to power its heaters throughout the night during the coldest parts of winter, resulting in the flight computer periodically freezing and resetting. These power “brownouts” required the team to <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/382/ingenuity-adapts-for-mars-winter-operations/" rel="noopener">redesign Ingenuity’s winter operations</a> in order to keep flying.</p>



<p>With flight operations now concluded, the Ingenuity team will perform final tests on helicopter systems and download the remaining imagery and data in Ingenuity’s onboard memory. The Perseverance rover is currently too far away to attempt to image the helicopter at its final airfield.</p>



<p>“It’s humbling Ingenuity not only carries onboard a <a href="https://images.nasa.gov/details/PIA24291" rel="noopener">swatch</a> from the original Wright Flyer, but also this helicopter followed in its footsteps and proved flight is possible on another world,” said Ingenuity’s project manager, Teddy Tzanetos of NASA JPL. “The Mars helicopter would have never flown once, much less 72 times, if it were not for the passion and dedication of the Ingenuity and Perseverance teams. History’s first Mars helicopter will leave behind an indelible mark on the future of space exploration and will inspire fleets of aircraft on Mars – and other worlds – for decades to come.”</p>



<p><strong>More About Ingenuity</strong></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
	<p><span><span>A</span></span> historic new study out of Scotland shows the real-world impact of vaccines against the human papillomavirus: The country has detected no cases of cervical cancer in women born between 1988-1996 who were fully vaccinated against HPV between the ages of 12 and 13.</p>
<p>Many previous studies have shown that HPV vaccines are <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/08/hpv-vaccines-cancer-screenings/">extremely effective</a> in preventing cervical cancer. But the study, published on Monday in the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jnci/djad263/7577291?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=true#no-access-message" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Journal of the National Cancer Institute</a>, is the first to monitor a national cohort of women over such a long time period and find no occurrence of cervical cancer.</p>
<p>“The study is super exciting. It shows that the vaccine is extremely effective,” said Kathleen Schmeler, a professor of gynecologic oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, who was not involved in the research. “It’s obviously early. We’re just starting to see the first data of the impact of the vaccine because it takes so long from the time of the vaccine to the effects.”</p>
<p>The results underscore the importance of working to increase uptake of the HPV vaccine in the U.S., said Schmeler. Scotland, for example, introduced routine immunization in schools in 2008, and <a href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/hpv-immunisation-statistics-scotland/hpv-immunisation-statistics-scotland-school-year-202223/#:~:text=Coverage%20of%20the%20completed%20one,%2C%20a%20difference%20of%200.7%25." target="_blank" rel="noopener">close to 90%</a> of students in their fourth year of secondary school (equivalent to 10th grade in the U.S.) in the 2022-2023 school year had received at least one dose of the vaccine. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7234a3.htm#:~:text=In%202022%2C%2089.9%25%20of%20adolescents,HPV%20vaccination%20(HPV%20UTD)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the U.S.</a>, where HPV vaccines are not administered in school, uptake among adolescents ages 13 to 17 is a little over 60%.</p>
		
		
<p>The study also points to how crucial the timing of vaccination is. “The girls that didn’t develop any cancer were vaccinated before becoming sexually active,” said Schlemer. “So we should not wait to vaccinate folks and really do it, for the guidelines, prior to becoming sexually active.”</p>
<h2>The benefits of receiving the HPV vaccine before age 14</h2>
<p>The authors of the Scotland study monitored the records of all women born between 1988 and 1996 who were eligible for cancer screening, about 450,000 women. Of that group, 40,000 were vaccinated between the ages of 12 and 13, and 124,000 received the vaccines at or after 14 years of age. The remaining women, nearly 300,000, were not vaccinated.</p>
<p>No cases of cervical cancer were found among the women who were vaccinated before they turned 14, even if they had only received one or two doses of the vaccine rather than the full, three-dose protocol. Also noteworthy is that women who received the three-dose protocol between the ages of 14 and 22 also benefited significantly. While some cases of cervical cancer were recorded in this group, the incidence (3.2 cases per 100,000 women) was two and a half times lower than among unvaccinated women (8.4 cases per 100,000 women).</p>
		
		
<p>“I was very surprised that there were no cases” of cancer in the group who received vaccines before 14, said Tim Palmer, the former clinical lead for cervical screening in Scotland and an HPV immunization consultant at Public Health Scotland, who was a lead author of the study. “In that age group, I expected about 15 to 17 a year in Scotland — and we have had none.”</p>
<p>The types of vaccine administered to the cohorts monitored in the study changed as newer ones became available, covering more types of HPV. Until 2012, the vaccine in use was the bivalent Cervarix, targeting HPV 16 and 18. Then the quadrivalent Gardasil was administered until 2023, when the nonavalent Gardasil 9 was introduced.</p>
<p>This is why it’s still possible that cervical cancers may still arise even in vaccinated women, caused by the HPV strains not targeted by the earlier vaccines. “There are obviously other HPV types that cause cancer,” Palmer said, noting that the current results don’t mean cases of cervical cancers, caused by less high-risk strains of HPV, won’t emerge in the analyzed cohort in the future.</p>
		
		
<p>The study’s findings don’t diminish the need for continued screenings for early detection of cervical cancers caused by HPV types that were not targeted in the original bivalent vaccine, said Palmer, but the vaccines effectively targeted the more aggressive strains of HPV (16 and 18).</p>
<p>The impact of the vaccination was also greater among women of lower socioeconomic status, who otherwise reported higher occurrences of cancer, said Palmer.</p>
<p>Ville Pimenoff, a senior researcher at the Karolinska Institutet and professor at the University of Oulu in Finland, published the results of a large cohort study in Finland <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/08/hpv-vaccines-cancer-screenings/">in November 2023</a>, which showed the effectiveness of cohort vaccination in creating herd immunity against HPV. He said the results from Scotland confirm his findings. “When you vaccinate in a cohort way, there seems to be very strong, protective immunity in those communities,” said Pimenoff, who was not involved in the Scottish study.</p>

For example, when using a vector data store that only supports embeddings up to 1024 dimensions long, developers can now still use our best embeddings model <code>text-embedding-3-large</code> and specify a value of 1024 for the <code>dimensions</code> API parameter, which will shorten the embedding down from 3072 dimensions, trading off some accuracy in exchange for the smaller vector size.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="other-new-models-and-lower-pricing" data-heading=""><p><h2>Other new models and lower pricing</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="updated-gpt-3-5-turbo-model-and-lower-pricing" data-heading=""><p><h3>Updated GPT-3.5 Turbo model and lower pricing</h3></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>Next week we are introducing a new GPT-3.5 Turbo model, <code>gpt-3.5-turbo-0125</code>, and for the third time in the past year, we will be decreasing prices on GPT-3.5 Turbo to help our customers scale.

        <div>
             
                 <div><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span>&nbsp;Apple today announced changes to iOS, Safari, and the App Store impacting developers’ apps in the European Union (EU) to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The changes include more than 600 new APIs, expanded app analytics, functionality for alternative browser engines, and options for processing app payments and distributing iOS apps. Across every change, Apple is introducing new safeguards that reduce — but don’t eliminate — new risks the DMA poses to EU users. With these steps, Apple will continue to deliver the best, most secure experience possible for EU users.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The new options for processing payments and downloading apps on iOS open new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats. That’s why Apple is introducing protections — including Notarization for iOS apps, an authorization for marketplace developers, and disclosures on alternative payments — to reduce risks and deliver the best, most secure experience possible for users in the EU. Even with these safeguards in place, many risks remain.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Developers can learn about these changes on the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-analytics-exit-link="">Apple Developer Support page</a><span> and can begin&nbsp;testing&nbsp;new capabilities today in the iOS 17.4 beta. The new capabilities will become available to users in the 27 EU countries beginning in March 2024.</span>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“The changes we’re announcing today comply with the Digital Markets Act’s requirements in the European Union, while helping to protect EU users from the unavoidable increased privacy and security threats this regulation brings. Our priority remains creating the best, most secure possible experience for our users in the EU and around the world,” said Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow. “Developers can now learn about the new tools and terms available for alternative app distribution and alternative payment processing, new capabilities for alternative browser engines and contactless payments, and more. Importantly, developers can choose to remain on the same business terms in place today if they prefer.”
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The changes for EU apps reflect the European Commission’s designation of iOS, Safari, and the App Store as “core platform services” under the Digital Markets Act. In March, Apple will share new resources to help EU users understand the changes they can expect. That includes guidance to help EU users navigate complexities the DMA’s changes bring — including a less intuitive user experience — and best practices for approaching new risks associated with downloading apps and processing payments outside of the App Store.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Available for developers’ apps around the world, Apple also announced <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-analytics-exit-link="">new options for streaming games</a>, along with more than 50 forthcoming reports in areas like engagement, commerce, app usage, and more.
</div>
                 
             
                 <h2>Changes to iOS
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>In the EU, Apple is making a number of changes to iOS to comply with the DMA. For developers, those changes include new options for distributing apps. The coming changes to iOS in the EU include:
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>New options for distributing iOS apps from alternative app marketplaces</strong><span> — including new APIs and tools that enable developers to offer their iOS apps for download from alternative app marketplaces.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>New framework and APIs for creating alternative app marketplaces</strong> — enabling marketplace developers to install apps and manage updates on behalf of other developers from their dedicated marketplace app.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>New frameworks and APIs for alternative browser engines</strong> — enabling developers to use browser engines, other than WebKit, for browser apps and apps with in-app browsing experiences.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Interoperability request form</strong> — where developers can submit additional requests for interoperability with iPhone and iOS hardware and software features.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>As announced by the European Commission, Apple is also sharing DMA-compliant changes impacting contactless payments. That includes new APIs enabling developers to use NFC technology in their banking and wallet apps throughout the European Economic Area. And in the EU, Apple is introducing new controls that allow users to select a third-party contactless payment app — or an alternative app marketplace — as their default.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Inevitably, the new options for developers’ EU apps create new risks to Apple users and their devices. Apple can’t eliminate those risks, but within the DMA’s constraints, the company will take steps to reduce them. These safeguards will be in place when users download iOS 17.4 or later, beginning in March, and include:
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Notarization for iOS apps</strong> — a baseline review that applies to all apps, regardless of their distribution channel, focused on platform integrity and protecting users. Notarization involves a combination of automated checks and human review.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>App installation sheets</strong> — that use information from the Notarization process to provide at-a-glance descriptions of apps and their functionality before download, including the developer, screenshots, and other essential information.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Authorization for marketplace developers</strong> — to ensure marketplace developers commit to ongoing requirements that help protect users and developers.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Additional malware protections</strong> — that prevent iOS apps from launching if they’re found to contain malware after being installed to a user’s device.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>These protections — including Notarization for iOS apps, and authorization for marketplace developers — help reduce some of the privacy and security risks to iOS users in the EU. That includes threats like malware or malicious code, and risks of installing apps that misrepresent their functionality or the responsible developer.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>However, Apple has less ability to address other risks — including apps that contain scams, fraud, and abuse, or that expose users to illicit, objectionable, or harmful content. In addition, apps that use alternative browser engines — other than Apple’s WebKit — may negatively affect the user experience, including impacts to system performance and battery life.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Within the DMA’s constraints, Apple is committed to protecting the privacy, security, and quality of the iOS user experience in the EU as much as possible. For instance, App Tracking Transparency will continue to work with apps distributed outside of the App Store — asking a user’s permission before a developer tracks their data across apps or websites. However, the DMA’s requirements mean that App Store features — including Family Purchase Sharing and Ask to Buy — will not be compatible with apps downloaded from outside of the App Store.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>When these changes come into effect in March, Apple will share more detailed resources explaining the options available to users — including best practices for protecting their privacy and security.
</div>
                 
             
                 <h2>Changes to Safari
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Today, iOS users already have the ability to set a third-party web browser — other than Safari — as their default. Reflecting the DMA’s requirements, Apple is also introducing a new choice screen that will surface when users first open Safari in iOS 17.4 or later. That screen will prompt EU users to choose a default browser from a list of options.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>This change is a result of the DMA’s requirements, and means that EU users will be confronted with a list of default browsers before they have the opportunity to understand the options available to them. The screen also interrupts EU users’ experience the first time they open Safari intending to navigate to a webpage.
</div>
                 
             
                 <h2>Changes to the App Store
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>On the App Store, Apple is sharing a number of changes for developers with apps in the EU, affecting apps across Apple’s operating systems — including iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. The changes also include new disclosures informing EU users of the risks associated with using alternatives to the App Store’s secure payment processing.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>For developers, those changes include:<br>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>New options for using payment service providers (PSPs)</strong> — within a developer’s app to process payments for digital goods and services.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>New options for processing payments via link-out </strong>— where users can complete a transaction for digital goods and services on the developer’s external website. Developers can also inform EU users of promotions, discounts, and other deals available outside of their apps.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Business planning tools </strong>— for developers to estimate fees and understand metrics associated with Apple’s new business terms for apps in the EU.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The changes also include new steps to protect and inform EU users, including:
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong><em></em>App Store product page labels</strong> — that inform users when an app they’re downloading uses alternative payment processing.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong><em></em>In-app disclosure sheets</strong> — that let users know when they are no longer transacting with Apple, and when a developer is directing them to transact using an alternative payment processor.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong><em></em>New</strong> <strong>App Review processes</strong> — to verify that developers accurately communicate information about transactions that use alternative payment processors.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Expanded data portability on Apple’s Data &amp; Privacy site </strong>— where EU users can retrieve new data about their usage of the App Store and export it to an authorized third party.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>For apps that use alternative payment processing, Apple will not be able to issue refunds, and will have less ability to support customers encountering issues, scams, or fraud. Helpful App Store features — like Report a Problem, Family Sharing, and Ask to Buy — will also not reflect these transactions. Users may have to share their payment information with additional parties, creating more opportunities for bad actors to steal sensitive financial information. And on the App Store, users’ purchase history and subscription management will only reflect transactions made using the App Store’s In-App Purchase system.
</div>
                 
             
                 <h2>New Business Terms for Apps in the EU
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Also today, Apple is sharing new business terms available for developers’ apps in the European Union. Developers can choose to adopt these new business terms, or stay on Apple’s existing terms. Developers must adopt the new business terms for EU apps to use the new capabilities for alternative distribution or alternative payment processing.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The new business terms for apps in the EU are necessary to support the DMA’s requirements for alternative distribution and payment processing. That includes a fee structure that reflects the many ways Apple creates value for developers’ businesses — including distribution and discovery on the App Store, the App Store’s secure payment processing, Apple’s trusted and secure mobile platform, and all the tools and technology to build and share innovative apps with users around the world.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Developers operating under either set of business terms can continue to use the App Store’s secure payment processing and share their apps on the App Store in the EU. And both sets of business terms reflect Apple’s long-standing work to make the app ecosystem the best opportunity for all developers.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Developers operating under the new business terms will have the option to distribute their iOS apps from the App Store and/or alternative app marketplaces. These developers can also choose to use alternative payment processors in their EU apps on the App Store, across Apple’s operating systems.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The new business terms for iOS apps in the EU have three elements:
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Reduced commission</strong> — iOS apps on the App Store will pay a reduced commission of either 10 percent (for the vast majority of developers, and subscriptions following their first year) or 17 percent on transactions for digital goods and services.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong><em></em>Payment processing fee</strong> — iOS apps on the App Store can use the App Store’s payment processing for an additional 3 percent fee. Developers can use a payment service provider within their app or link users to their website to process payments for no additional fee to Apple.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong><em></em>Core Technology Fee</strong> — iOS apps distributed from the App Store and/or an alternative app marketplace will pay €0.50 for each first annual install per year over a 1 million threshold.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
         </div>

      CVE-2023-40547 - avoid incorrectly trusting HTTP headers
    </p>

    <div><pre>When retrieving files via HTTP or related protocols, shim attempts to
allocate a buffer to store the received data.  Unfortunately, this means
getting the size from an HTTP header, which can be manipulated to
specify a size that's smaller than the received data.  In this case, the
code accidentally uses the header for the allocation but the protocol
metadata to copy it from the rx buffer, resulting in an out-of-bounds
write.

This patch adds an additional check to test that the rx buffer is not
larger than the allocation.

Resolves: CVE-2023-40547

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><h2 id="what-does-a-database-have-to-do-with-ai-anyway">What does a database have to do with AI, anyway?</h2><p>After a truly new technology arrives, it makes the future a lot harder to predict. The one thing you can be sure of is that you’re probably not going to continue in the same straight line that you’ve been traveling. The truly impactful destinations are often just on the other side of a mountain that you can’t yet see the top of. This is also what makes technology so terrifying: once the mist clears you might find yourself in a totally new landscape without a map.</p><p>At MotherDuck, we’re excited about ways that AI can be used to help give people superpowers to understand their data. Someone with access to modern Google search would have looked like a wizard to people just a few decades ago; now we take it for granted that you can instantly settle any bet about how old is Morgan Freeman or when was the last time the Seattle Mariners won the World Series. Similarly, AI has the potential to divide the world into “things you did before AI” and “things you did afterwards.”</p><p>It was pretty clear to us that AI was already changing how people interact with their data when one of our early users mentioned they were spending a lot of their time cutting and pasting between ChatGPT and the MotherDuck query UI. That seems super inefficient, and since then we’ve been trying to figure out how to shorten feedback loops and make data practitioners better at their jobs. Any time you have to leave the query you’re writing to check documentation, it distracts you from all of the details you’re keeping track of in your head.</p><p>Two weeks ago, in order to help analysts stay focused on their SQL, we <a href="https://motherduck.com/blog/introducing-fixit-ai-sql-error-fixer/">launched “FixIt,”</a> a feature that can pinpoint which line in your query has an error and suggest a fix. While “FixIt” is pretty simple, it can be surprisingly helpful. Instead of having to look up syntax for things like window functions with trailing averages or timestamp differencing, I can just write the SQL I think should work; if I get the ordering of arguments wrong, misspell something, or use the wrong quote type, “FixIt” will automatically write it correctly.</p><p>This week we’re taking the next step; in conjunction with <a href="https://www.numbersstation.ai/">Numbers Station</a>, we’re open sourcing a DuckDB specific text-to-SQL LLM. Our goal here is to give back to the DuckDB community and help seed interesting DuckDB applications. For the moment, we’ve chosen to trade off some expressivity for faster and less expensive inference by using a small-ish model size. If this turns out to be an interesting area we will follow up more.</p><p>We hope that you’ll come along with us as we continue to explore the ways that AI can make it easier to solve problems with data.</p></section>
<section><h2 id="about-duckdb-nsql">About DuckDB-NSQL</h2><p>We currently provide <a href="https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/using-ml-to-query/">text-to-SQL functionality</a> within MotherDuck, using OpenAI’s most powerful models, that are doing exceptionally well on text-to-SQL <a href="https://yale-lily.github.io/spider">benchmarks</a> and have been proven useful in practice. We do, however, see a need for more lightweight models that enable DucKDB SQL assistance features at lower latency. Upon reviewing existing open models for text-to-SQL, we came to the realization that existing models and benchmarks primarily focus on analytical queries / SELECT statements.</p><p>Beyond fast analytical querying using regular SQL, a significant part of DuckDB's appeal lies in its <a href="https://duckdb.org/2022/05/04/friendlier-sql.html#group-by-all">friendly SQL</a> syntax, support for <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/data_types/overview#nesting">nested types</a>, varied <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/data/overview">data import</a> options, and its diverse ecosystem of <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/archive/0.9.2/extensions/overview">extensions</a>. Among others, extensions for querying Postgres, SQLite, and Iceberg tables, and support for JSON and GeoSpatial types.</p><p>We believe that text-to-SQL in the context of DuckDB is particularly useful if the model can help users leverage the full power of DuckDB, without having to go forth-and-back between the DuckDB documentation and the SQL shell. We’ve all been there!</p><p>With DuckDB-NSQL-7B, we’re now releasing a text-to-SQL model that is aware of all documented features in DuckDB 0.9.2, including official extensions! Think of it as a documentation oracle that always gives you the exact DuckDB SQL query you are looking for.</p><p>The model was trained on about 200k synthetically generated and validated DuckDB SQL queries, guided by the DuckDB documentation, and more than 250k general <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/NumbersStation/NSText2SQL">Text-2-SQL questions from Numbers Station</a>, which makes the model not only capable of generating handy DuckDB snippets but also to generate SQL queries for answering analytical question.</p><p>We fully release the model weights on <a href="https://huggingface.co/motherduckdb/DuckDB-NSQL-7B-v0.1">Hugging Face</a>. and also release the model in a quantized <a href="https://huggingface.co/motherduckdb/DuckDB-NSQL-7B-v0.1-GGUF">GGUF format</a>, for use with llama.cpp.</p><p><em>Read up more about how we created and evaluated DuckDB-NSQL-7B on <a href="http://www.numbersstation.ai/post/duckdb-nsql-how-to-quack-in-sql">Numbers Station’s blog post</a></em></p></section>

<p><img alt="[Image: Mickey Mouse whistling on the bridge of a steamboat.]" data-original-height="600" data-original-width="720" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgmpMyJpJ8YH4hEKMKde_Pow2smdNeAH6fSTNsUd-g0ZOzvJRNoDwj0N1WNQL82P5MMJSZrz83kgqX9K86wFDNtde3Fczi4X8juTW3orD9acpHU3OrdTbAvqq2IfILDZJFvZtaav4JT1HbDybzN7sNyxr0ilR5mQMr0QZTF0Qb_r615A421JOMBvHli4fIX/s480/mikki.jpg" width="240"></p>

<p><em>Steamboat Willie</em> (1928) was one of the earliest cartoons with synchronized sound. That is, it had post-production sound effects; this was something new and exciting. Now that the cartoon has recently entered the public domain<a href="#bbc24">[bbc24]</a> we can safely delve into its famous soundtrack. See, there's something interesting about how it sounds...</p>

<p>If you listen closely to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5pG1wbRKOg" title="Steamboat Willie (1928 Film) - 4K Film Remaster">soundtrack on Youtube</a> it sounds somehow distorted. You might be tempted to point out that it's 96 years old, yes. But you might also recognize that it is suffering from <em>flutter</em>, i.e. an unstable playback or recording speed.</p>

<p>In the spirit of this blog let's geek out for a bit and study this flutter distortion further. Can we learn something interesting? Could we perhaps learn enough to be able to reduce it?</p>

<p>Of course the flutter might be 100% authentic to how it sounded in theatres in the 1920s; we don't know when and why it appeared in the audio (more on that later!). It might have sounded even worse. But we can still hope to enjoy the sound effects in their original recorded form.</p>

<h3>Prior work</h3>

<p>I'm not the first one to notice this clip is 'fluttering' and to try and do something about it. I found videos of people's attempts to un-flutter it using Celemony Capstan, a professional tool made just for this purpose, with varying results. Capstan uses Melodyne's famous note detection engine to detect musical features and then controls a varispeed effect to cancel out any flutter.</p>

<p>But Capstan is expensive, and it's more fun to come up with a home-made solution anyway. And what about non-musical sounds? Besides, I had some code laying around in a forgotten desk drawer that just might fit the purpose.</p>

<h3>Finding a high quality source</h3>

<p>Why would I need a high-quality digital file of a poor-quality soundtrack from the 1920s? I guess it's the archivist in me hoping that it has been preserved with high level of detail. But also, if you're going to try and dig up some hidden details in the sound, you'd want minimal interference from any lossy psychoacoustic compression, right? These artifacts might become audible after varispeed effects and could also hinder frequency detection.</p>

<p>The high-quality <a href="https://archive.org/details/steamboat-willie-4-k-resolution">source</a> I found is in the Internet Archive. It might originally be coming from the 4K Blu-Ray release called Celebrating Mickey. The spectrogram doesn't show almost any compression artifacts that I can see, even in the quietest frequency ranges! Perfect!</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhC59_S2FfWRnMghfZ4QuHa4GEugXiwUtUudblRrARDPO-v171yCcH4ri_lUxGpkcWCbh1d6htKfH7CSqmMjjJpG0id9XcyMLNTz2k5yVn2jTDvWu62jhr1bl0BOugwiI2CepLB3Y20DwI2sPGV_kQvPmt1nNdwvQPFVVeHVk-9JtyuxoUyyLCiG3IhXd-e/s1100/film_scan.jpg"><img alt="[Image: A single film frame.]" data-original-height="457" data-original-width="1100" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhC59_S2FfWRnMghfZ4QuHa4GEugXiwUtUudblRrARDPO-v171yCcH4ri_lUxGpkcWCbh1d6htKfH7CSqmMjjJpG0id9XcyMLNTz2k5yVn2jTDvWu62jhr1bl0BOugwiI2CepLB3Y20DwI2sPGV_kQvPmt1nNdwvQPFVVeHVk-9JtyuxoUyyLCiG3IhXd-e/s800/film_scan.jpg%202x" width="400"></a></p>

<p>But the Internet Archive <a href="https://archive.org/details/steamboat-willie-16mm-film-scan-4k-lossless">delivers</a> something even better. There's a lossless 4K scan of the movie with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound-on-film">optical soundtrack</a> partially included (above)! The lossless version is 34 GB, but there's a downscaled 480p MP4 one thousandth of the size.</p><p>I listened to the optical soundtrack from this low-resolution version with a little pixel-reader script. Turns out the flutter is already present on the film! (Edit: Note that we don't know where this particular film print came from. When was it created? Is there an original somewhere, without flutter?)</p>

<h3>Hand-guiding a frequency tracker</h3>

<p>Looking at the above spectrogram, we can see that the frequency of everything is zig-zagging as a function of time – that's flutter all right. But how to quantify these variations? We could zoom in on one of the frequency peaks and follow the course of its frequency in time. I'm using FFT peak interpolation to find more accurate frequency estimates<a href="#gasior04" title="">[gasior04]</a>.</p>

<p>Take the sound of Pete's tobacco hitting the ship's bell around the 01'45'' mark. You'd think a bell is supposed to have a constant frequency, yet this one sounds quite unstable. We can follow any one of the harmonics and see how the playback speed (bell frequency) varies over the period of one second:</p>

<p>To my eye, this oscillation looks periodic and not random at all. We can run another round of FFT on a longer stretch of samples to find the strongest period of these fluctuations: It turns out to be 15 Hz. (Why 15? I so hoped it would have been 24 Hz – it would have made a more interesting story! More on that later...)</p>

<p>Okay, so can we repeat this process for the whole movie? I don't think we can just automatically follow the frequency of every peak, since some sounds will naturally contain vibration and rises and drops in frequency. Not all of it is due to flutter. Some sort of a vetting process is needed. We could try a tedious manual route...</p>

<p>I made a little software tool (above) where I could click and drag little boxes onto a spectrogram to search for peaks in. This wobbly line is then simply taken to be the speed variation (red graph in the top picture).</p>

<p>It became quite a chore to annotate longer sounds as this software didn't come with undo, edit, or save features for the longest time!</p>

<p>Now let's think about what to do with this speed information...</p>

<h3>Desk drawer deep dive</h3>

<p>Some time ago I had made a tool that could well come in handy now. It was for correcting wobbly wideband radio recordings stored on VHS tapes. These recordings contained some empty carriers that happened to work like seismographs, accurately recording the tape speed variations. The tool then used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial">Lagrange polynomial</a> to interpolate new samples at a steady interval, so called 'digital varispeed'.</p>

<p>It was ultimately based on an interesting paper on de-fluttering magnetic tapes using the tape bias signal as reference<a href="#howarth04">[howarth04]</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-ftP_bhx7_ijHh3uG18VJRLnLsRbKWaho5kgEz3Hu5y5m5R1pYC3BivLZunACRMAllEkv4YrMKk1ANe3YVOeyuM2rvzMEW8LoHJqyewoU8B6ABosgMbwAptHtv4VTwU0zbKB6fJP5Qx36iiDS8Pm-ok9yAd9EYUfQO06Oi8-JSQp0UIe0LPhcsV4hqP6P/s547/1981.jpg"><img alt="[Image: Buttons of an old device, one of them Varispeed, labeled 1981.

<p>Here's what this digital varispeed sounds like when exaggerated. In the below example I'm doing it in a simpler way. Instead of the Lagrange method I first upsampled some music by 10x in an audio software; hand-drew a speed curve in Audacity; and then used that curve to pick samples out of the oversampled music:</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRocIM1OFdKzStrX8VTZ_pZnynkIJRxVZzCKjdBIkCa9FqKFTXNrYfwUBvsO0dp0iy0FpivP1g_FQboHFDF3xgNcWd303GLKqwH3s3NB2hyphenhyphenwhXyNdi3kNUMhS07pEdQw9cbcmaRZ94IGMfwdLfqDsIj9vh4PH2Qtqpvr6kJGZipaShCdrVYg-j59Sjo9Cy/s1501/speed-variations.png"><img alt="[Image: A waveform in Audacity.]" data-original-height="182" data-original-width="1501" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRocIM1OFdKzStrX8VTZ_pZnynkIJRxVZzCKjdBIkCa9FqKFTXNrYfwUBvsO0dp0iy0FpivP1g_FQboHFDF3xgNcWd303GLKqwH3s3NB2hyphenhyphenwhXyNdi3kNUMhS07pEdQw9cbcmaRZ94IGMfwdLfqDsIj9vh4PH2Qtqpvr6kJGZipaShCdrVYg-j59Sjo9Cy/s550/speed-variations.png" srcset="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRocIM1OFdKzStrX8VTZ_pZnynkIJRxVZzCKjdBIkCa9FqKFTXNrYfwUBvsO0dp0iy0FpivP1g_FQboHFDF3xgNcWd303GLKqwH3s3NB2hyphenhyphenwhXyNdi3kNUMhS07pEdQw9cbcmaRZ94IGMfwdLfqDsIj9vh4PH2Qtqpvr6kJGZipaShCdrVYg-j59Sjo9Cy/s1100/speed-variations.png 2x" width="550"></a></p>



<p>Carefully controlled, this effect can be used to cancel out flutter. Here's how: If we knew exactly how the playback speed was fluctuating we could instantly vary the speed of our resampler in the opposite direction, thus canceling the variations. And with the above research we now have that knowledge!</p>

<p>Well, almost. I couldn't always see a clear frequency peak to follow, so the graph is patchy. But.. Maybe it could help to band-pass the speed signal at 15 Hz? This would help fill out small gaps and also preserve vibrato and other fluctuations that aren't part of the flutter distortion. We can at least try!</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0n3FreUSaXNwU3f4_NacMaZACdrpp-bcD3AGkqcOLVPbVbGDs34gKuhIYvmzoW8sBSLWWJ1UwhJVefJ7HPRSFV3sw93N2oPVT5p98J54dQz6kQEiAPE_HKoej4DE4dXHtbMREBfLOX43NVzJ8LgETuGbJKS6KET1NqhfyXqmn8FOW3Pw579ivisEsNnU5/s1028/flutter-filter.png"><img alt="[Image: Two waveforms, one of them piecewise and noisy, the other one smooth and continuous.]" data-original-height="244" data-original-width="1028" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0n3FreUSaXNwU3f4_NacMaZACdrpp-bcD3AGkqcOLVPbVbGDs34gKuhIYvmzoW8sBSLWWJ1UwhJVefJ7HPRSFV3sw93N2oPVT5p98J54dQz6kQEiAPE_HKoej4DE4dXHtbMREBfLOX43NVzJ8LgETuGbJKS6KET1NqhfyXqmn8FOW3Pw579ivisEsNnU5/s550/flutter-filter.png" srcset="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0n3FreUSaXNwU3f4_NacMaZACdrpp-bcD3AGkqcOLVPbVbGDs34gKuhIYvmzoW8sBSLWWJ1UwhJVefJ7HPRSFV3sw93N2oPVT5p98J54dQz6kQEiAPE_HKoej4DE4dXHtbMREBfLOX43NVzJ8LgETuGbJKS6KET1NqhfyXqmn8FOW3Pw579ivisEsNnU5/s1100/flutter-filter.png 2x" width="550"></a></p>

<p>In the example above, I replaced empty parts with a constant value of 100% and then filtered the whole thing. This sews the disjointed parts together in a smooth way.</p>

<h3>Can we hear some examples already?</h3>

<p>This clip is from when the goat ate Minnie's sheet music and guitar – the apparent catalyst event that sent Mickey Mouse to seek revenge on the entire animal kingdom.</p>

<p>You can definitely hear the difference in the bell-like sounds coming from the goats insides. It even sounds like the little flute notes in the beginning are easier to tell apart in the corrected version.</p>

<p>The cow's moo. That's a hard one because it's so rich in harmonics, in the spectrogram it looks almost like a <em>spaghetti bolognese</em>. My algorithm is constrained to a box and can't stay with one harmonic when the 'moo' slides in frequency. You can hear some artifacts because of this, but still the result sounds less sheep-like than the original.</p>

<h3>Sidetrack 1: Anything else we can find?</h3>

<p>Glad you're still reading! Let's step away from flutter for a while and take the raw audio track itself under the Fourier microscope. Zooming closer, is there anything interesting in the lower end?</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhpgDAGqXTHKKLEf-Nsc4U2aBDg1NhpfQnoLcZt9fPXrh5LgosyzGyRckaNuA9O1Gb0XRKevcuwdFx9ZtCXGNKn5SNrrbGoMIHmNPjJW8_phqO4ZcB02wHAPpsin8q4yWw1WXI41Ly6l5tUYrm5kPC75aUH6jr1H8NIWW86Oe80bgwO5Rf8EcmCjsb_1vi5/s1074/annotated-200px.jpg"><img alt="[Image: Spectrogram showing a frequency range from 0 to 180 Hz.]" data-original-height="296" data-original-width="1074" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhpgDAGqXTHKKLEf-Nsc4U2aBDg1NhpfQnoLcZt9fPXrh5LgosyzGyRckaNuA9O1Gb0XRKevcuwdFx9ZtCXGNKn5SNrrbGoMIHmNPjJW8_phqO4ZcB02wHAPpsin8q4yWw1WXI41Ly6l5tUYrm5kPC75aUH6jr1H8NIWW86Oe80bgwO5Rf8EcmCjsb_1vi5/s550/annotated-200px.jpg" srcset="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhpgDAGqXTHKKLEf-Nsc4U2aBDg1NhpfQnoLcZt9fPXrh5LgosyzGyRckaNuA9O1Gb0XRKevcuwdFx9ZtCXGNKn5SNrrbGoMIHmNPjJW8_phqO4ZcB02wHAPpsin8q4yWw1WXI41Ly6l5tUYrm5kPC75aUH6jr1H8NIWW86Oe80bgwO5Rf8EcmCjsb_1vi5/s1100/annotated-200px.jpg 2x" width="550"></a></p>

<p>We can faintly see peaks at multiples of both 24 and 60 Hz. No surprises there, really... 24 Hz being the film framerate and 60 Hz the North American mains frequency. Was there a projector running in the recording studio? Or maybe it's an artifact of scanning the soundtrack one frame at a time? In any case, these sounds are pretty weak.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgmJ6HtiyVj-yVW0JA7Ae5VYVOLhNuSfVoam0-yXFdzlKW6u1LeVuulZ872Jv7i8ec3-ofsac_qnXfL78uXDvydAiiOc97mPVXO03fLrR6rOPQv4n26REMoqsqOgwRIlkv1VzxaZI0ZOmYAZWCzT_FsVv4nldRBxQDIvxZ9OgsuFUOxFUUfcHsLJmiaBdoa/s856/sidebands.jpg"><img alt="[Image: Spectrogram showing tones with apparent sidebands.]" data-original-height="275" data-original-width="856" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgmJ6HtiyVj-yVW0JA7Ae5VYVOLhNuSfVoam0-yXFdzlKW6u1LeVuulZ872Jv7i8ec3-ofsac_qnXfL78uXDvydAiiOc97mPVXO03fLrR6rOPQv4n26REMoqsqOgwRIlkv1VzxaZI0ZOmYAZWCzT_FsVv4nldRBxQDIvxZ9OgsuFUOxFUUfcHsLJmiaBdoa/s550/sidebands.jpg" srcset="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgmJ6HtiyVj-yVW0JA7Ae5VYVOLhNuSfVoam0-yXFdzlKW6u1LeVuulZ872Jv7i8ec3-ofsac_qnXfL78uXDvydAiiOc97mPVXO03fLrR6rOPQv4n26REMoqsqOgwRIlkv1VzxaZI0ZOmYAZWCzT_FsVv4nldRBxQDIvxZ9OgsuFUOxFUUfcHsLJmiaBdoa/s1100/sidebands.jpg 2x" width="550"></a></p>

<p>In some places you can see some sort of modulation that seems to be generating sidebands, just like in radio signals. It's especially visible in Mickey's whistle when it's flutter-corrected, here at the 5-second mark. The sidebands peaks are 107 and 196 Hz away from the 'carrier' if you will. I'm not sure what this could be. Fluctuating amplitude?</p>

<h3>Sidetrack 2: Playing sound-on-film frame by frame?</h3>

<p>This is an experiment I did some time ago. It's just a silly thought - what would happen if the soundtrack was being read in the same way as the picture is – stopped 24 times per second? Would this be the <em>ultimate</em> flutter distortion?</p>

<p>In the olden days, sound was stored on the film next to the picture frames as analog information. Unlike the picture frames that had to be stopped momentarily for projection, the sound had to be played at a constant speed. There was a complicated mechanism in the projector to make this possible.</p>

<p>I found some speed curves for old-school movie projectors in <a href="https://www.windytan.com/2024/01/bickford72">[bickford72]</a>. They describe the film's deceleration and acceleration during these stops. Let's emulate these speed curves in audio with the oversampling varispeed method.</p>

<p>The video below is a 3D animation where this same speed curve controls an animation of a moving film in an imaginary machine. The clip is from another 1920s animation, <em>Alice in the Wooly West</em> (1926).</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6yyuMOBck2s?rel=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><em>~~ Now we know ~~</em></p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We found a 15 Hz speed fluctuation that was, to some extent, reversible.</li>
  <li>This flutter signal is already present in the optical soundtrack of a film scan.</li>
  <li>With enough manual work, much of the soundtrack could probably be 'corrected'.</li>
  <li>'Hmm, that sounds odd' are sometimes the words of a white rabbit.</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>Last time, I discussed the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/trade-offs-between-different-crdts">trade-offs between more traditional CRDTs</a>, such as the State-based CRDT, Op-based CRDT, and Delta-based CRDT. </p><p>There is another class of CRDTs: Merkle CRDTs.</p><p>Most ink spilled on CRDTs focuses on consistently merging data from different replicas. That's just half the story. Without a way of storing when concurrent edits happen, merges can't make consistent decisions about conflict resolution. </p><p>Normally, this is the job of <a href="https://haslab.wordpress.com/2011/07/08/version-vectors-are-not-vector-clocks/">version vectors</a> in State-based CRDTs and the log of causal operations in Op-based CRDTs. But if you're familiar with blockchains or Git, we notice that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle Trees and DAGs</a> (Directed Acyclical Graph) can also do the same job. </p><p>The following is how we construct this bookkeeping, exposed as an inherent structure of the concurrent state, rather than hidden away within a container. Let's look at the two variations:</p><ul><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00107.pdf">Merkle-DAG CRDTs</a></li><li><a href="https://inria.hal.science/hal-02303490v1/document">Merkle Search Tree CRDTs</a></li></ul><h2 id="merkle-dag-crdt">Merkle-DAG CRDT</h2><p>The Merkle-DAG (Directed Acyclical Graph) models CRDTs as a growing DAG of Merkle nodes about concurrent updates as events occur. This is a Merklized version of <a href="https://www.bartoszsypytkowski.com/operation-based-crdts-protocol/">Op-based CRDTs</a>, where the internal bookkeeping grows with the number of state updates, rather than with the number of replicas.</p><p>Each node in the Merkle-DAG can carry a payload of operations, state snapshots, or even deltas. This node payload must be a CRDT for the Merkle-DAG to be a CRDT. However, these payload CRDTs can be much simpler in their implementation because the bookkeeping on concurrent edits is delegated up to the Merkle-DAG.</p><p>It's as if a state-based CRDT was turned inside-out. The common bookkeeping elements are now the container (the DAG), and the payload-specific bookkeeping is inside of the payload CRDT.</p><p>Beyond simpler bookkeeping for payload CRDTs, Merkle-DAG CRDTs have an advantage that non-Merklized CRDTs don't.

It can be reconstructed and queried at any point in history. Immutability means diffs are easy, undos are easy, and provenance can be verified. But again, the downside here is a history of changes that grows with the number of events.

It does this by maintaining a few invariants. </p><ol><li>All the keys in a node are ordered.</li><li>All child nodes between two keys in a node contain entries lexicographically between the two keys.</li><li>The leaf layer is layer zero. The layer above is layer one, with increasing layer numbers until the root. The layer a key belongs to is dictated by the number of leading zeros in the hash of the key.</li><li>A node has a content ID that's a hash of all its keys concatenated with the content IDs of all its children. A child node is referenced by its content id.</li></ol><p>Keys live in all nodes of an MST tree, unlike a B-tree where keys are only at the leaves. This construction makes MSTs advantageous in two ways: it is self-balancing and it is unicit.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>A MST is self-balancing through both invariants #2 and #3. When a key is inserted in the tree, the layer is determined by the key's hash and the node in the layer is determined by the key's value. When the key is inserted in a node between two keys, it necessarily splits the child node between the two keys into two nodes due to invariant #2. Given a hash is in base <em>B</em> and invariant #3, the average number of keys in layer <em>L</em> is <em>B</em> times the average number of keys in layer <em>L + 1</em>. Hence, the average node size is <em>B</em>. Due to the placement of a key being completely deterministic, the tree self-balances.</p><p>Unicity means, for a given set of keys, the MST is unique. It implies the MST's construction does not depend on the order of the keys that were inserted. This is extremely desireable, because we can tell if two MSTs are different simply by comparing their root hashes regardless of the insertion order. If the root hash is the same, then the two trees are the same. </p><p>To construct a CRDT out of an MST, we simply add a payload to each key that's also a CRDT. Since the MST is an ordered set, merging sets have well-defined semantics, and merging the payloads is delegated to the payload itself to resolve. </p><p>And just like the Merkle-DAG construction, the payload CRDT doesn't need to be as complicated. For example, to construct a Grow-Only CRDT, we select the set { ⏊, ⏉ } (called "bottom" and "top" respectively) as the payload CRDT. All the values of the payload start as "bottom" by default. Merging means taking the max of "top" vs "bottom" (top always wins in a max operation). </p><p>Unfortunately, the paper leaves out the construction of other CRDTs using MSTs, as it was left as an exercise for the reader. However, there are two other possible constructions I think will work.</p><p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3380787.3393678">Causal Length CRDTs</a> for add-remove sets could be implemented in MSTs with ℤ (the set of integers) as the payload. If the number is even the key doesn't exist, and if it's odd, then it does. Merging would just be taking the max of the two replica's payloads.</p><p><a href="https://www.bartoszsypytkowski.com/operation-based-crdts-arrays-1/">Replicated Growable Arrays</a> (RGA) could be implemented by using virtual pointers concatted with the replica ID as the key. Since the MST keeps the keys ordered, we can read back the string by traversing in key order. This would need a mechanism outside of the MST to insert and assign tombstones for deletions. [^3]</p><p>Beyond that, there is an undetailed edge case. What if the key you're adding has a lot more (or a lot less) leading zeros in its hash than the number of leading zeros in the current root layer? Do you just add nodes in between the root and the new node? What should go in those in-between nodes? If there are no keys in these in-between nodes and just child content IDs, there would be no way to discern which child to descend into on a query. My guess is to simply insert a ghost key that doesn't exist in the set but only serves as a range bookend for queries. There are implementations to check out for details. [^4]</p><p>As for downsides, it's also vulnerable to attackers constructing a key with a large number of zeros and trying to insert it. That would result in a tall tree, reducing queries from O(log n) to O(n). And while the node size is on average <em>B</em>, the variance is spread pretty wide, so it can be common to have nodes that are too small or too large.</p><div><p>💡</p><p>- Merging of two Merkle Search Trees is done similarly to a Merkle Tree: by comparing hashes and walking down the tree.<br>- Node payload is a CRDT, and its merge function still needs to be commutative, associative, and idempotent.</p></div><div><p>👍</p><p>- Smaller amount of data sent over the network to sync by comparing hashes<br>- Sync protocol is simpler due to not needing causal order delivery, but still requires some chatter over the wire to find diff to send<br>- Self-balancing tree<br>- Trees are unicit<br>- Internal bookkeeping doesn't grow with either replicas or the number of updates</p></div><div><p>👎</p><p>- Possible for attackers to construct tall trees to slow query times<br>- Variance of node sizes is large</p></div><h2 id="the-surprising-connection">The surprising connection</h2><p>After this and the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/trade-offs-between-different-crdts/">previous survey</a> on CRDTs, I came away with some clarity on them. </p><p>CRDTs need two main ingredients to work, a merge/application operator that's commutative and associative, and some bookkeeping to keep track of concurrent or causal edits. This bookkeeping is like an uncollapsed superposition of state while the system isn't sure if there are any more concurrent edits. If we can be sure that all replicas are synced, we can either collapse the state or simply throw it away if we don't need to travel back in time.</p><p>For typical CRDTs, this bookkeeping is internal, and you're given an interface to set and query, so one can pretend this is a regular state that can be updated in place. Merkle CRDTs turn this inside out, exposing the inherent structure of concurrent edits and uncollapsed state for users to see and exploit.</p><p>This mirrors closely with how Git is structured. That surprised me at first. But as I dove into Git's history, I found this tidbit in passing.</p><blockquote>The important part of a merge is not how it handles conflicts (which need to be verified by a human anyway if they are at all interesting), but that it should meld the history together right so that you have a new solid base for future merges.<p>In other words, the important part is the _trivial_ part: the naming of the parents, and keeping track of their relationship. Not the clashes.<br><a href="https://wincent.com/blog/a-look-back-bram-cohen-vs-linus-torvalds">Linus Travolus vs Bram Cohen</a></p></blockquote><p>The values are the contents of the file, and the bookkeeping on concurrent edits happens outside of the value. What stops Git from being a CRDT is that its default 3-way merge isn't commutative and associative.</p><p>As history proved, it's the bookkeeping data structure that's important for merges, not the conflict resolution itself. But in the case of CRDTs, it's important to constrain the merge with algebraic properties [^2].</p><h2 id="the-search-continues">The search continues</h2><p>Merkle Search Trees have lots of nice properties, such as unicity, self-balancing, and a CRDT that doesn't grow with the number of replicas or events. But I think we can do better. For one, the variance of the node sizes is large in MSTs, which makes for uneven trees. </p><p>In my search, I found <a href="https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/blob/master/doc/intro.md#prolly-trees-probabilistic-b-trees">Prolly Trees</a>, and will take a look at them. If anyone has other suggestions for data structures to look at to implement composable CRDTs, <a href="https://twitter.com/iamwil">let me know</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Zeb Figura of CodeWeavers <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240124004028.16826-1-zfigura@codeweavers.com/" target="_blank">has proposed</a> a Windows NT synchronization primitive driver to help performance of running games and applications designed for Windows on Linux with Wine / Proton.</p>
<p>As per the RFC (request for comments) posted onto the Linux kernel mailing list&nbsp;Figura notes: "This patch series introduces a new char misc driver, /dev/ntsync, which is used to implement Windows NT synchronization primitives."</p>
<p>Then giving some background on it: "The Wine project emulates the Windows API in user space. One particular part of<br>
that API, namely the NT synchronization primitives, have historically been implemented via RPC to a dedicated "kernel" process. However, more recent applications use these APIs more strenuously, and the overhead of RPC has become a bottleneck.</p>
<p>The NT synchronization APIs are too complex to implement on top of existing primitives without sacrificing correctness. Certain operations, such as NtPulseEvent() or the "wait-for-all" mode of NtWaitForMultipleObjects(), require direct control over the underlying wait queue, and implementing a wait queue sufficiently robust for Wine in user space is not possible. This proposed driver, therefore, implements the problematic interfaces directly in the Linux kernel."</p>
<p>Figura did a presentation on it at the&nbsp;Linux Plumbers Conference in 2023 that you can see below:</p>

<p>What kind of performance difference might we see with something like this? The difference depends on your hardware and what you're trying to run but some FPS examples were given from multiple users including:</p>

<p><em>What hardware and software each was tested on was not noted.</em></p>
<p>Some impressive numbers but again it's hardware dependent, but even so any performance uplift would be welcome, so hopefully the patch series gets some good comments and approval after any tweaks are done that may be needed. Looks like we could end up seeing a nice future performance improvement for Linux and Steam Deck gaming with Wine and Proton.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft is laying off 1,900 employees at Activision Blizzard and Xbox this week. While Microsoft is primarily laying off roles at Activision Blizzard, some Xbox and ZeniMax employees will also be impacted by the cuts.</p><p>The cuts work out to roughly 8 percent of the overall Microsoft Gaming division that stands at around 22,000 employees in total. <em>The Verge</em> has obtained an internal memo from Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer that confirms the layoffs:</p><div><blockquote><p>It’s been a little over three months since the Activision, Blizzard, and King teams joined Microsoft. As we move forward in 2024, the leadership of Microsoft Gaming and Activision Blizzard is committed to aligning on a strategy and an execution plan with a sustainable cost structure that will support the whole of our growing business.&nbsp;Together, we’ve set priorities, identified areas of overlap, and ensured that we’re all aligned on the best opportunities for growth.</p><p>As part of this process,&nbsp;we have made the painful decision&nbsp;to reduce&nbsp;the size of our gaming workforce by approximately&nbsp;1900 roles out of the 22,000 people on our team.&nbsp;The Gaming Leadership Team and I are committed to navigating this process as thoughtfully as possible. The people who are directly impacted by these reductions have all played an important part in the success of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax and the Xbox teams, and they should be proud of everything they’ve accomplished here. We are grateful for all of the creativity, passion and dedication they have brought to our games, our players and our colleagues. We will provide our full support to those who are impacted during the transition, including severance benefits informed by local employment laws. Those whose roles will be impacted will be notified, and we ask that you please treat your departing colleagues with the respect and compassion that is consistent with our values.</p><p>Looking ahead, we’ll continue to invest in areas that will grow our business and support our strategy of bringing more games to more players around the world. Although this is a difficult moment for our team, I’m as confident as ever in your ability to create and nurture the games, stories and worlds that bring players together.</p><p>Phil</p></blockquote></div><p>Alongside the layoffs, Blizzard president Mike Ybarra has decided to leave the company. “As many of you know, Mike previously spent more than 20 years at&nbsp;Microsoft. Now that he has seen the acquisition through as Blizzard’s president, he has decided to leave the company,” says Microsoft’s game content and studios president, Matt Booty, in an internal memo.</p><p>Microsoft plans to name a new Blizzard president next week. Allen Adham, Blizzard’s chief design officer, is also leaving the company. “As one of Blizzard’s cofounders, Allen has had a broad impact on all of Blizzard’s games. His influence will be felt for years to come, both directly and indirectly as Allen plans to continue mentoring young designers across the industry,” says Booty.</p><p>Blizzard’s previously announced survival game has also been canceled as part of these changes. Booty says Microsoft will be “shifting some of the people working on it to one of several promising new projects Blizzard has in the early stages of development.”</p><p>The layoffs come the same month Riot Games, Google, Discord, Twitch, Unity, eBay, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/14/23458204/meta-twitter-amazon-apple-layoffs-hiring-freezes-latest-tech-industry">others announced cuts</a>.</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized">completed its $68.7 billion acquisition</a> of Activision Blizzard in October, following 20 months of battles with regulators in the UK and US.

Instead, a suite of Activision Blizzard executives now report up to Matt Booty.</p><p>Today’s layoffs come just a few months after some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23933049/microsoft-reorg-xbox-marketing-ai-leadership-changes">big Xbox leadership changes</a> saw Sarah Bond promoted to Xbox president, leading all Xbox platform and hardware work. Booty was also promoted to president of game content and studios, which includes overseeing Bethesda, ZeniMax studios, and Activision Blizzard.</p><p>Microsoft last announced big layoffs a year ago, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/18/23560315/microsoft-job-cuts-layoffs-2023-tech">affecting 10,000 employees</a>. The software maker is due to report its fiscal Q2 2024 earnings next week, which, for the first time, will include results from the impact of the Activision Blizzard acquisition.</p><p>Here’s Matt Booty’s internal memo in full:</p><div><blockquote><p>Blizzard team,&nbsp;</p><p>As you may have read in Phil’s note, today is a challenging day as we say goodbye to some of our colleagues. This is a difficult process, but it is one that will best enable Blizzard and Xbox to deliver ambitious games for our players on more platforms and in more places than ever before. We are moving forward with a more focused strategy across Microsoft Gaming that sets us up for sustainable growth and aligns our talent and resources to our top priorities.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the events today, Mike Ybarra and I have been discussing his future and some of his personal passions for some time. As many of you know, Mike previously spent more than 20 years at Microsoft. Now that he has seen the acquisition through as Blizzard’s president, he has decided to leave the company. As we move forward, we will continue to build on the positive momentum that Mike created and strive to continue exceeding the expectations of Blizzard’s players. I want to thank Mike for his leadership and for his partnership and counsel since the deal closed. I know he plans to travel and spend more time with his family. We wish him the very best.</p><p>Additionally, Allen Adham, Blizzard’s Chief Design Officer, is leaving the company. As one of Blizzard’s cofounders, Allen has had a broad impact on all of Blizzard’s games. His influence will be felt for years to come, both directly and indirectly as Allen plans to continue mentoring young designers across the industry.</p><p>The new Blizzard President will be announced next week.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What Happens Next</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Those who are impacted are being informed in meetings starting today. Given the challenging day ahead, anyone who is set up to work from home and would prefer to, can work remotely today. Due to time zones and local holidays, some impacted employees in APAC and EMEA will be informed later this evening and into early next week. After the notifications are complete, leaders will bring their teams together. Please be mindful of this process in your conversations and outreach during these next few days.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Details on Today’s Actions</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The changes announced today reflect a focus on products and strategies that hold the most promise for Blizzard’s future growth, as well as identified areas of overlap across Blizzard and Microsoft Gaming. Today’s actions affect multiple teams within Blizzard, including development teams, shared service organizations and corporate functions. As part of this focus, Blizzard is ending development on its survival game project and will be shifting some of the people working on it to one of several promising new projects Blizzard has in the early stages of development.&nbsp;</p><p>No matter the reason behind these decisions, they are never made lightly. Changes like these affect the lives of colleagues and friends, and we are all grateful for their meaningful contributions to Blizzard and its world class lineup of games. As Phil stated, we will provide our full support to those who are impacted during the transition, including severance benefits informed by local employment laws.&nbsp;</p><p>I understand that this is a challenging time and that it can be a lot to process.

		<p><em>By William Woodruff</em></p>
<p>For the past eight months, Trail of Bits has worked with the <a href="https://github.com/pyca">Python Cryptographic Authority</a> to build <a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/tree/main/src/rust/cryptography-x509-verification">cryptography-x509-verification</a>, a brand-new, pure-Rust implementation of the X.509 path validation algorithm that TLS and other encryption and authentication protocols are built on. Our implementation is fast, standards-conforming, and memory-safe, giving the Python ecosystem a modern alternative to OpenSSL’s <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/12/22/catching-openssl-misuse-using-codeql/">misuse-</a> and <a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html">vulnerability-prone</a> X.509 APIs for HTTPS certificate verification, among other protocols. This is a foundational security improvement that will benefit every Python network programmer and, consequently, the internet as a whole.</p>
<p>Our implementation has been <a href="https://cryptography.io/en/latest/x509/verification/">exposed as a Python API</a> and is included in <a href="https://cryptography.io/en/latest/changelog/#v42-0-0">Cryptography’s 42.0.0 release series</a>, meaning that Python developers can take advantage of it today! Here’s an example usage, demonstrating its interaction with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/certifi/">certifi</a> as a root CA bundle:</p>

<p>As part of our design we also developed <a href="https://x509-limbo.com/">x509-limbo</a>, a test vector and harness suite for evaluating the standards conformance and consistent behavior of various X.509 path validation implementations. x509-limbo is permissively licensed and reusable, and has already <a href="https://x509-limbo.com/anomalous-results/rust-webpki/">found</a> <a href="https://x509-limbo.com/anomalous-results/openssl-3.0.2/">validation</a> <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/65085">differentials</a> across Go’s <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/x509">crypto/x509</a>, <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>, and <a href="https://docs.rs/rustls-webpki/latest/webpki/">two</a> <a href="https://docs.rs/webpki/latest/webpki/">popular</a> pre-existing Rust X.509 validators.</p>
<h3>X.509 path validation</h3>
<p>X.509 and path validation are both too expansive to reasonably summarize in a single post. Instead, we’ll grossly oversimplify X.509 to two basic facts:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509"><span>X.509</span></a><span> is a </span><i><span>certificate</span></i><span> format: it binds a </span><i><span>public key</span></i><span> and some metadata for that key (what it can be used for, the </span><i><span>subject</span></i><span> it identifies) to a </span><i><span>signature</span></i><span>, which is produced by a private key. The </span><i><span>subject</span></i><span> of a certificate can be a domain name, or some other relevant identifier.</span></li>
<li><i><span>Verifying</span></i><span> an X.509 certificate entails </span><i><span>obtaining</span></i><span> the public key for its signature, using that public key to check the signature, and (finally) validating the associated metadata against a set of validity rules (sometimes called an X.509 profile). In the context of the public web, there are two profiles that matter: </span><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280"><span>RFC 5280</span></a><span> and the </span><a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements/"><span>CA/B Forum Baseline Requirements</span></a><span> (“CABF BRs”).</span></li>
</ol>
<p>These two facts make X.509 certificates chainable: an X.509 certificate’s signature can be verified by finding the parent certificate containing the appropriate public key; the parent, in turn, has its own parent. This chain building process continues until an a priori trusted certificate is encountered, typically because of trust asserted in the host OS itself (which maintains a pre-configured set of trusted certificates).</p>
<p>Chain building (also called “path validation”) is the cornerstone of TLS’s authentication guarantees: it allows a web server (like <a href="http://x509-limbo.com/">x509-limbo.com</a>) to serve an untrusted “leaf” certificate along with zero or more untrusted parents (called intermediates), which must ultimately chain to a root certificate that the connecting client already knows and trusts.</p>
<p>As a visualization, here is a valid certificate chain for <a href="http://x509-limbo.com/">x509-limbo.com</a>, with arrows representing the “signed by” relationship:</p>

<p>In this scenario, <a href="http://x509-limbo.com/">x509-limbo.com</a> serves us two initially untrusted certificates: the leaf certificate for <a href="http://x509-limbo.com/">x509-limbo.com</a> itself, along with an intermediate (Let’s Encrypt R3) that signs for the leaf.</p>
<p>The intermediate in turn is signed for by a root certificate (ISRG Root X1) that’s already trusted (by virtue of being in our OS or runtime trust store), giving us confidence in the complete chain, and thus the leaf’s public key for the purposes of TLS session initiation.</p>
<h3>What can go wrong?</h3>
<p>The above explanation of X.509 and path validation paints a bucolic picture: to build the chain, we simply iterate through our parent candidates at each step, terminating on success once we reach a root of trust or with failure upon exhausting all candidates. Simple, right?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the reality is far messier:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>The abstraction above (“one certificate, one public key”) is a </span><b>gross oversimplification</b><span>. In reality, a single public key (corresponding to a single “logical” issuing authority) may have multiple “physical” certificates, for cross-issuance purposes.</span></li>
<li><span>Because the trusted set is defined by the host OS or language runtime, </span><b>there is no “one true” chain</b><span> for a given leaf certificate. In reality, most </span><span>(leaf, [intermediates])</span><span> tuples have several candidate solutions, of which </span><i><span>any</span></i><span> is a valid chain.</span>
<ul>
<li><span>This is the “why” for the first bullet: a web server can’t guarantee that any particular client has any particular set of trusted roots, so intermediate issuers typically have multiple certificates for a single public key to maximize the likelihood of a successfully built chain.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Not all certificates are made equal: certificates (including different “physical” certificates for the same “logical” issuing authority) can contain constraints that prevent otherwise valid paths: </span><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.10"><span>name restrictions</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.9"><span>overall length restrictions</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.12"><span>usage restrictions</span></a><span>, and so forth. In other words, a correct path building implementation </span><b>must be able to backtrack</b><span> after encountering a constraint that eliminates the current candidate chain.</span></li>
<li><span>The X.509 profile </span><i><span>itself</span></i><span> can impose constraints on both the overall chain and its constituent members: the CABF BRs, for example, forbid known-weak signature algorithms and public key types, and many path validation libraries additionally allow users to constrain valid chain constructions below a configurable maximum length.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, these (non-exhaustive) complications mean that our simple recursive linear scan for chain building is really a depth-first graph search with both static and dynamic constraints. Failing to treat it as such has catastrophic consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Failing to implement a dynamic search typically results in </span><b>overly conservative</b><span> chain constructions, sometimes with Internet-breaking outcomes. OpenSSL 1.0.x’s inability to build the “</span><a href="https://medium.com/@sleevi_/path-building-vs-path-verifying-the-chain-of-pain-9fbab861d7d6"><span>chain of pain</span></a><span>” in 2020 is one recent example of this.</span></li>
<li><span>Failing to honor the interior constraints and profile-wide certificate requirements can result in </span><b>overly permissive</b><span> chain constructions. </span><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-3450"><span>CVE-2021-3450</span></a><span> is one recent example of this, causing some configurations of OpenSSL 1.1.x to accept chains built with non-CA certificates.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Consequently, building both correct and maximal (in the sense of finding any valid chain) X.509 path validator is of the utmost importance, both for availability and security.</p>
<h3>Quirks, surprises, and ambiguities</h3>
<p>Despite underpinning the Web PKI and other critical pieces of Internet infrastructure, there are relatively few independent implementations of X.509 path validation: most platforms and languages reuse one of a small handful of common implementations (OpenSSL and its forks, <a href="https://github.com/nss-dev/nss">NSS</a>, Go’s <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/x509">crypto/x509</a>, GnuTLS, etc.) or the host OS’s implementation (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/cryptoapi-system-architecture">CryptoAPI</a> on Windows, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security">Security</a> on macOS). This manifests as a few recurring quirks and ambiguities:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>A lack of implementation diversity means that mistakes and design decisions (such as overly or insufficiently conservative profile checks) leak into other implementations: users complain when a PKI deployment that was only tested on OpenSSL fails to work against crypto/x509, so implementations frequently bend their specification adherence to accommodate real-world certificates.</span></li>
<li><span>The specifications often mandate surprising behavior that (virtually) no client implements correctly. RFC 5280, for example, stipulates that path length and name constraints do not apply to self-issued intermediates, but this is </span><a href="https://x509-limbo.com/testcases/pathlen/#pathlenself-issued-certs-pathlen"><span>widely</span></a> <a href="https://x509-limbo.com/testcases/rfc5280/#rfc5280ncpermitted-self-issued"><span>ignored</span></a><span> in practice.</span></li>
<li><span>Because the specifications themselves are so infrequently interpreted, they contain still-unresolved ambiguities: treating roots as “trust anchors” versus policy-bearing certificates, </span><a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/33310"><span>handling of serial numbers that are 20 bytes long but DER-encoded with 21 bytes</span></a><span>, and so forth.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Our implementation needed to handle each of these families of quirks. To do so consistently, we leaned on three basic strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><i><span>Test first, then implement</span></i><span>: To give ourselves confidence in our designs, we built x509-limbo and pre-validated it against other implementations. This gave us both a coverage baseline for our own implementation, </span><i><span>and</span></i><span> empirical justification for relaxing various policy-level checks, where necessary.</span></li>
<li><i><span>Keep everything in Rust:</span></i><span> Rust’s performance, strong type system and safety properties meant that we could make rapid iterations to our design while focusing on algorithmic correctness rather than memory safety. It certainly didn’t hurt that PyCA Cryptography’s X.509 parsing is </span><a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/tree/main/src/rust/cryptography-x509"><span>already done in Rust</span></a><span>, of course.</span></li>
<li><i><span>Obey </span></i><a href="https://medium.com/@sleevi_/path-building-vs-path-verifying-the-chain-of-pain-9fbab861d7d6"><i><span>Sleevi’s Laws</span></i></a><i><span>: </span></i><span>Our implementation treats path construction and path validation as a single unified step with no “one” true chain, meaning that the </span><i><span>entire</span></i><span> graph is always searched before giving up and returning a failure to the user.</span></li>
<li><i><span>Compromise where necessary:</span></i><span> As mentioned above, implementations frequently maintain compatibility with OpenSSL, even where doing so violates the profiles defined in RFC 5280 and the CABF BRs. This situation has improved dramatically over the years (and improvements have accelerated in pace, as certificate issuance periods have shortened on the Web PKI), but some compromises are still necessary.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Looking forward</h3>
<p>Our initial implementation is production-ready, and comes in at around 2,500 lines of Rust, not counting the relatively small Python-only API surfaces or x509-limbo:<br>

From here, there’s much that could be done. Some ideas we have include:</p>
<ul>
<li><i><span>Expose APIs for client certificate path validation.</span></i><span> To expedite things, we’ve focused the initial implementation on server validation (verifying that a leaf certificate attesting to a specific DNS name or IP address chains up to a root of trust). This ignores </span><i><span>client validation</span></i><span>, wherein the client side of a connection presents its own certificate for the server to verify against a set of known principals. Client path validation shares the same fundamental chain building algorithm as server validation, but has a slightly different ideal public API (since the client’s identity needs to be matched against a potentially arbitrary number of identities known to the server).</span></li>
<li><i><span>Expose different X.509 profiles (and more configuration knobs).</span></i><span> The current APIs expose very little configuration; the only things a user of the Python API can change are the certificate subject, the validation time, and the maximum chain depth. Going forward, we’ll look into exposing additional knobs, including pieces of state that will allow users to perform verifications with the RFC 5280 certificate profile and other common profiles (like Microsoft’s Authenticode profile). Long term, this will help bespoke (such as corporate) PKI use cases to migrate to Cryptography’s X.509 APIs and lessen their dependency on OpenSSL.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation"><i><span>Carcinize</span></i></a><i><span> existing C and C++ X.509 users</span></i><span>. One of Rust’s greatest strengths is its native, zero-cost compatibility with C and C++. Given that C and C++ implementations of X.509 and path validation have historically been significant sources of exploitable memory corruption bugs, we believe that a thin “native” wrapper around </span><span>cryptography-x509-verification</span><span> could have an outsized positive impact on the security of major C and C++ codebases.</span></li>
<li><i><span>Spread the gospel of x509-limbo.</span></i><span> x509-limbo was an instrumental component in our ability to confidently ship an X.509 path validator. We’ve written it in such a way that should make integration into other path validation implementations as simple as downloading and consuming </span><a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/x509-limbo/blob/main/limbo.json"><span>a single JSON file</span></a><span>. We look forward to helping other implementations (such as </span><a href="https://github.com/rustls/webpki/issues/206"><span>rustls-webpki</span></a><span>) integrate it directly into their own testing regimens!</span></li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-430723">


<h3>from the <i>hollowed-out-and-sold-for-parts</i> dept</h3>

<p>When we last checked in with what’s left of Sports Illustrated, its owner, The Arena Group, had just got done baring its ass as part of a giant <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/11/29/sports-illustrated-the-latest-to-bare-its-entire-ass-thanks-to-laziness-greed-and-half-cooked-ai/">‘AI’ related scandal</a>. Company executives apparently thought it would be a great idea to create a bunch of fake, AI-generated writers to shit out lazy, uninteresting clickbait, without really telling any of the folks that create actual journalism at the company.</p>
<p>When busted, Arena Group executives blamed everyone but themselves. </p>
<p>Sports Illustrated’s fortunes got even bleaker last week, when it was revealed that The Arena Group, which had actually <strong>only been renting the Sports Illustrated brand</strong> as part of a 10-year deal with Authentic Brands Group (ABG), had <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/01/sports-illustrated-brand-publisher-restructuring-1235696747/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed to make a quarterly $3.75 million</a> payment to continue licensing it. That resulted in a revocation of the branding license and no limit of additional chaos for the already imploding company.</p>
<p>To <a href="https://awfulannouncing.com/si/jamie-salter-manoj-bhargava-abg-arena-sports-illustrated.html">hear ABG CEO Jamie Salter tell it</a>, Arena Group tried to change the terms of the licensing deal and lower its payments mid-stride. Salter says they may still be able to strike a deal with Arena, or they may find another renter. But when it comes to sports reporting and Sports Illustrated, it doesn’t really matter at this point — as the brand has already largely become a zombie of its former self. </p>
<p>And, as is usually the case, employees doing the actual work were the ones who <a href="https://defector.com/sports-illustrated-as-we-know-it-appears-to-be-dead">got to pay the price for their employers’ incompetence</a> and bickering, with large swaths informed of layoffs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Earlier today, The Arena Group gave notice over email that it would be conducting layoffs at&nbsp;Sports Illustrated.&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/si_union/status/1748390846058176659" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A statement from the&nbsp;Sports Illustrated&nbsp;union</a>&nbsp;revealed that “a significant number, possibly all” of the magazine’s staff would be losing their jobs as the result of Authentic Brands Group’s decision to revoke The Arena Group’s license to the&nbsp;SI&nbsp;brand.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the past six years Sports Illustrated has been tossed around between a rotating crop of dodgy international middlemen for whom journalism was an afterthought. SI was acquired in 2018 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotdash_Meredith#:~:text=On%20October%206%2C%202021%2C%20Dotdash,new%20entity%20called%20Dotdash%20Meredith.">what was left</a> of Meredith Publishing as part of a purchase of what was left of Time, Inc. (which founded the magazine in 1954), then had its intellectual property sold to Authentic for $110 million a year later. </p>
<p>All the while, the output and quality of the end product and brand steadily declined, resulting in a media outlet that’s now more interested in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/7F3704AF-8F81-472D-9CDE-4D543395482D">hawking supplements</a> and affixing its brand to casino deals than doing any sort of cogent sports reporting. It’s a not dissimilar trajectory to other major media brands like Newsweek, which was <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/158968/newsweek-rise-zombie-magazine">hollowed out like a pumpkin and now traffics in right wing conspiracy theories</a>. </p>
<p>Sports Illustrated’s decline runs in parallel to the ongoing, continuing collapse of real journalism and the whole <em>accurately informing the public</em> thing–which has never been much of a money maker. There were a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2023/12/19/media-companies-have-slashed-over-20000-jobs-in-2023/?sh=b6b29c022b78">record number of media layoffs last year,</a> as trust fund brunchlords and the incompetent stewards of a dying press hustle and jockey to make a quick buck shuffling bloated brand corpses around.</p>
<p>It’s more profitable to make a quick buck striking acquisition deals and pointless mergers for the tax breaks — generating automated clickbait and bullshit at historic scale and using what’s left of popular brands to sell junk — than it is to pay real reporters a living wage to create quality journalism. The end result of that lazy mindset is everywhere you look. And it seems to be getting worse.</p>
<p>Despite a lot of lip service, we’ve <em>never really spent a whole lot of time actually trying to find creative new funding options for real journalism</em> at any meaningful scale. Certainly nowhere near the time and effort put into get rich quick tech fads like NFTs. The stewards of what’s left have no interest in real journalism, or funding it. They’re in it to make a quick buck off the fading remnants of a dying industry, cutting corners, firing employees, and pursuing easy money wherever possible.</p>
<p>As a result journalism — sports or otherwise — is steadily being replaced by a parade of automated gibberish, clickbait, <a href="https://www.damemagazine.com/2023/03/06/america-propaganda-disinformation/">well-funded propaganda</a>, and marketing, and it’s getting increasingly difficult to find anybody with the ethics and resources interested in reversing — or even combating — the trajectory. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>EFF has joined forces with 110 NGOs today in a <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2024/01/22/joint.advocacy.statement-cybercrime.convention-jan.23.2024.pdf">joint statement</a></span><span> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/01/joint-statement-proposed-cybercrime-treaty-ahead-concluding-session">delivered to the United Nations</a> Ad Hoc Committee, clearly outlining civil society&nbsp;non-negotiable redlines for the </span><a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/Cybercrime/AdHocCommittee/Concluding_session/Documents/A_AC.291_22_Rev.1_E.pdf"><span>proposed UN Cybercrime Treaty</span></a><span>, and asserting that states should reject the proposed treaty if these essential changes are not implemented.&nbsp;</span><br><span></span></p>
<p><span>The last draft published on November 6, 2023 does not adequately ensure adherence to human rights law and standards. Initially focused on cybercrime, the proposed Treaty <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/cybersecurity/opinion/un-cybercrime-treaty-a-menace-in-the-making/">has alarmingly evolved</a> into an expansive surveillance tool.</span></p>
<p><span>Katitza Rodriguez, EFF Policy Director for Global Privacy,&nbsp;asserts ahead of the upcoming concluding negotiations:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>The proposed treaty needs more than just minor adjustments; it requires a more focused, narrowly defined approach to tackle cybercrime. This change is essential to prevent the treaty from becoming a global surveillance pact rather than a tool for effectively combating core cybercrimes. With its wide-reaching scope and invasive surveillance powers, the current version raises serious concerns about cross-border repression and potential police overreach. Above all, human rights must be the treaty's cornerstone, not an afterthought. If states can't unite on these key points, they must outright reject the treaty.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Historically, cybercrime legislation has been exploited to target journalists and security researchers, suppress dissent and whistleblowers, endanger human rights defenders, limit free expression, and justify unnecessary and disproportionate state surveillance measures. We are concerned that the proposed Treaty, as it stands now, will exacerbate these problems. The proposed treaty <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/cybercrime/ad_hoc_committee/ahc_concluding_session/main">concluding session</a> will be held at the UN Headquarters in New York from January 29 to February 10th. EFF will be attending in person.</span></p>
<p><span>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/01/joint-statement-proposed-cybercrime-treaty-ahead-concluding-session">joint statement</a> specifically calls States to narrow the scope of criminalization provisions to well defined cyber dependent crimes; shield security researchers, whistleblowers, activists, and journalists from being&nbsp;prosecuted for their legitimate activities; explicitly include language on international human rights law, data protection, and gender mainstreaming; limit the scope of the domestic criminal procedural measures and international cooperation to core cybercrimes established in the criminalization chapter; and address concerns that the current draft could weaken cybersecurity and encryption. Additionally, it requires the necessity to establish specific safeguards, such as the principles of prior judicial authorization, necessity, legitimate aim, and proportionality. </span></p>

<p>In the aftermath of <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2237527/epic-games-selling-bandcamp-a-year-after-acquiring-it/news/">Epic selling Bandcamp to Songtradr</a>, Bandcamp has found itself in a place of instability. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23919551/bandcamp-layoffs-epic-songtradr">Half of the company’s employees were laid off</a> post-acquisition, leading many to speculate over the beloved platform’s future. Most importantly, many artists who depended on the service are left looking for alternatives.</p>



<p>There isn’t a Fediverse solution yet. Although <a href="https://funkwhale.audio/">Funkwhale</a> is a great music platform, it’s just not geared towards selling music. Not all is lost, however, as the <a href="https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Faircamp</a> project is stepping in to help musicians.</p>

<p>Faircamp bills itself as “a static site generator for audio producers”, but an easier way to understand it is this: it’s a simple site that you can host yourself. Install some software on your server, point it at the folder of the music you want to sell, and your site’s pages will build themselves. You can find a great guide for getting started <a href="https://www.meljoann.com/posts/faircamp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>Faircamp offers a high degree of customization, all while looking good doing it. Artists are able to set up payment for albums and tracks, offer freebies, unlock codes, and embed a player in other sites. It looks great on mobile, too.</p>





<p>So far, the music community has responded to Faircamp very positively. Many musicians within the Fediverse have actively made an effort to form <a href="https://webring.key13.uk/">an old-school webring</a>, in the hopes of supporting one another.</p>

<p>All in all, Faircamp looks like it’s shaping up to be a great alternative method for supporting Fediverse musicians! Hopefully this effort brings renewed interest towards building federated tools for creatives on the network, somewhere down the road.</p>

    </div><p>Japan's space agency said Thursday that its first lunar mission hit the tiny patch of the moon's surface it was aiming for, in a successful demonstration of its pinpoint landing system—although the probe appears to be lying upside-down.</p>


										      
																																	<p>Japan became the fifth country in history to reach the moon when the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon, or SLIM, touched down on the moon early on Saturday. But trouble with the probe's solar batteries made it hard at first to figure out whether the probe landed in the target zone.</p>
<p>While most previous probes have used landing zones about 10 kilometers (six miles) wide, SLIM was aiming at a target of just 100 meters (330 feet). Improved accuracy would give scientists access to more of the moon, since probes could be placed nearer to obstacles.</p>
<p>One of the lander's main engines lost thrust about 50 meters (54 yards) above the moon surface, causing a harder landing than planned.</p>
<p>A pair of autonomous probes released by SLIM before touchtown sent back images of the box-shaped vehicle on the surface, although it appeared to be upside down.</p>
<p>After a few days of data analysis, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA determined that the spacecraft landed about 55 meters (60 yards) away from its target, in between two craters near the Shioli crater, a region covered in volcanic rock.</p>

<div data-thumb="https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/tmb/2024/japans-precision-moon-1.jpg" data-src="https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/japans-precision-moon-1.jpg" data-sub-html="Journalists watch an image taken by Lunar Excursion Vehicle 2 (LEV-2) from the moon during a press conference on updates on the status of its spacecraft, including whether it successfully made a &amp;quot;pinpoint landing&amp;quot; on the Moon Thursday, Jan. 25, 2024, in Tokyo.

<p>But after the landing mishap, the craft's solar panels wound up facing the wrong direction, and it cannot generate power. Officials said there is still hope the probe will be able to recharge when the moon enters its daytime in the coming days.</p>
<p>JAXA project manager Shinichiro Sakai said the images sent back were just like those he'd imagined and seen in computer renderings.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>"Something we designed traveled all the way to the moon and took that snapshot. I almost fell down when I saw it," he said. For the pinpoint landing, Sakai said, he would give SLIM a "perfect score."</p>
<p>"We demonstrated that we can land where we want," Sakai said. "We opened a door to a new era."</p>
<p>LEV-1, a hopping robot equipped with an antenna and a camera, was tasked with recording SLIM's landing and transmitting images back to Earth. LEV-2 is a baseball-sized rover equipped with two cameras, developed by JAXA together with Sony, toymaker Tomy Co. and Doshisha University.</p>

<p>The two autonomous probes frame and select images independently, both using LEV-1's antenna to send them back to the base.</p>
<p>Daichi Hirano, a JAXA scientist who designed LEV-2, also known as Sora-Q, said it selected images containing SLIM and nearby lunar surface and transmitted the images through LEV-1, making the pair the world's first to achieve the mission. Despite the rush, the probes captured and transmitted 275 images.</p>
<p>Japan followed the United States, the Soviet Union, China and India to reach the moon's surface.</p>
<p>The project was the fruit of two decades of work on precision technology by JAXA.</p>
<p>JAXA has a track record with difficult landings. Its Hayabusa2 spacecraft, launched in 2014, touched down twice on the 900-meter-long (3,000-foot-long) asteroid Ryugu, collecting samples that were returned to Earth.</p>

<p>SLIM, nicknamed "the Moon Sniper," was intended to seek clues about the origin of the moon, including analyzing minerals with a special camera.</p>
<p>SLIM was launched on a Mitsubishi Heavy H2A rocket in September. It initially orbited Earth and entered lunar orbit on Dec. 25.</p>
<p>Japan hopes to regain confidence for its space technology after a number of failures. A spacecraft designed by a Japanese company crashed during a lunar landing attempt in April, and a new flagship rocket failed its debut launch in March.</p>

<p>Just over a year ago there was a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33983088">discussion</a> on Hacker News about the IBM ThinkPad 701c (the one with the lovely folding "butterfly" keyboard). In particular, it was a discussion about the incredible web site <a href="http://701c.org/">701c.org</a> which gives very, very detailed instructions on how to dismantle, restore and preserve those lovely machines.</p><p>In the discussion a chap <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34002977">said</a>: "<i>I have two in non-working condition, pretty beat up. If I can make someone really happy and they want to restore them, feel free to send me an email. I wanted to do it myself for the last 10 years it so but realistically know I won’t. I’m based in NL.</i>" And I figured, he's not too far from me, maybe I could get them and create one restored machine from them.</p><p>A year later my fully restored (and memory upgraded!) IBM ThinkPad 701c is finished.

Via a very slow process of using 90% isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and a sharp tool and a toothbrush all that material was removed and with a multimeter I was able to verify that all the connections were good and there were no shorts.</p><p>In the end the terminals ended up looking something like this:</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhTtxJW-Yic6pAZ_x-6DIZn4BW4TQioyLjIeiLz5x8jDNFT290Qac5hn8KK2nQqnRWzZ6LnqMSH5gcFODuKQVJesUOMs9osc3uIGL4TDjJAJHXezpOlSx6k5uyNQjxhKvomd-zQ-VyCyofDQyn0YMO2SdKYRvcsT9H4v6JjuUITLG46xU4o-hl5FQ/s4032/701c-13.jpg"><img data-original-height="4032" data-original-width="3024" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhTtxJW-Yic6pAZ_x-6DIZn4BW4TQioyLjIeiLz5x8jDNFT290Qac5hn8KK2nQqnRWzZ6LnqMSH5gcFODuKQVJesUOMs9osc3uIGL4TDjJAJHXezpOlSx6k5uyNQjxhKvomd-zQ-VyCyofDQyn0YMO2SdKYRvcsT9H4v6JjuUITLG46xU4o-hl5FQ/w480-h640/701c-13.jpg" width="480"></a></p><p>You can see how the metal has been damaged but luckily the connectors are still intact. I also washed all the circuit boards with 90% IPA and replaced the old Kapton tape. Since I was going to end up building a frankenmachine I stuck coloured stickers on parts.

In this work, we investigate how Wi-Fi access points manage the security context of queued frames. By exploiting power-save features, we show how to trick access points into leaking frames in plaintext, or encrypted using the group or an all-zero key. We demonstrate resulting attacks against several open-source network stacks. We attribute our findings to the lack of explicit guidance in managing security contexts of buffered frames in the 802.11 standards. The unprotected nature of the power-save bit in a frame’s header, which our work reveals to be a fundamental design flaw, also allows an adversary to force queue frames intended for a specific client resulting in its disconnection and trivially executing a denial-of-service attack. Furthermore, we demonstrate how an attacker can override and control the security context of frames that are yet to be queued. This exploits a design flaw in hotspot-like networks and allows the attacker to force an access points to encrypt yet to be queued frames using an adversary-chosen key, thereby bypassing Wi-Fi encryption entirely. Our attacks have a widespread impact as they affect various devices and operating systems (Linux, FreeBSD, iOS, and Android) and because they can be used to hijack TCP connections or intercept client and web traffic. Overall, we highlight the need for transparency in handling security context across the network stack layers and the challenges in doing so.</p></div></div><div id="node-paper-full-group-open-access-content"><h2><span>Open Access Media</span></h2><p>USENIX is committed to Open Access to the research presented at our events.
