<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About</h2>
<p dir="auto">Unfortunately, in recent months news have come up saying VanMoof isn‚Äôt in a very good financial state and had to be rescued in December 2022 by a number of unnamed investors, <a href="https://archive.ph/ivRfD" rel="nofollow">source</a>. Also, at the time of writing this README, end of June 2023, VanMoof has halted all sales.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Bluetooth connection between your smartphone and your VanMoof is encrypted for security purposes. Each time you log into your VanMoof account, this encryption key is being downloaded from VanMoof‚Äôs server. If these servers will go offline one day - for whatever reason - the encryption keys are lost forever and you have no way of communicating with your bike.</p>
<p dir="auto">With this tool, we want to make sure everyone can use their VanMoof even after these servers become unreachable - preventing e-waste.</p>
<p dir="auto">We encourage self hosting this tool, however, if you do not have the technical resources, you can use the version hosted on our server at <a href="https://vanoof.grossartig.io/" rel="nofollow">vanoof.grossartig.io</a></p>
<p dir="auto">vanoof.grossartig.io does not store any personal data. Our server acts as a proxy to VanMoof's API as it only allows Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * headers.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <header>

  <p>Between Reddit, twitter, LinkedIn and various Slack communities, I see multiple junior folk looking to break into Data Engineering and asking for advice. Every single day. Many ask for a ‚Äúroadmap‚Äù or some kind of step by step lesson plan that will land them their dream job. I don‚Äôt believe that such a roadmap exists.</p>
<h2 id="newbies-are-welcome">Newbies are welcome üëã</h2>
<p>I have seen some say ‚ÄúData Engineering is not an entry level role‚Äù and this is nothing more than toxic gatekeeping. Data Engineering is no more, and no less, complex than any other software discipline. Every discipline is open to newbies. If you want to get into data, you can do it. You don‚Äôt <em>need</em> to ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù into it from a different discipline.</p>
<p>Moving sideways into Data Engineering is very common, not because it‚Äôs necessary, but because Data Engineering is relatively new as a somewhat well-defined job category. Data Engineering teams haven‚Äôt been commonplace for long, in fact, there‚Äôs many industries still just starting to catch on. Many Data Analysts and Software Engineers already have at least <em>some</em> level of hands-on experience with data, so it makes total sense to use &amp; develop those skills. This has happened with every single kind of engineering role in the history of engineering. But there‚Äôs only so many people who want to make the switch, and you can‚Äôt reallocate <em>everyone</em> from your other teams. So, Data Engineering absolutely needs entry-level engineers.</p>
<p>People used to say ‚ÄúSoftware Engineering is not an entry level role‚Äù. They don‚Äôt anymore, because people know it is total rubbish.</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome in data.</p>
<h2 id="all-you-need-is-love-sql-Ô∏è">All you need is <del>love</del> SQL ‚ù§Ô∏è</h2>
<p>So, how does an entry-level engineer get started in Data Engineering?</p>
<p>Firstly, go unfollow all those influencers on LinkedIn and Twitter. You don‚Äôt need them, in fact, they are dangerous. They‚Äôre not here to guide, help or teach you. They will take you down a path of failure so that you are more open to giving them your money for a quick win (<a href="#%F0%9F%8C%B6%EF%B8%8F-a-quick-rant-%F0%9F%8C%B6%EF%B8%8F">rant</a>).</p>
<p>With that out the way, understand that there is no roadmap. There is no single path, no clear linear progression of knowledge. No one can tell you that you absolutely must learn A, then B, then C and you‚Äôre guaranteed to be a successful Data Engineer.</p>
<p>The same applies to pretty much all engineering roles; front end, back end, embedded systems, networking, analytics. Whatever.</p>
<p>In all of these cases, there are basics that <em>everyone</em> should get familiar with, and these are usually enough to get you your first gig. Remember, there is a fundamental difference between ‚ÄúWhat do I need to get my first job?‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow do I progress my career?‚Äú.</p>
<p>For Data Engineering, there is only one skill that is absolutely, non-negotiably, the first thing you should learn to get started.</p>
<p><strong>SQL.</strong></p>
<p>Yep, SQL. It‚Äôs not dead. It never will be. SQL is the cockroach of data and it‚Äôs not going anywhere. People have tried to displace it, and they have all failed.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://www.alasdairb.com/_astro/quote.b861bda1_SP6yT.webp" width="850" height="400" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>SQL is the only skill that every single Data Engineer uses every single day. No other skill or tool can claim the same. Python is common, some folks are using Scala, Snowflake is popular‚Ä¶but there‚Äôs more data teams <em>not</em> using those tools than those who <em>are</em>. But not for SQL.</p>
<p>You‚Äôre an entry level engineer, you don‚Äôt need to be an expert in SQL. You need to be able to solve problems. When you write some shit SQL, and you absolutely will, one of two things will happen:</p>
<p>Thing 1, someone will tell you it‚Äôs shit and you‚Äôll learn how to do it better.</p>
<p>Thing 2, people will thank you for solving the problem and ask you to do something else.</p>
<p>Win win.</p>
<h2 id="how-should-i-learn-sql">How should I learn SQL?</h2>
<p>If you‚Äôre new to SQL and databases, you should know that ‚ÄúSQL‚Äù is very poorly standardised. You‚Äôll hear folks say ‚ÄúANSI SQL‚Äù which many think is some kind of standard, but it‚Äôs not really. Anyway, if that topic interests you, <a href="https://blog.ansi.org/sql-standard-iso-iec-9075-2023-ansi-x3-135/">read up on it</a>. There is a common SQL base, but pretty much every single database in existence customises and extends SQL to do whatever it wants.</p>
<p>This means that SQL you write for Postgres <em>might</em> work in MySQL, but don‚Äôt be surprised if it doesn‚Äôt. The same is true across Microsoft‚Äôs SQL Server, Oracle Database, BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake, ClickHouse and any other database you can think of. The different flavours of SQL used by these databases are called ‚Äúdialects‚Äù.</p>
<p>This can make it daunting to get started, but it‚Äôs no different than getting into Software Engineering. There‚Äôs a million programming languages and most people start with one and then try a bunch of others.</p>
<p>So, pick any database, don‚Äôt worry about the dialect. The database is simply a vehicle for you to learn SQL.</p>
<p>Stuck? Start with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a>. It‚Äôs the world‚Äôs favorite free, open source database. You can‚Äôt go wrong starting with Postgres.</p>
<p>Follow some simple tutorials; get it set up, load some data and start asking questions with SQL.</p>
<p>Google around for ‚ÄúSQL challenges‚Äù, there‚Äôs loads. Some are better than others, just go through them all and challenge yourself. As your knowledge improves, look for harder problems and bigger data sets.</p>
<p>When you‚Äôre starting to feel confident - change database. Try solving the same problems with <a href="https://mariadb.org/">MariaDB</a>. Then try out <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery">Google‚Äôs BigQuery</a> (there is a generous free-tier for BigQuery, be careful to stay under the limits and you won‚Äôt pay anything).</p>
<p>Pay attention to how your queries change, particularly with more complex queries. Notice that different kinds of queries are faster or slower between databases. Get used to reading the SQL reference documentation for each of these databases.</p>
<p>If you need something more guided, there are plenty - literally <em>thousands</em> - of free SQL resources on the internet. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with following a <em>free</em> SQL introduction course, but always challenge what you learn by applying it to a different database.</p>
<p>You will have time to specialise in a specific database later in your career, now is not the time.</p>
<p><strong>If you‚Äôre in the UK, the UK Gov is sponsoring a whole bunch of entry-level bootcamps across loads of sectors. One of the biggest areas of funding is Data Engineering. I can‚Äôt vouch for these bootcamps, some look better than others, but they are <em>free</em>, so if you‚Äôre eligable, why not? <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-a-skills-bootcamp/">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-a-skills-bootcamp/</a></strong></p>
<h2 id="what-if-i-already-know-sql">What if I already know SQL?</h2>
<p>If you‚Äôre coming from a Data Analytics background, or any other role where you‚Äôre already reasonably comfortable with SQL, then you have it easy. Anyone with this background should be able to start looking for an entry-level or junior Data Engineering role.</p>
<p>Now, if you‚Äôre sitting on 15 years of experience as an Analyst, going back to a junior role might not be something you‚Äôre willing to do - but that‚Äôs a different discussion.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What‚Äôs next?</h2>
<p>What about Python? Pandas? dbt? Rust? Airflow? Spark?</p>
<p>Later. These are all things you can learn on the job <em>if the job even needs them</em>.</p>
<p>Go get your first data job. I‚Äôm not going to tell you it will be easy. Lots of people struggle to find the right entry-level job in all fields of engineering.</p>
<p>But when you land it, make it your primary goal to absorb the knowledge from your new colleagues. Learn something every single day.</p>
<p>When the learning stops, move on. Use what you‚Äôve learnt to get a pay bump and find new people to learn from.</p>
<p>Rinse and repeat. That‚Äôs your roadmap.</p>
<p>Everything else comes later. Go get your hands dirty.</p>
<h3 id="Ô∏è-a-quick-rant-Ô∏è">üå∂Ô∏è A quick rant üå∂Ô∏è</h3>
<p><em>Unfortunately, I see a lot of bad advice handed out. Now, much of it is others just innocently sharing an opinion, but, often there is a clear financial incentive behind it. Vendors who want their tools to be the ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù to enter the industry. So-called ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù who take money from those vendors, or want to convince you to buy their Data Engineering bootcamps. Because, if data engineering is spooky and complicated, you‚Äôre more inclined to buy their ‚Äúland your first job in 90 days‚Äù course, right?</em></p>
<p><em>Now, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with vendors advertising their tools, or individuals creating genuinely helpful content that earns themselves a living. Tools have a place in the world, as do creators. But certain bad actors target junior and entry-level engineers who don‚Äôt have the experience to identify blatant bullshit from real advice. Be wary.</em></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://fev.al/posts/personal-relations/">https://fev.al/posts/personal-relations/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36717790">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    
    <p>I was reminded by a discussion with a friend why, as a manager, you should be cautious about the relations you develop with the people in your team.</p>

<p>Since the day I started to have people ‚Äúreporting to me‚Äù, I have felt weird about the hierarchical nature of the relation it creates. This is probably rooted in some form of an imposter/inferiority syndrome, which evolved into the underlying philosophy of my early management style.  To this day, I hate considering that switching to management is a promotion, because it‚Äôs just a different function<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I feel uncomfortable when people in a team are referred to as ‚Äúunder‚Äù their manager, due to the suggested superiority/inferiority it creates. The lingo of management is full of these concepts, fundamentally based on hierarchy (in which what is higher is more important), paternalism (the boss knows better than you and will tell you what), property[<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> (‚Äúit is my team‚Äù, which can be quite twisted when you talk about a group of people) and dehumanization (humans are <strong>not</strong> resources).</p>

<p>As a result I had been over-compensating in the early years of my management career, trying to distance myself from this view, because I certainly didn‚Äôt feel like I was any better<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> than people in ‚Äúmy‚Äù team. I was desperately trying to prove that I didn‚Äôt feel superior, wrapping feedback in all sorts of caveats (or worse keeping it for myself), trying to give as much autonomy as was imaginable, never telling people what to do, not forcing people to do things in a way they didn‚Äôt like, pulling as much shit as I can so that they wouldn‚Äôt have to do it, putting me at their level, oversharing, and worst of all, being their friends.</p>

<p>This behavior has positive effects, especially when the usual manager is the opposite of that. Autonomy, vulnerability, considering the human side and personal preferences, not thinking of yourself as smarter, tolerating failure, having fun, they‚Äôre all essential management traits. And being a basic, fallible human being makes a world of difference. This behavior is not an issue as long as things are going well, and people in your team are good.</p>

<p>But the day things go sideways, it backfires in an explosive way. Because at the end of the day, as a manager, you <em>will</em> have to deal with shit situations. You <em>will</em> have to give feedback that the receiver doesn‚Äôt want (but needs to hear). You <em>will</em> have to ask someone to shut up and do it anyways. You <em>will</em> have to not promote/give a raise to someone and tell them why. You <em>will</em> have to fire someone who under-performs. You <em>will</em> have to distribute some of the blame. And worst of all, as is happening to the friend I mentioned, you <em>will</em> have to lay-off people who don‚Äôt deserve it, just because the company says so.</p>

<p>Good luck doing that if everyone in your team is your buddy. I learned it the hard way, the first time I had to fire someone.</p>

<p>There is a balance to be achieved between being a frigid, all-knowing dictator, and the janitorial team servant who also doubles as party-buddy / best-friend. You can remain human, have fun and crack a joke, while not being a friend. You can prioritize other people‚Äôs opinion and remain decisive. You can be personable and bring your personality at work, yet set limits and remain professional. You can be vulnerable but still respected. You can provide hard feedback and still care at a personal level<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>You also need to come into terms that in the end, if the bucks stops with you, you cary more responsibility<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> than people in your team, and as a result have some power they don‚Äôt have.</p>

<p>Beyond that, there will come a day where you <em>have to</em> do something to someone that you <em>do not want to</em> do at a personal level. To make that easier, you need to keep some distance with the folks you manage.</p>

   <p>The Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into the popular chatbot ChatGPT. The agency says it's looking into whether the AI tool has harmed people by generating incorrect information about them, according to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/67a7081c-c770-4f05-a39e-9d02117e50e8.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_4">letter</a> sent to its parent company OpenAI.</p>   <p>The FTC's investigation, which was first <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/13/ftc-openai-chatgpt-sam-altman-lina-khan/">reported by the Washington Post</a>, is also looking into OpenAI's privacy and data security practices. A person familiar with the matter confirmed the investigation. </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1187539178" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>The 20-page letter is requesting that OpenAI turn over company records and data on several issues, including company policies and procedures, financial earnings and details of the Large Language Models it uses to train its chatbot. </p>   <p>The agency wrote that it's looking into whether the company has "engaged in unfair or deceptive practices relating to risks of harm to consumers, including reputational harm."</p>   <p>Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, responded via Twitter on Thursday afternoon saying he was disappointed to see the FTC's request start with a leak. Then added, "that said, it's super important to us that out [SIC] technology is safe and pro-consumer, and we are confident we follow the law." </p>   
   <p>The FTC's investigation<strong> </strong>is breaking new ground with government regulatory action involving the AI industry, which has exploded in popularity over the last year. Altman himself has regularly warned about the risks of AI and advised that the new technology needs to be regulated. He's <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/16/1176508612/a-leader-in-artificial-intelligence-is-urging-congress-to-regulate-it">testified before Congress</a> and met with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1187539321" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Lawmakers from New York to California have been hashing out how to regulate the burgeoning technology. Congressman Ted Lieu, D-CA, has proposed putting together an AI commission to study the impact of the technology. Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/18/1176894731/schumer-meets-with-bipartisan-group-of-senators-to-build-a-coalition-for-ai-law">working on possible AI legislation</a>. But experts say that regulation could be months, even years, off.</p>   <p>"OpenAI, Microsoft, and other companies selling generative AI systems have said they welcome regulation," said <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/bhr.stern.nyu.edu/tech-generativeai__;!!Iwwt!Qzaaz2ypzmPCqERmTPHzonlvVanI38gokjzn2D0hhtK3nxa6FeHetaJsjTQoLD53GXxb1tQ5NNNtmqwRD7o$">Paul Barrett</a>, deputy director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. "The FTC has responded appropriately--by seeking extensive disclosure of how industry leader OpenAI assembles and refines its artificial intelligence models."</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1187539488" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Under the helm of Chair Lina Khan, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/07/1161312602/lina-khan-ftc-tech">FTC has gone after major tech companies</a> such as Meta, Amazon and Microsoft. The watchdog agency also has repeatedly said that AI falls under the purview of consumer protection laws.</p>   <p>"There is no AI exemption to the laws on the books," Khan <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/25/artificial-intelligence-bias-eeoc/?itid=ap_catzakrzewski">said in an April news conference</a>.</p>   <p>Khan testified before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday to address the agency's work to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive practices. She spoke about the agency's concerns about A.I. and tools like ChatGPT saying they're being fed troves of data, and the type of data they're using is unclear.</p>   
   <p>"We've heard about reports where people's sensitive information is showing up in response to an inquiry from somebody else," Khan said. "We've heard about, libel, defamatory statements, flatly untrue things that are emerging. That's the type of fraud and deception that we're concerned about." </p>   <p>ChatGPT has come under scrutiny for parroting false information about various individuals, including radio hosts and lawyers. In one incident, the chatbot said a lawyer <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/05/chatgpt-lies/">was accused of harassing a student</a>‚Äîbut that incident never reportedly happened.</p>   <p>Along with potential risks to consumers from false statements, the FTC is also concerned about security issues with ChatGPT. In its letter, it pointed to an incident that OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/blog/march-20-chatgpt-outage">revealed</a> in March, saying a bug in its system let some users see other users chat history and "payment-related information."</p>   <p>Some industry groups and conservative think tanks have already decried the FTC's investigation, saying it could stifle innovation. </p>   <p>"The letter is clearly a shakedown by the FTC," said Will Rinehart, senior research fellow at Utah's Center for Growth and Opportunity. "And it's also a risky move. The advances coming from AI could boost US productivity. Chair Khan has put the entire industry in the crosshairs."</p>

<div data-nosnippet=""><p><iframe data-lazy-priority="high" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-BP7DhHTU-I?start=7" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><p>This is the Chungus 2, a fully working PC built inside Minecraft‚Äîso you can play Minecraft while you play Minecraft. But that's not all it does, oh no.</p><p>Also known as the Computational Humongous Unconventional Number and Graphics Unit, this machine is the lowest spec thing I think I've ever written about. But hats off to project lead Sammyuri and team for managing to push Minecraft redstone crafting to new heights.</p><p>Technically <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwHBaSySHmo" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwHBaSySHmo">someone did create a Minecraft-alike in Minecraft</a> with redstone back in 2012. And while that's damn impressive, it was only a 2D version of the game. This one plays it in 3D.</p><p>Essentially what we're looking at here is a virtual machine, only these utter ballers painstakingly crafted the components using the tools Minecraft has to offer‚Äîalong with a healthy helping of code‚Äîand put them together in-game.</p><p>"Built over a period of many many months, with a significant amount of planning and dedication," the video says in a rather swift wall-of-text splash screen.&nbsp;</p><p>It then goes on to detail an important disclaimer:</p><p>"Some viewers, for example those used to videos of simpler farms and piston doors, may not be able to comprehend the scale of this build and may suffer adverse affects including but not limited to having their minds blown in spectacular fashion."</p><p>Honestly, it is pretty mind-blowing watching all the components chugging along in real time, so we thought we'd bring you the specs so you can see what they managed to scrape together using Minecraft materials alone.</p><div><p>CHUNGUS 2 CPU specs</p><p>8 bit data, 16 bit fixed size instruction length<br>
1Hz clock speed, 4 stage instruction pipeline (fetch - decode - execute - writeback)<br>
64 byte automatic 8-way associative data cache and 256 bytes RAM<br>
Up to 256 addressable I/O ports<br>
7 general purpose registers<br>
Over 40 ALU functions, including a hardware barrel shifter, multiplier, divider and square rooter<br>
32x128 byte program pages for a total of 4KiB program storage</p></div><p>The CPU runs at 1Hz, and the AMOGUS (Absurdly Massive Operator of Graphics) graphics processor packs just 6KB of graphics memory. It's sure as hell not about to win a place in our <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/best-gaming-pc/" target="_blank">best gaming PC</a> guide, though I'm very tempted to sneak it in there when my boss isn't looking.</p><p>The 96 x 64p resolution is garbage by modern standards, and the graphics are rendered in only two colours: brown, and brown. But what did I expect? The main thing is that it works. You can craft, smelt, take fall damage, and all that good Minecraft stuff, even if you do need to be superhuman to tell what half the things on the screen are.</p><p>Of course one of the top comments is "Can it play Doom?" And although there's no evidence of that, I can tell you it runs Tetris, Snake, Conways Game of Life, and even renders Mandlebrot sets.</p><p>Sammyuri cites Mumbo Jumbo specifically "for inspiring me to begin my redstone journey back in 2013." From there they learned computer architecture and how to build it in Minecraft from the <a href="https://openredstone.org/" target="_blank" data-url="https://openredstone.org/">ORE Minecraft server</a> community, and they encourage anyone looking to learn the trade to head over and check it out.</p><p>So here's a nod to Sammyuri, Uwerta, StackDoubleFlow for putting the Chungus together, and to Dimdom10 for running the server and helping to render some of their work. May they be forever immortalised as the bringers of Minecraftception, even if the r/Minecraft mods team decided to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/x7mfdy/i_made_3d_minecraft_in_minecraft_with_only/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/x7mfdy/i_made_3d_minecraft_in_minecraft_with_only/">remove their post</a> and lock the comments section.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://almalinux.org/blog-images/23.07.13.future.png"></p><p>It‚Äôs been a whirlwind few weeks here at AlmaLinux, and I‚Äôm elated to be able to finally share this update.</p><h2 id="the-future-of-almalinux-os">The future of AlmaLinux OS</h2><p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/furthering-evolution-centos-stream">Red Hat announced</a> they will no longer be providing the means for downstream clones to continue to be 1:1 binary copies of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Very quickly, both <a href="https://almalinux.org/blog/our-value-is-our-values/">Jack</a> and <a href="https://almalinux.org/blog/impact-of-rhel-changes/">I shared</a> some initial thoughts, but we intentionally took our time deciding the next right step for AlmaLinux OS. After much discussion, the AlmaLinux OS Foundation board today has decided to drop the aim to be 1:1 with RHEL. AlmaLinux OS will instead aim to be Application Binary Interface (ABI) compatible*.</p><p><em>We will continue to aim to produce an enterprise-grade, long-term distribution of Linux that is aligned and ABI compatible with RHEL in response to our community‚Äôs needs, to the extent it is possible to do, and such that software that runs on RHEL will run the same on AlmaLinux.</em>
‚Äì From yesterday‚Äôs meeting notes:&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13q6udmzAEqHIoPf2cQJ-QJrYosaFWd_m/view">Minutes - Board Meeting #23 July, 2023</a></p><h2 id="what-this-change-means-for-users-of-almalinux-os">What this change means for users of AlmaLinux OS</h2><p>For a typical user, this will mean very little change in your use of AlmaLinux. Red Hat-compatible applications will still be able to run on AlmaLinux OS, and your installs of AlmaLinux will continue to receive timely security updates. The most remarkable potential impact of the change is that we will no longer be held to the line of ‚Äúbug-for-bug compatibility‚Äù with Red Hat, and that means that we can now accept bug fixes outside of Red Hat‚Äôs release cycle. While that means some AlmaLinux OS users may encounter bugs that are not in Red Hat, we may also accept patches for bugs that have not yet been accepted upstream, or shipped downstream.</p><h2 id="changes-to-our-development-process">Changes to our development process</h2><p>As one might anticipate, the change in our goals will require changes in our development and build processes.</p><p>One of the first things you will see is that we will include comments in our patches that include a link to where we got the patch that‚Äôs been applied (like <a href="https://git.almalinux.org/rpms/grafana/src/branch/a9/SPECS/grafana.spec#L74">Grafana‚Äôs release </a>yesterday). This change is helpful for several reasons, but it helps us specifically further our goal of transparency.</p><p>We will also start asking anyone who <a href="https://bugs.almalinux.org/">reports bugs in AlmaLinux OS</a> to attempt to test and replicate the problem in CentOS Stream as well, so we can focus our energy on correcting it in the right place.</p><h2 id="whats-next">What‚Äôs next?</h2><p>Now that we will no longer be holding ourselves to being a 1:1 Red Hat downstream rebuild, we are taking some time to consider the possibilities around what that means. We will continue to provide updates around that process and will include the members of the AlmaLinux OS Foundation in that conversation and decision-making process as well.</p><p>There are also a ton of exciting developments and partnerships in the works that we will be able to announce in the coming weeks and months.</p><h2 id="commitment-to-open-source">Commitment to Open Source</h2><p>While all of these changes open up a lot of opportunities, we want to be clear about the fact that we are still dedicated to being good open source citizens. We‚Äôll continue to contribute upstream in Fedora and CentOS Stream and to the greater Enterprise Linux ecosystem, just as we have been doing since our inception, and we invite our community to do the same!</p><h2 id="thank-you-and-how-to-help">Thank you, and how to help!</h2><p>I want to say thank you to everyone who has reached out with interest and offers of assistance in the last few weeks, and to our users for making it clear that they understand and continue to see our value in the Enterprise Linux ecosystem.</p><p>Thanks also to our individual <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/AlmaLinux">sponsors</a> and <a href="https://opencollective.com/almalinux-os-foundation">backers</a> in addition to our corporate sponsors. You are the biggest part of the reason we can continue to provide AlmaLinux OS free forever.</p><p>If you have any interest in helping us out, there are a ton of ways to get involved. For folks that have time to offer: the Infrastructure and Cloud SIGs are always welcoming more folks, and the Marketing and Membership committees are looking for help, too! If you want to show support but don‚Äôt have much time, just joining the foundation is a great way to <a href="https://almalinux.org/members/">join us</a>. You can also convince your company to become a sponsor or just back us yourself as an individual <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/AlmaLinux">on GitHub</a> or <a href="https://opencollective.com/almalinux-os-foundation">OpenCollective</a>.</p><p>There‚Äôs a lot of work to be done, and we are very excited to welcome you.</p><p>‚Äì-</p><p>* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface">ABI compatibility</a> in our case means working to ensure that applications built to run on RHEL (or RHEL clones) can run without issue on AlmaLinux. Adjusting to this expectation removes our need to ensure that everything we release is an exact copy of the source code that you would get with RHEL.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>
Jul 10, 2023
</h2>
<p>
Mayor Michelle Wu today announced the City will launch a new ‚ÄúDowntown Office to Residential Conversion Pilot Program,‚Äù a public-private partnership program to incentivize the conversion of underutilized office buildings to residential use in Downtown this fall.</p>
<p>
The program, which is anticipated to begin accepting applications this fall, will be administered jointly by the Boston Planning &amp; Development Agency (BPDA), Mayor's Office of Housing (MOH), and the City of Boston Finance Cabinet to help meet City goals of creating housing units Downtown and having more consistent foot traffic throughout the week to support Downtown businesses. This program may be modified to acknowledge and respond to changing market conditions.</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWe must take every possible action to create more housing and more affordability so that Boston‚Äôs growth meets the needs of current and future residents,‚Äù said Mayor Michelle Wu. ‚ÄúThis program will help us take advantage of the opportunity we have to rethink Downtown as a space where people from all over come together to collaborate, create, live, and play.‚Äù</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThrough this conversion program, we seek to incentivize lenders, property owners, downtown stakeholders, and the State to partner with the City to increase the production of much needed housing in our downtown core,‚Äù said Chief of Planning Arthur Jemison. ‚ÄúThis public private partnership opportunity is the right tool to unlock new housing and shape a new, mixed-use neighborhood Downtown.‚Äù</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBy converting office space into residential homes, we can fulfill the housing needs of our thriving City, while revitalizing and stabilizing our downtown neighborhood," said Chief of Housing Sheila Dillon. ‚ÄúNew residents will enjoy the advantages of living in a neighborhood with many amenities, including shopping options, recreational spaces and multiple transportation hubs. This initiative aligns with this administration‚Äôs dedication to creating accessible and equitable housing in every neighborhood, strengthening our small businesses and commercial centers.‚Äù</p>
<p>
The program would offer owners of commercial office buildings Downtown reduced property tax rates in return for immediately converting their buildings to residential uses. Based on studies prepared for the City as part of <a href="https://www.bostonplans.org/planning/planning-initiatives/plan-downtown">PLAN: Downtown</a>, a rate reduction by up to 75% of the standard tax rate for residential for up to 29 years could provide a strong incentive to encourage conversion. This would be implemented through a public-private partnership that will enable the BPDA, the City, and the proponent to enter into a payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) agreement. These terms were developed with the assistance of outside experts in order to make residential construction economically possible in the short term given the high cost of such conversions. These projects will also receive the support of the new Ombudsperson‚Äôs office at the BPDA to help with streamlining the approvals process from other City departments following BPDA Board approval. Final program parameters will be defined when applications are made available this fall.</p>
<p>
The program is planned to be time-limited and will only accept applications through June of 2024. To be eligible, projects must comply with the proposed Inclusionary Zoning standards when approved; and the new Stretch Code‚Äôs energy efficiency standards. Applicants will be encouraged to maintain ground floor retail or other public uses. Projects will be required to start construction by October 2025, and will be subject to paying any forgone taxes if these commitments are not met. In order to recoup the forgone tax revenue over time, the City will also require a 2% payment on future sales of the property.</p>
<p>
Following the release of a <a href="https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/file/2022/10/Revive%20and%20Reimagine%20-%20a%20Strategy%20to%20Revitalize%20Boston's%20Downtown%20-%20Oct%202022.pdf" target="_blank">Downtown Revitalization Report</a> released in October of 2022 that showed post-pandemic commercial office space vacancy rates are approximately 20 percent, Downtown neighborhood planners facilitated several conversations with developers to gather information on interest in residential conversions and possible pathways to achieve more housing Downtown. The BPDA also contracted HR&amp;A Advisors Inc. to produce a report on the feasibility of office conversion in Downtown Boston and the Financial District. This research all suggested that partnership from the City was the only financially feasible path forward for private development to complete residential conversions. The study was conducted alongside PLAN: Downtown, the BPDA‚Äôs ongoing Downtown planning initiative, a draft of which will be released in August 2023. This program furthers the Plan‚Äôs goals to increase residential growth downtown and revitalize the area through a greater mix of uses while also preserving the historic urban fabric that makes Boston‚Äôs Downtown so unique.</p>
<p>
The program is part of Mayor Wu‚Äôs <a href="https://www.bostonplans.org/news-calendar/news-updates/2023/01/26/in-state-of-the-city-address-mayor-wu-announces">ambitious growth agenda</a> for Boston, which is focused on advancing the City‚Äôs resilience, affordability, and equity goals in order to make Boston the best city in the country to raise a family. The agenda also includes the creation of a City Planning and Design Department operating under the direction of Chief of Planning Arthur Jemison, and the <a href="https://www.boston.gov/news/katharine-lusk-named-executive-director-planning-advisory-council" target="_blank">appointment of Katharine Lusk to lead the newly created Planning Advisory Council</a> which was created to coordinate planning processes across City departments. The Mayor also committed to update Boston‚Äôs zoning code to create thousands of additional housing units in Boston‚Äôs squares and corridors and <a href="https://www.boston.gov/news/members-steering-committee-advise-reforms-article-80-development-review-process-announced" target="_blank">reform</a> the <a href="https://www.bostonplans.org/projects/development-review/what-is-article-80">Article 80</a> process to increase speed and predictability for development.</p>

Murray" data-headline="Remembering Lithium-Ion Battery Pioneer John Goodenough" data-page-title="Remembering Lithium-Ion Battery Pioneer John Goodenough - IEEE Spectrum"><p>Nobel Laureate <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2019/goodenough/facts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">John B. Goodenough</a>, one of the inventors of the lithium-ion battery, died on 25 June at age 100.</p><p>Goodenough, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Texas at Austin</a>, authored more than 800 technical papers during his career. He and his colleagues were recently granted a <a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/20220115739" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. patent</a>, shortly before his 100th birthday.</p><p>A mathematician and physicist by education, Goodenough had a 70-year career in physics and chemistry. He probably is best known for developing the lithium cobalt oxide cathode in 1980‚Äîwhich became the foundation for <a href="https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/en/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=200902083334341504" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sony‚Äôs first</a> commercial lithium-ion battery in 1991.</p><p>For that, he won a 2019 <a href="https://region8today.ieeer8.org/nobel-prize-in-chemistry-2019-is-awarded-for-the-development-of-the-lithium-ion-battery/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a>, sharing the award with <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38243696500" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">M. Stanley Whittingham</a>, who created the lithium-ion concept, and <a href="https://www.asahi-kasei.com/asahikasei-brands/interview/yoshino/profile/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Akira Yoshino</a>, who developed the anode chemistry that was used in Sony‚Äôs first lithium-ion battery.</p><p>Goodenough was awarded the <a href="https://ieeetv.ieee.org/ieeetv-specials/2012-ieee-honors-medal-for-environmental-and-safety-technologies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2012 IEEE Medal for Environmental and Safety Technologies</a> for discoveries that ‚Äúpaved the way for development of the rechargeable lithium-ion battery technology.‚Äù</p><p>Starting in the 1990s, his lithium cobalt oxide cathode was used in many electronic products including camcorders, laptop computers, and mobile phones. It later became the chemistry of choice for early electric cars including the <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/tesla/roadster/2008/review/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2008 Tesla Roadster</a>.</p><p>Within the battery community, Goodenough is known for more than just lithium cobalt oxide, though. He helped develop three of the five most commonly used types of lithium-ion chemistries. His first was lithium cobalt oxide. His second, lithium manganese oxide, is used in power tools, medical devices, and some <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electric-vehicles">electric vehicles</a>. His third, lithium iron phosphate, is now one of the most popular battery chemistries in the automotive industry.</p><h2>Overcoming struggles with dyslexia</h2><p>Born in Jena, Germany, Goodenough grew up in Woodbridge, Conn., about 13 kilometers from <a href="https://www.yale.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Yale</a>, where his father was a religion professor.</p><p>Goodenough was dyslexic and struggled to read‚Äîwhich almost caused him to be held back in the sixth grade.</p><p>‚ÄúI was so frustrated that I couldn‚Äôt read,‚Äù he wrote in his memoir, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Witness_to_Grace/K5T8oAEACAAJ?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Witness to Grace</em></a>. ‚ÄúAnd, of course, my [older] brother read really well, and my father was a professor with a lot of books to read. It was terrible.‚Äù</p><p>Goodenough taught himself to read and became a high-achieving student in high school. But even after gaining acceptance to Yale, he said, he steered clear of all courses with long reading lists, fearing that he wouldn‚Äôt be able to keep up. </p><p>After graduating in 1943 with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in mathematics, Goodenough joined the U.S. Army. He worked as a meteorologist and was tasked with predicting the weather for the Allies‚Äô D-Day invasion.</p><p>Following World War II, he pursued a doctorate in physics at the <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Chicago</a>. He studied under <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6781744" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Enrico Fermi</a>, the physicist who created the world‚Äôs first nuclear chain reaction, and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4640583" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Edward Teller</a>, the so-called ‚Äúfather of the hydrogen bomb.‚Äù His doctoral supervisor was <a href="https://history.aip.org/phn/11806003.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Clarence Zener</a>, whose diode famously allowed current to flow in reverse.</p><p>After Goodenough earned a Ph.D. in 1952 in solid-state physics, he joined MIT‚Äôs <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lincoln Laboratory</a>, in Lexington, Mass., as a researcher. He was part of a team there that developed the world‚Äôs first random-access magnetic memory. His ability to cross disciplines started at MIT.</p><p>‚ÄúAt Lincoln Lab, in order to solve problems, we had to bring physics and chemistry together with engineering,‚Äù he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ylhy-utbXY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said during an interview</a> in 2016.</p><p><img alt="Photo of an olderman in a tie in front of a flowered tree.

It was there that Goodenough made his mark while working on a rechargeable lithium battery with<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koichi_Mizushima_(scientist)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Koichi Mizushima</a>, a postdoctoral researcher. </p><p><a href="https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Exxon</a> researcher <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38243696500" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Whittingham</a> had developed a lithium titanium disulfide battery in the 1970s; Goodenough decided to replace the titanium disulfide with lithium cobalt oxide. It gave the battery a significant voltage boost: from 2.4 to 4 volts. The higher voltage made his new battery chemistry almost impossible to ignore.</p><p>Goodenough patented his battery in 1980, signing away his financial claim to it in order to fund the patent.</p><p>Sony produced its first commercial lithium-ion battery in 1991 using Goodenough‚Äôs and Mizushima‚Äôs cobalt oxide cathode. The company originally employed the battery in its <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/CorporateInfo/History/sonyhistory-f.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Handycam</a>, and the lithium-ion technology soon made its way into billions of mobile phones and laptop computers.</p><p>While still at Oxford in 1981, Goodenough worked with <a href="https://www.anl.gov/profile/michael-m-thackeray" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michael M. Thackeray</a> on a lithium manganese oxide battery. The LMO battery was less expensive and safer to use than lithium cobalt oxide, and it became a mainstay in tools and medical devices. In 2010 Nissan used it in its <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/reviews/2010-nissan-leaf-first-look/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Leaf</a> electric car.</p><p>Goodenough moved back to the United States in 1986 and joined the University of Texas at Austin as a professor of mechanical engineering. He worked on another lithium-ion chemistry there in 1995: lithium iron phosphate. </p><p>At first, he had little confidence in the chemistry, thinking it was too low in energy. But French battery scientist <a href="https://cicenergigune.com/en/michel-armand" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michel Armand</a> called Goodenough and offered to collaborate on it. The duo created a lithium-ion battery with lower voltage but also lower cost and greater safety.</p><p>Twenty-five years later, the battery is gaining momentum in the auto industry as a means of reducing the cost of electric cars. Today it is being employed by Chinese EV manufacturers including <a href="https://www.byd.com/us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BYD</a>, as well as by <a href="https://www.ford.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ford</a>, <a href="https://www.gm.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">General Motors</a>, and <a href="https://www.tesla.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tesla</a>.</p><p><img alt="A group photo of three men.

"And unfortunately there's huge collateral damage to the industry, to people who are, you know, support services. I could go on and on. It will affect the economy of different regions, even, because of the sheer size of the business. It's a shame.

C software would run on it. The best way to test a new libc is to build more
code on top, and <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/tree/master/third_party">many codebases have been ported</a> to use cosmo. The
porting efforts have also helped fill out the libc API. However, a new libc must
also fit in with how C software is conventionally built ‚Äì things like
<code>./configure</code> and <code>cmake</code> ‚Äì so that porting more software is easy. When
<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/releases/tag/2.1"><code>pthreads</code> became available last year</a>, I said: <a href="https://ahgamut.github.io/2022/07/27/ape-rust-example/">porting is just a
matter of convincing the build system</a>. I believe my <code>gcc</code> patch is a
big step towards seamlessly building a lot of software with Cosmopolitan Libc.

<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/issues/97#issuecomment-816831508"><code>quickjs</code></a>. There appeared to be a common change across the ports:
<code>switch</code> statements with system values like <code>SIGTERM</code> or <code>EINVAL</code> had to be
rewritten as <code>if</code> statements. <strong>2021-03-24:</strong> I raised issue #134 on Github
about this, and got the below answer from <a href="https://github.com/jart">Justine Tunney</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Code that uses <code>switch</code> on system constants needs to be updated to use <code>if</code>
statements. That‚Äôs unavoidable unfortunately. It‚Äôs the one major breakage we
needed to make in terms of compatibility. The tradeoff is explained in the APE
blog post [‚Ä¶] C preprocessor macros relating to system interfaces need to be
symbolic. This is barely an issue, except in cases like <code>switch(errno){case EINVAL:}</code> If we feel comfortable bending the rules [‚Ä¶]</p></blockquote><p><strong>2022-09-05:</strong> After writing a bunch of ports, it was clear that the
<code>switch(errno)</code> pattern is quite common, and porting software would be much
faster if the rules could be bent automatically. I decided to try solving

handle <code>switch</code> fallthroughs. But neither of these worked completely because of
the C preprocessor and <code>ifdef</code>s. It is difficult to perform the rewrite as a
<em>text substitution</em> when you do not know which <code>ifdef</code>s would activate during
compilation. Then, maybe I could perform the rewrite as an <em>AST substitution</em> ‚Äì
if the code was available as an AST (abstract syntax tree), performing a rewrite
would be replacing one subtree with another. I could also avoid dealing with

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The only error that <code>gcc</code> would raise without the plugin is the <code>case ENOSYS</code>,
and the plugin can handle that. However, the macro substitution due to
<code>ACTUALLY(ENOSYS)</code> meant that the plugin also had to handle every other (valid)
use of <code>ENOSYS</code>, which could (hopefully) be avoided by patching <code>gcc</code> instead.</p><p>It took a while to figure out where to add my code into the <code>gcc</code> source tree,
but the overall design of the plugin became simpler. Instead of <code>-fplugin</code>, the
code was now activated with a compiler flag <code>-fportcosmo</code>. To my great relief,
I could delete all my macro-related hacks. Now I could just intercept the parser
error instead: right before <code>gcc</code> raised a <code>case is not constant</code> error, check
if <code>flag_portcosmo</code> is active, and if yes, perform the necessary substitution.
The AST rewriting code was a copy-paste from the plugin, and it was executed
by <code>gcc</code> right before invoking other plugin callbacks.</p><h2 id="porting-software-with-the-patched-gcc">Porting software with the patched <code>gcc</code></h2><p><strong>2023-06-05:</strong> At this stage, the patched <code>gcc</code> was passing all the test cases
I had written for the plugin earlier, and new binaries were added into the
Cosmopolitan Libc monorepo. This allowed for compiling a lot more code, leading
to fixes and improvements. Building <code>lua</code> was now straightforward, and for
<code>python3.11</code> I added some changes to access the ZIP store within the executable.
I found out where <code>g++</code> raised the <code>case constant</code> error so <code>ninja</code> could build.

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>With that, <code>ncurses</code> built without a complaint. Note that the C standard allows
<code>case</code> labels to only be compile-time constants, and my patched compiler will
still raise a warning when you do something like this, but otherwise‚Ä¶</p><p><img src="https://ahgamut.github.io/images/patch-gcc/portal_gun.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="" height=""></p><p><code>./configure</code> flags, run <code>make</code> and ... you got it! you f****** got it!</p><h2 id="closing-notes">Closing Notes</h2><p><strong>2023-07-13:</strong> To port software to Cosmopolitan Libc, you just need to convince
the build system. I mentioned this last year, and this <code>gcc</code> patch experiment
was to reduce the amount of convincing you would need to do. One of the
motivations for this experiment was to find an answer to the question ‚Äúwhat is
the minimum amount of source code that would need to change in order to port
something to Cosmopolitan Libc?‚Äù I am glad to find out that the answer is less
than ten lines in most cases, and could even be zero.</p><p>Of course, my patch isn‚Äôt perfect. It can‚Äôt handle some anonymous structs,
<code>enum</code>s, <code>const int</code>s, or amazing things like using <code>SIGILL</code> as an array index
within an initializer. Rare compiler crashes may still occur in some weird
<code>static</code> initializations, or if you try stuffing <code>SIGTERM</code> into a <code>static const int8_t</code>. But I‚Äôve spent a good chunk of time removing obvious counterexamples,
and a lot of popular software builds seamlessly. A stringent testing setup will
reveal more things to improve.</p><p>If you prefer, you can still rewrite the <code>switch</code> statements and <code>struct</code>
initializers by hand, but for many cases the compiler can do it for you, and all
that is necessary for a port is to specify the right flags to <code>./configure</code> or
<code>cmake</code>. If you can build your C software statically (bonus points if it builds
with <code>musl</code>), there‚Äôs a decent chance it builds with Cosmopolitan Libc right
now. Just try to build it! There are lots of possibilities.</p><hr></div></div>]]></description>

<fbs-ad position="top" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-top"></fbs-ad>
<p>Cyrus Hodes, an artificial intelligence entrepreneur, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23873690-2c08f586-1e20-4303-8536-13ba3940c4e9" target="_blank" title="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23873690-2c08f586-1e20-4303-8536-13ba3940c4e9" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23873690-2c08f586-1e20-4303-8536-13ba3940c4e9" aria-label="filed the lawsuit">filed the lawsuit</a> on Thursday to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. It alleges that he was misled by Mostaque into believing his 15% stake in the business was ‚Äúworthless‚Äù just months before Stability AI‚Äôs August 2022 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2022/09/07/stability-ai-funding-round-1-billion-valuation-stable-diffusion-text-to-image/" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2022/09/07/stability-ai-funding-round-1-billion-valuation-stable-diffusion-text-to-image/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2022/09/07/stability-ai-funding-round-1-billion-valuation-stable-diffusion-text-to-image/" aria-label="fundraise">fundraise</a> of more than $100 million at a $1 billion valuation from venture capital firms Coatue and Lightspeed. The company, which is best known for its association with the viral text-to-image generation system Stable Diffusion, has since emerged as one of the leading public faces of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/02/02/inside-chatggpts-breakout-moment-and-the-race-for-the-future-of-ai/" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/02/02/inside-chatggpts-breakout-moment-and-the-race-for-the-future-of-ai/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/02/02/inside-chatggpts-breakout-moment-and-the-race-for-the-future-of-ai/" aria-label="generative AI boom">generative AI boom</a>.</p>

<p>In the suit, Hodes says he sold his stake to Mostaque for $100 across two transactions in October 2021 and May 2022. In doing so, he alleges he was ‚Äúfraudulently cheated‚Äù out of equity that within months would have been worth $150 million on an undiluted basis because Mostaque withheld information about active fundraising attempts and a planned business pivot into AI text-to-image generation.</p>

<p>The suit further accuses Mostaque of destroying evidence after being notified by Hodes‚Äô counsel of potential legal action in December 2022. Mostaque wrote in a March 2023 <a href="https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1633631383166889985" target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1633631383166889985" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1633631383166889985" aria-label="Twitter post">Twitter post</a> that his ‚ÄúWhatsApp got deleted,‚Äù which the complaint alleges to have been intentional.</p>

<p>Avi Weitzman, a partner at law firm Paul Hastings who is representing Hodes, described the maneuver as a ‚Äúshocking swindling‚Äù in a statement shared with <em>Forbes</em>. ‚ÄúThis was corporate greed at its worst. We look forward to a full airing of Defendants‚Äô wrongdoing in Court,‚Äù he wrote.</p>

<p>Stability AI was unable to provide comment at the time of publication.</p><p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2023/06/04/stable-diffusion-emad-mostaque-stability-ai-exaggeration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="The AI Founder Taking Credit For Stable Diffusion's Success Has A History Of Exaggeration" data-ga-track="forbesEmbedly:https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2023/06/04/stable-diffusion-emad-mostaque-stability-ai-exaggeration/"><span><span>MORE FROM FORBES</span><span>The AI Founder Taking Credit For Stable Diffusion's Success Has A History Of Exaggeration</span><small>By <span>Kenrick Cai</span></small></span><span><span></span></span></a></p><p>The lawsuit also claims that Mostaque ‚Äúembezzled funds‚Äù from external investors to pay the rent for his family‚Äôs London apartment and his children‚Äôs schooling.

Motez Bishara, a spokesperson for the company, said at the time the couple had made loans to the business and sums owed to, or by, the couple were settled by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Hodes was an early collaborator with Mostaque on a business idea of using artificial intelligence to help governmental agencies address the Covid-19 pandemic. He appears alongside Mostaque in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehjVRmHqTvA" target="_blank" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehjVRmHqTvA" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehjVRmHqTvA" aria-label="virtual event">virtual event</a> for the project‚Äôs launch on YouTube. But the business failed to take off and was scrapped the following year. ‚ÄúLots of people promised a lot and they didn‚Äôt come through,‚Äù Mostaque previously told <em>Forbes</em>. Hodes‚Äô lawsuit alleges that a key reason for the project‚Äôs failure was that Mostaque was ‚Äúsecretly diverting‚Äù his attention and company resources to Stability‚Äôs AI image generation efforts.</p>
<p>The case has similarities to another lawsuit leveled against the startup best known for its association with the viral text-to-image generation system Stable Diffusion. In May, Tayab Waseem claimed that Mostaque reneged on an agreement to grant him a 10% cofounder stake in the company. That suit, which was <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epvzam/stability-ai-co-founder-sued-ceo-for-10-percent-of-the-company" target="_blank" title="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epvzam/stability-ai-co-founder-sued-ceo-for-10-percent-of-the-company" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.vice.com/en/article/epvzam/stability-ai-co-founder-sued-ceo-for-10-percent-of-the-company" aria-label="first reported by Vice">first reported by Vice</a>, was voluntarily dismissed by Waseem on the same day. (Stability AI previously did not comment on Waseem‚Äôs suit.)</p>
<p>Waseem‚Äôs complaint also portrays Hodes as a cofounder of Stability. It includes a slide from a company investment pitch deck which states that ‚ÄúEmad [Mostaque] founded stability.ai with Cyrus [Hodes] on the premise that the principles he used as a former hedge fund CIO in emerging markets and technology could be used to solve large problems and create huge value.‚Äù</p>

<p>Our universe could be twice as old as current estimates, according to a new study that challenges the dominant cosmological model and sheds new light on the so-called "impossible early galaxy problem."

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>The work is published in the journal <i>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</i>.
</p><p>"Our newly-devised model stretches the galaxy formation time by a several billion years, making the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/universe/" rel="tag">universe</a> 26.7 billion years old, and not 13.7 as previously estimated," says author Rajendra Gupta, adjunct professor of physics in the Faculty of Science at the University of Ottawa.
</p><p>For years, astronomers and physicists have calculated the age of our universe by measuring the time elapsed since the Big Bang and by studying the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/oldest+stars/" rel="tag">oldest stars</a> based on the redshift of light coming from distant galaxies. In 2021, thanks to new techniques and advances in technology, the age of our universe was thus estimated at 13.797 billion years using the Lambda-CDM concordance model.
</p><p>However, many scientists have been puzzled by the existence of stars like the Methuselah that appear to be older than the estimated age of our universe and by the discovery of early galaxies in an advanced state of evolution made possible by the James Webb Space Telescope. These galaxies, existing a mere 300 million years or so after the Big Bang, appear to have a level of maturity and mass typically associated with billions of years of cosmic evolution. Furthermore, they're surprisingly small in size, adding another layer of mystery to the equation.
</p><p>Zwicky's tired light theory proposes that the redshift of light from distant galaxies is due to the gradual loss of energy by photons over vast cosmic distances. However, it was seen to conflict with observations. Yet Gupta found that "by allowing this theory to coexist with the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/expanding+universe/" rel="tag">expanding universe</a>, it becomes possible to reinterpret the redshift as a hybrid phenomenon, rather than purely due to expansion."
</p><p>In addition to Zwicky's tired light theory, Gupta introduces the idea of evolving "coupling constants," as hypothesized by Paul Dirac. Coupling constants are <a href="https://phys.org/tags/fundamental+physical+constants/" rel="tag">fundamental physical constants</a> that govern the interactions between particles. According to Dirac, these constants might have varied over time. By allowing them to evolve, the timeframe for the formation of early galaxies observed by the Webb telescope at high redshifts can be extended from a few hundred million years to several billion years. This provides a more feasible explanation for the advanced level of development and mass observed in these ancient galaxies.
</p><p>Moreover, Gupta suggests that the traditional interpretation of the "cosmological constant," which represents <a href="https://phys.org/tags/dark+energy/" rel="tag">dark energy</a> responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe, needs revision. Instead, he proposes a constant that accounts for the evolution of the coupling constants. This modification in the cosmological model helps address the puzzle of small galaxy sizes observed in the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/early+universe/" rel="tag">early universe</a>, allowing for more accurate observations.

Apple says it gets one every year.&nbsp;</b></i></h2><p><b>Key Points:&nbsp;</b></p><ul><li><p>In its May earnings call, Apple claimed that the iPhone 14 had a 99% customer satisfaction rating citing a third party research firm it hired.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Apple has made a similar claim in every single earnings call for the past seven years.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>A customer satisfaction rating this high is nearly impossible to find using traditional survey methods and a representative sample.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Independent sources find iPhone satisfaction ratings significantly lower than what Apple claims.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Apple‚Äôs claimed iPhone satisfaction is far higher than what other consumer companies and brands claim for beloved products.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>We asked Apple‚Äôs press team to explain how the company arrived at these results. They opened our email 73 times, but didn‚Äôt respond.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Our best guess is that Apple wants to make bold customer satisfaction claims, and has hired a third-party research firm that will produce those numbers to make them seem more credible ‚Äì and perhaps to provide plausible deniability.</p></li><li><p>That firm is likely using a highly unrepresentative sample of tech enthusiasts and early adopters to generate extraordinary satisfaction numbers that Apple then presents as representative of consumers generally.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Toward the end of its earnings call in May, Apple made an extraordinary claim: ‚ÄúThe latest survey of US Consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 99% for the iPhone 14 family,‚Äù Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem is a 99% satisfaction rate is so high, there‚Äôs almost no way to get it using standard survey methods and a representative sample.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúEven if every single person actually loved their iPhone it would still be nearly impossible to find near unanimous satisfaction using traditional survey methods,‚Äù said economist and PerfectRec founder Joe Golden. ‚ÄúA few percent of people just won‚Äôt understand the question, or will give the wrong response by mistake,‚Äù Golden said.&nbsp;</p><p>If Apple‚Äôs claims of 99% satisfaction were true, it would mean the iPhone 14 was not only the most popular mass market consumer product of all time, but it would also probably make it the most popular&nbsp;<i>anything of all time.&nbsp;</i>To get a sense of just how extraordinary Apple‚Äôs iPhone 14 claims were, we looked at some other satisfaction numbers and approval ratings for context.&nbsp;</p><p>America‚Äôs favorite holiday, Thanksgiving, enjoys 82% popularity according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1277607/most-popular-holidays-in-the-united-states/#:~:text=Thanksgiving%2C%20Memorial%20day%2C%20and%20Veterans,Veterans%20day%20with%2077%20percent."><u>2023 survey by Statista</u></a>. Memorial Day comes in second at 77%.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/?ref_=nv_mv_250"><u>three most popular movies</u></a>&nbsp;of all time on IMDB are&nbsp;<i>The Shawshank Redemption</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Godfather</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Dark Knight</i>. They have ratings of 9.2, 9.2 and 9.0 respectively. </p><p>If we look at some of the most popular retailers in America, we find satisfaction ratings maxing out in the 80s. Trader Joe‚Äôs fans will stand in line for hours for groceries but still give the store just an 84%&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theacsi.org/industries/retail/supermarkets/"><u>satisfaction rating</u></a>, according to a survey by the American Customer Satisfaction Institute. 82% of Costco customers say they are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theacsi.org/industries/retail/general-merchandise-retailers/"><u>satisfied with the retailer</u></a>, and they pay $60-120 a year for the privilege of shopping there.</p><p>What about politics where tribal loyalties tend to trump facts?&nbsp;<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/203006/obama-job-approval-ratings-politically-polarized-far.aspx"><u>According to Gallup</u></a>, President Barack Obama enjoyed an average approval rating across his two terms of just 83%&nbsp;<i>among Democrats</i>. Donald Trump performed a bit better among Republicans while in the White House, averaging an&nbsp;<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx"><u>86% approval rating</u></a>&nbsp;from members of his own party. Even Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Asad only&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Syrian_presidential_election"><u>managed 95% support</u></a>&nbsp;in the last election, and that was condemned by the United Nations for being undemocratic.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the only other poll we could find claiming 99% support for&nbsp;<i>anything</i>&nbsp;was a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/is-america-still-sweet-on-ice-cream-national-survey-reveals-our-relationship-may-be-cooling-off-300488561.html#:~:text=Among%20the%20findings%3A%20While%2099,due%20to%20%22health%22%20concerns."><u>press release</u></a>&nbsp; that said 99% of Americans enjoy ice cream. It was authored by a frozen dessert company. I‚Äôd note they didn‚Äôt bother sharing methodology for such an implausible claim.&nbsp;</p><p>So what is going on with Apple‚Äôs claimed iPhone satisfaction rates? We reached out to Apple to find out, but didn‚Äôt get any response. When we kept digging, this is what we found.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading--third-party-sources-find-much-lower-satisfaction-rates-for-the-iphone">Third-party sources find much lower satisfaction rates for the iPhone</h2><p>Independent sources do not match Apple‚Äôs claimed satisfaction rates.&nbsp;</p><p>The American Consumer Satisfaction Institute regularly surveys consumers about cell phones and wireless carriers. Their&nbsp;<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/05/16/iphone-beats-samsung-in-satisfaction-survey/"><u>latest survey</u></a>&nbsp;found iPhone satisfaction at 81% for 5G models and 78% for other models. That was the highest combined satisfaction rate of any smartphone manufacturer, but still a far cry from the company‚Äôs own findings through 451 Research.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/6fetvjj0zxvn/35oovuXDQwc5z2k5OE3DZh/dee474b1b912e34dedb3c640b2828bf0/satisfaction-survey.png?fit=fill&amp;w=768" height="639" width="768" alt=""></p><p>User reviews on Google tell a similar story. People love the iPhone, but not as much as Apple claims.&nbsp;</p><p>While Apple has not published their methodology, a&nbsp;<a href="https://451research.com/images/Marketing/press_releases/iPhone-PR-1_31_2018-f.pdf?&amp;utm_campaign=2018_vocul_apple_pr&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=press_release&amp;utm_term=apple_iphone_pr"><u>2018 press release</u></a>&nbsp;about the survey from its creator, 451 Research shows at least two categories of support: ‚ÄúVery Satisfied‚Äù and ‚ÄúSomewhat Satisfied.‚Äù If Apple and 451 Research are using a traditional five-point satisfaction scale ranging from ‚ÄúNot At All Satisfied‚Äù to ‚ÄúVery Satisfied,‚Äù those responses would correspond to four and five stars respectively.&nbsp; If we map that to ratings for the iPhone on Google Reviews, which uses a five-star scale, we find that&nbsp; between 87% to 90% of users are rating the iPhone 4+ stars, depending on the model. Those are great reviews, but they are not a 99% satisfaction rate.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if you took the most favorable approach to Apple and said anything that‚Äôs not a one-star review counts as satisfied, you would still fall short of Apple‚Äôs claimed satisfaction rates. Six percent of users rate the various iPhone 14 models 1 star on Google as of July 6, 2023. That extremely generous scale would translate into a satisfaction rate of 94%, still not the 99% Apple is claiming.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading--when-other-consumer-companies-brag-about-satisfaction-they-cite-much-lower-numbers">When other consumer companies brag about satisfaction, they cite much lower numbers&nbsp;</h2><p>An analysis of dozens of earnings call transcripts show that executives are usually extremely cautious about satisfaction claims.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies love talking about how happy their customers are, but in the context of heavily scrutinized public earnings calls, they tend to keep their remarks extremely vague. When the word ‚Äúsatisfaction‚Äù is used at all, it‚Äôs usually part of broad statements like Disney CEO Bob Iger pledging to ‚Äú<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4576588-walt-disney-company-dis-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript"><u>increase park capacity while preserving guest satisfaction</u></a>.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>We combed through the last four quarters of earnings transcripts from consumer favorites like Costco, Disney and McDonald‚Äôs as well as popular electronics companies like Samsung and Sony, for claims about customer satisfaction. The only quantitative claim we found was Sony touting that the PlayStation Plus subscription service enjoyed 72% customer satisfaction in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/irday/pdf/2022/GNS_E.pdf"><u>2022 investor presentation</u></a>.</p><p>Even outside of investor calls, it‚Äôs unusual for consumer-facing companies to make concrete claims about customer satisfaction. One example of the few examples we found was the appliance company Dyson, which thought an 84% customer satisfaction rating for one of its vacuum cleaners was impressive enough to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/search/news/?keyword=customer%20satisfaction&amp;page=1&amp;pagesize=100"><u>merit a press release</u></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Apple, by contrast, has claimed 98%-or-above approval in every investor call for the last half decade.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4550156-apple-inc-aapl-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript"><u>Q4, 2022</u></a>&nbsp;- ‚ÄúAnd the latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98%‚Äù - Luca Maestri</p></li><li><p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4463261-apple-inc-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-on-q4-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript"><u>Q4, 2021</u></a>&nbsp;- ‚ÄúThe latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone, and our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high.‚Äù - Luca Maestri</p></li><li><p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4382943-apple-inc-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript"><u>Q4, 2020</u></a>&nbsp;- ‚ÄúIn fact, in the U.S., the last survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined.‚Äù - Luca Maestri</p></li><li><p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4300690-apple-inc-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-on-q4-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript"><u>Q4, 2019</u></a>&nbsp;- ‚ÄúAnd in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, XS and XS Max combined.‚Äù - Luca Maestri</p></li><li><p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4217359-apple-aapl-q4-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript"><u>Q4, 2018</u></a>&nbsp;- ‚ÄúThe latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone X, 8, and 8 Plus combined.‚Äù - Luca Maestri</p></li></ul><p>You can see the full list of Apple‚Äôs earnings call satisfaction claims in the appendix. The trend goes back to at least 2011.Other research firms were hired to produce the satisfaction claims prior to 2016, finding similar results.</p><p>It‚Äôs worth noting that Apple cites third-party research firms they have hired in every single quantitative mention of customer satisfaction they make on earnings calls going back to at least 2013. Why do this? Apple is the largest company in the world and almost certainly has extremely precise in-house measures of customer satisfaction. The answer likely has to do with credibility and deniability. An extraordinary claim sounds more credible if it‚Äôs coming from an independent party, even if you pay to produce it. Furthermore, if investors or others start asking questions about something as eyebrow raising as near-universal satisfaction, it‚Äôs easier to deflect than if Apple had produced the statistic in house.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading--we-contacted-apple-and-451-research-to-try-and-figure-out-what-was-going-on-with-the-satisfaction-numbers-they-didnt-respond">We contacted Apple and 451 Research to try and figure out what was going on with the satisfaction numbers.

By not mentioning that the survey participants are highly non-representative, Apple‚Äôs claims about the survey‚Äôs results are misleading, and out of step with basic best practices when reporting survey results. Apple gives the impression that this survey is representative of the population by not indicating otherwise.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="heading--our-take">Our Take&nbsp;</h2><p>The iPhone is an extraordinary phone. We recommend it to consumers using PerfectRec every day. But we‚Äôre 99% confident something doesn‚Äôt quite add up about Apple‚Äôs customer satisfaction claims.*&nbsp;</p><p><b>Consider:&nbsp;</b></p><ul><li><p>Independent sources report iPhone satisfaction levels that are significantly lower than what Apple claims.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The iPhone 14 did not get a great critical reception when it launched late last year, and earlier research by PerfectRec found user reviews for the model were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.perfectrec.com/posts/the-iphone-14-is-apples-biggest-disappointment"><u>significantly worse</u></a>&nbsp;than previous editions of the handset.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Other companies with beloved consumer products tout much lower satisfaction rates when they talk about satisfaction at all.</p></li><li><p>It would be extraordinarily hard to find near-universal satisfaction using normal survey research methods and a representative sample.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>It is likely that Apple continues to work with 451 Research not despite its unusual results but because of them. Apple wants to make extraordinary customer satisfaction claims and has found an outside research firm to produce them. 451 Research polls an unrepresentative panel of tech professionals, early adopters and gadget enthusiasts about their iPhone satisfaction, which Apple presents as reflecting the opinions of iPhone users as a whole. It doesn‚Äôt. The iPhone is perhaps the most successful consumer product in the world. Its market long ago grew beyond early adopters and gadget enthusiasts.&nbsp;</p><p>It‚Äôs worth noting that Apple almost certainly has highly accurate internal measures of customer satisfaction. But instead of sharing those, the company instead highlights and likely misrepresent the findings of a third-party research firm they hired.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not calling on the SEC to investigate these customer satisfaction claims, since they have more important cases to go after,‚Äù Golden said.&nbsp; ‚ÄúBut extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and we believe Apple should review the survey results they trumpet on every earnings call. If they truly think they are valid, they should publish their methodology, and if not, they should issue retractions.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>*<i>In this case, it‚Äôs a figure of speech.&nbsp;</i></p><h2 id="heading--about">About:</h2><h3 id="heading--joe-golden">Joe Golden&nbsp;</h3><p>Dr. Joe Golden is founder and CEO of PerfectRec.

<p>The FCC reached out to me and is asking all of you who signed the petition to also file a comment in their docketing system for the ATSC 3 petition. This is very easy to do and will just take a few minutes. So far there are only about a dozen or so complaints filed. We can do better!! </p>

<p>2. On the first line for proceedings type in 16-142 . The system will then display the text ‚ÄúAuthorizing Permissive Use of the ‚ÄúNext Generation‚Äù Broadcasting Television Standard.‚Äù Click on that to lock in the docket number. Here‚Äôs what it looks like:</p>

<p><br>3. Fill in your information. A US address is required and note that this will be part of the public record.</p>
<div><p>4. Write your comment in the comment section. It‚Äôs important to provide some detail especially how this change will make it difficult for YOU to consume over the air television.</p><p>Below is what I submitted, you are free to <strong><em>re-purpose</em></strong> this for your own submission but DO NOT COPY AND PASTE. The commission values feedback on how this transition will impact consumers and each unique story helps build the case better than a form letter. </p></div>
<blockquote>
<p>I am writing in opposition to DRM Encryption being part of the ATSC 3.0 standard. Over the last several weeks broadcasters have aggressively rolled out encryption on their ATSC 3 signals throughout the United States. At the moment this restricts most currently available tuners from being able to tune ATSC 3 content.</p>
<p>The standard‚Äôs voluntary rollout began with much promise. Prior to ATSC 3 being enabled here in Connecticut I could not reliably receive ATSC 1.0 content. When ATSC 3 spun up last year I could finally receive reliable over the air signals at my home. That was until WFSB-TV encrypted their broadcast and I‚Äôm now blocked from watching that station.</p>
<p>Encrypting over the air signals goes against the spirit of serving the public‚Äôs interest. Encryption adds an additional and unnecessary point of failure for receiving important information during emergency situations.</p>
<p>There are anti-trust implications too. Encryption restricts the consumer‚Äôs right to watch content from the public airwaves using tuners and personal recording equipment of their choice. With ATSC 1.0 consumers have many choices for watching and recording over the air television. With ATSC 3 only equipment blessed by the broadcasters through an arduous, opaque and expensive process will be allowed to tune content. One broadcaster, E.W. Scripps, purchased a manufacturer of tuning and recording equipment giving Scripps an advantage in the marketplace over competing products.</p>
<p>The broadcasters have said encryption is important for copy protection or other nonsense about protection from hackers and ‚Äúdeep fakes.‚Äù But the reality is they are trying to protect broadcast retransmission fees that now make up a significant portion of their revenue.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the broadcasters have effectively stopped every large scale retransmission effort making encryption unnecessary to protect their broadcast exclusivity rights. What this is really about is making it more difficult for everyday consumers to watch free over the air TV in an effort to push us back onto paid subscription services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs really important if you care about this issue to make a submission. It doesn‚Äôt have to be long ‚Äì just long enough for you to convey the impact that DRM encryption will have in accessing broadcasts on the public airwaves. </p>
<p>I still plan to drop this petition off with the FCC and congressional stakeholders in person with the Antenna Man. But the more of us who tell the FCC directly the better!</p>

<ul>
<li>The European Council has ended its adoption procedure for rules related to phones with replaceable batteries.</li>
<li>By 2027, all phones released in the EU must have a battery the user can easily replace with no tools or expertise.</li>
<li>The regulation intends to introduce a circular economy for batteries.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>In the middle of June, we shared <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/replaceable-batteries-eu-2023-3335711/">a news report</a> about the future of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-phones-removable-battery-697520/">replaceable batteries in smartphones</a>. That report focused on the European Parliament voting to enact a law forcing manufacturers of all battery-powered devices ‚Äî including smartphones ‚Äî to offer easily replaceable batteries.</p><p>This week, the European Council <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/07/10/council-adopts-new-regulation-on-batteries-and-waste-batteries/" target="_blank">officially agreed</a> to the new regulation. Now, the only step left is for the European Council and Parliament to sign on the dotted line. Once they do, the clock starts ticking: any manufacturer wanting to sell phones in the EU must ensure those phones have replaceable batteries by 2027.</p><div><h2>Phones with replaceable batteries: What does this law mean?</h2>
<p>The European Council only has jurisdiction over Europe, obviously. So this law will not, technically, have an effect in any other area of the world.</p></div><p>However, that doesn‚Äôt really mean much in the grand scheme of things. Companies like Samsung, Google, Apple, etc., don‚Äôt design devices specific to Europe. Apple, for example, is not going to create a European iPhone with a replaceable battery and one for the United States without. In other words, this law will change all iPhones. It will also change all tablets, laptops, EVs, e-bikes, and anything else with a rechargeable battery.</p><p>The grace period from now until 2027 is to give OEMs enough time to redesign their products. This new law states, specifically, that users should be able to replace a battery in their phone without any special expertise or tools. Being that almost all smartphones today are designed like a ‚Äúglass sandwich‚Äù that relies on extensive use of adhesives, the very fundamentals of how companies design phones will need to change.</p><p>It‚Äôs too early to say yet how this law will change iPhones, Galaxy S phones, Pixels, etc. However, they&nbsp;<strong>will</strong> change in response to this law, which is huge news.</p><div><h2>What is the intention of this law?</h2>
<p>This law exists to force manufacturers to create a circular economy for batteries. A ‚Äúcircular economy‚Äù refers to a manufacturing model in which the resources put into it are recycled or reused as much as possible. In a perfect world, the resources needed to create a smartphone would be sourced 100% from older smartphones, so nothing new would ever need to be used. Obviously, the 100% figure would be practically impossible, but getting much closer to 100% is a very realistic goal.</p></div><div><p>Here are some other rules this new law covers related to phones with replaceable batteries:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collection of waste:&nbsp;</strong>OEMs will need to collect 63% of portable batteries that would normally go to a landfill by the end of 2027. By the end of 2030, that number should be at 73%.</li>
<li><strong>Recovery of waste:&nbsp;</strong>Lithium recovery from waste batteries will need to be at 50% by 2027. By the end of 2031, it should be at 80%, meaning 80% of the lithium inside a battery can be recovered and repurposed for new batteries.</li>
<li><strong>Recycling minimums:&nbsp;</strong>Industrial, SLI, and EV batteries will need to be made up of certain percentages of recycled content. Initially, this will be 16% for cobalt, 85% for lead, 6% for lithium, and 6% for nickel.</li>
<li><strong>Early recycling efficiency target: </strong>Nickel-cadmium batteries should have a recycling efficiency target of 80% by the end of 2025. All other batteries should be at a 50% efficiency target by 2025.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h2>What happens now?</h2>
<p>We likely won‚Äôt see anything change this year. However, over the next few years, you‚Äôll likely begin to see smartphones with slightly different designs as manufacturers move toward compliance with this new law. It will take years before manufacturers will have the designs, supply chains, and equipment needed to create phones with replaceable batteries at scale.</p></div><p>Remember that consumers expect certain things from smartphones nowadays, which will mean that OEMs can‚Äôt just go back to the old way of doing things. An IP68 rating would be very difficult to obtain while still offering a premium-feeling device with an easily replaceable battery, for example. These are hurdles OEMs will need to get over to be in compliance.</p><p>Regardless, things are going to be very different in just a few years!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><em>This article is the second in a series that explores potential privacy vulnerabilities in Apple devices. In the <a href="https://fingerprint.com/blog/apple-id-region-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first article</a>, we discussed detecting a system Apple ID region. This article presents a technique for revealing a user's first name without permissions using the mDNS protocol.</em></p><p>

<strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> <a href="https://fingerprint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fingerprint</a> as a company does not use this technique in our products, and we do not provide cross-site tracking services. We focus on detecting and preventing fraud and supporting modern privacy trends for removing third-party tracking entirely. There should be open discussions about such techniques to help internet browser providers fix them quickly.</p></div>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this article, we explain how the real name of a macOS user can be leaked through a browser without permissions. The proof of concept <a href="https://mdns-name-guesser.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo</a> is optimized for performance rather than accuracy and results may be affected by device or network configuration.</p>
<p>The name brute-forcing technique uses a pre-made list of the 50 most popular gender-specific names from a specific country origin. Our experiments showed that this is enough to detect a macOS user‚Äôs name correctly in 65% of the cases on average.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="multicast-dns-protocol-and-apple-bonjour">Multicast DNS protocol and Apple Bonjour&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The exploit implementation relies on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multicast DNS</a> (mDNS) protocol. In simple terms, the mDNS protocol is designed to register, discover, or broadcast device names over a local network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, when a specific device, such as a printer, wants to be discovered on a local network, it sends a registration UDP packet to the reserved internal IP address <code>224.0.0.251</code>, which contains a hostname like <code>HP_LaserJet_Printer.local</code>. The <code>.local</code> domain TLD indicates that the hostname should be resolved using the mDNS protocol.</p>
<p>Such packets are automatically broadcast by a router to other devices in a local network, so they can cache the hostname. Alternatively, devices can send query packets to the same reserved IP address and try to discover a specifically named device, which may not exist in the network.</p>
<p>Some examples of mDNS hostnames are:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>johns-mac-mini.local</code></li>
<li><code>david-ZenBook-UX431DA-UM431DA.local</code></li>
<li><code>james-iphone.local</code>&nbsp;</li>
<li><code>canon-mf644c.local</code></li>
<li><code>bedroom-appletv.local</code></li>
<li><code>dlinkrouter.local</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The multicast DNS protocol is widely used on Apple devices as part of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/bonjour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Bonjour</a> feature.</p>
<p>By default, Apple devices expose the first name of a user in their local hostnames, which we are going to use for the name brute-forcing technique. You can view or change your macOS local hostname in the <strong>Sharing</strong> section of <strong>System Settings.</strong></p>

<h2 id="resolving-mdns-hostnames-from-a-browser">Resolving mDNS hostnames from a browser</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the multicast DNS protocol is based on UDP packets. Browser JavaScript environments do not support arbitrary UDP sockets, so it is not possible to use the mDNS protocol directly in a browser.</p>
<p>However, we can resolve hostnames from browsers by using a timing workaround. Let‚Äôs make two regular <code>fetch</code> GET requests to existing <code>device-1.local</code> and non-existing <code>device-2.local</code> mDNS addresses:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="2" title="" src="https://fingerprint.com/static/26c7e56f5f5d571c768d19409122b586/f7616/2.png" srcset="https://fingerprint.com/static/26c7e56f5f5d571c768d19409122b586/8514f/2.png 192w,

    </span></p>
<p>The browser will try to resolve the hostname provided in a URL address. If the address is resolved, it will send a TCP packet to the 80 port, which in our case will most likely be closed. On the screenshot above you can see two different error messages:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED</code> for the existing <code>device-1.local</code></li>
<li><code>ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED</code> for non-existing <code>device-2.local</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Both errors will be mapped into the same <code>Failed to fetch</code> JavaScript error, so we can‚Äôt rely on the error type, but we can perform a timing attack. Local networks are fast, so the valid mDNS hostname registered in the network will be resolved in a reasonable time frame, which is significantly faster than the default connection timeout. In the example above, the difference is four milliseconds for a valid address versus five seconds for an invalid one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This approach is consistent enough for the proof of concept solution and works similarly in all major browsers. In practice, you can use any network JavaScript API, such as <code>iframe</code>, <code>Image</code> or <code>WebRTC</code>, to perform timing attacks for DNS resolving.</p>
<h2 id="macos-user-name-brute-forcing">MacOS user name brute-forcing</h2>
<p>As illustrated earlier, the default macOS local hostname contains the user's first name and device name. Moreover, the hostname depends on a system language locale:</p>
<ul>
<li>English: <code>&lt;name&gt;s-macbook-pro.local</code></li>
<li>French: <code>macbook-air-de-&lt;name&gt;.local</code></li>
<li>Russian: <code>mac-mini-&lt;name&gt;.local</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, we can take the top 1,000 names, the top 10 locales, and five common macOS device names. In this scenario, it would be necessary to test 50,000 distinct hostnames, which might take over an hour. A more efficient strategy would be to limit the search scope to a single locale, a single device, and the 50 most common names within that specific locale. While this affects accuracy, it makes the attack more feasible in practical terms and significantly faster in general.</p>
<p>The locale selection can be based on a browser time zone, language, or IP address location. Safari browser, for example, reveals the system locale with the <code>navigator.language</code> property, which is typically consistent with the targeted hostname locale. Also, there are other workarounds to discover the user's country of origin, such as the <a href="https://fingerprint.com/blog/apple-id-region-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple ID region detection</a> method discussed previously.</p>
<p>The device options can be narrowed down by using the screen resolution. For instance, the <code>1728x1117</code> resolution is most likely a 16-inch Macbook Pro. An extended screen can be detected by using the <code>screen.isExtended</code> property, which will fallback the device options to three to five of the most commonly used Apple macOS devices.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mdns-name-guesser.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proof of concept demo</a> has a name country origin and name gender selectors, which results in 50-100 potential hostnames that can be enumerated within seconds. Among the 100 FingerprintJS employees who participated in an internal test, the demo successfully predicted the name in 65% of instances. <a href="https://github.com/fingerprintjs/blog-macos-mdns-brute-force" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The source code is available on GitHub.</a></p>

    </span></p>
<p>It's important to mention that the proof of concept demo is simply a demonstration of the attack and may not be successful in some cases. Some of the factors that could impact the results are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The presence of rare or unique names or non-standard macOS hostnames</li>
<li>Particular network configurations or VPN networks</li>
<li>Enabled firewall in macOS network settings</li>
</ul>
<p>If the demo does not work for you, consider using the advanced configuration settings to verify the list of the probed names and the device name pattern applied. If you use a VPN, consider testing it with and without VPN, because the result may change.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Considering the inherent weaknesses and numerous limitations, this attack isn't practical. It can be effortlessly detected in the network tab of browser developer tools unless there is deliberate intent from a website owner to de-anonymize its visitors.</p>
<p>This series of articles merely explores the boundaries of internet privacy and relies on unconventional privacy breaching techniques. As another example, by combining this method with <a href="https://fingerprint.com/blog/external-protocol-flooding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">detection of installed applications</a>, there‚Äôs a potential to develop a harmful website capable of displaying your real name and job title, based on the list of professional applications used, all without requiring any permissions.</p>
<p>Even though this article mentions Apple devices running macOS, the mDNS discovery technique can be utilized in variety of ways. For instance, it could be used to perform a local network scan to detect devices such as printers, smart TVs, smart speakers, and other home IoT devices.</p>
<p>This method is also applicable to iPhones and iPads, given that <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/wi-fi-syncing-mchlada1d602/mac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sync over Wi-Fi</a> or Safari remote debug features are activated.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>In the last few months there has been a lot of hype about "passkeys"
and how they are going to change authentication forever. But that hype
will come at a cost.</p>
<p>Obsession with passkeys are about to turn your security keys (yubikeys,
feitian, nitrokeys, ...) into obsolete and useless junk.</p>
<p>It all comes down to one thing - resident keys.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-resident-key">What is a Resident Key</h2>
<p>To understand the problem, we need to understand what a
discoverable/resident key is.</p>
<p>You have probably seen that most keys support an 'unlimited' number of
accounts. This is achieved by sending a "key wrapped key" to the
security key. When the Relying Party (Authentication Server) wants to
authenticate your security key, it will provide you a "credential id".
That credential ID is an encrypted blob that only your security key can
decrypt. If your security key can decrypt that blob it yields a private
key that is specific to that single RP that you can use for signatures.</p>

<p>This is what is called a non-resident or non-discoverable credential.
The reason is that the private key must be <em>discovered</em> by the security
key having the Credential ID provided to it externally. This is because
the private keys are <em>not resident</em> inside the security enclave - only
the master key is.</p>
<p>Contrast to this, a resident key or discoverable credential is one where
the private key is <em>stored</em> in the security key itself. This allows the
security key to discover (hence the name) what private keys might be
used in the authentication.</p>

<p>Now, the primary difference here is that resident/discoverable keys
consume <em>space</em> on the security key to store them since they need to
persist - there is no credential id to rely on to decrypt with our
master key!</p>
<h3 id="are-non-resident-keys-less-secure">Are non-resident keys less secure?</h3>
<p>A frequent question here is if non resident keys are less secure than
resident ones. Credential ID's as key wrapped keys are secure since
they are encrypted with aes128 and hmaced. This prevents them being
tampered with or decrypted by an external source. If aes128 were broken
and someone could decrypt your private-key in abscence of your security
key, they probably could also break TLS encyrption, attack ssh and do
much worse. Your key wrapped keys rely on the same security features
that TLS relies on.</p>
<h2 id="resident-keys-and-your-security-key">Resident Keys and Your Security Key</h2>
<p>Now that we know what a resident key is, we can look at how these work
with your security keys.</p>
<p>Since resident keys store their key in the device, this needs to consume
<em>space</em> inside the security key. Generally, resident key slots are at a
premium on a security key. Nitrokeys for example only support 8 resident
keys. Yubikeys generally support between 20 and 32. Some keys support
<em>no</em> resident keys at all.</p>
<p>The other problem is what CTAP standard your key implements. There are
three versions - CTAP2.0, CTAP2.1PRE and CTAP2.1.</p>
<p>In CTAP2.1 (the latest) you can individually manage, update and delete
specific resident keys from your device.</p>
<p>In CTAP2.0 and CTAP2.1PRE however, you can not. You can not delete a
residentkey without <em>resetting the whole device</em>. Resetting the device
also resets your master key, meaning all your non-resident keys will no
longer work either. This makes resident keys on a CTAP2.0 and CTAP2.1PRE
device a serious commitment. You really don't want to accidentally fill
up that limited space you have!</p>
<p>In most cases, your key is <em>very likely</em> to be CTAP2.0 or CTAP2.1PRE.</p>
<h2 id="so-why-are-resident-keys-a-problem">So Why Are Resident Keys a Problem?</h2>
<p>On their own, and used carefully resident keys are great for certain
applications. The problem is the hype and obsession with <em>passkeys</em>.</p>
<p>In 2022 Apple annouced their passkeys feature on MacOS/iOS allowing the
use of touchid/faceid as a webauthn authenticator similar to your
security key. Probably quite wisely, rather than calling them
"touchid" or "credentials" or "authenticators" Apple chose to have
a nicer name for users. Honestly passkeys is a good name rather than
"webauthn authenticator" or "security key". It evokes a similar
concept to passwords which people are highly accustomed to, while also
being different enough with the 'key' to indicate that it operates in
a different way.</p>
<p>The problem (from an external view) is that passkeys was a branding or
naming term of something - but overnight authentication thought leaders
needed to be <em>on the hype</em>. "What is a passkey?". Since Apple didn't
actually define it, this left a void for our thought leaders to answer
that question for users hungry to know "what indeed is a passkey?".</p>
<p>As a creator of a relying party and the webauthn library for Rust, we
defined passkeys as the name for "all possible authenticators" that a
person may choose to use. We wanted to support the goal to remove and
eliminate passwords, and passkeys are a nice name for this.</p>
<p>Soon after that, some community members took to referring to passkeys to
mean "credentials that are synchronised between multiple devices".
This definition is at the least, not harmful, even if it doesn't
express that there are many possible types of authenticators that can be
used.</p>
<p>Some months later a person took the stage at FIDO's Authenticate
conference and annouced "a passkey is a resident key". Because of the
scale and size of the platform, this definition has now stuck. This
definition has become so invasive that even <em>FIDO</em> now use it as <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/#faq">their
definition</a>.</p>
<p>Part of the reason this definition is hyped is because it works with an
upcoming browser feature that allows autocomplete of a username and
webauthn credential if the key is resident. You don't have to type your
username. This now means that we have webauthn libraries pushing for
residentkey as a requirement for all registrations, and many people will
follow this advice without seeing the problem.</p>
<p>The problem is that security keys with their finite storage and lack of
credential management will fill up <em>rapidly</em>. In my password manager I
have more than 150 stored passwords. If all of these were to become
resident keys I would need to buy at lesat 5 yubikeys to store all the
accounts, and then another 5-10 as "backups". I really don't want to
have to juggle and maintain 10 to 15 yubikeys ...</p>
<p>This is an awful user experience to put it mildly. People who choose to
use security keys, now won't be able to due to passkeys resident key
requirements. What will also confuse users is this comes on the tail of
FIDO certified keys marketing with statements (which are true with
non-resident keys) like:</p>
<p><em>Infinite key pair storage</em></p>
<p><em>There is no limit to the number of accounts registered in [redacted]
FIDO¬Æ Security Key.</em></p>
<p>To add further insult, an expressed goal of the Webauthn Work Group is
that users should always be free to choose any authenticator they wish
without penalty. Passkeys forcing key residency flies directly in the
face of this.</p>
<p>This leaves few authenticator types which will work properly in this
passkey world. Apples own passkeys, Android passkeys, password managers
that support webauthn, Windows with TPM 2.0, and Chromium based browsers
on MacOS (because of how they use the touchid as a TPM).</p>
<h2 id="what-can-be-done">What Can Be Done?</h2>
<h3 id="submit-to-the-webauth-wg-browsers-to-change-rk-preferred-to-exclude-security-keys">Submit to the Webauth WG / Browsers to change rk=preferred to exclude security keys</h3>
<p>Rather than passkeys being resident keys, passkeys could be expanded to
be all possible authenticators where some subset opportunistically are
resident. This puts passwordless front and center with residency as a
bonus ui/ux for those who opt to use devices that support unlimited
resident keys.</p>
<p>Currently there are three levels of request an RP can make to request
resident keys. Discouraged, Preferred and Required. Here is what happens
with different authenticator types when you submit each level.</p>

<p>Notice that in rk=preferred the three columns behave the same as
rk=required?</p>
<p>Rather than passkeys setting rk=required, if rk=preferred were softened
so that on preferred meant "create a resident key only if storage is
unlimited" then we would have a situation where Android/iOS would
always get resident keys, and security keys would not have space
consumed.</p>
<p>However, so far the WG is resistant to this change. It is not out of the
question that browsers could implement this change externally, but that
would in reality be down to the chrome team to decide.</p>
<h3 id="insist-on-your-passkey-library-setting-rk-discouraged">Insist on your Passkey library setting rk=discouraged</h3>
<p>Rather than rk=required which excludes security keys, rk=discouraged is
the next best thing. Yes it means that android users won't get
conditional UI. But what do we prefer - some people have to type a
username (that already has provisions to autocomplete anyway). Or do we
damage and exclude security keys completely?</p>
<h3 id="contact-fido-and-request-rk-storage-as-a-certification-feature">Contact FIDO and request RK storage as a certification feature</h3>
<p>Currently FIDO doesn't mandate any amount of storage requirements for
certified devices. Given that FIDO also seem to want resident keys, then
they should also mandate that certified devices have the ability to
store thousands of resident keys. This way as a consumer you can pick
and select certified devices.</p>
<h3 id="something-else">Something Else?</h3>
<p>If you have other ideas on how to improve this let me know!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The hype around passkeys being resident keys will prevent - or severly
hinder - users of security keys from choosing the authenticator they
want to use online in the future.</p>

If you aren‚Äôt familiar with them: Factorio is an open-world RTS where you build and optimize supply chains in order to launch a satellite and restore communications with your home planet, and Kafka is a distributed streaming platform, which handles asynchronous communication in a durable way.</p><p id="7dd5">I wonder how far we can take the analogy between Factorio and Kafka before it starts to break down. Let‚Äôs start from scratch, explore the core Kafka concepts through Factorio visualizations, and have some fun along the way.</p><figure><figcaption>If you don‚Äôt have a lot of time to spare, don‚Äôt download Factorio.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="e1ae">Why bother with async messaging?</h2><p id="8292">Let‚Äôs say we have three microservices. One for mining iron ore, one for smelting iron ore into iron plates, and one for producing iron gear wheels from these plates. We can chain these services with synchronous HTTP calls. Whenever our mining drill has new iron ore, it does a POST call on the smelting furnace, which in turn POSTs to the factory.</p><figure><figcaption>From left to right: mining, smelting and producing ‚Äî tightly coupled via synchronous communication</figcaption></figure><p id="c2d1">This setup served us well, until there was a power outage in the factory. The furnace‚Äôs HTTP calls failed, causing the mining drill‚Äôs calls to fail as well. We can implement <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">circuit breakers</a> and retries to prevent cascading failures and message loss, but at some point we‚Äôll have to stop trying, or we‚Äôll run out of memory.</p><figure><figcaption>Power outage at the factory</figcaption></figure><p id="b3c9">If only there was a way to decouple these microservices... This is, of course, where Kafka comes in. With Kafka, you can store streams of records in a fault-tolerant and durable way. In Kafka terminology, these streams are called <em>topics</em>.</p><figure><figcaption>Microservices decoupled by asynchronous messaging</figcaption></figure><p id="1cf3">With asynchronous topics between services, messages, or <em>records</em>, are buffered during peak loads, and when there is an outage. These buffers obviously have limited capacity, so let‚Äôs talk about scalability.</p><p id="4521">We can increase storage capacity and throughput by adding Kafka servers to the cluster. Another way is to increase disk size (for storage), or CPU and network speed (for throughput). Which of these options give you the best value for money is use-case specific, but buying <em>bigger </em>servers ‚Äî unlike buying <em>more</em> servers ‚Äî is subject to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">the law of diminishing returns</a>. Kafka‚Äôs capacity scales linearly with each node added, so that‚Äôs usually the way to go.</p><figure><figcaption>Vertical scaling ‚Äî a bigger, exponentially more expensive server</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>Horizontal scaling ‚Äî distribute the load over more servers</figcaption></figure><p id="cba8">To divide a topic between multiple servers, we need a way to split a topic into smaller substreams. These substreams are called <em>partitions.</em> Whenever a service <em>produces</em> a new record, this service gets to decide which partition the record should land on.</p><figure><figcaption>A wagon producing records, a partitioner that puts messages on the right partition, and a topic with four partitions.</figcaption></figure><p id="07ee">The <a href="https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/internals/DefaultPartitioner.java#L69" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">default <em>partitioner</em></a><em> </em>hashes the message key and modulos that over the number of partitions:</p><figure></figure><p id="44f4">That way messages with the same key always end up on the same partition.</p><p id="8c62">Note that messages are only guaranteed to be ordered within the context of a producer and partition. Records from multiple producers, or from a single producer on multiple partitions, can interleave.</p></div><div><p id="2577">Now that we know how messages are put onto topics, let‚Äôs see how they are <em>consumed</em>. When you start listening to a topic, by default the records from all partitions are routed to you. It‚Äôs common though, to have multiple instances of a microservice running at the same time to achieve higher throughput or availability. If they all start listening to the topic, each record gets processed by each instance, which is usually not what you want.</p><figure><figcaption>All microservice instances consume all messages</figcaption></figure><p id="cd25"><em>Consumer groups </em>allow you to evenly divide the partitions among multiple consumers. When a microservice instance joins the consumer group, Kafka will reassign some of the partitions to it. Likewise, when an instance crashes, or leaves the group for another reason, its partitions will be assigned to other instances. Kafka makes sure the partitions are always evenly divided among the consumers in each group.</p><figure><figcaption>A single consumer group with three consumers</figcaption></figure><p id="0525">If there‚Äôs a topic where the number of records per partition are skewed, you might be in trouble. An instance might not be able to keep up, because it was assigned the partition with many records, while other instances are idle. It‚Äôs up to you to make sure that there are no partitions that have vastly more records than others.</p><figure><figcaption>Messages are piling up on a hot partition</figcaption></figure><p id="6201">Each consumer keeps track of which records it has processed. Since records are processed in order, a simple <em>offset </em>is enough. Every once in a while (5 seconds by default), a consumer will <em>commit</em> its offset to Kafka<em>.</em></p><p id="f018">When a consumer leaves its group, its partitions are given to other consumer in the group. The new consumers will be able to start requesting records starting at the offset where the previous consumer stopped.</p><p id="e71a">It is possible that a record was processed, but not yet committed. You‚Äôll either have to start at the committed offset, or start processing new messages and skip everything that‚Äôs not yet processed. This is why Kafka can only guarantee that messages are delivered at least once, or at most once.</p></div><div><p id="e033">The analogy no longer really makes sense when we start duplicating data. With Kafka, we can process a single record multiple times. Multiple consumer groups can consume the same records. Topics can be stored with a <em>replication factor </em>of three for reliability. Topics can have a <em>retention period</em> after which records are deleted. All this is possible because data, unlike iron, can be duplicated easily.</p><p id="5d27">This is a good place to end this post. We‚Äôve covered all the major concepts of Kafka and you should have a general understanding of how Kafka works. Let‚Äôs wrap up with a short recap.</p><h2 id="d898">What we learned</h2><p id="f248">Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that stores records in a durable way through replicating records across multiple servers. Topics consist of partitions, that store records in order. Partitioners decide which records belong on which partitions. Consumer groups are optional, and help distribute partitions among consumers for scalability. Offsets are committed as checkpoints for when consumers crash.</p><p id="89e2">And that, in a nutshell, is how Kafka works.</p><p id="b734"><em>edit: Like how I teach?

  <p>Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Opill (norgestrel) tablet for nonprescription use to prevent pregnancy‚Äî the first daily oral contraceptive approved for use in the U.S. without a prescription. Approval of this progestin-only oral contraceptive pill provides an option for consumers to purchase oral contraceptive medicine without a prescription at drug stores, convenience stores and grocery stores, as well as online. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The timeline for availability and price of this nonprescription product is determined by the manufacturer. Other approved formulations and dosages of other oral contraceptives will remain available by prescription only.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>‚ÄúToday‚Äôs approval marks the first time a nonprescription daily oral contraceptive will be an available option for millions of people in the United States,‚Äù said Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., director of the FDA‚Äôs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ‚ÄúWhen used as directed, daily oral contraception is safe and is expected to be more effective than currently available nonprescription contraceptive methods in preventing unintended pregnancy.‚Äù</strong></p>

<p>Nonprescription availability of Opill may reduce barriers to access by allowing individuals to obtain an oral contraceptive without the need to first see a health care provider. Almost half of the 6.1 million pregnancies in the U.S. each year are unintended. Unintended pregnancies have been linked to negative maternal and perinatal outcomes, including reduced likelihood of receiving early prenatal care and increased risk of preterm delivery, with associated adverse neonatal, developmental and child health outcomes. Availability of nonprescription Opill may help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and their potential negative impacts.</p>

<p>The contraceptive efficacy of norgestrel was established with the original approval for prescription use in 1973. HRA Pharma <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-application-process-nonprescription-drugs/prescription-nonprescription-rx-otc-switches">applied</a> to switch norgestrel from a prescription to an over-the-counter product. For approval of a product for use in the nonprescription setting, the FDA requires that the <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2023/017031Orig1s041SumR.pdf">applicant demonstrate</a> that the product can be used by consumers safely and effectively, relying only on the nonprescription drug labeling without any assistance from a health care professional. Studies showed that consumer understanding of information on the Opill Drug Facts label was high overall and that a high proportion of consumers understood the label instructions, supporting their ability to properly use the drug when it is available as an over-the-counter product. When properly used, Opill is safe and effective.</p>

<p>Opill should be taken at the same time every day; adherence to daily use at the same time of day is important for the effectiveness of Opill. Using medications that interact with Opill can result in decreased efficacy of Opill or the other medication, or both, potentially resulting in unintended pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most common side effects of Opill include irregular bleeding, headaches, dizziness, nausea, increased appetite, abdominal pain, cramps or bloating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Opill should not be used by those who have or have ever had breast cancer. Consumers who have any other form of cancer should ask a doctor before use. Opill also should not be used together with another hormonal birth control product such as another oral contraceptive tablet, a vaginal ring, a contraceptive patch, a contraceptive implant, a contraceptive injection or an IUD (intra-uterine device).</p>

<p>Use of Opill may be associated with changes in vaginal bleeding patterns, such as irregular spotting and prolonged bleeding. Consumers should inform a health care provider if they develop repeated vaginal bleeding after sex, or prolonged episodes of bleeding or amenorrhea (absence of menstrual period). Individuals who miss two periods (or have missed a single period and have missed doses of Opill) or suspect they may be pregnant should take a pregnancy test. Consumers should discontinue Opill if pregnancy is confirmed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Opill is not for use as emergency contraception and does not prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex. Oral contraceptives do not protect against transmission of HIV, AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B and syphilis. Condoms should be used to prevent sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

<p>The FDA granted the approval to Laboratoire HRA Pharma, recently acquired by Perrigo Company plc.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/"> Extreme Programming
</a> (XP) challenges many of the common assumptions about
software development. Of these one of the most controversial is its
rejection of significant effort in up-front design, in favor of a more
evolutionary approach. To its detractors this is a return to "code and
fix" development - usually derided as hacking. To its fans it is often
seen as a rejection of design techniques (such as the UML),
principles and patterns. Don't worry about design, if you listen to
your code a good design will appear.</p>

<p>
I find myself at the center of this argument. Much of my career has
involved graphical design languages - the Unified Modeling
Language (UML) and its forerunners - and in patterns. Indeed I've
written books on both the UML and patterns.  Does my embrace of
XP mean I recant all of what I've written on these subjects, cleansing
my mind of all such counter-revolutionary notions?</p>

<p>
Well I'm not going to expect that I can leave you dangling on the
hook of dramatic tension. The short answer is no. The long answer
is the rest of this paper.</p>

<section id="PlannedAndEvolutionaryDesign">
<h2>Planned and Evolutionary Design</h2>

<p>
For this paper I'm going to describe two styles how design is done in
software development. Perhaps the most common is evolutionary
design. Essentially evolutionary design means that the design of the
system grows as the system is implemented. Design is part of the
programming processes and as the program evolves the design
changes.</p>

<p>
In its common usage, evolutionary design is a disaster. The design
ends up being the aggregation of a bunch of ad-hoc tactical
decisions, each of which makes the code harder to alter. In many
ways you might argue this is no design, certainly it usually leads to a
poor design. As Kent puts it, design is there to enable you to keep
changing the software easily in the long term. As design
deteriorates, so does your ability to make changes effectively. You
have the state of software entropy, over time the design gets worse
and worse. Not only does this make the software harder to change, it
also makes bugs both easier to breed and harder to find and safely
kill. This is the "code and fix" nightmare, where the bugs become
exponentially more expensive to fix as the project goes on.</p>

<p>
Planned Design is a counter to this, and contains a notion born from
other branches of engineering. If you want to build a doghouse, you
can just get some wood together and get a rough shape. However if
you want to build a skyscraper, you can't work that way - it'll just
collapse before you even get half way up. So you begin with
engineering drawings, done in an engineering office like the one my
wife works at in downtown Boston. As she does the design she
figures out all the issues, partly by mathematical analysis, but mostly
by using building codes. Building codes are rules about how you
design structures based on experience of what works (and some
underlying math). Once the design is done, then her engineering
company can hand the design off to another company that builds
it.</p>

<p>
Planned design in software should work the same way. Designers
think out the big issues in advance. They don't need to write code
because they aren't building the software, they are designing it. So
they can use a design technique like the UML that gets away from
some of the details of programming and allows the designers to work
at a more abstract level. Once the design is done they can hand it
off to a separate group (or even a separate company) to build. Since
the designers are thinking on a larger scale, they can avoid the series
of tactical decisions that lead to software entropy. The programmers
can follow the direction of the design and, providing they follow the
design, have a well built system</p>

<p>
Now the planned design approach has been around since the 70s,
and lots of people have used it. It is better in many ways than code
and fix evolutionary design. But it has some faults. The first fault is
that it's impossible to think through all the issues that you need to
deal with when you are programming. So it's inevitable that when
programming you will find things that question the design. However
if the designers are done, moved onto another project, what
happens? The programmers start coding around the design and
entropy sets in. Even if the designer isn't gone, it takes time to sort
out the design issues, change the drawings, and then alter the code.
There's usually a quicker fix and time pressure. Hence entropy
(again).</p>

<p>
Furthermore there's often a cultural problem. Designers are made
designers due to skill and experience, but they are so busy working
on designs they don't get much time to code any more. However the
tools and materials of software development change at a rapid rate.
When you no longer code not just can you miss out on changes that
occur with this technological flux, you also lose the respect of those
who do code.
</p>

<p>
This tension between builders and designers happens in building
too, but it's more intense in software. It's intense because there is a
key difference. In building there is a clearer division in skills between
those who design and those who build, but in software that's less the
case. Any programmer working in high design environments needs
to be very skilled. Skilled enough to question the designer's designs,
especially when the designer is less knowledgeable about the day to
day realities of the development platform.</p>

<p>
Now these issues could be fixed. Maybe we can deal with the human
tension. Maybe we can get designers skillful enough to deal with
most issues and have a process disciplined enough to change the
drawings. There's still another problem: changing requirements.
Changing requirements are the number one big issue that causes
headaches in software projects that I run into. </p>

<p>
One way to deal with changing requirements is to build flexibility
into the design so that you can easily change it as the requirements
change. However this requires insight into what kind of changes you
expect. A design can be planned to deal with areas of volatility, but
while that will help for foreseen requirements changes, it won't help
(and can hurt) for unforeseen changes. So you have to understand
the requirements well enough to separate the volatile areas, and my
observation is that this is very hard.</p>

<p>
Now some of these requirements problems are due to not
understanding requirements clearly enough. So a lot of people focus
on requirements engineering processes to get better requirements in
the hope that this will prevent the need to change the design later
on. But even this direction is one that may not lead to a cure. Many
unforeseen requirements changes occur due to changes in the
business. Those can't be prevented, however careful your
requirements engineering process.</p>

<p>
So all this makes planned design sound impossible. Certainly they
are big challenges. But I'm not inclined to claim that planned design
is worse than evolutionary design as it is most commonly practiced in
a "code and fix" manner. Indeed I prefer planned design to "code and
fix". However I'm aware of the problems of planned design and am
seeking a new direction.</p>
</section>

<section id="TheEnablingPracticesOfXp">
<h2>The Enabling Practices of XP</h2>

<p>
XP is controversial for many reasons, but one of the key red flags in
XP is that it advocates evolutionary design rather than planned
design. As we know, evolutionary design can't possibly work due to
ad hoc design decisions and software entropy.</p>

<p>
At the core of understanding this argument is the software change
curve. The change curve says that as the project runs, it becomes
exponentially more expensive to make changes. The change curve is
usually expressed in terms of phases "a change made in analysis for
$1 would cost thousands to fix in production". This is ironic as most
projects still work in an ad-hoc process that doesn't have an analysis
phase, but the exponentiation is still there. The exponential
change curve means that evolutionary design cannot possibly work.
It also conveys why planned design must be done carefully because
any mistakes in planned design face the same exponentiation.</p>

<p>
The fundamental assumption underlying XP is that it is possible to
flatten the change curve enough to make evolutionary design work.
This flattening is both enabled by XP and exploited by XP. This is
part of the coupling of the XP practices: specifically you can't do
those parts of XP that exploit the flattened curve without doing
those things that enable the flattening. This is a common source of
the controversy over XP. Many people criticize the exploitation
without understanding the enabling. Often the criticisms stem from
critics' own experience where they didn't do the enabling practices
that allow the exploiting practices to work. As a result they got
burned and when they see XP they remember the fire.
</p>

<p>
There are many parts to the enabling practices. At the core are the
practices of Testing, and Continuous Integration. Without the
safety provided by testing the rest of XP would be impossible.
Continuous Integration is necessary to keep the team in sync, so
that you can make a change and not be worried about integrating it
with other people. Together these practices can have a big effect on
the change curve. I was reminded of this again here at
Thoughtworks. Introducing testing and continuous integration had
a marked improvement on the development effort. Certainly enough
to seriously question the XP assertion that you need all the practices
to get a big improvement.</p>

<p>
Refactoring has a similar effect. People who refactor their code in
the disciplined manner suggested by XP find a significant difference
in their effectiveness compared to doing looser, more ad-hoc
restructuring. That was certainly my experience once Kent had
taught me to refactor properly. After all, only such a strong change
would have motivated me to write a whole book about it.</p>

<p>
 Jim Highsmith, in his excellent <a href="http://www.cutter.com/ead/ead0002.html">summary
 of XP</a>, uses the analogy of a set of scales. In one tray is
 planned design, the other is refactoring. In more traditional
 approaches planned design dominates because the assumption is
 that you can't change your mind later. As the cost of change lowers
 then you can do more of your design later as refactoring. Planned
 design does not go away completely, but there is now a balance of
 two design approaches to work with. For me it feels like that before
 refactoring I was doing all my design one-handed.</p>

<p>
These enabling practices of continuous integration, testing, and
refactoring, provide a new environment that makes evolutionary
design plausible. However one thing we haven't yet figured out is
where the balance point is. I'm sure that, despite the outside
impression, XP isn't just test, code, and refactor. There is room for
designing before coding. Some of this is before there is any coding,
most of it occurs in the iterations before coding for a particular task.
But there is a new balance between up-front design and refactoring.
</p>
</section>

<section id="TheValueOfSimplicity">
<h2>The Value of Simplicity</h2>

<p>
Two of the greatest rallying cries in XP are the slogans "Do the
Simplest Thing that Could Possibly Work" and "You Aren't Going to
Need It" (known as YAGNI). Both are manifestations of the XP
practice of Simple Design.</p>

<p>
The way YAGNI is usually described, it says that you shouldn't add
any code today which will only be used by feature that is needed
tomorrow. On the face of it this sounds simple. The issue comes with
such things as frameworks, reusable components, and flexible design.
Such things are complicated to build. You pay an extra up-front cost
to build them, in the expectation that you will gain back that cost
later. This idea of building flexibility up-front is seen as a key part of
effective software design.</p>

<p>
However XP's advice is that you not build flexible components and
frameworks for the first case that needs that functionality. Let these
structures grow as they are needed. If I want a Money class today
that handles addition but not multiplication then I build only
addition into the Money class. Even if I'm sure I'll need
multiplication in the next iteration, and understand how to do it
easily, and think it'll be really quick to do, I'll still leave it till that
next iteration.</p>

<p>
One reason for this is economic. If I have to do any work that's only
used for a feature that's needed tomorrow, that means I lose effort
from features that need to be done for this iteration. The release
plan says what needs to be worked on now, working on other things
in the future is contrary to the developers agreement with the
customer. There is a risk that this iteration's stories might not get
done. Even if this iteration's stories are not at risk it's up to the
customer to decide what extra work should be done - and that might
still not involve multiplication.</p>

<p>
This economic disincentive is compounded by the chance that we
may not get it right. However certain we may be about how this
function works, we can still get it wrong - especially since we don't
have detailed requirements yet. Working on the wrong solution
early is even more wasteful than working on the right solution early.
And the XPerts generally believe that we are much more likely to be
wrong than right (and I agree with that sentiment.)</p>

<p>
The second reason for simple design is that a complex design is more difficult to
understand than a simple design. Therefore any modification of the
system is made harder by added complexity. This adds a cost during
the period between when the more complicated design was added
and when it was needed.</p>

<p>
Now this advice strikes a lot of people as nonsense, and they are
right to think that. Right providing that you imagine the usual
development world where the enabling practices of XP aren't in
place. However when the balance between planned and
evolutionary design alters, then YAGNI becomes good practice (and
only then).</p>

<p>
So to summarize. You don't want to spend effort adding new
capability that won't be needed until a future iteration. And even if
the cost is zero, you still don't want to add it because it increases the cost
of modification even if it costs nothing to put in. However you can
only sensibly behave this way when you are using XP, or a similar
technique that lowers the cost of change.</p>
</section>

<section id="WhatOnEarthIsSimplicityAnyway">
<h2>What on Earth is Simplicity Anyway</h2>

<p>
So we want our code to be as simple as possible. That doesn't sound
like that's too hard to argue for, after all who wants to be
complicated? But of course this begs the question "what is simple?"
</p>

<p>
In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201616416/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201616416&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20">XPE</a> Kent gives four criteria
for a simple system. In order
(most important first):</p>

<ul>
<li>Runs all the Tests</li>

<li>No duplication</li>

<li>Reveals all the intention</li>

<li>Fewest number of classes or methods</li>
</ul>

<p>
Running all the tests is a pretty simple criterion. No duplication is
also pretty straightforward, although a lot of developers need
guidance on how to achieve it. The tricky one has to do with
revealing the intention. What exactly does that mean?</p>

<p>
The basic value here is clarity of code. XP places a high value on
code that is easily read. In XP "clever code" is a term of abuse. But
some people's intention revealing code is another's cleverness.</p>

<p>
In his XP 2000 paper, Josh Kerievsky points out a good example of
this. He looks at possibly the most public XP
code of all - <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/software.htm">JUnit</a>. JUnit uses
decorators to add optional
functionality to test cases, such things as concurrency
synchronization and batch set up code. By separating out this code
into decorators it allows the general code to be clearer than it
otherwise would be.</p>

<p>
But you have to ask yourself if the resulting code is really simple. For
me it is, but then I'm familiar with the Decorator pattern. But for
many that aren't it's quite complicated. Similarly JUnit uses
pluggable methods which I've noticed most people initially find
anything but clear. So might we conclude that JUnit's design is
simpler for experienced designers but more complicated for less
experienced people?</p>

<p>
I think that the focus on eliminating duplication, both with XP's
"Once and Only Once" and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=020161622X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20">
Pragmatic Programmer's</a> DRY
(Don't Repeat Yourself)  is one of those obvious
and wonderfully powerful pieces of good advice. Just following that
alone can take you a long way. But it isn't everything, and simplicity
is still a complicated thing to find.</p>

<p>
Recently I was involved in doing something that may well be
over-designed. It got refactored and some of the flexibility was
removed. But as one of the developers said "it's easier to refactor
over-design than it is to refactor no design." It's best to be a little
simpler than you need to be, but it isn't a disaster to be a little more
complex.</p>

<p>
The best advice I heard on all this came from Uncle Bob (Robert
Martin). His advice was not to get too hung up about what the
simplest design is. After all you can, should, and will refactor it later.
In the end the willingness to refactor is much more important than
knowing what the simplest thing is right away.</p>
</section>

<section id="DoesRefactoringViolateYagni">
<h2>Does Refactoring Violate YAGNI?</h2>

<p>
This topic came up on the XP mailing list recently, and it's worth
bringing out as we look at the role of design in XP.</p>

<p>
Basically the question starts with the point that refactoring takes
time but does not add function. Since the point of YAGNI is that
you are supposed to design for the present not for the future, is this a
violation?</p>

<p>
The point of YAGNI is that you don't add complexity that isn't
needed for the current stories. This is part of the practice of simple
design. Refactoring is needed to keep the design as simple as you
can, so you should refactor whenever you realize you can make
things simpler.</p>

<p>
Simple design both exploits XP practices and is also an enabling
practice. Only if you have testing, continuous integration, and
refactoring can you practice simple design effectively. But at the
same time keeping the design simple is essential to keeping the
change curve flat. Any unneeded complexity makes a system harder
to change in all directions except the one you anticipate with the
complex flexibility you put in. However people aren't good at
anticipating, so it's best to strive for simplicity. However people
won't get the simplest thing first time, so you need to refactor in
order get closer to the goal.</p>
</section>

<section id="PatternsAndXp">
<h2>Patterns and XP</h2>

<p>
The JUnit example leads me inevitably into bringing up patterns.
The relationship between patterns and XP is interesting, and it's a
common question. Joshua Kerievsky argues that patterns are
under-emphasized in XP and he makes the argument eloquently, so
I don't want to repeat that. But it's worth bearing in mind that for
many people patterns seem in conflict to XP.</p>

<p>
The essence of this argument is that patterns are often over-used.
The world is full of the legendary programmer, fresh off his first
reading of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201633612/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201633612&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20">GOF </a>who includes sixteen
patterns in 32 lines of code. I
remember one evening, fueled by a very nice single malt, running
through with Kent a paper to be called "Not Design Patterns: 23
cheap tricks" We were thinking of such things as use an if statement
rather than a strategy. The joke had a point, patterns are often
overused, but that doesn't make them a bad idea. The question is
how you use them.</p>

<p>
One theory of this is that the forces of simple design will lead you
into the patterns. Many refactorings do this explicitly, but even
without them by following the rules of simple design you will come up
with the patterns even if you don't know them already. This may be
true, but is it really the best way of doing it? Surely it's better if you
know roughly where you're going and have a book that can help you
through the issues instead of having to invent it all yourself. I
certainly still reach for GOF
whenever I feel a
pattern coming on. For me effective design argues that we need to
know the price of a pattern is worth paying - that's its own skill.
Similarly, as Joshua suggests, we need to be more familiar about how
to ease into a pattern gradually. In this regard XP treats the way we
use patterns differently to the way some people use them, but
certainly doesn't remove their value.</p>

<p>
But reading some of the mailing lists I get the distinct sense that
many people see XP as discouraging patterns, despite the irony that
most of the proponents of XP were leaders of the patterns
movement too. Is this because they have seen beyond patterns, or
because patterns are so embedded in their thinking that they no
longer realize it? I don't know the answers for others, but for me
patterns are still vitally important. XP may be a process for
development, but patterns are a backbone of design knowledge,
knowledge that is valuable whatever your process may be. Different
processes may use patterns in different ways. XP emphasizes both not
using a pattern until it's needed and evolving your way into a pattern
via a simple implementation. But patterns are still a key piece of
knowledge to acquire.</p>

<p>
My advice to XPers using patterns would be</p>

<ul>
<li>Invest time in learning about patterns</li>

<li>Concentrate on when to apply the pattern (not too early)
</li>

<li>Concentrate on how to implement the pattern in its
simplest form first, then add complexity later.</li>

<li>If you put a pattern in, and later realize that it isn't pulling
its weight - don't be afraid to take it out again.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I think XP should emphasize learning about patterns more. I'm not
sure how I would fit that into XP's practices, but I'm sure Kent can
come up with a way.</p>

<section id="GrowingAnArchitecture">
<h2>Growing an Architecture</h2>

<p>What do we mean by a software architecture? To me the term architecture conveys a notion of the core elements of the system, the pieces that are difficult to change. A foundation on which the rest must be built.
	</p>

<p>What role does an architecture play when you are using evolutionary design? Again XPs critics state that XP ignores architecture, that XP's route is to go to code fast and trust that refactoring that will solve all design issues. Interestingly they are right, and that may well be weakness. Certainly the most aggressive XPers - Kent Beck, Ron Jeffries, and Bob Martin - are putting more and more energy into avoiding any up front architectural design. Don't put in a database until you really know you'll need it. Work with files first and refactor the database in during a later iteration.
	</p>



<p>I'm known for being a cowardly XPer, and as such I have to disagree. I think there is a role for a broad starting point architecture. Such things as stating early on how to layer the application, how you'll interact with the database (if you need one), what approach to use to handle the web server. 
	</p>

<p>Essentially I think many of these areas are patterns that we've learned over the years. As your knowledge of patterns grows, you should have a reasonable first take at how to use them. However the key difference is that these early architectural decisions aren't expected to be set in stone, or rather the team knows that they may err in their early decisions, and should have the courage to fix them. Others have told the story of one project that, close to deployment, decided it didn't need EJB anymore and removed it from their system. It was a sizeable refactoring, it was done late, but the enabling practices made it not just possible, but worthwhile. 
	</p>

<p>How would this have worked the other way round. If you decided not to use EJB, would it be harder to add it later? Should you thus never start with EJB until you have tried things without and found it lacking? That's a question that involves many factors. Certainly working without a complex component increases simplicity and makes things go faster. However sometimes it's easier to rip out something like that than it is to put it in.
	</p>

<p>So my advice is to begin by assessing what the likely architecture is. If you see a large amount of data with multiple users, go ahead and use a database from day 1. If you see complex business logic, put in a domain model. However in deference to the gods of YAGNI, when in doubt err on the side of simplicity. Also be ready to simplify your architecture as soon as you see that part of the architecture isn't adding anything.

<section id="UmlAndXp">
<h2>UML and XP</h2>

<p>
Of all the questions I get about my involvement with XP one of the
biggest revolves around my association with the UML. Aren't the
two incompatible?</p>

<p>
There are a number of points of incompatibility. Certainly XP
de-emphasizes diagrams to a great extent. Although the official
position is along the lines of "use them if they are useful", there is a
strong subtext of "real XPers don't do diagrams". This is reinforced
by the fact that people like Kent aren't at all comfortable with
diagrams, indeed I've never seen Kent voluntarily draw a software
diagram in any fixed notation</p>

<p>
I think the issue comes from two separate causes. One is the fact
that some people find software diagrams helpful and some people
don't. The danger is that those who do think that those who don't
should do and vice-versa. Instead we should just accept that some
people will use diagrams and some won't.</p>

<p>
The other issue is that software diagrams tend to get associated with
a heavyweight process. Such processes spend a lot of time drawing
diagrams that don't help and can actually cause harm. So I think
that people should be advised how to use diagrams well and avoid
the traps, rather than the "only if you must (wimp)" message that
usually comes out of the XPerts.</p>

<p>
So here's my advice for using diagrams well.</p>

<p>
First keep in mind what you're drawing the diagrams for. The
primary value is communication. Effective communication means
selecting important things and neglecting the less important. This
selectivity is the key to using the UML well. Don't draw every class -
only the important ones. For each class, don't show every attribute
and operation - only the important ones. Don't draw sequence
diagrams for all use cases and scenarios - only... you get the picture.
A common problem with the common use of diagrams is that people
try to make them comprehensive. The code is the best source of
comprehensive information, as the code is the easiest thing to keep
in sync with the code. For diagrams comprehensiveness is the enemy
of comprehensibility.</p>

<p>
A common use of diagrams is to explore a design before you start
coding it. Often you get the impression that such activity is illegal in
XP, but that's not true. Many people say that when you have a sticky
task it's worth getting together to have a quick design session first.
However when you do such sessions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>keep them short</li>

<li>don't try to address all the details (just the important
ones)</li>

<li>treat the resulting design as a sketch, not as a final design
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The last point is worth expanding. When you do some up-front
design, you'll inevitably find that some aspects of the design are
wrong, and you only discover this when coding. That's not a problem
providing that you then change the design. The trouble comes when
people think the design is done, and then don't take the knowledge
they gained through the coding and run it back into the design.
</p>

<p>
Changing the design doesn't necessarily mean changing the
diagrams. It's perfectly reasonable to draw diagrams that help you
understand the design and then throw the diagrams away. Drawing
them helped, and that is enough to make them worthwhile. They
don't have to become permanent artifacts. The best UML diagrams
are not artifacts.</p>

<p>
A lot of XPers use CRC cards. That's not in conflict with UML. I use
a mix of CRC and UML all the time, using whichever technique is
most useful for the job at hand.</p>

<p>
Another use of UML diagrams is on-going documentation. In its
usual form this is a model residing on a case tool. The idea is that
keeping this documentation helps people work on the system. In
practice it often doesn't help at all.
</p>

<ul>
<li>it takes too long to keep the diagrams up to date, so they
fall out of sync with the code</li>

<li>they are hidden in a CASE tool or a thick binder, so nobody
looks at them</li>
</ul>

<p>
So the advice for on-going documentation runs from these observed
problems:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Only use diagrams that you can keep up to date without
noticeable pain</li>

<li>Put the diagrams where everyone can easily see them. I like
to post them on a wall. Encourage people to edit the wall copy with
a pen for simple changes.</li>

<li>Pay attention to whether people are using them, if not
throw them away.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The last aspect of using UML is for documentation in a handover
situation, such as when one group hands over to another. Here the XP
point is that producing documentation is a <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/UserStory.html">user story</a> like any other, and thus its
business value is determined by the customer. Again the UML is useful
here, providing the diagrams are selective to help communication.
Remember that the code is the repository of detailed information, the
diagrams act to summarize and highlight important issues.
</p>
</section>

<section id="OnMetaphor">
<h2>On Metaphor</h2>

<p>
Okay I might as well say it publicly - I still haven't got the hang of
this metaphor thing. I saw it work, and work well on the C3 project,
but it doesn't mean I have any idea how to do it, let alone how to
explain how to do it. </p>

<p>
The XP practice of Metaphor is built on Ward Cunninghams's
approach of a system of names. The point is that you come up with a
well known set of names that acts as a vocabulary to talk about the
domain. This system of names plays into the way you name the
classes and methods in the system</p>

<p>
I've built a system of names by building a conceptual model of the
domain. I've done this with the domain experts using UML or its
predecessors. I've found you have to be careful doing this. You need
to keep to a minimal simple set of notation, and you have to guard
against letting any technical issues creeping into the model. But if
you do this I've found that you can use this to build a vocabulary of
the domain that the domain experts can understand and use to
communicate with developers. The model doesn't match the class
designs perfectly, but it's enough to give a common vocabulary to
the whole domain.</p>

<p>
Now I don't see any reason why this vocabulary can't be a
metaphorical one, such as the C3 metaphor that turned payroll into
a factory assembly line. But I also don't see why basing your system of
names on the vocabulary of the domain is such a bad idea either.
Nor am I inclined to abandon a technique that works well for me in
getting the system of names.</p>

<p>
Often people criticize XP on the basis that you do need at least some
outline design of a system. XPers often respond with the answer
"that's the metaphor". But I still don't think I've seen metaphor
explained in a convincing manner. This is a real gap in XP, and one
that the XPers need to sort out. </p>

<section id="DoYouWannaBeAnArchitectWhenYouGrowUp">
<h2>Do you wanna be an Architect when you grow up?</h2>

<p>For much of the last decade, the term "software architect" has become popular. It's a term that is difficult personally for me to use. My wife is a structural engineer. The relationship between engineers and architects is ... interesting. My favorite was "architects are good for the three B's: bulbs, bushes, birds". The notion is that architects come up with all these pretty drawings, but it's the engineers who have to ensure that they actually can stand up. As a result I've avoided the term software architect, after all if my own wife can't treat me with professional respect what chance do I stand with anyone else?
	</p>

<p>In software, the term architect means many things. (In software any term means many things.) In general, however it conveys a certain gravitas, as in "I'm not just a mere programmer - I'm an architect". This may translate into "I'm an architect now - I'm too important to do any programming". The question then becomes one of whether separating yourself from the mundane programming effort is something you should do when you want to exercise technical leadership.
	</p>

<p>This question generates an enormous amount of emotion. I've seen people get very angry at the thought that they don't have a role any more as architects. "There is no place in XP for experienced architects" is often the cry I hear.
	</p>

<p>Much as in the role of design itself, I don't think it's the case that XP does not value experience or good design skills. Indeed many of the proponents of XP -  Kent Beck, Bob Martin, and of course Ward Cunningham - are those from whom I have learned much about what design is about. However it does mean that their role changes from what a lot of people see as a role of technical leadership.
	</p>

<p>As an example, I'll cite one of our technical leaders at Thoughtworks: Dave Rice. Dave has been through a few life-cycles and has assumed the unofficial mantle of technical lead on a fifty person project. His role as leader means spending a lot of time with all the programmers. He'll work with a programmer when they need help, he looks around to see who needs help. A significant sign is where he sits. As a long term ThoughtWorker, he could pretty well have any office he liked. He shared one for a while with Cara, the release manager. However in the last few months he moved out into the open bays where the programmers work (using the open "war room" style that XP favors.) This is important to him because this way he sees what's going on, and is available to lend a hand wherever it's needed.
	</p>

<p>Those who know XP will realize that I'm describing the explicit XP role of Coach. Indeed one of the several games with words that XP makes is that it calls the leading technical figure the "Coach". The meaning is clear: in XP technical leadership is shown by teaching the programmers and helping them make decisions. It's one that requires good people skills as well as good technical skills. Jack Bolles at XP 2000 commented that there is little room now for the lone master. Collaboration and teaching are keys to success.
	</p>

<p>At a conference dinner, Dave and I talked with a vocal opponent of XP. As we discussed what we did, the similarities in our approach were quite marked. We all liked adaptive, iterative development. Testing was important. So we were puzzled at the vehemence of his opposition. Then came his statement, along the lines of "the last thing I want is my programmers refactoring and monkeying around with the design". Now all was clear. The conceptual gulf was further explicated by Dave saying to me afterwards "if he doesn't trust his programmers why does he hire them?". In XP the most important thing the experienced developer can do is pass on as many skills as he can to the more junior developers. Instead of an architect who makes all the important decisions, you have a coach that teaches developers to make important decisions. As Ward Cunningham pointed out, by that he amplifies his skills, and adds more to a project than any lone hero can.
	</p>

<section id="Reversibility">
<h2>Reversibility</h2>

<p>At XP 2002 Enrico Zaninotto gave a fascinating talk that discussed
the tie-ins between agile methods and lean manufacturing. His view was
that one of the key aspects of both approaches was that they tackled
complexity by reducing the irreversibility in the process.</p>

<p>In this view one of the main source of complexity is the
irreversibility of decisions. If you can easily change your decisions,
this means it's less important to get them right - which makes your
life much simpler. The consequence for evolutionary design is that
designers need to think about how they can avoid irreversibility in
their decisions. Rather than trying to get the right decision now,
look for a way to either put off the decision until later (when you'll
have more information) or make the decision in such a way that you'll
be able to reverse it later on without too much difficulty. </p>

<p>This determination to support reversibility is one of the reasons
that agile methods put a lot of emphases on source code control
systems, and of putting everything into such a system. While this does
not guarantee reversibility, particularly for longed-lived decisions,
it does provide a foundation that gives confidence to a team, even if
it's rarely used.</p>

<p>Designing for reversibility also implies a process that makes
errors show up quickly. One of the values of iterative development is
that the rapid iterations allow customers to see a system as it grows,
and if a mistake is made in requirements it can be spotted and fixed
before the cost of fixing becomes prohibitive. This same rapid
spotting is also important for design. This means that you have to set
things up so that potential problem areas are rapidly tested to see
what issues arrive. It also means it's worth doing experiments to see
how hard future changes can be, even if you don't actually make the
real change now - effectively doing a throw-away prototype on a branch
of the system. Several teams have reporting trying out a future change
early in prototype mode to see how hard it would be.</p>
</section>

<section id="TheWillToDesign">
<h2>The Will to Design</h2>

<p>While I've concentrated a lot of technical practices in this
article, one thing that's too easy to leave out is the human
aspect. </p>

<p>In order to work, evolutionary design needs a force that
drives it to converge. This force can only come from people - somebody
on the team has to have the determination to ensure that the design
quality stays high.</p>

<p>This will does not have to come from everyone (although it's nice
if it does), usually just one or two people on the team take on the
responsibility of keeping the design whole. This is one of the tasks
that usually falls under the term 'architect'.</p>

<p>This responsibility means keeping a constant eye on the code base,
looking to see if any areas of it are getting messy, and then taking
rapid action to correct the problem before it gets out of control. The
keeper of the design doesn't have to be the one who fixes it - but
they do have to ensure that it gets fixed by somebody.</p>

<p>A lack of will to design seems to be a major reason why
evolutionary design can fail. Even if people are familiar with the
things I've talked about in this article, without that will design
won't take place.</p>
</section>

<section id="ThingsThatAreDifficultToRefactorIn">
<h2>Things that are difficult to refactor in</h2>

<p>Can we use refactoring to deal with all design decisions, or are there some issues that are so pervasive that they are difficult to add in later? At the moment, the XP orthodoxy is that all things are easy to add when you need them, so YAGNI always applies. I wonder if there are exceptions.  A good example of something that is controversial to add later is internationalization. Is this something which is such a pain to add later that you should start with it right away?
	</p>

<p>I could readily imagine that there are some things that would fall into this category. However the reality is that we still have very little data. If you have to add something, like internationalization, in later you're very conscious of the effort it takes to do so. You're less conscious of the effort it would actually have taken, week after week, to put it in and maintain it before it was actually needed. Also you 're less conscious of the fact that you may well have got it wrong, and thus needed to do some refactoring anyway.
	</p>

<p>Part of the justification of YAGNI is that many of these
	potential needs end up not being needed, or at least not in the way
	you'd expect. By not doing them, you'll save a good deal of
	effort. Although there will be effort required to refactor the
	simple solution into what you actually need, this refactoring is
	likely to be less work than building all the questionable features.
	</p>

<p>Another issue to bear in mind in this is whether you really know how to do it. If you've done internationalization several times, then you'll know the patterns you need to employ. As such you're more likely to get it right. Adding anticipatory structures is probably better if you're in that position, than if you're new to the problem. So my advice would be that if you do know how to do it, you're in a position to judge the costs of doing it now to doing it later. However if you've not done it before, not just are you not able to assess the costs well enough, you're also less likely to do it well. In which case you should add it later. If you do add it then, and find it painful, you'll probably be better off than you would have been had you added it early. Your team is more experienced, you know the domain better, and you understand the requirements better. Often in this position you look back at how easy it would have been with 20/20 hindsight. It may have been much harder to add it earlier than you think.
	</p>



<p>This also ties into the question about the ordering of stories. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201710919/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201710919&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20">Planning XP</a>, Kent and I openly indicated our disagreement. Kent is in favor of letting business value be the only factor in driving the ordering of the stories. After initial disagreement Ron Jeffries now agrees with this. I'm still unsure. I believe it is a balance between business value and technical risk. This would drive me to provide at least some internationalization early to mitigate this risk. However this is only true if internationalization was needed for the first release. Getting to a release as fast as possible is vitally important. Any additional complexity is worth doing after that first release if it isn't needed for the first release. The power of shipped, running code is enormous. It focuses customer attention, grows credibility, and is a massive source of learning. Do everything you can to bring that date closer. Even if it is more effort to add something after the first release, it is better to release sooner.
	</p>

<p>With any new technique it's natural that its advocates are unsure
of its boundary conditions. Most XPers have been told that
evolutionary design is impossible for a certain problem, only to
discover that it is indeed possible. That conquering of 'impossible'
situations leads to a confidence that all such situations can be
overcome. Of course you can't make such a generalization, but until
the XP community hits the boundaries and fails, we can never be sure
where these boundaries lie, and it's right to try and push beyond the
potential boundaries that others may see.</p>

<p>(A recent <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/continuousDesign.pdf">article</a> by Jim Shore discusses some situations,
including internationalization, where potential boundaries turned out
not to be barriers after all.)</p>
</section>

<section id="IsDesignHappening">
<h2>Is Design Happening?</h2>

<p>One of the difficulties of evolutionary design is that it's very
hard to tell if design is actually happening. The danger of
intermingling design with programming is that programming can happen
without design - this is the situation where Evolutionary Design
diverges and fails.</p>

<p>If you're in the development team, then you sense whether design is
happening by the quality of the code base. If the code base is getting
more complex and difficult to work with, there isn't enough design
getting done. But sadly this is a subjective viewpoint. We don't have
reliable metrics that can give us an objective view on design
quality.</p>

<p>If this lack of visibility is hard for technical people, it's far
more alarming for non-technical members of a team. If you're a manager
or customer how can you tell if the software is well designed? It
matters to you because poorly designed software will be more expensive
to modify in the future. There's no easy answer to this, but here are
a few hints.</p>

<ul>
<li>Listen to the technical people. If they are complaining about the
difficulty of making changes, then take such complaints seriously and
give them time to fix things.</li>

<li>Keep an eye on how much code is being thrown away. A project that
does healthy refactoring will be steadily deleting bad code. If
nothing's getting deleted then it's almost certainly a sign that there
isn't enough refactoring going on - which will lead to design
degradation. However like any metric this can be abused, the opinion
of good technical people trumps any metric, despite its subjectivity.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="SoIsDesignDead">
<h2>So is Design Dead?</h2>

<p>
Not by any means, but the nature of design has changed. XP design
looks for the following skills
</p>

<ul>
<li>A constant desire to keep code as clear and simple as
possible</li>

<li>Refactoring skills so you can confidently make
improvements whenever you see the need.</li>

<li>A good knowledge of patterns: not just the solutions but
also appreciating when to use them and how to evolve into them.
</li>

<li>Designing with an eye to future changes, knowing that decisions
taken now will have to be changed in the future.</li>

<li>Knowing how to communicate the design to the people
who need to understand it, using code, diagrams and above all:
conversation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
That's a fearsome selection of skills, but then being a good designer
has always been tough. XP doesn't really make it any easier, at least
not for me. But I think XP does give us a new way to think about
effective design because it has made evolutionary design a plausible
strategy again. And I'm a big fan of evolution - otherwise who knows
what I might be?</p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 13 Jul 2023 14:06:23 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/07/13/Rust-1.71.0.html">https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/07/13/Rust-1.71.0.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36709361">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.71.0. Rust is a programming language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.</p>
<p>If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, you can get 1.71.0 with:</p>
<pre><code>rustup update stable
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't have it already, you can <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html">get <code>rustup</code></a> from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/releases/tag/1.71.0">detailed release notes for 1.71.0</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>If you'd like to help us out by testing future releases, you might consider updating locally to use the beta channel (<code>rustup default beta</code>) or the nightly channel (<code>rustup default nightly</code>). Please <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/new/choose">report</a> any bugs you might come across!</p>
<h2>What's in 1.71.0 stable</h2>
<h3>C-unwind ABI</h3>
<p>1.71.0 stabilizes <code>C-unwind</code> (and other <code>-unwind</code> suffixed ABI variants<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>).</p>
<p>The behavior for unforced unwinding (the typical case) is specified in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2945-c-unwind-abi.md#abi-boundaries-and-unforced-unwinding">this
table from the RFC which proposed this feature</a>. To summarize:</p>
<p>Each ABI is mostly equivalent to the same ABI without <code>-unwind</code>, except that
with <code>-unwind</code> the behavior is defined to be safe when an unwinding operation
(<code>panic</code> or C++ style exception) crosses the ABI boundary. For <code>panic=unwind</code>,
this is a valid way to let exceptions from one language unwind the stack in
another language without terminating the process (as long as the exception is
caught in the same language from which it originated); for <code>panic=abort</code>, this
will typically abort the process immediately.</p>
<p>For this initial stabilization, <em>no change</em> is made to the existing ABIs (e.g.
<code>"C"</code>), and unwinding across them remains undefined behavior. A future Rust
release will amend these ABIs to match the behavior specified in the RFC as the
final part in stabilizing this feature (usually aborting at the boundary).
Users are encouraged to start using the new unwind ABI variants in their code
to remain future proof if they need to unwind across the ABI boundary.</p>
<h3>Debugger visualization attributes</h3>
<p>1.71.0 stabilizes support for a new attribute, <code>#[debug_visualizer(natvis_file = "...")]</code> and <code>#[debug_visualizer(gdb_script_file = "...")]</code>, which allows
embedding Natviz descriptions and GDB scripts into Rust libraries to
improve debugger output when inspecting data structures created by those
libraries. Rust itself has packaged similar scripts for some time for the
standard library, but this feature makes it possible for library authors to
provide a similar experience to end users.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/reference/attributes/debugger.html#the-debugger_visualizer-attribute">reference</a>
for details on usage.</p>
<h3>raw-dylib linking</h3>
<p>On Windows platforms, Rust now supports using functions from dynamic libraries without requiring those libraries to be available at build time, using the new <code>kind="raw-dylib‚Äù</code> option for <code>#[link]</code>.</p>
<p>This avoids requiring users to install those libraries (particularly difficult for cross-compilation), and avoids having to ship stub versions of libraries in crates to link against. This simplifies crates providing bindings to Windows libraries.</p>
<p>Rust also supports binding to symbols provided by DLLs by ordinal rather than named symbol, using the new <code>#[link_ordinal]</code> attribute.</p>
<h3>Upgrade to musl 1.2</h3>
<p>As <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/05/09/Updating-musl-targets.html">previously announced</a>,
Rust 1.71 updates the musl version to 1.2.3. Most users should not be affected by this change.</p>
<h3>Const-initialized thread locals</h3>
<p>Rust 1.59.0 stabilized <code>const</code> initialized thread local support in the standard
library, which allows for more optimal code generation. However, until now this
feature was missed in release notes and
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.thread_local.html">documentation</a>.
Note that this stabilization does not make <code>const { ... }</code> a valid expression
or syntax in other contexts; that is a separate and currently unstable
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76001">feature</a>.</p>
<pre><code>use std::cell::Cell;

thread_local! {

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Abdusemi was distracted. He had just been dealing with a young Uyghur man who tried to take his own life, and with another teenager who ran off halfway through drug rehab. He was frayed but resigned. This was a typical day. The psychologist who volunteered to help him shoulder the burden of supporting these ethnic minority kids fleeing China gave up three months into his term under the strain. Now Abdusemi was alone again.</p>
<p>Abdusemi Hoten runs a hostel in an Istanbul suburb where many of the city‚Äôs 50,000 Uyghurs settle, housing boys and young men who have fallen into drug and alcohol abuse and are seeking refuge from sleeping on the streets or in derelict buildings. He made mistakes himself after losing touch with his own family in 2016, and he feels called to rescue others from what so easily might have been his own fate.</p></div><div>
<p>He knows what they go through. News of his own family‚Äôs treatment by Chinese authorities shook him hard. His mother was taken to a so-called reeducation camp and his father was sentenced to five years in prison. He has had no news from either parent since. Penniless, Hoten‚Äôs life unraveled quickly. He ended up taking drugs and living rough until an uncle found him and gently guided him back. Now, in his mid-thirties, he is newly wed and in the final stages of a Ph.D.</p>
<p>The hostel survives from hand to mouth. Its original funders, the East Turkestan New Generation Movement Association in Istanbul, and the U.S.-based Campaign for Uyghurs, left Hoten to manage it on his own. His peppercorn salary from random handouts barely covers the rent, but his commitment to the cause is unwavering.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have tried to hand the project over, but no one wants to take it on,‚Äù Hoten told The China Project. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt feel like I do about these guys. If I don‚Äôt do this, who will help them?‚Äù</p>
<p>The donation in 2019 of a four-story apartment building by a well-wisher was just the start of Hoten‚Äôs efforts to assist the scores of young Uyghur males he found sleeping in the basements around Istanbul, high on the drugs Chinese traffickers scared them into peddling. In exchange for the dirty work, the young Uyghurs were promised that their families would be ‚Äúlooked after‚Äù back home in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf they refused, they were told their families would be harmed,‚Äù said Hoten, who frequently scours the neighborhood at night for kids sheltering on construction sites. ‚ÄúIn their vulnerable state, they were prepared to believe anything.‚Äù</p>
<p>The problems the Uyghur youths face are complex. Some as young as 14 became de facto orphans when the money their parents sent for their Turkish education dried up and the emotional rug was pulled from under them.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNot only were they left to fend for themselves, but they worried all the time about what was happening to their families,‚Äù Hoten said. ‚ÄúStories of child abductions, rape, and long prison sentences filled their days and nights. They felt lost.‚Äù</p>
<p>For an exiled Uyghur in Istanbul, success is difficult to measure. Facing the many who don‚Äôt make it every day, Hoten often is tempted to lose heart. Today, however, he basked in one of his triumphs. He had just received an invitation to the wedding of a former hostel resident.</p>
<p>Mewlan had come to Hoten hooked on cocaine. It had been a long and slow path to recovery. After three weeks in the ‚Äúcold turkey suite‚Äù at the top of their building, where residents sweat it out with pain killers as a last resort, Mewlan graduated to the third and then the second floor, each with more freedom. Every now and again, he relapsed and stole hostel equipment to get his next fix, but soon he would return contrite, ready to try again.</p>
<p>Hoten believed in Mewlan and always took him back. Finally, he was ready to be sent on a work placement, far from Istanbul and temptation, to a restaurant in Central Anatolia. He was billeted with a family in Kayseri, where a large community of Uyghurs flourishes. They helped to keep him on the straight and narrow. He met his Uyghur fianc√© there, and the rest is history.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis kind of success keeps me going and helps me feel like all those struggles were worth it,‚Äù Hoten said.</p>
<p>The hostel was almost at capacity with 36 residents going through a program of lectures, activities, English lessons, and work placement for those who were ready. Specialist medical and psychological help was called on regularly for pro-bono assistance.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe need is overwhelming,‚Äù Hoten said. ‚ÄúWe are a small outfit and need to expand, but I am one person and cannot do everything.‚Äù</p>
<p>Faced with his own limitations and a building whose crumbling masonry is an earthquake hazard, he fears for the future.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese problems are urgent and not going to go away. As the years go by waiting for news from home, the trauma is also increasing. These guys need more help than I can give them alone,‚Äù Hoten said. ‚ÄúWe need a reliable funding source and a new building or I cannot guarantee the future. We have many success stories like Mewlan. They are all worth helping.‚Äù</p>
<h3>Healing arts</h3>
<p>Samarjan Saidi, 34, runs a youth center in the heart of a conservative Uyghur suburb in Istanbul, not far from Hoten‚Äôs hostel. He, too, has seen Uyghur youth fall prey to cheap Chinese drugs and spiral down. He knows of two drug deaths and a couple of others who returned voluntarily to the Uyghur region, not able to face a future without their families, despite knowing that ‚Äúreeducation,‚Äù or worse, awaited them. They have not been heard from since.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHopelessness is the big mental health issue here,‚Äù Saidi told The China Project. ‚ÄúTheir future stretches unpredictably in front of them. Even if they have plans, there is no one by their side to help see them through.‚Äù</p>
<p>Saidi, born in the Uyghur region, was taken to Denmark at the age of 10 by his mother, who left Xinjiang to pursue a doctorate. His father and brother stayed behind and were marooned when Beijing began the clampdown on China‚Äôs Muslim minorities. Saidi became a Danish citizen and eventually trained as a civil engineer. Concern over the plight of those fleeing their homelands led him to abandon his career to work with refugees who landed in Denmark. For nine years, he ran a boxing gym catering to that growing community, but his hankering to return to his birthplace never left.</p>
<p>When a return to northwestern China became impossible, Saidi decided instead to travel to Turkey to help expose what China was doing to Uyghurs in Xinjiang. In Istanbul, he made himself available as a translator to international reporters interviewing the first wave of Uyghur refugees.</p>
<p>Saidi collated 2,500 witness accounts given by Uyghurs who escaped the roundups in China. Over three years, he processed an avalanche of interviews, translated countless testimonials, and coordinated recovery workshops.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe trauma of listening to all this every day was just too much,‚Äù Saidi said. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt take any more pain. I became stressed and depressed, and had to take a step back.‚Äù</p>
<p>He moved sideways, starting a kickboxing club for young Uyghurs. They met in a dark basement and, after expanding to tutoring English and math, his venue became a thriving hub. Funding became available to move aboveground and eventually they found a large, light, and airy floor of an office block, a beauty parlor abandoned during COVID. Three months later, painted and decorated, it was transformed into what initially was named the Palwan Youth Center. <em>Palwan</em> means ‚Äústrong man‚Äù in Uyghur. Artistic young Uyghur boys and girls piled in to assist in fixing it up and, wanting a softer feel, renamed it the Bostan Youth Center. <em>Bostan</em> means ‚Äúoasis.‚Äù The kickboxing club moved nearby and continues to be popular.</p>
<p>Saidi is full of ideas for courses and projects he‚Äôd like to pursue, but defers to the kids‚Äô leadership. There are 300 young Uyghurs registered with the center and, daily, about 30 regulars turn up to drink tea, chat, play cards, and watch movies together, discussing them afterward. Some practice guitar or the long-necked two-stringed lute called the dutar. Others pick up woodworking and movie-making skills in a workshop. Still others learn to create in the art studio.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre slow and deep. Not a quick fix,‚Äù said Saidi. ‚ÄúOur kids like to be secret, so there are no films or videos of them. They need to feel safe here.‚Äù</p>

<p>Their first group project was the ‚Äú<a href="https://www.codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/uyghur-students-open-genocide-experience-exhibition-in-istanbul/">Uyghur Genocide Museum</a>,‚Äù a multimedia simulation of detention camp conditions suffered by their relatives and friends in Xinjiang. It opened in Istanbul to local and international visitors for a week in November 2021, filling a series of spaces in the arched corridors of the East Turkistan Foundation with satellite images of internment camps, photos, news features, and their own artistic renderings inspired by reading survivor accounts given to the <a href="https://uyghurtribunal.com/">Uyghur Tribunal</a> in London in 2021. A central feature of the exhibition was a cold steel ‚ÄúTiger Chair,‚Äù to which prisoners are tied and forced to confess, and a table full of instruments of torture.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey wanted to show visitors that this is real and it is happening to people today,‚Äù Saidi said. ‚ÄúThey feel strongly that the world must know what is happening to their people.‚Äù</p>

</div>
<p>The Bostan Youth Center is manned by around 10 adult volunteers who come to hang out with the kids. Saidi is the only full-timer, paid sporadically whenever donations come in. They operate an informal mentoring scheme and look out for youngsters who are struggling.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe try to understand each kid ‚Äî who they are and where their interests lie,‚Äù Saidi said. ‚ÄúSome are very needy spiritually and emotionally. They have a lot of trauma and their situation is complicated.‚Äù</p>
<p>Young Uyghurs at the center often are matched with volunteers who have a psychology background.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt takes a while for those who come to build trust in a community where suspicion is rife,‚Äù Saidi said. ‚ÄúSome want help with practicalities such as making a study plan, others just want to come here to sit and listen. They don‚Äôt even want to talk. That‚Äôs fine with us, everyone is different.‚Äù</p>
<figure id="attachment_279000" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-279000"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://thechinaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image3-1.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1999" srcset="https://thechinaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image3-1.jpg 1500w, https://thechinaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image3-1-375x500.jpg 375w, https://thechinaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image3-1-900x1200.jpg 900w, https://thechinaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image3-1-768x1023.jpg 768w, https://thechinaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image3-1-1153x1536.jpg 1153w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-279000">Zuleyha, a volunteer art tutor, shows off Uyghur art produced at the Bostan Youth Center in Istanbul. Photo by Ruth Ingram.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Zuleyha, the center‚Äôs volunteer art tutor, is a fashion design student. She declined to share her surname. It‚Äôs her job to give a few basic techniques to the young people who come to her and let them find their own way. She loves being part of the community and the opportunity she has to bring out the best in members of the group.</p>
<p>Zuleyha said sometimes the kids just draw for the sake of it, and other times they work toward an exhibition.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is really exciting to see how they learn, increase in confidence, and develop their own style,‚Äù she said.</p>
<h3>Safe space</h3>
<p>Many Uyghurs at the center feel they have lost everything.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey hang onto their Uyghurness and their language,‚Äù said Saidi, stressing the importance of the center itself as a Uyghur-speaking space, where Uyghur festivals, community, hospitality, customs around tea, food, and traditional games are celebrated.</p>
<p>At the center, Saidi would love to develop the idea of Meshrep, a Uyghur communal event now banned in the homeland as a threat to Beijing‚Äôs idea of national unity. Beijing abolished the Uyghur evening gatherings of music and humorous attempts to keep the wayward in line, dishing out mock punishments to make a point.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Chinese government pushes the idea that being Uyghur is just about singing and dancing,‚Äù Saidi said. ‚ÄúThose who were brought up in the Uyghur region never had a chance to experience other aspects of our ancient culture.‚Äù</p>
<p>In the 1980s, worried that Meshrep would address youth disenfranchisement, unemployment, and religion, the Chinese Communist Party clamped down hard. The only so-called Meshrep today are eviscerated versions of the original: song-and-dance programs on Chinese state TV, or Uyghur culture festivals put on for Han Chinese or foreign tourists.</p>
<p>Saidi hopes a version of Meshrep will emerge from youth center life to encourage unity, leadership, team building, and promote the fun aspects of Uyghur culture and music. Keeping their culture pure is a challenge.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are living in a new country whose culture has elements of our own. There are bound to be overlaps and varying degrees of assimilation,‚Äù Saidi said, acknowledging the inevitability of intermarriage, no matter how great the desire to marry among Uyghurs. ‚ÄúSomehow, we must learn to keep our own culture alive, but realize that we will need to move forward, and might not be able to keep everything.‚Äù</p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 13 Jul 2023 13:37:21 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/ory/kratos/releases/tag/v1.0.0">https://github.com/ory/kratos/releases/tag/v1.0.0</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36708907">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true"><p>We are thrilled to announce Ory Kratos v1.0, the powerful Identity, User Management, and Authentication system! With this major update, Ory Kratos brings a host of enhancements and fixes that greatly improve the user experience and overall performance.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ory/kratos/assets/3372410/b84ed043-6e9b-4934-9f78-127345721bbf"><img src="https://github.com/ory/kratos/assets/3372410/b84ed043-6e9b-4934-9f78-127345721bbf" alt="ory-kratos-v1"></a></p>
<h2>Ory Kratos 1.0 is stable and robust</h2>

<p>Ory Kratos 1.0 introduces a variety of new features while focusing on stability, robustness, and improved performance. Major enhancements include support for social login and single-sign-on via OpenID connect in native apps, emails sent through HTTP rather than SMTP, and full compatibility with Ory Hydra v2.2.0. Users will also find multi-region support in the Ory Network for broader geographic reach, improved export functionality for all credential types, and enhanced session management with the introduction of the "provider ID" parameter. Other additions comprise distroless images for leaner resource utilization and faster deployment and support for the Lark OIDC provider.</p>
<h2>New features and full multi-region support in Ory Network</h2>
<p>Significant improvements and fixes accompany these new features. Enhanced OIDC flows now include the ability to forward prompt upstream parameters, offering developers increased flexibility and customization options. The logout flow also supports the <code>return_to</code> parameter, facilitating more flexible redirection post-user logout. Performance has been a key focus, with Ory Kratos 1.0 now capable of handling hundreds of millions of active users monthly. Critical bug fixes have been applied to prevent users from being redirected to incorrect destinations, ensuring smoother authentication and authorization. Additionally, there's more support for legacy systems via implemented crypt(3) hashers and a fix for metadata patching has been deployed to ensure consistent user metadata management. For a detailed view of all changes, refer to the changelog on GitHub. Feedback and support are, as always, greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>This change adds a new delivery method to the courier called <code>mailer</code>. Similar to SMS functionality it posts a templated Data model to a API endpoint.  This API can then send emails via a CRM or any other mechanism that it wants.</p>
<p><code>Mailer</code> still uses the existing email data models so any new email added will automatically be sent to the API/CRM as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/06/life-before-cell-phones-internet-after-work.html">In a recent article</a> written for <em>Slate</em>, journalist Dan Kois recounts the shock his younger coworkers expressed when they discovered that he had, earlier in his career, earned a master‚Äôs degree while working a full-time job. ‚ÄúIt was easy,‚Äù he explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúI worked at a literary agency during the day, I got off work at 5 p.m., and I studied at night. The key was that this was just after the turn of the millennium. ‚ÄòBut what would you do when you had work emails?‚Äô these coworkers asked. ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt get work emails,‚Äô I said. ‚ÄòI barely had the internet in my apartment.'‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In his article, Kois goes on to interview other members of Generation X about their lives in the early 2000s, before the arrival of smartphones or even widely available internet. They shared tales of coming home and just watching whatever show happened to be on TV (maybe ‚ÄúSeventh Heaven,‚Äù or ‚ÄúLaw and Order‚Äù). They also talked about going to the movies on a random weekday evening because they had nothing else to do, or just heading to a bar where they hoped to run into friends, and often would.</p>



<p>The threads that kept catching my attention, however, were about work communication. ‚ÄúThe very idea that, once work hours were over, no one could get hold of you‚Äîvia email, text, Slack, whatever‚Äîis completely alien to contemporary young people,‚Äù Kois explained. But this reality made a <em>huge</em> difference when it came to the perception of busyness and exhaustion. When work was done at work, and there was no chance of continuing your labors at home, your job didn‚Äôt seem nearly as all-consuming or onerous .</p>



<p>There‚Äôs a lot about early 2000s culture I‚Äôm not eager to excavate, but this idea of the constrained workday certainly seems worthy of nostalgia.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>DriveBC's Twitter account maxed out sharing crucial road condition information during a weekend of wildfire evacuations. Experts say it spells the end of social media as a reliable platform during an emergency.</p><div id="details-body" data-words="1143" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>A B.C. government Twitter account updating residents about driving conditions reached its tweet limit on a weekend it&nbsp;was sharing information about&nbsp;wildfire evacuations.</p>

<p>The incident, which occurred earlier this month, prompted the Ministry of Transportation‚Äôs DriveBC account to issue a warning.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHEADS UP - As many others have this weekend, <a href="https://twitter.com/DriveBC/status/1675600911782256640" target="_blank">@DriveBC</a> on Twitter and its sub accounts have exceeded the temporarily imposed post rate limit,‚Äù tweeted the ministry account July 2.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and appreciate your patience while we work to resolve this issue going forward.‚Äù</p>

<p>The outage, first reported by CBC News, lasted little more than an hour but nevertheless has worried emergency preparedness experts, who say it's the&nbsp;latest sign that the&nbsp;once-reliable platform can no longer be counted on.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt's kind of the end of public alerting through social media,‚Äù said Ryan Reynolds, an emergency preparedness consultant with Resilience Mapping Canada.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThese limits basically mean that we can't distribute that information quickly and easily at any scale.‚Äù</p>

<p>DriveBC has a dedicated <a href="https://drivebc.ca/" target="_blank">website</a>, but many access its automated messages through its Twitter account, a platform accessed by more than a quarter of Canadians in 2023, according to the company‚Äôs <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2023-canada" target="_blank">advertising data</a>.</p>

<p>In the past, Twitter‚Äôs more than 370 million&nbsp;users have accessed the platform&nbsp;as a last bastion of critical information during social upheavals and disaster. It played a crucial role redirecting Pakistanis to a Red Crescent emergency help line during massive floods in 2022, and amplified emergency service information when Hurricane Ian struck Florida last September.</p>

<p>Since Elon Musk‚Äôs takeover of the platform, however, Twitter has put new rules in place that limit the number of automated tweets an account can send without paying. The move was carried out partly as a response to rising concerns artificial intelligence platforms would use the historical archives of social media platforms to train their large language models.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe've been trying to use private infrastructure as public infrastructure for communications,‚Äù said Reynolds. ‚ÄúBut it really doesn't work once things change.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe need to acknowledge that we still want to be where everyone is (so on social media), but we also need fallbacks that are much more reliable.‚Äù</p>

<h3>Other jurisdictions feeling pinch of Twitter‚Äôs new limits</h3>

<p>B.C. is far from the first jurisdiction to feel the effects of recent tweet limits. The U.S. National Weather Service uses Twitter to share hurricane and tornado alerts. But on July 4, its Boulder, Colo., bureau tweeted that rate limits meant it was unable to sift through tweets during active severe weather events.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDue to issues with Twitter rate limits, we are unable to access most tweets at this time,‚Äù said NWS Boulder.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSend reports to our other social media accounts or direct through our email/phone lines.‚Äù</p>

<p>Similar warnings were posted to the weather service‚Äôs bureaus in <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSWilmingtonNC/status/1675570926350651392?s=20" target="_blank">North Carolina</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSWakefieldVA/status/1675258587206275073" target="_blank">Virginia</a>.</p>

<p>Some agencies have responded by cutting off their use of Twitter as a source of critical information. Last week, Dutch politicians told <a href="https://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/twitter-not-suited-emergency-communications-dutch-say/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> Twitter had become an unreliable platform after the Netherlands‚Äô most intense summer storm on record ripped through North Holland.</p>

<p>In New York, the <a href="https://new.mta.info/press-release/statement-mta-acting-chief-customer-shanifah-rieara-suspending-use-of-twitter-service" target="_blank">Metropolitan Transportation Authority</a> said in April it would suspend use of the platform for service alerts after it was twice locked out of the platform‚Äôs Application Programming Interface (API).</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe MTA has terminated posting service information to Twitter, effective immediately, as the reliability of the platform can no longer be guaranteed,‚Äù said North America‚Äôs largest transportation authority in a press release.</p>

<p>"The MTA does not pay tech platforms to publish service information and has built redundant tools that provide service alerts in real time.‚Äù</p>

<h3>Big disasters in big cities present&nbsp;largest risk</h3>

<p>Twitter‚Äôs API service limits tweets for non-paying users to 1,500 a month ‚Äî not enough for many emergency accounts. And while a&nbsp;small fee for the platform's 'Blue Check' service will increase that ceiling for individual users, the cost of an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/21/23691784/elon-musk-twitter-disaster-alert-accounts-fire-storm-tsunami-earthquake" target="_blank">enterprise account</a> has reportedly climbed into the tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Twitter did not respond to Glacier Media's questions.</p>

<p>Reynolds says Twitter's recent posting limits will likely have a limited effect on communication during emergency events in smaller communities, simply because they are less likely to send out as many tweets.</p>

<p>But he worries what might happen during a major disaster, such as a powerful earthquake striking large population centres in Metro Vancouver or the Capital Regional District on southern Vancouver Island.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFor a place like say Metro Vancouver, that's going to be a very different story, where you're seeing potentially very large number of messages going out during an emergency,‚Äù Reynolds said.</p>

<p>Like many government information services, <a href="https://drivebc.ca/" target="_blank">DriveBC</a> and the <a href="https://wildfiresituation.nrs.gov.bc.ca/map" target="_blank">BC Wildfire Service</a> share information on their own websites. But Reynolds worries whether such websites could handle the surge in traffic should a disaster occur in a major population centre.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat's the official way to get that message out,‚Äù he said of the websites. ‚ÄúIt has to be bulletproof and support that messaging, but I'm not convinced that that's the case right now. There aren't really good alternatives yet.‚Äù</p>

<p>A spokesperson from Metro Vancouver said it plans to use a number of communication platforms to inform residents in an emergency ‚Äî including the app <a href="https://alertable.ca/#/" target="_blank">Alertable</a>.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMetro Vancouver is active on social media, but doesn‚Äôt rely on any one platform or method to get important information out during an emergency,‚Äù said the spokesperson.</p>

<p>The B.C.'s Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure was not immediately available for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Government playing catch-up with 'tech bros'</h3>

<p>Reynolds says he's worried regional, provincial and federal governments aren't taking household disaster preparedness seriously enough.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A former researcher at the University of British Columbia, Reynolds led the development of an <a href="https://www.nsnews.com/highlights/disaster-app-helps-bc-communities-plan-for-climate-fallout-4695240" target="_blank">emergency app</a> to prepare and warn British Columbians of everything from floods to tsunamis and fires.</p>

<p>Initially rolled out in seven communities on Vancouver Island, Reynolds planned to scale up the app across B.C. But the province turned down two of his grant applications and he says the project, developed after years of community-level research, will become ‚Äúdead‚Äù unless&nbsp;Public Safety Canada picks it up.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat's a concern for me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need to have either a Canadian alerting app that is send only ‚Äî the part of Twitter that we need for emergency management ‚Äî or we need to reinforce the alternative approaches.‚Äù</p>

<p>Reynolds said that could come through partnering with the U.S. and Mexico or even NATO so Canada doesn‚Äôt have to ‚Äúreinvent the wheel.‚Äù</p>

<p>In the meantime, apps like <a href="https://www.alertready.ca/" target="_blank">Alert Ready</a> offer a good option to receive emergency alerts, but they have their limits when it comes to preparing households beforehand, said Reynolds.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe're losing these other passive solutions. We don't really have a great replacement for them right now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is just the privatization of social media, and the kind of balkanization of social media that we weren't anticipating.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúEmergency management moves at a much slower rate than tech bros.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="battalion">Battalion</h2>
<p><img src="https://cyber.dabamos.de/unix/x11/battalion.gif" alt="battalion" height="530" width="650"></p><p>Battalion is a 3D game from 1994, originally written for the Silicon Graphics
Indy UNIX workstation. The player controls a monster to blow up a city. The
author dedicated a
<a href="https://www.evl.uic.edu/aej/AndyBattalion.html">website</a> to the
game.</p>

<p>Depending on the perspective, the controls are a little awkward. You may
want to change the camera with key <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>,
<code>3</code>, or <code>4</code>. Use the mouse to rotate and to move
forward/backward. The arrow keys only work if the mouse cursor is placed in the
center of the screen. Shoot with the left control key or the left mouse button,
and tilt the head with <code>A</code> and <code>Z</code> to target helicopters
and jets. The camera can be rotated with <code>I</code>, <code>J</code>,
<code>K</code>, and <code>L</code>. Alter the rendering details with
<code>D</code>. Press <code>G</code> to grab the mouse cursor and
<code>P</code> to pause the game.</p>

<p>I made a quick &amp; dirty

<p>In a letter to the heads of <span><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/internal-revenue-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the IRS</a></span>, the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and the IRS watchdog, seven lawmakers say their findings ‚Äúreveal a shocking breach of taxpayer privacy by tax prep companies and by Big Tech firms.‚Äù </p><p>Their report said highly personal and financial information about sources of taxpayers‚Äô income, tax deductions and exemptions was made accessible to Meta as taxpayers used the tax software to prepare their taxes.</p>

<p>That data came to Meta through its Pixel code, which the tax firms installed on their websites to gather information on how to improve their own marketing campaigns. In exchange, Meta was able to access the data to write targeted algorithms for its own users. </p><p>The program collected information on taxpayers‚Äô filing status, income, refund amounts, names of dependents, approximate federal tax owed, which buttons were clicked on the tax preparers‚Äô websites and the names of text entry forms that the taxpayer navigated, the report states. </p><p>Taxpayer data was also shared with Google, through its own tracking tools ‚Äî though the firm told lawmakers that it never used the information to track users on the internet, according to the report. </p><p>The letter to federal agencies was signed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Ron Wyden, Richard Blumenthal, Tammy Duckworth, Bernie Sanders, Sheldon Whitehouse and Rep. Katie Porter. The lawmakers called for the agencies to ‚Äúimmediately open an investigation into this incident.‚Äù</p>
    

<p>They ask the agencies to investigate ‚Äúand prosecute any company or individuals who violated the law,‚Äù saying it could result in billions of dollars in criminal liability to the firms.</p><p>The Markup, a nonprofit journalism outlet focusing on technology, <span><a href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/11/22/tax-filing-websites-have-been-sending-users-financial-information-to-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initially reported</a></span> on the data-sharing between tax firms and Meta in November. A TaxAct representative said the firm has engaged with Warren‚Äôs office to explain its usage of the analytical tools and that protecting customers is its top priority. </p><p>A TaxSlayer representative said Wednesday that the report ‚Äúcontains numerous false or misleading statements‚Äù regarding the taxpayers‚Äô personal and filing information sent to Meta and Google and it will request a retraction or correction from Warren‚Äôs office. </p><p>H&amp;R Block said that it takes protecting client privacy very seriously and has taken steps to prevent the sharing of information through the Pixel coding.</p><p>And Meta said that it has been clear in its policies that advertisers ‚Äúshould not send sensitive information about people through our Business Tools.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúDoing so is against our policies and we educate advertisers on properly setting up Business tools to prevent this from occurring,‚Äù the company said in an emailed statement. ‚ÄúOur system is designed to filter out potentially sensitive data it is able to detect.‚Äù</p>
    

<p>Meta‚Äôs Facebook has a history of failure when it comes to protecting user privacy. </p><p>One of its <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/e0e0df2083fe40c0b0ad10ff1946f041" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest scandals erupted in 2018 when investigations revealed that Cambridge Analytica,</a></span> a firm with ties to Donald Trump‚Äôs onetime political strategist Steve Bannon, had paid a Facebook app developer for access to the personal information of about 87 million Facebook users. That data was then used to target U.S. voters during the 2016 campaign that culminated in Trump‚Äôs election as the 45th president.</p><p>Facebook agreed to a $725 million user settlement in that case, and later was <span><a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-7fa2c8a26b34436d89a1c7aff9914f70" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fined $5 billion</a></span> by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>This May, the FTC proposed <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/facebook-kids-messenger-ftc-privacy-children-6158aa59dee25c473e49f7df16f502ec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sweeping new changes</a></span> to its standing privacy order for Meta that would bar the company from using any data collected from children under 18, including via its virtual reality technologies. The new rules would also force Meta to pause new products and services until an independent assessor confirms that they comply with the FTC order. The under-18 concerns stem largely from Facebook‚Äôs Messenger for Kids app, which has long drawn fire for insufficient privacy protections for its younger users.</p><p>Also in 2018, the company disclosed that <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/65986276c04449ffb3e795ce0eef29d4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost 50 million accounts</a></span> had been vulnerable to the theft of digital ‚Äúuser tokens‚Äù that attackers could use to log into personal accounts. Facebook admitted the same year that most of its then 2.2 billion users had likely had their <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/4c5ee5ee573846b68e13e6c3a77b01bf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public data ‚Äúscraped‚Äù by malicious actors</a></span>.</p><p>Representatives from the IRS and FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. DOJ and the IRS watchdog declined to comment. </p>
    

<p>The Democrats say their report serves as an argument for the creation of <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/irs-income-tax-free-electronic-filing-option-700e54251a39791091966bc0b356d342" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an electronic free-file system</a></span> for submitting tax returns that would be run by the government, which the IRS is currently piloting. </p><p>The IRS plans to launch a pilot program for the 2024 filing season to test a ‚Äúdirect file‚Äù system and help the federal government decide whether to move forward with potentially implementing it in the future.</p><p>The IRS in May published <span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5788.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a feasibility report</a></span> laying out taxpayer interest in direct file, how the system could work, its potential cost, operational challenges and more.</p><p>The report shows that the majority of surveyed taxpayers would be interested in using an IRS-provided tool to prepare and file their taxes electronically ‚Äî almost 50% of respondents who preferred the IRS free-file option over commercial tax preparation firms said they preferred to give their financial information directly to the IRS instead of the third party. </p><h2>___</h2><p>AP writer David Hamilton in San Francisco contributed to this report. </p>
