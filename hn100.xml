<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Age-related brain atrophy, the gradual loss of neurons and shrinkage of brain tissue, is a natural part of aging, which can lead to cognitive decline and other neurological issues. While so far aging cannot be prevented, recent research from an 18-month dietary intervention offers hope that lifestyle and dietary changes can slow brain aging. A new international study, led by Ben-Gurion University of the Negev as part of the DIRECT PLUS Brain MRI trial, has brought to light how blood sugar control can significantly impact brain health.</p><p>Brain age, as evaluated by MRI measurements of the hippocampus and lateral ventricles, reflects the biological aging of the brain, which can differ from a person's chronological age. Chronological age is the number of years lived, while brain age indicates the brain's actual health. Typically, as we age, the hippocampus shrinks and the lateral ventricles expand, serving as markers of brain aging. Some individuals have a brain age younger or older than their chronological age. A younger brain age suggests better cognitive health, while an older brain age may indicate accelerated aging and increased risk of cognitive decline.</p><p>The study, which was published recently in <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916524007457" target="_blank"><em>The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2024</em></a>, was conducted by an international team of brain and nutrition experts, including researchers from Ben-Gurion University, Harvard University, Leipzig University, and more. The research was primarily carried out by PhD student Dafna Pachter and overseen by Prof. Iris Shai, along with several international collaborators.</p><p>A previous study published two years ago (<a rel="noopener" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35021194/" target="_blank"><em>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2022 </em></a><em>)</em>, reported that Mediterranean (MED) and green-MED diets significantly attenuated age-related brain atrophy by ∼50% within 18 months.</p><p>In the current study, the researchers aimed to understand the mechanism by which the slowing of brain atrophy occurs.</p><p>The study found that a decline in HbA1c, and key markers of long-term blood sugar levels, are associated with significant positive changes in specific brain regions commonly affected by age-related atrophy. Brain MRI results showed that lower HbA1c levels corresponded to greater deviations in the thalamus, caudate nucleus, and cerebellum – areas crucial for cognitive function, motor control, and sensory processing. The study suggests that improved blood sugar control could be one of the most important factors in slowing down age-related brain changes.</p><p><strong>The Green Mediterranean Diet Shows Promise</strong></p><p>Earlier research has highlighted the benefits of the Green Mediterranean (Green-Med) diet, including better blood sugar control. The Green-Med diet is rich in polyphenols from plant-based sources like Mankai (a high-protein aquatic plant) and green tea, while being low in red and processed meats. The current study further strengthens this connection by suggesting that the Green-Med diet may not only support metabolic health but also exert protective effects on brain structure and function.</p><p><strong>DIRECT PLUS Trial – One of the Largest Brain MRI intervention Studies in the World</strong></p><p>The DIRECT PLUS trial, one of the longest and largest brain MRI studies conducted to date, involved approximately 300 participants who were divided into three dietary groups. Whole-brain MRI measurements were taken before and after the 18-month trial to track changes in brain health. The researchers used Hippocampal Occupancy (HOC), as a proxy for brain age which predicts future risk of dementia. HOC typically decreases with age. Interestingly, some participants exhibited a brain age either younger or older than their chronological age.</p><p>Using NeuroQuant, an FDA-authorized fully automated tool, the research team quantified and segmented the brain MRI-derived data. The study aimed to examine whether improved glycemic control and specific dietary components could slow down brain aging. The results indicated that participants who managed to improve their blood sugar levels and achieve normal glucose status experienced a more pronounced attenuation of brain aging. Notably, those who consumed higher amounts of green tea and Mankai duckweed shakes demonstrated the most significant improvements in both blood sugar levels and brain health.</p><figure><img src="https://www.bgu.ac.il/media/raeewflp/iris_shai_ip.jpg" alt="" data-caption="Prof. Iris Shai | Photo: Dani Machlis"><figcaption>Prof. Iris Shai | Photo: Dani Machlis</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Glycemic Control and Polyphenols: The Key to a</strong><strong> Younger Brain Age?</strong></p><p>The study’s lead researcher, Prof. Iris Shai, from Ben-Gurion University, an adjunct professor at Harvard University, and an Honorary Professor at Leipzig University, explains, “Maintaining low blood sugar levels, even within the normal range, shows promise for preserving a younger brain, especially when combined with a healthy diet and regular physical activity. Specifically, polyphenols found in plant-based foods may cross the blood-brain barrier and help reduce brain inflammation, which is crucial for memory”.</p><figure><img src="https://www.bgu.ac.il/media/jkiddbja/dafna-pachter-ip.jpg" alt="" data-caption="Dafna Pachter | Photo: Courtesy"><figcaption>Dafna Pachter | Photo: Courtesy</figcaption></figure><p>Dafna Pachter, a PhD student and the first author of the paper, adds, "This trial offers a safe approach to potentially slow down our brain aging—by adopting the components of a green-Mediterranean diet."</p><p><strong>A Pathway to Reducing Age-Related Cognitive Decline</strong></p><p>This study is one of the first large-scale trials to directly link dietary changes, particularly those associated with the Green-Med diet, to improved glycemic control and slower brain aging. While further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms at play, these results suggest a potential avenue for reducing the risk of age-related cognitive decline through relatively simple dietary adjustments.</p><p>The DIRECT PLUS trial was funded by grants from the German Research Foundation (DFG), Israel Ministry of Health, Israel Ministry of Science and Technology, and the California Walnuts Commission. None of the funding providers were involved in any stage of the design, conduct, or analysis of the study, nor did they have access to the study results before publication.</p><p>The researchers: Dafna&nbsp;Pachter,&nbsp;Alon&nbsp;Kaplan,&nbsp;Gal&nbsp;Tsaban,&nbsp;Hila&nbsp;Zelicha,&nbsp;Anat Yaskolka&nbsp;Meir,&nbsp;Ehud&nbsp;Rinott,&nbsp;Gidon&nbsp;Levakov,&nbsp;Moti&nbsp;Salti,&nbsp;Yoram&nbsp;Yovell,&nbsp;Sebastian&nbsp;Huhn,&nbsp;Frauke&nbsp;Beyer,&nbsp;Veronica&nbsp;Witte,&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Kovacs,&nbsp;Martin&nbsp;von Bergen,&nbsp;Uta&nbsp;Ceglarek,&nbsp;Matthias&nbsp;Blüher,&nbsp;Michael&nbsp;Stumvoll,&nbsp;Frank B.&nbsp;Hu,&nbsp;Meir J.&nbsp;Stampfer,&nbsp;Alon&nbsp;Friedman,&nbsp;Ilan&nbsp;Shelef,&nbsp;Galia&nbsp;Avidan,&nbsp;and Iris&nbsp;Shai.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://wickedchicken.github.io/post/programmer-in-berlin-culture/">https://wickedchicken.github.io/post/programmer-in-berlin-culture/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42049180">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    <div> <p>This is part 4 of a <a href="https://wickedchicken.github.io/post/programmer-in-berlin/">5-part series</a> detailing what I wish I had known as an
American programmer moving to Berlin. This page details cultural differences and things I wasn’t aware of until I stumbled on them.</p>
<h2 id="politics">Politics</h2>
<p>One thing about Germany, and Europe in general, is that it’s relatively left-wing when
compared to the US. This is a
place where universal healthcare is so commonly accepted that no party – not even the
super-racist party! – is talking about removing it. The aforementioned super-racist
party has effectively the same political platform as the mainstream
Republican party in the US (minus the healthcare thing). Politics in Europe certainly has
its own problems, but at least in Germany there is a flourishing multi-party system that
allows for people to have some kind of choice when voting. There is even a fun website
called the “<a href="https://www.wahl-o-mat.de/"><em>Wahl-o-Mat</em></a>” (“Vote-o-Matic”) that tells you which party to vote
for after
answering a series of questions. There’s also none of the Electoral College
silliness, which I won’t get into here.</p>
<p>I think one weird aspect of living in Europe, or at least Germany, is that all the stuff
that US politicians told me were “too expensive” apparently aren’t!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gas prices are double or even triple what they are in the US. It’s ok, the economy isn’t
collapsing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Universal healthcare with an individual mandate apparently works. It’s ok, the economy
isn’t collapsing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trains, despite all the ineptness of Deutsche Bahn, are generally pretty good! For
many short-haul flights, such as Berlin to Munich, it’s actually quicker to go by
train than fly. It’s ok, the economy isn’t collapsing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Germany you get significant paid maternity and paternity leave<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
It’s ok, the economy isn’t collapsing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, some cultural things that are deemed a “slippery slope” in
the US aren’t:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Promoting Nazism is banned. It’s not a slippery slope, and the country hasn’t devolved into
authoritarian groupthink. You just can’t publicly support Nazism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no right to firearms in the way there is in the US. You don’t really have
school shootings out here, and society seems to be ok? Nobody seems to want to band
together to make a militia. Nobody in Germany is like, “we need more guns to prevent
government overreach.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not saying it’s perfect, and there’s plenty of criticism to be given to German
politicians and the EU as a whole, but I personally think it’s a more fair way of
governance.</p>
<h2 id="the-eu">The EU</h2>
<p>What is ironic about the general left-leaningness of Europe is that the EU’s structure
is similar to
what the “states rights!” people want – a coalition of states with relatively strong
political power and identities, working inside a relatively weak federal framework to
handle cooperation and disagreement. There is no EU military and only partially-dominant
EU money, but there is a
common justice framework, freedom of movement and a single market. To my limited
understanding, the EU is like if the US had no federal military but every state had its
own strong military, and Oklahoma spoke a different language and had different money than
everyone else<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I am not qualified to give a good assessment of the EU as a political organization, other
than I am very glad they gave me a visa and I wish they would streamline visa application
and acceptance for more people. What I can comment on, however, is my impressions of
Europeans’ relationship with the EU itself.</p>
<p>I would say that most Americans identify as “American” in some way, while most Europeans
identify with a country inside the EU. A friend once commented that they didn’t “feel
European” (as opposed to the country they were from) and didn’t know what “typical
European stuff” would be (top on the list, as enumerated by Americans: cheese, bread, and
trains). I think this speaks to a relationship with the EU somewhere between how Americans
view the US government and how the Americans view the UN. Nobody says “I’m from the UN” or
“I’m from one of the United Nations” when asked where they’re from, and Americans view the
UN as an organization to be navigated and negotiated with as opposed to something they are
inherently
part of. The EU certainly has more influence over Europeans’ daily lives than the UN does,
but it’s not part of the daily conversation as much as the US government is to Americans.</p>
<p>Digging into that relationship a bit deeper, there is also a bit more skepticism of the EU
than I expected when moving here. Brexit made this pretty clear from the right-wing side,
but some on the left view the EU as some kind of banker’s club where Germany and France
get to tell smaller countries what to do. You can see this in the “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Lexit">Lexit</a>” (crowd,
people
who wanted the UK to leave the EU so it could enact more socialist policies without being
hindered by the EU’s neoliberal slant. Another example is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis#Germany's_role_in_Greece">animosity countries had toward Germany after the eurozone crisis</a> – their
bailouts came attached with harsh
austerity requirements that were criticized as exploitative.</p>
<p>I personally think the EU is cool and wish it would remain a strong uniting force, but I
also can see how its incredible bureaucracy could be streamlined.</p>
<h2 id="crime">Crime</h2>
<p>I can’t speak to general crime rates, but in general Europe <em>feels</em> safer. The relative
lack of guns is refreshing, and (at least in Berlin) the crime centers around break-ins
and bike theft. I recall being in Copenhagen once, before I moved to Europe, and seeing a
woman walking by herself at 3 am. My first thought was concern for her safety, followed by
incredible shame in myself and my country – why did I think this was dangerous in the
first place? Of course, bad things happen all the time and I don’t want to claim Europe is
some kind of crime-free paradise, but it is striking how different it is compared to the
US.</p>
<h2 id="units">Units</h2>
<p>One small adjustment will be getting used to the metric system for everything. I recommend
not trying to do any conversions in your head and just see/feel the units themselves, but
occasionally having a reference point is useful.</p>
<p>Temperature: 0°C is water’s freezing point, 100°C is its boiling point. 37°C is a nominal
human body temperature. 16°C is light sweater weather, 20-22°C is a nice indoor
temperature depending on your preference, anything over 25°C is unpleasantly warm.</p>
<p>Weight: An average supermarket pineapple weighs roughly 1 kilogram! If you take away only
one fact from this article, let it be this one.</p>
<p>Distance: Meters are just yards, so that’s really easy. <em>Centimeters</em>, on the other hand,
are quite hard and I still don’t have a good feel for them. A kitchen planner once
laughed at me when I tried to mark 10 centimeters with my fingers. It’s a little
more than the
width of a credit card I guess? Around 4 inches? I also don’t have a good feel for
kilometers and can’t give many tips, sorry. A nice thing about miles is that people
roughly drive 60 miles per
hour over long distances, meaning a distance in miles roughly corresponds to how many minutes it will take to
drive there. Luckily people roughly drive 100km/h over long distances, meaning you can divide any distance
in kilometers by 100 and that’s roughly the number of hours it’ll take to drive there.</p>
<p>Volume: A cup is roughly 240mL, or 1/4L if you’re in a pinch. A gallon is roughly 4
liters. A liter is about half of a two-liter bottle<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, or roughly one quart.</p>
<p>A fun fact: one mL of water weighs one gram, which means one liter weighs one
kilogram. Pretty cool!</p>
<h2 id="washing">Washing</h2>
<p>Washing machines in Europe electrically heat their water, which means there is far more
precise temperature control than water taken from the building’s hot water supply. Instead
of “cold,” “warm” and “hot” you have 30°C, 40°C, and 60°C. Luckily clothing sold in Europe
tells you what temperature to wash it at on the tag.</p>
<p>Dryers are relatively uncommon in Germany, and most people hang their wash on a line to dry.
You can do this inside or outside, if the weather allows. Since fully soaked clothes would
take forever to dry, most people have front-loading washers which spin the water out
at the end of a cycle. The higher the RPM, the more water is taken out, but higher RPMs
also add more wear to your clothes. At 1400rpm, cotton and synthetic clothes usually dry
overnight, if not sooner. At 800rpm, it can take a day for things to dry.</p>
<p>I first got annoyed that dryers weren’t common, but I quickly adjusted and stopped caring.
Dryers use immense energy and wear down your clothes, and the added convenience isn’t
worth it unless you’re washing a LOT of clothes (which explains why it’s mostly families
who buy dryers). If you do get a dryer, get a heat pump dryer – they use roughly a third
of the energy of the standard dryers you find in the US (but you do have to empty the
water out afterward).</p>
<p>I disagree with this <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2011/04/on-the-superiority-of-american-domestic-appliances.html">Slate article</a>’s general premise and feel that
European appliances are generally of equal or better quality, but definitely appreciate the
hatred of inscrutable symbols on the appliances here. Devices from Bosch-Siemens are
especially bad in this regard:
I have a washing machine
that has <em>Pflegeleicht</em> (“easy care” or “permanent press”) and <em>Pflegeleicht Plus</em> modes.
The
manual has no explanation of what <em>Pflegeleicht Plus</em> means<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, and I
only found out via a
Youtube comment on a video showing it in operation<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. On the other
hand, the manual for my dryer has an entire section telling me what clothes I should dry
on low heat, but doesn’t tell me how to actually do that – I’ve been assuming this entire
time that it’s also <em>Pflegeleicht</em>, but that’s never actually explained. Sometimes you’ll
have a symbol pop up on the display that doesn’t appear in the manual at all, and you have
to scour the internet to figure it out what it means.</p>
<h2 id="weather">Weather</h2>
<p>People in Berlin like to complain about the perpetual gray weather and they’re completely
right. Seasonal affective disorder is very real, and it might be a good idea to look into
Vitamin D and light therapy lamps. One note: a lot of people buy cool-colored light bulbs
or a SAD lamp and use it like a regular light. To get the real effects of these
lamps, you need to get a real one and use it very close to your face for a long time! I
went with the complete nerd option: <a href="https://myluminette.com/">Luminette</a> lamp glasses, which I use
right as I wake up. You look like a <em>total idiot</em> wearing them, but I like them a
lot. I don’t have much beyond anecdotal evidence to show that they work, but it’s worth
looking at the instructions of any SAD lamp you might buy to see if you can follow its
recommended regiment. As an added bonus, they’re good for late sleepers who need to wake
up early and can help you
adjust to new time zones. There are other companies that make similar devices if you’re
interested. Take winters in Berlin seriously!</p>
<p>The real solution is to book a trip to Spain in February, but that isn’t an option for
everyone.</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-the-expat-bubble">Avoiding the “expat bubble”</h2>
<p>Moving to a different country raises a lot of questions about integration, maintaining
your identity, and what community you decide to cultivate. One thing that can be difficult
is keeping ties to your previous community without locking yourself into it. Delving into
the language is one way to prevent this. I think it’s also worthwhile to try and rely on
“expat services” sparingly. They’re great when starting out, but over time they reinforce
the lock-in you’ll have. Language goes a long way here, but it can also help to expand
your social network to people from the country you’re in.</p>
<p>Something you may also want to be aware of is what I call the  “expat tax,” where
companies specialize
in providing English-speaking services or advice but charge more for the service. It can
be hard to discern if you’re getting specialized advice tailored to your needs, or getting
fleeced. Most of the time it’s not a big deal, but occasionally it can end up being
quite costly. I know of a mortgage broker specializing in English-speaking clients who, at
least in one case, gave a worse deal than a German-speaking mortgage broker. Admittedly,
several factors could have caused that, but a slightly worse deal on a mortgage can add
up to a big amount in the long run. Don’t feel too bad if you rely on such services, or
expat groups or whatever – I’m just saying that accepting a reasonable amount of
discomfort at the beginning can yield benefits in the long run.</p>
<p>It’s also worth getting involved on a civic level where possible. Reading local news can
help as is watching/reading <em>Tagesschau</em>, the publicly funded German news organization.
I find it also helps to go on
tours and learn about the history of the place you’re in, not just because it’s
interesting but also to help better relate to the people around you.</p>
<h2 id="customer-service">Customer service</h2>
<p>A lot of people moving to Germany (and especially Berlin) experience shock when
interacting with the famous German concept of customer service. While usually written off
as “rude,” I think there’s a deeper cultural norm powering this. An <a href="https://text.npr.org/482443233">NPR story</a> on opening
the first McDonald’s in Russia sheds light on what is going on here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SPIEGEL: At that time in Russia, the relationship between customers and service providers
like cashiers or waiters was basically the opposite of the relationship set up in America.</p>
<p>CHEKALIN: Waiters were kind of above us. They were not serving us. We were kind of, like,
bothering them.</p>
<p>SPIEGEL: In Russia, the role of the customer was to please the waiter, not the other way
around. To understand this, you need to remember that in the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s, Russia
was a state-run economy plagued by severe shortages. There were shortages of bread, of
meat, toilet paper. And so anyone who had access to stuff - to goods or food - had a
tremendous amount of power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, customer service in Germany (especially eastern Germany) follows the rule that
<em>the person doesn’t really have to help you</em> and <em>you are being served at their behest.</em>
I’m not saying that this is pleasant or right, but it does explain a lot of what’s going
on. It also explains why “is there a manager I can talk to” isn’t really a move you can
pull. In the States it’s usually a dick move anyway but people do it assuming that the
customer service person will be afraid of repercussions. In Germany it doesn’t work very
well because there are few repercussions, and you aren’t respecting their authority.</p>
<p>A side-effect of a highly bureaucratic society is that exceptions can be extensively
documented and handled if the bureaucrat wants to do so. This means that front-line
customer service people often have the ability to break through the system a bit, assuming
they want to and that they know they can do it. It sucks that there is a lot of personal
discretion involved, but sometimes repeatedly mentioning or reminding someone that they
have the power to document an exception can go a long way.</p>
<h2 id="tipping">Tipping</h2>
<p>There are probably huge articles online explaining how to handle the much more relaxed
tipping rules in Germany. The nice thing to note is that there is no
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipped_wage">tipped wage</a> system like in the US and waitstaff must be paid at least
minimum wage regardless of tips. This means they’re not as dependent on tips to get by,
and conversely tipping isn’t as compulsory as it is in the States. The card payment
terminals which always prompt for a tip are a very recent introduction and make everyone
uncomfortable.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapp">WhatsApp</h2>
<p>Nearly everyone in Europe uses WhatsApp, to the point that you might be lightly socially
ostracized if you don’t. Telekom, which <em>runs its own SMS communication network</em>,
allows you to contact their support via WhatsApp because it is so dominant. This has been
a great boon to Facebook and its group of aggressive PMs who want to make sure all your
contact data is harvested.</p>
<p>When I first moved here, you could use WhatsApp without giving access to your contact
list: you could type in a number and directly chat with a person. Then an update came and
the app refused to run unless you gave access. After a while it worked again
without having to give access (I conspiratorially think that Apple
forced them via app store policy), but a strange bug would occur: you could type
in a number directly and try to text them, but they “weren’t on WhatsApp.” Give the app
full access to all your contacts, and suddenly you could text that person. “Weird.”</p>
<p>I am perennially pissed off about this and I hope everyone involved feels bad about
themselves.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/technology/apple-social-apps-contacts-change.html?unlocked_article_code=1.UE4.fNpw.42cXdoBmoRc-&amp;smid=url-share">hahahahahahahahaha</a>.</p>
<h2 id="buying-stuff-on-sundays">Buying stuff on Sundays</h2>
<p>One thing you might get frustrated about is the lack of supermarkets that are open on
Sundays. This is a cultural thing that is supposedly not based on religion, but come on,
of course it is. There are a few gray areas: in Berlin there are some corner stores which are
open on Sundays and
some which aren’t. I’ve heard there is an informal agreement between corner stores who want to
stay open, and they simply don’t report each other so the compliance office doesn’t
investigate. In any case, there are some businesses which are allowed to legally operate on Sundays:
supermarkets can stay open as long as they’re in a train station and are targeted towards
travelers, and florists can sell cut flowers but not flowers in a pot. For everything else,
you have to hope your local corner store bends the rules a bit.</p>
<p>I don’t have any specific guidelines on how to get used to it, other than to adopt the
northern European tradition of <em>preparing for winter</em>. In the old days, you had to make
sure you stored enough potatoes in your cellar to last the winter, otherwise your family
would starve. Germans have somehow kept this mentality into modern times, and you can
sense the panic when someone realizes they don’t have enough groceries to last into
Sunday. Plan ahead, make sure you always have enough potatoes on hand, and be thankful for
what I can imagine is the only advantage of this system: extremely quiet Sunday streets.</p>
<h2 id="smoking">Smoking</h2>
<p>One thing I found unusual was how many people regularly smoked in Europe. Due to a variety
of factors, smoking dropped precipitously in my generation in the US (only to have vaping
take hold in the subsequent generation). This didn’t seem to translate over to here, and
people of all ages smoke in a variety of contexts. I don’t think I’ll forget the time
where I was eating lunch at the office and a coworker was having a conversation with
me, maintaining eye contact, while simultaneously rolling a cigarette. You don’t see that
often in the US!</p>
<p>Supposedly smoking has been legislated out of most public spaces in most of Germany, but
the Berlin nightlife industry fought hard against the regulations when they were being
crafted. Many bars in Berlin are smoking bars, and some restaurants even have a designated
smoking section walled off from the rest of the tables. I guess that’s one of the few
downsides of universal healthcare.</p>
<h2 id="testde--verbraucherzentrale">test.de / Verbraucherzentrale</h2>
<p>If you’re looking for a Consumer Reports or Wirecutter-like site in Germany, I can
recommend <a href="https://www.test.de/">test.de</a> or the
<a href="https://www.verbraucherzentrale.de/"><em>Verbraucherzentrale</em> (“consumer center”)</a>. In addition to product
reviews, they also
have good explanations and overviews of common insurances, guides for planning major life
events, etc. You do, however, have to have a decent German reading level to take advantage
of it.</p>
<h2 id="writing-letters--buying-a-printer">Writing letters / Buying a printer</h2>
<p>This is slowly changing, but Germany is absolutely a paper-based society. Until very
recently, the only guaranteed easy way to cancel subscriptions (gym memberships,
newspapers,
etc) was to mail a letter to terminate the contract. While you might be able to get away
with printing stuff at work or at a local copy shop, it can often be worth it to get a
home printer. I have a cheap black and white laser printer which has performed beautifully
and hasn’t needed a lot of toner. You might also want to look into getting a scanner to
scan and send copies of signed documents, although there are many apps that use your
phone’s camera to do this. It will make your life way easier if you can scan multiple
pages and combine them into a single PDF, reducing image quality to an acceptable file
size along the way. The iOS Files app and MacOS Finder/Preview can do this natively, but
the process can be annoying and can result in extremely high-resolution files that may be
difficult to transfer. Adobe has a scanning app that requires you to upload to their
cloud-based service. Microsoft Lens seems to be a good sweet spot: local storage, can
easily make PDFs of a normal size, and free.</p>
<h3 id="printing-envelopes">Printing Envelopes</h3>
<p>It’s not immediately obvious, but most printers have variable-width paper trays and will
happily print on DL envelopes (<em>DIN-Lang</em>, the standard envelope size for folded A4
paper). This is
great for people with bad handwriting, but it
is also super nice when combined with prepaid postage.</p>
<p>Google Docs doesn’t have envelope sizes natively, but you can install extensions to do
this. I’ve been using Apple Pages to make letters. The key is to select “Envelope,” and
make sure that the page size is set to ‘Envelope DL’. I’m sure Microsoft Word has a
similar thing.</p>
<p>If you’ve bought postage online, just drop it into the word processor and print the
address, return address, and postage all in one go.</p>
<p>I always kept loading the envelopes into the printer the wrong way, so I ended up
writing a little reminder on a label and sticking it near the printer tray so I
wouldn’t mess up again.</p>
<h2 id="subscriptions">Subscriptions</h2>
<p>Germany really locks you into yearlong subscriptions, so watch out. Gym memberships, cell
phone contracts, newspaper subscriptions, etc often have a minimum subscription amount
(usually a year or two years) and make it difficult to cancel. The government has passed
a law to require
simple cancellation online, but if that doesn’t work you’re often best off writing a
letter stating you’d like to cancel. There are many templates for this you can find
on the internet, but note that if you cancel in the middle of the initial period you’ll
likely have to pay until the period ends. Thankfully the law has now changed and you
should be able to cancel on a monthly basis after the initial period.</p>
<h2 id="dating">Dating</h2>
<p>In general, dating works similar to how it does in the US, with a few exceptions. One is
that dating apps can have a different connotation than what you’re used to. Tinder in the
US morphed from a hook-up app to a general dating service, but Germany was behind a few
years on that. For years I avoided Bumble as “a thing only Americans used,” only to
discover
that a much broader section of the Berlin population used it. Just be open to differences
from what you’re used to.</p>
<p>One thing that is a bit weird is everyone having profiles in English. I’ve heard of
stories where two Germans with English profiles figure out they’re German and switch
mid-chat. I think this mainly speaks to Berlin having a lot of non-German speakers (and
certainly a lot of non-German speaking tourists), so English is sometimes easier to start
off with. All I’m saying is don’t worry too much about your own profile being in English,
and don’t read too much into it if someone texts you in English.</p>
<p>Pro-tip: mention your test.de subscription in your profile and watch the matches come in
like crazy.</p>
<h2 id="following-the-rules">Following “The Rules”</h2>
<p>A particularly cheesy joke I once heard goes “do you know why crime is so low in Germany?
Because it’s illegal.” The extent to which rules and signs are just <em>followed</em> here can be
startling to someone accustomed to a more relaxed culture. It’s like the concept of a
“victimless crime” doesn’t exist here: even if you jaywalk at night when there are no cars
in sight, you’re still breaking the rules and that is, in itself, an offense. There are
two effects here.</p>
<p>One is that everyone trusts that everyone else follows the rules. When I was learning to
drive here, my driving instructor chastised me for looking left too much when turning
right at a T intersection. I was worried about people coming from the left who couldn’t
see me or wouldn’t let me turn. My teacher’s response: due to the “right before left”
rule (explained later in the “Driving” section), they would have to stop for me and I
should just trust that. Apparently it’s not
enough to follow the rules, you’re also expected to trust that everyone else is as well.</p>
<p>Two is that “the rules” can take precedence over communication and relationships. Noise
complaints from neighbors are a good example here. If I hear someone making a lot of noise
in an apartment, I use that as a starting point for a conversation with them. Maybe they
didn’t know the noise carried that much, or maybe we can work out an agreement where most
of the noise can happen when I’m not home. Unfortunately, what often happens is some
variant of “is it before 7pm? Then I’m allowed to do whatever I want!” It’s also limiting
for the people who are used to that environment – maybe something is against the rules,
but the neighbors don’t care. Instead of asking, they simply state that it’s against the
rules and automatically assume rejection – again, there is no “victimless crime.”</p>
<p>This is usually one of the more negative aspects of German culture that people cite, and
I can’t say I disagree. I don’t have much advice on how to navigate it except to notice
what gets people really freaked out and try to avoid those offenses. These usually
fall under:</p>
<ul>
<li>Noise during designated quiet hours</li>
<li>Improperly disposing of trash (including not folding boxes in the recycling bin)</li>
<li>Blocking cars (blocking pedestrians or bicycles doesn’t receive the same outrage)</li>
<li>Not lining up properly (I also get mad at this)</li>
<li>Not staying far enough to the right in a bike lane, even if it’s really narrow and no normal person would want to pass you.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="real-shit-they-dont-want-you-to-know-about">Real shit “they” don’t want you to know about</h2>
<h3 id="worker-rep-on-the-board-_betriebsrat_">Worker rep on the board (<em>Betriebsrat</em>)</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betriebsrat"><em>Betriebsrat</em></a> is an elected “works council” made up of employees that must be consulted by
management on certain issues. Once a company gets large enough it must accommodate a works
council by law, so some see it as a way toward organized labor in a company.
A <em>Betriebsrat</em> doesn’t have the same power as a union, so it’s worth looking into what they
can and can’t do.</p>
<h3 id="_bildungsurlaub_"><em>Bildungsurlaub</em></h3>
<p>In most German states, you have the right to a “<em>Bildungsurlaub</em>.” This is paid vacation
you’re
allowed to take in conjunction with some kind of job or political training. It differs by
state, but in Berlin you get 5 working days each year which can also roll over,
allowing you take 10 days every two years.</p>
<p>You do have to pay for the class itself and any transportation or lodging.
There are almost always German classes available for this, and you’re
allowed to go anywhere there is a course available. I know a German who went to Vancouver
for two weeks to improve his English, and several of my English-speaking colleagues have
spent time in different parts of Germany improving their German. Of course, there’s
nothing preventing you from taking a German class in your city of residence, but sometimes
it’s nice to have a change of scenery.</p>
<h3 id="properly-opening-a-ritter-sport">Properly opening a Ritter Sport</h3>
<p>I opened Ritter Sports for years without knowing that you’re supposed to open them by
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SaFuKPX03U">“snapping” them at the seam</a>. This opens them in a way such that the seam can be
resealed, to save the rest for later.</p>
<h2 id="transport">Transport</h2>
<h3 id="public-transit">Public Transit</h3>
<p>Of all the lifestyle upgrades I can think of, universal healthcare and pervasive public
transit are the two huge benefits of moving to Europe. Sure, there are plenty of cars
on the streets, but it’s far easier to take a bus, tram, subway, or commuter rail to your
destination than it is in virtually all of the US. It’s not perfect, but in general the
BVG (the Berlin public transit operator) will generally get you to where you need to go,
at a relatively quick pace. Not all areas of the city have a good connection, though.</p>
<p>However be careful about the ticket system: you have to buy your ticket <em>before</em> you get
on the train. Plainclothes ticket checkers (who are not fondly looked upon)
will spring into action once the doors close, and I’ve known people who have gotten fines
for not buying their tickets quick enough. If this happens, make sure to ask for a receipt
– ticket checkers have been known to scare tourists into paying cash on the spot and
pocketing the money.</p>
<p>Some, but not all, employers offer a discounted monthly transit ticket called a
<em>Jobticket</em> which is probably
worth it if offered. See the <em>Deutschlandticket</em> section for more details.</p>
<p>Google and Apple maps generally have decent transit directions. The BVG and VBB (the
transit operator for the greater Berlin and Brandenburg area) apps also have pretty good
routing. Transit and Citymapper are useful here, but aren’t often used.</p>
<p>One peculiar annoyance of the transit system here is that it can often be difficult to
know what station you’re at. The S-Bahn is particularly egregious here, as the signage
inside the train is often broken and the signage at stations is unlit and very difficult
to see (even more so at night, when the glare on
the windows makes it impossible to look outside). The newer S-Bahn trains make it even
worse – when the doors are about to close and the beeping starts, the screens in the
train switch to
what train it is instead of the current station. This makes it impossible to know where
you are without looking outside. For people like me who read articles on the train and
only react
to the beeps, it can be very stressful to look up and not know if you’ve missed your
stop or not. Oftentimes, the quickest way to tell which S-Bahn stop you’re at is to pull
out your phone and see where you are on Maps.</p>
<h3 id="bicycle">Bicycle</h3>
<p>Berlin’s cycling infrastructure is getting better over time<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. In addition
to all the pop-up
bike lanes that appeared during the pandemic (which are being converted to permanent bike
lanes over time), the city is building a bike autobahn (bikeobahn?) to connect major parts
of the city. Cycling in Berlin is semi-accepted. It’s not as nice as Amsterdam or
Copenhagen, but it’s not as bad as anywhere in the US.</p>
<p>Certain areas of the city have relatively good infrastructure (Prenzlauer Berg, in
particular), while others don’t (Neukölln, Potsdamer Platz). When the infrastructure isn’t
good, cyclists are often crammed in with aggressive cars and the result isn’t pretty. I
don’t have good advice here other than to avoid the areas where possible. When it’s not
possible, I urge you to heed the words of a bike shop owner when I asked him how to turn
left on one of Berlin’s major thoroughfares: “do you want to assert your rights or do you
want to stay alive?” Getting a ticket for riding on the sidewalk (slowly, don’t be a jerk
and blow past pedestrians) isn’t so bad compared to dying, nor is it worth it to rush or
bend traffic laws on the road.</p>
<p>Speaking of traffic laws, you may want to read up on the <em>rechts vor links</em>
(“right before left”) rule which described in the driving section. It will
help explain why cars act strangely at 4-way intersections.</p>
<p>Regardless of how well built the cycling infrastructure in your neighborhood is, you will
always
encounter cycling’s second natural enemy behind cars: cobblestones (<em>Kopfsteinpflaster</em>).
These are purpose-built to ruin your day as a cyclist<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. In addition to causing
extreme vibration while riding, enough to kick you off your bike if you’re going at anything
resembling a normal speed,
they can be spaced just wide enough to catch your wheel and send you flying. I’d like to
give a special shoutout to the bike lanes which are interrupted by driveways that use
cobblestones <em>just for the bike lane</em> – a special treat for everyone who wants to get
flipped off of their bike. For some reason they seem to be specially chosen and laid to
maximize the chances of catching your wheel.</p>
<p>You can fight cobblestones with a two-pronged approach: avoidance and acceptance. To avoid
them, I recommend the Beeline app. You should probably buy a <a href="https://beeline.co/">Beeline</a> anyway
since it’s a
great device, but I think you can use the app without purchasing the device and it works
as a great cycling navigation aid throughout Berlin. While it doesn’t know about
cobblestones specifically, it does let users rate streets and the routing takes that into
account. For those who want more detailed information, the “Berlin by Bike” website and
app use exact street data to minimize cobblestones as much as possible. Unfortunately I
find both interfaces effectively unusable, so I never end up using these. Google Maps can
route for cyclists but it has no concept of cobblestones and minimal understanding of
bike lanes, so it <a href="https://www.golem.de/news/fahrradtour-als-google-maps-mich-mehrfach-fast-umgebracht-haette-2209-168001.html">often puts cyclists in unpleasant or outright dangerous situations</a>. To
accept cobblestones, you can get a bike with wide tires or underinflate your tires to
absorb the impact (but not too much, or you’ll get a pinch flat). Getting springy grip
tape or wearing cycling gloves can help your wrists too.</p>
<p>Bike theft is definitely a concern around here, but not as much as I recall in SF. I
always followed the advice to bring two U-locks, one for the front wheel and one for the
back wheel/frame. Virtually nobody here seems to do that, and the foldy “D-locks” are
quite common around here. While practical, they offer less security. I’d say the general
consensus is to have a less valuable bike + less effective locking instead of valuable
bike + more effective locking. Another thing to be aware of: some of the bike racks are
too wide or too weirdly designed to be able to lock your rear wheel and frame together
with one U-lock. It might be worthwhile to invest in locking wheel skewers instead of
quick releases so you can care a little less when only one lock fits.</p>
<p>For some reason, despite Berlin’s reputation as a laid-back city (nobody is really in a
rush here), everyone is super aggressive in cars and on bikes. In addition, you also have
people who buzz past you at
especially dangerous times (intersections when the light just turns green, right when a
huge truck is passing centimeters away instead of just waiting a few seconds, the insanely
narrow bike “lane” on the bridge at Warschauer Straße), and otherwise general weird
behavior.</p>
<p>I don’t want to seem too negative here: cycling in Berlin is a great way to get around,
it’s free once you buy the bike and is great for your health. In addition to daily travel,
cycling out to Brandenburg for a long weekend can be a great experience. In summer, it’s
very popular to bike out to one of Berlin or Brandenburg’s many lakes and chill out for
the day. <a href="https://www.komoot.com/">Komoot</a> is a nice way to plan out one of these trips if you don’t know
anyone who knows the way. Enjoy it!</p>
<p>Finally, while you may not be able to vote, you can help your city become a more
bike-friendly place. I’d recommend joining your local ADFC chapter (that would be
<a href="https://berlin.adfc.de/">ADFC-Berlin</a> for the Berliners), who petition for better bike lanes, better
protection of
cyclists, and overall encourage a more bike-friendly city. In Berlin they also organize
the ADFC <em>Sternfahrt</em> (“rally”), for those who want a tamer Critical Mass experience.</p>
<h3 id="regional-and-long-distance-trains">Regional and Long-distance Trains</h3>
<p>Germans love to complain about the Deutsche Bahn, and there’s plenty to complain about –
the general opinion is that it’s a corrupt organization that was affected by the same
privatization spree that created the Deutsche Post. Recent
<a href="https://www.zugfinder.net/en/stationboard-Berlin">dismal on-time performance</a> has
not helped this impression, and trying to understand exactly <em>why</em> DB has such structural
problems is a hobby in and of itself.</p>
<p>However, overall <em>there are trains</em> and <em>the trains actually run</em>. You can reasonably
traverse the country by train, and if you don’t mind paying a bit extra for a high-speed
train you can get from any big city to another in maybe 7 hours tops.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bahn has some confusing pricing for the uninitiated, so I’ll try to explain it
below.</p>
<h4 id="second-class-_flexpreis_">Second-class <em>Flexpreis</em></h4>
<p>The basic ticket is the second-class <em>Flexpreis</em> (“flexible-ticket price”) ticket. This kind
of ticket works like a
public-transit ticket: just like a subway or bus ticket, with a <em>Flexpreis</em> ticket you can
take any train that day to your destination. Also like a subway or bus ticket, there is no
seat reservation: it’s a free-for-all and you may get lucky or not depending on demand.
This also means that DB can’t fundamentally do capacity control for second class. They
try to predict demand and tell you on the website, but there’s nothing stopping 200 people
showing up to ride the same train and filling up all possible space in the car.</p>
<p>The flexibility makes this kind of ticket most useful for commuters who don’t know the
exact time they’ll take a train and don’t mind if they don’t get a seat, since it won’t be
that long of a ride anyway. Reserved seats can be purchased afterward if you settle on a
particular train and think it might be busy.</p>
<h4 id="second-class-_sparpreis_">Second-class <em>Sparpreis</em></h4>
<p>The second-class <em>Sparpreis</em> (“savings price”) ticket is exactly like the <em>Flexpreis</em> ticket
except you have to pick a specific train to ride on. This changes the ticket from a
public-transit style ticket (“take any train going that direction”) to something more like
flying: you have a specific train to catch and can’t substitute it with another one. The
upside is that <em>Sparpreis</em> tickets are usually much cheaper, depending on how busy the train
is and how far out in advance you buy it. A funny consequence of this pricing model is
that the <em>Sparpreis</em> starts cheap and rises to eventually match the cost of the_Flexpreis_
ticket – at which point you can just buy a <em>Flexpreis</em> ticket, since that lets you ride on
any train that day anyway.</p>
<p>Like <em>Flexpreis</em> tickets, second-class <em>Sparpreis</em> tickets also do not come with a seat
reservation. Unlike <em>Flexpreis</em> tickets, most people buying <em>Sparpreis</em> tickets are buying for
some kind of long-distance vacation or business trip. For some routes and times of day
it’s not worth reserving a seat since it will almost certainly be empty, but if you’re
wrong you’ll be standing in the aisle for 5 hours straight. Another annoyance is that the
seat you pick may be reserved for part of your journey, meaning you’ll have to shuffle
around and find another one. Finally, there are the “<em>ggf. freigeben</em>” seats.
<em>Ggf. freigeben</em> (German for “lol, you thought this would be easy?”) means that the
seat may or may not be reserved, and they don’t know due to technical reasons. If you sit
there, you’ll have to wait the entire ride to see if someone actually did reserve it or not.</p>
<p>After getting burned a few times, I’ve just committed to paying the extra few Euro to
always get a reserved seat. If you plan to save the cash, just be prepared to stand in the
aisle/vestibule or shift seats a lot.</p>
<h4 id="first-class">First-class</h4>
<p>First-class on a DB train isn’t like first-class on a plane: you get slightly more
legroom, and occasionally someone will take your food or drink
order so you don’t have to go to the dining car yourself. It used to be a better deal on
emptier trains since you used to get a free seat reservation included, which often made
a first-class ticket only a few more Euro than a second-class ticket with seat
reservation. Sadly seat reservations
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230613062354/https://www.bahn.de/info/kleiner-fahrplanwechsel-juni-23">are no longer included with first-class tickets anymore</a>.</p>
<h4 id="bahncard">BahnCard</h4>
<p>If you plan to do any regular traveling with DB, I highly recommend getting a BahnCard. A BahnCard
25 can rapidly pay for itself after a few trips. These are prepaid discount cards that
come in six major flavors:</p>
<ul>
<li>First- and second- class BahnCard 25</li>
<li>First- and second- class BahnCard 50</li>
<li>First- and second- class BahnCard 100</li>
</ul>
<p>The BahnCard 25 is what applies to most people – you get 25% off of the various kinds of
<em>Sparpreise</em>, sometimes including train travel outside of Germany. The first-class BahnCard
also gives you the 25% benefit on second-class tickets, but not the other way around, so
it only makes sense to have one and not both.</p>
<p>The BahnCard 50 makes the most sense for commuters who need the flexibility of a <em>Flexpreis</em>
ticket, it gives you 50% off of <em>Flexpreise</em> as well as 25% off of <em>Sparpreise</em>.</p>
<p>The BahnCard 100 is for high-rollers. It lets you ride <em>any</em> train on the system, although
you only get a certain number of free seat reservations to go along with it. I only know
of people who get BahnCard 100s through their work, similar to having a company car.</p>
<h4 id="49-euro-ticket--_deutschlandticket_">49 Euro Ticket / <em>Deutschlandticket</em></h4>
<p>This is a relatively new offering that was originally introduced in 2022 during the
outbreak of the Russian invasion of Ukraine to reduce German’s reliance on fossil fuels.
Its success led to the current version with a higher price but more sustainable funding
from the government. The <em>Deutschlandticket</em> allows you to ride any regional, non-high-speed
train, as well as public transit in any city, in all of Germany for €49 a month. This
means you can ride from your apartment to the train station in Berlin using Berlin public
transit, a regional train from Berlin to Hamburg, and Hamburg public transit to your
hotel, all on the same ticket, which costs €49 a month. This is not only a great deal, but
an impressive achievement that they managed to unify the transit networks of every city in Germany. As you
can imagine, many people now opt for the <em>Deutschlandticket</em> instead of single-city subscriptions. You buy it through your local transit
agency, and there are even <em>Jobticket</em> variants you get through your employer that cost a little less.</p>
<p>A small caveat: the <em>Deutschlandticket</em> counts as a second-class ticket on regional trains,
and can’t be combined with a first-class “upgrade” ticket. If you want to ride first-class
on a regional train, you need to pay the full price. Additionally, there are no refunds if
a train gets canceled or delayed. If you are planning on using the <em>Deutschlandticket</em> to
catch a <em>Sparpreis</em> express train somewhere else, it’s probably better to buy a ticket for the whole
journey so you can be rerouted or reimbursed if something goes wrong.</p>
<h4 id="booking">Booking</h4>
<p>Booking trains within Germany is pretty easy – just go to the DB website. Booking trains
to neighboring countries through DB is also generally pretty good. Unfortunately, there is
no unified European train search and booking system, and the accuracy and bookability of
train search falls off steeply as you go further away from Germany. <a href="https://www.omio.com/">Omio</a> provides a
Europe-wide train search in theory, but it’s not as good as Google Flights, Kayak, etc.
Seems like a great opportunity for a scrappy startup to build something!</p>
<p>Sometimes you might get cheaper prices or different conditions if you book trips through
the Austrian rail line (<em>ÖBB</em>) instead of DB.</p>
<p>For longer-distance trips, <a href="https://www.rome2rio.com/">Rome2Rio</a> can provide some good connections that you might not
otherwise think about. There is also <a href="https://www.blablacar.com/">BlaBlaCar</a> which helps you organize long-distance
carpools, but I haven’t used it.</p>
<h3 id="driving">Driving</h3>
<p>I recently got my German driver’s license after converting it from a California one.
Unfortunately California doesn’t offer an exchange with Germany, so I had to go through
almost the whole driving school process here. Exchanging my license meant I needed fewer
required driving hours, didn’t have to do any “special” driving hours (like night driving
or Autobahn driving), and it meant that I could skip any theory classes as long as I
tested ok. Note that the exchanged license only has to be valid when you make the initial
application – if your license expires between the application and when you pass your
exams, everything should still be ok as long as the application itself is valid. If you’re
thinking about exchanging your license, do it while you still can.</p>
<p>An exchanged California license, assuming you don’t need too many practice driving hours,
will cost you roughly €1500 - €2000. That’s the school fees, the fees to use their
“learning platform” (an app to go through all the theoretical exam questions), some
administrative fees they charge whenever they talk to the license office or sign you up for a test,
and the practice driving hours. To help you estimate, I needed about 11 practice hours
in total, at a rate of about €80/hr. The schools aggressively hide their fees online, but
usually if you ask or sign up they have a published fee sheet somewhere.</p>
<p>I went to the license office to directly apply for the exchange, but I think that was really
the wrong order. I had to supply a driving school and test location, so I think the proper
order would have been to sign up with a driving school first. From what I understand, most
if not all schools will handle all the license office paperwork themselves (with an implied fee, of
course).</p>
<p>I had to take the theoretical and practical exam, as if I had never driven before. The
practical was relatively straightforward, but I recommend reading up on Reddit to avoid
common pitfalls. I found practicing for the theoretical exam way harder. The wording of
all the questions is quite tricky, so even if your German is passable it might be better
to take the exam in English, even though the translations aren’t great.</p>
<p>Finally, there are two things I’d want to stress when learning to drive: right-before-left
and where the speed limit signs are.</p>
<h4 id="right-before-left">Right before left</h4>
<p>This is a rule that, as far as I can tell, only exists in Germany and the Netherlands. In the US, there is the
concept of a 4-way stop sign at an intersection. Germany doesn’t have that. At a 4-way
intersection without a traffic light, the <em>rechts vor links</em> (“right before left”) rule applies: you have to
yield to everyone to the right of you. Before you go “oh yeah, that makes sense” I almost
assure you that you don’t understand it. There is no cycling of cars as people take turns,
literally everyone to the right of you goes ahead while you wait, and only when the right
is clear do you go (the people left of you are waiting on you). Imagine that every
intersection had a default sign that said “yield to all cars on the right.”</p>
<p>This rule applies basically everywhere there aren’t traffic signs, not just at 4-way
stops. If there is a road to the
right of you, you have to slow down to see if anyone is coming and yield if anyone is
there. The only exceptions are if it’s a “road with a curb” (meaning a driveway), a
lesser class of road (a dirt road when you’re on a paved one), or if you have a street
sign telling you have right of way or are on a “priority road” (the most common being a
yellow diamond inside a white diamond). This means that in a parking lot, if someone is
arriving to the right of you, you have to yield.</p>
<p>It’s complicated enough driving through the city trying to figure out if the road to the
right of you is a real road or a driveway, but there’s another curveball thrown into the
mix: the sign that tells you that the priority road curves right or left. Usually in these
scenarios I stop my car and write a Prolog program to solve the logic puzzle of
what to do, especially if you want to turn left into oncoming traffic. One nice
shortcut: if you’re on a priority road that curves left, you always have right-of-way no
matter what you’re doing.</p>
<h4 id="where-the-speed-limit-signs-are">Where the speed limit signs are</h4>
<p>This seems trivial, but I found it very frustrating while driving around town. In Germany,
the speed limit signs are posted directly <em>at</em> the intersection, and not after.
Additionally, there is a default speed limit if you <em>don’t</em> see any sign (50km/h within
cities, 100km/h outside). Since I’m usually looking at pedestrians and other cars when
turning at an intersection, I kept missing traffic signs when I was first learning to
drive here. While you’re walking on the street (meaning, in a non-stressful situation),
keep an eye out for them to see where they should be.</p>
<p>Be sure to note the change in default speed limit I mentioned above. Make a mental note
that <em>every</em> time you see a “welcome to X city” sign, you slow down to 50km/h.</p>
<p>Finally, speed limit signs on some roads can be on the <em>left</em> side of the road as well
as on the right – these can be more difficult to see on wider streets, so try to
keep an eye out for them.</p>
<h2 id="medical">Medical</h2>
<p>The medical system in Germany is good, regardless of whether you have public or private
health insurance. In general it helps to know German to navigate the system, but a few
tips can make it a bit easier.</p>
<h3 id="emergencies">Emergencies</h3>
<p>If you have a medical emergency, dial 112 and get an ambulance – make sure to state the
street address first, so if the call gets cut off they still know where to go. The number
to call the police in emergencies is 110. I struggled for a while to remember which was
which – 110 or 112 – until I saw a cheesy poster for a fire brigade’s recreational
rowing team: “We give 112 percent!” It took me a second, like “oh god, 110% isn’t good
enough?” followed by “oohhhhhh.”</p>
<h3 id="getting-an-appointment">Getting an appointment</h3>
<p>With public insurance, it can be hard to find an appointment for your doctor. Some of them
only make appointments by phone, but a growing number schedule patients online via
companies like Doctolib,
Jameda, or Samedi. For specialists it may not be a big deal, but I really recommend
finding a <em>Hausarzt</em> (“primary care physician”) that reliably schedules appointments
online. Some health insurances
offer appointment-making services (Techniker Krankenkassse, for example, has an English
language appointment
hotline), but I don’t have much experience with that.</p>
<p>One bright spot is that you often don’t have to make an appointment to refill a
prescription – usually you can call the doctor’s office, ask for a refill, and you can
pick the prescription up when convenient. Sometimes they’ll even mail it to you!</p>
<h3 id="krankschriebung">Krankschriebung</h3>
<p>With most non-freelancer jobs, if you get sick you’re allowed to take off work for a few
days, but on the third day you’re required to go to a <em>Hausarzt</em> and get
<em>krankgeschrieben</em> (“written off sick”). That process
itself is kind of annoying – most practices won’t give them out over the phone, so you
usually have to go in person while having a cold, just to get a piece of paper saying you
have a cold. At least it’s better than being forced to work while sick. There is
no concept of a fixed amount of “sick days” here and Germans are appalled at the concept.</p>
<h3 id="_überweisungen_"><em>Überweisungen</em></h3>
<p>In the German healthcare system, the <em>Hausarzt</em> is the
gatekeeper for basically all your medical needs. Unless it’s an emergency, you usually
have to see the <em>Hausarzt</em> first before seeing any kind of specialist. The magical
document you need to see a specialist is the <em>Überweisung</em> (“referral”). This is why I
recommended in the previous section that you should really try to find a <em>Hausarzt</em> that’s
easy to book appointments with.</p>
<p>The setup can get a little frustrating at times, since you’re just making an appointment
to get permission to make a different appointment with someone else. It’s also a little
weird because, in theory, you can go to any <em>Hausarzt</em> to do this, not just your main one
(although you may get funny looks if you show up to a new practice with an unusual
request).</p>
<h3 id="rezepte">Rezepte</h3>
<p>A more familiar concept is that most medicine requires a <em>Rezept</em> (“prescription”)
from a doctor in order to pick it up at an <em>Apotheke</em> (“pharmacy”). Despite all the talk of
digitized patient records and “<em>E-Rezepte</em>,” Germany is still a very paper-based society
and you’re likely going to have to bring a stupid piece of paper with you every time you
need to pick up medication. Occasionally you can ask the doctor’s office to send it
directly to the <em>Apotheke</em> if it’s one nearby or you have their fax number handy.</p>
<h3 id="apotheke--over-the-counter">Apotheke / Over the counter</h3>
<p>What’s weird about the <em>Apotheken</em> is that they’re weird amalgams of prescription
medication depots, advisors for over-the-counter medication, and beauty product stores.
You can’t just <em>buy</em> NyQuil here, you have to go up to a person, do a little song and
dance, and hope that you’ve convinced them enough that you get the product that you want.
This goes a little smoother when you <em>don’t</em> know what product you want, as the
pharmacists are usually pretty well trained to help you find what you need. A word of
caution, however – Germans are very medication-averse, so don’t be surprised to get
“herbal” treatments when you expected the real stuff. Sometimes you can explicitly ask for
a medically proven active ingredient, but sometimes you may walk away empty-handed.</p>
<p>I am still astonished that homeopathic “treatments” are not only offered in pharmacies
here, but sometimes <em>actively recommended</em> by pharmacists and doctors! It may sound
like a perverse application of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law">Godwin’s law</a>, but you can literally
<a href="https://quackwatch.org/hx/nazis/">blame the Nazis</a> for this one.</p>
<h3 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h3>
<p>One big failure in the German health system is how mental health is handled. Finding a
German-speaking therapist or psychiatrist is difficult enough, let alone an
English-speaking one.
Supposedly the problem is that the calculation for the number of practitioners
approved in an area by statutory insurance was set in the 90s and was never updated.
If you have statutory insurance and don’t want to wait a year to see a practitioner
(this is not an exaggeration), you’ll often have to just pay the full price out-of-pocket.</p>
<p>Private insurance has a much better track record in this regard, but that means mental
health services are in some ways reserved for the rich.</p>
<p>There is a process to get statutory
insurance to reimburse you for a private practitioner if you can prove that everybody in
your area is full. It’s a complicated process, but some practitioners might be able to
help you navigate it. You will have to pay out-of-pocket to get started, though.</p>
<p><em>The Berliner</em> has a good <a href="https://www.the-berliner.com/berlin/how-to-get-therapy-in-berlin-germany-mental-health/">overview of the whole situation</a> and how to
deal with it.</p>
<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
<p>The food system in Europe is in some ways pretty awesome, and in other ways quite
limiting.</p>
<h3 id="bread">Bread</h3>
<p>European bread is on another level. For my entire life, “bread” lasted for weeks in the
cupboard. It turns out, that’s what makes Wonderbread <em>wonder</em> bread – it has
preservatives in it to make it last far longer. Normal bread only keeps for a few days!</p>
<p>The demand for fresh bread has created a whole supply chain and distribution network
for fresh baked goods that easily outclasses that in the US. Gas stations and train
stations don’t have shrink-wrapped cheese danishes with year-long shelf lives. They have
pastries baked daily, and often freshly made little sandwiches with meat and cheese.
Cities themselves are dotted with bakeries, and often you’ll be within walking distance
of several of them.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that there are variations in quality – you can definitely taste the
difference between an industrially baked croissant and one made locally at the bakery
itself – but the average quality is much higher and the variance much lower.</p>
<p>What you gain in quality you pay for in choice – often you’ll only find the same
variation of the same few pastries or bread types. You’ll occasionally find a fun thing,
but a step into an American supermarket will remind you of the shocking emphasis they have
on having 10 different brands of peanut butter.</p>
<h3 id="cheese--dairy">Cheese / Dairy</h3>
<p>Like bread, cheese is one of Europe’s core competencies. The average supermarket will have
an intimidating cheese selection, both from pasteurized and unpasteurized milks of
various mammals.</p>
<p>If you’re a cheese eater it’s definitely worth trying out some random ones, being open to
the fact that some of them taste or smell downright terrible. I can’t stomach camembert or
brunost but there are a lot of good cheeses I’ve discovered while I’ve been here. Note
that unpasteurized cheese can come with some health risks, but if you’re not
immunocompromised or pregnant it’s usually ok.</p>
<p>What may be a bit unsettling is seeing unrefrigerated milk and eggs. Eggs are not
washed in Europe like they are in the States, which leaves on a protective coating that
lets them last at room temperature much longer. Refrigerating them just extends this
longer, and a close read of the label will show two expiration dates depending on if
they’re refrigerated or not. Similarly, ultrapasteurized milk is milk that stays good for
months at room temperature, but needs to be refrigerated once open.</p>
<h3 id="meat">Meat</h3>
<p>Meat in Europe is generally handled similarly to meat in the US, with a big exception:
pork is better handled here, and (with proper preparation) can be eaten undercooked or
even raw. I’ve eaten <em>Mett</em> (“pork tartare”) and lived to tell the tale, but it took some courage to do it.
It’s common to have cured but not cooked bacon for breakfast. Everyone keeps saying it’s
safe, but it takes a lot to undo an entire lifetime of avoiding uncooked pork.</p>
<h3 id="coffee">Coffee</h3>
<p>Coffee, as in the States, serves a dual purpose as “concentration fuel” and gourmet
experience. However, the latter is emphasized far more than the former. This means that
filter coffee from a carafe is readily available at gas stations and other places where
you’re just trying to get from point A to B, but quite rare to get at a restaurant.
Sometimes you’ll get lucky and a <em>Milchkaffee</em> (“milk coffee”) will be filter coffee with cream, but often
the only way to get anything approaching filter coffee is to admit defeat and order an
americano. I’ve adapted by ordering cappuccinos all the time.</p>
<p>The concept of unlimited filter coffee is foreign here, to the point that when a (sadly
now closed) American diner in Berlin offered it, it was a point of conversation for both
Americans and non-Americans alike. Living abroad means excitedly saying things like “they
had the coffee carafes, like from Denny’s, and the waiter just walks around filling up
your mug!”</p>
<h3 id="alcohol">Alcohol</h3>
<p>Yes, you really can drink beer on the street! The European attitude toward alcohol is far
more relaxed, and in my opinion more healthy. Because it’s everywhere and not strictly
controlled and locked down, people binge drink less. That’s not to say that people don’t
binge drink (how else could you explain the existence of Schlager music?) but it’s far
more acceptable to socially drink in small quantities. I think the stronger public transit
options and weaker Puritan influences drive the shocking (to Americans) attitude toward alcohol here.</p>
<p>Fun fact: the drinking age is 21 in the US because the National Highway Board found
that drunk driving accidents fall off sharply after 21 years of age, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Minimum_Drinking_Age_Act">therefore states
don’t get federal highway funding</a> if their legal drinking age is under 21. Sucks if you don’t drive, I guess.</p>
<h4 id="wine">Wine</h4>
<p>I’m not a knowledgeable wine drinker, but wine is both cheaper and of higher quality in
Europe than what I’ve seen in the US. Enjoy!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>The physical copies of <a href="https://book.webtypography.net/">my book on Web Typography</a> sold out quickly. I self-published, and print runs are expensive when you’re funding them yourself, so numbers were limited. However it was always my plan to publish an ebook at the same time, and that has out-sold the hard copy by an order of magnitude.</p>

<p>I set myself some pretty stiff criteria for the ebook – it needed to replicate the design of print edition as far as possible, adapting to the medium when required. To this day I’m proud of the result. I completely hand-coded the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/">ePub</a> (meaning it’s mostly <abbr>HTML</abbr> and <abbr>CSS</abbr> under the hood), and I believe the effort paid off. If you’ll forgive the rather un-British boasting, I still think it’s one of the more advanced ebooks out there: with embedded fonts, <abbr>SVG</abbr> images, alt text, bold typographic heirarchy, Javascript-driven syntax highlighting and what I hope is a nuanced, highly readable overall design. Not bad for an ebook anyway, although I’ll grant you the bar is not set high (notable exceptions include <a href="https://abookapart.com/">A Book Apart</a> publications).</p>

<p>All hubris aside, I am still frequently embarrassed by how the ebook renders, particularly in Apple Books. Like a well structured webpage, my book uses a lot of headings and subheadings – I wrote it to be referenced as much as to be read, so this helps the scanability of the text. However Apple Books, and other WebKit, Gecko, or old Blink-powered ebook readers will happily do this to headings:</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://clagnut.com/images/2426/ebook-widows.png" alt="Screen shot of Apple Books rendering an ePub"></figure>

<p>Notice the orphaned heading “Lean on six centuries of typesetting&nbsp;experience” with its following paragraph out of sight on the next page. This is a typographic no-no, and has been for – um – six centuries. Far better for the reader to have the heading attached to its paragraph on the next page, even if that means leaving some redundant whitespace in its place.</p>

<p>Since 1997(!) and the early drafts of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-CSS2-971104/page.html#h-12.2">CSS2</a>, there has been an easy way to tell browsers not insert a page break directly after, or in the middle of, a heading:</p>

<figure><div data-element="code-block"><pre><code>h2 {
    page-break-after: avoid;
    page-break-inside: avoid;
}
</code></pre></div></figure>



<figure><div data-element="code-block"><pre><code>h2 {
    break-after: avoid;
    break-inside: avoid;
}
</code></pre></div></figure>

<p>However 26 years later, <code>break-after:avoid</code> is still not supported by either Safari or Firefox, and was only <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=223068#c54">introduced to Chrome 108</a> in December 2022. I’ve put together a <a href="https://codepen.io/clagnut/pen/MWZRBaM">test for support of <code>break-after</code> and <code>break-inside</code></a> in multi-column layout. Have a play with it in Chrome – try removing <code>break-inside:avoid</code> and then <code>break-after:avoid</code> from the <code>h2</code> rule in the <abbr>CSS</abbr> and you should see how the subheadings end up at the bottom of a column, or worse still, split over two columns.</p>

<p>Browser support for <abbr>CSS</abbr> properties tends to follow demand from web developers. Unlike in 1997 – or indeed 2017 – there is now an annual Interop arrangement between browser rendering engine makers in which they agree a common list of priorities for <abbr>CSS</abbr> and other web technologies. Interop 2024 has just closed for new proposals. Unfortunately I didn’t manage to submit a request in time for breaking controls to be universally implemented. Thankfully Scott Kellum of <a href="https://typetura.com/">Typetura</a> did put in a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/web-platform-tests/projects/3/views/1?pane=issue&amp;itemId=40510069">proposal for advanced multi-column layouts</a> to be improved, and this included support for <code>break-</code> properties. Sadly there’s little to no clamour for it from other developers – the blog post you’re reading probably doubles the published demand, and that’s just for within columns.</p>

<p><ins><strong>Update:</strong> Annoyingly the proposal <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop/issues/520#issuecomment-1921897115">was not selected</a> for Interop 2024.  I'll just have to keep prodding the bug reports and keep my fingers crossed they are fixed soon – <strong>these bugs are older than some of my colleagues!</strong></ins></p>

<p>Paged media is very much a forgotten aspect, and it’s probably true that web pages are rarely printed in the grand scheme of things, however ebooks are definitely a popular form of paged media and deserve attention. I’d certainly like to read ebooks without failed typographic fundamentals.</p></section></div>]]></description>

                <div id="art-body-desc">
                        <p>Last week, the US Forest Service announced it would stop prescribed burning in California “<a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/1994972/forest-service-halts-prescribed-burns-california-worth-risk">for the foreseeable future,</a>” stating that the decision was made as a precautionary measure to ensure the availability of staff and equipment in case of potential wildfires. But temps are falling across California, and state, tribal authorities, and prescribed burn associations have commenced with their prescribed burns. If the federal agency doesn’t hold up its end of the work, all that mitigation work can be undone.</p>
<p>To grasp the impact of the Forest Service’s decision on California, it’s essential to understand the history of the state and the intricate mosaic of private, state, and federal land that constitutes the forests. Over the past 100 years, the state and federal governments relied on a “<a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/books/tending-the-wild/paper">paramilitary-like program</a>” that focused on fire suppression by rapidly mobilizing firefighters and equipment. Very little was done regarding fire prevention besides creating the famous Smokey Bear ad campaign. One of the problems was that colonialist attitudes of fire officials constantly disregarded the valuable knowledge of forest management practices held by California’s Indigenous communities. One such practice is prescribed burning, which involves intentionally setting controlled fires to remove dry vegetation that could serve as “ladder fuel,” allowing wildfires to spread to taller vegetation. Without this mitigation work, the buildup of vegetation and increasing average global temperatures has created the conditions for the mega-wildfires we see in the West today.</p>
<p>These destructive fires have over time shifted state and federal policies toward wildfire mitigation. California’s recently enacted 2024-25 budget includes <a href="https://ebudget.ca.gov/2024-25/pdf/Enacted/BudgetSummary/NaturalResourcesandEnvironmentalProtection.pdf">$4.2 billion and 12,512 positions</a> for CAL FIRE, which provides resource management and fire protection services across 31 million acres of state forests. However, California relies on the federal government to maintain areas outside state and local control, mainly the 20 million acres of National Forests managed by the Forest Service. The Forest Service, like many other federal agencies, lacks stable long-term funding because the continuing resolution process constantly threatens its programs. In the past, these issues have had dire consequences for Californians.</p>
<p>In 2021, the Caldor Fire started in the El Dorado National Forest, and the Forest Service knew this region was at risk. The agency had created a model two decades before the fire predicting the danger and proposed the Trestle Project in 2013 to manage federal land near the town of Grizzly Flats. The project was expected to be completed by 2020. However, an <a href="https://www.capradio.org/articles/2022/08/16/how-we-measured-us-forest-service-wildfire-prevention-work/">investigation</a> by CapRadio and the California Newsroom discovered only 2,137 acres of the planned 15,000, or 14 percent of the project, had been completed before August 14, 2021. That was the day the Caldor Fire started, and 48 hours later, the fire had leveled Grizzly Flats.</p>
<p>According to<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/26/1125172945/forest-service-fell-short-of-executing-plan-to-protect-town-from-fire-probe-find"> NPR</a>, the Trestle Project faced “staffing shortages, pushback from environmental groups, too many days when prescribed burns would be dangerous due to hotter, drier conditions caused by climate change,” and, most importantly, a lack of funding. Unfortunately, the Trestle Project’s setbacks left Grizzly Flats and other El Dorado County communities vulnerable to the scenario the Forest Service had modeled.&nbsp; Tellingly, as the fire moved east toward Lake Tahoe, the community of Kirkwood was <a href="https://snowbrains.com/kirkwood-mountain-resort-no-fire-damage-caldor/">spared</a> thanks to an <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd741953.pdf">escaped prescribed burn</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>This scenario shows what happens when Congress is less committed than California to tackling forest management. With wildfire management funding constantly tied up in unpredictable budget debates, the current state-federal partnership is fragile and based on the whims of the legislative and executive branches, which can withhold funding based on which political party is currently in power. The Forest Service’s latest decision is the consequence of these issues.</p>
<p>Congress must commit to forest management by providing stable and reliable funding for wildfire prevention. Forest management is not a partisan issue – it is a matter of public safety, environmental protection, and economic sustainability. It’s well past time to put politics aside and cooperate with California and other fire-prone states to ensure that we provide the resources needed to manage forests, reduce the danger of wildfires, and safeguard communities.</p>
<p>EDIT: The original version of this article referred to Smokey Bear as Smokey the Bear. Officially, the mascot is named Smokey Bear. In popular culture, the “the” was added by a song in 1952 by Steve Nelson and Jack Rollins and stuck with the general public.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>One of the best parts of antitrust trials is how much information comes into the public domain about corporations that usually keep details about their industry private. The Kroger-Albertsons supermarket merger case is no different. One interesting nugget is that supermarket executives sees rural markets as particularly easy to monopolize, because there is often just one store. They even have a name, “no-comp[etition] or low-comp[etition] zones,” according to one executive on the stand.</p><p>Of course that makes sense, we’d expect firms to maximize profits where they can. One might be tempted to say, well, there are some towns that can’t support more than one store. And that might be true, except that there are several examples of supermarket chains using tactics in such towns to thwart the opening of competition. How? Well, they find a way to dominate the existing plots of land and building suitable for such a store.</p><p><span>In June, for instance, Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who is also litigating against the merger, </span><a href="https://www.supermarketnews.com/legislation-regulatory-news/albertsons-lifts-land-use-restriction-in-washington" rel="">fined</a><span> Albertsons $25,000 for imposing a land use restriction on a store it sold in 2018 in a low-income section of Bellingham, Washington. As part of the sale, the supermarket giant put a requirement on the deed that no grocery store could open there until 2038. Ferguson found this provision was a violation of the state antitrust law.</span></p><p>These kinds of land use restrictions are likely common. A few months ago, I got an email from an economist explaining how Albertsons abuses its monopoly power in a small skiing town in rural California using a similar strategy. </p><blockquote><p>I’m in Mammoth, CA. The town needs more grocery, but they’re limited on land. There’s a vacant Kmart that is desirable, BUT the local Vons grocery (which is owned by Albertsons) is leasing the old Kmart of keep it vacant (to the tune of $750k annually). The community is outraged, but feels they cant do anything…</p><p>It’s so apparent walking in the Vons in that region that customer service is dismissed. Workers aren’t happy, store shelves aren’t stocked, and the general messiness is simply undignified.”</p></blockquote><p><span>In Mammoth Lakes, there are two old K-Mart lots that could easily welcome competitive grocery stores, but both are foreclosed by Albertsons. According to </span><a href="https://www.easternsierranow.com/whats-bugging-you-eastern-sierra-oh-tenants-where-art-thou/" rel="">the mayor</a><span>, there are deed restrictions that “deter big box retailers such as Target/Walmart, and basically completely block grocery retailers.” According to a different media outlet, the prohibition is not in the deed, but is a direct leasing arrangement. Vons </span><a href="https://thesheetnews.com/2019/11/15/bishop-kmart-to-close/" rel="">started</a><span> leasing one plot in 2019 when K-Mart went under, “holding the space hostage.” It now leases the other as well. It doesn’t actually matter which strategy is involved, both are intended to restrict new grocery stores so there’s no competition.</span></p><p>And it looks as if Albertson’s monopolization strategy has worked. Here are the first several Google reviews about the local Vons, along with pictures.</p><blockquote><p>“The most expensive Vons in California is also in the worst physical condition,” wrote one reviewer. “Worn and missing floor tiles, empty shelves, rude employees etc…”</p><p>“This is effectively the only grocery store in town and seems to have a hard time keeping items in stock…”</p><p>“There were a lot of bare shelves and the vegetables looked well picked over. Got the 6 items that I wanted and tried to pay. Self check-out counters were all closed. There was only one cash register light on and NOBODY was there…”</p><p>“Definitely the worst and dirtiest Vons I've ever seen… It's clear the owners operate on the "only game in town" ethos. Losers...”</p><p>“Always a terrible experience at this store. Limited selection of items and saying the older female checker is surly is an understatement. She doesn't understand Vons and Safeway are the same, yelled at me for adding items to our order, refused to honor the digital coupon prices and told us to shop at Grocery Outlet…”</p><p>“Consensus among locals is that everything purchased here basically rots within a day or so of purchase…”</p></blockquote><div><figure><a target="_blank"

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2024/10/428701/poor-sleep-midlife-linked-faster-brain-atrophy">https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2024/10/428701/poor-sleep-midlife-linked-faster-brain-atrophy</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42045658">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For adults in midlife, difficulty getting to sleep and waking up too early may accelerate brain atrophy that is associated with dementia.</p>

<p>The brain naturally begins to atrophy beginning in one’s 30s and 40s. But this can become much more pronounced with dementia and disorders like traumatic brain injury, stroke and, in some cases, multiple sclerosis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if the cause of dementia is unrelated to sleep, it’s possible that poor sleep may advance or exacerbate cognitive symptoms.”</p>


</blockquote>

<p>To estimate the effects of sleep quality on the brain, the researchers surveyed approximately 600 adults on how well they slept. The participants were asked the same questions five years later and underwent brain scans 10 years after this.</p>

<p>The researchers used machine learning, leveraging data from the scans, to estimate the brain age of each participant based on the actual degree of brain shrinkage. They found that even after adjusting for age, sex, education, health and lifestyle factors, the brains of those participants who slept poorly were more atrophied than those who slept well.</p>

<p>Compared to the 70% of the sample who reported having little trouble sleeping, those with moderate difficulty (22%) had brains that were 1.6 years older, while those with the most difficulty (8%) had brains that were 2.6 years older.</p>

<p>The study publishes in <em><a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209988">Neurology</a></em> on Oct. 23.</p>

<p>“While we can’t say that poor sleep causes dementia, earlier research has established an association,” said first author <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/clemence.cavailles">Clémence Cavaillès</a>, PhD, of the UCSF Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. “Even if the cause of dementia is unrelated to sleep, it’s possible that poor sleep may advance or exacerbate cognitive symptoms.”</p>

<p>The participants, who were 40 years old on average when they enrolled, were part of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, which investigates the factors that influence cardiovascular disease, as well as how they may relate to dementia. They were asked about short sleep duration, poor quality of sleep, difficulty getting to sleep, difficulty staying asleep, early morning awakening and daytime sleepiness.</p>

<h2>Lack of sleep not a factor … or is it?</h2>

<p>Surprisingly, lack of sleep was not one of the characteristics relating to brain aging. “Sleep problems frequently emerge in midlife,” said Cavaillès. “They’re likely due to work stress, family caregiving and menopause,” she said. “Although the study found inadequate sleep duration was not an issue in brain atrophy in this study, we cannot say there is no association,” she said, noting that a previous CARDIA study showed that shorter sleep was associated with worse white matter integrity, indicating lower cognitive functioning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Future research should investigate the life-course effect of sleep on brain health in young populations.”</p>


</blockquote>

<p>Poor sleep that persisted over five years, especially when it related to difficulty getting to sleep and early morning awakening, was found to be highly relevant to brain aging.</p>

<p>“The study shows that poor sleep could be a target for early interventions to prevent possible cognitive decline,” said senior author <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/kristine.yaffe">Kristine Yaffe</a>, MD, of the UCSF departments of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Neurology, and Epidemiology and Biostatistics.</p>

<p>“Public health initiatives could include emphasizing sleep quality over quantity in midlife – and recognizing the long-term impact of poor sleep quality on the brain,” added Yaffe, who is a member of the first team of experts to determine that 30% of dementia risk is preventable. “Future research should investigate the life-course effect of sleep on brain health in young populations.”</p>

My research and practice was not centered enough on “AI” and “emerging technology” to fit within the institution; they wanted someone with more of an explicit emphasis on tech. My work in publishing, writing, web-design—and even my reproductive state—couldn’t possibly be separated from these things, but, more than any other effects AI may have on humanity in the future, this is one of the main effects now: people feel compelled to talk about it, and it’s a good way for sclerotic institutions to feel like they’re keeping up with the times. I smiled, thanked him, and left with an M&amp;M cookie.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Earlier this month, at the recommendation of a colleague, I registered to attend a Zoom seminar that boasted a discussion on “the future of design education and academia.” As the Zoom window expanded, I was met with a looping Pornhub threesome montage next to a side-screen grid of six or so designers front-facing the camera. The hosts clicked around, grunting and gasping as the camera cut to new angles and positions. I opened my department group chat and texted my colleagues </span><em>OH NO. DO NOT JOIN THE CALL.</em><span> The colleague who recommended the talk echoed me: </span><em>DO NOT LOG IN! SOMEONE Hacked their Zoom.</em></p><p>The hosts spoke to each other saying things like:</p><p><em>I think it’s you.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Wait. Oh wait. No.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>This type of thing happened all the time during Covid. So annoying.</em></p><p><em>Who is *bot-generated-username*?&nbsp;</em></p><p>It was a long two minutes before someone finally had the sense to end the call.&nbsp;</p><p><span>A few hours later, a nearby university, who employs one of the guest speakers, posted a carousel of screenshots on their Instagram page from the talk, which had apparently reconvened. The description read </span><em>Thanks to our Program Director ************** for an amazing panel discussion on the future of design education &amp; academia today!</em><span> 🚀</span></p><p>I tried to follow up with the panel about what happened, and received no reply.&nbsp;</p><p>The way this talk was handled reminded me that technology, for all its promise of connection and innovation, can have real and tangible repercussions if we’re not careful—it illuminates our fundamental responsibility to one another.</p><p><span>In “A Rant about Technology,” Ursula K. Le Guin says that technology is </span><em>how a society copes with physical reality</em><span>. That it </span><em>is the active human interface with the material world.</em><span> Technology is also a spoon. Technology is also language. Yet, I am shocked when AI does not stop Outlook Messenger from bursting confetti across my desktop in response to the </span><em>Congratulations</em><span> reply I receive when HR misreads my email about both adding and removing our late son from my health insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>As a 6th grader in a Dallas suburb, I attended a school assembly where a traveling speaker talked to us about sex. He said that sex was like fire. It was a life force. The discovery of fire sparked a massive advance of civilization. He told us that if we were not careful with fire, if we did not watch it closely and respect the power that it held, we could burn down a whole village. He told us to start a fire someday, but only with someone who you trusted to tend to it while you slept. I believe now that this same sort of diligence must also be extended to our use of technology.&nbsp;</p><p><span>This year I experienced many technological interventions to my body, as many do when they become pregnant. Of all the new ways to be measured and monitored, my favorite was when my sister-in-law, due just a few weeks before me, guessed my midsection's exact circumference with a piece of string. My least favorite was the transvaginal ultrasound. My OB in Virginia had a sort of nonchalance and slapstick humor to him that initially made me feel comfortable in his office. The temperature changed during my nine week appointment when he, quite unexpectedly, shook the ultrasound wand inside of me (with vigor!) in an attempt to wake the baby for the pictures. He mutter-yelled </span><em>Move little bugger. Move! </em><span>I looked to the nurse witness, who looked forward at the door. We received a letter in December that his practice would be closing in April. We received another at the end of summer telling us that he had died.</span></p><p><span>During this same pregnancy, another doctor does imaging on me, externally. With the wand in his hand in the almost pitch black room he tells us that there are two small and one moderate-sized holes in our son’s heart and that he will need to be rushed to surgery as soon as he is born. I am still fully reclined and covered in gel. He tells us to come back in two weeks. On his walk out of the room he hands us an information pamphlet where he drew on the back two versions of the human heart—one </span><em>normal</em><span>, one </span><em>our situation</em><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Because of this experience, we transfer care to Massachusetts, where my husband’s family lives and works in the medical field. We navigate this with someone who is known as “The worldwide head of second opinion.” At the new hospital the gel is cleared off my belly each time. I cry in the ultrasound room as the video of the baby in my belly is labeled “practice breathing.” The sonographer walks us to a conference room where we’re met with cardiac specialists, social workers and obstetrics. Our meetings are prefaced with </span><em>This is going to be a hard conversation</em><span> and when we stand up to leave the room, we are encouraged to take the entire box of tissues with us. Someone even goes to the cupboard to get us a new box, of superior quality and softness.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We are told that we may not get to meet him, but we do. The windowless OR looks perfectly encapsulated in pure even daylight. We have a team of thirty people and everyone knows the choreography. The anesthesiologist tells me that I may feel a shock of sorts before she administers a liquid into my spine. I am beaming. I feel strong and I wait for the shock. I squeal. The staff echos my laughter when I tell them that it feels like I sat on a firecracker. They had not heard that one before. The team yells out </span><em>Happy Birthday Henry!</em><span> as he is lifted from my abdominal cavity, screaming and alive. The anesthesiologist tells us with urgency to touch him and she guides our hands to meet his head through the dividing screen. I keep my fingers at the place he fogged the plastic as he is carried away to receive care.&nbsp;</span></p><p>While my layers are being stitched up, my husband notices that the TVs near the ceiling are screening the surgery from above. When a nurse sees him watching, they switch off the monitors. The birth was photographed by our social worker, who printed and laminated the images. A whole stack is waiting for us in our room on the meal tray when we return.</p><p>When I see him next, there is a whole room dedicated to beating his heart. I am wheeled to his side and told not to worry about the beeping, it is just an indication of a new switch to flip. That it is not as time sensitive as it sounds. Henry wraps his hand around my finger, then around the beak of his woodpecker Jellycat. He is on a high platform and adorned in wires and tubing like some sort of cybernetic king. One part of the room-machine spins constantly. It whirls and re-oxygenates the donor blood that has exited him in a slightly less vibrant shade of red than what entered.&nbsp;</p><p>He fights for two days. On his third, when he chooses peace, it is the quietest room I have ever endured. The cardiologist encloses us with the curtain and lets us stay as long as we can.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We have a mass in Henry’s name. Afterward, family comes over. They bring food and two new pink babies. I hold my niece and keep checking that my hair does not wrap around her fingers. Our dog screams in the face of the two-year-old cousin, who seems completely unaffected. He says “dog” and pats him. He points to the angel on the mantle and says “Amen.” We set up a small box in the living room with photographs printed out from the hospital. As his mother, I feel protective of his image. I do not want people to look at him on their phones. I want to be in control of how he is seen in his corporeal form. I want people to sit on the couch and hold him, looking together at the same time and passing him around as they would any other baby. I become upset when I log in to Facebook for the first time in years, to sell a lamp, and see that some of our pictures from the hospital were posted to the family’s facebook group. I stew on this for a while, then release it when my husband reminds me about when they were posted, his first good day on the ECMO machine. We were two proud normal parents. They were asking the family for prayers.&nbsp;</p><p>During the next three months, I look at his pictures for fifteen minutes every three hours to trigger a milk letdown. I imagine kissing his head and can still taste his baptismal holy water on my lips. Smell the perfumed oil. I nurse a small machine all summer and a refrigerated car comes by to pick up the milk that will be processed, divided, and sent off to babies I will never know. My husband wakes up in the middle of the night to wash the flanges, label the bags, and place them in the freezer. At home, we keep a white noise machine of the ocean waves playing in the bedroom at all times. We have done this for years, but I only just now am paying attention to it. When my dog unplugs it, I notice its absence.</p><p>Earlier this spring my department chair threw me a baby shower. My students ate cupcakes and giggled as we failed to answer baby related pop-culture trivia from the 80’s. At the end of summer I send them a sad email to thank them for their patience last year and I ask for it again. This fall I sit in class with them, smiling as laughter bubbles from the corners of their mouths in response to the recording I play of Richard Brautigan reciting this poem:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><p><label contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label></p><pre><em>I like to think (and
the sooner the better!)
of a cybernetic meadow
where mammals and computers
live together in mutually
programming harmony
like pure water
touching clear sky.

I like to think
(right now, please!)
of a cybernetic forest
filled with pines and electronics
where deer stroll peacefully
past computers
as if they were flowers
with spinning blossoms.

I like to think
(it has to be!)
of a cybernetic ecology
where we are free of our labors
and joined back to nature,
returned to our mammal
brothers and sisters,
and all watched over
by machines of loving grace.</em></pre></div><p>I took part in another Zoom call this week. Henry’s cord blood was collected for research and after five months, the results came back. They were able to find the exact single gene mutation that caused his condition, and explained everything. They assured us that it was not our well water, or the time I had a fever for 15 minutes, or leptospirosis from cat-sitting, or that I ate an underdone yolk. The doctors said that with the variation he had, they were surprised that he was able to make it to two days old. My friend Mary texted me a message her late father used to say about heaven.&nbsp;</p><p><em>We are there before we’re born and God asks us if we want to come down to Earth even though it will be painful and hard. Seems Henry wanted badly to be yours and to meet you if only for a single shining day.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Neither my husband nor I carry this gene. And the doctors tell us that the same thing is unlikely to repeat. They clear us to try again this year.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Lately, my husband and I have been watching a lot of TV together. Football when we’re grading so we don’t have to see the Patriots lose. And movies at night. There is a scene in the film </span><em>Magnolia</em><span> by Paul Thomas Anderson where frogs begin falling from the sky. They drop to the pavement violently, cars crash, and there is a little boy sitting in a library at a desk looking out the window cracking a half smile in wonder. Shadows of amphibious bodies cast on the wall behind him as he says out loud </span><em>This happens. This is something that happens.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
		
<article>
	<p>Writing is one of the most powerful forms of communication, and it’s useful in a multitude of roles and contexts. As a <a href="https://rmoff.net/">blog-writing</a>, <a href="https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3Adocs+author%3Armoff+">documentation-authoring</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rmoff/status/1587382202781913089">twitter-shitposting</a> DevEx engineer I spend a lot of my time writing. Recently, someone paid me a very nice compliment about a blog I’d written and asked how they could learn to write like me and what resources I’d recommend.</p>
<p>Never one to miss a chance to write and share something, here’s my response to this :)</p>
<p>To begin with I want to cover briefly the motivations behind writing.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-i-write">Why Do <strong>I</strong> Write?&nbsp;<a href="#why-do-i-write">🔗</a> </h2>
<p>Firstly, I like <strong>to share information</strong>. That could be a new <a href="https://rmoff.net/2021/03/04/quick-profiling-of-data-in-apache-kafka-using-kafkacat-and-visidata/">tool</a> or <a href="https://lakefs.io/blog/data-engineering-patterns-write-audit-publish/">technique</a> that I’ve learnt, <a href="https://rmoff.net/2020/09/30/setting-key-value-when-piping-from-jq-to-kafkacat/">a clever trick</a> I’ve discovered, or sometimes away from the technical and into the realms of <a href="https://rmoff.net/2019/02/09/travelling-for-work-with-kids-at-home/">life pondering</a> and <a href="https://rmoff.net/2023/05/23/what-does-this-devex-engineer-do/">navel gazing</a>. In the case of this very blog, it’s to share my thoughts on something that interests me. I could have written some notes and sent them directly back to the person who asked the original question, but if it was useful to them it’s hopefully useful to others—so therefore it’s worth writing up and publishing.</p>
<p>The second reason that I’ll write is <strong>to learn about something</strong>. It’s one thing to hand-wave one’s way through a presentation. It’s another to commit pen to paper (well, bytes to disk) and <a href="https://rmoff.net/2018/08/02/kafka-listeners-explained/">explain something</a>. Quite often I’ll realise that there’s a gap—or gaps—in my knowledge that I need to explore first before I can properly write about something, and that’s the very reason that I do it.</p>
<p>There are several pleasant side-effects from writing too. Anything in the public domain (such as your blog, but also open-source project documentation, etc) helps establish your credibility in an area and awareness by others of you. We may never reach the stratospheric heights of someone such as Kelsey Hightower, who has wowed a generation of developers with their <a href="https://youtu.be/HlAXp0-M6SY?t=718">Tetris-playing skills</a>, but being known as <em>that guy</em> who wrote a really useful blog that helped others is still a really nice feeling :)</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-write-for-developers">HOW do I Write for Developers?&nbsp;<a href="#how-do-i-write-for-developers">🔗</a> </h2>
<h3 id="-stop-watch-this-first-">🛑 STOP! Watch This First 🎥&nbsp;<a href="#-stop-watch-this-first-">🔗</a> </h3>
<p>Go and watch this excellent lecture called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM">The Craft of Writing Effectively</a>. It’s given by Larry McEnerney who is the Director of the University of Chicago’s Writing Program and knows a thing or two about writing. There are direct parallels between his observations on how and why academics communicate, and communication between developers.</p>
<p>👉🏻 I’ve seen it recommended several times but to my embarrassment, the length put me off—but I wish it hadn’t as it’s superb.</p>
<p><em>If you’d rather listen instead of watch you can use <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp"><code>yt-dlp</code></a> to download it as audio (<code>--extract-audio --audio-format mp3</code>).</em></p>
<h3 id="so-how-do-i-write-for-developers">So, how do I write for developers?&nbsp;<a href="#so-how-do-i-write-for-developers">🔗</a> </h3>
<p>Each writer will have their own approach to writing, and it will vary based on the audience and purpose too. A report for publication in an academic journey will have a different structure to a shitpost on Twitter. A blog aimed at developers will read very differently from the documentation from the depths of a product manual. Each medium and audience is valid; the knack is making sure that your writing lines up with it.</p>
<p>When I write I try to write for myself—a developer, interested in a thing. That could be a new technology, an in-depth explanation, a random musing on life, or anything else. Would I like to read the thing I’ve read? Does it avoid the pitfalls that plague the soulless bland crap that some companies churn out, stick an emoji on, and call developer marketing?</p>
<p>There are three key dimensions that it’s useful to consider here:</p>
<ul>
<li>clarity</li>
<li>personality (also called voice)</li>
<li>uniformity of content.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can roughly overlay these dimensions across the range of written materials that we might write:</p>
<img src="https://rmoff.net/images/2023/07/01.svg" width="600/">
<p>Things aren’t always so simple, and for some platforms in particular there’s quite a range:</p>
<img src="https://rmoff.net/images/2023/07/02.svg" width="600/">
<p>What do these different dimensions mean in practice? Let’s explore that.</p>
<h4 id="clarity-is-key">Clarity is Key&nbsp;<a href="#clarity-is-key">🔗</a> </h4>
<p>The first of these dimensions is pretty straightforward and shouldn’t really vary. Whatever you write, for whomever you write it, <strong>it has to be clear</strong>. Writing clearly means everything from sentence construction and paragraph breaks through to the structure of your article. It can be surprisingly hard to do but is crucial if you want to write material that people will <em>want</em> to read.</p>
<p>One neat trick when it comes to clarity is to remember that <em>what you leave out</em> is as important as what you leave in. This is going to be very context-specific. Documentation, by definition, should be comprehensive. A blog, on the other hand, might want to get to the point sooner and just provide a link to background material for the reader should they want it. Less is often more, as they say.</p>
<p>Some types of writing are going to have greater scope for individuality than others, but all have the potential to at least be accessible and clear. For example, just because you’re writing documentation doesn’t give you a pass to copy and paste the requirements doc in all its generic and obscure complexity. Write documentation that you as a developer would like to read. It can be complex and precise, yet still accessible.</p>
<h4 id="personality-and-voice">Personality and Voice&nbsp;<a href="#personality-and-voice">🔗</a> </h4>
<p>Should the ‘voice’ of the author be allowed to come through in the writing?</p>
<p>This is very much a sliding scale. I’ve jotted down <em>some</em> of the characteristics you might associate with either extreme of the scale. This is not to say that by definition you’d put cuss words into a blog so as to convey your voice—but as an example of something that you might see at that end of the spectrum and definitely not at the other.</p>
<img src="https://rmoff.net/images/2023/07/03.svg" height="300/">
<p>How you decide where to pitch your voice on this scale will come down to your preference, audience, and general area and discipline. If you spend much time on Twitter you’ll notice that InfoSec Twitter is different from DevOps Twitter, which is different again from DataEng Twitter. Each has its own cliques and customs, and also a varying range to which an author’s voice shines through in published writing.</p>
<p>You’ll generally find that generally writing mediums such as a project report to stakeholders or product documentation requires a neutral voice. That’s not to say <em>boring</em>, but it is to say that a certain uniformity is required. In the case of a project report, the message mustn’t be obscured by colloquialisms and the such. And can you imagine the cognitive dissonance if a set of documentation were written by multiple writers each looking to stamp their personality on the pages?</p>
<p>When we get to things like blogs and other types of writing we <em>deliberately</em> want to include some personality. How much is up to you to calibrate with your audience and yourself. There is a “Goldilocks” zone here—enough personality and genuine voice coming through to convince the reader that they are reading something that was written by someone who is actually interested and informed on the matter, but not so much that it gets in the way of the content.</p>
<h4 id="uniformity-and-standardisation">Uniformity and Standardisation&nbsp;<a href="#uniformity-and-standardisation">🔗</a> </h4>
<p>This has a strong relationship with personality and voice but relates a lot more to the structure and content of the material</p>
<img src="https://rmoff.net/images/2023/07/04.svg" height="300/">
<p>Using the example of blogs, you’ll find that blogs for a company or project are going to have a strong focus on the consistency of messaging and structure. There’ll be an introduction, there’ll be context; it’ll be comprehensive.</p>
<p>Compare that to a personal blog that may sometimes be not much more than the gutterings of a developer wanting to log an error message and solution for future Googlers. They <em>might</em> flesh it out into a longer article, but that’s not necessary for it still to have value.</p>
<h4 id="a-holistic-view">A Holistic View&nbsp;<a href="#a-holistic-view">🔗</a> </h4>
<p>It may seem like there’s going to be a linear relationship between the two dimensions. As we decrease the amount of personality coming through in an author’s writings, we’re also going to move towards a much more standardised set of writing.</p>
<p>I’d suggest that it’s not always the case.</p>
<p>A startup may value personality much more over standardisation, perhaps only really dropping the voice when it comes to something like documentation (and even then, perhaps not entirely).</p>

<p>At the other end of the scale, some companies—usually large corporations—have the habit of squeezing the last inch of life out of any kind of writing, making the relationship a much different one.</p>
<p>Here there’s little voice even where you might hope to find it, and that rapidly drops off into nothing very soon after:</p>

<p>The wildcard within this is the social media teams of large companies who <em>are</em> given the remit to be <code>Funny</code> and <code>Engaging</code>, but this is usually outside the scope of developer writing and more into the field of <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/sassiest-responses-from-companies">condiments and fast food chains</a></p>
<h2 id="structuring-your-blog-writing">Structuring your Blog Writing&nbsp;<a href="#structuring-your-blog-writing">🔗</a> </h2>
<p>Like a favourite pair of jeans that’s well-worn, comfy, and slightly saggy round the arse, I have a go-to structure for writing. Come to think of it, I use it for lots of conference talks too. It looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tell them what you’re going to tell them</li>
<li>Tell them</li>
<li>Tell them what you told them</li>
</ol>
<p>What this looks like in practice is something along these lines:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>An intro</strong></p>
<p>What is this thing, and why should the reader <del>give af</del> be interested?</p>
<p>This could be a brief explanation of why I am interested in it, or why you would want to read my take on it. The key thing is you’re relating to your audience here. Not everyone wants to read everything you write, and that’s ok.</p>
<p>Let people self-select out (or in, hopefully) at this stage, but make it nice and easy. For example, if you’re writing about data engineering, make it clear to the appdev crowd that they should move on as there’s nothing to see here (or stick around and learn something new, but as a visitor, not the target audience).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The article itself</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A recap</strong></p>
<p>Make sure you don’t just finish your article with a figurative mic drop—tie up it nicely with a bow (a 🙇🏻 or a 🎀, either works).</p>
<p>This is where marketing would like to introduce you to the acronym CTA (Call To Action) 😉. As an author you can decide how or if to weave that into your narrative.</p>
<p>Either way, you’re going to summarise what you just did and give people something to <em>do</em> with it next. Are there code samples they can go and run or inspect? A new service to sign up for? A video to watch? Or just a general life reflection upon which to ponder.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="-the-physical-act-of-writing-jfdi--">✍🏻 The Physical Act of Writing: JFDI ;-)&nbsp;<a href="#-the-physical-act-of-writing-jfdi--">🔗</a> </h2>
<p><img src="https://rmoff.net/images/2023/07/07.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At the risk of repeating the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-to-draw-an-owl">owl meme</a> I would give the following advice: just start writing!</p>
<p>I don’t mean just go write an article. I mean start writing <strong>something</strong>, <strong><em>anything.</em></strong></p>
<p>Some notes, some snippets, some whole paragraphs. It might even look like this</p>
<p><img src="https://rmoff.net/images/2023/07/08.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The point is you now have <em>something</em>. The sections and threads of a story start to fall out as you write more. What starts as one section perhaps becomes two as you realise there are individual elements to tease out.</p>
<p>Iterate, iterate, and then iterate some more.</p>
<p>That random link you made a note of, where does it fit in what you want to say? Is it pushing the need for a new section or tangent, or is it actually not so relevant and you can park it? Not sure? Well just leave it there and think about it again on the next pass round.</p>
<p>I’ve recently found that using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro timer</a> is an effective way of getting me to focus, and to take a break. Instead of staring at a screen, descending into a pit of despair at the stagnation of an article, you spend a chunk of time and then step away. Perhaps you come back to it after the break or maybe wait longer. Like many problems in life, things resolve themselves given time to marinade in the recesses of one’s brain. That paragraph that just wouldn’t write itself will come spilling out of your eager fingers onto the keyboard. The section you thought you’d <em>nailed</em>—turns out you didn’t and it needs a rewrite. But all these things come with time and iteration through the text.</p>
<h2 id="find-a-really-good-reviewer-and-copyeditor">Find a really good reviewer and copyeditor&nbsp;<a href="#find-a-really-good-reviewer-and-copyeditor">🔗</a> </h2>
<p>You might think you’re good at writing. You’re probably not <em>that</em> good at writing that the eye of an excellent copyeditor won’t improve it, nor the tactful input of a good reviewer enhance it.</p>
<p>Good copyeditors will respect the voice that’s present in your writing and work to preserve it whilst improving the clarity and grammatical accuracy of what you’ve written.</p>
<p>Good reviewers will grok what you’re saying and help distil and mould it into a better shape.</p>

<p><em>We’ve covered the why and the how - but what about the what?</em></p>
<p>What to write will often come from the “Why” above, but let’s imagine that the creative juices aren’t flowing and you still really want to get a blog written.</p>
<p>A really excellent place for ideas is the community around the thing you want to write about. Go and lurk (or even better, join in) at StackOverflow, Twitter, Slack, Discord…wherever the community is:</p>
<ul>
<li>What questions do people repeatedly ask?</li>
<li>What are the anti-patterns and misunderstandings that you see?</li>
<li>What are the new trends?</li>
<li>What cool things can you do with <code>$THING</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In short, if it would be interesting to me then I would write about it.</p>
<p>Make sure to also watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM">this lecture</a> in which the concept of <em>value</em> and <em>ideas</em> is discussed. tl;dr if you aren’t writing about something interesting to the reader, it has no value, regardless of its value to you.</p>
<h3 id="what-not-to-write">What Not to Write?&nbsp;<a href="#what-not-to-write">🔗</a> </h3>
<p>This is a <em>very</em> personal preference. I’m not keen at all on growth-driven blogging styles. You know the sort: listicles, SEO bait, etc. It’s low-grade, developers see through it, and it tarnishes the blogger’s image IMHO. That said, if you write a good blog, there’s no reason not to structure it such (“<em>Top Five Tips for Successful Developer Writing</em>”) but put the horse before the cart, not the other way around.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="recap">Recap&nbsp;<a href="#recap">🔗</a> </h2>
<p>To summarise this whole article, bear in mind that these two statements are not mutually exclusive:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write for yourself. Work out what <em>you</em> would like to read, and write it.</li>
<li>Think of the reader and what value you’re providing to them in your writing.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s because as a developer writing for developers, you <strong>are</strong> the reader.</p>
<p>Oh, and did you watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM">Larry McEnerney’s lecture</a> yet? 😊</p>

<p>Contemporary high-level programming languages and advanced compilers greatly simplify software development and lower its costs. However, this way of programming can hide the performance capabilities of modern hardware, partly due to inefficiencies of application programming interfaces (APIs). Apparently, a good old assembly code path can improve performance by between three and 94 times, depending on the workload, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/FFmpeg/status/1852542388851601913" data-url="https://x.com/FFmpeg/status/1852542388851601913" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">FFmpeg</a>. The hardware this multiplied performance was achieved on was not disclosed.</p><p>FFmpeg is an open-source video decoding project developed by volunteers who contribute to its codebase, fix bugs, and add new features. The project is led by a small group of core developers and maintainers who oversee its direction and ensure that contributions meet certain standards. They coordinate the project's development and release cycles, merging contributions from other developers. This group of developers tried to implement a handwritten AVX512 assembly code path, something that has rarely been done before, at least not in the video industry.</p><p>The developers have created an optimized code path using the AVX-512 instruction set to accelerate specific functions within the FFmpeg multimedia processing library. By leveraging AVX-512, they were able to achieve significant performance improvements — from three to 94 times faster — compared to standard implementations. AVX-512 enables processing large chunks of data in parallel using 512-bit registers, which can handle up to 16 single-precision FLOPS or 8 double-precision FLOPS in one operation. This optimization is ideal for compute-heavy tasks in general, but in the case of video and image processing in particular.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/benchmark" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/benchmark">benchmarking</a> results show that the new handwritten AVX-512 code path performs considerably faster than other implementations, including baseline C code and lower SIMD instruction sets like AVX2 and SSSE3. In some cases, the revamped AVX-512 codepath achieves a speedup of nearly 94 times over the baseline, highlighting the efficiency of hand-optimized assembly code for AVX-512.</p><p>This development is particularly valuable for users running on high-performance, AVX-512-capable hardware, enabling them to process media content far more efficiently. There is an issue, though: Intel disabled AVX-512 for its Core 12th, 13th, and 14th Generations of Core processors, leaving owners of these CPUs without them. On the other hand, AMD's Ryzen 9000-series CPUs feature a fully-enabled AVX-512 FPU so the owners of these processors can take advantage of the FFmpeg achievement.</p><p>Unfortunately, due to the complexity and specialized nature of AVX-512, such optimizations are typically reserved for performance-critical applications and require expertise in low-level programming and processor microarchitecture.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-SDpvGFrC3qiFsDcJ94h8pj"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div>

The average mineral content of calcium, magnesium, and iron in cabbage, lettuce, tomatoes, and spinach has dropped 80-90% between 1914 and 2018. </p><p><span>There are several reasons for this, but most of them are due to modern agricultural practices. These reasons include: selective breeding, soil depletion, synthetic fertilizers that provide basic nutrients necessary for plant growth but not others that would make them nutrient-dense, </span><a href="https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1647691634086215682" rel="">higher CO2 levels in atmosphere diluting nutrient content in plants</a><span>, over-irrigation washing away nutrients from soil, and long storage times.</span></p><p>2) If all you care about is nutrient content, SPEED is the only factor that matters. That means time between being picked and ending up in your mouth. Price doesn't matter, organic doesn't matter, marketing hoo-ha about how fancy the produce is doesn't matter. Literally just speed. Fresh spinach loses almost ALL of its vitamin C within 7 days of harvest when stored at 68°F (20°C). When stored at 39°F (4°C) which is about fridge temp, it loses 75%. The apples you buy at the grocery store can be up to a *year* old since they've been harvested, especially if you are not buying them in season.</p><p>Taste, texture, and smell are not good indicators of nutrient content, because you can't tell how long it has been since it's been harvested. Modern shipping and storage methods can be deceptive, combined with practices like spraying strawberry fragrance on otherwise bland strawberries so you think you're buying the good stuff (yes some places actually do this).</p><p>In general, it can help to eat in season, but due to the globalized supply chain...it's always in season *somewhere*. But how long did it take to get to you? You don't know. Even if it's in season where you are, how do you know if that's not from *last* season? Again, you have no idea.</p><p>3) Think for a moment: what store do you think sells the most nutritious produce? Your local farmers’ market? Whole Foods? Trader Joe’s must be decent, right? Nope, it’s Walmart. Because of their scale and insanely efficient supply chain, they can get things from the farm (wherever it is in the world it's growing in season) to the store where you can buy it, really really fast. Oh, and for the lowest cost.</p><p>I wanted to believe every time I splurged on fancier produce, I was actually getting something better. But this is what the data comparing 18 major US retailers showed — Walmart consistently outperformed.</p><p><span>I learned this from talking to Brent Overcash, co-founder of a startup called </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanabandoim/2020/03/02/what-is-really-in-your-food-teakorigin-guide-has-the-answers/" rel="">TeakOrigin</a><span>, which specialized in testing nutrient content in groceries from retail grocery stores. For years, every week, his team would walk into grocery stores, buy thousands of produce items the way normal consumers would, and bring them back to the lab to assess nutrient content. They’d go to Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, Costco, Wegmans, Sprouts, Waitrose, farmers’ markets, and many more retailers. The “winner” varied depending on the specific type of produce/brands/exactly what week it was, but Walmart tended to come out on top. The more important point is that price and taste and organic certifications had no impact on the actual nutrient density.</span></p><p>They raised ~$5M and did a decade of research with labs full of analytical chemists where they used a combination of molecular spectrometry, HPLC, GC/MS, TGA, and wet chemistry methods. With 800+ million data points, the USDA and FDA at one point told them they had the world’s largest dataset of dynamic nutrition data. They’re no longer around, but had branches in California, Boston, and the UK just a couple years ago.</p><p>It went out of business because no major grocery store wanted to partner with them, because the transparency would hold these retailers accountable for *so many things* the consumers aren't even currently aware of. Things like how Whole Foods centers their entire branding around fresher, higher quality produce that's better for you, but when he actually tested some expensive apples they were selling from a local orchard advertised with handwritten chalkboard signs, it had so little nutrient content it was barely detectable on their lab-grade machines. He called the orchard because he was curious, under the guise that he was interested in picking some apples for the season. They said, "Oh sure, you can do that, but our first harvest isn't for another 6 weeks." That means it had been a year since the apples he bought were actually picked. This is actually industry standard, made possible by storing them at low temperatures and spraying a gas called 1-MCP which blocks ethylene (a gas naturally produced by the apples that makes them ripen) by binding to the same receptors.</p><p>I asked him: Are farmers’ markets any better, since we're getting the produce directly from local farmers? And he said basically there's huge variance. If you walk into a booth and that vendor is selling over 5 types of produce, there's no way they all ripened at the same time. They may not even all be grown by them. Once, he actually saw a vendor at Boston farmers’ market selling carrots from Target! He could tell from the packaging because he used to work for them. Turns out when a produce delivery is refused by the grocery store, the truck owner is then responsible for getting rid of that produce, and they usually drive to a “food hub” where bulk produce is bought and sold just to recoup some of the costs. That is one possible source of the mysterious farmers’ market carrots they were pawning off as homegrown.</p><p>Now, I'm not saying you should *stop* shopping at non-Walmart places. There are a lot of factors other than nutrient density that influence a purchasing decision. The fancy, expensive produce might taste better, smell better, and be better for cooking. It may come from farms where there are better wages and working conditions. There might be fewer pesticides. But again, for nutrient content, speed is the only thing that matters.</p><p>I want to do something about this, but it’s an issue way bigger than I can tackle alone. From the way we do modern farming, to the complete lack of transparency on the retailer's end (and vested interests in keeping it that way), to the government's lack of interest in enforcing this transparency for the sake of consumers...the problem runs deep and I'm tired man. And so is Brent, who’s retired and doing woodworking in his studio these days, living the good life.</p><p><em>Side note on frozen produce: The post above is about fresh produce only. A potentially appealing alternative may be buying frozen produce, which on average has equal or higher nutritional content than fresh. This is because frozen produce is picked at peak ripeness then frozen shortly after, locking in most of the nutrients at the expense of appearance/texture/flavor. If it’s been blanched (i.e. exposed briefly to hot water or steam to preserve quality of produce by killing enzymes that cause loss of flavor, color, and texture) before freezing, some nutrients like Vitamin C, B1, and folate are definitely lower because of heat sensitivity and being water soluble so they leach out into the blanching water. Pretty much all frozen veggies are blanched first, and stuff like berries/fruit aren’t. The rest of the nutrients are quite stable, and knowing which ones are lost means you can supplement in other ways. Fresh produce is picked before peak ripeness to accommodate for ripening during storage and transport, and the nutrients degrade as it sits on shelves and in refrigerators before it is eventually prepared.</em></p><p><em>It’s also great that it’s more convenient, and I think frozen produce unfairly gets a bad rap. The only thing I would change is the plastic packaging because I don’t like microplastics in my food. I would avoid heating or microwaving produce in its original plastic packaging.</em></p><p><em>One thing to be aware of is frozen berries (or produce that isn’t blanched before freezing) that have been imported. In 2022-2023, New Zealand had a hepatitis A outbreak from frozen berries imported from Serbia so they advised people to boil/cook their berries before refreezing or eating. Some countries have more lax sanitation standards and contamination can happen in processing facilities. Furthermore, freezing doesn’t kill viruses! For stuff like berries which aren’t cooked before they’re eaten, you can more easily get sick. It’s less of a concern for berries sourced from within the US, Canada, Australia, most of the EU –&nbsp;but Australia has had 2 of the same hep A outbreaks so I’d just keep it in mind.</em></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

        <p>What does it mean to keep security in mind when writing Go code? Answering this question in one short article seems impossible. For this reason, we will narrow it down to a few specific practices.</p>
<p>They will lead to writing robust, secure and performant code when applied continuously.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we stay informed about the Go security announcements?</li>
<li>How do we keep our Go code patched and up to date?</li>
<li>How do we test our Go code focusing on security and robustness?</li>
<li>What are CVEs, and where do we learn about the most common software vulnerabilities?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mailing-list">Mailing list</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the most obvious place - the Go mailing list. We need to subscribe to get all critical security information right from the source.
All releases that contain security fixes are announced to the <code><a href="https://jarosz.dev/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="bcdbd3d0ddd2db91ddd2d2d3c9d2dfd9fcdbd3d3dbd0d9dbced3c9cccf92dfd3d1">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code> list.
Once we subscribe to the list, we can be sure we won’t miss any important announcements.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-go-version-up-to-date">Keeping Go version up to date</h2>
<p>The second step is to keep the Go versions in our projects current. Even though we don’t use the latest and greatest language features, bumping the Go version gives us all security patches for discovered vulnerabilities. Also, the new Go version ensures compatibility with newer dependencies.
It protects our applications from potential integration issues.</p>
<p>The third step is to learn which security issues and CVEs are addressed in what Go releases. We can check it on the Go release history website and then update it to the latest version in the <code>go.mod</code> files in our projects.</p>
<p>After upgrading to new versions of Go, we should ensure that the operation does not introduce compatibility and dependency problems, especially with third-party packages. It can be more risky when we work on large projects with tens and sometimes hundreds of direct and indirect package dependencies.</p>
<p>The point is to maintain the risk by eliminating potential dependency problems. The problems may include an urgent need to refactor the existing code to make it work with a new dependency. Examples of such issues include changed packages, APIs or function signatures.</p>

<p>We can concentrate on the project source code after we know we will use the Go version without security issues. We can start assessing code quality and security by employing static code analysers.</p>
<h3 id="vet">vet</h3>
<p>Before installing and using third-party analysers, it’s a good idea to use the Go “native” <code>go vet</code> command.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>go vet</code> command to analyse our Go code. The <code>go vet</code> command without arguments runs the tool with all options allowed by default. The tool scans the source code and reports potential issues. The issues include code syntax errors and certain programming constructs that can cause problems during program executions.</p>
<p>Most common issues include goroutine mistakes, unused variables and unreachable areas of the codebase. The main advantage of using the <code>go vet</code> command is that it is a part of the Go toolbox.</p>
<p>In a separate article, we will dive deeper into the <code>vet</code> details. The extensive documentation and examples are on the <code>go vet</code> <a href="https://golang.google.cn/cmd/vet/">website</a>.</p>
<h3 id="staticcheck">staticcheck</h3>
<p>Staticcheck is another static code analyser. It’s a third-party linter that helps to find bugs and detects possible performance problems. It also enforces Go language styling. It offers code simplifications, explains discovered issues and suggests corrections with examples.</p>
<p>Besides running staticcheck in a CI pipeline, we can install <code>staticcheck</code> on our laptops as a standalone binary and scan the code locally. Let’s install the latest version:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@latest
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>No errors on the terminal? If so, we are ready to run the scans. But first, let’s check the installed version to ensure everything looks good.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>staticcheck --version
</span></span><span><span>staticcheck 2024.1.1 <span>(</span>0.5.1<span>)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Similarly to the <code>go vet</code>, running <code>staticcheck</code> without arguments invokes all code analysers by default. This approach plays nicely with the UNIX programming philosophy of using sensible defaults and not forcing users to do unnecessary paperwork.</p>
<p>Let’s see what the tool can find in the <a href="https://github.com/nginx/agent">NGINX Agent</a> GitHub repository. First, we need to clone it:</p>
<p>Then, we can run it from the root directory of the project:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>➜  agent git:<span>(</span>main<span>)</span> ✗ staticcheck ./...
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After a short moment, we are ready to check the scanning results. We can categorise the listed examples into three groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>packages, methods or functions that are deprecated, for example:</li>
</ul>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>...
</span></span><span><span>src/core/metrics/sources/cpu.go:111:9: times.Total is deprecated: Total returns the total number of seconds in a CPUTimesStat Please <span>do</span> not use this internal <span>function</span>. <span>(</span>SA1019<span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span>...
</span></span><span><span>test/component/nginx-app-protect/monitoring/monitoring_test.go:15:8: <span>"github.com/golang/protobuf/jsonpb"</span> is deprecated: Use the <span>"google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson"</span> package instead. <span>(</span>SA1019<span>)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><ul>
<li>unused variables and fields, for example:</li>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, we are ready to start analysing the highlighted issues. A detailed deep dive into the codebase is outside this introductory article’s scope. We will do deeper code analysis, show examples, and fix security and performance issues in upcoming articles.</p>
<p>For now, let’s take note of CWE websites that contain tons of information about listed weaknesses so we can study them at a later time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unused variables</li>
<li>Using deprecated constructs</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="golangci-lint">golangci-lint</h3>
<p>The third code analyser we are going to employ is <code>golangci-lint</code>. As with all Go tools, we can install it in a variety of ways, including the <code>go install</code> command:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Let’s verify if the installation went well and check the version:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>golangci-lint --version
</span></span><span><span>golangci-lint has version v1.61.0 built with go1.23.2
</span></span><span><span>...
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Perfect! All looks good.</p>
<p>Following the same principle of the least surprise, <code>golangci-lint</code> runs all linters when we invoke it with no arguments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rule of Least Surprise: In interface design, always do the least surprising thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What happens when we check the cloned earlier <code>agent</code> repository? Will <code>golangci-lint</code> show us the same warnings and suggestions? Let’s find out.</p>
<p>As previously, we will start scanning the project from its root directory.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>➜  agent git:<span>(</span>main<span>)</span> ✗ golangci-lint run ./...
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Almost immediately, we noticed a list of suggestions for improving the code! For example:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>src/extensions/nginx-app-protect/monitoring/processor/nap_test.go:60:14: S1025: the argument is already a string, there<span>'</span>s no need to use fmt.Sprintf <span>(</span>gosimple<span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span> logEntry: fmt.Sprintf<span>(</span><span>`</span>%s<span>`</span>, func<span>()</span> string <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span> ^
</span></span></code></pre></div><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>src/plugins/common.go:85:5: S1009: should omit nil check; len<span>()</span> <span>for</span> <span>[]</span>string is defined as zero <span>(</span>gosimple<span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span> <span>if</span> loadedConfig.Extensions !<span>=</span> nil <span>&amp;&amp;</span> len<span>(</span>loadedConfig.Extensions<span>)</span> &gt; <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    ^
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The linter points to exact files and lines that need our attention. Our job now is to assess the code, make changes, run the liner a second time and run all unit tests. If the tests are green, we can commit updated code. Job done! Ok, we still need to push it to the remote.</p>
<h2 id="detecting-race-conditions">Detecting race conditions</h2>
<p>Race conditions in our programs and libraries can occur when multiple goroutines try to access a resource concurrently. These conditions
are detected when at least one goroutine tries to write (change) the resource. For example, the resource can be a global, package-level variable that acts as a counter.
This situation in a program can lead to subtle, very hard-to-diagnose and detect bugs.</p>
<p>Go has native support for testing such conditions. We run tests using the Go <code>test</code> tool with the argument <code>-race</code>.
This method will run the race detector and help identify problems in concurent programs.</p>
<p>There is one warning we need to remember. The detector can assess the executed code and will ignore code paths that are not executed. So, it’s crucial to run static code analysers first and make sure we do not have so-called dead code in our project.</p>
<p>When we tell Go: “Hey, run tests with the <code>-race</code> argument”, the Go compiler compiles the code with the race detector enabled. Then, tests are run, and possible race conditions are checked at runtime. When races are detected, the tool will print a detailed report. It will show what goroutines try to access which resources.</p>
<p>Another way to increase the chances of detecting concurrency issues is to run tests in parallel. To do so we need to inform the runner explicitly by adding <code>t.Parallel()</code> to our tests.</p>
<p>Two tests executed in parallel</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span><span>func</span> <span>TestParseDiskSpace</span>(<span>t</span> <span>*</span><span>testing</span>.<span>T</span>) {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>t</span>.<span>Parallel</span>()
</span></span><span><span>    <span>...</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span><span>func</span> <span>TestParseMemoryUsage</span>(<span>t</span> <span>*</span><span>testing</span>.<span>T</span>) {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>t</span>.<span>Parallel</span>()
</span></span><span><span>    <span>...</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Detecting race conditions and designing concurrent code is a vast and exciting topic that we will discuss in the future.</p>
<h2 id="scanning-source-code-for-vulnerabilities">Scanning source code for vulnerabilities</h2>
<h3 id="govulncheck">govulncheck</h3>
<p>We have a broad choice of tools that scan the codebase for known vulnerabilities listed in the <a href="https://www.cve.org/">CVEs</a> database.</p>
<p>Our default tool for ensuring we develop and release safe code is <code>govulncheck</code>. We can install it locally on a developer’s machine and run scans locally before committing and pushing our code to a remote Git repository.</p>
<p>Optionally, we can integrate the scanning step with CI pipelines in GitHub or GitLab. Then, the scan can be invoked on each merge request to ensure we do not introduce vulnerabilities in the project.</p>
<p><code>govulncheck</code> is developed by the Go team. A dedicated database of Go vulnerabilities provides information for the scanner.
Let’s install <code>govulncheck</code> locally and try basic functionality.</p>
<p>To install the latest version, we need to run the following command:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It’s time to check if the installation process went well:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>govulncheck -version
</span></span><span><span>Go: go1.23.2
</span></span><span><span>Scanner: <a href="https://jarosz.dev/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="dabdb5acafb6b4b9b2bfb9b19aacebf4ebf4e9">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>
</span></span><span><span>DB: https://vuln.go.dev
</span></span><span><span>DB updated: 2024-10-17 15:37:30 +0000 UTC
</span></span><span><span>...
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We are ready to run our first scan. Let’s clone the <a href="https://github.com/qba73/habit">habit</a> git repository. Then, navigate to its root directory and run the tool.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>➜  habit git:<span>(</span>main<span>)</span> ✗ govulncheck
</span></span><span><span>No vulnerabilities found.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It looks promising! We did not find vulnerabilities in the source code. Are we done? Not really! We built the habit binary when the <code>go.mod</code> file defined the version of Go 1.18. The current version is v1.23.2.</p>
<p>Let’s scan the habit binary, not the source code.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>➜  habit git:<span>(</span>main<span>)</span> ✗ govulncheck -mode binary -show verbose habit
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We run <code>govulncheck</code> in the binary mode. It means that we can scan any Go binary we have access to! We do not need source code! Then, we run the scan in the verbose mode. It will show the complete report broken into multiple sections. The last argument is the name of the binary we want to scan.</p>
<p>Hmmm! This report does look different! What just happened?</p>

<h3 id="gosec">gosec</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/securego/gosec"><code>gosec</code></a> is a static code analyzer. It helps to find insecure code constructs.
We can install it locally on our laptops or run it as a GitHub Action in a CI pipeline. As described earlier, <code>golangci-lint</code> includes the <code>gosec</code> as a plugin and runs it as default on each code scan.</p>
<p>Let’s give it a try and install the scanner locally.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>go install github.com/securego/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec@latest
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If we do not see errors, <code>gosec</code> is ready for action. Before running our first scan, let’s look at the menu:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>gosec -h
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>gosec - Golang security checker
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>gosec analyses Go source code to look <span>for</span> common programming mistakes that
</span></span><span><span>can lead to security problems.
</span></span><span><span>...
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We can use a long list of options and rules to configure the scanner behaviour. Going into details of specific options is outside of the scope of this article. A detailed tutorial on configuring, running and benefiting from this SAST tool is coming soon! Stay tuned!</p>
<p>To try gosec, we need to clone a GitHub repository with the Go code we want to scan.</p>
<p>Let’s clone the <a href="https://github.com/CyberRoute/bruter">brutus</a> repository. It’s an open-source experimental <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence">OSINT</a> app for testing web server configuration.</p>
<p>Next, change our current directory to the project’s root directory and start scanning.</p>
<p>After a couple of seconds, <code>gosec</code> presents the scan report. What can we learn immediately? We see a list of potential issues sorted by severity and confidence.
We know what part of the code needs attention and what weakness classification the issue applies to. Perfect! What’s next?</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>...

</span></span><span><span>...
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>At this stage of our investigation, we can check reported CWEs and learn about details of listed weaknesses. For example, the second listed issue brings us to the <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html">CWE-295</a> website, where we can learn more about vulnerability.</p>
<h2 id="fuzzing">Fuzzing</h2>
<p>The last method of checking code quality and discovering vulnerabilities is fuzz testing. Fuzzing is a special kind of automated testing. It uses code test coverage to manipulate randomly generated input data.</p>
<p>It’s extremely helpful in finding potential security flaws like buffer overflows, <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection">SQL injections</a>, <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Denial_of_Service">DoS attacks</a> and <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">XSS attacks</a>. The most crucial attribute of fuzzing is that many input combinations are generated automatically! Developers don’t need to scratch their heads trying to figure out hundreds, if not thousands, of input data combinations! What a relief!</p>
<p>We will focus on fuzzing in more detail in upcoming tutorials.</p>
<p>Most of the methods and testing techniques we discussed today are encouraged by <a href="https://openssf.org/best-practices-badge/">OpenSSF</a> foundation. Open source projects that want to get the Best Practice Badge are required to meet <a href="https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/criteria/0">FLOSS criteria</a> in areas like licencing, change control, vulnerability reporting, quality, security and static and dynamic security code analysis.</p>
<p>Stay secure, free from CVEs and enjoy programming!</p>
<p>As <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/">John Arundel</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Programming is fun, and you should have fun!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Till next time!</p>

            <p><em>Vogue</em> is an RIAA-certified triple-platinum hit, selling over six million copies since its 1991 release on the "I'm Breathless" album by pop mega-star <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna?ref=seekhifi.com">Madonna</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(Madonna_song)?ref=seekhifi.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>Vogue</em></a> topped charts in Australia, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It has been sampled by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Minogue?ref=seekhifi.com">Kylie Minogue</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc%C3%A9?ref=seekhifi.com">Beyoncé</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariana_Grande?ref=seekhifi.com">Ariana Grande</a>. David Fincher (yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fincher?ref=seekhifi.com#Filmography">that David Fincher</a>) directed the provocative and iconic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuJQSAiODqI&amp;ref=seekhifi.com">music video</a>. <em>Vogue </em>also possibly resurrected disco from its commercial death in the late 70s and helped bring house music into the mainstream.</p><p>I don't care about any of that.</p><p>HERE'S THE DEAL: pound-for-pound, <em>Vogue</em> is one of the most remarkable examples of artificial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereophonic_sound?ref=seekhifi.com">stereophonic sound</a> ever produced. Let's strike a pose, er, have a listen.</p><hr><hr><p>Stereophonic sound is typically what people mean when saying "stereo." It uses separate sound sources to give the illusion of sound in a 3-D dimensional space as perceived by our ears. "Natural" stereophonic sound is recorded and reproduced with arrays of microphones and speakers. That's not what <em>Vogue</em> is.</p><p><em>Vogue</em>'s incredible soundscape is entirely artificial. It was not recorded by an array of microphones placed around a band. There was no band. There was no dance floor. There was QSound. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QSound?ref=seekhifi.com">Wikipedia</a>:</p><blockquote>QSound is essentially a filtering algorithm. It manipulates timing, amplitude, and frequency response to produce a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_recording?ref=seekhifi.com">binaural image</a>. Systems like QSound rely on the fact that a sound arriving from one side of the listener will reach one ear before the other and that when it reaches the furthest ear, it is lower in amplitude and spectrally altered due to obstruction by the head.</blockquote><p>QSound was only used on a handful of albums in the early 90s. Its remarkable ability to place sounds in a 3-D space was quickly iterated upon and has since found widespread usage in video game development. If you've ever been blown away by surround sound from a gaming headset, it was likely some form of QSound or something related.</p><p>The music recording industry moved on to other production methods. Still, <em>Vogue</em> remains a unique time capsule of state-of-the-art audio technology deployed by masters of the craft.</p><p>The track starts with a startling, sweeping vocal line, "What are you looking at?" that pans around our heads like Michael Bay's camera, setting the stage (literally) for what's about to come. Sustained synth chords gently surround, laying the foundation for sharp snaps in front and to the right. A Roland TR-909 drum machine starts far in the distance on the left before a meaty bass line gets its groove on. This is house music exploding to the top of all the charts.</p><p>The song's main vocal comes in at 1:22, giving plenty of time to fill the dance floor. But come in, it does. Madonna's vocals on <em>Vogue</em> sound so freaking cool. It's like she's in my head, but if my head was the size of a symphony hall. The voice of god. Backing vocals feint and doge, appearing with impressive effect from all angles and orientations. One of my favorite vocal moments is at 3:15 with the delightfully corny (or perhaps deeply philosophical) line, "Beauty's where you find it, not just where you bump and grind it." The wall of voices here is astounding from the sweet spot between two loudspeakers or on a good set of cans.</p><p>The keyboard and drum machine programming and mixing throughout the song is a blast. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)?ref=seekhifi.com"><em>Jurassic Park</em></a> of audio effects. Many people worked on the track, but much credit goes to 80's remix master <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shep_Pettibone?ref=seekhifi.com">Shep Pettibone</a>, who produced with Madonna. Oodles of little details and layered moments reward a close listen. It's an impressive display of realized artistic vision and craft by true medium masters.</p><p><em>Vogue</em> is an exceptional pop song with sonic and cultural depth for those who care to engage critically but also somehow remains a mile wide. Decades after its release, <em>Vogue </em>still fills dance floors at concerts, weddings, and house parties. Madonna reinvented herself many times throughout her career, but <em>Vogue</em> has rarely been left off the set list. It stands as a towering pop-art achievement in mainstream music-making.</p><hr><h3 id="data">Data</h3><p><strong>Song</strong>: Vogue<br><strong>Album</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Breathless?ref=seekhifi.com">I'm Breathless</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Immaculate_Collection?ref=seekhifi.com" rel="noreferrer">The Immaculate Collection</a><br><strong>Artist</strong>: Madonna<br><strong>Genre</strong>: Pop, Dance, House<br><strong>Year</strong>: 1990<br><strong>Length</strong>: 5:17<br><strong>Composer</strong>: Madonna, Shep Pettibone <br><strong>Producer</strong>: Madonna, Shep Pettibone</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Treating anxiety, depression and other disorders may depend on the amygdala, a part of the brain that controls strong emotional reactions, especially fear. But a deep understanding of this structure has been lacking. Now scientists at the University of California, Davis have identified new clusters of cells with differing patterns of gene expression in the amygdala of humans and non-human primates. The work could lead to more targeted treatments for disorders such as anxiety that affect tens of millions of people.&nbsp;</p><p>The work is published Oct. 30 in the <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.20230602">American Journal of Psychiatry</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“The amygdala is central to emotion processing in the brain, and is known to contribute to fear and anxiety,” said Drew Fox, associate professor in the UC Davis Department of Psychology and senior author on the paper.</p><p>For that reason, there has long been interest in whether variations in the size or structure of the amygdala are related to disorders such as anxiety and depression. However, it’s increasingly clear that the overall size and structure of the amygdala is not a good predictor of emotional problems in life, Fox said.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, research in rodents has shown that each subregion of the amygdala contains many different cell types with distinct and sometimes opposing functions.&nbsp;</p><p>“This suggests that disorders emerge from alterations in specific cell types with distinct roles,” Fox said. However, it is challenging to identify such cell types in humans or other primates, leaving the cellular landscape of the primate amygdala largely unexplored.&nbsp;</p><p>To address this critical knowledge gap, graduate student Shawn Kamboj led a collaboration between Fox’s research group and the lab of Professor Cynthia Schumann at the UC Davis School of Medicine to identify cell types in subregions of the human and non-human primate amygdala, based on the genes they express. This could advance basic research by making it easier to translate results between rodents, non-human primates and humans, and open up new targets for treatment.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Single cell RNA sequencing</strong></h2><p>The researchers took samples from brains of humans and rhesus macaque monkeys, separated individual cells and sequenced their RNA. This shows which genes are active (being expressed) in a particular cell and allows researchers to sort them into groups based on gene expression.&nbsp;</p><p>“We can cluster cells based on their gene expression, identify cell types and their developmental origin,” Fox said.&nbsp;</p><p>The researchers searched for specific cell types that expressed the genes implicated in anxiety and other disorders in humans. This strategy can help identify cell types that are most likely to give rise to psychopathology, Fox said.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, they identified a specific group of cells that expressed a gene called FOXP2. The new study shows that in humans and macaques, FOXP2 is expressed in cells on the edges of the amygdala, called intercalated cells. Excitingly, researchers have demonstrated that in rodents, this small group of FOXP2-expressing cells play a role as “gatekeepers," controlling signal traffic in or out of the amygdala. Together, these data suggest intercalated cells to be a potentially powerful avenue for developing treatments.</p><p>The researchers were also able to identify both similarities and differences between cell types in the human and non-human primate amygdala. This is important for understanding how discoveries in animal models of disorders such as anxiety and autism relate to humans.&nbsp;</p><p>The approach could help identify cell types as potential drug targets. For example, FOXP2-expressing cells tend to express both anxiety-related genes and a receptor that can be targeted by drugs, called Neuropeptide FF Receptor 2 (NPFFR2). This result can guide the development of new treatment strategies, by suggesting drugs that activate the NPFFR2 pathway as a potential treatment target in relation to anxiety-related disorders.&nbsp;</p><p>Anxiety is a complicated disorder that can present in many different ways. With a better understanding of the cell types involved, it may be possible to identify and target “chokepoints” that affect large numbers of people who experience extreme and debilitating anxiety, Fox said.&nbsp;</p><p>“Put simply, if we’re developing a drug to target the amygdala, we want to know which cell type we are targeting,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Additional authors on the paper are: Erin Carlson, Kari Hanson and Bradley Ander, UC Davis MIND Institute; Julie Fudge, University of Rochester; Melissa Bauman, California National Primate Research Center; Karl Murray, UC Davis School of Medicine. The work was supported by the California National Primate Research Center and grants from the NIH and the Simons Foundation.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

Here are two examples: Caslon and Bifur. Caslon is an alphabet designed as far back as 1725 by William Caslon. It appears to be a good choice because it is both elegant and bookish, qualities well suited for educational purposes.</p> <p>Bifur, a novelty face by A. M. Cassandre, was designed as recently as 1929. An unconventional but ingenious design, it has the advantage, to some, of visually implying advanced technology. <em>(Attributing certain magical qualities to particular typefaces is, however, largely a subjective matter.)</em></p> </div> <div> <p><a href="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2004.jpg" data-fancybox="images" role="link"><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2004-450.jpg" alt="NeXT Computers" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2004-450.jpg"></a><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/img/icon-zoom-boxed.svg" width="40" height="40" alt="Zoom"></p> </div> <div><p>One reason for looking at a number of possible typefaces is to satisfy one’s curiosity. Another, and perhaps more meaningful one, is to study the relationship of different letter combinations, to look for visual analogies, and to try to elicit ideas that the design of a letter or group of letters might inspire.</p> <p>Here are some further choices, but no matter how one may look at these different examples: sans serifs, hairline and slab serifs, condensed, expanded, bold, light, outline… they still say <em>next</em>… like <em>next time, what’s next?, next in line,</em> or even <em>next of kin</em>. The word is in such common usage that it is simply taken for granted.</p> <p>Personal preferences, prejudices, and stereotypes often dictate what a logo looks like, but it is <em>needs</em>, not wants, <em>ideas</em>, not type styles which determine what its form should be. To defamiliarize it, to make it look different, to let it evoke more than the mere adjective or adverb it happens to be is, it seems, the nub of the problem.</p> </div> <div> <p><a href="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2005.jpg" data-fancybox="images" role="link"><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2005-450.jpg" alt="NeXT Computers" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2005-450.jpg"></a><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/img/icon-zoom-boxed.svg" width="40" height="40" alt="Zoom"></p> </div> <div><p>Set in all capitals, the word NEXT is sometimes confused with EXIT possibly because the EXT grouping is so dominant. A combination of capitals and lower case letters alleviates this problem.</p> <p>Here are some possibilities which explore the use of lower case letters.</p> <p>The e is differentiated so as to provide a focal point and visual contrast among the capital letters which, otherwise, consist only of straight lines.</p> <p>Happily, the e also could stand for:<br> education<br> excellence<br> expertise<br> exceptional<br> excitement<br> e=mc2<br> etc.</p> </div> <div> <p><a href="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2006.jpg" data-fancybox="images" role="link"><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2006-450.jpg" alt="NeXT Computers" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2006-450.jpg"></a><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/img/icon-zoom-boxed.svg" width="40" height="40" alt="Zoom"></p> </div> <div><p>Note the difference that the lower case e makes when compared with the capital E. By means of contrast both interest and readability are achieved. This is particularly noticeable in the illustration at the bottom.</p> <p>These simple, geometric letters make it easier to exploit and manipulate possible visual ideas than do more complex serifed letters.</p> </div> <div> <p><a href="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2007.jpg" data-fancybox="images" role="link"><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2007-450.jpg" alt="NeXT Computers" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2007-450.jpg"></a><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/img/icon-zoom-boxed.svg" width="40" height="40" alt="Zoom"></p> </div> <div><p>Ideally, a logo should explain or suggest the business it symbolizes, but this is rarely possible or even necessarv.There is nothing about the IBM symbol, for example, that suggests computers, except what the viewer reads into it. Stripes are now associated with computers because the initials of a great computer company happen to be striped.This is equally true of the ABC symbol which does not suggest TV. The mnemonic factors in both logps are graphic devices: stripes and circles.</p> <p>In this example the e is the mnemonic factor.</p> </div> <div> <p><a href="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2008.jpg" data-fancybox="images" role="link"><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2008-450.jpg" alt="NeXT Computers" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2008-450.jpg"></a><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/img/icon-zoom-boxed.svg" width="40" height="40" alt="Zoom"></p> </div> <div><p>A logo takes on meaning, only if over a period of time it is linked to some product or service of a particular organization. What is needed is finding a meaningful device, some idea that reinforces the memorability of the company name. A black cube can be such a device because it has visual impact, and is easy to remember. Unlike the word Next, it is depictable, possesses the <em>promise of meaning</em>, and the <em>pleasure of recognition.</em></p> <p>This idea in no way restricts its application to any one product or concept.<br> The three dimensional effect functions as an underscore to attract the viewer s attention.</p> </div> <div> <p><a href="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2009.jpg" data-fancybox="images" role="link"><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2009-450.jpg" alt="NeXT Computers" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2009-450.jpg"></a><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/img/icon-zoom-boxed.svg" width="40" height="40" alt="Zoom"></p> </div> <div><p>It is desirable to keep the letter style simple, unmannered, and untrendy so as not to distract from the cube concept. Furthermore, the use of a single identification device and a simple sans serif letter, designed to harmonize with almost any accompanying typeface, is essential for practical application. Whenever possible, double identification (name plus symbol) is best avoided.The brevity of the word NeXT and its containment within the framework of the cube obviates the need for such awkward devices.</p> <p>Splitting the logo into two lines accomplishes several things: it startles the viewer and gives the word a new look, thus making it easier to separate from common usage. And even more importantly, it increases the letter size two-fold, within the framework of the cube. For small space use, a one line logo would have been too small to fit within this same framework.</p> <p>Readability is hardly affected because the word is too simple to be misread.<br> Moreover, people have become accustomed to this format with such familiar four- letter word combinations as<br> LO<br> VE</p> </div> <div> <p><a href="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2010.jpg" data-fancybox="images" role="link"><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2010-450.jpg" alt="NeXT Computers" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://assets.paulrand.design/Works/NeXT/Logo%20Book/Web/NeXT%2010-450.jpg"></a><img loading="lazy" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/img/icon-zoom-boxed.svg" width="40" height="40" alt="Zoom"></p> </div> <div><p>In its design, color arrangement, and orientation the logo is a study in contrasts. Kipped at a jaunty angle, it brims with the informality, friendliness, and spontaneity of a Christmas seal and the authority of a rubber stamp.Together with its lively, black silhouette it becomes a focal point difficult for the eyes to avoid.</p> <p>The unconventional, yet dignified, array of colors: vermilion against cerise and green, and yellow against black (the most intense color contrast possible) is designed to appeal to a youthful audience and to add a sparkling, jew’el-like touch to paper, package, or machine. It is the sparing use of brilliant colors on a predominantly black ground that produces this effect, like stars in the sky.

Whilst they are known within the field, rarely are they known outside the field or widely, yet should be.</em></p><p><span>If you've heard of the </span><strong>Turing Test</strong><span>, you've undoubtedly heard of Alan Turing. But in the same breath, you might also encounter the lesser-known name, </span><strong>Alonzo Church</strong><span>. When we review the ‘popular’ history of computing and Artificial Intelligence, it’s often Turing’s name that receives the spotlight, but the collaboration upon which Turing performed much of his groundbreaking work was aided and shaped by Church. Alonzo Church's work profoundly influenced Alan Turing's thinking and played a decisive role in the development of the Turing Test. Furthermore, without Church's contributions to the understanding of computation, our current conceptions of artificial intelligence and the tests, which have considerably evolved, to evaluate it may likely be very different.</span></p><p><span>Born on June 14, 1903, in Washington, D.C., Alonzo Church was a quiet, soft-spoken logician whose impact on mathematics and computing was monumental, even though he never sought acclaim. Little is known of his early life, however, it was marked by challenges, an air gun incident in his childhood left him </span><a href="https://builds.openlogicproject.org/content/history/biographies/alonzo-church.pdf" rel="">blind in one eye</a><a href="#_ftn1" rel="">[1]</a><span>. Despite this, he thrived academically. Church finished preparatory school in Connecticut in 1920 and began his university education at Princeton that same year, where he completed his doctoral studies in 1927. After spending time at Harvard and abroad as a National Research Fellow in Göttingen, and Amsterdam, Church returned to Princeton, where he would build much of his academic legacy. </span><strong>Church was known for his exceedingly polite demeanor and meticulous nature</strong><span>. His blackboard writing was immaculate, and he was known to cover important papers in </span><a href="https://builds.openlogicproject.org/content/history/biographies/alonzo-church.pdf" rel="">Duco</a><span> cement to preserve them, a reflection of his careful and deliberate approach to both scholarship and life.</span></p><p><strong>Did you know</strong><span> that despite his immense contributions to computer science, much of Alonzo Church's early life remains relatively unknown? Unlike some of his more famous contemporaries, his personal history hasn't been extensively documented, adding to the air of mystery surrounding this intellectual giant.</span></p><p><span>Despite his reserved demeanor and personal challenges, </span><strong>Church's intellectual contributions were nothing short of revolutionary.</strong></p><p>Church’s most profound contribution was the “λ-calculus,” a formal system that served as the bedrock of computer science before computer science even had a name. In 1936, Alonzo Church formulated what is now known as the Church-Turing thesis, a concept fundamental to theoretical computer science that states any function that can be effectively computed can be computed by a Turing machine or its equivalent. This thesis was groundbreaking, as it provided the framework within which to understand what machines could theoretically do, but also highlighted the boundaries of algorithmic processes. While foundational, the Church-Turing thesis also has limitations and has been subject to debate, particularly concerning the interpretation of 'effective computability' and its implications for physical computation and the nature of human intelligence.</p><p><span>Where Turing proposed his eponymous machine, a model meant to exemplify how mechanical procedures could be translated into logical form, Church provided the pure abstraction that made such a machine theoretically sound. The λ-calculus was almost mystical in its generality and elegance</span><a href="#_ftn2" rel="">[2]</a><span>. The influence of λ-calculus can be seen in the very principles of how programs are written today, emphasizing composition, higher-order functions, and immutability. This formalism allowed abstract mathematical problems to be codified and ultimately solved mechanically, and became essential to the architecture of modern compilers and interpreters. His work posed and solved problems about the limits of mathematical procedures, effectively asking: </span><strong>“To what extent can machines replicate human thought?”</strong></p><p><span>In addition to λ-calculus, Church made important contributions to other areas of logic and philosophy, such as his work on the </span><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem" rel="">Entscheidungsproblem</a></strong><span>, a decision problem posed by David Hilbert in 1928 that asked whether there exists a definitive algorithm to determine the truth of any mathematical statement. Church answered this question negatively, showing that such an algorithm does not exist, which became known as Church's Theorem. This finding profoundly influenced decision theory and underscored the limits of what could be achieved with computation alone.</span></p><p><span>Church was also a mentor to some of the greatest logicians and computer scientists of his time. His academic offspring included luminaries such as Stephen Kleene, J. Barkley Rosser, and perhaps most notably, Alan Turing, who completed his Ph.D. under Church's supervision at Princeton. </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/01445349708837290?needAccess=true" rel="">David Kaplan</a><span> says that he used always to recommend that his new graduate students sit in on a class with Church, telling them: </span><strong>“Take a class from Professor Church. It will change you. And even if you are not interested in pursuing the subjects he teaches, you will tell your grandchildren.” </strong></p><p>During the 1930s, Princeton was an intellectual epicenter for the development of modern logic, with influential figures such as John von Neumann and Kurt Gödel alongside Church. The symmetry of Church's mentorship and Turing's later achievements creates a hidden but potent partnership, an invisible bridge that helped carry humanity from mechanical calculation to computational intelligence.</p><p><strong>Did you know that Alonzo Church was already a professor at Princeton University by the age of 26?</strong><span> He joined the faculty in 1929, shortly after completing his Ph.D., showcasing his rapid ascent in academia.</span></p><p><span>Despite his massive intellectual contributions, Alonzo Church never enjoyed the fame of Turing or von Neumann, Gödel and others. His legacy was one of meticulous abstraction, a kind that doesn’t make it into Hollywood scripts or capture public imagination easily. It lacked the heroism of wartime codebreaking or the evocative tragedy of an early (</span><em>forced</em><span>) death. Yet, </span><strong>Church's influence is indelible</strong><span>. The very programs that run on the billions of smartphones today can trace their logic back to the abstract functions of λ-calculus. </span><strong>The invisible DNA of computation, from the simple app to artificial intelligence, owes a significant part of its lineage to Church’s work.</strong></p><p><span>Why, then, should we know him? Perhaps because our reverence for brilliance is often biased toward the visible, the concrete, and the heroic. Alonzo Church’s genius was of a different kind, it was the genius of the unseen, of the rigorous structure without which the edifice could not stand. His work forms a foundational part of the theoretical basis for many of the digital interactions we take for granted, influencing the development of computer science and the algorithmic processes that shape our daily computerised interactions. </span><strong>To know Church is to understand that genius doesn’t always reside in spectacle but sometimes in quiet, unassuming elegance</strong><span>, in the formulas scribbled on a blackboard that, eventually, reshape the world.</span></p><p>With the tremendous breakthroughs we are seeing in artificial intelligence, we would do well to know more about, and celebrate, the foundational figures such as Alonzo Church who made it all possible.</p><p>Stay curious, </p><p>dr Colin W.P.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>Most programmers have an intimate understanding of CPUs and sequential programming because they grow up writing code for the CPU, but many are less familiar with the inner workings of GPUs and what makes them so special. Over the past decade, GPUs have become incredibly important because of their pervasive use in deep learning. Today, it is essential for every software engineer to possess a basic understanding of how they work. My goal with this article is to give you that background.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em><span>Much of this article is based on the book “</span><a href="https://shop.elsevier.com/books/programming-massively-parallel-processors/hwu/978-0-323-91231-0" rel="">Programming Massively Parallel Processors</a><span>”, 4th edition by Hwu et al. As the book covers Nvidia GPUs, I will also be talking about Nvidia GPUs and using Nvidia specific terminology. However, the fundamental concepts and approach to GPU programming apply to other vendors as well.</span></em></p></blockquote><p><span>⚡️</span><strong>Announcement — Upcoming Live Session</strong><span>⚡️</span><strong>: </strong><em>I’m doing a live session on building a bytecode compiler and VM for a small subset of Python in Python. Join if you are interested.</em></p><p>We will start by doing a comparison between CPU and GPU which will give us a better vantage point of the GPU landscape. However, this is a topic of its own and we cannot possibly squeeze everything in one section. So, we will stick to a few key points.</p><p><span>The major difference between CPUs and GPUs is in their design goals. CPUs were designed to execute sequential instructions</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-137892185" href="https://blog.codingconfessions.com/p/gpu-computing#footnote-1-137892185" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span>. To improve their sequential execution performance, many features have been introduced in the CPU design over the years. The emphasis has been on reducing the instruction execution latency so that CPUs can execute a sequence of instructions as fast as possible. This includes features like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_pipelining" rel="">instruction pipelining</a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_execution" rel="">out of order execution</a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_execution" rel="">speculative execution</a><span> and multilevel caches (just to list a few).</span></p><p>GPUs on the other hand have been designed for massive levels of parallelism and high throughput, at the cost of medium to high instruction latency. This design direction has been influenced by their use in video games, graphics, numerical computing, and now deep learning. All of these applications need to perform a ton of linear algebra and numerical computations at a very fast rate, because of which a lot of attention has gone into improving the throughput of these devices.</p><p>Let’s consider a concrete example. A CPU can add two numbers much faster than the GPU because of its low instruction latency. They will be able to do several of such computations in a sequence faster than a GPU. However, when it comes to doing millions or billions of such computations, a GPU will do those computations much much faster than a CPU because of its sheer massive parallelism.</p><p>If you like numbers, let’s talk about numbers. The performance of hardware for numerical computations is measured in terms of how many floating point operations it can do per second (FLOPS). The Nvidia Ampere A100 offers a throughput of 19.5 TFLOPS for 32-bit precision. In comparison, the throughput of an Intel 24-core processor is 0.66 TFLOPS for 32-bit precision (these numbers are from 2021). And, this gap in the throughput performance between GPUs and CPUs has been growing wider with each passing year.</p><p>The following figure compares the architectures of CPUs and GPUs.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e81d6e3-f38b-49d3-995b-a334fb38394f_1456x719.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e81d6e3-f38b-49d3-995b-a334fb38394f_1456x719.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e81d6e3-f38b-49d3-995b-a334fb38394f_1456x719.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e81d6e3-f38b-49d3-995b-a334fb38394f_1456x719.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e81d6e3-f38b-49d3-995b-a334fb38394f_1456x719.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e81d6e3-f38b-49d3-995b-a334fb38394f_1456x719.png" width="1456" height="719" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2e81d6e3-f38b-49d3-995b-a334fb38394f_1456x719.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:719,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Figure 1: A comparison of the CPU and GPU chip design.

They use a very small amount of the chip area for caches and control units, the things which reduce the latency for CPUs.</p><p>You might wonder, how do the GPUs tolerate high latencies and yet provide high performance. This is made possible by the large number of threads and massive compute power that the GPUs have. Even if individual instructions have high latency, GPUs efficiently schedule threads for execution such that they are utilizing the compute power at every point in time. For instance, while some threads are waiting for the result of an instruction, the GPU will switch to executing other non-waiting threads. This ensures that the the compute units on the GPU are operating at their max capacity at all points of time, thus providing high throughput. We will get a clearer picture of this later when we discuss how a kernel executes on the GPU.</p><p>So we understand GPUs favor high throughput but what does their architecture look like which enables them to achieve this, let’s discuss in this section.</p><p>A GPU consists of an array of streaming multiprocessors (SM). Each of these SMs in turn consists of several streaming processors or cores or threads. For instance, the Nvidia H100 GPU has 132 SMs with 64 cores per SM, totalling a whopping 8448 cores.</p><p>Each SM has a limited amount of on-chip memory, often referred to as shared memory or a scratchpad, which is shared among all the cores. Likewise, the control unit resources on the SM are shared by all the cores. Additionally, each SM is equipped with hardware-based thread schedulers for executing threads.</p><p>Apart from these, each SM also has several functional units or other accelerated compute units such as tensor cores, or ray tracing units to serve specific compute demands of the workload that the GPU caters to.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f4c3f5e-1d1c-4556-8c7e-2725cc82d2df_971x593.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f4c3f5e-1d1c-4556-8c7e-2725cc82d2df_971x593.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f4c3f5e-1d1c-4556-8c7e-2725cc82d2df_971x593.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f4c3f5e-1d1c-4556-8c7e-2725cc82d2df_971x593.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f4c3f5e-1d1c-4556-8c7e-2725cc82d2df_971x593.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f4c3f5e-1d1c-4556-8c7e-2725cc82d2df_971x593.png" width="971" height="593" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0f4c3f5e-1d1c-4556-8c7e-2725cc82d2df_971x593.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:593,&quot;width&quot;:971,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Figure 2: The GPU Compute Architecture&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="Figure 2: The GPU Compute Architecture" title="Figure 2: The GPU Compute Architecture" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f4c3f5e-1d1c-4556-8c7e-2725cc82d2df_971x593.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f4c3f5e-1d1c-4556-8c7e-2725cc82d2df_971x593.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f4c3f5e-1d1c-4556-8c7e-2725cc82d2df_971x593.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f4c3f5e-1d1c-4556-8c7e-2725cc82d2df_971x593.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Figure 2: The GPU Compute Architecture</figcaption></figure></div><p>Next, let’s breakdown the GPU memory and look inside.</p><p>The GPU has several layers of different kinds of memories, with each having their specific use case.

Each SM in the GPU has a large number of registers. For instance, the Nvidia A100, and H100 models have 65,536 registers per SM. These registers are shared between the cores, and are allocated to them dynamically depending on the requirement of the threads. During execution the registers allocated to a thread are private to it, i.e., other threads cannot read/write those registers.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Constant Caches:</strong><span> Next, we have constant caches on the chip. These are used to cache constant data used by the code executing on the SM. To utilize these caches, programmers have to explicitly declare objects as constants in the code so that the GPU may cache and keep them in the constant cache.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Shared Memory:</strong><span> Each SM also has a shared memory or scratchpad which is a small amount of fast and low latency on-chip programmable SRAM memory. It is designed to be shared by a block of threads running on the SM. The idea behind shared memory is that if multiple threads need to work with the same piece of data, only one of them should load it from the global memory, while others will share it. Careful usage of shared memory can cut down redundant load operations from global memory, and improve the kernel execution performance. Another usage of the shared memory is as a synchronization mechanism between threads executing within a block.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>L1 Cache:</strong><span> Each SM also has an L1 cache which can cache frequently accessed data from L2 cache.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>L2 Cache:</strong><span> There is an L2 cache which is shared by all SMs. It caches the frequently accessed data from the global memory to cut down the latency. Note that both L1 and L2 caches are transparent to the SM, i.e., the SM doesn’t know it is getting data from L1 or L2. As far as the SM is concerned, it is getting data from the global memory. This is similar to how L1/L2/L3 caches work in CPUs.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Global Memory:</strong><span> The GPU also has an off-chip global memory, which is a high capacity and high bandwidth DRAM. For instance, the Nvidia H100 has 80 GB high bandwidth memory (HBM) with bandwidth of 3000 GB/second. Due to being far away from the SMs, the latency of global memory is quite high. However, the several additional layers of on-chip memories, and high number of compute units help hide this latency.</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/codeconfessions&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Support me by buying me a coffee!&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/codeconfessions" rel=""><span>Support me by buying me a coffee!</span></a></p></li></ul><p>Now that we know about the key components of the GPU hardware, let’s go one step deeper and understand how these components come into picture when executing code.</p><p>To understand how the GPU executes a kernel, we first need to understand what a kernel is and what its configurations are. Let’s start there.</p><p>CUDA is the programming interface provided by Nvidia for writing programs for their GPUs. In CUDA you express a computation that you want to run on the GPU in the form similar to a&nbsp; C/C++ function and this function is called a kernel. The kernel operates on vectors of numbers in parallel which are provided to it as function parameters. A simple example would be a kernel to perform vector addition, i.e., a kernel that takes two vectors of numbers as inputs, adds them element-wise and writes the result to a third vector.&nbsp;</p><p>To execute a kernel on the GPU, we need to launch a number of threads which is collectively referred to as a grid. But there is more structure to the grid. A grid consists of one or more thread blocks (sometimes simply called as blocks) and each block consists of one or more threads.</p><p>The number of blocks and threads depends on the size of the data and the amount of parallelism we want. For instance, in our vector addition example, if we are adding vectors of dimension 256, then we may decide to configure a single thread block of 256 threads so that each thread operates on one element of the vector. For bigger problems, we may not have enough threads available on the GPU and we might want each thread to handle multiple data points.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b44282-f064-478e-84b4-0c44664c1630_1600x760.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b44282-f064-478e-84b4-0c44664c1630_1600x760.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b44282-f064-478e-84b4-0c44664c1630_1600x760.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b44282-f064-478e-84b4-0c44664c1630_1600x760.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b44282-f064-478e-84b4-0c44664c1630_1600x760.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b44282-f064-478e-84b4-0c44664c1630_1600x760.png" width="1456" height="692" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/16b44282-f064-478e-84b4-0c44664c1630_1600x760.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:692,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Grid of thread blocks (figure from Nvidia CUDA C++ Programming Guide)&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="Grid of thread blocks (figure from Nvidia CUDA C++ Programming Guide)" title="Grid of thread blocks (figure from Nvidia CUDA C++ Programming Guide)" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b44282-f064-478e-84b4-0c44664c1630_1600x760.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b44282-f064-478e-84b4-0c44664c1630_1600x760.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b44282-f064-478e-84b4-0c44664c1630_1600x760.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b44282-f064-478e-84b4-0c44664c1630_1600x760.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Figure 4: Grid of thread blocks (figure from Nvidia CUDA C++ Programming Guide)</figcaption></figure></div><p>As far as implementation goes, writing a kernel requires two parts.

of this article is not teaching CUDA, we will not be going any deeper in this code. Now, let’s look at the exact steps behind the execution of a kernel on the GPU.</p></blockquote><p><span>Before the kernel can be scheduled for execution, all the data that it needs has to be copied from the memory of the host (the CPU) onto the global memory of the GPU (the device). Although, in latest GPU hardware one can also read directly from host memory using unified virtual memory (see section 2.2 of the paper: “</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06890.pdf" rel="">EMOGI: Efficient Memory-access for Out-of-memory Graph-traversal in GPUs</a><span>”).&nbsp;</span></p><p>After the GPU has all the necessary data in its memory, it assigns the thread blocks to the SMs. All threads within a block are processed by the same SM at the same time. To make this happen, the GPU must set aside resources on the SM for those threads before it can start executing them. In practice, multiple thread blocks can be assigned to the same SM for simultaneous execution.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0417e64e-77a6-443f-b861-5f2640291187_1041x331.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0417e64e-77a6-443f-b861-5f2640291187_1041x331.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0417e64e-77a6-443f-b861-5f2640291187_1041x331.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0417e64e-77a6-443f-b861-5f2640291187_1041x331.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0417e64e-77a6-443f-b861-5f2640291187_1041x331.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0417e64e-77a6-443f-b861-5f2640291187_1041x331.png" width="1041" height="331" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0417e64e-77a6-443f-b861-5f2640291187_1041x331.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:331,&quot;width&quot;:1041,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Assignment of a thread block to an SM&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="Assignment of a thread block to an SM" title="Assignment of a thread block to an SM" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0417e64e-77a6-443f-b861-5f2640291187_1041x331.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0417e64e-77a6-443f-b861-5f2640291187_1041x331.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0417e64e-77a6-443f-b861-5f2640291187_1041x331.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0417e64e-77a6-443f-b861-5f2640291187_1041x331.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Figure 7: Assignment of a thread block to an SM</figcaption></figure></div><p>As there are a limited number of SMs and large kernels can have a very large number of blocks, not all the blocks may get assigned for execution immediately. The GPU maintains a list of blocks which are waitlisted for assignment and execution. As and when any block finishes execution, the GPU assigns one of the waitlisted blocks for execution.</p><p><span>We know that all threads of a block are assigned to the same SM. But there’s another level of division of threads after this. These threads are further grouped into sizes of 32 (called a </span><em>warp</em><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-137892185" href="https://blog.codingconfessions.com/p/gpu-computing#footnote-2-137892185" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span>), and assigned together for execution on a set of cores called a processing block.</span></p><p>The SM executes all the threads within a warp together by fetching and issuing the same instruction to all of them. These threads then execute that instruction simultaneously, but on different parts of the data. In our vector addition example, all the threads in a warp might be executing the add instruction, but they would be operating on different indices of the vectors.</p><p><span>This execution model of the warp is also called </span><em>single instruction multiple threads</em><span> (SIMT) because multiple threads are executing the same instruction. It is similar to the </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data" rel="">single instruction multiple data</a></em><span> (SIMD) instructions in CPUs.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>There is an alternative instruction scheduling mechanism available in newer generations of GPUs, starting from Volta and onwards, known as </span><em>independent thread scheduling</em><span>. It allows full concurrency between threads, regardless of warp. It can be used to make better use of the execution resources, or as a synchronization mechanism between threads. We will not cover independent thread scheduling here, but you can read about it in the </span><a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#simt-architecture" rel="">CUDA programming guide</a><span>.</span></p></blockquote><p>There are some interesting details about how warps work, that are worth discussing.</p><p>Even if all the processing blocks (groups of cores) within an SM are handling warps, only a few of them are actively executing instructions at any given moment. This happens because there are a limited number of execution units available in the SM.</p><p>But some instructions take longer to complete, causing a warp to wait for the result. In such cases, the SM puts that waiting warp to sleep and starts executing another warp that doesn't need to wait for anything. This enables the GPUs to maximally utilize all the available compute and deliver high throughput.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Zero-overhead Scheduling: </strong><span>As each thread in each warp has its own set of registers, there is no overhead for the SM to switch from executing one warp to another.&nbsp;</span></p><p>This is in contrast to how context-switching between processes happens on the CPU. If a process is waiting for a long running operation, the CPU schedules another process on that core in the meanwhile. However, context switching in CPU is expensive because the CPU needs to save the registers into main memory, and restore the state of the other process.</p></blockquote><p>Finally, when all the threads of the kernel have finished executing, the final step is to copy the result back to the host memory.</p><p>Although we covered everything about a typical kernel execution but there is one more thing that requires its own section: dynamic resource partitioning.</p><p><span>We measure the utilization of the GPU resources through a metric called “</span><em>occupancy</em><span>”, which represents the ratio of the number of warps assigned to an SM to the maximum number it can support. To achieve maximum throughput, we would want to have 100% occupancy. However, in practice it is not always possible due to various constraints.&nbsp;</span></p><p>So, why can't we always reach 100% occupancy? The SM has a fixed set of execution resources, including registers, shared memory, thread block slots, and thread slots. These resources are dynamically divided among threads based on their requirements and the GPU's limits. For example, on the Nvidia H100, each SM can handle 32 blocks, 64 warps (i.e., 2048 threads), and 1024 threads per block. If we launch a grid with a block size of 1024 threads, the GPU will split the 2048 available thread slots into 2 blocks.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Dynamic vs Fixed partitioning</strong><span>: Dynamic partitioning allows for more effective usage of the computation resources in the GPU. If we compare this with a fixed partitioning scheme where each thread block receives a fixed amount of execution resources it might not always be the most efficient. In some cases the threads might be assigned more resources than they need, leading to wastage of resources and reduced throughput.</span></p></blockquote><p>Now, let's look at an example to see how resource allocation can affect the occupancy of an SM. If we use a block size of 32 threads and need a total of 2048 threads, we'll have 64 of these blocks. However, each SM can only handle 32 blocks at once. So, even though the SM can run 2048 threads, it will only be running 1024 threads at a time, resulting in a 50% occupancy rate.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, each SM has 65536 registers. To execute 2048 threads simultaneously, each thread can have a maximum of 32 registers (65536/2048 = 32). If a kernel needs 64 registers per thread, we can only run 1024 threads per SM, again resulting in 50% occupancy.</p><p>The challenge with suboptimal occupancy is that it may not provide the necessary tolerance for latency or the required compute throughput to reach the hardware’s peak performance.</p><p>Efficiently creating GPU kernels is a complex task. We must allocate resources wisely to maintain high occupancy while minimizing latency. For example, having many registers can make code run quickly but might reduce occupancy, so careful code optimization is important.</p><p>I understand that wrapping your head around so many new terms and concepts is daunting. Let’s summarize the key points for a quick review.</p><ul><li><p>A GPU consists of several streaming multiprocessors (SM), where each SM has several processing cores.</p></li><li><p>There is an off chip global memory, which is a HBM or DRAM. It is far from the SMs on the chip and has high latency.</p></li><li><p>There is an off chip L2 cache and an on chip L1 cache. These L1 and L2 caches operate similarly to how L1/L2 caches operate in CPUs.</p></li><li><p>There is a small amount of configurable shared memory on each SM. This is shared between the cores. Typically, threads within a thread block load a piece of data into the shared memory and then reuse it instead of loading it again from global memory.</p></li><li><p>Each SM has a large number of registers, which are partitioned between threads depending on their requirement. The Nvidia H100 has 65,536 registers per SM.</p></li><li><p>To execute a kernel on the GPU, we launch a grid of threads. A grid consists of one or more thread blocks and each thread block consists of one or more threads.</p></li><li><p>The GPU assigns one or more blocks for execution on an SM depending on resource availability. All threads of one block are assigned and executed on the same SM. This is for leveraging data locality and for synchronization between threads.</p></li><li><p>The threads assigned to an SM are further grouped into sizes of 32, which is called a warp. All the threads within a warp execute the same instruction at the same time, but on different parts of the data (SIMT). (Although newer generations of GPUs also support independent thread scheduling.)</p></li><li><p>The GPU performs dynamic resource partitioning between the threads based on each threads requirements and the limits of the SM. The programmer needs to carefully optimize code to ensure the highest level of SM occupancy during execution.</p></li></ul><p><span>GPUs are in pervasive use today, but their architecture and execution model is fundamentally very different from CPUs.

				<p>Kubernetes seems like the obvious choice for building out remote, standardized and automated development environments. We thought so too and have spent six years invested in making the most popular cloud development environment platform at internet scale. That’s 1.5 million users, where we regularly see thousands of development environments per day. <strong>In that time we’ve found that Kubernetes is not the right choice for building development environments.</strong></p>
<p>This is our journey of experiments, failures and dead-ends building development environments on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a>. Over the years, we experimented with many ideas involving SSDs, PVCs, <a href="https://ebpf.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">eBPF</a>, <a href="https://brauner.github.io/2020/07/23/seccomp-notify.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seccomp notify</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc.8.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TC</a> and <a href="https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">io_uring</a>, <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/718639/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shiftfs</a>, FUSE and <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/idmappings.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">idmapped mounts</a>, ranging from <a href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">microVMs</a>, <a href="https://kubevirt.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">kubevirt</a> to <a href="https://www.vcluster.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vCluster</a>.</p>
<p>In pursuit of the most optimal infrastructure to balance security, performance and interoperability. All while wrestling with the unique challenges of building a system to scale up, remain secure as it’s handling arbitrary code execution, and be stable enough for developers to work in.</p>
<p><strong>This is not a story of whether or not to use Kubernetes for production workloads</strong> that’s a whole separate conversation. As is the topic of how to build a comprehensive soup-to-nuts developer experience for shipping applications on Kubernetes.</p>
<p><strong>This is the story of how (not) to build development environments in the cloud.</strong></p>
<h2 id="why-are-development-environments-unique">Why are development environments unique?<a href="#why-are-development-environments-unique"></a></h2>
<p>Before we dive in, it’s crucial to understand what makes development environments unique compared to production workloads:</p>
<ul><li><strong>They are extremely stateful and interactive</strong>: Which means they cannot be moved from one node to another. The many gigabytes of source code, build caches, Docker container and test data are subject to a high change rate and costly to migrate. Unlike many production services, there’s a 1-to-1 interaction between the developer and their environment.</li>
<li><strong>Developers are deeply invested in their source code and the changes they make</strong>: Developers don’t take kindly to losing any source code changes or to being blocked by any system. This makes development environments particularly intolerant to failure.</li>
<li><strong>They have unpredictable resource usage patterns</strong>: Development Environments have particular and unpredictable resource usage patterns. They won’t need much CPU bandwidth most of the time, but will require several cores within a few 100ms. Anything slower than that manifests as unacceptable latency and unresponsiveness.</li>
<li><strong>They require far-reaching permissions and capabilities</strong>: Unlike production workloads, development environments often need root access and the ability to download and install packages. What constitutes a security concern for production workloads, is expected behavior of development environments: getting root access, extended network capabilities and control over the system (e.g. mounting additional filesystems).</li></ul>
<p>These characteristics set development environments apart from typical application workloads and significantly influence the infrastructure decisions we’ve made along the way.</p>
<h2 id="the-system-today-obviously-its-kubernetes">The system today: obviously it’s Kubernetes<a href="#the-system-today-obviously-its-kubernetes"></a></h2>
<p>When we started Gitpod, Kubernetes seemed like the ideal choice for our infrastructure. Its promise of scalability, container orchestration, and rich ecosystem aligned perfectly with our vision for cloud development environments. However, as we scaled and our user base grew, we encountered several challenges around security and state management that pushed Kubernetes to its limits. <strong>Fundamentally, Kubernetes is built to run well controlled application workloads, not unruly development environments.</strong></p>
<p>Managing Kubernetes at scale is complex. While managed services like GKE and EKS alleviate some pain points, they come with their own set of restrictions and limitations. We found that many teams looking to operate a CDE underestimate the complexity of Kubernetes, which lead to a significant support load for our previous self-managed Gitpod offering.</p>
<h2 id="resource-management-struggles">Resource management struggles<a href="#resource-management-struggles"></a></h2>
<p>One of the most significant challenges we faced was resource management, particularly CPU and memory allocation per environment. At first glance, running multiple environments on a node seems attractive to share resources (such as CPU, memory, IO and network bandwidth) between those resources. In practice, this incurs significant noisy neighbor effects leading to a detrimental user experience.</p>
<h3 id="cpu-challenges">CPU challenges<a href="#cpu-challenges"></a></h3>
<p>CPU time seems like the simplest candidate to share between environments. Most of the time development environments don’t need much CPU, but when they do, they need it quickly. Latency becomes immediately apparent to users when their language server starts to lag or their terminal becomes choppy. This spiky nature of the CPU requirements of development environments (periods of inactivity followed by intensive builds) makes it difficult to predict when CPU time is needed.</p>
<p>For solutions, we experimented with various CFS (<a href="https://docs.kernel.org/scheduler/sched-design-CFS.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Completely Fair Scheduler</a>) based schemes, implementing a custom controller using a DaemonSet. A core challenge is that we can not predict when CPU bandwidth is needed, but only understand when it would have been needed (by observing nr_throttled of the cgroup’s cpu_stats).</p>
<p>Even when using static CPU resource limits, challenges arise, because unlike application workloads a development environment will run many processes in the same container. These processes compete for the same CPU bandwidth, which can lead to e.g. VS Code disconnects because VS Code server is starved for CPU time.</p>
<p>We have attempted to solve this problem by adjusting the process priorities of the individual processes, e.g. increasing the priority of bash or vscode-server. However, these process priorities apply to the entire process group (depending on your Kernel’s autogroup scheduling configuration), hence also to the resource hungry compilers started in a VS Code terminal. Using process priorities to counter terminal lag requires a carefully written control loop to be effective.</p>
<p>We introduced custom CFS and process priority based control loops built on cgroupv1 and moved to cgroupsv2 once they became more readily available on managed Kubernetes platforms with 1.24. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dynamic resource allocation</a> introduced with Kubernetes 1.26 means one no longer needs to deploy a DaemonSet and modify cgroups directly, possibly at the expense of the control loop speed and hence effectiveness. All the schemes outlined above rely on second-by-second readjustment of CFS limits and niceness values.</p>
<h3 id="memory-management">Memory management<a href="#memory-management"></a></h3>
<p>Memory management presented its own set of challenges. Assigning every environment a fixed amount of memory, so that under maximum occupation each environment gets their fixed share is straightforward, but very limiting. In the cloud, RAM is one of the more expensive resources, hence the desire to overbook memory.</p>
<p>Until <a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/08/09/run-nodes-with-swap-alpha/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">swap-space became available in Kubernetes 1.22</a>, memory overbooking was near impossible to do, because reclaiming memory inevitably means killing processes. With the addition of swap space the need to overbook memory has somewhat gone away, since swap works well in practice for hosting development environments.</p>
<h2 id="storage-performance-optimization">Storage performance optimization<a href="#storage-performance-optimization"></a></h2>
<p>Storage performance is important for the startup performance and experience of development environments. We have found that specifically IOPS and latency affect experience within an environment. IO bandwidth however directly impacts your workspace startup performance, specifically when creating/restoring backups or extracting large workspace images.</p>
<p><strong>We experimented with various setups to find the right balance between speed and reliability, cost and performance.</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>SSD RAID 0</strong>: This offered high IOPS and bandwidth but tied the data to a specific node. The failure of any single disk would result in complete data loss. This is how gitpod.io operates today and we have not seen such a disk failure happen yet. A simpler version of this setup is to use a single SSD attached to the node. This approach provides lower IOPS and bandwidth, and still binds the data to individual nodes.</li>
<li><strong>Block storage such as EBS volumes or Google persistent disks which are permanently attached to the nodes</strong> considerably broaden the different instances or availability zones that can be used. While still bound to a single node, and offering considerably lower throughput/bandwidth than local SSDs they are more widely available.</li>
<li><strong>Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) seem like the obvious choice when using Kubernetes</strong>. As abstraction over different storage implementations they offer a lot of flexibility, but also introduce new challenges:<ul><li>Unpredictable attachment and detachment timing, leading to unpredictable workspace startup times. Combined with increased scheduling complexity they make implementing effective scheduling strategies harder.</li>
<li>Reliability issues leading to workspace failures, particularly during startup. This was especially noticeable on Google Cloud (in 2022) and rendered our attempts to use PVCs impractical.</li>
<li>Limited number of disks that could be attached to an instance, imposing additional constraints on the scheduler and number of workspaces per node.</li>
<li>AZ locality constraints which makes balancing workspaces across AZs even harder.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Backing up and restoring local disks proved to be an expensive operation. We implemented a solution using a daemonSet that uploads and downloads uncompressed tar archives to/from S3. This approach required careful balancing of I/O, network bandwidth, and CPU usage: for example, (de)compressing archives consumes most available CPU on a node, whereas the extra traffic produced by uncompressed backups usually doesn’t consume all available network bandwidth (if the number of concurrently starting/stopping workspaces is carefully controlled).</p>
<p>IO bandwidth on the node is shared across workspaces. We found that, unless we limited the IO bandwidth available to each workspace, other workspaces might starve for IO bandwidth and cease to function. Particularly the content backup/restore produced this problem. We implemented cgroup-based <a href="https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/9440" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IO limiter</a> which imposed fixed IO bandwidth limits per environment to solve this problem.</p>
<h2 id="autoscaling-and-startup-time-optimization">Autoscaling and startup time optimization<a href="#autoscaling-and-startup-time-optimization"></a></h2>
<p>Our primary goal was to minimize startup time at all costs. Unpredictable wait times can significantly impact productivity and user satisfaction. However, this goal often conflicted with our desire to pack workspaces densely to maximize machine utilization.</p>
<p>We initially thought that running multiple workspaces on one node would help with startup times due to shared caches. However, this didn’t pan out as expected. The reality is that Kubernetes imposes a lower bound for startup time because of all the content operations that need to happen, content needs to be moved into place, which takes time.</p>
<p>Short of keeping workspaces in hot standby (which would be prohibitively expensive), we had to find other ways to optimize startup times.</p>
<h3 id="scaling-ahead-evolution-of-our-approach">Scaling ahead: evolution of our approach<a href="#scaling-ahead-evolution-of-our-approach"></a></h3>
<p><strong>To minimize startup time, we explored various approaches to scale up and ahead:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Ghost workspaces</strong>: Before cluster autoscaler plugins were available, we experimented with “ghost workspaces”. These were preemptible pods that occupied space to scale ahead. We implemented this using a custom scheduler. However, this approach proved to be slow and unreliable to replace.</li>
<li><strong>Ballast pods</strong>: An evolution of the ghost workspace concept, ballast pods filled an entire node. This resulted in less replacement cost and faster replacement times compared to ghost workspaces.</li>
<li><strong>Autoscaler plugins</strong>: In June 2022, we switched to using cluster-autoscaler plugins when they were introduced. With these plugins we no longer needed to “trick” the autoscaler, but could directly affect how scale-up happens. This marked a significant improvement in our scaling strategy.</li></ul>
<h3 id="proportional-autoscaling-for-peak-loads">Proportional autoscaling for peak loads<a href="#proportional-autoscaling-for-peak-loads"></a></h3>
<p>To handle peak loads more effectively, we implemented a proportional autoscaling system. This approach controls the rate of scale-up as a function of the rate of starting development environments. It works by launching empty pods using the pause image, allowing us to quickly increase our capacity in response to demand spikes.</p>
<h3 id="image-pull-optimization-a-tale-of-many-attempts">Image pull optimization: a tale of many attempts<a href="#image-pull-optimization-a-tale-of-many-attempts"></a></h3>
<p>Another crucial aspect of startup time optimization was improving image pull times. Workspace container images (i.e. all the tools available to a developer) can grow to more than 10 gigabytes uncompressed. Downloading and extracting this amount of data for every workspace considerably taxes a node’s resources. We explored numerous strategies to speed up image pulls:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Daemonset pre-pull</strong>: We tried pre-pulling common images using a daemonSet. However, this proved ineffective during scale-up operations because when the node came online, and workspaces were starting, the images still wouldn’t be present on the node. Also, the pre-pulls would now compete for IO and CPU bandwidth with the starting workspaces.</li>
<li><strong>Layer reuse maximization</strong>: We built our own images using a custom builder called <a href="https://github.com/gitpod-io/dazzle" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dazzle</a>, which can build layers independently. This approach aimed to maximize layer reuse. However, we found that layer reuse is very difficult to observe due to the high cardinality and amount of indirections in the <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/spec.md" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OCI manifests</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-baked images</strong>: We experimented with baking images into the node disk image. While this improved startup times, it had significant drawbacks. The images quickly became outdated, and this approach didn’t work for self-hosted installations.</li>
<li><strong>Stargazer and lazy-pulling</strong>: This method required all images to be converted, which added complexity, cost, and time to our operations. Additionally, not all registries supported this approach when we tried it in 2022.</li>
<li><strong>Registry-facade + IPFS</strong>: This solution worked well in practice, providing good performance and distribution. We gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS6aDScfVuw" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KubeCon talk about this approach in 2022</a>. However, it introduced significant complexity to our system.</li></ul>
<p>There is no one-size-fits all solution for image caching, but a set of trade-offs with respect to complexity, cost and restrictions imposed on users (images they can use). We have found that homogeneity of workspace images is the most straightforward way to optimize startup times.</p>
<h2 id="networking-complexities">Networking complexities<a href="#networking-complexities"></a></h2>
<p>Networking in Kubernetes introduced its own set of challenges, specifically:</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Development environment access control</strong>: by default the network of environments needs to be entirely isolated from one another, i.e. one environment cannot reach another. The same is true for the access of a user to the workspace. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Network Policies</a> go a long way in ensuring environments are properly disconnected from each other.</p>
<p>Initially we controlled the access to individual environment ports (such as the IDE, or services running in the workspace) using Kubernetes services, together with an ingress proxy that would forward traffic to the service, resolving it using DNS. This quickly became unreliable at scale because of the sheer number of services. Name resolution would fail, and if not careful (e.g. setting enableServiceLinks: false) one can bring entire workspaces down.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network bandwidth sharing</strong> on the node is yet another resource that needs to be shared with multiple workspaces on a single node. Some CNIs offer network shaping support (e.g. Cilium’s <a href="https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/network/kubernetes/bandwidth-manager/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bandwidth Manager</a>). This now leaves you with yet another resource to control for, and potentially share between environments.</p></li></ul>
<h2 id="security-and-isolation-balancing-flexibility-and-protection">Security and isolation: balancing flexibility and protection<a href="#security-and-isolation-balancing-flexibility-and-protection"></a></h2>
<p>One of the most significant challenges we faced in our Kubernetes-based infrastructure was providing a secure environment while giving users the flexibility they need for development. Users want the ability to install additional tools (e.g., using apt-get install), run Docker, or even set up a Kubernetes cluster within their development environment. Balancing these requirements with robust security measures proved to be a complex undertaking.</p>
<h3 id="the-naive-approach-root-access">The naive approach: root access<a href="#the-naive-approach-root-access"></a></h3>
<p>The simplest solution would be to give users root access to their containers. However, this approach quickly reveals its flaws:</p>
<ul><li>Giving users root access essentially provides them with root privileges on the node itself, granting access to the development environment platform and other development environments that are running on that node .</li>
<li>This eliminates any meaningful security boundary between users and the host system meaning developers can accidentally, or intentionally interfere and break the development environment platform itself or even access others’ development environments.</li>
<li>It also exposes the infrastructure to potential abuse and security risks. It is then also not possible to implement a true access control model and the architecture falls short of zero-trust. You cannot ensure that a given actor in the system performing an action was verifiably themselves.</li></ul>
<p>Clearly, a more sophisticated approach was needed.</p>
<h3 id="user-namespaces-a-more-nuanced-solution">User namespaces: a more nuanced solution<a href="#user-namespaces-a-more-nuanced-solution"></a></h3>
<p>To address these challenges, we turned to user namespaces, a Linux kernel feature that provides fine-grained control over the mapping of user and group IDs inside containers. This approach allows us to give users “root-like” privileges within their container without compromising the security of the host system.</p>
<p>While Kubernetes introduced support for user namespaces in version 1.25, we had already implemented our own solution starting with Kubernetes 1.22. Our implementation involved several complex components:</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Filesystem UID shift</strong>: This is necessary to ensure that files created inside the container map correctly to UIDs on the host system. We experimented with several approaches:</p>
<ul><li>We continue to use shiftfs as our primary method for filesystem UID shifting. Despite being deprecated in some contexts, shiftfs still provides the functionality we need with acceptable performance characteristics.</li>
<li>We’ve experimented with fuse-overlayfs, which provided the necessary functionality but had performance limitations.</li>
<li>While idmapped mounts offer potential benefits, we haven’t transitioned to them yet due to various compatibility and implementation considerations.</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Mounting masked proc</strong>: When a container starts, it typically wants to mount /proc. However, in our security model, /proc is sensibly masked to prevent potential security bypasses. Working around this limitation required a tricky solution:</p>
<ul><li>We construct a masked proc filesystem.</li>
<li>This masked proc is then moved into the correct mount namespace.</li>
<li>We implement this using seccomp notify, which allows us to intercept and modify certain system calls.</li></ul></li>
<li><p><strong>FUSE support</strong>: Adding FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) support, which is crucial for many development workflows, required implementing custom device policies. This involved modifying the container’s eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) device filter, a low-level programming capability that allows us to make fine-grained decisions about device access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network capabilities</strong>: As true root one holds the CAP_NET_ADMIN and CAP_NET_RAW capabilities which provide far-reaching privileges to configure networking. Container runtimes (such as Docker/runc) make extensive use of these capabilities. Granting such capabilities to the development environment container would interfere with CNI and break the security isolation.</p>
<p>To provide such capabilities we ended up creating another network namespace inside the Kubernetes container, first connected to the outside world using slirp4netns and later using a veth pair and custom and nftables rules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enabling docker</strong>: required some specific hacks for Docker itself. We register a custom <a href="https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/blob/main/components/docker-up/runc-facade/main.go" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">runc-facade</a> which modifies the OCI runtime spec produced by Docker. This lets us remove e.g. OOMScoreAdj which still isn’t allowed because that would require CAP_SYS_ADMIN on the node.</p></li></ul>
<p>Implementing this security model came with its own set of challenges:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Performance impact</strong>: Some of our solutions, particularly earlier ones like fuse-overlayfs, had noticeable performance impacts. We’ve continually worked to optimize these.</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility</strong>: Not all tools and workflows are compatible with this restricted environment. We’ve had to carefully balance security with usability.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity</strong>: The resulting system is significantly more complex than a simple containerized environment, which impacts both development and operational overhead.</li>
<li><strong>Keeping up with Kubernetes</strong>: As Kubernetes has evolved, we’ve had to adapt our custom implementations to take advantage of new features while maintaining backwards compatibility.</li></ul>
<h2 id="the-micro-vm-experiment">The micro-VM experiment<a href="#the-micro-vm-experiment"></a></h2>
<p>As we grappled with the challenges of Kubernetes, we began exploring micro-VM (uVM) technologies like <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Firecracker</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cloud Hypervisor</a>, and <a href="https://www.qemu.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">QEMU</a> as a potential middle ground. This exploration was driven by the promise of improved resource isolation, compatibility with other workloads (e.g. Kubernetes) and security, while potentially maintaining some of the benefits of containerization.</p>
<h3 id="the-promise-of-micro-vms">The promise of micro-VMs<a href="#the-promise-of-micro-vms"></a></h3>
<p>Micro-VMs offered several enticing benefits that aligned well with our goals for cloud development environments:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Enhanced resource isolation</strong>: uVMs promised better resource isolation compared to containers, albeit at the expense of overbooking capabilities. With uVMs, we would no longer have to contend with shared kernel resources, potentially leading to more predictable performance for each development environment.</li>
<li><strong>Memory snapshots and fast resume</strong>: One of the most exciting features, particularly with Firecracker using userfaultfd, was the support for memory snapshots. This technology promised near-instant full machine resume, including running processes. For developers, this could mean significantly faster environment startup times and the ability to pick up exactly where they left off.</li>
<li><strong>Improved security boundaries</strong>: uVMs offered the potential to serve as a robust security boundary, potentially eliminating the need for the complex user namespace mechanisms we had implemented in our Kubernetes setup. This could provide full compatibility with a wider range of workloads, including nested containerization (running Docker or even Kubernetes within the development environment).</li></ul>
<h3 id="challenges-with-micro-vms">Challenges with micro-VMs<a href="#challenges-with-micro-vms"></a></h3>
<p>However, our experiments with micro-VMs revealed several significant challenges:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Overhead</strong>: Even as lightweight VMs, uVMs introduced more overhead than containers. This impacted both performance and resource utilization, key considerations for a cloud development environment platform.</li>
<li><strong>Image conversion</strong>: Converting OCI (Open Container Initiative) images into uVM-consumable filesystems required custom solutions. This added complexity to our image management pipeline and potentially impacted startup times.</li>
<li><strong>Technology-specific limitations</strong>:<ul><li>Firecracker:<ul><li>Lack of GPU support, which is increasingly important for certain development workflows.</li>
<li>No virtiofs support at the time of our experiments (mid 2023), limiting our options for efficient file system sharing.</li></ul></li>
<li>Cloud hypervisor:<ul><li>Slower snapshot and restore processes due to the lack of userfaultfd support, negating one of the key advantages we hoped to gain from uVMs.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Data movement challenges</strong>: Moving data around became even more challenging with uVMs, as we now had to contend with large memory snapshots. This affected both scheduling and startup times, two critical factors for user experience in cloud development environments.</li>
<li><strong>Storage considerations</strong>: Our experiments with attaching EBS volumes to micro-VMs opened up new possibilities but also raised new questions:<ul><li>Persistent storage: Keeping workspace content on attached volumes reduced the need to pull data from S3 repeatedly, potentially improving startup times and reducing network usage.</li>
<li>Performance considerations: While sharing high-throughput volumes among workspaces showed promise for improving I/O performance, it also raised concerns about implementing effective quotas, managing latency, and ensuring scalability.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h3 id="lessons-from-the-uvm-experiment">Lessons from the uVM experiment<a href="#lessons-from-the-uvm-experiment"></a></h3>
<p>While micro-VMs didn’t ultimately become our primary infrastructure solution, the experiment provided valuable insights:</p>
<ul><li>We loved the experience of full workspace backup and runtime state suspend/resume provided for development environments.</li>
<li>We, for the first time, considered moving away from Kubernetes. The effort to integrate KVM and uVMs into pods had us explore options outside of Kubernetes.</li>
<li>We, once again, identified storage as the crucial element for providing all three: reliable startup performance, reliable workspaces (don’t lose my data) and optimal machine utilization.</li></ul>
<h2 id="kubernetes-is-immensely-challenging-as-a-development-environment-platform">Kubernetes is immensely challenging as a development environment platform<a href="#kubernetes-is-immensely-challenging-as-a-development-environment-platform"></a></h2>
<p>As I mentioned at the beginning, for development environments we need a system that respects the uniquely stateful nature of development environments. We need to give the necessary permissions for developers to be productive, whilst ensuring secure boundaries. And we need to do all of this whilst keeping operational overhead low and not compromising security.</p>
<p>Today, achieving all of the above with Kubernetes is possible—but comes at a significant cost. We learned the difference between application and system workloads the hard way.</p>
<p>Kubernetes is incredible. It’s supported by an engaged and passionate community, which builds a truly rich ecosystem. If you’re running application workloads, Kubernetes continues to be a fine choice. However <strong>for system workloads like development environments Kubernetes presents immense challenges in both security and operational overhead</strong>. Micro-VMs and clear resource budgets help, but make cost a more dominating factor.</p>
<p>So after many years of effectively reverse-engineering and forcing development environments onto the Kubernetes platform we took a step back to think about what we believe a future development architecture needs to look like. In January 2024 we set out to build it. In October, we shipped it: <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/blog/introducing-gitpod-flex" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gitpod Flex</a>.</p>
<p>More than six years of incredibly hard-won insights for running development environments securely at internet scale went into the architectural foundations.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-development-environments">The future of development environments<a href="#the-future-of-development-environments"></a></h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/blog/introducing-gitpod-flex" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gitpod Flex</a> we carried over the foundational aspects of Kubernetes such as the liberal application of control theory and the declarative APIs whilst simplifying the architecture and improving the security foundation.</p>
<p>We orchestrate development environments using a control plane heavily inspired by Kubernetes. We introduced some necessary abstraction layers that are specific to development environments and cast aside much of the infrastructure complexity that we didn’t need—all whilst <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/blog/how-we-built-it-zero-trust-architecture" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">putting zero-trust security first</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Caption:</strong> Security boundaries of Gitpod Flex.</p>
<p>This new architecture allows us to <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gitpod-supports-development-container" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">integrate devcontainer seamlessly</a>. We also unlocked the ability to <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/blog/introducing-gitpod-desktop" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">run development environments on your desktop</a>. Now that we’re no longer carrying the heavy weight of the Kubernetes platform, <strong>Gitpod Flex can be deployed self-hosted in less than three minutes</strong> and in any number of regions, giving more fine-grained control on compliance and added flexibility when modeling organizational boundaries and domains.</p>
