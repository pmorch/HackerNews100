      <p>Thanks to the 2024 Barkley Marathons, “coming down to the last minute” will never sound the same again.</p>
<p>Runners have 60 hours to complete arguably the world’s hardest footrace in Tennessee’s Frozen Head State Park. With less than two minutes to go on Friday afternoon, Jasmin Paris, legs oozing with scrapes and ponytail awry, charged to the fabled yellow gate marking the Barkley Marathons finish and promptly collapsed over it and onto the ground.</p>
<p>She stopped the clock in 59:58:21. And she became first woman to ever finish the infamously grueling race in its 38-year history.</p>

<p>It was a year of historic firsts at the Barkley Marathons. No race is more notoriously impossible to finish. Over the first 37 years, only 17 people had done so. That all changed on March 22, 2024, when an unprecedented five runners completed the race, smashing the record of three set <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/running/racing/races/2023-barkley-marathons/">last year</a>.</p>
<p>In case that’s not enough, Jared Campbell, who finished in 59:30:32, became the first individual to finish the race four times.</p>
<p>Joining the Class of 2024 Barkley Marathons finishers is Barkley “virgin” Ihor Verys of Ukraine/Canada, who completed the race first in 58:44:59. He was followed by Tennessee’s John Kelly in 59:15:39, who became just the second person after Campbell to earn a third finish. And on his third attempt, Greig Hamilton of New Zealand finished in 59:38:42.</p>
<p>Here’s how these runners survived “the race that eats its young” during 6o of the most iconic hours of ultrarunning history.</p>

<p>Paris, 40, may have found running later in life than some, but she’s made up for lost time—and redefined what’s possible. At her debut at the Barkley Marathons in 2022, <a href="https://run.outsideonline.com/people/jasmin-paris-barkley-marathons/">she completed a “Fun Run”</a> on a year there were no finishers.</p>
<p>She returned to Frozen Head last year and blew ultrarunning fans away by becoming just the second woman ever behind Sue Johnston to start a fourth loop. While she completed the lap, she did so outside of the 48-hour cutoff, ending her Barkley quest.</p>
<p>But Paris entered the 2023 event coming off of a knee injury, which both impeded her training build-up and her ability to run to her potential up and down the insanely steep grades, which go up to a dizzying 40 percent. While that slowed her down, it also stopped her from hanging with fellow participants, including her coach Damian Hall and Kelly, on the descents. All three have cited the critical role that teamwork plays over the first four loops, when runners can help each other navigate to the hidden books that serve as checkpoints, push each other through their lows, and collectively problem-solve on the fly. (It’s every runner for themselves on the fifth loop, which runners start in rotating directions.)</p>
<p>Paris, who juggles being an elite runner with being a mother of two and an animal veterinarian, was not to be stopped this year. She returned to Frozen Head armed with the experience of two “Fun Runs,” as well as a healthy body and an interminable resolve.</p>
<p>When Laz lit the cigarette marking the start at 5:17 A.M. Eastern on Wednesday morning, Paris ran at the front of the pack with the likes of Kelly, Hall, and Verys over the course of the first lap—all three finished within a minute of 8:31 elapsed. Those four continued to work together over the second loop, which took the runners the opposite direction (counterclockwise) through the night before returning to the yellow gate 19:27 into the race.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2661074"><img data-lazy-load="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" data-src="https://run-cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-4.png?width=730" alt="Barkley Marathons" width="2100" height="1400" data-srcset="https://run-cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-4.png?width=300 300w, https://run-cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-4.png?width=768 768w" src="https://run-cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-4.png?width=730"><figcaption><span>Jasmin Paris battled soaring daytime temps, dense underbrush, and sleep deprivation to become the first-ever female finisher at the Barkley Marathons.</span> (Photo: Howie Stern)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The pack splintered over the third loop, once again clockwise and into the dawn of the second day. For the second year in a row the infamously fickle weather held off—a boon navigating through the dense underbrush and thick tree cover but also a bane for Paris, who lives in Scotland and is accustomed to inclement weather. The unrelenting sun pushed temperatures up into the 80s on Wednesday and Thursday as Paris and the rest of the remaining runners also started grappling with sleep deprivation and navigating to the hidden books that serve as checkpoints along each loop.</p>
<p>Paris completed her third “Fun Run” (third loop) in 32:15:53, “smiling and looking good,” according to Dunn.</p>
<p>At 3:10 P.M. eastern on Thursday, Dunn <a href="https://twitter.com/keithdunn/status/1770890658175127847">tweeted</a> that eight runners had moved onto loop four—a race record. That bunch included Paris and Campbell, whose quest to break his own Barkley finisher record lived on. While Paris completed loop four 10 minutes back from Campbell, Campbell waited for Paris to start lap five so she could choose her direction.</p>
<p>As the hours ticked off on Friday afternoon, fans frantically refreshing X (formerly Twitter) worried that Paris might run out of time. She was spotted on Rat Jaw with just under three hours left on the clock. Based on Verys’s splits she wouldn’t make it. But Paris found a higher inner resolve and blasted the last third of the course to finish her final lap with a 13:17 split, just in the nick of time.</p>
<p>It’s a poetic ending for the 38 years we’ve all been waiting for a woman to finish this race. Chapeaux, Jasmin.</p>
<h2><b>Jared Campbell Rewrites History, Again</b></h2>
<figure id="attachment_2661075"><img data-lazy-load="" decoding="async" data-src="https://run-cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-2.png?width=730" alt="Barkley Marathons" width="2100" height="1400" data-srcset="https://run-cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-2.png?width=300 300w, https://run-cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-2.png?width=768 768w" src="https://run-cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-2.png?width=730"><figcaption><span>Jared Campbell (left) and John Kelly (right) rewrote the books with an unprecedented four and three Barkley Marathons finishes, respectively. </span> (Photo: Howie Stern)</figcaption></figure>
<p>With three finishes under his belt, it may seem like a fourth one was clandestine for Campbell, 44. But his last finish was in 2016, several lifetimes ago in ultrarunning time. But Campbell seems to have raced with the patience of a consummate veteran, biding his time behind the lead pack over the first three loops before surpassing Paris on the fourth.</p>
<p>Some years the race ends at the 48 hour mark with no runners completing a fourth loop. Not this year. At 5:14 A.M. eastern on Friday, Dunn announced that, after Sebastian Raichon began loop five with three minutes to spare, an unprecedented seven runners were on loop five. That included Verys, who set out first in 46:06:32 after 20 minutes in camp (he chose to go clockwise); Kelly (who waited for Verys to start so Verys could choose the direction of his last lap), Hall, Hamilton, Paris, Campbell, and Raichon.</p>
<p>The seven runners who moved onto lap five all completed their fourth loop in under 15 hours, from Kelly’s leading split of 14:10 to Raichon’s 14:49. Five would succeed. Raichon and Hall would eventually turn back and face Taps, played&nbsp;on a bugle trumpet like at a military funeral.</p>
<p>Campbell, meanwhile, continued his upward momentum to finish the race with just under 30 minutes to spare, cementing his spot as the runner with the most finishes ever.</p>
<p>“That new section is brutal. You’re a bad man,” Campbell said to Laz at the finish, <a href="https://x.com/keithdunn/status/1771277977260556593?s=20">according to Dunn</a>.</p>
<p>Kelly, meanwhile, is hot on his heels with his second consecutive finish and third overall in seven tries.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2661076"><img data-lazy-load="" decoding="async" data-src="https://run-cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/howie2-1.jpg?width=730" alt="Barkley Marathons" width="1126" height="785" data-srcset="https://run-cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/howie2-1.jpg?width=300 300w, https://run-cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/howie2-1.jpg?width=768 768w" src="https://run-cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/howie2-1.jpg?width=730"><figcaption><span>Ihor Verys from Ukraine/Canada was the first finisher of the 2024 Barkley Marathons in 58:4459.</span> (Photo: Howie Stern)</figcaption></figure>
<h2><b>Ihor Verys Channels Ukrainian Strength</b></h2>
<p>A Ukrainian now living in Chilliwack, British Columbia, Verys showed remarkable resolve for a Barkley “virgin” at this masochistic event that leaves runners covered in scrapes from bushwhacking through dense and prickly underbrush, sleep deprived from staying up for nearly 60 hours straight, and physically, mentally, and spiritually depleted from covering about 130 miles and more than 60,000 feet of climbing with no course markings and no GPS devices.</p>
<p>He’s the 18th unique Barkley finisher. Hamilton and Paris make numbers 19 and 20.</p>
<p>Even before Dunn <a href="https://x.com/keithdunn/status/1771285735833817456?s=20">tweeted</a> the race’s closing words, “The 2024 Barkley Marathons has ended. There are five finishers,” the Internet started speculating about what next year would have in store.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/running/racing/races/2023-barkley-marathons/">Last year</a>, Laz told <a href="https://www.trailrunnermag.com/people/news/barkley-marathons-is-underway/">Trail Runner</a> that he “made it easier to assure a finisher.” People on the ground at Frozen Head say that the course changed minimally this year simply because Laz was recovering from heart surgery.</p>
<p>He has an entirely new route planned for 2025. The entrants, meanwhile, have an entirely new understanding of what’s possible.</p>

<p>In early 1982, the Lisa software team was trying to buckle down for the big push to ship the software within the next six months.  Some of the managers decided that it would be a good idea to track the progress of each individual engineer in terms of the amount of code that they wrote from week to week.  They devised a form that each engineer was required to submit every Friday, which included a field for the number of lines of code that were written that week.</p><p>

Bill Atkinson, the author of Quickdraw and the main user interface designer, who was by far the most important Lisa implementer, thought that lines of code was a silly measure of software productivity.  He thought his goal was to write as small and fast a program as possible, and that the lines of code metric only encouraged writing sloppy, bloated, broken code.</p><p>

He recently was working on optimizing Quickdraw's region calculation machinery, and had completely rewritten the region engine using a simpler, more general algorithm which, after some tweaking, made region operations almost six times faster.  As a by-product, the rewrite also saved around 2,000 lines of code.</p><p>

He was just putting the finishing touches on the optimization when it was time to fill out the management form for the first time.  When he got to the lines of code part, he thought about it for a second, and then wrote in the number: -2000.</p><p>

I'm not sure how the managers reacted to that, but I do know that after a couple more weeks, they stopped asking Bill to fill out the form, and he gladly complied.

            <link>https://soupault.app/</link>
            <guid>39796893</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2024 02:19:13 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://soupault.app/">https://soupault.app/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39796893">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>
     Soupault (<em>soup-oh</em>) is a static website generator/framework that works with HTML element trees and can automatically manipulate them. It can be described as a robotic webmaster that can edit HTML pages according to your rules, but doesn’t get tired of editing them.
    </p>
    <p>
     You can use soupault for making blogs and other types of websites, pretty much like any other SSGs (Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, etc.). However, you can also use it as a post-processor for existing websites — a use case other tools don’t support.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soupault is highly-configurable, extensible, and designed to give you complete control over your website generation process.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you are already familiar with other static site generators, check out the <a href="https://soupault.app/tips-and-tricks/comparison/">comparison with Hugo, Zola, and Jekyll</a>. You may also want to read the <a href="https://soupault.app/tips-and-tricks/faq">FAQ</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="quick-start">
     Quick start
    </h2>
    <p>
     Soupault is very simple to <a href="https://soupault.app/install/">install</a>: if you are on Linux (x86-64), macOS, or Microsoft Windows, you can just download an executable.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you are starting a blog or an online book, you can grab a ready-to-use <a href="https://soupault.app/blueprints">blueprint</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you want to make a custom setup, read a guide to get a feel of soupault’s workflow:

    </ul>
    <h2 id="why-soupault">
     Why soupault?
    </h2>
    <p>
     Soupault is not like other static site generators — it works on the HTML element tree level. Most SSGs treat HTML as an opaque format that can be generated with templates but cannot be read or manipulated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soupault treats HTML as a first-class format and that enables many use cases and features that are impossible for other SSGs.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Store pages in any format
    </h3>
    <p>
     Soupault works with HTML element trees, so you can store your pages in any format that can be converted to HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
     You can configure HTML conversion commands for different file extensions and soupault will call them automatically when it loads your pages.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whatever formats and tools you want to use, you can easily do it. Want to use <a href="https://github.com/commonmark/cmark">cmark</a> for Markdown, <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a> for reStructuredText, and <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/">Asciidoctor</a> for AsciiDoc? That’s simple:
    </p>
    <pre tabindex="0"><code><span>[preprocessors]</span>
  <span>md </span><span>=</span> `cmark <span>--</span>unsafe <span>--</span>smart`
  <span>rst </span><span>=</span> `pandoc <span>-</span>f rst <span>-</span>t html`
  <span>adoc </span><span>=</span> `asciidoctor <span>--</span>embedded <span>-</span>o <span>-</span>`
</code></pre>
    <p>
     Or you can write HTML pages by hand if you prefer.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Bring any external tools to your workflow and remove unnecessary client-side JavaScript
    </h3>
    <p>
     A lot of time people add non-interactive client-side JavaScript to compensate for missing features in their SSGs. Soupault helps you keep your pages lighter by pre-rendering HTML with external tools at build time instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the simplest case, you can include the output of an external program in your page, in any location identifiable with a CSS selector.
    </p>
    <pre tabindex="0"><code><span>[widgets.page-generation-date]</span>
  <span>widget </span><span>=</span> <span>"exec"</span>
  <span>command </span><span>=</span> <span>"date -R"</span>
  <span>selector </span><span>=</span> <span>"datetime#generated-on"</span>
</code></pre>
    <p>
     But you can also <em>pipe</em> element content through an external program and insert the output back. Run code examples through your favorite syntax highlighter, automatically check if they compile — there are many possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is how this website highlights source code in <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tags with Andre Simon’s <a href="http://www.andre-simon.de/doku/highlight/en/highlight.php">highlight</a>:
    </p>
    <pre tabindex="0"><code><span># Runs the content of &lt;* class="language-*"&gt; elements through a syntax highlighter</span>
<span>[widgets.highlight]</span>
  <span>widget </span><span>=</span> <span>"preprocess_element"</span>
  <span>selector </span><span>=</span> '<span>*[</span>class^<span>=</span><span>"language-"</span><span>]</span>'
  <span>command </span><span>=</span> 'highlight <span>-</span>O html <span>-</span>f <span>--</span>syntax<span>=</span>$<span>(</span>echo $ATTR_CLASS | sed <span>-</span>e <span>"s/language-//"</span><span>)</span>'
</code></pre>
    <p>
     With additional scripts you can do much more, for example, <a href="https://soupault.app/tips-and-tricks/static-rendering/#mathematics">render math with KaTeX at build time</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Extract page metadata from HTML, no front matter needed
    </h3>
    <p>
     Most static site generators make you write metadata in the “front matter”, but soupault allows you to extract it right from HTML instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     You can define a mapping of CSS selectors to metadata fields. This is how you can add a list of all pages to your main page, using the first heading tag (either <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, whichever is present) of the page as its title:
    </p>
    <pre tabindex="0"><code><span>[index]</span>
  <span>index </span><span>=</span> true

<span>[index.fields]</span>
  <span>title </span><span>= {</span> selector <span>= [</span><span>"h1"</span><span>,</span> <span>"h2"</span><span>,</span> <span>"h3"</span><span>] }</span>

<span>[index.views.page-list]</span>
  <span>page </span><span>=</span> <span>"index.html"</span>
  <span>index_selector </span><span>=</span> <span>"main"</span>

  <span>index_template </span><span>=</span> '''
    <span>&lt;</span>h2<span>&gt;</span>All pages<span>&lt;/</span>h2<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;ul class</span><span>=</span><span>"page-list"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>{%</span> for e in entries <span>%}</span>
      <span>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{e.url}}"</span><span>&gt;{{</span>e.title<span>}}&lt;/</span>a<span>&gt;&lt;/</span>li<span>&gt;</span> 
    <span>{%</span> endfor <span>%}</span>
  '''
</code></pre>
    <h3>
     Take advantage of HTML as a first-class format
    </h3>
    <p>
     Soupault’s DOM manipulation is as powerful as client-side JavaScript (without interactivity, of course), but the result is a static page.
    </p>
    <p>
     With built-in features, you can automatically create <a href="https://soupault.app/reference-manual/#footnotes-widget">two-way footnotes</a>, use a <a href="https://soupault.app/reference-manual/#toc-widget">highly-configurable ToC</a>, or <a href="https://soupault.app/reference-manual/#absolute-links">add a URL prefix to every link</a>. Most importantly, those features are available regardless of the original page format: whether the HTML was hand-written or produced by a converter, they will work the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     With <a href="https://soupault.app/plugins/">Lua plugins</a> you can do much more than that. You can transform existing HTML, or create a <abbr title="Domain-Specific Language">DSL</abbr> from “fake” elements and convert them to real HTML, e.g. create a <a href="https://soupault.app/plugins/#hyperlinked-glossary">hyperlinked glossary</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     The <a href="https://soupault.app/reference-manual/#plugin-api">plugin API</a> offers many possibilities, from adding and deleting HTML elements to executing external programs, loading data from JSON/YAML/TOML, and more.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Built to last
    </h3>
    <p>
     Soupault is available as a statically-linked executable with no dependencies. You can stick with the same version for years if it works for you. Or you can download every new version, try it out, and easily revert back if you run into any issues.
    </p>
    <h2 id="name">
     Why it's named soupault?
    </h2>
    <p>
     Soupault is named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Soupault">Philippe Soupault</a>, a French dadaist and surrealist writer, because it’s based on the <a href="https://github.com/aantron/lambdasoup">lambdasoup</a> library.
    </p>
    <p>
     Its development is sponsored by the <a href="http://www.college-de-pataphysique.org/">College of ’Pataphysics</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby_horsing">International Hobby Horsing Association</a>.<a href="#footnote-sponsors"></a>
    </p>
    <h2 id="graphics">

    </h2>
    <p>
     Soupault logo is a stick horse. It’s a reference to the meeting where Philippe Soupault et al. chose a name for their movement by opening a dictionary at a random word and landed on <q>dada (n.), a colloquial for a stick horse</q>, which is why they named it “dadaism”.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure role="presentation"><figcaption><p>The government orders show an "unconstitutional" overreach by the government, multiple privacy experts said.</p><small>AFP via Getty Images</small></figcaption></figure>
<p><abbr>F</abbr>ederal investigators have ordered Google to provide information on all viewers of select YouTube videos, according to multiple court orders obtained by <em>Forbes</em>. Privacy experts from multiple civil rights groups told <em>Forbes</em> they think the orders are unconstitutional because they threaten to turn innocent YouTube viewers into criminal suspects.</p>


<p>In a just-unsealed case from Kentucky reviewed by <em>Forbes</em>, undercover cops sought to identify the individual behind the online moniker “elonmuskwhm,” who they suspect of selling bitcoin for cash, potentially running afoul of money laundering laws and rules around unlicensed money transmitting.</p>

<p>In conversations with the user in early January, undercover agents sent links of YouTube tutorials for mapping via drones and augmented reality software, then asked Google for information on who had viewed the videos, which collectively have been watched over 30,000 times.</p>

<p>The court orders show the government telling Google to provide the names, addresses, telephone numbers and user activity for all Google account users who accessed the YouTube videos between January 1 and January 8, 2023. The government also wanted the IP addresses of non-Google account owners who viewed the videos. The cops argued, “There is reason to believe that these records would be relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation, including by providing identification information about the perpetrators.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“No one should fear a knock at the door from police simply because of what the YouTube algorithm serves up.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The court granted the order and Google was told to keep the request secret until it was unsealed earlier this week, when it was obtained by <em>Forbes</em>. The court records do not show whether or not Google provided data in the case.</p>

<p>In another example, involving an investigation in New Hampshire, the Portsmouth Police received a threat from an unknown male that an explosive had been placed in a trashcan in a public area. The order says that after the police searched the area, they learned they were being watched over a YouTube live stream camera associated with a local business. Federal investigators believe similar events have happened across the U.S., where bomb threats were made and cops watched via YouTube.</p><fbs-ad position="top" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-top"></fbs-ad>
<p>They asked Google to provide a list of accounts that “viewed and/or interacted with” eight YouTube live streams and the associated identifying information during specific timeframes. That included a video posted by Boston and Maine Live, which has 130,000 subscribers. Mike McCormack, who set up the company behind the account, IP Time Lapse, said he knew about the order, adding that they related "to swatting incidents directed at the camera views at that time."</p>
<p>Again, it’s unclear whether Google provided the data.</p>
<p>"With all law enforcement demands, we have a rigorous process designed to protect the privacy and constitutional rights of our users while supporting the important work of law enforcement,” said Google spokesperson Matt Bryant. “We examine each demand for legal validity, consistent with developing case law, and we routinely push back against overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands for user data, including objecting to some demands entirely."</p>
<p>The Justice Department had not responded to requests for comment at the time of publication.</p>
<p>Privacy experts said the orders were unconstitutional because they threatened to undo protections in the 1st and 4th Amendments covering free speech and freedom from unreasonable searches. “This is the latest chapter in a disturbing trend where we see government agencies increasingly transforming search warrants into digital dragnets. It’s unconstitutional, it’s terrifying and it’s happening every day,” said Albert Fox-Cahn, executive director at the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. “No one should fear a knock at the door from police simply because of what the YouTube algorithm serves up. I’m horrified that the courts are allowing this.”</p>
<p>He said the orders were “just as chilling” as geofence warrants, where Google has been ordered to provide data on all users in the vicinity of a crime.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Large-scale quantum computers are capable of breaking all of the common forms of
asymmetric cryptography used on the Internet today. Luckily, they don’t exist
yet. The Internet-wide transition to post-quantum cryptography began in 2022
when NIST announced their final candidates for key exchange and signatures in
the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography">NIST PQC competition</a>. There is <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/">plenty</a>
<a href="https://bughunters.google.com/blog/5108747984306176/google-s-threat-model-for-post-quantum-cryptography">written</a> about the <a href="https://durumcrustulum.com/2024/02/24/how-to-hold-kems/">various algorithms</a> and
<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/pqc-dig-sig">standardization</a> <a href="https://wiki.ietf.org/group/sec/PQCAgility">processes</a> that are underway.</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom is that it will take a long time to transition to
post-quantum cryptography, so we need to start standardizing and deploying
things <em>now</em>, even though quantum computers are not actually visible on the
horizon. We’ll take the best of what comes out the NIST competitions, and deploy
it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there has not been enough discussion about how what NIST has
standardized is simply not good enough to deploy on the public web in most
cases. We need better algorithms. Specifically, we need algorithms that use less
bytes on the wire—a KEM that when embedded in a TLS ClientHello is still under
one MTU, a signature that performs on par with ECDSA that is no larger than
RSA-2048, and a sub-100 byte signature where we can optionally handle a larger
public key.</p>
<p>To understand why, we’ll look at the current state of HTTPS. Cryptography is
primarily used in five ways for HTTPS on the public web:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Symmetric Encryption/Decryption</strong>: The actual data for HTTP(2) is
transmitted as data inside a TLS connection using some authenticated cipher
(AEAD) such as AES-GCM. This is largely <a href="https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/post-quantum-age/">already secure</a>
against quantum computers.</li>
<li><strong>Key Agreement</strong>: Symmetric cryptography requires a secret key. Key agreement
is the process in which two parties mutually generate a secret key. TLS 1.3
traditionally used Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman for key agreement. All
non-post-quantum key exchange mechanisms, including Diffie-Hellman, are broken
by quantum computers.</li>
<li><strong>Server Identity</strong>: Servers are authenticated via X.509 certificates. At
minimum, a server certificate (leaf certificate) contains a public key, and a
signature from an intermediate certificate. The intermediate certificate
contains another public key, and a signature from an trusted root certificate.</li>
<li><strong>Issuance Transparency</strong>: The <a href="https://dadrian.io/blog/posts/certificates-explained">public Web PKI</a>
relies on trusted third-parties known as <em>Certification Authorities</em> to validate
domain ownership. Certificates are publicly logged, and servers attest that
their certificates are included in the logs. This provides a deterrent for
malicious certificate issuance, since any certificate that is maliciously issued
to an attacker for some site will be publicly visible, and has the potential to
be detected.  Servers achieve issuance transparency by providing at least two
<em>Signed Certificate Timestamps</em>, usually embedded in the certificate itself.</li>
<li><strong>Handshake Authentication</strong>: The identity of the server needs to be bound to
the connection itself during the TLS handshake. In TLS 1.3, this is provided
by a signature over the server key share message from the key in the server
certificate in the CertificateVerify message.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a threat from <em>future</em> quantum computers to encrypted network
connections <em>today</em> in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later">“harvest now, decrypt later”</a> attacks.
To defend against this, we only need to ensure that key agreement and symmetric
encryption are “quantum resistant” (secure in the presence of quantum
computers). Luckily, symmetric encryption is already quantum resistant, and so
defending against harvest-now-decrypt-later only requires updating the key
exchange algorithm to a post-quantum variant.</p>
<p>The remaining uses of cryptography in HTTPS—server identity, issuance
transparency, and handshake authentication—will eventually need to transition
to post-quantum variants. In the current structure of TLS, this means replacing
all signatures with post-quantum variants.  However, the need to do so, while no
less <em>important</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> than transitioning key exchange, is less <em>urgent</em>. This
matches the actions of browsers, who are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1827g86/tls_13_hybridized_kyber_support_for_firefox/">actively</a>
<a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2023/08/protecting-chrome-traffic-with-hybrid.html">deploying</a> post-quantum key exchange algorithms. An X25519 key
exchange involves the client and server transmitted 32 bytes each. The NIST
winner for key agreement, <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/ipd">ML-KEM (Kyber)</a>, involves the client sending
1,184 bytes and the server sending 1,088 bytes.</p>
<p>However, no widely-used browser has started
deploying post-quantum signatures.</p>
<p>This is because post-quantum signatures and their corresponding public keys are
too damn big. There are 5 signatures and 2 public keys transmitted during an
average TLS handshake for HTTPS:</p>
<ul>
<li>The leaf certificate has 1 signing public key of the site, and 1 signature
from the intermediate certificate.</li>
<li>The intermediate certificate has 1 signing public key, used to the validate
the signature on the leaf, and 1 signature from the key on the root
certificate, which is used to validate the authenticity of the intermediate
certificate. The root certificate and its embedded public key are
predistributed to clients.</li>
<li>The handshake itself is has 1 signature from the private key corresponding to
the public key in the leaf certificate.</li>
<li>Each Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT) contains one signature. The public key used
to the validate the signature is predistributed to clients. Most certificates
have 2 SCTs and therefore 2 additional signatures.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current breakdown of key and signature sizes in TLS is roughly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Root certificates often contain RSA keys, as do intermediate certificates.
Root certificates are predistributed, and intermediates are provided by the
server, alongside the leaft certificate. An RSA intermediate certificate has a
4096-bit (512 byte) signature, and a 2048-bit (256 byte) public key.</li>
<li>An ECDSA leaf certificate has a 32-byte key and a 256-byte RSA signature from
the intermediate.</li>
<li>The handshake contains a 64-byte ECDSA signature.</li>
<li>Each SCT contains a 64-byte ECDSA signature.</li>
</ul>
<p>In total, this is 512 + 256 + 256 + 32 + 64 + 2*64 = 1,248 bytes of signatures
and public keys in a normal TLS handshake for HTTPS. Of the winning signature
algorithms from the first NIST PQC competition, <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/ipd">ML-DSA (Dilithium)</a> is
the only signature algorithm that could be used in the context of TLS and it has
1,312-byte public keys and 2,420-byte signatures. This means <em>a single ML-DSA
public key is bigger than all of the 5 signatures and 2 public keys currently
transmitted during an HTTPS connection</em>. In a direct “copy-and-replace” of
current signature algorithms with ML-DSA, a TLS handshake would contain 5*2420
+ 2*1312 = 14,724 bytes of signatures and public keys, an over 10x increase.</p>
<p>Barring a large-scale quantum computer staring us in the face, this is not a
tenable amount of data to send simply to <em>open</em> a connection. As a baseline
reality check, we should not be sending over 1% of a 3.5" floppy disk purely in
signatures and public keys.</p>
<p>In more concrete terms, for the server-sent messages, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/">Cloudflare
found</a> that every 1K of additional data added to the server response
caused median HTTPS handshake latency increase by around 1.5%. For the
ClientHello, Chrome saw a 4% increase in TLS handshake latency when they
deployed ML-KEM, which takes up approximate 1K of additional space in the
ClientHello. This pushed the size of the ClientHello greater than the standard
maximum transmission unit (MTU) of packets on the Internet, ~1400 bytes, causing
the ClientHello to be fragmented over two underlying transport layer (TCP or
UDP) packets<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Assuming ML-KEM is here to stay, this means if we want to keep the total
latency impact of post-quantum cryptography under 10%<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, we need to make all
of the authentication happen in under ~4K of additional bytes in the server
reponse messages. Unfortunately, a <em>single</em> ML-DSA signature/public key pair is
~4K bytes. ML-DSA is too big to deploy to mitigate a threat that does not yet
have a timeline to exist.</p>
<p>There is some good news on the horizon. NIST recognized that the signatures were
quite large, and is running a <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/pqc-dig-sig">follow-on competition</a> for
smaller, faster signatures. Unfortunately, the <a href="https://pqshield.github.io/nist-sigs-zoo/">leaders</a> in that
competition are not quite there yet, but some do have potential:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar (UOV)</strong>: UOV has big public keys (66K!), but
signatures are 94 bytes, which is on par with the current 64 bytes from an
ECDSA signature in an SCT. The 66K public key size is acceptable because the
public keys for Certificate Transparency logs are predistributed, and there’s
only a small number of logs (~10). UOV is not a solution for root
certificates—there’s too many root certificates and root stores would be too
big to embed in a binary.</li>
<li><strong>SQISign</strong>: SQISign has 64-byte keys and 177-byte signatures. If used for
certificates and the handshake signature, it would be 2*64 + 3*177 = 659
bytes. This is compared to the current RSA+ECDSA approach, which is 4096/8 +
2048/8 + 2048/8 + 32 + 64 = 1,120 bytes. SQISign is a net win (and comparable
to an ECDSA-only chain)! Unforunately, SQISign is incredibly slow. For SQISign
to be feasible, it needs around a 10,000x performance improvement in signing
speed, and a 100x performance improvement in verification.</li>
<li><strong>Mayo</strong>: Mayo is possibly feasible. Mayo1 has 1,168-byte public keys and
321-byte signatures, which makes it a candidate for use in certificates and
for handshake authentication (1168*2 + 321*3 = 3,299 bytes). Mayo2 has 5,488-byte keys, but only 180-byte signatures, which makes it a candidate for SCTs if UOV doesn’t pan out.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a couple other performance knobs we can attempt to tweak, but they all
require larger changes to how HTTPS, TLS, and the Web PKI interact than doing a
straight “copy-and-replace” with PQC algorithms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intermediate elision</strong>: Predistributing known intermediate certificates to
browsers would save ~1.5K bytes for the median intermediate certificate. This
doesn’t fundamentally change any of the feasibility of the NIST candidates, but
it likely helps Mayo stay within bounds of what’s currently feasible.</li>
<li><strong>Merging SCTs and Certificates</strong>: Experimental proposals such as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-davidben-tls-merkle-tree-certs/">Merkle-Tree
Certificates</a> merge the certificate and SCTs into a single object
with a single hash-based proof of authenticity. This would reduce the
handshake to only require a single handshake signature and a single public key
in the merkle-tree certificate, alongside a hash-based inclusion proof.
Unfortunately, it makes some tradeoffs that are likely not feasible for
non-browser applications, such as requiring delayed (hourly) batch issuance,
and requiring clients to be up to date relative to a transparency server.
Solutions in this form may be a performance optimization for browser clients,
but are likely not feasible for non-browser clients. That being said,
handshake latency matters considerably less for non-browser clients.</li>
<li><strong>Shrink the size of the root store</strong>: A post-quantum root store with less
than 10 certificates containing UOV public keys would be within an order of
magnitude of the size of current root stores.</li>
</ul>
<p>All together, this means that combining Mayo and UOV with other changes to the
PKI <em>may</em> be enough to transition to quantum-resistant authentication in the
WebPKI. Unfortunately, all of this armchair design remains subject to several risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The performance impact might actually be larger than what Cloudflare measured.
Cloudflare’s experiment likely was primarily ideal clients (enterprise users
on desktop) accessing a login page (served by a low-RTT edge server).</li>
<li>The security of Mayo and UOV might not hold. This would not be the first time
a promising post-quantum algorithm <a href="https://securitycryptographywhatever.com/2022/08/11/hot-cryptanalytic-summer-with-steven-galbraith/">turns out to be broken</a>.</li>
<li>10% might be too much of a performance hit unless quantum computers are
immenient.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what can we do to derisk all this? Well, for any solution, we need to get
better a trust anchor agility, intermediate suppresion, and PKI migrations. This
is <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-davidben-tls-trust-expr/">happening already</a>.</p>
<p>The best thing we could do to make the post-quantum transition more feasible is
to come up with better algorithms that have performance characteristics no worse
than RSA-2048. Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>A post-quantum KEM that fits in a single MTU when combined with the rest of
the TLS ClientHello</li>
<li>A 10,000x signing speed improvement and 100x verification speed improvement
in SQISign (or a new, equivalent algorithm with these characteristics)</li>
</ol>
<p>To some extent, this may be yelling for the impossible. Unfortunately, using
ML-DSA for the Web PKI in its current form is also impossible.</p>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>A case could be made that the entire quantum threat is not important, but
I’m not here to argue that today. However important the quantum threat is, key
exchange and authentication are just as important—both get broken by the
same large-scale quantum computer. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The same concern applies to the server messages, but since certificates
are already 1.5-2K, we already have a multi-packet reponse size that varies
server to server, so the impact of additional bytes is not directly aligned
with a drastic relative increase in fragmentation. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The 10% threshold is somewhat arbitrary and we have some wiggle room. In
reality, it’s very hard to justify nearly any performance hit that is big
enough to impact actual page load metrics or “Core Web Vitals”, such as First
Contentful Paint and Largest Contentful Paint until the threat has much more
clear and present danger. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content">

<p>Though&nbsp;adults tend to look back on youth as a time of innocence, childhood is actually terrifying. Kids are always privy to more of the world’s horrors than we realize, and those glimpses of war on the evening news or the mutilation on display in anti-drunk-driving&nbsp;films leave permanent scars on their&nbsp;permeable little minds.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I often couldn’t distinguish between what was real and what had been a vivid nightmare.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Richard Littler had a frightening&nbsp;childhood, too, but as a designer and screenwriter, he turned his memories of life in suburban Britain during the 1970s into a haunting and hilarious&nbsp;<a href="http://scarfolk.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0091958482/?tag=colleweekl-20" target="_blank">book</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;the fictional dystopian town of Scarfolk. Littler mined the dark side of his childhood to create pamphlets, posters, book covers, album art, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/scarfolk-council" target="_blank">audio clips</a>, and television shorts—remnants of life in a paranoid, totalitarian 1970s community, where even babies are not to be trusted.</p>
<p>What started as a handful of faux-vintage images for friends’ birthday cards grew into this&nbsp;universe of fake memorabilia, so complete&nbsp;that the Scarfolk concept&nbsp;was recently optioned for a British TV series.&nbsp;Littler borrows liberally from authentic designs of the era to craft his artfully decaying images, which are so familiar at first glance that many have been mistaken for authentic found objects rather than re-creations.</p>
<p>We recently spoke&nbsp;with&nbsp;Littler about the real-world inspiration for Scarfolk and what we&nbsp;can learn from its language of fear.</p>
<div id="attachment_67384"><p><a href="https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/03/18104530/Scarfolktourism1.jpg"><img src="https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/03/18104530/Scarfolktourism1-1024x687.jpg" alt="Top, the cover of a mock-Penguin book on children and hallucinogens.

Above: A page from an outdated Scarfolk tourism brochure.</p></div>
<h4>Collectors Weekly: Where did the concept of Scarfolk come from?</h4>
<p><em>Richard Littler</em>: I initially started Scarfolk because I wanted to capture, or rather investigate, the fading memories of my 1970s and early ’80s British childhood. I suffered from night terrors as a kid, and looking back, I often couldn’t distinguish between what was real and what had been a vivid nightmare.</p>
<p>One such memory was of children playing school sports on a railway line: As the children entered a dark tunnel, they’re injured or killed by speeding trains while a brass band played on the embankment. It almost sounds like the plot of a Bunuel film, and for many years I was convinced I had imagined it, especially because everyone I mentioned it to looked at me as if I were insane.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I finally discovered that I hadn’t imagined it—it’s a 1977 public information film called “The Finishing Line,” which was made to deter children from playing near railway lines. The film was screened&nbsp;at my junior school, or around second or third grade in the U.S., where pupils were also shown slide presentations of burn victims to discourage playing with fireworks. “The Finishing Line” caused controversy at the time and was eventually withdrawn. However, its replacement was another violent public information film about a boy called Robbie who loses both legs in a railway accident.</p>
<div id="attachment_67421"><p><a href="https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/03/21113818/kids-books.jpg"><img src="https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/03/21113818/kids-books.jpg" alt="Two Scarfolk books aimed at children." width="650" height="469"></a></p><p>Two Scarfolk books aimed at children.</p></div>
<p>In terms of external inspirations, Scarfolk has all sorts of influences, including Monty Python and Terry Gilliam in particular, George Orwell’s and Yevgeny Zamyatin’s dystopias, the political cartoonists Gerald Scarfe and Ralph Steadman, music by Boards of Canada and&nbsp;The Beatles (whose work from 1967 on I consider “proto-hauntology”), and even the surreal song introductions during live Peter-Gabriel-era Genesis shows.</p>
<p>The conceit is that Scarfolk can never leave the 1970s, even though the rest of the world passes by normally. Perhaps this happens in a neighboring parallel universe, who knows. In practical terms, it&nbsp;means the present day can occasionally leak into the 1970s and vice versa, which is a way to contrast changes in social attitudes and ideas of the past 40 or 50 years.</p>
<h4>Collectors Weekly: Do you think of&nbsp;Scarfolk as an alternate version of your childhood?</h4>
<p><em>Littler</em>: Scarfolk is more like a&nbsp;half memory. This means popular or stereotypical imagery from the period is ignored—there are no lava lamps, discos, or garish fashion and interior design. Scarfolk often invokes involuntary memories of long-since forgotten things, which didn’t have a life outside of the period or were taken for granted, like municipal designs, household products, TV station idents, and library music.</p>
<p>The vaguer the memory the better, because it produces this dim&nbsp;sense of recognition, and as you&nbsp;try to piece together the fragments, Scarfolk offers a substitute history. These substitutions are fictional, of course, and sometimes absurdly dark and dystopian.</p>

<h4>Collectors Weekly: Were&nbsp;the ’70s really so&nbsp;dystopian?</h4>
<div id="attachment_67423"><p><a href="https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/03/21114015/letsmakebombs.jpg"><img src="https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/03/21114015/letsmakebombs.jpg" alt="Scarfolk graphics, like the above book cover, push actual issues toward laughable conclusions." width="225" height="338"></a></p><p>Scarfolk graphics, like the above book cover, push actual issues toward laughable conclusions.</p></div>
<p><em>Littler</em>: I don’t know how much of my memories are colored by hindsight, but it certainly seems dark in retrospect. Sometimes it was quite literally dark, as well: I grew up during a time of industrial unrest when the country was subject to power cuts and rationing. There were frequent reports of riots and IRA terrorism in the U.K., some of them relatively close to home. I think that such random events undermine one’s sense of security.</p>
<p>This lack of control also affected another area of culture, the preoccupation with the supernatural and occult. Books about UFOs, ghosts, telekinesis, and witchcraft filled the shelves. There wasn’t any skepticism as far I could tell. It was all delivered as fact; perhaps it was a more gullible time. It was as if the fabric of reality was unstable and a poltergeist or UFO could appear at any time.</p>
<p>The term most often applied to Scarfolk is hauntology, which I hadn’t heard of before I started Scarfolk. Hauntology plays in part with the idea developed by Jacques Derrida (via Karl Marx) of the specter of communism haunting Europe after its demise, but it has become something a bit different in popular culture. It recycles aesthetic forms and reflects the clash between the dreams we had of the future in the 1960s through the 1980s versus where we actually are now. But it also looks back, as did 1970s culture, to earlier periods, like pre-Christian paganism and <a href="https://www.collectorsweekly.com/victorian-era/overview">Victoriana</a>, for example.</p>

<h4>Collectors Weekly: As a designer, what do you like most about the period’s&nbsp;aesthetic?</h4>
<p><em>Littler</em>: I like the clean lines and simple typefaces of modernism, and I’ve come to appreciate the aesthetic of Brutalist architecture. But it’s not just the period design I’m drawn to—I’m also interested in the pre-digital age and the idea that everything from that period is physically decaying.</p>
<p>Digital images don’t fade after being left on a window sill for a few years; they don’t crack or crumble. An image that goes viral on the Internet, for example, is identical no matter how many copies there are of it. In the pre-digital age, two people may have owned the same book or LP, but there would be idiosyncratic differences between the two physical objects.&nbsp;I have a personal response to most of the artifacts I imitate, and I’m lucky that others have had similar responses.</p>

<h4>Collectors Weekly: What’s your typical method for creating Scarfolk graphics?</h4>
<p><em>Littler</em>: I have a couple approaches. The first is to scour the Internet or my own books for an image that appeals to me and then improvise an idea around it. I collect digital imagery of the period for reference—my folder of 1970s images has about 20,000 items in it. In terms of physical objects, I don’t actively collect anything, though&nbsp;I own many publications from the period, particularly comics and books.</p>
<p>The second method is to start with an idea, and then go hunting for the appropriate imagery. This is a much harder process, but it’s necessary for posts that are direct comments on contemporary events and recent news.</p>
<div id="attachment_67406"><p><a href="https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/03/18151122/real-pelican-covers.jpg"><img src="https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/03/18151122/real-pelican-covers-1024x558.jpg" alt="Scarfolk designs often play with the modernist aesthetic of actual Penguin covers, like these three above." width="650" height="354"></a></p><p>Scarfolk designs often play with the modernist aesthetic of actual Penguin covers, like these three above.</p></div>
<h4>Collectors Weekly: Have people mistaken your designs for real artifacts?</h4>
<p><em>Littler</em>: I’ve had mails from people telling me they contacted Penguin, the publisher, to ask where they might buy copies of some of the fake Scarfolk books, like “<a href="http://scarfolk.blogspot.de/2013/02/children-hallucinogens.html" target="_blank">Children and Hallucinogens</a>.” And there are often cases when people believe a Scarfolk post to be genuine, particularly those posts which elicit knee-jerk emotional reactions. Usually these deal with social issues like race, gender, or the treatment of children, and they haven’t taken in enough of the image to realize that it’s parody or satire. Most Scarfolk readers are very playful and like to string people along for as long as they can get away with it.</p>
<p>I have a soft spot for “Children &amp; Hallucinogens” and “<a href="http://scarfolk.blogspot.de/2013/05/the-dont-campaign-and-kak-1973.html" target="_blank">Don’t</a>”&nbsp;because they propelled Scarfolk when I first started the blog, and to date they’re two of the most frequently viewed images. In general, I prefer designs that&nbsp;imitate recognizable period branding, like the Ladybird or Penguin book covers.</p>
<div id="attachment_67412"><p><img src="https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/03/18151738/book-cover-double.jpg" alt="Two of the unsettling &quot;How To&quot; books made for Scarfolk. " width="650" height="517"></p><p>Two of the unsettling “How To” books made for Scarfolk.</p></div>
<h4>Collectors Weekly: How does Scarfolk reflect contemporary culture?</h4>
<p><em>Littler</em>: Scarfolk is paranoid and cynical, and often touches on themes such as surveillance and the diminishment of civil rights. To a certain extent, Scarfolk is speculative because it plays with the recent&nbsp;political developments and either subverts them or exaggerates them to the point of absurdity, though that’s becoming difficult with people like Donald Trump and the incumbent British government. Increasingly, there are official actions and statements that come across like they’ve already been created by satirists. It’s becoming hard for us to outdo our sources!</p>

            <pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 23:14:43 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://nfraprado.net/post/vcard-rss-as-an-alternative-to-social-media.html">https://nfraprado.net/post/vcard-rss-as-an-alternative-to-social-media.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39795830">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Last year after talking for a while with someone during a conference they asked
me for my LinkedIn to be able to connect with me, to which I answered I didn't
have one.</p>
<p>It was many years ago when I decided to leave social media. I don't miss it.
Instant messaging allows me to keep in touch with the people that really matter
to me in a much more personal way.</p>
<p>Still, this interaction stayed in the back of my mind. It would indeed be nice
to keep track of these connections too. The people you had an interesting
conversation with for just a few minutes. To be able to check how they're doing
every now and then, who they're working for and what they're hacking on.</p>
<p>Essentially I would like for everyone to have an online profile and feed, which
I could easily check and subscribe to, and that this subscription data could be
stored locally. Why should that be exclusive to social media?</p>
<p>It's not. In fact, the feed part has already been solved for quite a long time
with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard)">Atom</a>. So by just having the URL for someone's RSS/Atom feed, you can
add it to your feed reader and easily follow the person's updates wherever
they're published to.</p>
<p>The profile part, a place with the key points about a person's current status
(name, photo, location, employer, etc), is the one that has historically been
tied to social media. Personal websites do many times have an "about" page with
such information, but I find the lack of structure makes it way less useful than
a social media's profile.</p>
<p>However, there's actually a widely used open standard for encoding profiles as
well: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard">vCard</a>. It's mainly known as the format used on email clients to store
contacts, where they're even synchronized between server and clients using the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CardDAV">CardDAV</a> protocol. But vCards are also used for contacts in your phone: it's
possible to import and export contacts on iOS and Android using vCards.</p>
<p>So that's when I realized, if there's a widely used open standard for feeds, and
another for profiles, why not join the two? By embedding an RSS/Atom feed URL in
a vCard, it becomes a single file that has all the information needed to
identify a person and follow their updates. Since it's a single file, it's easy
to share it with others as well as store the vCards for all your connections
locally.</p>
<p>Now one interesting bit is that though the profile information on the vCard
might get outdated, there is actually a <code>SOURCE</code> property which is meant to
contain the URL where the latest version of the vCard can be retrieved. So by
hosting your vCard in a public URL, say your personal website, it's possible for
people that have already downloaded it to keep it up to date.</p>
<p>As for how the feed URL can be encoded in the vCard, after skimming over
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6350">the latest version of the spec</a>, I originally intended to have it as a plain
<code>URL</code> property. But I wanted the main URL in the vCard to still be the
person's website, so some mechanism would be needed to differentiate between the
two URLs. At first I thought of using a <code>MEDIATYPE</code> parameter in the <code>URL</code>,
but the spec explicitly said that for protocols such as HTTP the
<code>Content-type</code> HTML header should be used instead. However, as it seems,
despite RSS/Atom feeds having standardized media types (<code>application/rss+xml</code>
and <code>application/atom+xml</code> respectively), in practice, <code>text/xml</code> is used
instead. In the end, this means that in order to tell that an URL in the vCard
is for an RSS/Atom feed, the URL would need to be fetched and read. To avoid
that complication, I decided, reluctantly, to use a non-standard property
instead, <code>X-FEED</code>, for the feed.</p>
<div id="trying-it-out">
<h2>Trying it out</h2>
<p>In order to try the idea out, I created <a href="https://codeberg.org/nfraprado/vcard-network">this repository</a> with a couple simple
scripts. First there's a <code>vcard-render</code> script that parses vCards and renders
them using a provided <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinja_(template_engine)">jinja</a> template. The idea is that you can use it to render
your vCard and your connections' vCards in your website for example, which is
exactly what I use it for <a href="https://nfraprado.net/pages/vcard-network.html">in this page I've added to the website</a> (it can be
found from the About page). If you're curious as to how I integrated the script
into my website, see <a href="https://codeberg.org/nfraprado/blog/commit/148c9cf31eb10434ba127e94332e51397f18db99">this commit</a>.</p>
<p>The other script is <code>vcard-to-opml</code> which extracts the RSS feed from the
vCards supplied and generates an OPML file with them, which can then be imported
into a feed reader. The idea here is to run this script on the vCards of all the
people you have downloaded (your connections) so you can easily follow their
feeds. I use <a href="https://newsboat.org/">newsboat</a> as my feed reader, so I would add the following command
to a crontab to run it periodically (as soon as I get some real connections!):</p>
<pre>newsboat -i &lt;(awk 1 ~/ark/etc/dav/contacts/5DEB-65D21680-2F1-4AEA3480/* | ./vcard-to-opml.py)
</pre>
<p>Note: <code>awk</code> is used here instead of a simple <code>cat</code> because apparently those
vCards don't have a newline at the end of the file. I'm not sure if it's my
email provider's fault, where I store my vCards, or <a href="http://vdirsyncer.pimutils.org/en/stable/">vdirsyncer</a>'s fault, which
is the program I use to have a local copy of my vCards.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you're interested in trying out using vCards and RSS to connect to people as
well, check out the <a href="https://codeberg.org/nfraprado/vcard-network">repository</a> that contains those scripts. And feel free to
reach out if you do so, you can find my email on... you guessed it, my vCard 😉.</p>
<p>Even if no one ever uses this, at least I now have a proper answer for the next
person that asks for my LinkedIn. "Just scan this QR code and you'll see my
profile" 🙂.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					
	<article id="post-601798">

<p>The majority of the EU Parliament’s lead committees today approved far-reaching new <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/plmrep/COMMITTEES/CJ12/AG/2024/03-19/1297044EN.pdf">anti-money laundering laws</a>: Anonymous cash payments over €3,000 will be banned in commercial transactions. Cash payments over €10,000 will even be completely banned in business transactions. And anonymous payments in cryptocurrencies to wallets operated by providers (hosted wallets) will be prohibited even for minimum amounts without a threshold.</p>



<p>MEP and digital freedom fighter Dr. Patrick Breyer (Pirate Party) explains his vote against as follows:</p>



<p>“Generally prohibiting anonymous payments would at best have minimal effects on crime, but it would deprive innocent citizens of their financial freedom. The medicines or sex toys I buy is nobody’s business. To collect donations, dissidents such as the late Alexei Navalny and his wife are increasingly reliant on anonymous donations in virtual currencies worldwide. Wikileaks has also already been cut off from donations by credit card companies. Where every financial transaction is captured and saved forever, this creates a honey pot for malicious hackers and law enforcement as well as a chilling government shadow over every purchase or donation.</p>



<p>This EU war on cash will have nasty repercussions! For thousands of years, societies around the world have lived with privacy-protecting cash. With the creeping abolition of cash, there is a threat of negative interest rates and the risk of banks cutting off the money supply at any time. Dependence on banks is increasing at an alarming rate. This kind of financial disenfranchisement must be stopped.</p>



<p>Instead, we need to think about ways we can bring the best attributes of cash into our digital future. We have a right to pay and donate online without our personal transactions being recorded. If the EU believes it can regulate virtual currencies at a regional level, it hasn’t understood the global nature of the Internet.”</p>



<p>Background on the cash limit:</p>



<p>There was a great public outcry when the Commission asked the public for their opinion on limiting cash payments in 2017. More than 90% of responding citizens spoke out against such a step. Respondents considered paying anonymously in cash an “essential personal freedom” and that “Restrictions on payments in cash are ineffective in achieving the potential objectives (fight against criminal activities, terrorism, tax evasion)”. According to an ECB survey up to 10% of citizens use cash even for amounts greater than 10.000 € (e.g. buying cars). According to calculations by shadow economy expert Friedrich Schneider of the University of Linz, banning large cash payments would have “only minimal lowering effects on crime”.</p>



<p>Background on “virtual cash”:</p>



<p>Unlike cash, which is entirely anonymous, transactions carried out with cryptocurrencies can, in the case of Bitcoin, be traced on the “blockchain”. Law enforcement has again and again been successfully prosecuting such criminals by detecting unusual patterns and identifying suspects. Some criminals have eventually de-anonymized themselves, and every criminal will need to eventually exchange their digital funds for real money. Virtual Assets are of minor relevance to the global financial system. There is insufficient evidence on the volume and frequency of the usage of cryptocurrencies for money laundering. EU rules would be easy to circumvent due to the global nature of the Internet. Virtual Assets can technically be transferred directly from one person to another without using intermediaries, which makes them impossible to regulate. Where Virtual Assets have been used for criminal activities in the past, prosecution has been possible on the basis of the current rules.</p>

            <link>https://pack.ac/note/pack</link>
            <guid>39793805</guid>
            <pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 19:11:45 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://pack.ac/note/pack">https://pack.ac/note/pack</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39793805">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Pack is a container format that can support files and raw data, and it is made to be safe, fast, and reliable for years to come.</p>
        <p>It is designed to be the most efficient way to pack any amount of data and improve the user experience to fit the future. The author proposes a fresh solution based on well-formed standards to significantly improve performance while improving features like random access, update, security, and user experience.</p>
        <p>It is free to use, and the source code is available with a permissive license, ensuring freedom from patent concerns.</p>
        <div><p>You can get the latest version from <a href="https://pack.ac/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://pack.ac/</a> .</p></div>
        <h2>Reason</h2>
        <p>It's been decades since any new proper work was done for a container format, and the author felt that there was a need for a new design considering new generations of hardware and advancements in algorithms.</p>
        <p>Most popular solutions like Zip, gzip, tar, RAR, or 7-Zip are near or more than three decades old. While holding value for such a long time (in the computer world) is testimony to their greatness, the work is far from done.</p>
        <p>To demonstrate that, here are some numbers comparing the output size and speed as CompressedSpeed.</p>
        <div><pre><p>Packing a copy of a folder containing more than 81K files and around 1.25 GB on a test machine:</p><code>ZIP:     253 MB,  146 s      = 1
tar.gz:  214 MB,  28.5 s     ====== 6
tar:    1345 MB,  4.7 s      ====== 6
RAR:     235 MB,  27.5 s     ====== 6
7z:      135 MB,  54.2 s     ===== 5
Pack:    194 MB,  1.3 s      ================================================================================================================================================= 145</code></pre></div>
        <p>Unpack speed, random access, memory use, and other factors are also improved similarly.</p>
        <p>Pack is smart and configures itself as needed; there are not many dials to play with.</p>
        <p>Beside numbers, the Pack format is based on the universal and arguably one of the most safe and stable file formats, SQLite3, and compression is based on Zstandard, the leading standard algorithm in the field. These design choices promise reliable storage, transactional updates, exceptional speed, low resource usage, smartness, and simplicity.</p>
        <h2>Future</h2>
        <p>In the near future, stabilizing will be the most important task. Locking and encryption, graphical interface, OS integration, and development tools and libraries are planned and under development. Builds for many more platforms will be available over time.</p>
        <p>For the time being, you are encouraged to try Pack for yourself and share results and notes with others, including author by emailing, o at pack.ac.</p>
        <p>If you want to know more about design, plans, and other notes, you can check out <a href="https://pack.ac/notes">Notes</a>.</p>
        <p>You can find the source code for a deeper study at <a href="https://pack.ac/source">Source</a>.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The field of data compression has been well-lit with great work in the past decades, and Pack tries to continue this path as the next step and proposes the next universal choice in the field.</p>
        <p>The author is aware of unfathomable speedups and design decisions. Readers are welcome to test, read the code, and engage in discussions.</p>
        <p>Everyone is encouraged to use Pack to have a more efficient solution and build on it for an improved future.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>The nonprofit organization that supports the <strong>Firefox</strong> web browser said today it is winding down its new partnership with <strong>Onerep</strong>, an identity protection service recently bundled with Firefox that offers to remove users from hundreds of people-search sites. The move comes just days after a report by KrebsOnSecurity forced Onerep’s CEO to admit that he has founded dozens of people-search networks over the years.</p>
<div id="attachment_66872"><p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mozillamonitor.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-66872" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mozillamonitor.png" alt="" width="749" height="379" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mozillamonitor.png 1185w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mozillamonitor-768x389.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mozillamonitor-782x396.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-66872">Mozilla Monitor. Image Mozilla Monitor Plus video on Youtube.</p></div>
<p><strong>Mozilla</strong> only began bundling Onerep in Firefox last month, when it announced the reputation service would be offered on a subscription basis as part of <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/terms/subscription-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mozilla Monitor Plus</a>. Launched in 2018 under the name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_Monitor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox Monitor</a>, Mozilla Monitor also checks data from the website <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Have I Been Pwned?</a> to let users know when their email addresses or password are leaked in data breaches.</p>
<p>On March 14, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/ceo-of-data-privacy-company-onerep-com-founded-dozens-of-people-search-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a story</a> showing that Onerep’s Belarusian CEO and founder <strong>Dimitiri Shelest</strong> launched dozens of people-search services since 2010, including a still-active data broker called <strong>Nuwber</strong> that sells background reports on people. Onerep and Shelest did not respond to requests for comment on that story.</p>
<p>But on March 21, Shelest released a lengthy statement wherein he admitted to maintaining an ownership stake in Nuwber, a consumer data broker he founded in 2015 — around the same time he launched Onerep.</p>
<p>Shelest maintained that Nuwber has “zero cross-over or information-sharing with Onerep,” and said any other old domains that may be found and associated with his name are no longer being operated by him.</p>
<p>“I get it,” Shelest wrote. “My affiliation with a people search business may look odd from the outside. In truth, if I hadn’t taken that initial path with a deep dive into how people search sites work, Onerep wouldn’t have the best tech and team in the space. Still, I now appreciate that we did not make this more clear in the past and I’m aiming to do better in the future.” The full statement is available&nbsp;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dimitri-Shelest-Letter-_-Comment-on-Krebs-article-3.20.24-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>&nbsp;(PDF).</p>
<div id="attachment_66783"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-66783" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/onerep-shellest.png" alt="" width="749" height="439" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/onerep-shellest.png 1275w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/onerep-shellest-768x450.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/onerep-shellest-782x458.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-66783">Onerep CEO and founder Dimitri Shelest.</p></div>
<p>In a statement released today, a spokesperson for Mozilla said it was moving away from Onerep as a service provider in its Monitor Plus product.</p>
<p>“Though customer data was never at risk, the outside financial interests and activities of Onerep’s CEO do not align with our values,” Mozilla wrote. “We’re working now to solidify a transition plan that will provide customers with a seamless experience and will continue to put their interests first.”<span id="more-66866"></span></p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity also reported that Shelest’s email address was used circa 2010 by an affiliate of <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=spamit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spamit</a>, a Russian-language organization that paid people to aggressively promote websites hawking male enhancement drugs and generic pharmaceuticals. As noted in the March 14 story, this connection was confirmed by research from multiple graduate students at my alma mater George Mason University.</p>
<p>Shelest denied ever being associated with Spamit. “Between 2010 and 2014, we put up some web pages and optimize them — a widely used SEO practice — and then ran AdSense banners on them,” Shelest said, presumably referring to the dozens of people-search domains KrebsOnSecurity found were connected to his email addresses (dmitrcox@gmail.com and dmitrcox2@gmail.com). “As we progressed and learned more, we saw that a lot of the inquiries coming in were for people.”</p>
<p>Shelest also acknowledged that Onerep pays to run ads on “on a handful of data broker sites in very specific circumstances.”</p>
<p>“Our ad is served once someone has manually completed an opt-out form on their own,” Shelest wrote. “The goal is to let them know that if they were exposed on that site, there may be others, and bring awareness to there being a more automated opt-out option, such as Onerep.”</p>
<p>Reached via Twitter/X, HaveIBeenPwned founder <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Troy Hunt</a> said he knew Mozilla was considering a partnership with Onerep, but that he was previously unaware of the Onerep CEO’s many conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>“I knew Mozilla had this in the works and we’d casually discussed it when talking about Firefox monitor,” Hunt told KrebsOnSecurity. “The point I made to them was the same as I’ve made to various companies wanting to put data broker removal ads on HIBP: removing your data from legally operating services has minimal impact, and you can’t remove it from the outright illegal ones who are doing the genuine damage.”</p>
<p>Playing both sides — creating and spreading the same digital disease that your medicine is designed to treat — may be highly unethical and wrong. But in the United States it’s not against the law. Nor is collecting and selling data on Americans. Privacy experts say the problem is that data brokers, people-search services like Nuwber and Onerep, and online reputation management firms exist because virtually all U.S. states exempt so-called “public” or “government” records from consumer privacy laws.</p>
<p>Those include voting registries, property filings, marriage certificates, motor vehicle records, criminal records, court documents, death records, professional licenses, and bankruptcy filings. Data brokers also can enrich consumer records with additional information, by adding social media data and known associates.</p>

          <p>
          In the grand compendium of universal knowledge, it is universally
          acknowledged that the scribbles of a wizard not only transcend the
          mundane but are, without a shadow of a doubt, the most exhilarating
          form of notation known to humanoid kind. For who could resist the
          allure of a well-placed spell in the margins?
          </p>
          
        </blockquote>
        <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
        <p>
          magick.css is a minimalistic, (mostly) classless CSS framework that
          is designed to be easy to use and easy to understand. It is contained
          in a single file, and every choice is commented. The goal is to
          achieve an elegant, but magically playful look, while maximizing
          readability and the ability to convey information; <em>somewhat akin
            to the notes of a wizard</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The framework retains its beauty and functionality across <strong>all
            devices</strong> and screen sizes, and works entirely
          <strong>without JavaScript</strong>. It is inspired by <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/" target="_blank">LaTeX</a>,
          old school TTRPG rulebooks, CSS frameworks like <a href="https://concrete.style/" target="_blank">concrete.css</a> and
          <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/" target="_blank">Tufte CSS</a> and the "usability as design" ethic of
          brutalism.

      <section id="howto">
        <h2>How to use magick.css</h2>
        
        <p>
          The easiest way to check out magick.css for your own project is to add it from
          a CDN. Just add these two lines to your html <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>:
        </p>
        <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/normalize.css"&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/magick.css"&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>
          You could also just download the magick.css file from this repo, and include
          it into your html <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> as you normally would:
        </p>
        <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/magick.css"&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>
          You could also add magick.css to your JS project like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>npm install normalize.css magick.css</code></pre>
        <p>
          And import them in your code:
        </p>
        <pre><code>import 'normalize.css'
import 'magick.css'</code></pre>
        <p>
          For anything beyond that: magick.css should work with any HTML5
          document, as it is 99% classless. There are some cool features that
          you can use, though; just scroll down to discover them!
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="layout">
        <h2>Layout</h2>
        <p>
          To have your page structured as a responsive, readable column, wrap
          all of your content in <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tags, and then use
          <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags to break up long form content
          content into sections. This page is a good example of how to do this.
        </p><p>
          (You could of course just ignore this advice and use magick.css for
          typography and styled components only.)
        </p>
        <p>Here is a simple example of the usual structure:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
      &lt;header&gt; &lt;/header&gt;
      &lt;section&gt; &lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;section&gt; &lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;section&gt; &lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;footer&gt; &lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>
          To add tangential information, magick.css uses the
          <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tag. You will find it used from time to
          time on this page. Should you want to elaborate on a point, or provide
          additional context, you can use magick.css's sidenotes.<span></span>
          <span>Sidenotes are automagically numbered!</span>
          You can find out more about this in the <a href="#extras">Extras</a>
          section below.

      <section id="typography">
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>
          Here is a showcase of the typography that magick.css offers:
        </p>
        <br>
        <div>
          <p>
            <h2>Heading 1: A title bold and grand, the story's gate.</h2>
            <h2>Heading 2: A subtitle beneath, where chapters await.</h2>
            <h3>Heading 3: With secrets whispered, plots thicken here.</h3>
            <h4>Heading 4: Fine details shared, the message stands clear.</h4>
          </p>
          <div>
            <p>Paragraphs flow, a river of text,</p>
            <p><a href="#">Links like portals, where will we go next?</a></p>
            <p><strong>Strong as stone, our words firmly stand,</strong></p>
            <p><em>Emphasized whispers, softly they land.</em></p>
            <p><u>Underlined secrets, subtly hinted,</u></p>
            <p><small>Small, yet mighty, our words are minted.</small></p>
            <p><code>Code speaks in logic, crisp and neat,</code></p>
            <p>Typography's spell, now complete.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          Headings below <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> are not styled by magick.css;
          they are usually not needed for hierarchical structuring, but instead
          for very specific use cases. So should you need them, you can style
          them as you see fit.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            [It is] notable that the Feynman lectures [...] write
            about all of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of
            hierarchical headings: chapters and A-level heads in the text.
          </p>
          
        </blockquote>
      </section>

      <section id="structured-content">
        <h2>Structured Content</h2>
        <h3>Lists</h3>
        <p>
          Lists are kept simple, as to not distract from the content:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>This is...</li>
          <li>... an unordered list.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>This is...</li>
          <li>... an ordered list.</li>
        </ol>

        <dl>
          <dt>And this weird fellow here...</dt>
          <dd>... is a description list.</dd>
        </dl>
        <br>
        <h3>Tables</h3>
        <p>
          In a similar manner to lists, tables are clear and concise,
          directing reader focus to the data at hand:
        </p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Potion</th>
              <th>Main Ingredient</th>
              <th>Catalyst</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Glow Dew</td>
              <td>Bioluminescent algae (81mg)</td>
              <td>🜼</td>
            </tr>

      <section id="forms-and-input">
        <h2>Forms &amp; Input</h2>
        Interactive elements can be used on their own, or as part of a form.
        Keep reading to see examples of both.
        <h3>Buttons</h3>
        
        

        <h3>Text Inputs</h3>
        <p>
          Free standing text inputs are not opinionated in regards to their size
          or placement, as their use can vary greatly. Here are some examples:
        </p>
        
        
        

        <h3>Checkboxes &amp; Radio Buttons</h3>
        <p>
          Labels for checkboxes and radio buttons are expected <em>after</em>
          the input element. This way, magick.css can ensure proper grouped
          spacing between them, without requiring additional wrappers and classes.
        </p>
        
        <label for="checkbox1">I am a checkbox.</label>
        
        <label for="checkbox2">I am disabled.</label>
        <br>
        
        <label for="radio1">I am a radio button.</label>
        
        <label for="radio2">I am disabled.</label>
        
        

        <h3>Forms</h3>
        <p>
          Forms provide a structured context for interactive elements. In
          magick.css, forms are styled to stand out, grabbing the user's
          attention. To stay within the established design, this is achieved by
          giving forms a handwritten, paper note feel:
        </p>
        
      </section>

      <section id="media-and-figures">
        <h2>Media &amp; Figures</h2>
        <p>
          Media elements such as images and video can stand alone or be
          presented as a figure, giving structure and elegance to your content,
          and an opportunity to add context using a caption.
        </p>
        <h3>Standalone</h3>
        
        <p>
          Let's start with a standalone <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element.
          It will not be stretched or distorted, but will be displayed at its
          natural size; as long as enough space is available:
        </p>
        <img loading="lazy" src="https://picsum.photos/640/480?grayscale&amp;random=1" alt="an example, depicting a random subject">
        <h3>In a Figure</h3>
        <p>
          Using a <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element, we can display the media
          element more prominently, and can also add a caption using a <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> tag:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img loading="lazy" src="https://picsum.photos/640/480?grayscale&amp;random=2" alt="an example, depicting a random subject">
          <figcaption>This is the figure caption, is usually provides context.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </section>

      <section id="code-quotes-and-preformatting">
        <h2>Code, Quotes and Preformatting</h2>
        <h3>Code</h3>
        <p>
          Displaying code can be done either inline or in a distinct block. To
          inline code, use the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag. For larger pieces of
          code, use <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> to wrap the
          <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag. By the way, you can also use figures to
          display code snippets!
        </p>
        <figure>
          <pre><span><span>1</span><span>2</span><span>3</span><span>4</span><span>5</span><span>6</span><span>7</span><span>8</span><span>9</span></span><code>void fib(int x) {
    unsigned long a = 0, b = 1, c;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; x; i++) {
        printf("%lu ", a);
        c = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = c;
    }
}</code></pre>
          <fibcaption>This C function generates numbers of the fibonacci sequence.</fibcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          (Line numbering of code requires some extra preprocessing of the
          content, but it is quite simple to do, even just by hand. Find out
          how in the <a href="#extras">Extras</a> section.)
        </p>

        <h3>Quotes</h3>
        <p>
          For quotes, use the <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> tag. Depending on
          the content, you might want to use preformatted text or let the
          browser handle the formatting:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.
          </p>
          
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Adding a citation is done using a <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> inside
          the blockquote. Just look at the source code of this page to see how
          it's done!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's now consider a poem, where the formatting is imporant and can't be
          dynamically determined by the browser. In this case, we wrap the poem
          contents in a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre><p>The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
   Went envying her and me— 
Yes!— that was the reason (as all men know,
   In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of a cloud, chilling
   And killing my Annabel Lee.</p></pre>
          
        </blockquote>

So why can't we build web apps in Python?</p><p>Before working on Reflex, I worked on AI projects at a startup and then at a big tech company. On these teams, we used Python for everything from data analysis to machine learning to backend services. But when it came to building user interfaces or apps so that others could use our work, there wasn't a good option to stay in Python. Suddenly, we had to switch to JavaScript and learn a whole new ecosystem.</p><p>Making a UI should be simple, but even though we had great engineers on our team, the overhead of learning a new language and tools was a huge barrier. Often making a UI was harder than the actual work we were doing!</p><p>There were a few ways already to build apps in Python, but none of them fit our needs.</p><p>On the one hand, there are frameworks like <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">   <!-- -->Django<!-- --> </a> and <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">   <!-- -->Flask<!-- --> </a> that are great for building production-grade web apps. But they only handle the backend - you still need to use JavaScript and a frontend framework, as well as writing a lot of boilerplate code to connect the frontend and backend.</p><p>On the other hand, pure Python libraries like <a href="https://dash.plotly.com/">   <!-- -->Dash<!-- --> </a> and <a href="https://streamlit.io/">   <!-- -->Streamlit<!-- --> </a> can be great for small projects, but they are limited to a specific use case and don't have the features and performance to build a full web app. As your app grows in features and complexity, you may find yourself hitting the limits of the framework, at which point you either have to limit your idea to fit the framework, or scrap your project and rebuild it using a "real web framework".</p><p>We wanted to bridge this gap by creating a framework that is easy and intuitive to get started with, while remaining flexible and powerful to support any app.</p><p>   <!-- -->
<li>   <strong>Pure Python</strong>: Use one language for everything.<!-- --> </li>
<li>   <strong>Easy to get started</strong>: Build your ideas easily without needing web development experience.<!-- --> </li>
<li>   <strong>Full flexibility</strong>: Web apps should match the customizability and performance of traditional web frameworks.<!-- --> </li>
<li>   <strong>Batteries included</strong>: Handle the full-stack from the frontend, to the backend, to deployment.<!-- --> </li>
<!-- --> </p><p>Now let's dive into how we built Reflex to meet these goals.</p><p>Full-stack web apps are made up of a frontend and a backend. The frontend is the user interface, and is served as a web page that runs on the user's browser. The backend handles the logic and state management (such as databases and APIs), and is run on a server.</p><p>In traditional web development, these are usually two separate apps, and are often written in different frameworks or languages. For example, you may combine a Flask backend with a React frontend. With this approach, you have to maintain two separate apps and end up writing a lot of boilerplate code to connect the frontend and backend.</p><p>We wanted to simplify this process in Reflex by defining both the frontend and backend in a single codebase, while using Python for everything. Developers should only worry about their app's logic and not about the low-level implementation details.</p><p>Under the hood, Reflex apps compile down to a <a href="https://react.dev/">   <!-- -->React<!-- --> </a> frontend app and a <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi">   <!-- -->FastAPI<!-- --> </a> backend app. Only the UI is compiled to Javascript; all the app logic and state management stays in Python and is run on the server. Reflex uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">   <!-- -->WebSockets<!-- --> </a> to send events from the frontend to the backend, and to send state updates from the backend to the frontend.</p><p>The diagram below provides a detailed overview of how a Reflex app works. We'll go through each part in more detail in the following sections.</p><div aria-owns="rmiz-modal-" data-rmiz=""><p><img src="https://reflex.dev/architecture.png"></p></div><p>We wanted Reflex apps to look and feel like a traditional web app to the end user, while still being easy to build and maintain for the developer. To do this, we built on top of mature and popular web technologies.</p><p>When you <code>reflex run</code> your app, Reflex compiles the frontend down to a single-page <a href="https://nextjs.org/">   <!-- -->Next.js<!-- --> </a> app and serves it on a port (by default <code>3000</code>) that you can access in your browser.</p><p>The frontend's job is to reflect the app's state, and send events to the backend when the user interacts with the UI. No actual logic is run on the frontend.</p><p>Reflex frontends are built using components that can be composed together to create complex UIs. Instead of using a templating language that mixes HTML and Python, we just use Python functions to define the UI.</p><pre><div><pre><code>def index():
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.link(
            rx.avatar(src=GithubState.profile_image),
            href=GithubState.url,
        ),
        rx.input(
            placeholder="Your Github username",
            on_blur=GithubState.set_profile,
        ),
    )

</code></pre></div></pre><p>In our example app, we have components such as <code>rx.hstack</code>, <code>rx.avatar</code>, and <code>rx.input</code>. These components can have different <strong>props</strong> that affect their appearance and functionality - for example the <code>rx.input</code> component has a <code>placeholder</code> prop to display the default text.</p><p>We can make our components respond to user interactions with events such as <code>on_blur</code>, which we will discuss more below.</p><p>Under the hood, these components compile down to React components. For example, the above code compiles down to the following React code:</p><pre><div><pre><code>&lt;HStack&gt;
    &lt;Link href={GithubState.url}&gt;
        &lt;Avatar src={GithubState.profile_image}/&gt;
    &lt;/Link&gt;
    &lt;Input
        placeholder="Your Github username"
        // This would actually be a websocket call to the backend.
        onBlur={GithubState.set_profile}
    &gt;
&lt;/HStack&gt;
</code></pre></div></pre><p>Many of our core components are based on <a href="https://radix-ui.com/">   <!-- -->Radix<!-- --> </a>, a popular React component library. We also have many other components for graphing, datatables, and more.</p><p>We chose React because it is a popular library with a huge ecosystem. Our goal isn't to recreate the web ecosystem, but to make it accessible to Python developers.</p><p>This also lets our users bring their own components if we don't have a component they need. Users can <a href="https://reflex.dev/docs/wrapping-react/overview/">   <!-- -->wrap their own React components<!-- --> </a> and then <a href="https://reflex.dev/docs/custom-components/overview/">   <!-- -->publish them<!-- --> </a> for others to use. Over time we will build out our <a href="https://reflex.dev/docs/custom-components">   <!-- -->third party component ecosystem<!-- --> </a> so that users can easily find and use components that others have built.</p><p>We wanted to make sure Reflex apps look good out of the box, while still giving developers full control over the appearance of their app.</p><p>We have a core <a href="https://reflex.dev/docs/styling/theming/">   <!-- -->theming system<!-- --> </a> that lets you set high level styling options such as dark mode and accent color throughout your app to give it a unified look and feel.</p><p>Beyond this, Reflex components can be styled using the full power of CSS. We leverage the <a href="https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction">   <!-- -->Emotion<!-- --> </a> library to allow "CSS-in-Python" styling, so you can pass any CSS prop as a keyword argument to a component. This includes <a href="https://reflex.dev/docs/styling/responsive/">   <!-- -->responsive props<!-- --> </a> by passing a list of values.</p><p>Now let's look at how we added interactivity to our apps.</p><p>In Reflex only the frontend compiles to Javascript and runs on the user's browser, while all the state and logic stays in Python and is run on the server. When you <code>reflex run</code>, we start a FastAPI server (by default on port <code>8000</code>) that the frontend connects to through a websocket.</p><p>All the state and logic are defined within a <code>State</code> class.</p><pre><div><pre><code>class GithubState(rx.State):
    url: str = "https://github.com/reflex-dev"
    profile_image: str = (
        "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104714959"
    )

    def set_profile(self, username: str):
        if username == "":
            return
        github_data = requests.get(
            f"https://api.github.com/users/{username}"
        ).json()
        self.url = github_data["url"]
        self.profile_image = github_data["avatar_url"]

</code></pre></div></pre><p>The state is made up of <strong>vars</strong> and <strong>event handlers</strong>.</p><p>Vars are any values in your app that can change over time. They are defined as class attributes on your <code>State</code> class, and may be any Python type that can be serialized to JSON. In our example, <code>url</code> and <code>profile_image</code> are vars.</p><p>Event handlers are methods in your <code>State</code> class that are called when the user interacts with the UI. They are the only way that we can modify the vars in Reflex, and can be called in response to user actions, such as clicking a button or typing in a text box. In our example, <code>set_profile</code> is an event handler that updates the <code>url</code> and <code>profile_image</code> vars.</p><p>Since event handlers are run on the backend, you can use any Python library within them. In our example, we use the <code>requests</code> library to make an API call to Github to get the user's profile image.</p><p>Now we get into the interesting part - how we handle events and state updates.</p><p>Normally when writing web apps, you have to write a lot of boilerplate code to connect the frontend and backend. With Reflex, you don't have to worry about that - we handle the communication between the frontend and backend for you. Developers just have to write their event handler logic, and when the vars are updated the UI is automatically updated.</p><p>You can refer to the diagram above for a visual representation of the process. Let's walk through it with our Github profile image example.</p><p>The user can interact with the UI in many ways, such as clicking a button, typing in a text box, or hovering over an element. In Reflex, we call these <strong>event triggers</strong>.</p><pre><div><pre><code>rx.input(
    placeholder="Your Github username",
    on_blur=GithubState.set_profile,
)

</code></pre></div></pre><p>In our example we bind the <code>on_blur</code> event trigger to the <code>set_profile</code> event handler. This means that when the user types in the input field and then clicks away, the <code>set_profile</code> event handler is called.</p><p>On the frontend, we maintain an event queue of all pending events. An event consists of three major pieces of data:</p><p>   <!-- -->
<li>   <strong>client token</strong>: Each client (browser tab) has a unique token to identify it. This let's the backend know which state to update.<!-- --> </li>
<li>   <strong>event handler</strong>: The event handler to run on the state.<!-- --> </li>
<li>   <strong>arguments</strong>: The arguments to pass to the event handler.<!-- --> </li>
<!-- --> </p><p>Let's assume I type my username "picklelo" into the input. In this example, our event would look something like this:</p><pre><div><pre><code>{
    client_token: "abc123",
    event_handler: "GithubState.set_profile",
    arguments: ["picklelo"]
}
</code></pre></div></pre><p>On the frontend, we maintain an event queue of all pending events.</p><p>When an event is triggered, it is added to the queue. We have a <code>processing</code> flag to make sure only one event is processed at a time. This ensures that the state is always consistent and there aren't any race conditions with two event handlers modifying the state at the same time.</p><div data-accent-color="violet"><p>There are exceptions to this, such as <a href="https://reflex.dev/docs/events/background-events/">   <!-- -->background events<!-- --> </a> which allow you to run events in the background without blocking the UI.</p></div><p>Once the event is ready to be processed, it is sent to the backend through a WebSocket connection.</p><p>Once the event is received, it is processed on the backend.</p><p>Reflex uses a <strong>state manager</strong> which maintains a mapping between client tokens and their state. By default, the state manager is just an in-memory dictionary, but it can be extended to use a database or cache. In production we use Redis as our state manager.</p><p>Once we have the user's state, the next step is to run the event handler with the arguments.</p><pre><div><pre><code>def set_profile(self, username: str):
    if username == "":
        return
    github_data = requests.get(
        f"https://api.github.com/users/{username}"
    ).json()
    self.url = github_data["url"]
    self.profile_image = github_data["avatar_url"]

</code></pre></div></pre><p>In our example, the <code>set_profile</code> event handler is run on the user's state. This makes an API call to Github to get the user's profile image, and then updates the state's <code>url</code> and <code>profile_image</code> vars.</p><p>Every time an event handler returns (or <a href="https://reflex.dev/docs/events/yield-events/">   <!-- -->yields<!-- --> </a>), we save the state in the state manager and send the <strong>state updates</strong> to the frontend to update the UI.</p><p>To maintain performance as your state grows, internally Reflex keeps track of vars that were updated during the event handler (<strong>dirty vars</strong>). When the event handler is done processing, we find all the dirty vars and create a state update to send to the frontend.</p><p>In our case, the state update may look something like this:</p><pre><div><pre><code>{
    "url": "https://github.com/picklelo",
    "profile_image": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104714959" 
}
</code></pre></div></pre><p>We store the new state in our state manager, and then send the state update to the frontend. The frontend then updates the UI to reflect the new state. In our example, the new Github profile image is displayed.</p><p>I hope this provides a good overview of how Reflex works under the hood. We will have more posts coming out to share how we made Reflex scalable and performant through features such as state sharding and compiler optimizations.</p><p>As always you can follow us for more:</p><p>   <!-- -->

<p>Written by Ethan Messeri</p>



<p>Inflation has been in the news a lot lately. Recently, it has always been in the context that inflation is too high. From eggs to rent prices, everything is going up, and whenever someone talks about inflation, lower is always better. However, as many know, the Federal Reserve, the central bank for the United States, has had a de facto target rate of inflation at 2% and an official target rate ever since 2012. So why does the Fed want some level of inflation? Why should the target not be 0%? After all, no one likes it when prices rise, so why not 1%? Why not negative inflation or deflation? Is there a reason for 2%?</p>



<p>The story of the 2% inflation target starts oddly in New Zealand. In 1989, New Zealand wanted to codify the independence of its central bank, and in this bill, it directed the New Zealand finance minister and head of its central bank to come up with an inflation target (Irwin 2014). If this target was not met, then the head of the central bank could be fired. According to David Caygill, New Zealand’s finance minister at the time, “Inflation targeting wasn’t from our point of view the main point of the act,” and establishing the bank’s independence from political processes was far more important (Irwin, 2014). There were some concerns that a target would lead to higher employment, but the main opposition to the inflation target was in the hospital at the time. Once the bill became law, then an inflation target had to be chosen. In an off-hand remark in an interview, the former head central banker said the inflation target should be zero to 1 percent. However, Don Brash, the head of the central bank, claimed “It was almost a chance remark,” and “The figure was plucked out of the air to influence the public’s expectations ”(Irwin, 2014). They used this number as a starting point and pushed it up to 2% to give themselves a bit more room.</p>



<p>One could easily believe that an arbitrary number based on lack of political opposition and an off-hand comment by a central banker would not have much effect, but that assumption would be wrong. Once the central bank said that inflation would be 2%, everyone else assumed that it would be too, since the central bank could use monetary policy to change the inflation rate. For example, contracts assumed a 2% inflation rate, which means wages would only rise 2% a year. This meant that costs only would have to rise 2%, meaning that inflation slowed. It also got rid of the inflationary cycle where one buys goods now since they now believe they will be much more expensive later, creating a shortage of goods and an increase in prices. In 1989, the inflation rate was 7.6% in New Zealand, and by 1991 it was 2%. Countries started to take notice, and Canada and Britain implemented inflation targets shortly after (Irwin,2014).</p>



<p>​​</p>



<p>The United States was having a debate about the inflation rate the Fed should target, at the same time. Paul Volcker, who was Fed chair from 1979 to 1987, and his succeeding Fed Chair, Alan Greenspan, who served during this time period and until 2006, favored an inflation rate that was 0% to 1% (Sommer, 2023). They argued that this target was minimal enough to not affect business decisions, and prices would stay stable. However, Fed Governor and later Fed Chair, Janet Yellen, favored a higher inflation target that would allow for the Fed to take greater action if there was a recession (Sommer, 2023). She argued that, if there is a recession and the inflation rate is already very low, then there would be a high risk of deflation. Although the idea of a more valuable dollar may sound great, many economists think it is worse than high inflation (Engeman, 2019). The problem is that the value of money would increase when people do nothing with it. This would be problematic since people would not invest or spend money to get the country out of a recession when they could just get a return from doing nothing. Instead of taking a risk and investing the money, the velocity of money decreases, and there is less spending leading to higher unemployment and less growth. The cycle could then create more deflation and less spending, putting the country into a self-fulfilling recession cycle.</p>



<p>During the late 1990s, Japan saw the deflationary fear come true, where a deflationary economy created a decades-long stagnation. Combined with the mild 2001 post 9/11 recession, the argument to have a higher inflation target in the U.S. was strengthened (Irwin,2014). Thus, the implicit 1% target started gradually increasing. One analysis of FOMC meetings found that the Fed preferred an implicit target of 1.5 core inflation from 2000 to 2007 (Shaprio, Wilson, 2019). However, after the 2008 recession, the consensus shifted to a compromise of 2% inflation target in line with New Zealand, which was later made official in 2012 by Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, which is still in place today (Shapiro, Wilson, 2019).</p>



<p>The above current events show that an inflation target has some power and inflation seems to show that inflation targets have some power. A study by the IMF confirms this and says, “Nonetheless, empirical evidence on the performance of inflation targeting is broadly, though not totally, supportive of the effectiveness of the framework in delivering low inflation, anchoring inflation expectations, and lowering inflation volatility. Moreover, these gains in inflation performance were achieved with no adverse effects on output and interest volatility” (Jahan, 2010). However, is 2% the right number? The first problem is that if the Fed does change its inflation target, it loses a lot of its credibility, which is what the inflation target’s power comes from.</p>



<p>This loss of trust is a major problem. For example, if you no longer believe the Fed inflation target, then you will base your actions on what you think the inflation rate will be, which can lead to cycles of inflation. If you believe inflation will be high soon, you will buy a lot of stuff now when prices are lower. However, other people will realize this too, and then there will be a race to buy goods and services, which will lead to less supply and higher prices. This creates more demand, which leads to higher prices, creating the inflationary doom loop. Showing that losing the Fed’s credibility may not be worth the benefit of a better target.</p>



<p>The story of the inflation target is one which is much more random and less thought through than you would expect. A politician and central banker which few around the world knew changed world economic history, and created one of the most powerful monetary policy tools. However the world has cemented this target into the core assumptions of the world economy and there would be repercussions all around if we changed the target. Each target has trade offs but perhaps finding an optimal level would lead to a more prosperous world.&nbsp;</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The transformer architecture by Vaswani et al. (2017) is now ubiquitous across application domains, from natural language processing to speech processing and image understanding. We propose DenseFormer, a simple modification to the standard architecture that improves the perplexity of the model without increasing its size -- adding a few thousand parameters for large-scale models in the 100B parameters range. Our approach relies on an additional averaging step after each transformer block, which computes a weighted average of current and past representations -- we refer to this operation as Depth-Weighted-Average (DWA). The learned DWA weights exhibit coherent patterns of information flow, revealing the strong and structured reuse of activations from distant layers. Experiments demonstrate that DenseFormer is more data efficient, reaching the same perplexity of much deeper transformer models, and that for the same perplexity, these new models outperform transformer baselines in terms of memory efficiency and inference time.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Artificial intelligence has recently experienced remarkable advances, fueled by large models, vast datasets, accelerated hardware, and, last but not least, the transformative power of differentiable programming. This new programming paradigm enables end-to-end differentiation of complex computer programs (including those with control flows and data structures), making gradient-based optimization of program parameters possible. As an emerging paradigm, differentiable programming builds upon several areas of computer science and applied mathematics, including automatic differentiation, graphical models, optimization and statistics. This book presents a comprehensive review of the fundamental concepts useful for differentiable programming. We adopt two main perspectives, that of optimization and that of probability, with clear analogies between the two. Differentiable programming is not merely the differentiation of programs, but also the thoughtful design of programs intended for differentiation. By making programs differentiable, we inherently introduce probability distributions over their execution, providing a means to quantify the uncertainty associated with program outputs.

<p><strong>“I’ve been waiting over 20 years for an environmentally friendly successor to Concorde and XB-1’s first flight is a major landmark towards my dreams being realized. When I last flew Concorde in 2003 I knew that this day would come. The first flight of the XB-1 supersonic demonstrator is a significant achievement toward making sustainable supersonic flight a reality, aboard Overture – my #1 choice as the successor to Concorde,”</strong> said Captain Mike Bannister, former Chief Concorde Pilot for British Airways. “Congratulations to Blake Scholl, all at Boom and especially its pilot, Bill “Doc” Shoemaker. Having been Concorde’s Chief Pilot I envy his role in this exciting return towards mainstream supersonic flight.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The XB-1 program provides the foundation for Overture’s design and development, while establishing a safety-first culture in engineering and manufacturing. XB-1 validates key technologies and Boom’s own innovations, including:</p>

<p>It is fitting that XB-1 took off for the first time from the Mojave Air &amp; Space Port, in airspace known as the home of many firsts in the world of aviation and aerospace. This region in the Mojave Desert is the proving grounds for the aerospace industry, where an aircraft broke the sound barrier for the first time in 1947 and where speed and altitude records are set.</p>



<p>Now that XB-1 has successfully completed its first flight, the team will systematically expand the flight envelope to confirm its performance and handling qualities through and beyond Mach 1. When XB-1 is ready for its first supersonic flight, Test Pilot Tristan “Geppetto” Brandenberg will be at the controls.</p>

<p>Overture will carry 64-80 passengers at Mach 1.7, about twice the speed of today’s subsonic airliners. Optimized for speed, safety, and sustainability, Overture is designed to run on up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).</p>



<p>“Boom Supersonic’s remarkable achievements are a testament to the power of dreaming and doing,” said Amy Spowart, President &amp; CEO of The National Aeronautical Association. “Like Sir Frank Whittle, Blake, and Boom, achieved what others tried and no other could with XB-1. Congratulations to the XB-1 team, including Chief Test Pilot, Bill “Doc” Shoemaker! The National Aeronautic Association looks forward to celebrating your milestones in the historic fashion of the shoulders on which we all stand.”</p>
