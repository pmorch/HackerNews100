In this paper, we identify and characterize artifacts in feature maps of both supervised and self-supervised ViT networks. The artifacts correspond to high-norm tokens appearing during inference primarily in low-informative background areas of images, that are repurposed for internal computations. We propose a simple yet effective solution based on providing additional tokens to the input sequence of the Vision Transformer to fill that role. We show that this solution fixes that problem entirely for both supervised and self-supervised models, sets a new state of the art for self-supervised visual models on dense visual prediction tasks, enables object discovery methods with larger models, and most importantly leads to smoother feature maps and attention maps for downstream visual processing.</span></p><p><strong>Anonymous Url<!-- -->:</strong> <span>I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.</span></p><p><strong>No Acknowledgement Section<!-- -->:</strong> <span>I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.</span></p><p><strong>Primary Area<!-- -->:</strong> <span>unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning</span></p><p><strong>Submission Number<!-- -->:</strong> <span>3647</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

    </div><p>Researchers at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine have shed new light on the changes in metabolism that occur between birth and the presentation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) later in childhood. The researchers discovered that a small number of biochemical pathways are responsible for the majority of these changes, which could help inform new early detection and prevention strategies for autism.</p>

                                        
                                                                                  
                                        
                                                                                                                                    
<p>"At birth, the physical appearance and behavior of a child who will develop <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/autism/" rel="tag">autism</a> over the next few years are indistinguishable from that of a neurotypical child. Indeed, in most cases the fate of the child with regard to autism is not set at birth," said Robert Naviaux, M.D., Ph.D., professor in the Departments of Medicine, Pediatrics and Pathology at UC San Diego School of Medicine.</p>
<p>"We're starting to learn about the governing dynamics that regulate the transition from risk to the actual appearance of the first symptoms of ASD. Early diagnosis opens the possibility of early intervention and optimal outcomes."</p>
<p>ASD is a <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/developmental+disorder/" rel="tag">developmental disorder</a> characterized by difficulties in socializing and communication, as well as repetitive and/or restrictive behaviors. For the majority of people with ASD, the condition is a significant disability, with only 10–20% of children diagnosed before 5 years of age able to live independently as adults.</p>
<p>While autism is known to have strong genetic risk factors, there are also environmental risk factors that play a role in the development and severity of ASD. Naviaux and other researchers are discovering that the development of autism is governed by the real-time interaction of these varied factors. By studying the developmental biology of <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metabolism/" rel="tag">metabolism</a> and how it differs in autism, new insights are emerging in ASD and other complex developmental disorders.</p>

                                                                                                        <!-- Google middle Adsense block -->
    
                                                                                                                                            <p>"Behavior and metabolism are linked—you cannot separate them," added Naviaux.</p>
<p>To learn more about the early metabolic changes that occur in children with autism, researchers studied two cohorts of children. One cohort consisted of newborn children, in whom autism can't be detected. The second cohort consisted of 5-year-old children, some of whom had been diagnosed with autism.</p>
<p>When comparing the metabolic profiles of children in the cohort who were eventually diagnosed with autism to those who developed neurotypically, they found striking differences. Of the 50 different biochemical pathways the researchers investigated, just 14 were responsible for 80% of the metabolic impact of autism.</p>
<p>The pathways that were most changed are related to the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23981537/" target="_blank">cell danger response</a>, a natural and universal cellular reaction to injury or metabolic stress. The body has biochemical safeguards in place that can shut down the cell danger response once the threat has passed, and Naviaux hypothesizes that autism occurs when these safeguards fail to develop normally. The result is heightened sensitivity to <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/environmental+stimuli/" rel="tag">environmental stimuli</a>, and this effect contributes to sensory sensitivities and other symptoms associated with autism.</p>
<p>"Metabolism is the language that the brain, gut and immune system use to communicate, and autism occurs when the communication between these systems is changed," added Naviaux.</p>

                                                                                                                                            <p>The cell danger response is primarily regulated by <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adenosine+triphosphate/" rel="tag">adenosine triphosphate</a> (ATP) the body's chemical energy currency. While these ATP-signaling pathways do not develop normally in autism, they may be partially restorable with existing <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/pharmaceutical+drugs/" rel="tag">pharmaceutical drugs</a>. In 2017, Naviaux and his team completed early clinical testing for suramin, the only drug approved in humans that can target ATP signaling and which is normally used to treat African sleeping sickness.</p>
<p>Now, the researchers hope that by revealing the specific ATP-related pathways that are altered in autism, their work will help scientists develop more drugs that target these pathways to manage the symptoms of ASD.</p>
<p>"Suramin is just one drug that targets the cell danger response," he said. "Now that we're closely interrogating how metabolism changes in ASD, we could be at the beginning of a drug renaissance that will create new options for treatment that never existed before."</p>
<p>The study is published in the journal <i>Communications Biology</i>.</p>

            <p><big><span>What is different
in PeaZip?</span></big><br>
            </p>
            <p>The project started aiming to provide features often
overlooked in applications of the same type.<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><span>Be CLI-friendly</span>:
bridge the gap between GUI and
CLI applications to offer the best of the two worlds, blending the
archive manager into a <span>scripting
engine</span> to automate compression / archiving / backup /
extraction... <span></span>tasks.<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>From
"Console"
tab in archiving and extraction screens, the tasks defined in the GUI
can be exported as CLI scripts, i.e. for reuse, syntax learning or
inspection purpose, of for refining the tasks beyond the capabilities
of the GUI.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><span>Offer two factor
authentication</span> (password + keyfile)
for all formats supporting encryption, to increase security against
guessing and dictionary based attacks on weak passwords.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span>Provide a GUI for
less commonly supported compression
formats</span> - which comes from very interesting research threads in
compression field, like the very powerful compressor zpaq or very
fast ones as brotli, and zstandard - and provide a platform-agnostic
GUI for 7z/p7zip on non-Windows systems.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span>Provide multiple
file management features</span> each of
whom meeting the needs of different use cases, like verification of a
wide array of checksum and hash functions, find duplicates, <span>convert archives</span>, <span>search in
archives</span>, bookmarks, <span>tabbed
browsing</span>, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span>Deploy all the above
in a tool which is natively portable</span>, can
be used from removable devices or shared on a network / cloud, without
installation, and offers the same UX on all operating systems and
desktop
environments.</li>
            </ul>

As archive manager utility, PeaZip provides
fast,
high compression ratio multi-format archiving to 7Z, ARC, Brotli, BZ2,
GZ,
PEA,
TAR, WIM, Zstandard and ZIP archives (write supported formats), and
works as

/ extractor tool
for
200+ archive types including ACE, ISO, RAR, ZIPX files, including
ability to manage encrypted archives for supported formats. </p><p>
            
This software deploys a powerful and complete file
manager for editing, viewing, browsing and searching archive files,
featuring a
wide set of data security functions: <a href="https://peazip.github.io/encrypt-files.html">strong
encryption</a> (AES, Twofish, Serpent),
encrypted password manager, optional two-factor authentication
(encryption / decryption with password and keyfile), <a href="https://peazip.github.io/secure-delete.html">secure

page.</p><p>
            
(*) To use the application to open and extract <span>ACE </span>files
it
is needed to install WinACE's UNACE plugin from PLUGINS page, otherwise
the program will lack the (proprietary) component to read .ace format.<br>
(**) <a href="https://peazip.github.io/free-rar-create.html">RAR files creation</a> with PeaZip
is possible if WinRar
is installed on the system (autonomous support to rar compression is
not possible due to rar licensing limitations). Please note <span>RAR </span>and <span>RAR5 </span>format opening / extraction is
supported out of the box: an optional plugin based on official RarLab's
unrar code is provided as alternative .rar extraction engine on PLUGINS
page, if preferred by user over 7-Zip / p7zip's Open Source unrar
implementation.</p>
