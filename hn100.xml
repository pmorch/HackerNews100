<p>There has been a lot more churn on the November Top500 supercomputer rankings that is the talk of the SC24 conference in Atlanta this week than there was in the list that came out in June at the ISC24 conference in Hamburg, Germany back in May, and there are some interesting developments in the new machinery that is being installed.</p>
<p>The big news, of course, is that the long-awaited “El Capitan” system being built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise with hybrid CPU-GPU compute engines from AMD is up and running and is, as expected, the new top flopper on the rankings. And by a wide margin over its competition in the United States and the rumored specifications of exascale-class machines in China.</p>
<p>A substantial portion of El Capitan – we don’t yet know how big of a portion yet as we write this – with 43,808 of AMD’s “Antares-A” Instinct MI300A devices (by our math) has been tested by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on a variety of benchmarks, including the High Performance Linpack test that has been used to rank supercomputers since 1993. The part of El Capitan that was tested using HPL has a peak theoretical performance of 2,746.4 petaflops, which is significantly higher than the 2.3 exaflops to 2.5 exaflops that we were expecting. (This is, of course, for floating point math at 64-bit precision.) The peak sustained performance on the HPL test is 1,742 petaflops, which yields a computational efficiency of 63.4 percent. This is about the level of efficiency that we expect when a new accelerated system comes to market (our touchstone is 65 percent), and we expect in subsequent rankings in 2025 that El Capitan will bring more of its theoretical capacity to bear on benchmarks as the system works its way towards acceptance by Lawrence Livermore.</p>
<p>As a reminder, <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/12/06/amd-is-the-undisputed-datacenter-gpu-performance-champ-for-now/">the MI300A was revealed alongside its MI300X sibling</a> (which has eight GPU chiplets and no CPU cores) back in December 2023. The MI300A has three chiplets with two dozen “Genoa” Epyc cores in total and six chiplets of Antares GPU streaming multiprocessors running at 1.8 GHz. In the Cray EX systems, all of the MI300A compute engines are linked to each other with HPE’s “Rosetta” Slingshot 11 Ethernet interconnect. All told, there are 1.05 million Genoa cores and just a hair under 10 million streaming multiprocessors on the GPU chiplets in the section of El Capitan tested. This is obviously an enormous amount of concurrency to manage. But it is not crazy. The Sunway “TaihuLight” supercomputer at the National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi, China, which has been on the Top500 rankings since 2016 and is still the fifteenth most powerful machine in the world (of those tested using HPL at least) had a total of 10.65 million cores.</p>
<p>We will be drilling down into the architecture of the El Capitan machine separately after a briefing at SC24 by Lawrence Livermore, and we will crosslink to that story here.</p>
<p>Each Top500 list is a mix of old and new machinery, and as new machines are tested using HPL and their owners submit results, the less powerful machines that were on the prior list fall off and are no longer part of the Top500 universe – even if they are still being used. Moreover, many machines in the United States, Europe, and China that do not do HPC simulation and modeling as their day jobs are included in the list because companies and their OEM partners want to rig the list. Having HPL information on generic clusters is interesting, but it distorts the rankings of supposed supercomputers. To be honest, we have only really looked at the Top50 machines as true supercomputers for a long time and have sought to come up with some way to make this ranking more useful.</p>
<p>Back in June, we decided to only look at the new entrants on the list to try to use this as a gauge of what was happening in HPC. And we are once again going to dice and slice the November 2024 rankings and see what people have recently bought and tested. There are some interesting trends, and we intend to keep an eye on these changes in this manner from this point forward.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2024/05/15/top500-supers-nvidia-utterly-dominates-those-shiny-new-machines/">With the June 2024 rankings</a>, there were 49 new machines on the Top500 list, and of the 1,226.7 petaflops of aggregate peak performance at 64-bit floating point precision across these new machines, seven new supercomputers – and they really were supercomputers doing HPC work – based on Nvidia’s “Grace” Arm server CPUs and “Hopper” H100 GPU accelerators accounted for a combined 663.7 petaflops of peak, or 54.1 percent of the additional capacity that came onto the June 2024 list. Systems using AMD Epyc processors combined with Nvidia GPUs accounted for another 8.1 percent of new compute capacity, and systems using Intel Xeon processors combined with Nvidia GPUs made up another 17.5 percent of the capacity installed between late November 2023 and early June 2024 and tested using HPL. There were another 23 all-CPU machines, which are still necessary in a lot of HPC environments for software compatibility, but the aggregate compute in these machines still only comprised 12.1 percent of all new 64-bit flops.</p>
<p>This time around, on the November 2024 Top500 rankings, AMD is the big winner in terms of adding capacity to the HPC base. There are 61 new machines on the list, and here they are sorted by compute engine architecture:</p>
<figure id="attachment_145003" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145003"><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-new-system-salients.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-145003"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-new-system-salients.jpg" alt="" width="1431" height="1349" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-new-system-salients.jpg 1431w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-new-system-salients-768x724.jpg 768w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-new-system-salients-600x566.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1431px) 100vw, 1431px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-145003">Click to enlarge</figcaption></figure>
<p>This time around, there are only four new Grace-Hopper systems, and they are fairly modest in size and only represent 3.8 percent of the 5,211.6 petaflops of aggregate peak performance for the new machines on the list.</p>
<p>There are, however, 25 new machines that have Intel Xeon CPUs on the host and Nvidia GPUs as offload engines, and these combine to have 969.6 aggregate petaflops of compute or 18.6 percent of the total new compute on the list. Interestingly, Dell built a 5.3 petaflops machine, nicknamed “IronMan,” for its own use that pairs AMD Instinct MI300A accelerators with Intel Xeon CPUs. (<em>Why?</em>) And there are eleven machines that have AMD Epyc CPU hosts supporting Nvidia GPU accelerators, with a total of 247.7 petaflops of peak oomph. The combined Nvidia GPU machines made up 39 percent of the total compute added for the November 2024 Top500 list.</p>
<p>El Capitan and four of its smaller siblings based on the MI300A hybrid compute engines just blew Nvidia away this time around, with 3,134.6 petaflops of FP64 oomph and representing 60.1 percent of the total compute coming all shiny and new to the current Top500 list. Thanks largely to the HPC6 machine being installed at Eni SpA in Italy, <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2024/01/24/energy-giant-eni-boosts-its-hpc-oomph-by-an-order-of-magnitude/">which we wrote about back in January</a> and which is basically a smaller clone of the “Frontier” supercomputer installed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States, there is another 619.3 petaflops of oomph that was added in the November list from two machines based on AMD CPUs paired with AMD MI250X GPUs.</p>
<p>Add it all up and AMD GPUs drove 72.1 percent of the new performance added for the November 2024 rankings.</p>
<p>Now, let’s widen the lens out to the complete Top500 list for November and look at all 209 of the accelerated systems in the list. Take a look at how this breaks down in this pretty treemap:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-accelerator-type-chart.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-145002"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-accelerator-type-chart.jpg" alt="" width="918" height="532" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-accelerator-type-chart.jpg 918w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-accelerator-type-chart-768x445.jpg 768w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-accelerator-type-chart-600x348.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 918px) 100vw, 918px"></a></p>
<p>The box sizes in the chart above represent aggregate sustained performance on HPL.</p>
<p>That green neighborhood in the upper left is anchored by El Capitan and Frontier and includes all machines that use a combination of AMD CPUs and GPUs. Nvidia Grace-Hopper machines are in the upper right, and machines using various Nvidia GPUs are in the blue, gray, and red boxes; Intel GPU machines (the few that there are) are in the teal at the bottom right, and the burnt orange machines are CPU-only systems.</p>
<p>Just for fun, we sorted the 209 accelerated machines on the list by accelerator type and aggregated system counts, peak teraflops, and total cores by architecture. Have a gander at this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-accelerator-table-tnp.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-145001"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-accelerator-table-tnp.jpg" alt="" width="573" height="302"></a></p>
<p>At this point, the machines using the Intel “Ponte Vecchio” Max GPU accelerators represent only four systems (1.9 percent of the 500), but 14 percent of the peak performance, and the overwhelming majority of that comes from the “Aurora” system installed at Argonne National Laboratory.</p>
<p>There are 183 machines that use Nvidia GPUs with any manner of hosts, and they comprise 87.6 percent of installed accelerated machines on the November 2024 list but only 40.3 percent of aggregate peak capacity at FP64 precision. There are 19 machines using AMD GPUs for the bulk of their compute, and that is only 9.1 percent of the accelerated machines. But that is 44.9 percent of aggregate peak FP64 capacity. Thanks to El Capitan, Frontier, HPC6, and sixteen other machines, AMD now has beaten Nvidia on this front on the Top500 list.</p>
<p>If you look across all 500 machines on the list, accelerated systems represent 41.8 percent of machines, 83.4 percent of the aggregate 17,705 petaflops, and 55.4 percent of the 128.6 million total cores plus streaming multiprocessors on the November 2024 list.</p>
<h3>Looking At Broader Trends</h3>
<p>It has been harder to break through the exascale barrier than many had thought, and this is due mostly to constraints on budgets and power consumption, not to any underlying technical issue. The exascale machines in China – “Tianhe-3” and “OceanLight” – have not submitted formal HPL performance results to the Top500 organizers and therefore are not ranked, but they show that if you don’t care about how much power you use or the cost of the machines, then getting exascale machines in the field a few years ago was not only possible, but done. (<a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/11/13/top500-supercomputers-who-gets-the-most-out-of-peak-performance/">Our best guess from a year ago</a> was that Tianhe-3 had a peak FP64 performance of 2.05 exaflops and OceanLight was at 1.5 exaflops.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-performance-over-time.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-145004"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-performance-over-time.jpg" alt="" width="766" height="594" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-performance-over-time.jpg 766w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-performance-over-time-600x465.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px"></a></p>
<p>The bottom of the Top500 list is really having trouble keeping pace with the log plot that we expect for HPC systems historically, and we have no reason to believe that future 10 exaflops and larger machines, should they materialize, will pull up the class average. If we want to get back on the log curve, machines have to get less expensive, and they are getting more expensive even as the cost per unit of performance keeps going down.</p>
<p>This time around, to get onto the Top500 required a machine that had at least 2.31 petaflops on the HPL benchmark. The entry into the Top100 was 12.8 petaflops. Interestingly, the aggregate HPL performance on the list is 11.72 exaflops, up from 8.21 exaflops in June 2024, 7.01 exaflops in November 2023, and 5.24 exaflops in June 2023. Those big machines are pulling up the aggregate performance, but smaller HPC centers are not adding capacity fast enough to double it every two years across the five hundred machines on the list. This may coincide with the rise of HPC on the cloud, or not. It is hard to say without some data from the cloud builders.</p>

          <h2>Basic explainer</h2>
          <p>Google Scholar is a tool that helps researchers find and read research papers. It started 20 years ago, and it's been growing ever since.  It's like a giant library for research, with lots of cool features. You can even use it to find legal cases, save articles, and follow your favorite authors.  It's been used in some surprising ways, like helping people reconnect with family history and even getting marriage proposals!</p>

        <p data-block-key="7l8nl">Google Scholar, a tool used by researchers around the world, was founded by two researchers. We started Scholar in 2004, physically delivering hard drives to the office (see fact number 2), and two decades later adding new AI features (see fact number 6). To celebrate 20 years of Google Scholar, here are 20 fun facts about its origins, how you can use it and what’s new.</p>
      </div>
  

  
    

  

  
    <div data-component="uni-article-paragraph" data-analytics-module="{
           &quot;module_name&quot;: &quot;Paragraph&quot;,
           &quot;section_header&quot;: &quot;20 things you didn’t know about Google Scholar&quot;
         }"><h2 data-block-key="54fr1">The early days</h2><p data-block-key="5kgpf"><b>1. The team started with just two of us.</b> Back in 2004, access to academic information was difficult to navigate and often restricted behind paywalls. We wanted to make it possible for researchers to be able to find and read what their peers had written. After nine months of development, our vision came to life as Google Scholar, which would end up making it easy for people to discover and engage with research.</p><p data-block-key="fouk8"><b>2. We physically delivered files at first.</b> In the early days of Google Scholar, slow, flaky internet speeds made it hard to gather research to build this online research library. As a workaround, the team embraced a low-tech solution dubbed the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet">Sneakernet.</a>” Instead of relying solely on slow downloads, publishers would load articles on physical hard drives and we would pick up these drives on the way to the office.</p><p data-block-key="atfso"><b>3. A baby set the deadline for launching Scholar.</b> It was crunch time leading up to Thanksgiving, and Alex was awaiting the birth of his son, Nicholas. He was heading out on paternity leave shortly, but we still had a lot of work to bring Scholar into the world. We pulled some all-nighters to meet our deadline — and to make sure Alex wouldn’t miss the birth of his child.</p><p data-block-key="3fuma"><b>4. Scholar’s product motto pays tribute to our fellow researchers.</b> In the research community, we build on the foundation laid by others, hence our product motto: “Standing on the shoulders of giants.” It's a testament to the collaborative nature of discovery and Scholar’s goal to help researchers everywhere readily access and build upon the accumulated knowledge of those who have come before. We hope to always be able to help researchers everywhere see further.</p><p data-block-key="5fp45"><b>5. Our goal is to make Scholar comprehensive.</b> Imagine a library with tons of books, articles and research papers, in numerous languages, from every corner of the world. That’s what we aim to do with Scholar. On its index, you can find peer-reviewed online academic journals and books, conference papers, theses and dissertations, preprints, abstracts, technical reports and other scholarly literature.</p></div>

Review a paper efficiently and effectively with AI outlines.</b> We recently added<a href="https://scholar.googleblog.com/2024/11/ai-outlines-in-scholar-pdf-reader-skim.html"> AI outlines</a> to <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/google-scholar-pdf-reader/dahenjhkoodjbpjheillcadbppiidmhp?utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=scholar.googleblog.com&amp;utm_campaign=kp&amp;utm_content=top">Scholar PDF Reader</a> to help you read papers both quickly and in depth. PDF reader provides a one-click preview of cited articles, linked figure and table mentions, citing and related articles. Now with AI outlines, you can quickly grasp the main points or delve into specific details that pique your interest, explore methods, results, discussions or any intriguing nuance.</p><p data-block-key="4b8k5"><b>7. Unlock the law with Scholar’s “Case law” button.</b> For most of the first 250 years of U.S. history, accessing legal documents was a challenge because they weren't easily accessible. But thanks to Google Scholar's comprehensive case law collection, anyone can explore the laws that govern them. Just select "Case law" below the search bar, type your query and dive in.</p><p data-block-key="1ip9q"><b>8. Copy article citations in the style of your choice.</b> No more manually formatting bibliographies. With a click of the "cite" button, Google Scholar provides ready-to-use citations in a number of different formats. Simply select and use the style you need.</p><p data-block-key="22ure"><b>9. Celebrate research milestones.</b> At Scholar, we know how hard it is to reach the finish line. That’s why we take celebrating milestones pretty seriously and have a <a href="https://x.com/search?q=%22google+scholar%22+balloons+citations&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top">balloon display</a> on the Scholar homepage for users who reach a milestone number of citations.</p></div>

         }"><h2 data-block-key="deg3o">Tools and tricks to make the most out of Scholar</h2><p data-block-key="f6ff3"><b>10. Expand your access to research.</b>Today Google Scholar partners with libraries and publishers worldwide to ensure access to subscription-based articles directly within your search results. And if a free version exists (like a preprint), Scholar will point you there, too.</p><p data-block-key="4huak"><b>11. Create your own research library.</b> With Google Scholar, you can save articles to your personal library with a single click. Organize your research, create custom folders and access your library from anywhere with an internet connection.</p><p data-block-key="65ig"><b>12. Become a research “superfan.”</b> In the fast-paced world of academia, staying current is essential. On Scholar, you can follow specific authors to receive email alerts every time they publish something new. This feature allows researchers and students to easily track new discoveries, trends, debates and stay up-to-date on the latest research from the people who matter most to you and of course your competitors.</p><p data-block-key="ep5f9"><b>13. More papers, not less, during the pandemic:</b> Library subscriptions are usually available only while you’re on campus. Once you go home you lose all access. When COVID-19 hit, researchers everywhere were locked out of their labs and worked from home. Thanks to work we had done with publisher partners on portable subscriptions — Scholar’s off-campus access program — researchers could still get their work done. In fact, during the pandemic, researchers read and wrote more than ever before, leading to a sharp jump in papers published between 2020 and 2021.</p></div>

Talk about a blast from the past.</p><p data-block-key="aknpt"><b>15. Users have professed their love for Scholar. (We’re blushing.)</b> At the peak of finals season, Scholar has received marriage proposals from grateful students with some taking <a href="https://x.com/AnnaHastings6/status/552503017770319874">to social media</a> to share their love (and sometimes even propose marriage.).</p></div>

Think your research abstract is concise? Think again.</b> Check out this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2832">physics abstract</a> that contains only two words — “Probably not.” It's proof that sometimes, less is more (at least in the world of academic publishing).</p><p data-block-key="eegt7"><b>18.

Chester’s starring role came about because his co-author/owner, Jack H. Hetherington wrote the entire paper with the plural “we” instead of a single “I.”</p><p data-block-key="4tm7n"><b>19. Unusual research mashups.</b> 2020 brought COVID-19 into research of every kind. We found nearly every topic you can think of having a paper on its association with COVID.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        <article id="post-289503">
                                

                            <p>U.S. consumers risk using flooring products made of wood illegally logged from Cambodia’s rainforests, a recent <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2024/10/cambodian-logging-syndicate-tied-to-major-u-s-wood-flooring-supply-chains/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span>Mongabay investigation</span></a> suggests.</p>
<p>The investigation focused on companies in Cambodia’s Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone (SEZ) that manufacture furniture and engineered wood flooring for the U.S. market. One company in particular, Chinese-owned Nature Flooring (Cambodia), sources its plywood cores from Angkor Plywood, our team found. Angkor Plywood is a Cambodian company that’s been accused of illegally logging timber from protected areas like <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2023/12/immense-body-of-knowledge-at-stake-in-cambodias-prey-lang-as-deforestation-soars/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span>Prey Lang Wildlife Sanctuary</span></a>.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“</span>We buy from Angkor Plywood … the company provides eucalyptus and acacia, they have their own plantation in Kandal province,” Jin Tian Liao, a translator for Nature Flooring’s management, told Mongabay. He admitted, however, that the company staff had never visited the plantation. <span>“</span>They grow it, we buy it, we produce flooring and sell that to the U.S.,” he said.</p>
<p>Past investigations have found that <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2020/05/they-never-intended-to-conserve-it-outcry-as-loggers-gut-cambodian-reserve/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span>Angkor Plywood</span></a>, co-owned by former logger Chea Pov and Taiwanese national Lu Chu Chang, doesn’t have a plantation in Kandal, only a factory.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Chang also heads Think Biotech, a company later rebranded to Holy Plantation, that, on paper, has a timber plantation in Kratie province on the border of Prey Lang Wildlife Sanctuary. While Jin indicated Nature Flooring was buying acacia and eucalyptus from this plantation, Holy Plantation has been accused of relying heavily on wood illegally logged from inside Prey Lang rather than timber that<span>’</span>s plantation-grown.</p>
<p><span>“</span>They [Nature Flooring] themselves don<span>’</span>t know what it is that they<span>’</span>re selling,” a timber industry insider told Mongabay, adding that minimal testing is done to check the species or origin of the wood. <span>“</span>If the customers in the U.S. who actually want a green home … realize they<span>’</span>re actually walking on a jungle that they helped to cut down, people will get upset.”</p>
<p>Nature Flooring has had recurring issues with tracing the origin of the wood it purchases. In 2017, the company had to <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2017/08/us-retailers-halt-sales-of-hardwood-flooring-linked-to-illegal-logging-in-png/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span>stop importing wood</span></a> from Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands after being accused of purchasing illegally harvested wood.</p>
<p>At the same time, Nature Flooring’s parent company, Nature Home, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231202055334/https:/www.nature-cn.cn/overseas.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span>claims</span></a> to be a “green” company on its website.</p>
<p>Mongabay’s investigation suggests that Nature Flooring sells the plywood it sources from Angkor Plywood to factories like Fine Flooring, a subsidiary of Pennsylvania-based AHF Products, which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ahfproducts.com/en-us/solutions.html%2523:~:text=AHF%2525252520is%2525252520the%2525252520largest%2525252520wood,,%2525252520hickory,%2525252520maple%2525252520and%2525252520walnut." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span>claims to be the largest U.S. wood flooring manufacturer</span></a>. When contacted, AHF told Mongabay in an emailed response that it “does not use any illegally harvested wood products.”</p>
<p>“We have a rigorous supplier vetting and compliance program to verify all wood products are legally sourced. Any inferences to the contrary are simply not true,” AHF said.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mailcatcher.me/">https://mailcatcher.me/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42174231">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
  

<p>Catches mail and serves it through a dream.</p>
<p>MailCatcher runs a super simple SMTP server which catches any message sent to it to display in a web interface. Run mailcatcher, set your favourite app to deliver to smtp://127.0.0.1:1025 instead of your default SMTP server, then check out <a href="http://127.0.0.1:1080/" rel="nofollow">http://127.0.0.1:1080</a> to see the mail that's arrived so far.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14028/14093249/4100f904-f598-11e5-936b-e6a396f18e39.png"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14028/14093249/4100f904-f598-11e5-936b-e6a396f18e39.png" alt="MailCatcher screenshot"></a></p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Catches all mail and stores it for display.</li>
<li>Shows HTML, Plain Text and Source version of messages, as applicable.</li>
<li>Rewrites HTML enabling display of embedded, inline images/etc and opens links in a new window.</li>
<li>Lists attachments and allows separate downloading of parts.</li>
<li>Download original email to view in your native mail client(s).</li>
<li>Command line options to override the default SMTP/HTTP IP and port settings.</li>
<li>Mail appears instantly if your browser supports <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-socket-protocol/" rel="nofollow">WebSockets</a>, otherwise updates every thirty seconds.</li>
<li>Runs as a daemon in the background, optionally in foreground.</li>
<li>Sendmail-analogue command, <code>catchmail</code>, makes using mailcatcher from PHP a lot easier.</li>
<li>Keyboard navigation between messages</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how">How</h2>
<ol>
<li><code>gem install mailcatcher</code></li>
<li><code>mailcatcher</code></li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:1080/" rel="nofollow">http://127.0.0.1:1080/</a></li>
<li>Send mail through smtp://127.0.0.1:1025</li>
</ol>
<p>Use <code>mailcatcher --help</code> to see the command line options. The brave can get the source from <a href="https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher">the GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<h3>Bundler</h3>
<p>Please don't put mailcatcher into your Gemfile. It will conflict with your applications gems at some point.</p>
<p>Instead, pop a note in your README stating you use mailcatcher, and to run <code>gem install mailcatcher</code> then <code>mailcatcher</code> to get started.</p>
<h3>RVM</h3>
<p>Under RVM your mailcatcher command may only be available under the ruby you install mailcatcher into. To prevent this, and to prevent gem conflicts, install mailcatcher into a dedicated gemset with a wrapper script:</p>
<pre><code>rvm default@mailcatcher --create do gem install mailcatcher
ln -s "$(rvm default@mailcatcher do rvm wrapper show mailcatcher)" "$rvm_bin_path/"
</code></pre>
<h3>Rails</h3>
<p>To set up your rails app, I recommend adding this to your <code>environments/development.rb</code>:</p>
<pre><code>config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = { :address =&gt; '127.0.0.1', :port =&gt; 1025 }
config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = false
</code></pre>
<h3>PHP</h3>
<p>For projects using PHP, or PHP frameworks and application platforms like Drupal, you can set <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/mail.configuration.php" rel="nofollow">PHP's mail configuration</a> in your <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.php" rel="nofollow">php.ini</a> to send via MailCatcher with:</p>
<pre><code>sendmail_path = /usr/bin/env catchmail -f some@from.address
</code></pre>
<p>You can do this in your <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.php" rel="nofollow">Apache configuration</a> like so:</p>
<pre><code>php_admin_value sendmail_path "/usr/bin/env catchmail -f some@from.address"
</code></pre>
<p>If you've installed via RVM this probably won't work unless you've manually added your RVM bin paths to your system environment's PATH. In that case, run <code>which catchmail</code> and put that path into the <code>sendmail_path</code> directive above instead of <code>/usr/bin/env catchmail</code>.</p>
<p>If starting <code>mailcatcher</code> on alternative SMTP IP and/or port with parameters like <code>--smtp-ip 192.168.0.1 --smtp-port 10025</code>, add the same parameters to your <code>catchmail</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>sendmail_path = /usr/bin/env catchmail --smtp-ip 192.160.0.1 --smtp-port 10025 -f some@from.address
</code></pre>
<h3>Django</h3>
<p>For use in Django, add the following configuration to your projects' settings.py</p>
<div><pre><span>if</span> <span>DEBUG</span>:
    <span>EMAIL_HOST</span> <span>=</span> <span>'127.0.0.1'</span>
    <span>EMAIL_HOST_USER</span> <span>=</span> <span>''</span>
    <span>EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD</span> <span>=</span> <span>''</span>
    <span>EMAIL_PORT</span> <span>=</span> <span>1025</span>
    <span>EMAIL_USE_TLS</span> <span>=</span> <span>False</span></pre></div>
<h3>API</h3>
<p>A fairly RESTful URL schema means you can download a list of messages in JSON from <code>/messages</code>, each message's metadata with <code>/messages/:id.json</code>, and then the pertinent parts with <code>/messages/:id.html</code> and <code>/messages/:id.plain</code> for the default HTML and plain text version, <code>/messages/:id/:cid</code> for individual attachments by CID, or the whole message with <code>/messages/:id.source</code>.</p>
<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mail processing is fairly basic but easily modified. If something doesn't work for you, fork and fix it or <a href="https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher/issues">file an issue</a> and let me know. Include the whole message you're having problems with.</li>
<li>Encodings are difficult. MailCatcher does not completely support utf-8 straight over the wire, you must use a mail library which encodes things properly based on SMTP server capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add mail delivery on request, optionally multiple times.</li>
<li>Compatibility testing against CampaignMonitor's <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/design-guidelines/" rel="nofollow">design guidelines</a> and <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/" rel="nofollow">CSS support matrix</a>.</li>
<li>Forward mail to rendering service, maybe CampaignMonitor?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>
<p>MailCatcher is just a mishmash of other people's hard work. Thank you so much to the people who have built the wonderful guts on which this project relies.</p>
<h2 id="donations">Donations</h2>
<p>I work on MailCatcher mostly in my own spare time. If you've found Mailcatcher useful and would like to help feed me and fund continued development and new features, please <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=522WUPLRWUSKE" rel="nofollow">donate via PayPal</a>. If you'd like a specific feature added to MailCatcher and are willing to pay for it, please <a href="mailto:sj26@sj26.com">email me</a>.</p>

    <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN, I’m Hunter the founder of Regatta Storage (<a href="https://regattastorage.com/">https://regattastorage.com</a>). Regatta Storage is a new cloud file system that provides unlimited pay-as-you-go capacity, local-like performance, and automatic synchronization to S3-compatible storage. For example, you can use Regatta to instantly access massive data sets in S3 with Spark, Pytorch, or pandas without paying for large, local disks or waiting for the data to download.</p><p>Check out an overview of how the service works here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh1q5p7E4JY" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh1q5p7E4JY</a>, and you can try it for free at <a href="https://regattastorage.com/">https://regattastorage.com</a> after signing up for an account. We wanted to let you try it without an account, but we figured that “Hacker News shares a file system and S3 bucket” wouldn’t be the best experience for the community.</p><p>I built Regatta after spending nearly a decade building and operating at-scale cloud storage at places like Amazon’s Elastic File System (EFS) and Netflix. During my 8 years at EFS, I learned a lot about how teams thought about their storage usage. Users frequently told me that they loved how simple and scalable EFS was, and -- like S3 -- they didn’t have to guess how much capacity they needed up front.</p><p>When I got to Netflix, I was surprised that there wasn’t more usage of EFS. If you looked around, it seemed like a natural fit. Every application needed a POSIX file system. Lots of applications had unclear or spikey storage needs. Often, developers wanted their storage to last beyond the lifetime of an individual instance or container. In fact, if you looked across all Netflix applications, some ridiculous amount of money was being spent on <i>empty storage space</i> because each of these local drives had to be overprovisioned for potential usage.</p><p>I tried to evangelize EFS, but I got consistent pushback. Other engineers told me that NFS was slow or chatty and couldn’t deliver adequate performance for their applications. Most of these applications were transferring data from S3 for analysis, and then uploading some set of results. Using EFS as the backing storage system meant that the teams would need to “clean up” this temporary data when the jobs were done.</p><p>At this point, I realized that there was a missing solution in the cloud storage market which wasn’t being filled by either block or file storage, and I decided to build Regatta.</p><p>Regatta is a pay-as-you-go cloud file system that automatically expands with your application. Because it automatically synchronizes with S3 using native file formats, you can connect it to existing data sets and use recently written file data directly from S3. When data isn’t actively being used, it’s removed from the Regatta cache, so you only pay for the backing S3 storage. Finally, we’re developing a custom file protocol which allows us to achieve local-like performance for small-file workloads <i>and</i> Lustre-like scale-out performance for distributed data jobs.</p><p>Under the hood, customers mount a Regatta file system by connecting to our fleet of caching instances over NFSv3 (soon, our custom protocol). Our instances then connect to the customer’s S3 bucket on the backend, and provide sub-millisecond cached-read and write performance. This durable cache allows us to provide a strongly consistent, efficient view of the file system to all connected file clients. We can perform challenging operations (like directory renaming) quickly and durably, while they asynchronously propagate to the S3 bucket.</p><p>We’re excited to see users share our vision for Regatta. We have teams who are using us to build totally serverless Jupyter notebook servers for their AI researchers who prefer to upload and share data using the S3 web UI. We have teams who are using us as a distributed caching layer on top of S3 for low-latency access to common files. We have teams who are replacing their thin-provisioned Ceph boot volumes with Regatta for significant savings. We can’t wait to see what other things people will build and we hope you’ll give us a try at regattastorage.com.</p><p>We’d love to get any early feedback from the community, ideas for future direction, or experiences in this space. I’ll be in the comments for the next few hours to respond!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, my team and I fixed an absolutely bizarre bug that only one person in the team could reproduce. And to make it even weirder, she was only able to reproduce the issue when using her work laptop at home; it worked fine with the same laptop in the office.</p><h2 id="heading-so-what-was-the-bug">So what was the bug?<a href="#heading-so-what-was-the-bug"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>The BBC's UK website uses a <code>click</code> event to respond to when a user activates the 'More' button. <code>click</code> events aren't just activated by the click of a mouse; they can also be activated by touch and the 'enter' or 'space' keys on a keyboard.</p><p><img src="https://www.joshtumath.uk/images/2024-11-08-bbc-global-nav.png" alt="Screenshot of BBC global navigation bar opened using the 'more' button." loading="lazy" width="792" height="280"></p><p>Our 'more' button should open a menu. However, when she was clicking on it at home, the <code>click</code> event didn't seem to do anything. Instead, the menu opened using our no-JavaScript fallback behaviour.</p><p><em>That's strange.</em> 💭</p><p>When we looked into it a bit more, we found out that the bug only happened when her web browser window was on one of her external monitors. She had two external monitors and it happened on both. But when she clicked the button on her laptop screen, the button worked as expected.</p><p><em>What?</em> 🤯</p><p>And to make it even stranger, the bug didn't happen in Safari.</p><p><em>What? What? What?</em> 🤯 🤯 🤯</p><p>So why on earth was something like a user's external monitor set up affecting <code>click</code> events on our website? And why was this bug not happening to everyone else in our team who used an external monitor? It was very strange indeed.</p><h2 id="heading-reproducing-the-issue">Reproducing the issue<a href="#heading-reproducing-the-issue"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>We wanted to be able to reproduce the bug to properly investigate it, so we needed to understand what it was in her home environment that triggered it.</p><p>Since the bug only occurred on her external monitors, we noticed that it stopped if she repositioned them in the OS settings. Her external monitors were positioned above her laptop, so once we replicated that arrangement in our OS settings, we were finally able to reproduce the bug, too.</p><p><em>Bingo!</em></p><p><img src="https://www.joshtumath.uk/images/2024-11-08-multi-monitor-negative.png" alt="Screenshot of macOS display settings. Second monitor is shown arranged top left of the built-in laptop monitor." loading="lazy" width="1516" height="916"></p><h2 id="heading-our-investigation">Our investigation<a href="#heading-our-investigation"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>We had two clues to begin our investigation:</p><ul><li><strong>1st clue:</strong> <mark>The bug didn't occur on Safari</mark>.</li><li><strong>2nd clue:</strong> <mark>The bug only happened when the external monitors were positioned above and left of the main monitor</mark>.</li></ul><p>Our next step was to investigate our 'more' button's <code>click</code> event handler function.</p><p>While reproducing the issue, a <code>console.log</code> of our 'more' button's click event showed our <strong>3rd clue:</strong> that, <mark>on Chrome and Firefox, the <code>screenX</code> and <code>screenY</code> properties were negative numbers</mark>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong><br>Even though they can be triggered by any kind of input, <code>click</code> events are a type of <code>PointerEvent</code>, so their <code>event</code> objects include information about the mouse or touch pointers that trigger the clicks. For example, the <code>screenX</code> and <code>screenY</code> properties show the coordinates (in pixels) for what point on the screen gets clicked on.</p></blockquote><p>That surprised me, because I didn't know those properties were allowed to have negative numbers. I checked the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#dom-mouseevent-screenx">DOM UI Events spec</a> to see if that was correct, but there didn't seem to be any specific information about it.</p><p>With some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwzOhHFGZKw">Ace Attorney Investigations-style logic</a>, when we put together the fact that <mark>the bug didn't occur on Safari</mark> and that, <mark>on Chrome and Firefox, the <code>screenX</code> and <code>screenY</code> properties were negative numbers</mark>, we could deduce that browsers have an interoperability issue in how they represent screen coordinates in multi-monitor set ups.</p><p><img src="https://www.joshtumath.uk/images/2024-11-08-aai-logic.gif" alt="Animation of the logic sequence in Ace Attorney Investigations. The player picks from clues to connect and the game shows if they successfully connected." loading="lazy" width="400" height="225"></p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong><br>I ended up reporting the interoperability issue to the WebKit team on <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=281430">WebKit bug 281430</a>.</p></blockquote><p>That knowledge gave rise to our <strong>4th clue:</strong> <mark>the bug only occurred if <code>screenX</code> and <code>screenY</code> were negative</mark>.</p><p>With some more Ace Attorney Investigations-style deductions, when we combined that with our 2nd clue – that <mark>the bug only happened when the external monitors were positioned above and left of the main monitor</mark> – we could deduce our <strong>5th clue:</strong> <mark>on Chrome and Firefox, the <code>screenX</code> and <code>screenY</code>'s (0,0) coordinate is the top left of the main monitor</mark>.</p><p>On a multi-monitor set up, browsers' screen coordinate systems treat multiple monitors as if it were one big monitor. So two 800px wide monitors positioned horizontally would have <em>x</em> coordinates ranging of 0 to 1600. On Safari, that range is always a positive number starting from the top left most monitor, but it looks like, in Chrome and Firefox, they are relative to the main monitor instead and use negative coordinates.</p><p>We needed to find the <code>click</code> event handler in our code and see how it was reading the <code>screenX</code> and <code>screenY</code> coordinates from the <code>event</code> object.</p><p>This is what we found:</p><pre><code><span><span>const</span> <span>isInvokedByMouse</span> <span>=</span> <span>event</span> <span>=&gt;</span> event<span>.</span>screenX <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span> <span>||</span> event<span>.</span>screenY <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>const</span> <span>isInvokedByKeyboard</span> <span>=</span> <span>event</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>isEnterKey</span><span>(</span>event<span>)</span> <span>||</span> <span>isSpaceKey</span><span>(</span>event<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>// ...</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>const</span> <span>toggleMenu</span> <span>=</span> <span>event</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>isInvokedByMouse</span><span>(</span>event<span>)</span> <span>||</span> <span>isInvokedByKeyboard</span><span>(</span>event<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    event<span>.</span><span>preventDefault</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>// Do stuff to open the menu...</span></span><br><span>  <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>The <code>isInvokedByMouse</code> was checking whether the <code>click</code> event was invoked by a mouse or touch pointer – rather than a keyboard – by checking if the <code>screenX</code> or <code>screenY</code> coordinates were a positive number.</p><p>That gave us our <strong>final clue:</strong> <mark>the code assumes <code>click</code> events invoked by pointers have positive <code>screenX</code> and <code>screenY</code> coordinate numbers</mark>.</p><p>When a user clicked the 'more' button on a monitor with negative screen coordinates, the event handler wasn't acknowledging the click and instead falling back to the default behaviour of the 'more' button.</p><p>We could finally finish our investigation. We could deduce from our final two clues the solution: <strong>we need to check for negative numbers as well as positive numbers when checking the <code>screenX</code> and <code>screenY</code> coordinates.</strong></p><h2 id="heading-the-fix">The fix<a href="#heading-the-fix"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>As is often the case with bugs, the problem was very complex to figure out, but the solution was very simple.</p><p>All we had to do was change the <code>isInvokedByMouse</code> to check that <code>screenX</code> and <code>screenY</code> don't equal 0, rather than checking if they are greater than 0.</p><pre><code><span><span>const</span> <span>isInvokedByMouse</span> <span>=</span> <span>event</span> <span>=&gt;</span></span><br><span>  event<span>.</span>type <span>===</span> <span>'click'</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>(</span>event<span>.</span>screenX <span>!==</span> <span>0</span> <span>||</span> event<span>.</span>screenY <span>!==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>Now everyone with weird multi-monitor layouts can enjoy the BBC website's navigation bar in peace.</p><p>We should probably do further refactoring of the event handler function, since it's complicated by the fact that it also handles <code>keydown</code> events. For now, though, this fix will do just fine.</p><p>So that was fun! Who would have thought web developers could break an experience for users because of which monitor they're viewing the page on?</p></div></div>]]></description>

            Two undersea internet cables in the Baltic Sea have been suddenly disrupted, according to local telecommunications companies, amid fresh warnings of possible Russian interference with global undersea infrastructure.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm3ndzmfb00083b5vg1ve73t3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            A communications cable between Lithuania and Sweden was cut on Sunday morning around 10:00 a.m. local time, a spokesperson from telecommunications company Telia Lithuania confirmed to CNN.
    </p>

  


    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm3ndzmfb00093b5vrett57s3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The company’s monitoring systems could tell there was a cut due to the traffic disruption, and that the cause was likely physical damage to the cable itself, Telia Lithuania spokesperson Audrius Stasiulaitis told CNN. “We can confirm that the internet traffic disruption was not caused by equipment failure but by physical damage to the fiber optic cable.”
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm3ncci8v00053d5vlue4czn6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Another cable linking Finland and Germany was also disrupted, according to Cinia, the state-controlled Finnish company that runs the link. The C-Lion cable – the only direct connection of its kind between Finland and Central Europe – spans nearly 1,200 kilometers (730 miles), alongside other key pieces of infrastructure, including gas pipelines and power cables.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm3nensrt00173d5v3rduo50c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The area that was disrupted along the Finnish-German cable is roughly 60 to 65 miles away from the Lithuanian-Swedish cable that was cut, a CNN analysis of the undersea routes shows.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm3n1eq4900003b6mraugumu1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            It is unclear what exactly caused the fault in the C-Lion cable – Cinia said in a statement that it is still investigating the issue. A physical inspection has not yet been conducted, Reuters reported citing the company’s chief executive Ari-Jussi Knaapila, who told a press conference on Monday that the sudden outage implied that the cable was cut by an outside force.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm3ncnwqp000b3d5vw1j5p42x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The foreign ministers of Finland and Germany said in a joint <a href="https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/newsroom/news/-/2685132" target="_blank">statement</a> on Monday evening that they were “deeply concerned” about the severed C-Lion cable, and raised the possibility of “hybrid warfare.”
    </p>

            “The fact that such an incident immediately raises suspicions of intentional damage speaks volumes about the volatility of our times. A thorough investigation is underway,” the statement said. “Our European security is not only under threat from Russia‘s war of aggression against Ukraine, but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors.”
    </p>

            The incidents come just weeks after the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/us-sees-increasing-risk-of-russian-sabotage-undersea-cables/index.html">United States warned </a>that it had detected increased Russian military activity around key undersea cables. Two US officials told CNN in September that the US believed Russia was now more likely to carry out potential sabotage operations on these critical pieces of infrastructure.

            The warning came after a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/19/europe/russia-spy-ships-nordic-waters-intl/index.html">joint investigation</a> by the public broadcasters of Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland, which reported in April 2023 that Russia had a fleet of suspected spy ships operating in Nordic waters as part of a program of potential sabotage of underwater cables and wind farms in the region.

            The extent of the disruption caused by Cinia’s C-Lion fault revealed Monday is unclear. The most important data flows are usually routed through several different cables, to avoid overreliance on a single link.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm3n64mhd00003d5vbx7uxuof@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            A repair vessel is ready to go to the site of the fault, Cinia said in a statement Monday evening. It said it did not know how long repairs would take, but added it typically takes between five and 15 days for submarine cables.
    </p>

            Lithuanian state media was first to report the cut between Lithuania and Sweden, and quoted Telia Lithuania’s chief technology officer Andrius Šemeškevičius saying that the cable handled roughly a third of Lithuania’s internet capacity. Capacity has been restored since the disruption.
    </p>

            The cable is operated by Arelion, a Swedish telecommunications company. Martin Sjögren, a spokesperson for the company, confirmed the damage to the BCS East-West link and said that the company is in contact with Sweden’s military and civil authorities about the incident. The cable had connected Gotland, Sweden and Šventoji, Lithuania, he said.

            The issue was detected on Sunday during routine 24/7 monitoring of the company’s network, and the cable is expected to be repaired over the next few weeks, depending on weather conditions, he added.

  <p>"It is an existential crisis," he said.&nbsp;</p><h2>Holding the outside world at bay&nbsp;</h2><p><span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/when-morley-safer-visited-a-fairy-tale-kingdom/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Bhutan</a></span>, which is about the size of Maryland, was largely isolated from the rest of the world for centuries. The kingdom was so protective of its unique Buddhist culture that it only started allowing foreign tourists to visit in the 1970s and didn't introduce television until 1999.&nbsp;</p>

    

<p>Buddhism is the country's national religion. Bhutanese, especially older men and women, spend hours spinning prayer wheels full of Buddhist scriptures. Prayer flags flutter on hillsides and in forests, turning nature itself into a shrine.&nbsp;</p><p>Bhutan's capital city of Thimpu still has no traffic lights.

<p>Bhutanese wear different clothes and construct buildings in a traditional architectural style. The culture remains strong today.&nbsp;</p><p>"We came to realize that, you know, that what we had in the past, what is old, is actually very valuable," Dorji said.&nbsp;</p><p>Bhutan was, and is today, largely a subsistence agricultural society. Many families still live in multigenerational farmhouses.&nbsp;</p><p>The country was unified by the man who became its first king in 1907. His sons and grandsons — who are referred to in Bhutan as the second, third, fourth and today, fifth, kings — have reigned since.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bhutan's unique path to modernity&nbsp;</h2><p>It was Bhutan's fourth king who, as a young, newly-crowned ruler in the 1970s, set Bhutan onto its path toward modernity. Jigme Singye Wangchuck, on his way home from a summit of nonaligned nations in Cuba, landed at an airport in India, where journalists asked him what Bhutan's gross national product was.&nbsp;</p><p>"And the king said, 'Actually, in Bhutan, gross national happiness is much more important to us than gross national product,'" Dorji recounted.&nbsp;</p><p>The phrase stuck and attracted international attention. Maximizing Gross National Happiness became a primary responsibility of Bhutan's government, led today by Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay.&nbsp;</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/727e4435-f3d3-4a51-809e-3cf4e292c734/thumbnail/620x349/8f087cf03f1f013345d8d653f7746036/tshering-tobgay.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898#" alt="Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay " height="349" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/727e4435-f3d3-4a51-809e-3cf4e292c734/thumbnail/620x349/8f087cf03f1f013345d8d653f7746036/tshering-tobgay.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 1x, https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/727e4435-f3d3-4a51-809e-3cf4e292c734/thumbnail/1240x698/79d51679c662135e7f143e3f82dc1a2a/tshering-tobgay.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E"></span>

              </figcaption></figure><p>"Gross National Happiness acknowledges that economic growth is important, but that growth must be sustainable. It must… be balanced by the preservation of our unique culture," Tobgay said. "People matter. Our happiness, our well-being matters. Everything should serve that."</p>

    
    

<p>Every five years, surveyors fan out across Bhutan measuring the nation's happiness. The results are analyzed and factored into public policy.&nbsp;</p><p>"Gross National Happiness does not directly equate to happiness in the moment. One happiness is fleeting, it is emotion, it is joy," Tobgay said.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ancient-traditions-of-bhutan-60-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Experiencing Bhutan's ancient and wondrous traditions</a></li></ul><p>The other — the kind Bhutan is focused on, Tobgay said — is contentment, being happy with life and oneself.&nbsp;</p><p>It's also about nature. By law, at least 60% of the country must remain under forest cover. And with most of its energy coming from hydroelectric power, Bhutan was the first and remains today one of the only countries in the world to be carbon negative.&nbsp;</p><p>It earns foreign revenue selling excess hydropower to India and from tourism, but there are limits. The country is full of gorgeous mountains, but summiting mountain peaks isn't allowed.&nbsp;</p><p>"For a Bhutanese, it's very easy to understand: You know, the mountains are sacred," Dorji said.&nbsp;</p><p>School is taught in English and it's free, as is health care.&nbsp;</p>

    
    

<p>And though the country has a king, Bhutan is also a democracy.&nbsp;</p><h2>Introducing Bhutan to democracy</h2><p>A quarter century after introducing Gross National Happiness, the fourth king decided the best thing for his country would be to have an elected parliament and a prime minister.&nbsp;</p><p>"[It's] the only country where<span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bhutans-reluctant-road-to-democracy/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""> democracy was introduced</a></span> in a time of peace and stability, where democracy was literally gifted, imposed on the people, not just gifted, because the people didn't want it," Tobgay said.&nbsp;</p><p>As a reporter, Dorji covered the king's travels throughout Bhutan as he held meetings called consultations to discuss the idea with his subjects. Dorji remembers people begging the king not to institute a democracy.&nbsp;</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/b2cae4c3-688f-43f7-8e18-40853ca5c714/thumbnail/620x349/59c32fa71bd725415ffa8d50e8c1daf9/bhutan-king.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898#" alt="Bhutan's king with Lesley Stahl " height="349" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/b2cae4c3-688f-43f7-8e18-40853ca5c714/thumbnail/620x349/59c32fa71bd725415ffa8d50e8c1daf9/bhutan-king.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 1x, https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/b2cae4c3-688f-43f7-8e18-40853ca5c714/thumbnail/1240x698/4f57142cc6e241bc794c077fd92af141/bhutan-king.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E"></span>

              </figcaption></figure><p>"Because when they looked around the world, their horizon was India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan: Democracy," Dorji said. "Which is really synonymous with violence, with corruption. So they said, 'No, thank you. We don't really need that. We are fine.'"</p><p>The king was not swayed by their arguments, arguing in response that a leader chosen by birth and not by merit might one day lead the country to disaster. Then, at just 51, he abdicated and passed the crown to his 26-year-old son, the fifth and current king. Bhutanese headed to the polls for the first time ever in 2008.</p><p>Today the fifth king is 44. He is adored in the country and works closely with the prime minister.&nbsp;</p>

    
    

<h2>So why are young Bhutanese leaving the country in record numbers?</h2><p>Bhutan is currently facing what is known in the country as a crisis of outmigration. The COVID-19 pandemic hit Bhutan's economy hard, shutting down tourism. Recovery has been slow.&nbsp;</p><p>Many Bhutanese, with their excellent English, found higher-paying jobs in Australia, even doing menial labor. Word of opportunities spread fast on social media and now a devastating 9% of the country's population, most of them young people, have left.&nbsp;</p><p>"This is a very difficult situation for Bhutan," Tobgay said.&nbsp;</p><h2>Luring people back with a City of Mindfulness&nbsp;</h2><p>Bhutan's government has mobilized, with the king launching a bold, high-stakes plan to lure people back. Prime Minister Tobgay is trying to attract more business and tourists to Bhutan, highlighting landmarks like a centuries-old suspension bridge, part of an ancient 250-mile trail from one end of the country to the other that is now open to trekking tourists.&nbsp;</p><p>But tourism can only do so much and Bhutan's king knows it, so he has decided to create a new city in southern Bhutan with different rules from the rest of the country. It will be an attempt at a new model of robust economic development, while still holding true to Bhutanese values.&nbsp;</p><p>The king is calling it the Gelephu Mindfulness City.&nbsp;</p><p>He turned to Danish architect <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-architect-bjarke-ingels-billion-dollar-designs/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Bjarke Ingels</a></span> to design it. The new city will have neighborhoods nestled between the area's many rivers, connected by a series of unusual bridges. The bridges will also act as public buildings, with one home to a Buddhist center, another to health care facilities and yet another a university. There won't be any skyscrapers, and everything will be built with local materials.&nbsp;</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/83e9902a-0af2-4703-ba66-aa05a79e22fa/thumbnail/620x349/37163192d257b344a8547e5e1f3fd5b4/bjarke-ingels.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898#" alt="Danish architect Bjarke Ingels " height="349" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/83e9902a-0af2-4703-ba66-aa05a79e22fa/thumbnail/620x349/37163192d257b344a8547e5e1f3fd5b4/bjarke-ingels.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 1x, https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/83e9902a-0af2-4703-ba66-aa05a79e22fa/thumbnail/1240x698/39653bcb18ca41cea483029b47028571/bjarke-ingels.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E"></span>

              </figcaption></figure><p>Right now, the area — located in Bhutan's lowlands — is largely undeveloped. Dr. Lotay Tshering, a former prime minister whom the king has tapped to lead the new city, said it will be built in phases over the next two decades, with no polluting industries allowed.&nbsp;</p>

    
    

<p>The area is also home to a lot of wildlife, including elephants. The new city will have wildlife corridors to protect the animals.&nbsp;</p><p>The king has said the success of the project will shape the future of Bhutan.&nbsp;</p><p>"When we say we follow the principles of Gross National Happiness, we do not mean we are happy with less… We also want to be rich. We also want to be technologically high standard," Dr. Tshering said. "We want Bhutanese to be heading multi-million dollar companies, multinational companies."</p><p>A Bhutanese team is collaborating with experts around the world, seeking investors to help build the city, the cost of which is likely to run in the billions. The city will have its own legal framework modeled on Singapore's and will run on clean hydroelectric power, with the hope of drawing technology companies, especially AI.</p><h2>Deciding to stay</h2><p>Ingels presented his plans to the king, and the king then presented them to the nation, last December.&nbsp;</p><p>Namgay Zam, a journalist who used to anchor Bhutan's nightly newscast, was in attendance. She'd been in the middle of planning a move to Australia with her family when she went to hear the king that day at a packed stadium.</p><p>"He did what no king had done before. He asked the people to help him directly. And he said, 'Will you help me?' And there was shocked silence," Zam said. "Even for me, I froze. And I was like, 'Did he just ask us to help him?' And then he said, 'Will you help me,' a second time."</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/e84f401b-809e-4d11-9999-78b317954be7/thumbnail/620x349/7c2e479d49acdca1e85261eee9a228f6/namgay-zam.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898#" alt="Namgay Zam " height="349" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/e84f401b-809e-4d11-9999-78b317954be7/thumbnail/620x349/7c2e479d49acdca1e85261eee9a228f6/namgay-zam.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 1x, https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/e84f401b-809e-4d11-9999-78b317954be7/thumbnail/1240x698/67661abb73cbb1500e9f4defac53f065/namgay-zam.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E"></span>

And I said, 'I've signed a social contract with his majesty, because I said yes.'"</p><p>Zam and her husband did not go to Australia, but the king and his family did. He visited the country last month to bring his vision for the new Gelephu Mindfulness City and the future of Bhutan to packed stadiums of more than 20,000 Bhutanese who live in Australia now, all in the hopes of one day luring them back home.&nbsp;</p><p>"If we succeed, we can show that you can create a city that does not displace nature, that is anchored and rooted in the local heritage and culture, and that still allows for growth and prosperity to happen," Ingels said. "That is a struggle a lot of places in the world are struggling with."</p>

<h2>Also known as: why you shouldn’t trust a company who makes their product intensionally inaccessible with allowing you an accessibility workaround</h2>



<p>Update: I’ve been informed that hCaptcha now has a text captcha option. The bulk of this blog post still stands. Thanks to D Hamlin for the correction. Also thanks to T Spivey for pointing out my capitalization error causing eloquence users to just hear captcha. This has also been fixed. It’s been a while, hasn’t it? Well I’m back again with a long overdue blog post. Once again, it’s a warning of something crazy. Seems I’m good at coming up with blog posts for those lol. Anyway, let’s get on with it</p>



<p>I’m sure you’ve seen the hCaptcha captcha service, where you check a box and then need to select all images of a house or whatever. If you’re not aware, they intensionally do not provide an audio captcha version for the blind since they say this would make it easier for bots to get through. Instead, they provide a special account for blind people that allows them to get a cookie which lets them get past the captcha without a challenge…</p>



<p>This should be warning sign umber one. If they’re intensionally making their captcha inaccessible, then why should you trust them with an accessibility workaround. What happens when they decide that the accessibility workaround is causing too much of a headache? What happens when bots start using it to get past the captcha for free? We’ll be partially discussing that today, though in a slightly different context.</p>



<p>Anyway, I mainly use brave browser for my browsing needs, and for about a year, my accessibility account just wouldn’t set the cookie on brave. I followed all the steps, third party cookies were allowed, etc, but the cookie just would not set. It worked great on firefox, chromium, and everything else I tried. The message just said that if this keeps occurring that I should email support. So finally I did email support.</p>



<p>They walked me through basic troubleshooting steps, most of which I had already tried, and in an attempt to isolate the problem and help out their technical staff, I mentioned that the call to their set cookie endpoint seemed to be returning a 401 unauthorized code in brave, looking at the javascript console. This, I think, made them a little suspicious, even though I was only trying to help them out.</p>



<p>So imagine my surprise, when out of nowhere in the middle of my conversation with a support rep named Gemma, another rep named Mel sends a reply and says</p>



<pre>Hello,
                                                                                                                                
This is not a supported use, and you are not being credited for accessibility passes.
                                                                                                                                
All accounts being used in this way will be deleted from hCaptcha, and the users banned if they attempt to sign up again for
accessibility.
                                                                                                                                
Thanks,
hCaptcha Support
</pre>



<p>I was obviously very confused, as I wasn’t doing anything they didn’t allow, I was just trying to get it working under brave. So I emailed back, and they clarified that since I wasn’t blind, I shouldn’t be using the accessibility account.</p>



<p>Excuse me? I’m not blind? Are you serious?</p>



<p>I have no idea what got that idea through their heads, but I verified that my account had indeed been banned. I emailed back a day or so later, requesting an unban because, y’know, I *actually* am blind, but they gave a pretty canned response of no, your account is remaining banned.</p>



<p>So the end result is that, irony of all ironies, if I want to get past hCaptcha, I have to break their terms of service and use an automated solving program to solve the captcha, all because they decided, randomly, that I wasn’t blind, so can’t use their accessibility account.</p>



<p>Consider this a warning that, if you rely on a workaround to an intensionally inaccessible system to make it useable, you’re just waiting for something to go wrong.</p>



<p>I can’t stress this enough. Don’t trust a company that makes their product intensionally inaccessible to provide an accessibility work around. That’s like a zebra trusting a lion who eats zebras to not eat them out of the kindness of their heart. It’s a ticking timebomb.</p>



<p>Please share this post with your friends, and if you know any webmasters who use hCaptcha, consider forwarding this to them. It’s not ok what they’re doing, and it’s affecting real people. I was going to reach out to Cloudflare to share my experience in an attempt to get them to drop hCaptcha, but apparently they’re using an in house system now anyway. Good riddance, I say.</p>



<p>Anyway, consider this a warning, and maybe I won’t wait 5 years before my next blog post! Lol.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large language models have demonstrated substantial advancements in reasoning capabilities, particularly through inference-time scaling, as illustrated by models such as OpenAI's o1. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-o1, a novel VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-o1 independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-o1 to achieve marked improvements in precision on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we compile the LLaVA-o1-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose an inference-time stage-level beam search method, which enables effective inference-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and a simple yet effective inference time scaling method, LLaVA-o1 not only outperforms its base model by 8.9% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
  I've packaged this article up and released a library, <a href="https://maxbo.me/celine">@celine/celine</a>. It has a slightly nicer API too. Check it out! (o˘◡˘o)
</p><div>

<div><p>

Before I start, why am I doing this?
</p><p>

<b>I don't think HTML is being used enough as a platform for scientific publishing.</b></p><p>

Instead, people will:
</p><ol>
  <li>Use an interactive notebook like <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>, <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-10.html">RStudio</a>, <a href="https://plutojl.org/">Pluto.jl</a> or <a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a> to do data exploration, analysis and visualisation,</li>
  <li>Move to a publishing platform like <a href="https://typst.app/">Typst</a>, <a href="https://overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>, pure <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>, or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editor to typeset their work,</li>
  <li>Export to <code>.pdf</code> for distribution.</li>
</ol>
<p>
I think a HTML file can be used for all 3 of these stages, and prevent a lot of faffing around with manual processes, CLI tooling, CI steps and 3rd-party platforms.
</p><p>

HTML's typesetting capabilities are well documented, but its capabilities as a platform for data exploration, analysis and visualisation are not.
</p>
<p>
I'll try and demonstrate these capabilities, literate programming style.
</p><p><img src="https://maxbo.me/img/document.png" alt="A computer displays an open book">
</p>

</div>



<p>

We also want <code>contenteditable</code> <code>script</code>s to be re-evaluated on blur by building a clone of the <code>script</code> and then removing the original.
<br>



</p>



<div><p>

Now we'll declare a cell called <code>counter</code> that emits a number every second.
<b>The <code>script</code>'s <code>id</code> attribute is the same as the <code>name</code> parameter passed to <code>cell</code></b>.

</p><p>


<i>Try changing the initial counter value <code>i</code> above to a much bigger number, and then defocus the <code>script</code>.</i></p></div>
<p>

Now that we've created a our <code>counter</code> cell, we can create other cells that depend on it.

<br>

We'll import <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/htl">Hypertext Literal</a> and use it to format the
<code>counter</code> value. <code>htl</code> implements a full-blown HTML5 parser that performs automatic escaping and 
interpolation of non-serializable values, such as event listeners, style objects, and other DOM nodes.



</p>


<p>
We can still observe the output of a cell without needing to show its definition. Just don't add the <code>echo</code> class. 
This makes them useful as a rendering primitive.


<i>(There's a hidden cell above ^)</i>

</p>

<p>

Alternatively, we can create a cell type that doesn't display its output at all.
<br>
We can use these cells to store intermediate values or datastructures.




Also note that cells can be declared out of order.





</p>



<p>

We can use cell values in more complex outputs. We'll import <a href="https://observablehq.com/plot/what-is-plot">Observable Plot</a> and use the <code>counter</code> value in a plot.



</p>

<p><img src="https://maxbo.me/img/up.png" alt="A computer displays a graph in the upward direction">
</p>

<div>

<h2>TeX, Markdown, Graphviz</h2><p>

We can return any type of DOM element from a cell. 
<br>
In this case, the <code>tex</code>, <code>md</code>, and <code>dot</code> cells return <code>span</code>, <code>table</code> and <code>svg</code> elements respectively.
</p><p>

<i>Try editing any of the following cells.</i></p></div>




<!-- <div class="slide">

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.13.18/dist/katex.min.css">
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/wypst@0.0.8/dist/wypst.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
  
<script type="module" class="echo" id="typst" contenteditable="true">
cell("typst", [], async () => {
  const div = document.createElement("div");
  await wypst.initialize()
  wypst.render("sum_(k=1)^n k = (n(n+1)) / 2", div);
  return div
});
</script> -->

<p><img src="https://maxbo.me/img/data.png" alt="A computer with an open CD tray is surrounded by data">
</p>

<div>

<h2>Cell status</h2><p>

We can also return a <code>Promise</code>, or throw an <code>Error</code>, from a cell.

Observable's <code>Inspector</code> will apply an <code>observablehq--running</code> or
<code>observablehq--error</code> class to the cell's outer <code>div</code> element respectively.
We'll style them appropriately:



</p></div>


<div>
<h2>Python</h2><p>

The <a href="http://pyodide.org/">Pyodide</a> CPython WASM distribution includes <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a>, <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/">scikit-learn</a>, and <a href="https://scipy.org/">Scipy</a>.
We'll rebuild the plot seen above, but using Matplotlib and Python's <code>sqlite3</code> module instead.

</p><p>

<i>Try editing one of the plot labels!</i></p></div>
<div>
<h2>R</h2><p>

You know the drill. It's R, using <a href="https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/">WebR</a>. 
I didn't figure out how to get <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a> <a href="https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/plotting.html">rendering</a> working, but I assume it's possible.

<i>I must disclose that this cell seems to be a bit flaky on iOS. I have not had a chance to investigate further, nor will I.</i>



</p></div>
<div>

<h2>Inputs</h2><p>

We'll create a new cell type <code>viewof</code> that works specifically with <a href="https://github.com/observablehq/inputs">Observable Inputs</a>.

It declares 2 reactive cells: <code>NAME</code> and <code>viewof NAME</code> - one for the value, and one for the DOM element itself.



</p></div>
<div><p>

To display the input above the cell, we set the cell <code>id</code> to <code>viewof NAME</code>.
</p><p>

<i>Wiggle the range input and see another dependent cell update.</i></p>




<p><i>NB: The way Observable Inputs work is a bit arcane. This demo of <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/synchronized-inputs">Synchronized Inputs</a> may shed some light.</i>

</p></div>
<div>

<h2>Mutability</h2><p>

Purely functional dataflow is great, but sometimes you just need to mutate state.
We'll create a new helper function <code>mutable</code>. It registers a <code>Mutable</code> - an object that yields new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator"><code>Generator</code></a> values when the value is mutated - in the runtime.



</p></div>
<p><i>Try editing the initial state of the <code>mutable</code>.</i>



<i>Try editing the button labels.</i>





</p>


<!-- <h2>3D models</h2>

We can use Google's <a href="https://modelviewer.dev/"><code>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</code></a> <a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction">Web Component</a> to display 3D models.

<script type="module" class="echo" id="model">
import 'https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/model-viewer/3.5.0/model-viewer.min.js';

cell("model", async () => {
  return htl.html`
    <model-viewer 
      style="width: 100%; height: 400px"
      src="/models/NeilArmstrong.glb"

      shadow-intensity="1" 
      camera-controls 
      touch-action="pan-y">
  </model-viewer>
  `;
});
</script> -->

<!-- <div class="slide"> -->

<!-- <h2>Saving contenteditable changes</h2>

Taking a note out of <a href="https://cristobal.space/">Cristóbal Sciutto</a>'s <a href="https://cristobal.space/note">Self-modifying HTML notes</a>,
it's very easy to save a modified version of our document to disk. -->

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<article>
		<div class="page">
			
			
			<p>I have come to believe that by and large “best practices” are doing more harm
than good. Not necessarily because they’re bad advice as such, but because
they’re mostly pounded by either 1) various types of zealots, idiots, and
assholes who abuse these kind of “best practices” as an argument from authority,
or 2) inexperienced programmers who lack the ability to judge the applicability,</p>

<p>Everyone else just says “X is better because Y”. This is an actual argument that
can be engaged with, and engaging with actual arguments is what discovers the
best solution for the situation at hand.</p>

<p>This is not unique to programming; even the best of ideas becomes silly once you
start uncritically applying it to everything – one can find many examples in
politics. There, too, it’s mostly pounded by various types of zealots, idiots,
and assholes.</p>

<hr>

<p>All of this doesn’t mean that “best practice” are bad advice. Many are worth
reading, and some should always be followed. But many are little more “this
thing someone said” and/or “just someone’s opinion”.</p>

<p>Take Postel’s “law” – what if I break this “law”? Will the police come and
arrest me? Will I get the Nobel prize in physics as I’ve discovered new laws of
nature? It’s not a “law” in any meaningful sense: it’s just a thing this Postel
guy said in 1980, which may or may not be applicable to whatever you’re doing.</p>

<p><em>Postel’s quip</em> was probably good advice in 1980 in the context of TCP. There
were tons of little incompatibilities between existing implementations and
Postel was working on the first effort to actually standardize it all. Back then
it was typically harder to write fully correct implementations (no internet with
tons of examples, little to no testing, less access to other implementations,
etc.)</p>

<p>There are other cases where it’s the reasonable and practical thing to do. But
as a general concept applied to all protocols or all software development I find
it’s mostly a bad idea. I’m hardly the first to critique it, and it’s been
controversial for decades.</p>

<p>In spite of that, people citing <em>Postel’s quip</em> as if it’s somehow a “law” are
still plentiful. My law is that everyone who does so is an idiot, asshole, or
some combination of both.</p>

<p>There are many more examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“Don’t use globals” is obviously good, but “never use globals under any
circumstances” is just silly. I’ve seen people throw a hissy fit over
“globals” in simple CLI tools with a few functions. Whoop-dee-doo.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Don’t use unstructured GOTO” has turned into “never use goto”, “don’t use
continue because it’s like a hidden goto”, and “use single point of exit”, and
that kind of absolute insane bollocks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Don’t Repeat Yourself” (DRY) is basically good advice, but sometimes just
copy/pasting things is just the more pragmatic thing to do, and not really a
big deal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think “12 factor app” has some okay ideas, some dubious ideas, and some
outright bad ideas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the basic ideas of “SOLID” are okay, I generally find that strong
adherence does not lead to particularly good code. It’s typically 80% fucking
about with <em>how</em> to do things, and 20% actually doing the stuff you want to do
(which makes things harder to understand and change, not easier).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>etc. etc. etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can disagree with any of the above, and that’s fine. But citing “laws” or
“best practices” are just a fallacious arguments from authority.</p>

<hr>

<p>One of the difficulties with argueing against “best practices” is that it often
goes something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>“X is not according to best practices”</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>“I think X is better because Y”</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>“But it’s not following best practice Z! Here is a book about it! Why don’t
you follow it?! Do you want to write bad code?!”</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There is kind of a gaslighting effect here, because it’s very natural to assume
that maybe you <em>should</em> be following the “best practice”, especially when
declared with great arrogance.</p>

<p>This is the same fallacious argument people use for safety:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>“I don’t X will improve safety.”</em></p>
  </li>
  <li><em>“What?! You don’t care about safety?!”</em></li>
  <li>or: <em>“Better safe than sorry!”</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Which is why safety regulation only grows and never shrinks, even when the
regulation just makes no sense eat all: arguing against it is hard, because the
look of things is against you. I call this the <em>Safety Fallacy</em>.</p>

Closed-source CAD is taught in schools and is deeply entrenched in established industry use. We knew that to be successful, we would have to find a way to provide real value and coexist in environments where other tools are already used.</p><p>While seeking a scalable and repeatable business model, we conducted numerous surveys and interviewed nearly a hundred mechanical engineers, service engineers, tinkerers, inventors, workshop owners, and other users. While we found support among independent and hobbyist users who genuinely wanted us to succeed, we failed to find commercial adoption to justify a venture-capitalized startup. Ultimately, we could not find a product-market fit and ran out of runway to continue the search.</p><h2 id="things-we-are-proud-of">Things we are proud of<a href="#things-we-are-proud-of" aria-label="Direct link to Things we are proud of" title="Direct link to Things we are proud of">​</a></h2><p>While we have failed to build a sustainable commercial business around FreeCAD, we have accomplished many things.</p><h3 id="a-better-freecad-application">A better FreeCAD application<a href="#a-better-freecad-application" aria-label="Direct link to A better FreeCAD application" title="Direct link to A better FreeCAD application">​</a></h3><ul><li>We contributed a new integrated assembly workbench that was sorely missing in the program and a 3D constraints solver on which the workbench relies.</li><li>We also contributed significant improvements to the usability of Sketcher and TechDraw.</li><li>We introduced VarSets — a brand-new custom properties system.</li><li>We introduced new features to TechDraw and CAM workbenches.</li><li>Beyond FreeCAD itself, we contributed to third-party addons like SheetMetal.</li></ul><h3 id="lens-as-a-service-for-connected-cad">Lens as a service for connected CAD<a href="#lens-as-a-service-for-connected-cad" aria-label="Direct link to Lens as a service for connected CAD" title="Direct link to Lens as a service for connected CAD">​</a></h3><ul><li>We demonstrated what a connected CAD experience could look like with open source at its core.</li><li>We built a service that enabled teams to organize iterated development of hardware products.</li><li>We built a simple way to share your models publicly or privately, including PIN protection for share links.</li><li>We made it possible to publish parametric models online that you can modify and download.</li></ul><p>Between our May release (2024.2) and today alone, 145 pull requests by the Ondsel team have been merged into the upstream codebase, making FreeCAD 1.0 a more featureful and polished release than we all hoped it would be.</p><p>Having a commercial partner working on FreeCAD also meant that the project had to adapt. Our presence and cooperation affected how the FreeCAD project operates. Our blog brought attention to missing features and helped the project establish priorities. Working with the core maintainers, we improved the contribution process, sped up the merge process, and helped form the Design Working Group and the new CAD Advisory Group. These are significant advances that will benefit the community for a long time.  </p><p>Most of all, we showed that a commercial partner can be an asset to the project.

We owe much of the praise for the UI to Joe Sardos, who designed OpenTheme. We didn’t fund that project, but we pushed it on our users, and they loved it. So we think Joe did a spectacular job, and we cannot thank him enough for that. </p><p>The added value we shipped as part of OES is all available as free and open-source code, and most of it will be part of FreeCAD.</p><p>As such, there is no point in releasing v2024.3.

Brad will continue hacking in the CAM workbench, Pierre will likely continue working on Assembly and Sketcher, and Pieter will keep working on varsets and variant parts thanks to grants issued by the FreeCAD Project Association. All future contributions to FreeCAD by our former team members will now go directly to the upstream project.</p><p>We have yet to submit a few improvements to FreeCAD, namely the reloadable objects feature, which we strongly believe should be a core feature.

<p>If you hear the term "black company", what kind of company do you imagine? As we all know, black is the darkest color, so if you pictured an evil company with a dark side then you would be on the right track. A black company (aka "black corporation" or "black business") is <i>buraku kigyō</i> <ruby>ブラック<rp>（</rp><rt></rt><rp>）</rp></ruby><i></i> <ruby>企業<rp>（</rp><rt>きぎょう</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby> in Japanese. In general, it is a term used to refer to an unacceptably exploitative employment system.</p>

<p>Now, maybe you're thinking this is a word to describe a factory somewhere in China, but you'd be wrong. The term is actually usually associated with white-collar industries rather than blue-collar ones. It was coined by young IT workers in the early 2000's and, being the IT workers that they were, spread this nickname around the internet as an internet meme. Now, thanks to its fame, it is a term that can be used for other industries that are not IT.</p>

<h2 id="the-black-company-and-a-film">The Black Company And A Film</h2>

<p>As the popularity of the term grew, the black company problem received more and more attention in Japan. In 2009, a drama film called "A man on the verge at a BLACK company" was released. It was based on an office worker who started a 2ch thread about the black company he worked at. This company's ruthless and unethical work environment was duplicated in the film.</p>

<p>As you can see in the film clip, the workers are being pushed to their limit and obviously not in good shape. Can you imagine working someplace like that for real? Well, bad (black) companies are really out there and this sparked a move towards calling them out. Still, there was a long way to go to bring about public awareness.</p>

<h2 id="the-black-company-awards">The Black Company Awards</h2>

<figure><img alt="A skyscraper housing a Japanese Black Company" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japan/2014-04-25-japanese-black-companies/black-company-building.jpg"><figcaption>  </figcaption> Source: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sharif/3299531471" title="Visit source's website" target="_blank">Beshef</a></figure>

<p>In 2012, a group of people that included journalists, activists, and university professors formed a special committee to create the "Black Corporations Award" where the public could vote on "the most evil corporations of the year." The award name may sound silly, but its creators were not joking. They were hoping to raise awareness of black company issues as well as expose some of the evil abusers of employees. This is now an annual award.</p>

<figure><img alt="Graphic with Japanese text saying Most Evil Corporation Award" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japan/2014-04-25-japanese-black-companies/most-evil-corporation-award.jpg"></figure>

<p>The most recent award, which took place on June 17th of 2013, nominated eight companies:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Watami Foodservice Co., Ltd (Restaurant Chain)</li>
  <li>Cross Company Inc. (Clothing Retailer)</li>
  <li>Benesse Corporation (Education and Publishing)</li>
  <li>Sun Challenge Corporation (Steak Restaurant Chain)</li>
  <li>Ohsho Food Service Corporation (Restaurant Chain)</li>
  <li>Seino Transportation Co., Ltd (Transportation Service)</li>
  <li>Tokyu Hands Inc. (Department Store)</li>
  <li>Tohoku University</li>
</ol>

<p>All nominations were made on the following basis:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Actual public records on occupational problems such as a long work time, sexual harassment, or abuse of power.</li>
  <li>Long intense work hours.</li>
  <li>Low pay.</li>
  <li>Compliance violations.</li>
  <li>Flaws in the system, such as lack of childcare leave or maternity leave.</li>
  <li>Hostility to unions.</li>
  <li>Discrimination against temporary workers.</li>
  <li>Temporary worker dependance.</li>
  <li>npaid overtime (and lies about paid overtime in the job advertisements).</li>
</ol>

<p>Most black companies already have the above problems, so the nominees were chosen for being especially bad. After the nominations, there was a period in which people could vote. The winner? Watami Foodservice Co., and by a wide margin. They got 21,899 votes, 72% of the total. This was followed by Tohoku University (3,475 votes), Benesse Corporation (1,258 votes), Cross Company Inc (1,220 votes), Seino Transportation Co., Ltd (1,000 votes), Ohsho Food Service Corporation (744 votes), Sun Challenge Corporation (649 votes), and Tokyu Hands Inc (346 votes). Watami has won this award for two years in a row so far.</p>

<p>Watami's winning streak is due to its notoriously abysmal mistreatment of young workers. In 2008, Mina Mori, a female employee of Watami, committed suicide at the age of 26 after reportedly working 141 hours of overtime in one month. It happened just two months after joining the restaurant chain. Some people may think committing suicide is an individual matter and that a company cannot be held responsible. However, it is reasonable to assume Mori would not have chosen suicide for herself had she not been forced into such a desperate situation. Furthermore, it is apparent just how "black" the Watami company is simply by the cold reaction of Watami founder Miki Watanabe's reaction to the case. He not only refused to meet with her family but also refused to apologize to them until last month. He finally did offer an apology in court on March 27, 2014, though he still has denied liability.</p>

<p>According to an interview with a former Watami restaurant manager conducted by Takarajima magazine (September 2013 edition), upon hearing the news of Ms. Mori's suicide, the ex-manager wondered if it was really <em>just</em> 141 hours. During his time at Watami, he regularly worked from 7am to 12am with almost no break, making his monthly overtime over 300 hours. He also revealed that Miki Watanabe gives extreme messages to workers on every payday, such as: "Regret as hard as you die!" He even received a personal letter from the evil president in his paycheck envelope saying: "you should reflect on your sales this month by killing yourself."</p>

<figure><img alt="The exterior of a Watami Bar during the evening" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japan/2014-04-25-japanese-black-companies/watami-bar-at-night.jpg"><figcaption>  </figcaption> Source: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/miyo/2473313816" title="Visit source's website" target="_blank">Miyo Sekimoto</a></figure>

<p>There was also an illegal but mandatory 1,000 yen deduction from every payment and workers were told that it was for "social contribution." When Watanabe published his own book, the price of the book was automatically deducted from the payment and workers were forced to buy them as well. Although there wasn't any physical violence, he remembered that there was much verbal violence, often relating to "killing himself."</p>

<p>That sounds pretty awful, right? These workers were not treated like human beings… more like robots. Though even robots shouldn't have to work this hard. Obviously a lot of other people felt the same way and anti-Watami movements have risen. On the same day that Watami apologized to Ms. Mori's family, Watami decided to temporarily close 60 restaurants (about 10% of the total) to improve their work environment. I hope this will really be the start of some reform so that others won't have to endure the same mistreatment.</p>

<p>Perhaps thanks to this and the awareness brought about by the Black Company Awards, the term <i>buraku kigyō</i> <ruby>ブラック<rp>（</rp><rt></rt><rp>）</rp></ruby><i></i> <ruby>企業<rp>（</rp><rt>きぎょう</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby> made the final 10 of the most popular or influential Japanese buzzwords in 2013! So, consider the checkbox of "raising awareness" filled in, though there's still much work to be done.</p>

<h2 id="what-colors-a-company-black">What Colors A Company Black?</h2>

<figure><img alt="Black paint chipping off a wall" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japan/2014-04-25-japanese-black-companies/black-wall.jpg"><figcaption>  </figcaption> Source: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dg_pics/3938829378" title="Visit source's website" target="_blank">David Gunter</a></figure>

<p>So what are the exact qualifications for a company to be considered a black company? You can get some idea from the stories of Watami, but a lawyer named Yoshiyuki Iwasa, who is also the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/o/ASIN/4907292090/itmedia-makoto-22/">ブラック<i></i> <ruby>企業<rp>（</rp><rt>きぎょう</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>に<i></i> <ruby>倍返<rp>（</rp><rt>きぎょう</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>しだ!</a> (which means "to take double revenge on the black company") <a href="http://bizmakoto.jp/makoto/articles/1401/23/news018_2.html">created a checklist for a website called Business Media</a> to find out whether the company is "black" or "not black." There are thirty items on the list and if none of them apply to the company, it is pure white. If 1-9 items are applicable, it is considered gray. 10-14 is dark gray. 30 out of 30 is pitch black. You get the picture. Now let's take a look at the list.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I do work overtime, but overtime is never paid.</li>
  <li>It's usual to work more than 80 hours overtime a month.</li>
  <li>I don't have a break, or at the most, 10 minutes a day.</li>
  <li>I work on my days off. Actually, I'm not even sure when my days off are.</li>
  <li>There is no paid time off system or if there is such a system, I am never allowed to use it.</li>
  <li>I never get reimbursed for expenses and always have to pay out of pocket.</li>
  <li>There is no social insurance, benefits, or pension. If I ask about this, I would be bullied.</li>
  <li>If I converted my monthly wage into an hourly rate equivalent, it would be less than minimum wage.</li>
  <li>Regardless of how long I work overtime, the overtime payment is a fixed amount.</li>
  <li>The company is constantly hiring new employees.</li>
  <li>The advertised job wage is different from the actual amount paid.</li>
  <li>There are no time cards or someone else punches you in and out.</li>
  <li>There are one or more workers who can't come to the office due to psychotic depression or nervous breakdown.</li>
  <li>I'm so busy that I often can't get adequate sleep.</li>
  <li>There is no union or company regulations.</li>
  <li>Some employees are promoted to an administrative position right after joining the company, but there is no extra remuneration for that.</li>
  <li>Employees have to run private errands for their employers.</li>
  <li>There is a slogan saying "work until you die" on the company wall.</li>
  <li>Abuse of power and sexual harassment are very common.</li>
  <li>There are so many affiliate companies and subsidiaries, though I don't even know what those companies do.</li>
  <li>Whenever some incident happens, the company changes its name.</li>
  <li>There are training sessions, which use what can be considered brainwashing or hazing.</li>
  <li>Threats such as "I'm going to kill you" can be commonly heard at the office.</li>
  <li>Violence is rampant.</li>
  <li>All the supervisors are relatives of the CEO.</li>
  <li>I was told to quit the company in a roundabout way like, "you may not be cut out for this position."</li>
  <li>I can't quit the job. If I say I'm going to quit, I'll be threatened that I will have to pay damages for quitting.</li>
  <li>They don't provide the necessary documents such as the separation slip to those who try to quit.</li>
  <li>The worker's average age is really young.</li>
  <li>The rate of people leaving their jobs within 3 years is really high.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now after looking through them, do any of these conditions apply to your company? Many of the items may sound ridiculous, but I have worked under some of these conditions before and I have some friends who work for such companies. However, I'm not sure if their companies are pitch black. Maybe just very, very dark?</p>

<figure><img alt="Black paint trailing down a white wall" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japan/2014-04-25-japanese-black-companies/dripping-black-paint.jpg"><figcaption>  </figcaption> Source: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rockandbacon/4600142725" title="Visit source's website" target="_blank">rockandbacon</a></figure>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/houdou/2r985200000339uj.html">Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare</a>, the number of cases delivered to the General Labor Consultation Center in 2012 was 1,067,210. 254,719 of them involved troubles at work such as encouragement of early retirement, worsening work conditions, the lowering of pay, long periods of overtime without payment, or mean, abusive bosses and/or coworkers. A decade ago, only around 100,000 cases were reported. This number has increased about 2.5x, showing that either black companies are increasing in number, or, what is more likely, more people are coming forward. These companies are finally having their true colors exposed (black).</p>

<p>In September, 2013, the Labor Ministry began a crackdown on black companies, too. They examined 5,111 such companies based on their high turnover rates of young workers, their past violations, and complaints from employees. Then it was revealed that over 80% of them, 4,189 companies, were indeed actually black companies engaged in illegal business practices. They were flagged for violations against the Labor Standards Act. The ministry intends to discipline the companies in question and if those companies continue to violate the Labor Standards laws, their names will be made public.</p>

<p>So, now that the Labor Ministry is getting involved, can we call this the end of the story? Well, I'm afraid it's not over yet. This was only the ministry's first survey on black companies and there are over 4 million companies in Japan. So, the exciting fight has only just begun! We're counting on you, Black Company Awards and Japan's Labor Ministry!</p>
