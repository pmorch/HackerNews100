<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-dtm-region="articulo_cuerpo"><p>Four of the main retail groups in the United States — including the country’s and the world’s largest, Walmart — have highlighted in their respective second-quarter earnings presentations the complexities their businesses face due to <a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-07-14/trump-sows-confusion-and-some-indifference-with-his-tariff-swings.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-07-14/trump-sows-confusion-and-some-indifference-with-his-tariff-swings.html">tariffs imposed by the Trump administration</a>. These tariffs have been the main topic of discussion for Walmart, Home Depot, Target, and Lowe’s — listed retailers that are already feeling, to a greater or lesser extent, the effects of this trade policy.</p><p>As for results, the impacts have been cushioned by the companies’ swift reaction, which involved applying various price increases, as well as activating efforts to achieve greater cost efficiencies. As Walmart’s president and CEO Doug McMillon acknowledged: “We’ve continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue into the third and fourth quarters.” Target’s CEO, Brian Cornell, echoed this sentiment: “The straight cost impact of tariffs will be with us as long as the tariffs are with us.”</p><p>All eyes were on Walmart. The global retail giant had already warned, in its first-quarter earnings release, that it could not absorb all the cost pressures resulting from tariffs, given the company’s — and the industry’s — thin margins. Even U.S. President Donald Trump pressured the company to absorb those expenses against its margins.</p><p>“We’re doing what we said we would do,” Doug McMillon explained last week. “We’re keeping our prices as low as we can, for as long as we can,” he added, reflecting the constant pressure on costs that continue to rise. “As we replenish inventory at post-tariff price levels, we’ve continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue into the third and fourth quarters.” </p><h3>Protecting margins</h3><p>According to its financial disclosures, Walmart has acted surgically on its pricing to protect its margins. The group increased its revenues in the first half of the year by 3.7%, compared with a 3.6% increase in procurement costs, allowing it to hold steady and even gain a tenth of a point in gross margin. The same pattern is seen in the second quarter alone: sales grew by 4.75%, while costs rose by 4.7%.</p><p>“We’re focused on the customer, kind of the fundamentals of the business, whether it’s pricing or inventory management,” McMillan explained. On the latter point, tariffs are also making themselves felt. In Walmart’s case, inventory value rose in the first half of the year by $2.1 billion, up 3.7% from a year earlier, “due to <a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-07-15/trumps-tariffs-are-starting-to-hit-consumers-wallets-inflation-climbs-to-27-in-june.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-07-15/trumps-tariffs-are-starting-to-hit-consumers-wallets-inflation-climbs-to-27-in-june.html">higher import costs.</a>”</p><p>The retail giant clarified that most of its purchases are made in the U.S., while one-third come from abroad — mainly China, Mexico, Vietnam, India, and Canada. In the case of China, it is facing the looming threat of a 145% tariff, up from the current 30%.</p><p>Diversification of import sources is now a key concern for U.S. retailers. “Our teams have done an incredible job partnering with our vendors to diversify product sourcing,” Home Depot’s executive vice president, Billy Bastek, said last week. “We will continue to work with our vendors to ensure that we have the right products at the right value in stock.” He specified that 50% of its merchandise is not subject to tariffs since it is sourced within the U.S.</p><p>Home Depot — the world’s largest home improvement retailer — acknowledges that there will be “modest price movements for some categories” because current tariffs “are significantly higher than last quarter,” according to Bastek. He also announced a reduction in promotional activity for part of its offerings.</p><p>Like Walmart, Home Depot has fine-tuned its pricing strategy, especially in the second quarter. During that period, its revenues grew 4.86%, while procurement expenses increased 4.84% — enough to support its margin.</p><h3>Exposure to foreign markets</h3><p>Two other major U.S. retailers are more exposed to <a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-06-08/luxury-isnt-what-it-used-to-be-whats-happening-to-the-worlds-most-exclusive-brands.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-06-08/luxury-isnt-what-it-used-to-be-whats-happening-to-the-worlds-most-exclusive-brands.html">high levels of imports</a>. Lowe’s — which also specializing in home improvement products — sources 60% of its merchandise outside the U.S., with 20% coming from China. “It wasn’t that way seven years ago,” said Lowe’s chairman and CEO, Marvin R. Ellison, last week. “We have done, in my estimation, an excellent job of working cross functionally relative to looking for diversification.”</p><p>Like the rest of the sector, Lowe’s is also applying price increases with a category-specific approach. “Specific to pricing, we said [...] we would be pricing competitive [...] That’s what we’re continuing to do,” said Ellison. “Prices in retail will always be dynamic. Your prices will fluctuate up and down through various categories based on competitive responses, internal algorithms.” The company’s sales rose 1.6%, while procurement costs increased by 1% — another case of protecting margins.</p><p>Target, meanwhile, acknowledged that, “as one of the largest importers in the country, the prospect of higher tariffs meant we were facing some major financial and operational hurdles,” said Cornell, who will step down as CEO next year. The company’s trajectory is further complicated by “multiple changes in tariff policy that have been announced and implemented as the year has progressed,” he added.</p><p>For this reason, the supermarket chain has adopted various mitigation strategies, including “diversifying” production and sourcing countries. “We have many levers to use in mitigating the impact of tariffs, and price is the very last resort,” said Target executive vice president, Rick Gomez, last week.</p><p>The company — one of the benchmarks in traditional retail — has posted declining sales for three consecutive years, a trend that continued into the first half of this year. Sales fell 1.9% in that period, though the decline eased to 0.9% in the second quarter. Its inventory rose 2%, “reflecting higher product costs than a year ago, driven by tariffs and other pressures.”</p><p>Of the four companies analyzed, Target was the only one whose gross margin worsened in the second quarter. It declined by one percentage point, after merchandise costs increased 0.5% while sales fell 0.9%. The company expects to complete its recovery in 2026.</p><p><i>Sign up for </i><a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en" rel="" title="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"><i>our weekly newsletter</i></a><i> to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition</i></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="Box">



<p>MacOS has shipped with a collection of “utility” apps since the prehistoric era of classic Mac OS. A good rule of thumb what makes an app a “utility” is that it’s a tool for doing something <em>about</em> your computer. Ever since Mac OS X 10.0, most of these apps have been neatly filed away in <em>/Applications/Utilities/</em>. Others — some because they’re obscure (e.g. Ticket Viewer), some because they’re effectively deprecated (e.g. DVD Player, whose copyright date in MacOS 15 Sequoia is 2019), and some because they present themselves, when launched, not as apps but as system-level features (e.g. About This Mac) — are tucked away in <em>/System/Library/CoreServices/</em> or <em>/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@BasicAppleGuy/115089810537348465">Basic Apple Guy posted a screenshot to Mastodon</a> comparing the current MacOS 15 icons for four of these utilities (Disk Utility, Expansion Slot Utility, Wireless Diagnostics, and AppleScript Utility) to their new icons in MacOS 26 Tahoe, beta 7 (click to enlarge for detail):</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/tahoe-utility-icons-via-basic-apple-guy.jpeg">
  <img src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/tahoe-utility-icons-via-basic-apple-guy.jpeg" alt="Screenshots of the MacOS 15 and MacOS 26 (beta 7) icons for Disk Utility, Expansion Slot Utility, Wireless Diagnostics, and AppleScript Utility." width="500"></a></p>

<p>I don’t think the old icons for these apps from MacOS 15 were particularly good — Apple has mostly lost its “icons look cool” game. But the new ones in MacOS 26 Tahoe are objectively terrible. The only one of this bunch that’s maybe sort of OK is Wireless Diagnostics. They all look like placeholder icons made by a developer who would be the first to admit that they’re not an artist. Disk Utility, which is an important app, doesn’t even look like it involves a disk. That icon just says “Fix something Apple related.” On an Apple computer, that could mean anything.</p>

<p>These new icons all use the same “wrench” motif, which is a lazy, limiting concept to start with. Tahoe, at the system level, enforces a squircle shape on all application icons. Apps that haven’t been updated with Tahoe-compliant everything-fits-in-a-squircle icons are put in “<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/08/08/macos-tahoe-fix-gray-box-icons/">squircle jail</a>” — their non-Tahoe-compliant icons are shrunk and placed atop a drab gray Tahoe squircle background, to force them into squircle compliance. But these Apple utility apps have an entire sub-motif — inside their base squircle shape is a large wrench fitted against a bolt. Only inside the bolt — which is inside the wrench’s forks, which wrench is inside the squircle — goes the part of the icon that identifies app itself. So maybe like 10 percent of the area of the icon is the area where the app can show something that identifies its purpose.</p>

<p>So the entire concept for these icons sucks. But the conceptual execution sucks too. The wrench is incredibly stupid-looking. Whoever drew it has obviously never used a crescent wrench because the forks on the wrench head are <em>way</em> too thin. They’d break off under any significant torque. Just look at a photo of real-life wrench, or — just look at the wrenches in the older MacOS icons.</p>

<p>Individually the icons mostly suck too:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Disk Utility — a very important app — has an icon that’s just an Apple logo (inside the bolt that’s inside the wrench that’s inside the squircle). Not a hard drive, not an external drive, not an SD card. Just an Apple logo. If I just showed you this icon without telling you which app it represented, how in the world would you guess what it is? Even if you know the “Apple utility app icon” motif of the big dumb wrench and bolt, the best you could guess is “a utility app for something Apple-related” which, for an Apple computer, could be anything.</p></li>
<li><p>Expansion Slot Utility — This app only runs on Mac Pros because Mac Pros are the only Macs with expansion slots. So the old icon naturally shows a Mac Pro. The new icon shows ... three rectangular empty sockets?</p></li>
<li><p>AppleScript Utility — A fine concept for this icon (within the confines of the terrible wrench-and-bolt utility icon concept). Everyone who knows AppleScript knows the scroll that represents AppleScript scripts. So just put the iconic AppleScript scroll in the bolt in the wrench in the squircle. But here, the placement of the scroll is botched — it’s rotated a few degrees counterclockwise. It makes the scroll look like it’s falling over. Here’s how the scroll is canonically oriented, via the glyphs in SF Symbols:</p>

<p><img src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/applescript-icons-sf-symbols.png" alt="The “applescript” and “applescript.fill” icon glyphs from the SF Symbols font."></p>

<p>and via the default icon for a script application (with a line added showing the center):</p>

<p><img src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/macos-15-script-application-icon.png" alt="The default application for an AppleScript “script application”, with a vertical orange line showing the center." width="440"></p>

<p>But here’s a close-up of the Tahoe AppleScript Utility icon, with a center line added:</p>

<p><img src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/tahoe-applescript-utility-icon-drunk.png" alt="Close-up of the MacOS 26 Tahoe icon for AppleScript Utility, with a center line added to show that the script “scroll” is tilted incorrectly."></p>

<p>It’s wrong. From Apple, of all companies.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are the not the work of carpenters <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/445621-when-you-re-a-carpenter-making-a-beautiful-chest-of-drawers">who care about the backs of the cabinets</a> they’re building. These icons are so bad, they look like the work of untrained “How hard can it be?” dilettante carpenters who only last a few days on the job before sawing off one of their own fingers. The whole collection looks like the work from someone with no artistic ability <em>nor</em> an eye for detail. From <em>Apple</em>, of all companies.</p>

<p>Is it a big deal in the grand scheme of things that the icons for these seldom-used utility apps have gone to shit? No. But consider the proverbial canary in a coal mine. The problem isn’t that one little bird has died. The problem is that the bird might be dead because the whole mine is filling with deadly carbon monoxide or highly flammable methane gas. The icons in <em>/Applications/Utilities/</em> in MacOS 26 Tahoe represent a folder full of dead canaries. </p>

One of the best examples of the power of this technology is Blacksky, which began as a custom feed and has always been a collective effort between myself, close collaborators, and the broader Black userbase.

We codify our rules in an internal SOP document after we reach consensus.</span></p><p>Our moderation tech stack currently consists of a few things:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation" rel="">Ozone</a><span>: We self-host an instance of this open source software, where our mods can label and tag posts, and take down accounts on our PDS (where user data is stored), and email accounts</span></p></li><li><p>rsky-labeler: An automated labeler service that scans every post, username, and profile that’s created or updated to identify anti-Black slurs and alert our team for manual review</p></li><li><p>Alerting system: A queue-based email alert (normal report, post showing in Blacksky feed, etc.)</p></li><li><p>“Ban From TV”: A feature that prevents known abusers from being able to view the Blacksky feeds at all</p></li><li><p>The “Green List”: AT Protocol allows us to create and share block lists, which users can subscribe to and automatically block bad actors on the list, like those harassing Black users</p></li><li><p><a href="http://github.com/blacksky-algorithms/SAFEskies" rel="">SAFEskies</a><span> app: Our way of allowing moderators to reorder and remove posts from the feed(s) without seeking admin approval, giving them more agency and control over the Blacksky algorithm.</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://docs.blackskyweb.xyz/docs" rel="">Documentation</a><span>: A site with user-friendly descriptions of Blacksky’s infrastructure</span></p></li></ul><p><span>In the early days of Bluesky, Black users felt they were being pushed off. Blacksky became a platform for Black users to feel heard and seen. To create Blacksky, we wrote our own implementation of AT Protocol (called </span><a href="https://github.com/blacksky-algorithms/rsky" rel="">“rsky”</a><span> and pronounced “risky”). An underlying premise of Blacksky’s rsky is to not only “seize the means of production,” as well as the distribution, but to also act as a “dual power” structure.</span></p><p><strong>Blacksky’s rsky guarantees our community a seat at the table, and ensures that we can leave and easily make our own table if we need to</strong><span>. That’s the true promise of decentralized social media.</span></p><p>Clearly I think that decentralization is great, not only for the problems it prevents, but also the new possibilities it creates. But if everyone’s running their own servers, apps, and moderation teams, how do we do global social media? That’s where our vibrant open source developer community comes in.</p><p><span>Blacksky runs our own global relay at </span><a href="https://atproto.africa/" rel="">https://atproto.africa</a><span>, which we built from scratch. Every day, our relay stores its own copy of the hundreds of gigabytes of data of all known AT Protocol accounts — 36 million and counting. We also developed what we call our “moderation relay,” which lets us know about all of the moderation decisions ever made by all mod teams globally.</span></p><p>This helps us combine efforts with other community moderators, keeping our feeds free of things like transphobia or unwanted sexual content, in addition to anti-Blackness.</p><p>We do this because it ensures the independence of Blacksky, and it builds in some redundancy that makes the whole AT Protocol ecosystem more resilient overall and less reliant on the company running Bluesky. Otherwise, the whole ATmosphere could end up becoming too similar to a centralized app with an API, like a client app connected to Instagram.</p><p><span>Because of our relay, you can create a post on Bluesky, using a Bluesky hosted account, and it will be able to show up in the Blacksky feed, on the Blacksky Community app. For network governance purposes, it’s important to the future of the ecosystem that other independent organizations create and maintain global services like this.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Google is tightening security measures around Android app distribution, the company announced on Monday. Starting next year, Google will begin to verify the identities of developers distributing their apps on Android devices, not just those who distribute via the Play Store. The changes will affect all <a href="https://www.android.com/certified/partners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">certified Android devices</a> once live, though the global rollout will be more gradual.</p>

<p>The tech giant stresses that this does not mean developers can’t distribute outside of the Play Store through other app stores or via sideloading — Android will remain open in that regard. However, developers who appreciated the anonymity of alternative distribution methods will no longer have that option. Google says this will help to cut down on bad actors who hide their identity to distribute malware, commit financial fraud, or steal users’ personal data. </p>







<p>According to its own survey, Google says that more than 50 times more malware came through internet-sideloaded sources compared with Google Play, where it has required developer verification since 2023.</p>

<p>Initially, Google will allow interested developers to sign up for early access starting in October 2025 to test the system and provide feedback. In March 2026, verification will go live for all developers. By September 2026, any app installed on an Android device in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand will have to meet the new requirements. Starting in 2027, the requirements will begin rolling out globally.</p>

<p>Developers will have to provide their legal name, address, email, and phone number, which could push independent developers to register as a business for their own privacy’s sake. Apple implemented a similar change for the EU App Store earlier this year to comply with the&nbsp;<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Digital Services Act</a>&nbsp;(DSA), a regulation that now requires app developers to provide their “trader status” to submit new apps or app updates for distribution.</p>

<p>Google notes that student and hobbyist developers will be able to use a separate type of Android Developer Console account when this system rolls out, as their needs differ from commercial developers.</p>

<p>The changes could have a significant impact on the Android app ecosystem and app distribution, as Google works to cut down on the security issues and malware that have typically plagued its platform. </p>

<p>To combat malware and financial scams, Google announced today that only apps from developers that have undergone verification can be installed on certified Android devices starting in 2026.</p>



<p>This requirement applies to “certified Android devices” that have Play Protect and are preloaded with Google apps. The Play Store implemented similar requirements <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/11/09/google-play-more-app-testing/">in 2023</a>, but Google is now mandating this for all install methods, including third-party app stores and sideloading where you download an APK file from a third-party source.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Think of it like an ID check at the airport, which confirms a traveler’s identity but is separate from the security screening of their bags; we will be confirming who the developer is, not reviewing the content of their app or where it came from.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Google wants to combat “convincing fake apps” and make it harder for repeat “malicious actors to quickly distribute another harmful app after we take the first one down.” A recent analysis by the company found that there are “over 50 times more malware from internet-sideloaded sources than on apps available through Google Play.”</p>



<p>Google is explicit today about how “developers will have the same freedom to distribute their apps directly to users through sideloading or to use any app store they prefer.”</p>	
	



<p>This new requirement sees Google create a new Android Developer Console for those that only distribute outside of Google Play. Students and hobbyists will get a separate workflow that differs from commercial developers.&nbsp;</p>




	<p>Those that distribute via Google Play “likely already met these verification requirements through the existing Play Console process,” with a <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/07/boosting-trust-and-transparency-in-google-play.html">D-U-N-S</a> number for organizations needed.</p>



<p>The first Android app developers will get access to verification this October, with the process opening to all in March 2026.</p>



<p>The requirement will go into effect in September 2026 for users in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. Google notes how these countries have been “specifically impacted by these forms of fraudulent app scams.” Verification will then apply globally from 2027 onwards.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At this point, any app installed on a certified Android device in these regions must be registered by a verified developer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Google notes “supportive initial feedback” from government authorities and other parties:</p>



<hr>



<ul>
<li>…with Indonesia’s Ministry of Communications and Digital Affairs praising it for providing a “balanced approach” that protects users while keeping Android open.</li>



<li>…Thailand’s Ministry of Digital Economy and Society sees it as a “positive and proactive measure” that aligns with their national digital safety policies.</li>



<li>In Brazil, the Brazilian Federation of Banks (FEBRABAN) sees it as a “significant advancement in protecting users and encouraging accountability.”</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
        <p>Recently, Socket.dev published <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/60-malicious-ruby-gems-used-in-targeted-credential-theft-campaign">research</a> highlighting malicious gems
designed to steal social media credentials. We wanted to use this as an
opportunity to share more about how RubyGems.org security operates, how
we proactively handled this incident (and others), and the work our team
is doing each day to keep the ecosystem safe.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-detect-malicious-gems">How We Detect Malicious Gems</h2>

<p><strong>RubyGems.org security uses a proactive and multi-layered approach:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Automated detection:</strong> Every gem upload is analyzed using both
static and dynamic code analysis, including behavioral checks and
metadata review. Much of this capability comes from Mend.io’s
supply chain security tooling (originally built by our own Maciej
Mensfeld, a maintainer on the RubyGems team).</p>

<p><strong>2. Risk scoring:</strong> Each package is given a score. Higher-risk gems
are escalated for manual review by a member of our security team.</p>

<p><strong>3. Retroactive scanning:</strong> As detection techniques improve, older
packages are automatically rescanned, which allows us to catch
threats that may have slipped through in the past. (This is how we
found the threat actor that Socket.dev later investigated.)</p>

<p><strong>4. External sources:</strong> We sometimes receive alerts from vulnerability
databases, industry partners, and cross-registry collaborations,
which help us identify patterns across ecosystems.</p>

<p>Through steps 1 - 3, our team detects the majority (roughly 70-80%) of
malicious packages before they are ever reported to us or the public.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-when-we-flag-a-gem">What Happens When We Flag a Gem</h2>

<p><strong>Once a gem is flagged, we:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Verify:</strong> A RubyGems security engineer reviews the code to confirm
malicious intent (about 95% of flagged packages prove to be
legitimate).</p>

<p><strong>2. Double-check:</strong> When there’s any doubt, we seek a second opinion
within the team.</p>

<p><strong>3. Remove:</strong> Confirmed malicious gems are removed via a standardized
process in our admin panel.</p>

<p><strong>4. Document:</strong> Every action is logged with reasoning for
traceability.</p>

<p><strong>5. Protect further:</strong> In some cases, we preemptively block suspicious
gem names (for example, ones mimicking company internals) to
prevent possible abuse.</p>

<h2 id="this-incident">This Incident</h2>

<p><strong>This is the timeline of the actions our team took concerning the
incident reported by Socket.dev:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>July 20, 2025 –</strong> Our systems flagged suspicious gems, and the
team confirmed malicious credential-stealing behavior. We would
like to specifically credit RubyGems maintainer Maciej Mensfeld
for this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>July 23–28 –</strong> We removed nearly all of the affected packages
and terminated the associated accounts. We would like to
acknowledge again Maciej Mensfeld for his security work here, as
well as Josef Šimánek, who provided a second opinion and helped
with package removal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>August 7 –</strong> Socket.dev published their report and notified us of
16 additional gems from related accounts, which we also removed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In total, we removed all malicious packages from this threat actor,
including two not covered in the original report.</p>

<p>Socket.dev has also <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/follow-up-on-malicious-ruby-gems-campaign">published an updated accounting</a> of this incident
after talking directly with our team and clarifying key details about
our response.</p>

<p><strong>It’s also important to note:</strong> this campaign involved a small number
of gems. Widely used and trusted packages were not affected.</p>



<p>We welcome and encourage researchers and community members to work with
us by reporting issues through these channels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Email:</strong> You can also reach us at
<a href="mailto:security@rubygems.org">security@rubygems.org</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Slack:</strong> Join the <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/bundler/shared_invite/zt-1rrsuuv3m-OmXKWQf8K6iSla4~F1DBjQ">Bundler
Slack</a>
to connect with the RubyGems.org team and community of committers
and developers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once we receive reports, we acknowledge them, review them quickly, and
follow up with the person who made the report. We are grateful for every
contribution that helps keep RubyGems and the Ruby ecosystem secure.</p>

<h2 id="the-reality-of-supply-chain-security">The Reality of Supply Chain Security</h2>

<p>RubyGems.org is smaller than ecosystems like
<a href="https://github.com/npm">npm</a> but malicious activity is
still a serious threat. On average, we remove about one malicious or
spam package per week, though that number can spike higher.</p>

<p>This work is resource-intensive. Most of our efforts are currently
supported by sponsors, including <a href="http://mend.io/">Mend.io</a>
and <a href="https://alpha-omega.dev/">Alpha-Omega</a>, but a
significant portion of time comes from contributions by volunteer
maintainers. Many of these maintainers have personally dedicated over a
decade to this critical work, driven by their passion and commitment to
keeping the Ruby ecosystem secure.</p>

<p><strong>If your company depends on RubyGems.org, consider supporting its
maintenance and security directly through our <a href="https://rubycentral.org/news/rubygems-org-funding-model-a-new-path-for-community-led-growth/">RubyGems Supporter
Program</a>.</strong>
Community funding enables us to continue to invest in the people,
infrastructure, and security work that keep RubyGems safe and keep
RubyGems.org a community-led service.</p>

<h2 id="in-closing">In Closing</h2>

<p><strong>This recent incident shows our security systems working as intended:</strong>
threats were detected, removed, and contained before they could cause
widespread harm.</p>

<p>Security in open source will always be a shared effort. We want to thank
Socket.dev for their research, as well as the broader community for
continuing to report issues.</p>

<p>You are welcome to reach out to us through the above channels if you
have any additional questions.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>Liquid cooling is a familiar concept to PC enthusiasts, and has a long history in enterprise compute as well. Recently, liquid cooling has taken an increasing role in datacenters, amid increasing power draw and correspondingly high heat output from the latest chips. Machine learning in particular has an insatiable appetite for power and cooling. Google notes that water has a thermal conductivity about 4000 times that of air, making it an attractive solution to deal with the cooling demands associated with the current AI boom. Their talk at Hot Chips 2025 focuses on datacenter-level cooling for their TPUs, which are machine learning accelerators.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nH5V!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nH5V!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nH5V!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nH5V!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nH5V!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nH5V!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png" width="1456" height="777" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:777,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1567453,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/171824794?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nH5V!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nH5V!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nH5V!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nH5V!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F175b8f8a-00fb-48e0-a742-dd90e1a5937a_1574x840.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Google’s foray into liquid cooled TPUs took form in 2018 after some experimentation and iteration. The company has continued to develop and advance their cooling designs since. Their current liquid cooling solution is designed for datacenter scale, with liquid cooling loops spanning racks rather than being contained within servers. Racks of six CDUs, or Coolant Distribution Units, perform a role analogous to the radiator+pump combo in an enthusiast water cooling loop. The CDUs use flexible hoses and quick disconnect couplings to ease maintenance and reduce tolerance requirements. A CDU rack can provide adequate cooling capacity with five CDUs active, allowing maintenance on one unit without downtime.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png" width="1456" height="828" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:828,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1064929,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/171824794?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe40da4f9-3950-472f-95f5-fa2f2f85fa39_1543x877.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>CDUs exchange heat between coolant liquid and the facility-level water supply.

To further optimize cooling, Google employs another techniques with parallels in the enthusiast world. TPUv4 switches to a bare-die setup compared to TPUv3’s lidded one. That mirrors delidding in the enthusiast world, where PC builders with especially strong stomachs remove heatspreaders (lids) to gain the higher heat transfer efficiency that bare die cooling can provide. For Google’s part, TPUv4 needs such an approach because it has 1.6x higher power draw compared to TPUv3.</p><p>Beyond moving heat off chips, liquid cooling helps reduce cooling-related power requirements. Google found the power consumption of liquid cooling pumps was less than 5% of fan power associated with an air cooling solution. Because Google uses water-to-water heat transfer to get heat off the coolant, the bulk of cooling power comes from pumps. Enthusiast setups don’t realize this potential advantage because they use liquid to move heat from chips to a more optimal location for air cooling. Usually, that’s a radiator with a fan mounted at a case intake. In theory, a PC builder could try exchanging heat to a toilet tank, allowing for highly efficient cooling with each flush. But fan and pump power in a water cooled PC is quite low in absolute terms, especially compared to the high RPM fans typically found in a server. Thus there’s little reason for an enthusiast to tackle cooling-related power.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png" width="1456" height="872" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:872,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1216356,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/171824794?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-5OK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f95e9b7-e5f8-4547-90ba-bb142202262f_2180x1306.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Finally, maintenance is a concern. PC enthusiasts are familiar with water cooling challenges like microbial growth and leak risk. The same concerns apply to datacenter-scale water cooling solutions. Both worlds share some mitigating measures, like quick disconnect fittings. But datacenters have to address those challenges without taking down a substantial portion of compute capacity. PC builders with an open loop have to power down their machine before draining the loop and replacing components. Google’s extra CDU, mentioned earlier, allows maintenance with zero downtime. But Google takes measures beyond that, because a small problem with one machine can translate to a maintenance nightmare at scale.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png" width="1456" height="725" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/aab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:725,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:572413,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/171824794?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zY4p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faab3b4a5-1dc9-4eea-b316-c43952bd7879_2311x1150.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Google extensively validates components with leak testing, uses alerting systems to discover problems like leaks, and takes preventative measures like scheduled maintenance and filtration.

Both worlds are driven to liquid cooling by its incredibly efficiency when moving heat. Both must contend with similar problems. But datacenter approahces diverge from there, and driven by scale and reliability requirements. Plenty of water cooling hardware is already visible on the first day of Hot Chips 2025. Nvidia has a GB300 server on display, with external water cooling connections clearly visible.

									<!-- タイトル end -->

				<!-- 日付 start -->
				<p>August 25, 2025</p>

				<!-- 内容 start -->
				<p>On July 30, 2025, the U.S. government issued an executive order titled “Termination of De Minimis Treatment for All Countries” regarding mail to the United States.</p>

				<p>Under this executive order, starting August 29, 2025, mail containing goods imported for personal use (taxable mail) will no longer be eligible for duty-free treatment, and tariffs will be imposed. On August 15, 2025, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced new guidelines regarding the elimination of de minimis rules, which require that transport operators pay customs deposits to CBP and prepare customs declarations. The procedures that transport operators and postal operators in each country must follow to comply with these guidelines are not clear, however, making implementation difficult.</p>

				<p>Therefore, starting August 27 (Wed.), in line with other national postal operators, we will temporarily suspend the acceptance of postal items (small packets, parcels, and EMS (goods)) to the United States that contain the following items:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Individual gifts with a content value exceeding 100 US dollars</li>
					<li>Goods intended for sale for consumption</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In addition, we will continue to accept letters, postcards, printed matter, EMS (documents), and postal items (small packets, parcels, and EMS (goods)) containing gifts between individuals with a value of less than US$100.</p>

				<p>As an alternative to the above suspension of acceptance, our international courier service, UGX (U-Global Express), can handle shipments in compliance with U.S. customs regulations:</p>

				<p><a href="https://www.post.japanpost.jp/int/UGX/index_en.html">UGX (U-Global Express)</a></p>

				<p>We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><hr><p>Over the past couple of years I’ve been experimenting with MiniPCs, and the more I do, the more I’m convinced this is
the future I want to invest in.</p><h2 id="the-many-advantages-of-minipcs">The Many Advantages Of MiniPCs
<a href="#the-many-advantages-of-minipcs">#</a></h2><p>Before I ramble on about how great something I like is, first let me assure you that I know they’re not perfect either,
and might not be what some people want.
Nevertheless, here are my own reasons and explanations for how I came to be swayed in this direction, why I think it’s a
good idea, and why I would recommend this to others.</p><h3 id="cheap-and-replaceable">Cheap and Replaceable
<a href="#cheap-and-replaceable">#</a></h3><p>MiniPCs are all-in-one, factory built, shipped as-is products.
The converged supply chain and economy of scale usually leads to MiniPCs being cheap, or at least with very high bang
per buck all things considered.</p><p>However, because of these same reasons, they are usually not repairable, and theoretically produce more E-waste.
I don’t worry about this too much: they are fully solid state machines, running on low power and low-ish temperatures,
thus making their rate of degradation much slower than some beefy machine churning 24/7.</p><h3 id="small-and-compact">Small and Compact
<a href="#small-and-compact">#</a></h3><p>It’s called mini because it is.
These adorable devices don’t take up space, and in a pinch, are portable as well!
If you need lots of computers around the house, this is the way to go.</p><p>Need a living room HTPC to browse the internet and such on a big screen at social gatherings?
Get a MiniPC and chuck it behind the TV.
No one will even notice it.</p><p>Have a small desk nook where you do some light work?
Connect the monitor, mouse, and keyboard to a MiniPC.
It looks like a dock, but it’s actually the entire computer!</p><h3 id="power-efficiency">Power Efficiency
<a href="#power-efficiency">#</a></h3><p>Most MiniPCs are based on low-voltage hardware.
The power draw can vary in peak usage based on how beefy it is, but they are the kings of idle power consumption.
You can expect average power draws of 20-50W in usage and 6-12W in idle.</p><p>Put that in perspective with high-end machines with hardware concerned with performance and not power draw, that can
easily idle at 100W.</p><p>Things that need to run 24/7 but aren’t actually in use 24/7 are great beneficiaries of running on MiniPCs.
And in the long run, your electricity bill will be lowered using several MiniPCs versus a big bad box.
If the actual price doesn’t seem that much to you, at least take solace in knowing you’re going greener and consume
less.
If that’s not important either, then you’re hard to please, aren’t you?</p><p>How about we allow ourselves to ponder a little on the not so distant future?
The current hardware is generally still <code>x86_64</code>, but in future we’ll have ARM, or dare I dream, RISC-V?
We’ll get less power consumption for the same level of compute or more compute for the same level of power consumption.
Ok, Apple already has this with the M4s, and that’s exactly my point, look how well it works!
And there’s also a handful ARM based boards out there, it’s just a matter of time till they reach general availability.</p><h3 id="versatile-through-specializations">Versatile Through Specializations
<a href="#versatile-through-specializations">#</a></h3><p>You cannot use a MiniPC do to everything, but everything you need to do can be done by a MiniPC.
By mixing and matching different types of MiniPCs, you can cover all your computing needs!</p><ul><li><p><strong>General Compute</strong>:
The first one you think of, run-of-the-mill MiniPCs are usually just this, laptop-grade hardware in custom PCBs in a
different form factor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Networking</strong>:
You can find MiniPCs with 4-6 ethernet ports too, making them an ideal platform to run custom firewalls, routers, or
simply a personal VPN connected 24/7 to your network.
They are more powerful and smaller than your average routers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network Storage</strong>:
You can get MiniPCs with 4-6 internal M.2 slots that are great for building a NAS with.
That is, of course, if you don’t need mass storage <em>(≤20TB)</em>, and you don’t mind the higher cost per GB of flash
storage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Personal Cloud</strong>:
Take a beefy general compute MiniPC, install Linux on it, and make it a convenient container hoster.
Storage? What for? We can keep that on the NAS. We just do compute here.
If you’re demanding and want resiliency too, why not get multiple computers and build a mini cluster?</p></li><li><p><strong>Dammit Apple</strong>:
If you’re like me and want your main station to be Linux, but also have apps and other use-cases that require macOS,
good news, Apple makes MiniPCs too, and quite powerful ones at that.</p></li></ul><h3 id="monoliths-are-hard-to-build">Monoliths Are Hard To Build
<a href="#monoliths-are-hard-to-build">#</a></h3><p>Let’s imagine you want to build a homelab with the first four use-cases mentioned above.
You will need a motherboard with good I/O, an extra decent network card, a case with many drive bays for storage, lots
of RAM for ZFS, and the services you run, along with a CPU with enough PCI lanes and cores to keep up with all that.</p><p>Usually for this, consumer components don’t offer <em>exactly</em> what you need.
You might find yourself scouring the web for weird deals on Amazon or second hand markets.
Suppose you find everything, but they don’t ship at the same time.
Suppose you made a mistake, and you need to return something but because you had to wait to find out about the
incompatibility, you’re out of the return grace period.</p><p>Okay, maybe that’s a little too contrived of an example, but the point I’m making is generally good hardware for a
single desktop to handle everything is hard to come by, and also not very lenient towards you having an easy time.</p><p>And I’m fairly certain you will get the same utility for a lower or equal price, with much less manual work needed, if
you shop for a few MiniPCs instead.</p><h3 id="no-need-for-virtualization">No Need For Virtualization
<a href="#no-need-for-virtualization">#</a></h3><p>Virtualization is amazing and useful, but also annoying.
That is not to say MiniPCs can’t do it, in fact they make a good Proxmox host.
But if you use MiniPCs you don’t <em>need</em> to use VMs in the first place.</p><p>For the NAS + Personal Services example, let us imagine we were on a monolith PC with TrueNAS on bare metal, and we
would like a VM for the media PC connected to a nearby TV, and one container to run Jellyfin.
We want them both hardware-accelerated, and we have two GPUs, great so… <em>WHOOPS!</em>
We can’t pass both of them because TrueNAS insists on keeping one for the host, and it’s really a pain to circumvent.</p><p>If instead we had a MiniPC being just a NAS, one being just a service host, and one being just an operating system for
the TV, we wouldn’t need to even make any of these considerations.
Everything is already compartmentalized.</p><p>In a sense, <em>you</em> become the virtualization host.
Do you need another VM? Buy a MiniPC and add it to the network.</p><h3 id="avoiding-single-points-of-failure">Avoiding Single Points of Failure
<a href="#avoiding-single-points-of-failure">#</a></h3><p>Imagine the next conversation when a friend comes to visit.</p><p>— Hey dude, I’m trying to use the bathroom but the light switch isn’t working.</p><p>— Remember last week we were watching that movie on my living room PC thing?
Well actually, the PSU just died couple days ago, I’m waiting for a replacement.</p><p>— That’s unfortunate, but what’s the connection?</p><p>— Oh yeah, my bad, those are smart home bullshit. The switch doesn’t actually go anywhere it sends messages to my
HomeAssistant, which then is supposed to tell the bulbs to turn on.</p><p>— Home what? Oh…, cool I guess? So why ain’t it working?</p><p>— That used to run on the PC, so while that’s down I can’t use it.</p><p>— So you mean to tell me you’ve been using your torch to take a shit this last week because your light bulbs don’t work
without the PC you watch Netflix on?</p><p>— Yep… uh… <em>yep</em>. I guess in hindsight I would’ve done it differently.</p><p>There’s a reason why people recommend getting a separate Raspberry Pi for that!
Hardware failures are unpredictable and unavoidable.
But at least you should try and minimize the inconvenience such events bring.</p><h3 id="less-stressful-fun-to-tinker">Less Stressful, Fun To Tinker
<a href="#less-stressful-fun-to-tinker">#</a></h3><p>This one is simply a personal observation on how I’ve had a mentality shift working with MiniPCs.
Because of the decentralized, isolated nature of their hardware within my home network, I am generally much braver when
tinkering with it.</p><p>Taking the container service compute out of my NAS and into a separate MiniPC allowed me to confidently do whatever to
it, because it’s separate.
I couldn’t accidentally screw up my NAS by working on the homelab server.
Even if that was technically true in a virtualized environment inside the NAS, this is about subjective feeling.
This placebo of bravery and confidence is very fun and rewarding.</p><p>Same thing with having the M4 Mini on my second desk.
In the rare event that I do something that temporarily incapacitates my main PC, I am at least relieved I have a backup
computer ready to use if I have important tasks and responsibilities.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion
<a href="#conclusion">#</a></h2><p>MiniPCs are a <em>great idea</em> if you’re just looking into starting a homelab.
They scale with you, around you, and aren’t a big upfront investment.</p><p>It’s indeed a far cry from the initial fantasies I had when first getting into homelabs and self-hosting, namely big
beautiful racks <em>(of server hardware!)</em> I’d hide locked in a ventilated closet.
I, for one, am extremely satisfied with the modest but very useful setup I ended up having.</p><p>There are many resources and communities online you can look up if you want to learn more.
You should give it a try!</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>Building the Mouse Logitech Won't Make</h2>
<p>2025.08.24 · 5 min read</p>

<p>My absolute favorite mouse is the MX Ergo from Logitech. It's a trackball mouse with a good number of buttons and a comfortable, ergonomic tilt. It clicked with me as soon as I tried it, and I've been using one since they came out back in 2017.</p>
<p>However, it's not without its issues. There are 3 main areas where the sheen of perfection wears off:</p>
<ol>
<li>It uses a micro-USB port to charge.</li>
<li>The switches are a little loud and clicky.</li>
<li>The software is bloated.</li>
</ol>
<p>After 8 years waiting for an updated model from Logitech, I decided to stop waiting and see if I could tackle these issues myself.</p>
<p><em>After first publishing this article a helpful commenter let me know Logitech released the MX Ergo S in late 2024, with quieter switches, USB-C, and a $20 price increase. Let's just pretend I wrote this article a year ago! Still, at least this project let me avoid some e-waste.</em></p>
<h2>The Fixes</h2>
<div>
<p>General Disclaimer</p>
<p>These mods could mess up your mouse and will definitely void your warranty. Rechargable batteries can cause fires if handled improperly!</p>
</div>
<h3>Adding USB-C Charging</h3>
<p>I went in apprehensive - how much of a hassle would it be to swap a port? The easiest solution would be to get a short adapter plug and leave it in the mouse, but that felt like it would be a constant reminder of my lack of ambition.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I soon found this incredible <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Converting-the-Logitech-MXERGO-Trackball-Mouse-to-/">guide</a> on how to seamlessly replace the existing port. The port sits on a small PCB under the mainboard. The author of the guide reverse-engineered that PCB, then modified it to accommodate a USB-C port. He made the <a href="https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Logitech_MX_Ergo_USB_C_PCB_replacement_89459dce.html">designs</a> available through PCBWay, and while you can export the design files and send them anywhere you'd like, I opted to stay with PCBWay to manufacture the boards for my project (I ended up ordering 10 so I had spares).</p>
<p><img alt="PCB Mid-Assembly" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/pcb-mid-assembly.jpeg"></p>
<p>Balking at the $50+ charge for turnkey assembly, I opted to take the financially responsible route and pay $200+ for a hot-air rework station to solder it myself. I transferred as many components from the Logitech board as I could. That meant I only needed to source the new port, some resistors, a replacement ribbon cable connector, and a switch.</p>
<p>Getting spare PCBs and components saved me a lot of hassle, as it gave me the opportunity to practice soldering some of the trickier components (the USB-C port turned out to be especially finicky). After some initial trial and error I was able to successfully assemble the new board! </p>
<p><img alt="Fitting the assembled PCB into the mouse" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/assembled-pcb.jpeg"></p>
<p>Some quick modifications to the case with a rotary tool provided enough clearance for the larger port. After reassembling the mouse, I was left with a pretty seamless result!</p>
<p><img alt="Finished Mouse with New Port" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/mouse-new-port.jpeg"></p>
<p>Overall I spent $45 for the PCBs and around $10 for the required components, making this a reasonably pricey mod. You could probably find an intro discount from a PCB manufacturer to lower the prices a bit! If you're interested in trying this out for yourself, I'd recommend reading through Solderking's <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Converting-the-Logitech-MXERGO-Trackball-Mouse-to-/">guide</a>.</p>
<h3>Silent Switches</h3>
<p>The one mouse that nearly pulled me away from the MX Ergo was the MX Master 3S, also from Logitech. It uses some fantastic silent switches for the left and right clicks, which I found I much preferred over regular mouse switches. </p>
<p>I wanted to replicate that experience as much as I could for the MX Ergo. I started by disassembling the mouse and measuring each switch used so I could find alternatives I might prefer.</p>
<p>The left and right clicks use standard microswitches, and I struck gold with the first alternatives I tried! The <a href="https://lethal.gg/products/huano-silent-2-pcs?_pos=11&amp;_sid=74aa60c1a&amp;_ss=r">Huano Silent</a> switches are exactly what I was looking for. They are almost completely silent, with a soft but satisfying tactile bump when pressed. </p>
<p><img alt="Huano Switch Close-up" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/huano-close-up.jpeg"></p>
<p>The scroll-wheel clicks use <code>6x6x4.3mm</code> through-hole switches, while the other buttons use <code>5.25x5.25x1.5mm</code> surface-mount switches. I wasn't as sure about how to find options that might suit me better, as these are essentially commodity products. I ended up ordering a few different options, and settled on the Omron <code>B3F-1002</code> for the scroll-wheel clicks and the Alps Alpine <code>SKQGABE010</code> (see below, left is the new switch and right is the old) for the other buttons.</p>
<p><img alt="SMD Switch Old and New" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/old-new-smd.jpeg"></p>
<p>After desoldering and removing the old switches, soldering in their replacements, and reassembling the mouse I could finally try out new switches in actual use. The Huano Silent switches were a huge improvement for me and only cost $2.99! If I were to make one mod this would be it (I ended up ordering a bunch more of them just so I have spares for future mice). While I did notice the change from the other switches, the difference was more minimal and I would probably skip them next time.</p>
<p>If you're interested in trying this for yourself, I'd recommend following a guide like <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Logitech+G603+Switch+Replacement/165937#s349713">this one from iFixit</a> on how to desolder and replace a mouse switch. While the mouse is different the soldering technique is the same!</p>
<h3>Software Upgrade</h3>
<p>I really dislike Logitech's peripheral configuration software (Logi Options+). I find it to be bloated, buggy, and <a href="https://512pixels.net/2024/04/ai-overlay-tmp-home-folder-mac-os/">occasionally malware-like</a>. In 2024 I started using <a href="https://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/">SteerMouse</a>, and I haven't looked back. It's super lightweight, it can do everything I need it to, and most importantly it just works. I mainly use it to configure the thumb and side buttons to move me between desktop spaces. While it does cost $20, it adds a lot of customization and it works with many other peripherals.</p>
<p><img alt="Steermouse Demo" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/steermouse.png"></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall I'm really happy with how this project turned out. I highly recommend swapping in the Huano Silent switches, while the other switch changes are probably overkill. The USB-C port swap isn't super necessary, but it was a fun project and a great introduction to surface-mount soldering. Moving to SteerMouse is easy and boring but it's a much better experience!</p>
<p>More generally, I think there's a lot of fun to be had tweaking the objects we use every day to our liking. Aside from a great mouse, this project has given me a bunch of ideas for things to try next.</p>

<p><strong>FORT GARLAND —</strong> In the sandy hills scattered with piñon pine and spiky yucca, hundreds of people have relied on a water supply that is so much a part of the local culture that Costilla County residents describe it as a way of life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Drilling for water is a pricey gamble on the high desert where many live off the grid at 7,500 to 10,000 feet of elevation. A well could cost $25,000 with no guarantee that water will spring, even after digging hundreds of feet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead, many people in the poorest county in the state have opted for cisterns, reservoirs buried underground and covered with a plastic lid or cement slab. To fill them, residents drive 20 minutes or so to town, often weekly, with tanks in their pickup trucks or on their trailers to buy water at 10 cents a gallon, or they have it delivered for an extra fee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is time-consuming, tedious and steeped in routine. And in Fort Garland, the system was abruptly cut off this month — without warning or notice.</p>

<p>The fight over the water has pitted residents of Fort Garland who have plumbing and pay for metered water against those living outside the city limits with cisterns. The board of the Fort Garland Water and Sanitation District — which cut off water sales to rural residents Aug. 1 in a 3-2 vote that wasn’t even on its meeting agenda — has devolved into shouting matches and dysfunction. Board members have referred to disgruntled residents as an “angry mob,” and one city resident shushed the water district administrator as she explained the deficiencies of the town water system.&nbsp;</p>


<p>People who relied on Fort Garland water to fill their cisterns have been left dry. In the heat of summer, some have gotten water from neighbors who have wells, though well-sharing is illegal. Some are driving two hours to Pueblo to buy water. Many have been getting water in the town of Blanca, where officials offered — only as an emergency solution until the end of August — to let people fill up water tanks from a hose connected to a fire hydrant.</p>

<p>The water crisis has forced older residents to contemplate selling their dream homes, where they had planned to retire. Others are wondering whether to scrap plans to build on their property, leaving home for showers and limiting their toilet flushes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Underneath it all is a deep concern about whether this is a preview of the water wars ahead as the West deals with <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2025/08/21/colorado-river-forced-water-cuts-state-official-plan/">unprecedented drought</a> and its residents compete for a resource that is finite yet essential to life.</p>

But since the Fort Garland Water &amp; Sanitation District ended bulk water sales to people living outside town limits, the couple has been scrambling to fill their cistern with water. (Mike Sweeney, Special to The Colorado Sun)</figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="h-water-was-never-guaranteed">Water was never guaranteed</h2>

<p>Most of those affected live in the Sangre de Cristo Ranches, a 44,000-acre residential area that once was the <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/multimillionaire-sells-historic-ranch-to-billionaire/73-343274758#:~:text=FORT%20GARLAND%20(AP)%20%2D%20Multimillionaire,fund%20manager%20Louis%20Moore%20Bacon.&amp;text=The%20Forbes%20family%20had%20held,of%20Denver%2C%20for%20four%20decades.">Forbes Trinchera Ranch</a>. The dwellings range from multistory homes with sweeping decks facing Blanca Peak, the standout of the mountain range, to modest one-room houses and campers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some residents have wells. But hundreds of people in the county of about 3,700 rely on cisterns to drink, cook and bathe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The situation is most dire for those who are older or have physical disabilities. Many were paying a private business, Wood &amp; Water, to deliver water purchased from the Fort Garland filling station to their cisterns. The local couple who operated the water and firewood service in the San Luis Valley <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100090129622788">closed within days</a> of the Fort Garland water board vote.</p>

<p>Amanda Ellis and Paul Branson live off a dirt road, no neighbors within sight. They run an apothecary and a wildfire mitigation business, grow vegetables and herbs, use solar power, and have a cistern buried under the sandy earth near their driveway. The water in the cistern is piped to their faucets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Losing their water source has caused daily stress and deep-seated worry.</p>

<p>When water isn’t available, finding it becomes all-consuming. “Hauling water is your water for everything — lifestyle, dishes, consumption, the whole bit,” said Branson, who for years worked in emergency management. “So not having that immediate option is of great concern. It’s stressful.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s unnerving, to the point that Branson has wondered whether cutting off water to rural residents is a step in the San Luis Valley’s hazardous mitigation plan for drought. “It seems like locking down on water availability is possibly a theme here, which begs the question, why?” he said. “Here are some things we’ll do should its ugly head start to rise and impact people, right?”</p>

<p>Ellis bought the house five years ago after traveling the country in a van as a freelance journalist. “I was always drawn to the mountains when I was traveling around the country and, to be honest, it was affordable,” she said. “It was off grid. It had a structure. It was away from people. The view is incredible. There’s climbing, hiking. It was somewhere I could afford and have land in Colorado.”</p>

<p>Having water was never a “guarantee,” she knows, but the way county residents were cut off with no warning, no time to prepare, was unethical, she said. Many residents had no idea how tenuous the water supply actually was.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Realtors are selling homes with (cistern) permits saying that there’s the availability to get water hauled in,” Ellis said. “It was never guaranteed. Apparently, they are not and never have been obligated to sell water outside of city limits. They’ve just done that for a very long time.”</p>

<h2 id="h-water-pump-broke-water-restrictions-stirred-up-anger">Water pump broke, water restrictions stirred up anger</h2>

<p>The trouble began when the pump broke in Fort Garland’s water system.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Salina Pacheco, who is the manager of the town water district and training to become a water system operator, knew it was coming. She had been talking to the five-member water board about it for two years and had helped secure a $105,000 grant from the Colorado Department of Local Affairs to upgrade the water system, which was suffering from “extreme water hammer” because water traveling through the pipes in opposite directions was colliding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pump failed in June, before the system’s planned overhaul. Townspeople were asked to use the “bare minimum” of water — flush the toilets, but don’t water the lawn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frustrations grew, culminating in about 10 people showing up at the Aug. 1 water board meeting to demand action. They wanted the town to stop selling what’s called “bulk water” to residents of unincorporated Costilla County.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the meeting intensified, with people “hollering” and cutting off each other’s sentences, board members called for a vote, even though the issue was not on their agenda, Pacheco recalled. One man held up a hand in her face as she tried to explain why she didn’t think selling water to rural residents was impacting the town’s water system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“These men were brought in because I had put them on a water restriction schedule,” Pacheco said in an interview. “They are upset they can’t water their lawns while people can’t have water to actually live.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fort Garland uses 120 acre-feet of water per year — that’s 120 acres covered by 1 foot of water. Sales to people in cisterns account for about 1 acre feet per year, Pacheco said. Revenue for the water sales to rural residents totaled $43,000 per year, about 15% of total revenue.</p>

<p>Still, board president John Sanchez and two other members voted to shut down bulk water sales. Customers found out on Facebook after rural residents went to buy water and were turned away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sanchez did not return a request for comment. Pacheco alleged he is trying to get the board to fire her.</p>


<p>Pacheco said she has brought in attorneys to train board members on meeting rules, including how to listen to public comment and not fight back or take immediate votes on issues raised by the audience. Some of the board members “have been trying to move past the craziness,” she said. “I’ve told all of the board members, ‘I need you to understand your positions.’”&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the board president, she said: “Somebody needs to shut him down.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Hopefully we can come together as a community,” Pacheco said. “This could bring us together instead of creating them and us.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Water board member Anthony Neville was among the three to vote to shut off water sales. He told The Sun he did it because he understood why townspeople were angry about the water restrictions and that they “pay religiously” for their metered water. The water district’s bylaws do not say that it must sell water to people outside of Fort Garland.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Now that we don’t want to sell water, they think we are obligated to sell water,” Neville said. “No, we are not.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>I get that everybody needs water. There are kids up there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>— Anthony Neville, <em>member of Fort Garland water board</em></p>
</div>

<p>But Neville said he would vote in the future to restore water sales to rural people.&nbsp;</p>


<p>The water pump is fixed now. He’s hoping Sangre de Cristo Ranches residents will sign a petition that could result in another board vote and that the rest of the board “would have a heart.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I get that everybody needs water,” he said. “There are kids up there.”&nbsp;</p>


<h2 id="h-when-water-seems-scarce-long-time-residents-blame-the-newcomers">When water seems scarce, long-time residents blame the newcomers</h2>

<p>John and Debi Marks bought property in the ranches two years ago with plans to build a retirement home and live off the grid among the pines. For now, the couple in their 50s are living in a camper, parked near the markers that stake out the outline of their future home. The plan is to power with solar and grow food in a small greenhouse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They opted for a cistern instead of a well, bought the $500 permit and had it buried on their property. They were among the customers of Wood &amp; Water until it went out of business.</p>

<p>The Marks’ plans for their next chapter were going smoothly — maybe minus the rattlesnakes seeking shade under their camper. Then their water source evaporated.</p>

<p>Since then, they’ve been on a disciplined mission to fill their 1,750-gallon cistern to the top and conserve water as strictly as possible. They’ve made the most of the town of Blanca’s offer of emergency water on Tuesdays and Thursdays 8 a.m. to noon. The Marks are squeezing in two trips each morning to fill the 275-gallon tank in the back of their pickup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They figure a full cistern is enough to last them six months in the camper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We wanted to be as independent as possible, and so we searched all over the state for property that would fit our needs, and this fit the bill,” Debi Marks said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They love it in the valley, surrounded by mountains on all sides, but they have felt resentment from some of the longtime residents, the accusation that they showed up “unprepared” to live out here. When a necessity for life like water seems scarce, people turn on each other.</p>

<p>“I think a lot of what we’re dealing with are small-town politics,” John Marks said. “We all have a common need that is a valuable, sacred resource that we’re clamoring for, and we just want to be part of a community, to kind of help make things better for us all. So work with us. Please don’t work against us.”</p>

(Mike Sweeney, Special to The Colorado Sun)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Elaine, who did not want her full name used because she is a 79-year-old widow who lives alone on a rural dirt road, moved with her late husband to Costilla County full time about 20 years ago. Her in-laws had purchased the property in the 1970s, site unseen, from an ad in Forbes magazine, the owner of which also owned Forbes ranch. When presented with the option of drilling a well or buying water tanks and a cistern, they opted for a cistern.</p>

<p>“That was part of the deal with Forbes, that there would always be water available to those who bought property in the ranches, and so there was no need for us to drill a well,” she said, sitting on her deck last week under a huge blue sky.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At first, the Forbes Ranch offered water service. Residents just had to call the ranch headquarters when their tanks were low, and a water delivery would arrive, for a fee. When the ranch sold, that arrangement ended, and Elaine and her husband started making regular trips to Fort Garland to fill their water tanks. After he died two years ago, after 60 years of marriage, a friend began helping her with the task.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, for the first time since moving to her dream home where she looks at the mountains and watches the swarms of hummingbirds on her deck, she is thinking of moving away, perhaps closer to her children and grandchildren. She has started calling well drillers and was quoted from $18,000 to $25,000 with no guarantees. The wait list is about a year.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Knowing that when the water in her tank runs out, she may not get more, has made Elaine vigilant about usage. Like many of her neighbors, she started taking showers at the community center instead of her home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“You count the times you flush the toilet,” she said. “I know that it takes 13 gallons to wash a load of clothes. I know that it takes 6 gallons to do my dishwasher.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I’ve lived a long life, and we worked hard to have this, and it’s not right at my age that I have to do all that. It’s fine if they want to say, ‘OK, we’re not going to do water anymore,’ but with no notice, no reason? To me, it’s inhumane. It’s not morally right either. Where’s your compassion? They forgot about the people.”</p>

<h2 id="h-solution-pitched-to-county-commissioners">Solution pitched to county commissioners</h2>

<p>Residents recently brought their concerns to a meeting of the Costilla County commissioners. The most compelling public comment came from a new resident who brought a detailed project pitch for creating a county water station that would serve all the residents who’ve been buying water in Fort Garland, Blanca and the Wildhorse Mesa community. Commissioners responded quickly, with a plan to discuss the off-grid water situation during an emergency work session next week and to take it up at their meeting in early September.</p>

<p>The pitch was to open a metered bulk water filling station on county property modeled after <a href="https://www.canoncity.org/494/Bulk-Water-Station">one in Cañon City</a> and using the pre-paid account model similar to the one used by <a href="https://www.suitutil.com/bulk-water-fill-station/">Southern Ute Utilities</a> in southwestern Colorado. The project would cost from $120,000 to $240,000 to build, about $15,000 per year in operating costs and $25,000 per year in water costs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The county is likely to qualify for grants to cover much of the cost, and could net from $95,000 to $120,000 a year, according to the proposal from Sangre de Cristo Ranches resident Wesley Barnett, a former oil field worker from Texas who has dealt with water issues in the oil patch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The downside, though, is that it would take about a year to put it together, he said. “There’s still a gap,” Barnett said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A more immediate solution is a potential plan to have a private company bring a water tanker to county-owned property in Fort Garland.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Until there is a solution, rural residents are meticulously tracking their gallons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Marks stopped flowing water through their camper, instead hauling in 6 gallons at a time, so they can better track what they use. “It’s just that difficult,” John Marks said. “We’re hand-washing, filling bowls of water. We’re not sure about the future, so we’re just trying to be conservative.”</p>

<p>Doai Eki, situated right by the border between Gunma and Niigata prefectures, is one of the most unique stations you’ll come across in all of Japan. Serving the Joetsu Line, the station seems relatively normal to any passengers travelling southbound in the direction of Tokyo. As with most stations in rural Japan, it appears to be a non descript building with no attendants, no ticket gate and a few vending machines to get you through the 45 minute wait between trains.</p>

<p>However, if travelling northbound in the direction of Niigata, the station takes on a vastly different character. The northbound platform is a 15 minute walk away from the main station building. A majority of this walk consists of a 70m descent down almost 500 steps into the Shin-Shimizu tunnel. The descent is terrifying, with little vision of what awaits you at the end as you venture further and further into the depths. Water from the nearby rivers can also be heard trickling into the tunnel at a faster and faster rate as you near the bottom.</p>

<p>Finally arriving at the northbound platform, you’ll find yourself in a sinister cavern deep within a neighboring mountain. As such, Doai has aptly been named “Japan’s no 1 station for moles.” The tunnel is dark and dank and it’s noticeably harder to breathe while you wait for your train. The only semblance of life is a small waiting room that’s littered with photos and scrap paper/pens for visitors to leave notes. While I imagine this is meant as a fun way to pass the time, the anonymous notes and random photos on the wall add an eerie, Silent Hill-esque touch to the cavernous space.</p>






















</div><div data-block-type="2" data-sqsp-block="text" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1647321900636_7105">

<p>Adding to the overall spookiness of the station is the fact that it’s deep within a mountain that neighbors Mount Tanigawa - known as Death Mountain due to its treacherous climb. Over 800 people have died trying to reach the top of Tanigawa with one climbing group in 1943 going missing for 30 years before their corpses were eventually discovered.</p>

  <!--<b>How To Fix Firefox's Find-in-Page for Keyboard Navigation</b>-->
<b>A Small Change To Improve Browsers for Keyboard Navigation</b>

<pre><i>We choose to use Firefox, not because it's easy but because it's hard.
~ jfk probably</i>

(This problem applies to Chrome too though)

If you want to navigate websites with the keyboard you can make use of the ' search feature (aka "quick find for links") in Firefox. Just press ' and start typing. Any link with the anchor text you type will get highlighted. Once you press enter, firefox will navigate to the link under the highlighted anchor text.

Too bad most websites nowadays don't use links for navigation and actions. They have buttons and divs and once you click them stuff happens. 

And here lies the limitation with the other two build-in find features. Though the / (quick find) and the ctrl+f (find in page) search will highlight any text (not just links), nothing will happen if you press enter on that highlighted text
(once you dismissed the search dialog with escape).

<p>Test it for yourself.
Hello this is a link to my <a href="https://h.43z.one/">homepage</a>
and this a link with javascript:alert(1)<br>
here a button with an  handler.<br>
and here a <span onclick="alert(3)">span with an onclick handler</span>
</p>

Wouldn't it be great if firefox would just, like you know, <i>click</i> on the
highlighted text (browser created a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Selection">selection</a>) whenever I press enter?!

YES IT WOULD and that's why I created this little <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/click-on-selection-with-enter/">extension</a>.
All it does is inject these lines.
<code>addEventListener('keydown', event =&gt; {
  if(event.key !== 'Enter')
    return

  // more cases that should not hook enter are to be discovered...
  if(event.shiftKey)
    return

  const elementWithSelection = getSelection()?.anchorNode?.parentElement

  if(!elementWithSelection)
    return

  elementWithSelection.click()
  getSelection()?.removeAllRanges()
})
</code>
The code just gets the node that has the current <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getSelection">selection</a>.
Then looks for the parent html element of that node and clicks it.
Afterwards removes the selection.

This tiny hack makes keyboard navigation just so much better ~ <a href="https://x.com/h43z">h43z</a>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="The Unlikely Revival of Nuclear Batteries"><p><strong>In 1970, surgeons in</strong> Paris implanted the first nuclear-powered pacemaker, and over the next five years, at least 1,400 additional people received the devices, mostly in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/france">France</a> and the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/united-states">United States</a>. Encased in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/titanium">titanium</a>, the batteries for these devices contained a radioactive isotope—typically about a tenth of a gram of plutonium-238—and could operate for decades without maintenance. The invention provided relief to a population of people who previously needed surgery every few years to change out their pacemaker’s chemical battery.</p><p>As time went on, though, the whereabouts of these radioactive tickers became increasingly difficult to track. In the United States, the devices were supposed to be returned to the U.S. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/department-of-energy">Department of Energy</a> for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/plutonium">plutonium</a> recovery. But often, that didn’t happen. Doctors changed jobs, manufacturers went out of business, patients died, and families forgot about their loved one’s pacemaker. Too often, the radioactive material landed in crematoriums and coffins.</p><p>Uncomfortable with the situation, regulators worldwide nixed the devices. The last known nuclear-powered pacemaker was implanted in 1988. After that, aside from a few specialty uses, such as deep-space probes and Siberian lighthouses, development and deployment of nuclear batteries effectively came to a halt.</p><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"> <img alt="Two human hands using instruments to manipulate the pieces of a small metal object labeled as radioactive" data-rm-shortcode-id="5e7c338237fd9b5fad3a61814e5a47e3" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-human-hands-using-instruments-to-manipulate-the-pieces-of-a-small-metal-object-labeled-as-radioactive.png?id=61487696&amp;width=980" height="2984" id="cea8b" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-human-hands-using-instruments-to-manipulate-the-pieces-of-a-small-metal-object-labeled-as-radioactive.png?id=61487696&amp;width=980" width="3000"> <small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Medtronic’s 1970 Laurens-Alcatel pulse generator powered <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/pacemakers">pacemakers</a> with plutonium-238. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Smith Collection/Getty Images </small></p><p>Technology never truly dies, and nuclear batteries are no exception. Research <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-daintiest-dynamos" target="_self">grew active again after 2000</a>, although it lacked commercial translation. But over the last year, a host of companies and research groups around the world have announced advances that they say will invigorate the technology and extend its use to robots, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/drones">drones</a>, sensors, and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/solar-farms">solar farms</a>, as well as spacecraft and biomedical <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/implants">implants</a>.</p><p>The new groups are employing modern, more-exotic technology that goes beyond the designs of the past, allowing them to pursue the finest nuclear batteries ever made. As with the first generation, the allure of nuclear batteries is still their extraordinarily long life-spans: several decades and, with proper fuel choice, possibly centuries. They could also deliver more energy in packages that weigh less than those of chemical batteries.</p><p>The question is, who’s going to buy them? I’ve been involved in this sector for nearly 40 years as a nuclear engineer, professor, and consultant. Here’s what I’ve observed: The technology works, it has many advantages over chemical batteries, and it can be utilized safely. But what very few companies have been able to do is find a new market for these batteries and make a product that has an impact. Part of the problem is that there is no good solution to the need to track these sources and make sure they are disposed of properly at the end of the battery’s life.</p><p>There are more companies working out the challenges now than I’ve ever seen in my career, and that’s good for the field—it helps ground the academic research. And it gives me hope that this could be the moment when nuclear batteries finally flourish.</p><h2>How Do Nuclear Batteries Work?  </h2><p>The term “nuclear batteries” may evoke images of tiny <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/nuclear-reactors">nuclear reactors</a>, but that’s not how they work. Nuclear batteries don’t split atoms with neutron bombardment. Instead, they capture energy in the form of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/radiation">radiation</a> that’s spontaneously released when atomic nuclei decay.</p><p>Most research groups developing nuclear batteries are focused on harnessing energy from radioactive isotopes of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/nickel">nickel</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/hydrogen">hydrogen</a>. In many nuclear battery designs, adjacent <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/semiconductors/">semiconductors</a> absorb the radiation released by the radioisotopes’ nuclei and convert it to an electric current, much like a solar cell does. In other designs, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/thermoelectric">thermoelectric</a> devices convert the heat produced by the emitted radiation to electricity. So “radioisotope power source” is a better descriptor than “nuclear battery,” but for ease of language, I’ll use these terms interchangeably.</p><p> <img alt="A coin-shaped metal object displaying a radioactive symbol and other details about its contents " data-rm-shortcode-id="0ac3d60e7253b6de5ea95009da720df5" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-coin-shaped-metal-object-displaying-a-radioactive-symbol-and-other-details-about-its-contents.png?id=61487756&amp;width=980" height="620" id="7d529" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-coin-shaped-metal-object-displaying-a-radioactive-symbol-and-other-details-about-its-contents.png?id=61487756&amp;width=980" width="1115"> <small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Infinity Power uses a novel electrochemical process to convert the radioactive decay of nickel-63 into electricity. The company says it can scale the technology from microwatts to megawatts.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Infinity Power </small></p><p>On the heels of some laboratory successes, researchers are racing to commercialize these devices. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-atomic-energy-authority" target="_blank">United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority</a> (UKAEA), Miami-based <a href="https://citylabs.net/" target="_blank">City Labs</a>, Beijing Betavolt New Energy Technology Co., and China’s <a href="https://www.nwnu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Northwest Normal University</a> have all announced advances and funding in semiconductor-based nuclear batteries over the last two years, some with plans to commercialize. Last year, <a href="https://www.infinitypower.energy/" target="_blank">Infinity Power</a>, in San Diego, announced a novel electrochemical approach to converting radioisotope energy.</p><p>What markets these batteries will find—if they can be commercialized—will depend largely on cost, safety, and licensing issues. One of the most compelling applications is in uncrewed spacecraft for long-distance missions, which require decades of reliable power. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/solar-power">Solar power</a> works for missions close to the sun, but by the time a spacecraft gets to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/jupiter">Jupiter</a>, the available solar irradiance drops below 4 percent of that on Earth.</p><p>That leaves <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/nuclear-fission">nuclear fission</a> and radioisotope power as the only viable options for deep-space missions. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/fission">Fission</a> is ideal for larger power needs in space, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/lunar-nuclear-reactor-nasa-moon?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=hero&amp;utm_campaign=2025-08-22&amp;utm_content=hero1" target="_blank">like NASA’s proposed 100-kilowatt lunar nuclear reactor</a>. But for lower, onboard power needs, nuclear batteries offer simpler designs and lower mass. The current radioisotope workhorse in space is the radioisotope <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/thermoelectric-generator">thermoelectric generator</a>, or RTG, which produces a few hundred watts.</p><h2>Radioisotopes: Not Just for Nuclear-Powered Pacemakers </h2><p>NASA’s two <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/voyager">Voyager</a> missions, launched in 1977, each carry three RTGs that weigh about 38 kilograms, including 4.5 kg of plutonium-238. They’re cylindrical and about the size of an office wastebasket. They initially produced 157 watts of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electric-power">electric power</a>, but that drops over time as the plutonium-238 decays. A 157-W Voyager-based RTG that launched in 1977 will produce about 88 W today.</p><p><img id="607f2" data-rm-shortcode-id="71cf1dc40be3b7c479d367502adafb39" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-cylindrical-metal-machines-stacked-on-top-of-each-other-in-a-cinder-block-room.png?id=61487716&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/two-cylindrical-metal-machines-stacked-on-top-of-each-other-in-a-cinder-block-room.png?id=61487716&amp;width=980" width="2700" height="3541" alt="Two cylindrical metal machines stacked on top of each other in a cinder block room"><small><p>Radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) provide onboard power for NASA’s Voyager missions by converting heat generated by the decay of plutonium-238.</p></small><small>JPL-Caltech/NASA</small></p><div id="rebelltitem13" data-id="13" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-battery-revival/particle-13" data-basename="particle-13" data-post-id="2673897887" data-published-at="1755884071" data-use-pagination="False"><p>Another good use for nuclear batteries is to supply power in remote locations on Earth. Beginning in the 1970s, for example, the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/soviet-union">Soviet Union</a> deployed over 1,000 RTGs in northwestern <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/russia">Russia</a> to power its uncrewed lighthouses, radio beacons, and weather stations. Most of these batteries ran on strontium-90, and each weighed about 2,000 kg. The United States has deployed hundreds of similar systems for remote power both on land and on the ocean floor, particularly for <a href="http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2013/ph241/jiang1/docs/ota-bp-eti-129.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">remote monitoring sites in the Arctic</a>.</p><p>While nuclear batteries have proved successful for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/space-exploration">space exploration</a>, remote power, and pacemakers, no new uses for these long-lived batteries have emerged. Many devices would benefit from long-lived batteries—imagine a wireless tire <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/pressure-sensor">pressure sensor</a> that lasts the life of a car, for example. But the risks and costs of opting for a radioactive battery would have to be balanced against the benefits.</p><p>Another factor working against the widespread use of nuclear batteries is the need to track the fuel. In just about any country, the sellers and buyers of any such batteries intended for the general public would need to be licensed (see box, “Boy Amasses Large Quantity of Radioactive Material in His Home: A Cautionary Tale”). The buyer also typically takes on the burden of tracking and disposing of the material. Keeping tabs on radioactive material is a necessity, but this adds complexity to applications involving the general public.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem11" data-id="11" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-battery-revival/particle-11" data-basename="particle-11" data-post-id="2673897887" data-published-at="1755884071" data-use-pagination="False"><p>One new use where the benefits may outweigh the risks and costs is providing longer-lived power to soldiers—something the U.S. military has explored. Soldiers’ missions often take them to remote or unstable locations where electricity may be unavailable, preventing them from charging their equipment. This forces soldiers to carry batteries, the weight and life of which limit their missions. Small nuclear batteries would provide a lightweight alternative—potentially 1/100 the weight—due to their higher <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/energy-density">energy density</a> relative to that of chemical batteries. But they would need to be encased to shield soldiers from the radiation, and designed to withstand harsh conditions, which would add weight.</p><p>Another potential new use for nuclear batteries is to power autonomous sensors or robots that communicate, move, or fly. One compelling use would be <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/flying-robot-2671447539" target="_self">insect-size flying microdrones</a> for civilian and military purposes. But collecting them at the end of their flights might be difficult and would also leave tiny bits of radioactive material littering the landscape.</p><h2>Engineering Challenges: Betavoltaics Versus Alphavoltaics</h2><p>Let’s turn to the engineering challenges of commercializing a miniature nuclear battery. In general, taking a promising battery technology from the lab to mass production is a complex process that’s more likely to end in failure than success. With nuclear batteries, it involves negotiating a lot of trade-offs between cost, power, safety, and life-span.</p><p>First, you have to pick the fuel—that is, an isotope of an element that will release radiation as it decays. Such isotopes emit three types of radiation: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gamma-rays">gamma rays</a>, beta particles, and alpha particles. Gamma rays are short-wavelength <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electromagnetic-waves">electromagnetic waves</a> that can travel deep into most solids, including living tissue. They’re difficult to contain and capture, so gamma-emitting isotopes are typically avoided.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem9" data-id="9" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-battery-revival/particle-9" data-basename="particle-9" data-post-id="2673897887" data-published-at="1755634855" data-use-pagination="False"><p>Pure beta or alpha emitters are a better choice for nuclear batteries. Beta particles are electrons that have an intermediate penetration range in solids. Their decay energies go from a few kiloelectron volts (for tritium, or hydrogen-3) to a few megaelectron volts (for yttrium-90). Alpha particles, by contrast, are emitted at a higher energy than beta particles—typically around 5 MeV—and can’t penetrate a piece of paper. But they can damage semiconductors by creating defects as they collide with the nuclei in the device. This makes alpha emitters best suited for non-semiconductor battery technologies that convert the heat generated by the source fuel into electricity.</p><p>Radioisotopes of nickel, carbon, hydrogen, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/sulfur">sulfur</a>, promethium, polonium, and plutonium all emit beta or alpha particles and are good options for nuclear batteries (see “Table 1: Radioisotopes Used in Nuclear Batteries”). Which one to choose depends on several factors, including the isotope’s half-life and its decay energy.</p><p>For the longest battery life, you’ll want a radioisotope with a long half-life, because the battery’s output power will drop by a factor of two over each half-life. That means a tritium-fueled device will lose half its power every 12 years, while a plutonium-238 battery will lose half its power every 88 years.</p></div><p>What very few companies have been able to do is find a new market for these batteries and make a product that has an impact. </p><div id="rebelltitem2" data-id="2" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-battery-revival/particle-2" data-basename="particle-2" data-post-id="2673897887" data-published-at="1755621580" data-use-pagination="False"><p>If your goal is instead to maximize the battery’s power density—such as for an insect-size microdrone—then you’ll need one with a short half-life<strong>.</strong> For example, polonium-210 has a half-life of a few months, but a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/power-density">power density</a> of 141 watts per gram, which could give it enough power to carry its payload. The short half-life would mean it would work only for a few months and would completely decay within a couple of years. But for a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/microdrone">microdrone</a> that will probably be abandoned somewhere, perhaps that’s a good thing. (Note that these power densities account for thermal power, but there are losses in converting to electricity, so the output power density of any devices created using this fuel will be lower.)</p><p>The safest nuclear battery fuels are tritium and nickel-63, because they produce low-energy beta particles that are easier to shield and less damaging to semiconductors than alpha particles. Pure tritium can be challenging to work with because it’s a gas at room temperature. It can be converted into a metal hydride, but this process, which involves mixing it with stable isotopes, decreases its energy density. Another design consideration is that the lower penetration depth of these safer, low-energy <a href="https://blanchard.engr.wisc.edu/purebeta.htm" target="_blank">beta emitters</a> requires that the sources be made very thin, or else the particles will never reach the battery’s semiconductor.</p><p>What about supply and cost? All radioisotopes are expensive to procure and are typically only available in small quantities. Just about any of them can be made during nuclear fission by placing a dedicated target material in the reactor core. They can also be made using <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/particle-accelerators">particle accelerators</a>. Some types of radioisotopes can be obtained from <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/spent-nuclear-fuel">spent nuclear fuel</a>. But none of these options is simple or inexpensive, because every step requires the handling of radioactive materials.</p><p>One gram of tritium costs about US $30,000 and will produce a thermal power of about 0.3 W, which would in turn typically produce an electric power of only a few milliwatts. The supply of plutonium-238 is so limited that <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/nasa">NASA</a> must set its launch schedule according to the availability of the fuel. As a result, NASA is pursuing americium-241 as an alternative. It’s unclear how these costs would change if the market for these materials grows substantially.</p><h2>How to Convert Radioisotope Power Sources</h2><p>After choosing a fuel, you have to select a conversion technology. Early radioisotope power sources developed in the 1950s simply collected the charged decay particles, producing an electric potential difference between the collector and the source—that is, a voltage—that could then be tapped to produce electricity. The current in these designs was inherently low, and so the battery had to be run at a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/high-voltage">high voltage</a> (in the kilovolts) to achieve a reasonable conversion efficiency, which proved too challenging.</p><p>To get around this problem, you can use a semiconductor to turn each charged particle emitted by the source into thousands of charge carriers, allowing the device to run at a few volts instead of a few kilovolts. The physics of such a device is essentially that of a solar cell, except that the source of the radiation is from a radioisotope instead of the sun. When the radioisotope is a beta-particle emitter, we call the device “betavoltaic.”</p></div><div id="rebelltitem7" data-id="7" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-battery-revival/particle-7" data-basename="particle-7" data-post-id="2673897887" data-published-at="1755634855" data-use-pagination="False"><p>Under development since the 1950s, betavoltaic batteries feature a radioactive emitter and a silicon-diode absorber. As the emitter naturally decays, electrons (in the form of beta particles) strike the absorber. This creates a cascade of electron-hole pairs, which occur when electrons are removed from their original position, leaving a “hole” that generates a small but stable supply of electric current. This process is similar to that of a solar cell, where light produces the electron-hole pairs.</p><p>Betavoltaic batteries with silicon <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/diodes">diodes</a> have conversion efficiencies of a few percent, and up to 10 percent with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/silicon-carbide">silicon carbide</a>, and can typically operate at around 1 volt. Some models indicate that this <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9936597" target="_blank">efficiency can be as high as 23.5 percent</a>. Recent research on betavoltaics uses diamond semiconductors, which offer even higher conversion efficiencies due to their higher bandgap.</p><p>Betavoltaics are solid-state, simple, and relatively inexpensive, so they offer an ideal way to produce a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/low-power">low-power</a> option (less than about a milliwatt) for nuclear batteries. They can be used to create higher-power devices, but in those cases it’s often better to switch to an alpha emitter to achieve a higher power density. However, because the alpha particles will damage a semiconductor, their use generally requires a conversion option that relies on heat converted to electricity.</p><p>For example, NASA uses thermoelectric conversion in its RTGs, which have been used to power not only <em>Voyager 1</em> and <em>2</em>, but also two <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/mars-rovers">Mars rovers</a> and over <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rps-fleet.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">40 other NASA missions</a>. If you’ve seen the movie <em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/the-martian">The Martian</a></em>, you may recall how Matt Damon’s character, trapped alone on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/mars">Mars</a>, used an RTG: He needed a heat source to stay warm while traveling in a rover, so he dug up an old RTG from a previous mission and placed it inside his vehicle.</p><p>To convert the heat to electricity, the RTGs employ a series of thermocouples, which consist of a junction of two dissimilar conductors. These components produce a potential in the presence of a temperature gradient (via what’s known as the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/resource/how-does-a-radioisotope-thermoelectric-generator-rtg-work-the-seebeck-effect/#:~:text=The%20scientist%2C%20Thomas%20Seebeck%2C%20found,of%20compounds%20known%20as%20semiconductors." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Seebeck</a> effect). The pacemakers of the 1970s also relied on thermoelectric conversion, albeit on a smaller scale.</p><p>Other, more-exotic conversion techniques include radioluminescent conversion, thermionic conversion, and thermophotovoltaic conversion (see sidebar, “Three Other Ways to Convert Radioactivity Into Electricity”), all of which work well in the lab but require higher operating temperatures or have degradation issues. Most companies are focused on developing betavoltaic technology because it permits the use of the safer beta emitters.</p><h2>Who Is Developing Nuclear Batteries?</h2><p>Since the invention of small betavoltaic power sources in the 1970s, the vast majority of research on nuclear batteries has focused on power levels of less than 1 microwatt (see “Table 2: Who’s Developing Nuclear Batteries”). To date, many of these efforts have been shrouded in secrecy, and there’s been a dearth of patents in the field, which has made it difficult to judge their features and merits.</p><p><a href="http://www.betavolt.tech/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Beijing Betavolt New Energy Technology Co.</a> says it has a 100-µW battery that’s about the size of a cereal square (15 by 15 by 5 millimeters) and can last 50 years. The company is working with betavoltaics using nickel-63, tritium, promethium-147, and strontium-90, and a diamond semiconductor to convert the energy to electricity.</p></div><p>Beijing Betavolt last year announced plans to commercially launch a 1-W version in 2025, but as of press time, it was still seeking a license and funding to do so. Potential applications include aerospace, medical implants, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/wearable-devices">wearable devices</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/mems">MEMS</a> systems, advanced sensors, small drones, miniature robots, law-enforcement equipment, and fire-safety remote communication.</p><p>Assuming Beijing Betavolt’s device has a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/conversion-efficiency">conversion efficiency</a> of about 5 percent, the battery would have to hold about 20 curies, or 740 billion becquerels (0.4 grams), of nickel-63. This is well above the typical amount of nickel-63 available on the market, which is normally in the millicurie range.</p><p>To date, many efforts have been shrouded in secrecy, and there’s been a dearth of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/patents">patents</a> in the field, which has made it difficult to judge their features and merits.</p><p>Infinity Power also uses nickel-63 in its coin-size battery, but may need less of it because of the novel electrochemical conversion process it has developed. The company says its conversion efficiency exceeds 60 percent—about six times as efficient as the best radioisotope power generators.</p><p>In Infinity’s design, the isotope is dissolved or suspended in a proprietary liquid electrolyte. The decay of the radioisotope produces high-energy beta particles that ionize the electrolyte, creating a potential difference between the anode and cathode immersed in the solution and driving electron flow through an external circuit to produce electricity.</p><p>Academic and government researchers are also pursuing nuclear batteries. The University of Bristol, in England, and the UKAEA last year announced they had developed a battery fueled by carbon-14, a radioactive form of carbon. With carbon-14’s half-life of 5,700 years, the battery could theoretically last for millennia. The U.K. has an ample supply of the fuel because it can be scavenged from the country’s graphite-moderated, gas-cooled fission reactors. Carbon-14 produces beta particles with a maximum energy of 156 kiloelectron volt, which should be low enough to prevent damage to the battery’s diamond semiconductor.</p><p>Meanwhile, a collaboration of researchers in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/china">China</a> published a report in the December 2024 <em><em>IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science</em></em> on a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10709846/authors#authors" target="_blank">radioluminescent nuclear battery</a>. The team used an X-ray source, which emits <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electromagnetic-radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a>, to mimic a beta source, which emits <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electrons">electrons</a>, to help them understand how the device might perform. The X-ray photons excited two inorganic scintillators, causing them to emit light, and a commercial silicon photodiode converted the light to electricity.</p><p>The products envisioned by these <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/startups">startups</a> offer great promise. The key to their lasting success will be identifying markets in which the benefits of nuclear batteries outweigh the challenges. The market for these devices in space applications is strong, but whether new markets will arise remains to be seen. <span></span></p><p><em>Acknowledgment: Special thanks to Yu-Tzu Chiu, who contributed reporting for this article.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

It was created at Twitter because Twitter wanted a way to allow third-party apps to post tweets on users' behalf. Take a second to imagine designing something like that today. How would you do it? One way would just be to ask the user for their username and password. So you create an unofficial Twitter client, and present the user a login screen that says "log in with Twitter". The user does so, but instead of logging into Twitter, they're actually sending their data to you, this third-party service which logs into Twitter for them.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png" width="509" height="362" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:362,&quot;width&quot;:509,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Bad way – giving a third party your password&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="Bad way – giving a third party your password" title="Bad way – giving a third party your password" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>This is bad for a lot of reasons.

In this post, we’re going to look at a typical OAuth flow.</p><p>The example I'm going to use is YNAB. If you haven't used it, YNAB is like a paid version of Mint. You connect it to a bank account, and then it pulls all your transactions from that account, and shows them to you with very pretty charts. You can categorize your spending, and then it tells you for example, hey, you're spending too much on groceries. It helps you manage your finances. So, I want to use YNAB, and I want to connect it to Chase Bank, but I don't want to give it my Chase password. So instead, I'm going to use OAuth.</p><p><span>Let's look at the flow first, and then let's understand what's going on. We're actually going to look at the flow </span><em>twice</em><span>, because I think you need to look through an OAuth flow at least two times to understand what's going on.</span></p><p>So to start, I'm at YNAB, and I want to connect Chase as a source. The OAuth flow looks like this:</p><ol><li><p>YNAB redirects me to Chase.</p></li><li><p>At Chase, I log in with my username and password.</p></li><li><p>Chase shows me a screen saying "YNAB wants to connect to Chase. Pick what accounts you want to give YNAB access to". It'll show me a list of all my accounts. Let's say I pick just my checking account, to give YNAB read access to this account, and hit OK.</p></li><li><p>From Chase, I'm redirected back to YNAB, and now, magically, YNAB is connected to Chase.</p></li></ol><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BvOT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BvOT!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BvOT!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BvOT!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BvOT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BvOT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png" width="1024" height="598" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:598,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;flow illustrated&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="flow illustrated" title="flow illustrated" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BvOT!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BvOT!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BvOT!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BvOT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F253a935b-e09d-42d2-b5f2-47c6a5b1a35e_1024x598.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>This is the experience from a user's perspective. But what happened there? What magic happened in the background, so that YNAB somehow has access to my data on Chase?</p><p><span>Remember, </span><em>the end goal of OAuth is for YNAB to end up with an access token</em><span>, so it can access my data from Chase. Somehow, as I went through this flow, YNAB ended up with an access token. I'll spoil the surprise by telling you </span><em>how</em><span> it got the access token, and then I'll walk you through what happened in more detail.</span></p><p>How does Chase give YNAB the access token? When you were redirected from Chase back to YNAB, Chase could have just added the access token in the URL. It could have redirected you back to a URL like this:</p><pre><code>https://www.ynab.com/redirect?access_token=123</code></pre><p>and then YNAB would be able to get the access token.</p><p><strong>BAD IDEA!!</strong></p><p>An access token is supposed to be secret, but anyone can see what URLs you are visiting, and they can end up in your browser's history or some server logs, in which case it's easy for anyone to see your access token.</p><p><span>So Chase could </span><em>technically</em><span> redirect you back to YNAB with the </span><em>access token</em><span> in the </span><em>URL</em><span>, and then YNAB would have the access token. End of OAuth flow. But we don’t do it this way, because </span><strong>sending an access token in the URL is not secure.</strong></p><p><span>When you were redirected from Chase back to YNAB, Chase sent YNAB an </span><em>authorization code</em><span> in the URL.</span></p><p><span>An authorization code is not an access token! Chase sends YNAB an authorization code, and YNAB </span><em>exchanges the authorization code for an access token</em><span>.

Well, if the client ID isn't valid, the request is invalid right away. If the client ID is valid, the authorization server needs to check the redirect URI. Basically, since the client ID is public, anyone could go get the YNAB client ID, and create their own OAuth flow that hits Chase, but then returns the user back to, let's say, evildude.com. But that's why when you register your app, you have to tell Chase what a valid redirect URI looks like. At that point, you would tell Chase that only YNAB.com URIs are valid, thus preventing this evildude.com scenario.</p><p>If everything is valid, the authorization server can use the client ID to get the app name, maybe the app icon, and then show a user consent screen.</p><p>The user will click which accounts they want to give YNAB access to, and hit okay.</p><p>Chase will redirect them back to the redirect URI that you gave, lets say ynab.com/oauth-callback?authorization_code=xyz.</p><blockquote><p>Side note: you might be wondering, what is the difference between URI and URL? Because I'm kind of using both. Well, a URL is any website URL that we know and love. URI is more general. URL is a type of URI, but there are many other types of URIs.</p></blockquote><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rRdo!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rRdo!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rRdo!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rRdo!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rRdo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rRdo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png" width="959" height="453" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:453,&quot;width&quot;:959,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rRdo!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rRdo!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rRdo!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rRdo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc77b18e0-6105-4ab3-98b7-dcfdc615431b_959x453.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><blockquote><p><span>The reason I'm saying redirect URI instead of redirect URL is because mobile apps won't have a URL.

You send that authorization code to the Chase authorization server, along with your client secret. Why include the client secret? Because again, the authorization code is in the URL. So anyone can see it and anyone could try to exchange it for the access token.

This is a valid request."</p><div><p><span>And then it returns the access token.

Front-channel means GET requests, where anyone can see the parameter in the URL, and back-channel means POST requests, where that data is encrypted (as part of the POST body). The reason OAuth doesn't use frontend or backend is, because you could make POST requests using JavaScript! So, theoretically, you could exchange your authorization code for an access token right on the frontend, in JavaScript, by making a POST fetch request.</p><p><span>Now, there is a big problem with this, which is you also need the client secret to make that request. And of course, once the secret is on the frontend and accessible in JavaScript, it's not secret anymore. Anyone can access it. So, instead of using the client secret, there's a different way to do it called </span><strong>PKCE</strong><span>, spelled P-K-C-E, pronounced “pixie” (seriously). It's not as secure as doing it on the backend with the client secret, but if backend is not an option for you, you can do it using PKCE. So just know that if you have an app without a back-end, you can still do OAuth.</span></p><blockquote><p>I may cover PKCE in a future post, as it is now recommended for the standard flow as well, since it helps protect against auth code interception.</p></blockquote><p>Same problem for mobile apps. Unless you have a mobile app that has a backend component, like a backend server somewhere, if you're putting your client secret in a mobile app, well, anyone can get that because there are tons of tools to extract strings from mobile apps. So, instead of including your client secret in your app, you should again use PKCE to get that access token.</p><p><span>So those are two other terms that are good to know: </span><strong>front-channel</strong><span> and </span><strong>back-channel</strong><span>.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cjpA!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cjpA!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cjpA!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cjpA!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cjpA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cjpA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png" width="222" height="233" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:233,&quot;width&quot;:222,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cjpA!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cjpA!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cjpA!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cjpA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F664b8e6f-1ad2-4984-91b9-92ae2ff135ab_222x233.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>At this point, you've seen what the OAuth flow looks like from the user's perspective, and from the developer's perspective, and you have seen the components that make it secure.</p><p>One last thing I want to mention is OAuth can look like a lot of different ways. I covered the main recommended OAuth flow above, but some people may do OAuth by passing back an access token in the redirect instead of the authorization token (doing that is called the "implicit flow"). Some people may do it using PKCE. There's even a way to do OAuth without the user consent part, but that really is not recommended. </p><p>The other part of OAuth we didn't cover is that tokens expire and you need to refresh them. And that happens through a refresh flow. Also, OAuth is all about authorization, but some workflows use OAuth to log in, such as when you use a “sign-on with Google” feature. This uses OpenID Connect, or OIDC, which is a layer on top of OAuth that also returns user data instead of just an access token. I'm mentioning this here because when you look for OAuth on the web, you'll see a lot of different flows, and you may be confused as to why they're all different. And the reason is, OAuth is not straightforward like HTTP, OAuth can look a lot of different ways.</p><p>Now you're good to go out and do your own OAuthing.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
        <em>Solar still needs storage cheap enough to move energy between seasons. I have been working on a startup to do this for the last two years.</em>
    </p><div>
<h2>The Quick Summary</h2>
<p>Standard Thermal is the company I've been leading for the last ~2 years.</p>
<p>The purpose of Standard Thermal is to make energy from solar PV available 24/7/365 at a price that is competitive with US natural gas.</p>
<p>Our technology works by storing energy as heat in the least expensive storage material available - large piles of dirt. Co-located solar PV arrays provide energy (as electricity) and are simpler and cheaper than grid-connected solar farms. Electric heating elements embedded in the dirt piles convert electricity to heat. Pipes run through the pile, and fluid flowing through them removes heat to supply the customer. The capital cost, not including the solar PV, is comparable to natural gas storage at less than $0.10/kilowatt-hour thermal and 1000x cheaper than batteries.</p>
<div><p>These are the customer archetypes we can save the most money for right now:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solar developers with oversized arrays greater than 300 kilowatts and heat demand at the location. Our system can store the summer excess production for winter thermal demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<div><p>Isolated energy users forced to use propane or fuel oil, typically using more than 50,000 gallons of propane per year.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The storage system can provide hundreds of megawatts of thermal demand as long as land is available (you can check land usage using <a href="https://www.standardthermal.com/estimator">our estimator</a>). The technology requires some scale to be cost-effective, hence the minimums.</p>
<p>Our medium-term goal is to repower coal power plants to supply electricity during seasonal lows. Repowering means the stored heat creates steam on demand for the turbines instead of burning coal.</p>
<p>We have been continuously prototyping designs at our 100-kilowatt test site in Oklahoma since last fall and are nearing our modular commercial form factor. It will be built and tested in the next several months, then it will be ready for copying and pasting at customer sites.</p>
<p><a href="https://orcasciences.com/">Orca Sciences</a> is incubating our company. We plan to spin out and close on fundraising early in 2026.</p>
<p>Read on if you'd like to know more!</p>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Raw solar PV direct current output has become cheaper than fossil fuels in many places in the last few years. But ultra-cheap energy from solar PV only means so much if it's not in the correct form or available when its needed. The shift in costs makes it the correct time to develop technologies that were irrelevant when fossil fuels were the cheapest source of energy everywhere.</p>
<p>Batteries will handle much of the daily electricity storage and firming. But several other technologies are required for solar PV to reach its full potential. One of those is a very inexpensive, reasonably efficient storage system that can hold a few months' worth of energy to flatten seasonal differences in solar production (a niche usually served by fuels). We believe thermal storage is the way to accomplish that.</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://austinvernon.site/blog/expandingenergy.html">companion post</a> called "Expanding the Marginal Energy Source," which further details how solar PV needs can become the dominant energy source.</p>
<h2>The Standard Thermal Idea</h2>
<p>Standard Thermal is about abundance. Eli Dourado and I published a paper titled <a href="https://www.thecgo.org/research/energy-superabundance/">"Energy Superabundance: How Cheap, Abundant Energy Will Shape Our Future"</a> in 2022, which details the benefits humanity would enjoy with more access to cheap energy. Standard Thermal is one part of making that a reality.</p>
<p>In the Standard Thermal system, solar PV provides the energy. It is already the cheapest source of energy in much of the world. Our thermal storage is affordable and scalable enough to allow 24/7/365 supply without overbuilding the solar array.</p>
<p>A typical site is a factory, power plant, or town with a large earthen mound at the edge. The mound might be the size of a house for a smaller factory, and up to many football fields for a large power plant. Surrounding the earthen mound will be high-density, low-profile solar arrays.</p>
<p>Electricity from the solar arrays flows to heating elements in the earthen mound, building up heat. The storage temperature is 600 °C or higher. The outer mass of the mound, plus a favorable volume-to-area ratio, insulates and minimizes heat loss. Pipes embedded in the mound carry fluid that delivers heat to users.</p>
<div><p>Both heat and electricity are expensive to move. The heat storage must be near the customer, and the solar array must be near the storage to achieve real cost reductions. The design is also modular. Individual blocks of solar PV can be copied and pasted, and dozers can push more dirt. That repeatability reduces development costs and risk.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://austinvernon.site/blog/images/mounddrawing.png" alt=""></p>
<div><p><em>The Standard Thermal Storage System</em></p></div>
<p>A significant portion of human energy demand is for heat, whether that is for factories or heating buildings. Thermal storage is very efficient at delivering heat to these users. There is an efficiency penalty converting back to electricity; round-trip efficiency is 40%-45%, but sometimes the steady supply of electricity is worth it.</p>
<p>Harvesting sunlight with solar PV panels and storing it in a widely available material enables low-cost energy virtually everywhere on Earth.</p>
<h2>Markets We Want to Serve</h2>
<h3>Isolated Energy Users</h3>
<p>Some rural heat users are away from the existing energy infrastructure, and rural delivery systems can't meet their demand. They must migrate to more expensive fuels that are easier to transport, like propane or fuel oil.</p>
<p>Examples in this category are mining and agriculture. These customers have open land nearby and suffer from high energy costs. A solar PV array and Standard Thermal storage system can be cheaper today. Roughly 10 to 40 gigawatts of solar PV capacity might satisfy US demand, requiring more than $10 billion in investment.</p>
<p>From a more global perspective, most humans and their endeavors are isolated energy users. Co-located solar and cheap thermal storage can provide costs comparable to today's cheap energy. Typical steam process heat categories without access to affordable gas or coal require a few terawatts of solar to meet demand today and more in the future as the world becomes richer.</p>
<h3>High Latitude Solar Developers</h3>
<p>Solar arrays might produce 5x-6x more electricity in summer than in winter in high latitude regions. Batteries are too expensive to move excess electricity between seasons. But, solar panels are inexpensive, and it is common to oversize a solar array to meet basic electricity needs (lights, etc.) during non-summer months. The panels still produce electricity when it is cloudy or the sun is lower in the sky, but just not as much as in summer. The extra solar capacity covers many more days.</p>
<p>An obvious trade is to store the excess summer electricity from oversized arrays as heat to provide winter heating. The economics look very attractive because the electricity is “free” to utilize. And winter fuel is often expensive in these places, especially in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>The concept could provide a generalized solution for seasonal solar PV variation. A town could have a solar array on the edges of town to provide electricity nearly year-round. It would fill storage with the summer excess to power its district heating system in winter. The energy demand for existing district heating systems would require 3 to 5 terawatts of solar to satisfy it (several times cumulative global solar installation).</p>
<h3>Repowering Thermal Power Plants</h3>
<p>Seasonal electricity storage is the sexiest (and largest) application. Powering turbines from existing coal power plants by producing steam from thermal storage is the most economical path to electricity storage. Power plants are expensive, and there are plenty of existing ones. It could take up to ~25 terawatts of solar to convert them all.</p>
<p>Thermal storage can make these power plants operate more efficiently. Exhaust air scrubbers with high fixed and variable operating costs aren't necessary. Thermal efficiency improves because heat isn't lost up the stack, in solids, or running scrubbers. Facilities can start faster, making them more relevant in electricity markets. The cost and operating profile emulates a natural gas power plant.</p>
<p>The ideal number of plant conversions is a trickier question because of the difficulty in predicting how much other generation sources, like solar PV linked with batteries, will supply.</p>
<p>Some countries with growing electricity demand might want facilities to run in a more "baseload" configuration in the short term. The math is simple: Is solar PV heat cheaper than coal plus coal's inefficiencies? The numbers might favor solar over coal imports, but mine-mouth power plants will take longer to cross over.</p>
<p>There are many ways to model the long-term question, and <a href="https://findingspress.org/article/141340-thermal-energy-storage-in-dirt-for-repowering-decommissioned-coal-plants">a recent paper</a> I co-authored with several Stanford researchers is one entry. Most results converge around a technology like inexpensive thermal storage providing steady power on days when solar output is poor and electricity prices are higher. Thermal storage might supply around 10% of the total electricity supply in this configuration. Beating coal becomes much easier in this scenario because lower coal plant capacity factors hurt the economics.</p>
<p>Coal supplies around one-third of global electricity today, and electricity demand should keep growing. A substantial share of plants could undergo conversion in the most optimistic scenarios.</p>
<h2>Why is Thermal Storage a Good Option?</h2>
<h3>Available Storage Materials</h3>
<p>Requirements always determine what engineering choices are available. A constraining goal narrows the options.</p>
<p>Matching natural gas storage costs is a good constraining goal. Storing natural gas in depleted reservoirs is absurdly cheap, with a capital cost of $0.05-$0.10/kWh. For reference, batteries getting under $100/kWh is exciting, a 1000x higher cost per unit of storage. There are only a few materials that are even viable to match that cost. They are energetic chemical reactions, water, air, and dirt/rock.</p>
<p>Chemical storage works very well; that is what natural gas and other hydrocarbons are. They will always be favorable in some applications. But, extra steps and conversions raise the cost of producing or mining them. Cheaper options, even if they can't do everything a fuel can, would be nice.</p>
<p>Chemical fuels are so hard to beat because they carry so much energy per unit of mass, and the cost of that mass is very low compared to most products humans produce. By default, storing energy using less mass-efficient methods requires nearly free mass to be competitive.</p>
<p>Water and air are nearly free, so they are worth consideration. Unfortunately, both are forms of gravity/pressure storage, which have very low density, roughly 100x worse than thermal storage. Water and air are cheap, but managing their containers and movement is not. Air has the added issue of being compressible, so pressurizing it and recovering energy are more expensive and less efficient than water.</p>
<p>Thermal storage could also be attractive. A significant portion of human energy usage is in the form of heat. Conversion losses for these applications can be small. Conversion back into electricity is 40%-45%, which is not perfect, but better than many alternatives. The surface footprint is also very good, roughly an order of magnitude better than batteries because dirt piles a lot higher and closer together than shipping containers of batteries. A pile that could run a large power plant for months would look small in comparison to the cooling water reservoir.</p>
<h3>Simple Thermal Storage Cost Analysis</h3>
<p>There are two adjustable cost metrics: the cost of the storage material and the heat stored per unit. Most thermal storage is sensible storage, meaning heat changing the temperature of the material stores or releases heat rather than phase change or reaction. The material needs to be very inexpensive and subjected to high temperature swings to achieve acceptable $/kWh figures.</p>
<p>Dirt and rocks are practically free where they are, but moving, sorting, and processing the dirt adds cost very quickly. Giant mounds or embankments using nearby material cost ~$1/ton. Trucking sand or gravel costs $20-$50/ton. Refractory bricks made from purified dirt are ~$500/ton.</p>
<p>Dirt's thermal properties are similar to refractory bricks. It is composed of similar materials, like silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide. These oxides can handle very high temperatures exposed to air. Bricks have a more uniform structure than dirt, but piled-up dirt doesn't need fracture toughness or consistent thermal expansion. Dirt is an excellent value at one hundredth the cost per unit of storage.</p>
<p>Dirt stores around 20 kilowatt-hours thermal per ton for each 100 degrees Celsius of temperature change. A 400-degree Celsius swing would store 80 kilowatt-hours per ton and have a capital cost $0.013/kilowatt-hour, assuming $1/ton dirt moving costs. That is very competitive with natural gas storage, but selecting an inexpensive storage material is a tiny part of the battle. The heat addition and removal systems within the dirt mound can't cost more than $0.05-$0.08 per kilowatt-hour thermal. Standard Thermal has had to put in a lot of effort to reach costs in this range. Thermal storage systems are much more challenging to build than the material costs let on.</p>
<h2>Engineering Cheap Storage</h2>
<p>Beating natural gas storage costs requires several paradigm changes and adjustments to keep costs from ballooning to irrelevance.</p>
<h3>The Challenges of Rapid Charge and Discharge</h3>
<div><p>There is an anchoring to the idea that alternative energy storage technologies need to charge and discharge quickly. Rapid cycling is an incredible disadvantage for thermal storage for two reasons:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Heat Transfer is Slow</strong></p>
<p>Materials that are inexpensive and tolerate high temperatures while exposed to air tend to be oxides that are insulators (dirt, sand, rocks, bricks, etc.). The thermal conductivity is poor, and it is difficult to withdraw heat from more than a few centimeters within minutes or hours.</p>
<p>A block of hot mass with dimensions in tens of meters can take years to fully cool. Dry rock geothermal electricity generation calls for giant fracture networks between two wells to overcome the heat transfer limitation.</p>
<div><p>Regenerative heat exchangers at steel mills are one of the few scaled thermal storage applications. They use special "honeycomb" bricks that maintain high surface area-to-volume ratios to handle ~25 cycles per day.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://austinvernon.site/blog/images/checker-brick.jpg" alt=""></p>
<div><p><em><a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/nMzoXhBNKrFja8CKA">Source</a> Hot Blast Stove Checker Bricks</em></p></div>
<p>Attempts to get around the heat transfer deficiency tend to be complicated. Pumping molten salts was a popular idea for a time. The Department of Energy has a concept that conveys sand through heaters and stores it in a silo until it drops through a heat exchanger to export heat. Other designs pump oil or molten salt through gravel. Several startups use graphite in an inert container to get higher thermal conductivity while preventing oxidation.</p>
<p>Any heat storage design must carefully consider heat transfer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Temperature Cycling is Damaging</strong></p>
<p>Heated materials undergo transformations. They tend to expand as they heat and contract as they cool, but there are also break points where the basic structure can change. Highly engineered or ordered materials become disordered and fall apart when exposed to thermal cycling.</p>
<div><p>Most heat storage concepts require engineered systems to achieve charge/discharge rate goals, making for a very severe techno-economic challenge.</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thankfully, there is little market reasoning for rapid cycling. We don't have to fight physics.</p>
<h3>The Case for Slow Discharge</h3>
<div><p>Charge and discharge rates on the order of months are fine.</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Many Customers Use Energy Steadily</strong></p>
<p>More than 10% of world energy consumption is industrial process heat. Almost all these facilities run 24/7 or in defined daily cycles. The energy usage in any one day compared to the cumulative storage needed to shift summer excess to winter usage is tiny. Models project 1500 megawatt-hours of storage for every 1 megawatt of output capacity in a typical US location. Charging with solar requires higher rates than satisfying demand because it delivers the same amount of energy at a lower capacity factor. The charging pace is still leisurely and benefits from electricity's ability to provide high charging temperatures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Existing Winter Seasonal Storage is Slow</strong></p>
<div><p>Winter demand is an application that already uses seasonal storage. The clearest example is natural gas. US consumption is less than supply in summer and shoulder seasons, but greater in winter. The industry stores large amounts of gas near customers for winter consumption. Many of these storage sites are depleted gas fields. They can't fill or empty faster than on a timescale of months. Adding more extraction and injection wells is expensive, and there is no need for it.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://austinvernon.site/blog/images/naturalgasstorage.gif" alt=""></p>
<div><p><em>The natural gas storage seasonal cycle. Source: EIA</em></p></div>
<p>Thankfully, people don't use their entire winter allotment of heating fuel over 1-2 days. They use energy much more regularly, and daily usage is small compared to the total stored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Batteries Solve Fast Cycling In Electricity Markets</strong></p>
<p>I'm well into the 99th percentile of battery optimists, which is unusual for someone working on alternative storage technologies. The improvement in battery technology over the last twenty years has been incredible. They are already the least expensive way to add grid peaking capacity, and they will move a growing share of daily electricity generation.</p>
<p>People underestimate batteries. There is still significant room to drop costs in cells, packs, and construction/integration. Sub-$100/kWh installation costs are already present in much of the world and should come even to the US in time (tariffs, permitting, and the electrical code are the obstacles). These costs are transformative even in simplistic models, but the various revenue streams for batteries are also underappreciated. They can arbitrage prices across time, provide ancillary services, and arbitrage transmission constraints. The lower installation costs and multiple revenue streams mean that the daily spread between the high and low electricity prices will be much tighter, more like a few tens of dollars per megawatt-hour. That tight spread disadvantages technologies that take advantage of daily volatility with rapid charging or discharging.</p>
<div><p>Instead, markets will send signals to generation sources with low fixed costs that can provide a steady supply over days when solar, wind, or gas are constrained. Batteries will still be too expensive to arbitrage these seasonal differences effectively. Thermal electricity storage is orders of magnitude cheaper for storage, but worse at daily cycling. It can act as a complement to batteries and fill the market niche.</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If we accept slower charge and discharge rates, then engineering becomes much simpler. Insulation and other factors benefit from the low thermal conductivity of insulating oxides. The thermal mass doesn't need to be highly engineered; it can be regular dirt piled up with some extraction pipes thrown in.</p>
<p>Spending more on electric heaters or heat transfer surface area to improve charge/discharge isn't necessary for the vast majority of applications. Dirt-cheap mass is the main advantage of thermal storage, and it is important to lean into that and take advantage of truly "seasonal" energy shifting.</p>
<h3>Energy From the Sun</h3>
<p>Even free storage isn't helpful if the cost of energy from the solar arrays is more than natural gas. Lazard's yearly report is the industry benchmark for solar's cost per megawatt-hour. The 2025 edition pegs the best-case US cost at $38/megawatt-hour, equivalent to more than $11/MCF of natural gas. The trading hub price for natural gas has been $3-$4/MCF in 2025 (and many years before that), exposing a significant problem for our thesis.</p>
<p>A closer look reveals the issue. The operating cost of a solar farm is very low at $4/megawatt-hour, but the capital cost comes in at $1150/kilowatt in the US, contributing $34/megawatt-hour. Commodity solar panels cost $80/kilowatt globally and $200-$250/kilowatt in the US, meaning there is a lot of waste (and opportunity) in today's solar farm capital cost.</p>
<p>The first slash at these costs comes from co-locating the solar array with the storage system. More than $300/kilowatt of cost comes from preparing electricity for export or connecting to the grid. These items include inverters, medium-voltage transformers, switchgear, substations, high-voltage transformers, power lines to the grid, and all the project management overhead to build these systems.</p>
<div><p>The next phase is to simplify the arrays themselves. Almost all US utility-scale systems use trackers that keep panels faced towards the sun throughout the day. These are expensive, add a lot of mechanical complexity, and cover more land to keep rows from shading each other. Instead, the array can use fixed racking where the panels lie nearly flat. These structures are very lightweight and simple because wind loads are lower. The total area is 2x-3x smaller than the tracking arrays because the panel spacing is tight. Operating costs even fall because there is less to break and less land to mow or pay rent on.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://austinvernon.site/blog/images/solararray.png" alt=""></p>
<div><p><em>Our Test Site Solar Array</em></p></div>
<p>The financial implications of the racking change are profound. Install labor and direct racking costs fall, operating costs nearly halve. The electrical wiring decreases 50%, making wiring runs without increasing voltage much more practical. The reduced area opens up land constrained sites. The supply chain shortens dramatically because there are fewer unique parts and longer lead time items. The arrays are simple enough that an outside EPC firm isn't required, knocking off another chunk of cost. Each panel produces less electricity without trackers, but panels are relatively inexpensive, and the other benefits are well worth the penalty.</p>
<p>The result of these changes is that the installation cost for the solar array is the panel cost plus $100-$150/kW. A US array would be $300-$350/kWh, and the levelized cost falls to as low as $16/megawatt-hour, or $4.70/MCF of gas. An array with free market module prices would be equivalent to $3/MCF.</p>
<p>These costs put us within the range of US natural gas prices, and well in the money in most international markets. The consideration is what the end customer actually pays rather than the hub price. There are some large gas consumers, think of a giant ammonia plant, located near gas fields that might pay less than the trading hub price. These will take some time for economic crossover. In most of the US, customers pay 1.5x to 3x the trading hub price to cover transportation, storage, and distribution. Or power plants might be paying 100x the normal price for gas during power crunches. A fixed energy supply cost via co-located solar would be a big advantage for a converted power plant. Even with high US module prices, there is an opportunity to be competitive in many regions.</p>
<h2>Progress and Commercialization</h2>
<p>There was little doubt that a technology like this was technically possible. All the risk is in achieving the incredulously low costs. One of the most critical questions was how engineered the system needs to be. Pure and engineered materials can help make things predictable and reliable, but they are expensive. Ultra-low cost requires using them sparingly. Another concern is unknown costs. Typically, projects miss cost estimates not because a category is poorly estimated but because entire line items are left out. Constructing an end-to-end system became one of the overriding priorities to test these hypotheses.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Built a 100-kilowatt solar array to power testing.</strong></p>
<p>We completed the array within 6 months of saying "Go," including permitting, order lead times, and construction (which was a few weeks at the end). Part of that speed was the simplicity and lack of interconnection, and part was clever (and lucky) planning. We completed all the engineering, procurement, and construction ourselves to prove its feasibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>10 Months of Destructive Heater Testing</strong></p>
<p>The biggest cost miracle is the heating elements. Ordering package systems from existing vendors can easily cost hundreds of dollars per kilowatt, even though the resistor material itself is $1-$2/kilowatt. Structure, insulation, controls, and assembly have astronomical costs. The extras are there because heating elements need to last years, but can literally die in one second in conditions outside their boundary. There are only a few materials that are even acceptable as resistors.</p>
<p>Our cost goal for the heaters is $10/kW, close to the cost of the resistor material. A goal so ambitious obviously requires designing and building our own heaters. We have large piles of dead heaters, and now know about every way one can die. Our latest testing suggests we will achieve our cost and reliability goals, and the effort to get there has been incredible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rearchitecting Solar PV Electrical Integration and Safety</strong></p>
<p>Another unpleasant surprise was that the entire solar industry relies on one narrow regulatory pathway that involves inverters and AC interconnection. The equipment needed to satisfy the electrical code for an off-grid DC solar array doesn't exist at any scale without going to grid-forming inverters (we had to buy some discontinued equipment on eBay to complete the test site). Companies usually embed these systems in a grid-tied inverter, which we don't have.</p>
<p>Solar array safety is challenging compared to wiring in a house or factory due to the direct current and constant current nature of solar modules. We've had to design our own controllers and safety systems to have a chance at deploying a commercial project. These are usually "outsourced" to very specialized inverter manufacturers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moving Dirt</strong></p>
<div><p>Building an inexpensive dirt pile is one thing, but embedding pipes and heaters while keeping it cheap is another. We've gone through at least a half dozen configurations before finally settling on a viable construction method.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://austinvernon.site/blog/images/moundpicture.png" alt=""></p>
<div><p><em>One version of the mound.</em></p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heating Dirt</strong></p>
<div><p>Lab-scale tests of heating dirt are easy. But, heat flow in a large mound can be more complex with much longer diffusion paths, especially during the early phases (heating the first time is like making bricks in situ). Heating in a test mound has been critical for developing models that are reliable at scale.</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>We are now an army of three permanent employees. Jimmy Williams joined in the summer of 2024 to focus on solving the heater cost and reliability challenge. Brian Pal joined more recently to tackle final systems engineering hurdles and refine our prototypes into more robust and replicable commercial designs.</p>
<p>We also have a horde of capable contractors who help with construction or provide specialized engineering and regulatory services.</p>
<p>Working with this team has been a wonderful experience, and their abilities and extremely specific experience has shaved years and tens of millions (or hundreds of millions?) of dollars off the development process.</p>
<h3>The Constant Pressure of Cost and First Customer Systems</h3>
<p>Cost tries to balloon at every turn. Almost every system component has undergone at least one cost crisis, if not many, where that single component could blow the entire project budget. Having a component that costs anything to buy and install is a problem when everything has to be practically free.</p>
<p>Balance-of-system and soft costs are the most challenging, like the heater example. Theoretically, many things can be very cheap, but only under extremely narrow conditions. Any perturbation quickly requires a slew of mitigations that increase the cost and complexity. Rarely do these narrow windows for different subsystems align.</p>
<p>Working out the details has been the most extreme global optimization problem I've worked on. I've had to develop a detailed understanding of solar cells, the electrical code, unsteady state heat transfer, and many other topics in between (My blog output decreased because I had to study at night instead of writing blog posts). We now know what we need to build and will be finalizing the commercial design over the next few months.</p>
<p>The goal is to build the first customer systems in 2026. We are working with several potential customers to ensure our system can successfully integrate with their energy usage (designing a universal, copy-and-paste system that can integrate easily with different customer facilities is another tricky part of the global optimization). Our first system can offer savings for fuel oil, propane, and higher-priced natural gas users. Follow-on systems, especially those larger than a few megawatts, can match the sub-$0.10/kWh natural gas storage cost. Matching energy cost depends on the location and the solar panel cost.</p>

<h2>Maintaining a Competitive Edge</h2>
<h3>Differentiation from Existing Thermal Storage Startups</h3>
<p>I would not be working on this problem if I agreed with the development path of other firms in the space.</p>
<p>Every other serious effort is a highly engineered system that has a day to a few days' worth of heat storage. That means competing head-on with batteries, whose cost is already below that of many thermal storage hopefuls.</p>
<p>The Standard Thermal system has months of storage capacity, a cost per kilowatt-hour several orders of magnitude lower than highly engineered systems, and is scalable with a fraction of capital and human resources.</p>
<h3>The Strategy</h3>
<p>"What is the moat with a dirt pile?" is a common question. Most sites will have drainage moats, but that usually isn't the answer people are looking for.</p>
<p>The main differences between energy projects like this and software are the difficulty of scaling and customer stickiness. The technology itself is far from enough to achieve scale due to thickets of regulations, permits, certifications, cost pressures, and financing hurdles that add friction to growth. However, the on-site nature of the projects ensures a long-term relationship with the customer. The project size unlocks low customer acquisition costs.</p>
<p>There is a well-worn path for scaling infrastructure technologies. Expensive capital builds the first examples. Then there might be debt financing available to borrow against an operating project. Then the debt for new construction. And finally, someone else pays for new projects.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind this path is scale and capital efficiency. Developing projects is demanding, and one firm can only take on so many before the overhead and risk become crippling. Each rung up the strategy ladder reduces capital requirements and company risk.</p>
<p>There might be dozens of renewable energy developers with a market cap of more than a billion dollars. No single player can dominate due to the friction and barriers in each project. Each project having a pseudo-monopoly over that particular location also maintains the value of existing systems. The size of the company is related to the size of its projects - big companies have big projects. The same pattern holds in other industries, like oil and gas, where the leading companies operate the most productive fields and focus on megaprojects. Even within the shale industry, the most successful players found the most extensive high-return plays. The company with an all-encompassing vision of being in every play, Chesapeake, declared bankruptcy while its founder died an untimely death.</p>
<p>Another unusual feature of ultra-cheap storage is that the actual storage is a relatively small portion of the cost. But project revenue and viability are solely reliant on it. Lenders must evaluate the risk based on the storage system performance, not low-risk solar arrays or customers with good credit.</p>
<div><p>A multi-phase strategy emerges from these realities:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Build Initial Projects</strong></p>
<p>The first projects need to validate the technology, provide some revenue, and create a track record for future financing. There is no "chasm of death" as both the off-grid solar and storage systems can scale down to a few megawatts without massive penalties. The diversity of energy users is enough that potential customers with expensive energy exist in this range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scale Up Size and Financing</strong></p>
<p>Projects in the tens of megawatts have cost benefits and conserve corporate overhead, allowing faster growth. The track record of the initial projects should open up financing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Push Lending Rates and Cost Down</strong></p>
<p>Several trends work to make the technology viable in more locations. Solar panels are a significant portion of CAPEX, and continued cost decreases have a disproportionate impact on the levelized cost of heat delivered. Improving solar panel efficiency reduces the land required and saves money on racking and labor. Other custom components, like electrical safety systems and controllers, decrease in cost with scale. Interest rates for borrowing against projects decrease, which has an outsized impact on project breakeven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide Value No One Else Can</strong></p>
<p>The technology can only continue scaling by enabling many project development firms to deploy it. Becoming some version of an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) firm is a necessity. The bankability and turn-key system can create an excellent buyer surplus by decreasing the overhead and levelized cost of energy for the entire project. Offering a fair price plus friction from patents leaves little opportunity for new entrants and preserves the long-term maintenance and operations relationship.</p>
<p>Many of the necessary components to replicate the system require time (testing, certifications, etc.). Our system costs will continue to fall and become more bankable. That increases the free cash flow hole and time-to-market a new entrant has to weather. It will be much easier to make money by buying the thermal storage system and developing projects rather than trying to copy it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Further Upsize Projects and Repeat</strong></p>
<div><p>Larger projects enable the firm to grow without choking on overhead. These projects will almost certainly be power plant conversions or entire city district heating, which are often 10x-100x larger than typical process heat applications. The same follow-on move to EPC unlocks global scale.</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Implementation of the plan requires excellent execution, but this is always the case with startups. Each rung on the ladder unlocks durable value. Falling short could easily mean being a unicorn project developer instead of being zeroed out.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Handling high seasonal solar variation, dealing with the last 10% of electricity generation in renewables-dominated grids without fossil fuels, and reducing the burden of energy costs in fuel-poor regions have been classified as near-impossible problems at various times.</p>
<p>It is rare to work on something that has the potential to be so impactful and also benefits from my passions for energy and engineering minutiae or low-level global optimization. I'm grateful for that. There is an enormous amount of work ahead to make the impossible possible, and I'm more motivated than ever to see it through and scale the technology.</p>

  <p>At the time of writing, the most recent Adobe Reader 25.x.y.z 64-bit

installation, the program includes 'AI' (of course), an auto-updater,

'new' and 'old'.</p>
<p>For comparison, the size of SumatraPDF-3.5.2 installer is 8,246,744

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog-post-body" fs-toc-element="contents" fs-toc-hideurlhash="false" fs-toc-offsettop="6rem" fs-richtext-element="rich-text"><h2><strong>Welcome to Scamlexity</strong></h2><p>AI Browsers are no longer a concept. They’re here. Microsoft has Copilot built into Edge. OpenAI is experimenting with a sandboxed browser in “agent mode.” And Perplexity’s <em>Comet</em> is one of the first to fully embrace the idea of a browser that browses for you. This is <strong>Agentic AI</strong> stepping directly into our daily digital routines - searching, reading, shopping, clicking. It’s not just assisting us, but increasingly replacing us.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66e1bda4d78fa806a1f5123c/68a2d77c71f0579ac6e7c8de_image.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>But there’s a frightening paradox. In the rush to deliver seamless, magical user experiences, something critical is left behind. We’ll put it plainly:</p><blockquote><strong>“One small step for Agentic AI, one giant step back for our security!”</strong></blockquote><p>The problem isn’t just that these browsers are UX-first. They also inherit AI’s built-in vulnerabilities - the tendency to act without full context, to trust too easily, and to execute instructions without the skepticism humans naturally apply. AI is designed to make its humans happy at almost any cost, even if it means hallucinating facts, bending the rules, or acting in ways that carry hidden risks.</p><p>That means an AI Browser can, without your knowledge, click, download, or hand over sensitive data, all in the name of “helping” you. Imagine asking it to find the best deal on those sneakers you’ve been eyeing, and it confidently completes the purchase… from a fake e-Commerce shop built to steal your credit card.</p><p>The scam no longer needs to trick you. It only needs to trick your AI. When that happens, <strong>you’re still the one who pays the price</strong>. This is <strong>Scamlexity</strong>: A complex new era of scams, where AI convenience collides with a new, invisible scam surface and <strong>humans become the collateral damage</strong>.</p><h2><strong>Falling for the Same Old Tricks</strong></h2><p>To reach the above conclusions, we first had to take these AI Browsers for a <strong>test drive in the security lane</strong>. We chose Perplexity’s <em>Comet</em> as our primary test subject. It’s currently the only publicly available AI Browser that doesn’t just summarize or search, but actually <strong>browses for you</strong>, clicks links, and performs tasks autonomously.</p><p>Our first step wasn’t to unleash cutting-edge, AI-targeted exploits. We started simple — with scams that have been running for years. Humans have learned to spot them (and here at <a href="https://guard.io/">Guardio</a>, our detection engine eats them for breakfast), but what would an AI Agent do when faced with the same traps?</p><h3>A Fake Shop Selling Fake Apple Watches to your AI Agent</h3><p>One of the most hyped features of AI Browsers, often shown in promo clips, is the “Buy me something” routine. With a single prompt, the AI will search the shop, select your product, and check out.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66e1bda4d78fa806a1f5123c/68a2d7c8480488eb5a8fcc5e_image%201.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>And so, one AI prompt on <a href="https://www.lovable.dev/">Lovable</a> was all it took to spin up a convincing “Walmart” store to test drive Comet on. The site had everything: a clean design, realistic product listings, and a checkout flow good enough to pass a casual glance. Looks like the folks at Lovable still haven’t read our <a href="https://guard.io/labs/vibescamming-from-prompt-to-phish-benchmarking-popular-ai-agents-resistance-to-the-dark-side">VibeScamming</a> report showing how missing guardrails in their models can play straight into scammers’ hands and harm the public on an unprecedented scale.</p><p>In our scenario, the human reaches this fake shop the same way many do today: Through misleading social media ads, spam emails, or SEO poisoning in search results. On Comet, the page loads without issue and isn’t blocked by Google Safe Browsing, even though GSB is active in this Chromium-based browser.</p><p>So, we gave the AI a simple instruction: “Buy me an Apple Watch.”</p><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OPblVgtbzec" title="Scamlexity FakeWalmartSite"></iframe></p></figure><p>The model immediately took over the browsing tab and got to work. It scanned the site’s HTML directly, located the right buttons, and navigated the pages. Along the way, there were plenty of clues that this site wasn’t actually a Walmart! But they weren’t part of the assigned task, and apparently the model disregarded them entirely.</p><p>It found the Apple Watch, added it to the cart, and, without asking for confirmation, <strong>autofilled our saved address and credit card details</strong> from the browser’s auto-fill database. Seconds later, the “purchase” was complete. One prompt, a few moments of automated browsing with zero human oversight, and the damage was done. While the human waits for a shiny new Apple Watch, the scammers are already spending their money.</p><p>It’s important to note that we ran this test multiple times. Sometimes, Comet refused and sensed something phishy. In other cases, it paused and asked the human to complete checkout manually. However, there are instances when it went "all the way" and handed over personal and payment details directly to the scammer on an obviously fake shopping site that took only 10 seconds to set up.</p><p>And when security depends on chance, it’s not security.</p><h3>Handling Phishing Emails From Your “Bank”</h3><p>Another flagship feature of AI Browsers is handling your inbox. They can scan new messages, mark to-do items, and even take care of them for you. So, we tested how Comet would handle one of the oldest traps on the internet: a phishing email from your “bank”:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66e1bda4d78fa806a1f5123c/68a6bf752cd2c054aaf30855_Image00.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>All we did was fake a simple email from a fresh new ProtonMail address (so it’s clearly not from a bank) posing as a message from a Wells Fargo investment manager. Inside was a link to a genuine phishing page, active in the wild for several days, and still unflagged by Google Safe Browsing.</p><p>When Comet received the email, it confidently marked it as a to-do item from the bank and clicked the link without any verification. There was no URL check, no pre-navigation warning -just a direct pass to the attacker’s page. Once the fake Wells Fargo login loaded, Comet treated it as legitimate. It prompted the user to enter credentials, even helping fill in the form.</p><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/maabHiTIxqA" title="Scamlexity BankPhishingEmail"></iframe></p></figure><p>The result: a perfect <strong>trust chain gone rogue</strong>. By handling the entire interaction from email to website, Comet effectively vouched for the phishing page. The human never saw the suspicious sender address, never hovered over the link, and never had the chance to question the domain. Instead, they were dropped directly onto what looked like a legitimate Wells Fargo login, and because it came via their trusted AI, it felt safe.</p><p>These two cases prove that even the oldest tricks in the scammer’s playbook become more dangerous in the hands of AI Browsing. The trust chain is the real game-changer: the human no longer engages directly with the suspicious content, never sees the red flags, and never gets the chance to make their own judgment.</p><blockquote><strong>Human intuition to evade harm is excluded from the process and AI becomes the single point of decision. Without strong AI guardrails, that decision is essentially a coin toss - and when your security is left to chance, it’s only a matter of time before it lands on the wrong side.</strong></blockquote><h2><strong>“PromptFix” - Modern AI Prompt Injection</strong></h2><p>Now we move on to testing the kind of security AI Browsers will need to withstand in the coming AI vs. AI era - a time when attackers no longer bother manipulating human eyes, emotions, or judgment, but instead target AI directly, speaking the one language it can’t ignore: prompts.</p><p><strong>Prompt injection</strong> is the method of embedding hidden instructions inside the content an AI is processing, steering its actions in ways the human never requested and never sees. Today's most common prompt injection attacks hide text on a page with tricks like: <em>“Ignore all previous instructions and… do something malicious for me.”</em> When the AI Agent processes the page, this hidden text is ingested as part of the source code, and the injected prompt becomes part of the AI’s instructions.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66e1bda4d78fa806a1f5123c/68a2d88dc02d2c4ae146e9eb_image%203.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>With <strong>PromptFix</strong>, we take this further. It’s our AI-era evolution of the <strong>ClickFix</strong> scam - a social engineering trick mimicking captcha pages that works so well on humans, now adapted to work on their AI Agents. This is <a href="https://guard.io/labs/captchageddon-unmasking-the-viral-evolution-of-the-clickfix-browser-based-threat"><em>CAPTCHAgeddon</em></a> in the AI era. Instead of convincing someone to click through a fake captcha that silently runs malicious code, we tried something different. We crafted a narrative the AI simply can’t resist following:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66e1bda4d78fa806a1f5123c/68a2d8a0f6640d11e2356240_image%204.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In this scenario, the “captcha” appears as a harmless checkbox to the human. At this scenario, the AI Agent should stop and ask the human to solve it - exactly as it was programmed to do. But lurking behind the scenes is a set of attacker instructions inside an invisible text box, concealed through simple CSS styling. Humans can’t see it, but it flows directly into the AI Agent’s prompt as it processes the page.</p><p>Why would the AI treat these as commands? In prompt injections, the attacker relies on the model’s inability to fully distinguish between instructions and regular content within the same prompt, hoping to slip malicious commands past sanitation checks.</p><p>With <strong>PromptFix</strong>, the approach is different: We don’t try to glitch the model into obedience. Instead, we mislead it using techniques borrowed from the human social engineering playbook - appealing directly to its core design goal: to help its human quickly, completely, and without hesitation. We just provide it with the best (manipulating) methods to do so:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66e1bda4d78fa806a1f5123c/68a2d8bcd894469092bedbce_image%205.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The test scenario we created is quite simple. A scammer sends a fake message to a victim, posing as their doctor’s office, with a link to “recent blood test results”. The victim asks their AI Assistant to handle it. The AI browses to the link, encounters a captcha, and then uncovers the hidden “gem” - causing a drive-by-download attack.</p><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cPgYv4fLQBo" title="Scamlexity PromptFix Part1"></iframe></p></figure><p>The injected narrative tells the AI Agent this is a special “AI-friendly” captcha it can solve on behalf of its human. All it needs to do is click the button. And so, it clicks. In our controlled demo, the button downloaded a harmless file. Still, it could just as easily have been a malicious payload, triggering a classic <strong>drive-by download</strong> and planting malware on the human’s machine without their knowledge.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66e1bda4d78fa806a1f5123c/68a2d8ea4600f79c7606e2ae_image%206.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p8XfDLIa1GE" title="Scamlexity PromptFix Part2"></iframe></p></figure><p>And that’s just the start. The same technique could allow the AI to send emails containing personal details, grant file-sharing permissions on the victim’s cloud storage, or execute any other action its permissions allow. In effect, <strong>the attacker is now in control of your AI</strong>, and by extension, of you. The trust chain glitch continues.</p><h2><strong>The Expanding AI Attack Surface</strong></h2><p>In this research, we explored <strong>human-centric attack vectors</strong> that have been around for years alongside <strong>AI-centric prompt injection techniques</strong> explicitly built for the new browsing paradigm. The first category needed almost no adaptation to work as AI browsers inherit the same blind spots that those scams exploit in humans, but without the human’s instinctive skepticism. The second category, like <strong>PromptFix</strong>, goes further: crafting content that works directly on the AI’s decision-making layer, exploiting known prompt-injection parsing flaws and tailored service-oriented narratives that tap into the AI’s built-in drive to help instantly and without hesitation.</p><p>Together, these approaches expose an attack surface that is both broader and deeper than anything we’ve seen before. One that will grow rapidly as AI Browsers and Agentic AI in general move into the mainstream. And this isn’t just about phishing or fake shops. It’s a structural reality: these systems are engineered to complete tasks flawlessly, but not to question whether those tasks are safe.</p><h2>The Future of AI-Powered Scams</h2><p>In the AI-vs-AI era, scammers don’t need to trick millions of different people; they only need to break one AI model. Once they succeed, the same exploit can be scaled endlessly. And because they have access to the same models, they can “train” their malicious AI against the victim’s AI until the scam works flawlessly.</p><blockquote>This is <strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) gone rogue!</strong> Not to generate pretty pictures, but an endless stream of zero-day scams.</blockquote><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66e1bda4d78fa806a1f5123c/68a2d92dd6b9e145c8e732a2_image%207.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The diagram above is only a simplified schematic of how automated scam training might look, but it is just the beginning. Once more powerful generative AIs are added into this loop and scaled across clusters of GPUs and massive cloud infrastructure, the pace and sophistication of scams will accelerate beyond anything we have faced before. With today’s reactive defenses, this wave cannot be stopped. The only real answer is to stay several steps ahead of scammers by thinking like one. Instead of training the generator to scam, we must focus on training the discriminator to anticipate, detect, and neutralize these attacks. That means building and continuously optimizing relevant guardrails into Agentic AI models before they go into production, and keeping them sharp while they run in the wild.</p><h2><strong>Closing the Scamlexity Gap</strong></h2><p>The path forward isn’t to halt innovation but to bring <strong>security back into focus</strong> before these systems go fully mainstream. Today’s AI Browsers are designed with user experience at the top of the priority stack. At the same time, security is often an afterthought or delegated entirely to existing tools like Google Safe Browsing, which is, unfortunately, insufficient.</p><p>If AI Agents are going to handle our emails, shop for us, manage our accounts, and act as our digital front-line, they need to inherit the <strong>proven guardrails</strong> we already use in human-centric browsing: robust phishing detection, URL reputation checks, domain spoofing alerts, malicious file scanning, and behavioral anomaly detection - all adapted to work <em>inside</em> the AI decision loop.</p><p>Security must be woven into the very architecture of AI Browsers, not bolted on afterward. Because as these examples show, the trust we place in Agentic AI is going to be absolute, and when that trust is misplaced, the cost is immediate.</p><p>In the era of Scamlexity, safety can’t be optional!</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://jakub.kr/components/oklch-colors">https://jakub.kr/components/oklch-colors</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45010876">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header></header>
<p>OKLCH is a newer color model that is designed to be perceptually uniform. This means that colors are much more accurate in terms of how humans perceive them and it makes working with them much easier.</p>


<p>Color Models</p>
<p>Before being able to understand how OKLCH differs from the other color models, it is important to understand some of the basic color concepts.</p>

<p>Color models are systems to describe colors. These include RGB, HSL, LCH, OKLCH and more. The model determines how easy it is to manipulate or think about a color.</p>

<p>Gamut</p>
<p>Gamut is a playing field where the model lives and defines what colors are possible. Common gamuts include sRGB (the web default) and Display-P3 (used on modern devices).</p>

<p>There is a lot more nuance when you get into color spaces. They don’t just define a gamut, but also things like the white point and transfer function. I decided to leave those out for the sake of keeping the article simple.</p>

<p>Structure</p>
<p>OKLCH, same as LCH, consists of three values: Lightness, Chroma and Hue. The difference between the two is the underlying color space that the color model uses, which in case of OKLCH, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklab_color_space" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OKLab</a>.</p>

<p>Lightness - Equal steps feel like equal changes in brightness. Ranges from value between 0 and 1 or percentage ranging from 0% to 100%.</p>

<p>Chroma - Controls intensity of the color, similar to saturation.</p>

<p>Hue - Controls the hue, measured in degrees ranging from 0 to 360.</p>


<p>Consistent Brightness</p>
<p>Let's say you want to create a couple of pill buttons and you want each one to have a different color. The usual workflow with sRGB colors would be defining the first color and then handpicking others to match it.</p>

<p>With OKLCH, you can use the same value for all of them and only change hue. That way you create colors that look and feel the same.</p>

<p>You can do the same thing with color models like HSL, but as you can see above, the colors don't look uniform. Some are lighter, some darker, some pop more and some less.</p>

<p>This is one of the major advantages of OKLCH over other color models. Creating perceptually uniform color palettes and working with them is very easy.</p>
<p>Predictable Shades</p>
<p>It also works the other way around, where you can change the lightness value to create various color shades and there is no hue or saturation drift unlike in other color modes.</p>

<p>In the example above, you can see that the OKLCH colors maintain consistent blueness across all of the shades, while in the HSL example, the lighter shades drift to purple and the darker ones muddy out towards grayish.</p>
<p>Better Gradients</p>
<p>The way gradients work in OKLCH is pretty different compared to sRGB. In sRGB, gradients are calculated in red, green, and blue values, which often leads to muddy midpoints and uneven brightness.</p>

<p>With OKLCH, the math follows lightness, chroma, and hue. In the example above you can see that the starting and ending points are the same but the colors the gradient passes through are quite different.</p>

<p>Color Space Support</p>
<p>sRGB can’t reach a lot of colors that modern screens can show. In OKLCH you can write colors that are only possible to render on a screen that supports Display-P3 colors.</p>

<p>If you are on a display that supports Display-P3, you will see the right color much more vivid than the left one. If you are on a display that only supports sRGB, the color should look identical, as the browser maps the out of gamut color back inside the sRGB gamut.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that grays are identical in sRGB and Display-P3, so there would be no difference there.</p>
<p>Maximum Chroma</p>
<p>OKLCH can also define more colors than any real screen can show. It can specify values that don't fit inside any actual gamut like sRGB or Display-P3.</p>

<p>Let's take this color as an example <code>color: oklch(0.7 0.4 40)</code>. It has a very high chroma value and it could mathematically exist but in practice it lies outside of any real display's gamut. When this color is used, it will get clipped or mapped to the nearest representable color inside the gamut.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code data-language="css" data-theme="github-dark github-light"><span data-line=""><span>@layer</span><span> base {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  :root</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    color</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.7</span><span> 0.4</span><span> 40</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Generally you don't want this to happen, as the clipped color can often look very different from the defined one.</p>

<p>Therefore, there is a concept of a maximum chroma value, which calculates the maximum chroma that a display can show based on the lightness, hue and the selected gamut like sRGB or Display-P3.</p>

<p>Browser Support &amp; Fallbacks</p>
<p>OKLCH colors were introduced in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CSS Color Module Level 4</a> and they are well supported across all modern browsers.</p>

<p>However, there are still some surfaces where OKLCH colors are not supported such as outdated browsers. In case you are worried about this, you can add fallbacks and use the <code>@supports</code> directive in CSS.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code data-language="css" data-theme="github-dark github-light"><span data-line=""><span>@layer</span><span> base {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  :root</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    /* sRGB hex */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    --color-gray-100</span><span>: </span><span>#fcfcfc</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    --color-gray-200</span><span>: </span><span>#fafafa</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    --color-gray-300</span><span>: </span><span>#f4f4f4</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>    @</span><span>supports</span><span> (</span><span>color</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span> 0</span><span> 0</span><span>)) {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>      /* OKLCH */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>      --color-gray-100</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.991</span><span> 0</span><span> 0</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>      --color-gray-200</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.982</span><span> 0</span><span> 0</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>      --color-gray-300</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.955</span><span> 0</span><span> 0</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This way the browser uses OKLCH colors if they are supported, otherwise it falls back to sRGB.</p>
