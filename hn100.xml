            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://edwardbenson.com/2024/10/google-ai-thinks-i-left-gatorade-on-the-moon">https://edwardbenson.com/2024/10/google-ai-thinks-i-left-gatorade-on-the-moon</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41761497">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article>
<p>Google's <a href="https://notebooklm.google/">NotebookLLM</a> is the first AI podcast I'd actually listen to.
Give it a web page or document, and it will generate you a podcast about it.</p>
<p>It's really good. But it's also really easy to trick.</p>
<p>So I modified my website to lie to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a human visits <a href="https://edwardbenson.com/">my homepage</a>, they see a regular page about me.</li>
<li>When Google's AI visits my homepage, it sees fake producer's show notes for an episode about me flying to the moon on my bike with balloons and a scuba tank.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://edwardbenson.com/images/homepage-trick.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The result is pretty hilarious -- have a listen to the true history of the US Space Program:</p>
<audio controls="">
  <source type="audio/mp3" src="https://edwardbenson.com/moonwalk.mp3">
  <p>Your browser does not support the audio element.</p>
</audio>
<h2>More Seriously..</h2>
<p>If it's this easy to detect an AI and provide it a "special" set of facts, you'd better believe people are already doing it all over the web.</p>
<p>The attack vector is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, acquire a web page that ranks highly for a particular term.</li>
<li>Next, plant an "AI Only" version of the content, hidden to humans, designed to bias how the AI thinks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, when the AI searches the web to assist with an answer, it won't just find lies, but weaponized lies: content designed specifically for LLM manipulation.</p>
<p>So next time you ask your LLM of choice for advice on something, and you notice it's searching the web to prepare an answer, be aware that its response is potentially compromised by tactics like this - even if you can't see them with your own eyes when you check the sources.</p>
<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<p><strong>Steering the LLM</strong></p>
<p>I'd <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1fr31h8/comment/lpj6uef/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">read that</a> NotebookLLM was easy to steer by feeding it fake "producer show notes", so that's how I typed my fake story.</p>
<p><a href="https://edwardbenson.com/moon-goof">Here is a copy in full</a>.</p>
<p>I did no edits and only a single generation, and it followed my beat sheet <strong>exactly</strong>, so I'd say that was 10/10 steerability.</p>
<p><strong>Tricking the Scraper Bot</strong></p>
<p>You can upload a documents with fake show notes straight to NotebookLLM's website, so if you're making silly podcast episodes for your kids, that's the best way to do it.</p>
<p>But if you want to trick Google's bot on your website, just detect the <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers">GoogleOther</a> user agent in your request headers and then serve your "special" data instead of the real website.</p>
<p>Here's an <a href="https://github.com/eob/isai">NPM package called <code>isai</code></a> I scraped together to make this simple. It's based on <a href="https://npmjs.com/isbot">isbot</a>. When rendering your page, just say:</p>
<pre><code>import { isai } from "isai";

if (isai(request.headers.get("User-Agent"))) {
  // Return web page just for AI consumption
} else {
  // Return web page for human consumption
}
</code></pre>
<p>Warning that <code>GoogleOther</code> is not exclusive to NotebookLLM; it appears to be used for a variety of non-production Google products, so doing this risks seeding other Google properties with bad data about you. For this reason, I took down the moon story from my actual homepage for <code>GoogleOther</code> agents.</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/rust-needs-a-web-framework-for-lazy-developers/">https://ntietz.com/blog/rust-needs-a-web-framework-for-lazy-developers/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41760421">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I like to make silly things, and I also like to put in <em>minimal effort</em> for those silly things.
I also like to make things in Rust, mostly for the web, and this is where we run into a problem.</p>
<p>See, if I want to make something for the web, I could use Django but I don't want that.
I mean, Django is for building <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2023/09/07/culture/threads-inside-story-metas-newest-social-app/">serious businesses</a>, not for building silly non-commercial things!
But using Rust, we have to do a <em>lot</em> more work than if we build it with Django or friends.</p>
<p>See, so far, there's no equivalent, and the Rust community leans heavily into the "wire it up yourself" approach.
As <a href="https://www.arewewebyet.org/">Are We Web Yet?</a> says, "[...] you generally have to wire everything up yourself. Expect to put in a little bit of extra set up work to get started."</p>
<p>This undersells it, though.
It's more than a little bit of extra work to get started!
I know because I made a list of things to do to get started.</p>
<p>Rust needs something that <em>does</em> bundle this up for you, so that we can serve all web developers.
Having it would make it a lot easier to make the case to use Rust.
The benefits are there: you get wonderful type system, wonderful performance, and build times that give you back those coffee breaks you used to get while your code compiled.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-need">What do we need?</h2>
<p>There is a big pile of stuff that nearly every web app needs, no matter if it's big or small.
Here's a rough list of what seems pretty necessary to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Routing/handlers: this is pretty obvious, but we have to be able to get an incoming request to some handler for it. Additionally, this routing needs to handle path parameters, ideally with type information, and we'll give bonus points for query parameters, forms, etc.</li>
<li>Templates: we'll need to generate, you know, HTML (and sometimes other content, like JSON or, if you're in the bad times still, XML). Usually I want these to have basic logic, like conditionals, match/switch, and loops.</li>
<li>Static file serving: we'll need to serve some assets, like CSS files. This can be done separately, but having it as part of the same web server is extremely handy for both local development and for small-time deployments that won't handle much traffic.</li>
<li>Logins: You almost always need some way to log in, since apps are usually multi-user or deployed on a public network. This is just annoying to wire up every time! It should be customizable and something you can opt out of, but it should be trivial to have logins from the start.</li>
<li>Permissions: You also need this for systems that have multiple users, since people will have different data they're allowed to access or different roles in the system. Permissions can be complicated but you can make something relatively simple that follows the <code>check(user, object, action)</code> pattern and get really far with it.</li>
<li>Database interface: You're probably going to have to store data for your app, so you want a way to do that. Something that's ORM-like is often nice, but something light is fine. Whatever you do here isn't the <em>only</em> way to interact with the database, but it'll be used for things like logins, permissions, and admin tools, so it's going to be a fundamental piece.</li>
<li>Admin tooling: This is <em>arguably</em> a quality-of-life issue, not a necessity, except that every time you setup your application in a local environment or in production you're going to have to bootstrap it with at least one user or some data. And you'll have to do admin actions sometimes! So I think having this built-in for at least some of the common actions is a necessity for a seamless experience.</li>
<li>WebSockets: I use WebSockets in a lot of my projects. They just let you do really fun things with pushing data out to connected users in a more real-time fashion!</li>
<li>Hot reloading: This is a <em>huge</em> one for developer experience, because you want to have the ability to see changes really quickly. When code or a template change, you need to see that reflected as soon as humanly possible (or as soon as the Rust compiler allows).</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we have a pile of things that are quality-of-life improvements, and I think are necessary for long-term projects but might not be as necessary upfront, so users are less annoyed at implementing it themselves because the cost is spread out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Background tasks: There needs to be a story for these! You're going to have features that have to happen on a schedule, and having a consistent way to do that is a big benefit and makes development easier.</li>
<li>Monitoring/observability: Only the smallest, least-critical systems should skip this. It's really important to have and it will make your life so much easier when you have it in that moment that you desperately need it.</li>
<li>Caching: There are a lot of ways to do this, and all of them make things more complicated and <em>maybe</em> faster? So this is nice to have a story for, but users can also handle it themselves.</li>
<li>Emails and other notifications: It's neat to be able to have password resets and things built-in, and this is probably a necessity if you're going to have logins, so you can have password resets. But other than that feature, it feels like it won't get used <em>that</em> much and isn't a big deal to add in when you need it.</li>
<li>Deployment tooling: Some consistent way to deploy <em>somewhere</em> is really nice, even if it's just an autogenerated Dockerfile that you can use with a host of choice.</li>
<li>CSS/JS bundling: In the time it is, we use JS and CSS everywhere, so you probably want a web tool to be aware of them so they can be included seamlessly. But does it really have to be integrated in? Probably not...</li>
</ul>
<p>So those are the things I'd target in a framework if I were building one!
I might be doing that...</p>
<h2 id="the-existing-ecosystem">The existing ecosystem</h2>
<p>There's quite a bit out there already for building web things in Rust.
None of them quite hit what I want, which is intentional on their part: none of them <em>aspire</em> to be what I'm looking for here.
I love what exists, and I think we're sorely missing what I want here (I don't think I'm alone).</p>
<h2 id="web-frameworks">Web frameworks</h2>
<p>There are really two main groups of web frameworks/libraries right now: the minimalist ones, and the single-page app ones.</p>
<p>The minimalist ones are reminiscent of <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/">Flask</a>, Sinatra, and other small web frameworks.
These include the excellent <a href="https://actix.rs/">actix-web</a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/">axum</a>, as well as myriad <a href="https://www.arewewebyet.org/topics/frameworks/">others</a>.
There are so many of these, and they all bring a nice flavor to web development by leveraging Rust's type system!
But they don't give you much besides handlers; none of the extra functionality we want in a full for-lazy-developers framework.</p>
<p>Then there are the single-page app frameworks.
These fill a niche where you can build things with Rust on the backend and frontend, using WebAssembly for the frontend rendering.
These tend to be less mature, but good examples include <a href="https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.5/">Dioxus</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/leptos">Leptos</a>, and <a href="https://yew.rs/">Yew</a>.
I used Yew to build a <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/digital-vigil-for-tdor/">digital vigil</a> last year, and it was enjoyable but I'm not sure I'd want to do it in a "real" production setting.</p>
<p>Each of these is excellent for what it is—but what it is requires a lot of wiring up still.
Most of my projects would work well with the minimalist frameworks, but those require so much wiring up!
So it ends up being a chore to set that up each time that I want to do something.</p>
<h2 id="piles-of-libraries">Piles of libraries!</h2>
<p>The rest of the ecosystem is piles of libraries.
There are lots of template libraries!
There are some libraries for logins, and for permissions.
There are WebSocket libraries!</p>
<p>Often you'll find some projects and examples which integrate a couple of the things you're using, but you won't find something that integrates <em>all</em> the pieces you're using.
I've run into some of the examples being out of date, which is to be expected in a fast-moving ecosystem.</p>
<p>The pile of libraries leaves a lot of friction, though.
It makes getting started, the "just wiring it up" part, very difficult and often an exercise in researching how things work, to understand them in depth enough to <em>do</em> the integration.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-ve-done-before">What I've done before</h2>
<p>The way I've handled this before is basically to pick a base framework (typically actix-web or axum) and then search out all the pieces I want on top of it.
Then I'd wire them up, either all at the beginning or as I need them.</p>
<p>There are starter templates that could help me avoid some of this pain.
They can definitely help you skip some of the initial pain, but you still get all the maintenance burden.
You have to make sure your libraries stay up to date, even when there are breaking changes.
And you will drift from the template, so it's not really feasible to merge changes to it into your project.</p>
<p>For the projects I'm working on, this means that instead of keeping one framework up to date, I have to keep <code>n</code> bespoke frameworks up to date across all my projects!</p>
<p>Eep!</p>
<p>I'd much rather have a single web framework that handles it all, with clean upgrade instructions between versions.
There will be breaking changes sometimes, but this way they can be documented instead of coming about due to changes in the interactions between two components which don't even know they're going to be integrated together.</p>
<h2 id="imagining-the-future-i-want">Imagining the future I want</h2>
<p>In an ideal world, there would be a framework for Rust that gives me all the features I listed above.
And it would also come with excellent documentation, changelogs, thoughtful versioning and handling of breaking changes, and maybe even a great community.
All the things I love about Django, could we have those for a Rust web framework so that we can reap the benefits of Rust without having to go needlessly slowly?</p>
<p>This doesn't exist right now, and I'm not sure if anyone else is working on it.
All paths seem to lead me toward "whoops I guess I'm building a web framework."
I hope someone else builds one, too, so we can have multiple options.</p>
<p>To be honest, "web framework" sounds way too grandiose for what I'm doing, which is simply wiring things together in an opinionated way, using (mostly) existing building blocks<sup><a href="#a-few-of-my-own">1</a></sup>.
Instead of calling it a framework, I'm thinking of it as a <em>web toolkit</em>: a bundle of tools tastefully chosen and arranged to make the artisan highly effective.</p>
<p>My toolkit is called <strong>nicole's web toolkit</strong>, or <strong><code>newt</code></strong>.
It's available in a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~ntietz/newt">public repository</a>, but it's really not usable (the latest changes aren't even pushed yet).
It's not even usable for <em>me</em> yet—this isn't a launch post, more shipping my design doc (and hoping someone will do my work for me so I don't <em>have</em> to finish <code>newt</code> :D).</p>
<p>The goal for <code>newt</code> is to be able to create a new small web app and start on the actual project in minutes instead of days, bypassing the entire process of wiring things up.
I think the list of must-haves and quality-of-life features above will be a start, but by no means everything we need.
I'm not ready to accept contributions, but I hope to be there at some point.</p>
<p>I think that Rust really needs this, and the whole ecosystem will benefit from it.
A healthy ecosystem will have multiple such toolkits, and I hope to see others develop as well.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>If you want to follow along with mine, though, feel free to subscribe to my RSS feed or newsletter, or follow me on Mastodon.
I'll try to let people know in all those places when the toolkit is ready for people to try out.
Or I'll do a post-mortem on it, if it ends up that I don't get far with it!
Either way, this will be fun.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <h2 id="audience">Audience</h2>

<p>This post is for any enthusiastic SIMD CPU programmer curious about weird AVX instructions. But also for any veteran Amiga programmer who never quite figured out how to calculate that cursed “minterm” blitter value!</p>



<p>The idea for this post came while watching a great talk by Tom Forsyth [1] about the design of the AVX-512 ISA (Instruction Set Architecture). As I quickly skimmed through the slides, I paused at slide 41, where an obscure instruction caught my eye: <strong>vpternlogd</strong> (yeah, Intel engineers aren’t known for their naming skills!).</p>

<p>This instruction is a bitwise ternary logic operation, meaning it can perform any bitwise Boolean logic using three input sources. For example, if we label the inputs A, B, and C, you can create any complex logic operations like:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>NOT</span> <span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>OR</span> <span>((</span><span>NOT</span> <span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>XOR</span> <span>(</span><span>C</span> <span>AND</span> <span>A</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Or any other boolean logic combination you need—all in a single instruction!</p>

<p>What’s even cooler is that the inputs can be 512-bit registers, allowing this complex logic to be performed on 512 bits at once.</p>

<p>The author explained that adding specific instructions for every possible user needs (like “foo_and_a_or_not_b”) would have been overwhelming. It would require tons of new mnemonics, documentation, and testing. Instead, they opted for a smarter (and lazier?) solution: a single, flexible instruction:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>VPTERNLOGD</span> <span>r0</span><span>,</span> <span>r1</span><span>,</span> <span>r3</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>imm8</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The instruction takes 3 registers as input, and an 8-bit immediate value that defines the exact bitwise operations to do. Unfortunately, most documentation just says, “The immediate value determines the specific binary function,” which isn’t very helpful.</p>

<p>As soon as I saw this 8-bit immediate value, it reminded me of an old friend from 1985: the Amiga blitter chipset!</p>

<h2 id="amiga-blitter-custom-chip">Amiga blitter custom chip</h2>

<p>In the 1980s, it was common for computers to have custom chips for handling graphics. However, these chips didn’t handle complex tasks like triangle rasterization or programmable shaders. At that time, “graphics” primarily meant working with bitmaps. For example, the Commodore Amiga 500 had a blitter chip. Its main function was to move bitmap graphics from one location to another while applying logical operations. The Amiga’s blitter could handle up to three bitmap sources at once and perform logical operations between them. To specify which operation to use, you needed to set an 8-bit value in the chip, known as the “minterm.”</p>

<p>Three bitmap sources and an 8-bit value to control logical combinations! <strong>Doesn’t that sound like a primitive version of the modern AVX vpternlogd instruction?</strong></p>

<p>Interestingly, even many skilled Amiga programmers didn’t know how to calculate the minterm value. Most just reused common values from other demos. For instance, to clear a buffer, they would use 0x00. To configure the blitter to draw masked sprites, they’d use 0xE2. But for any other weird custom function, most of us were lost back in time.</p>

<p>The Amiga blitter user manual didn’t help much either. The “Amiga Hardware Reference Manual” from 1989 tried to explain minterm calculation using confusing symbols, which frustrated many young demo makers at the time.</p>

<p>Here’s what my teenage self would have done with a red marker if I had the official documentation in hand :)</p>

<p><img src="https://arnaud-carre.github.io/assets/img/minterm/crap.jpg" alt="crap"></p>

<h2 id="easy-way-to-calculate-minterm-value">Easy way to calculate minterm value</h2>

<p>Now, let me show you an easy way to calculate the minterm value. Even if you’re not planning to program the Amiga blitter anytime soon, you might find this useful for working with modern AVX ternary logic instructions—they work exactly the same way!</p>

<p>A few years ago, I realized that this 8-bit value doesn’t have to be understood as just a set of logical operators. Instead, it’s fundamentally <strong>just a lookup table</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s take an example: suppose you want the result to be 1 when exactly two of the three sources are 1.</p>

<p>First, list the 8 possible values of three input bits (A, B, and C), and add a fourth empty column for the result.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>A</th>
      <th>B</th>
      <th>C</th>
      <th>what I want</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>?</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>And now just fill the fourth column with the exact result you want your function to do. For our specific example, we want 1 when exactly <strong>two</strong> sources are 1. Let’s fill the fourth column:</p>

<p><img src="https://arnaud-carre.github.io/assets/img/minterm/table.jpg" alt="truth"></p>

<p>And now the magic: <strong>read the 8 bits of the fourth column, from bottom to up</strong>: 01101000, or 0x68. Function 0x68 will set 1 as a result if exactly 2 inputs are 1.</p>

<p><strong>And you also got the mysterious #imm8 value of the modern vpternlogd instruction!</strong></p>

<p>You can use the exact same method to get the #imm8 value for any exotic or complex logical function between 3 sources you need.</p>

<p>I wish my younger self had known this method back when I was scratching my head over blitter minterms!</p>

<h2 id="a-funny-coincidence">A funny coincidence</h2>

<p>One of the very common Amiga minterm values is 0xE2. This value is often used to render masked 2d sprites. With A containing the sprite bitmap, B containing the sprite “mask”, and C being the background.</p>

<p>An easy way to calculate the minterm for a masked sprite is to think of it in simple programming terms: <strong>when the mask pixel (B) is set, the result is sprite (A). If the mask pixel is not set, the result is background (C)</strong></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>A</th>
      <th>B</th>
      <th>C</th>
      <th>what I want</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0 (B is not set, use C)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1 (B is not set, use C)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0 (B is set, use A)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0 (B is set, use A)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0 (B not set, use C)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1 (B not set, use C)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1 (B is set, use A)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1 (B is set, use A)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Read the 8 bits bottom to up: 11100010, or 0xE2</p>

<p>So 0xE2 is a very common minterm value in Amiga demoscene culture. <strong>And now the funny part of this post:</strong></p>

<p>The official Intel documentation [2] about vpternlogd has an example of a #imm8 value. And over the <strong>256 possible user functions</strong> they could have chosen, I’ll let you discover what they chose :)</p>

<p>Is there any Amiga fanboy in the Intel documentation example team? A bit of retro influence never hurts! :)</p>

<article>
   
  <div><p>I’ve spent the past several years working with functional programming languages
in my free time – primarily Haskell and OCaml. I love both languages but also
find aspects of each frustrating.</p>
<p>Haskell is terse and elegant with type classes providing a powerful mechanism
for ad-hoc polymorphism. However, it can also be confusingly implicit and I
personally find lazy evaluation to have more downsides than upsides.</p>
<p>OCaml is explicit and powerful with a best-in-class module system. However, I
believe it is often exhaustingly explicit, especially when dealing with custom
data types in generic containers.</p>
<p>Over the past few months I’ve been experimenting with the
<a href="https://gleam.run/">Gleam</a> programming language and I’ve been very impressed. I
believe it makes three very interesting design choices that provide the best of
Haskell and OCaml, with relatively few downsides.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>use</code> expressions, which are syntactic sugar for
callback-style APIs</li>
<li>Structural equality for all types, including user-defined types</li>
<li>No ad-hoc polymorphism</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll explore the implications of these design decisions in this post, comparing
Gleam with Haskell and OCaml. I’ll be using only the standard libraries of each
language.</p>
<h2 id="brief-gleam-overview">Brief Gleam Overview</h2>
<p>Gleam is a strongly-typed functional programming language. It targets both the
BEAM (Erlang’s virtual machine) and JavaScript. It is impure (allowing untracked
side effects) and all data structures provided by the standard library are
immutable.</p>
<p>Here’s an example Gleam program that adds up the numbers in a list and prints
the result:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>import gleam<span>/</span>int
</span></span><span><span>import gleam<span>/</span>io
</span></span><span><span>import gleam<span>/</span>list
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>fn</span> <span>add</span>(sum: <span>Int</span>, n: <span>Int</span>) -&gt; <span>Int</span> {
</span></span><span><span>  sum <span>+</span> n
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>let</span> items <span>=</span> [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>]
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>  items
</span></span><span><span>  <span>|&gt;</span> list.fold(<span>0</span>, add)
</span></span><span><span>  <span>|&gt;</span> int.to_string
</span></span><span><span>  <span>|&gt;</span> io.println
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>// 15
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This simple program demonstrates some important parts of Gleam’s design:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optional type annotations (encouraged on top-level functions) with type
inference</li>
<li>First-class functions</li>
<li>Explicit imports</li>
<li>Visibility modifiers for functions (<code>pub</code> for public, default is private)</li>
<li>List literal syntax</li>
<li>The <code>|&gt;</code> operator for function pipelines (<code>a |&gt; f(b)</code> is equivalent to <code>f(a, b)</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s a slightly more complicated program:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>import gleam<span>/</span>int
</span></span><span><span>import gleam<span>/</span>io
</span></span><span><span>import gleam<span>/</span>list

</span></span><span><span>  Brown
</span></span><span><span>  White
</span></span><span><span>  Other
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>pub</span> <span>type</span> <span>Pet</span> {

</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>fn</span> <span>color_to_string</span>(color: <span>Color</span>) -&gt; String {

</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>// Hobbes is brown, Garfield is 5
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, we see even more cool features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom types, with multiple constructors</li>
<li>Exhaustive pattern matching</li>
<li>Polymorphic functions (<code>list.map</code> works with any type)</li>
<li>A string concatenation operator (<code>&lt;&gt;</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s enough Gleam to get into the rest of the post.</p>
<h2 id="monadic-style-apis">Monadic-style APIs</h2>
<p>I won’t fall into the trap of trying to define Monads in this post. Instead,
let’s talk about monadic-style APIs – that is, APIs that allow you to do a
bunch of things one after another, with the ability to use the result of a
previous computation in the next computation, and also allows some logic to
happen between steps.</p>
<p>A subset of these of APIs are often called <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/">“railway oriented
programming”</a> – you do a bunch of
steps, each which may fail, and if they all succeed you do something with the
results. We’ll focus on this use case for the rest of this section.</p>
<p>Let’s built a program that fetches several values from a key/value data
structure and, if all the values are present, adds them up. The second value we
fetch will depend on the first value we fetch.</p>
<p>Here’s an example in Haskell:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="haskell"><span><span><span>module</span> Main (<span>main</span>) <span>where</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>import</span> Data.Map (<span>Map</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>import</span> Data.Map qualified as <span>Map</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>doStuff</span> <span>::</span> <span>Map</span> <span>String</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span>

</span></span><span><span>  <span>let</span> result <span>=</span> doStuff items
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>  putStrLn (show result)
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>-- Just 3</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>Map.lookup</code> function has the following type:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="haskell"><span><span><span>ghci</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>t <span>Map</span><span>.</span>lookup
</span></span><span><span><span>Map</span><span>.</span>lookup <span>::</span> <span>Ord</span> k <span>=&gt;</span> k <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Map</span> k a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That is, given an key that is ordered and a map, it possibly returns a value.
The <code>Maybe</code> type represents a value that may or may not be present in Haskell.</p>
<p>There’s a few important things to notice about this program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Haskell’s <code>Map</code> type “just works” with <code>String</code> keys because <code>String</code> is
ordered.</li>
<li>Haskell’s <code>Maybe</code> type “just works” with the do-notation. If a function
returns <code>Nothing</code>, the do-notation short-circuits and the whole function
returns <code>Nothing</code>. However, it’s not obvious to the programmer <em>how</em> this
works or <em>what function specifically</em> is being called.</li>
<li>The <code>return</code> function “just works” to return a <code>Just</code> value. Again, this is
non-obvious to the programmer.</li>
<li>The <code>show</code> function automatically knows how to turn a <code>Maybe Int</code> into a
<code>String</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s a roughly equivalent example in OCaml:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ocaml"><span><span><span>module</span> <span>StringMap</span> <span>=</span> Map.<span>Make</span> <span>(</span><span>String</span><span>)</span>

</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>(* Some(3) *)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>StringMap.find_opt</code> function has the following type:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ocaml"><span><span><span>val</span> find_opt <span>:</span> key <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span>a t <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span>a option
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Some important things to notice here:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must explicitly create a <code>Map</code> with your chosen key type (in this case
<code>String</code>).</li>
<li>You must explicit create a module that represents the <code>let*</code> and <code>return</code>
functions for the <code>Option</code> type.</li>
<li>This <code>Syntax</code> module must be locally in-scope to use the appropriate
implementation of <code>let*</code> in the body of <code>do_stuff</code>. This means an explicit
local <code>open</code> of the <code>Syntax</code> module.</li>
<li>It’s very obvious to the programmer what implementation of <code>let*</code> and <code>return</code>
are being used in a given context.</li>
<li>You need to manually tell OCaml how to print a <code>int option</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let’s look at two examples of the same program in Gleam. Here’s the first
one:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>import gleam<span>/</span>dict.{<span>type</span> <span>Dict</span>}
</span></span><span><span>import gleam<span>/</span>int
</span></span><span><span>import gleam<span>/</span>io
</span></span><span><span>import gleam<span>/</span>result
</span></span><span><span>import gleam<span>/</span>string
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>fn</span> <span>do_stuff</span>(items: <span>Dict</span>(String, Int)) -&gt; Result(Int, Nil) {
</span></span><span><span>  items
</span></span><span><span>  <span>|&gt;</span> dict.get(<span>"a"</span>)
</span></span><span><span>  <span>|&gt;</span> result.<span>try</span>(<span>fn</span>(a) {
</span></span><span><span>    items
</span></span><span><span>    <span>|&gt;</span> dict.get(int.to_string(a))
</span></span><span><span>    <span>|&gt;</span> result.<span>try</span>(<span>fn</span>(b) { Ok(a <span>+</span> b) })
</span></span><span><span>  })
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>let</span> items <span>=</span> dict.from_list([#(<span>"a"</span>, <span>1</span>), #(<span>"1"</span>, <span>2</span>)])
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>  items
</span></span><span><span>  <span>|&gt;</span> do_stuff
</span></span><span><span>  <span>|&gt;</span> string.inspect
</span></span><span><span>  <span>|&gt;</span> io.println
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span><span>// Ok(3)
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>There are two important types in the above program. First, <code>dict.get</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>get</span>(from: <span>Dict</span>(a, b), get: <span>a</span>) -&gt; Result(b, Nil)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And second, <code>result.try</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>try</span>(
</span></span><span><span>  result: Result(a, b),
</span></span><span><span>  fun: <span>fn</span>(a) -&gt; Result(c, b),
</span></span><span><span>) -&gt; Result(c, b)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Dict</code> “just works” with <code>String</code> keys.</li>
<li>All function calls are explicit, along with their namespaces.</li>
<li>The nesting of <code>result.try</code> calls is a bit of a pain.</li>
<li><code>string.inspect</code> can automatically turn a <code>Result(Int, Nil)</code> into a <code>String</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This example has a bunch of the good features from Haskell and OCaml – generic
collections “just work”, it’s obvious what functions are being called, and
string conversion is convenient via <code>string.inspect</code>.</p>
<p>However, the “callback hell” pyramid of doom is not great. This is where <code>use</code>
comes to the rescue!</p>
<p>In Gleam, <code>use</code> is a mechanism for rewriting callback-based APIs in a flat
style. The following two blocks of code are equivalent:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>// standard callback
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>f(a, <span>fn</span>(b) { g(b) })
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>// with use
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>use</span> b <span>&lt;-</span> f(a)
</span></span><span><span>g(b)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We can employ <code>use</code> to remove the nesting from our previous example:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>import gleam<span>/</span>dict.{<span>type</span> <span>Dict</span>}
</span></span><span><span>import gleam<span>/</span>int
</span></span><span><span>import gleam<span>/</span>io
</span></span><span><span>import gleam<span>/</span>result
</span></span><span><span>import gleam<span>/</span>string
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>fn</span> <span>do_stuff</span>(items: <span>Dict</span>(String, Int)) -&gt; Result(Int, Nil) {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>use</span> a <span>&lt;-</span> result.<span>try</span>(dict.get(items, <span>"a"</span>))
</span></span><span><span>  <span>use</span> b <span>&lt;-</span> result.<span>try</span>(dict.get(items, int.to_string(a)))
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>  Ok(a <span>+</span> b)
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>let</span> items <span>=</span> dict.from_list([#(<span>"a"</span>, <span>1</span>), #(<span>"1"</span>, <span>2</span>)])
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>  items
</span></span><span><span>  <span>|&gt;</span> do_stuff
</span></span><span><span>  <span>|&gt;</span> string.inspect
</span></span><span><span>  <span>|&gt;</span> io.println
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span><span>// Ok(3)
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This example retains all of the previous advantages <em>and</em> removes the nested
callbacks. Very nice.</p>
<h2 id="custom-types">Custom Types</h2>
<p>Let’s say we want to rewrite our above examples, but this time our keys will be
a custom type rather than <code>String</code>s. Haskell first:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="haskell"><span><span><span>module</span> Main (<span>main</span>) <span>where</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>import</span> Data.Map (<span>Map</span>)

</span></span><span><span><span>data</span> <span>Person</span> <span>=</span> <span>Person</span>
</span></span><span><span>  { name <span>::</span> <span>String</span>,

</span></span><span><span>  }
</span></span><span><span>  <span>deriving</span> (<span>Eq</span>, <span>Ord</span>)
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>drew</span> <span>::</span> <span>Person</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>drew</span> <span>=</span> <span>Person</span> {name <span>=</span> <span>"Drew"</span>, age <span>=</span> <span>42</span>}
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>jane</span> <span>::</span> <span>Person</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>jane</span> <span>=</span> <span>Person</span> {name <span>=</span> <span>"Jane"</span>, age <span>=</span> <span>61</span>}

</span></span><span><span>  a <span>&lt;-</span> <span>Map</span><span>.</span>lookup drew items
</span></span><span><span>  b <span>&lt;-</span> <span>Map</span><span>.</span>lookup jane items
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>  return (a <span>+</span> b)

</span></span><span><span>  <span>let</span> result <span>=</span> doStuff items
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>  putStrLn (show result)
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>-- Just 3</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This works pretty much the same as our previous example, except we need to tell
Haskell that our <code>Person</code> can be compared for equality and is ordered (<code>deriving (Eq, Ord)</code>).</p>
<p>Next, here’s OCaml:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ocaml"><span><span><span>module</span> <span>Person</span> <span>=</span> <span>struct</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>type</span> t <span>=</span>

</span></span><span><span><span>;;</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>(* Some(3) *)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This has quite a bit more boilerplate than our previous OCaml example. When we
want a custom type to be the key of a <code>Map</code>, we must manually implement the
<code>compare</code> function (as noted earlier, I’m sticking to standard libraries, so no
<code>ppx_deriving</code>).</p>
<p>Finally, here’s Gleam:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>import gleam<span>/</span>dict.{<span>type</span> <span>Dict</span>}
</span></span><span><span>import gleam<span>/</span>io

</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>type</span> <span>Person</span> {
</span></span><span><span>  Person(name: String, age: <span>Int</span>)
</span></span><span><span>}

</span></span><span><span>

</span></span><span><span>  <span>use</span> a <span>&lt;-</span> result.<span>try</span>(dict.get(items, drew))
</span></span><span><span>  <span>use</span> b <span>&lt;-</span> result.<span>try</span>(dict.get(items, jane))
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>  Ok(a <span>+</span> b)
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>let</span> items <span>=</span> dict.from_list([#(drew, <span>1</span>), #(jane, <span>2</span>)])
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>  items

</span></span><span><span>  <span>|&gt;</span> string.inspect
</span></span><span><span>  <span>|&gt;</span> io.println
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span><span>// Ok(3)
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note that I don’t need to do <em>anything</em> to allow my custom <code>Person</code> type to be a
key in a <code>Dict</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Gleam has made some very interesting decisions in the functional programming
design space. I believe it has pragmatically taken the best of Haskell and
OCaml with very few downsides.</p>
<p>I’m surprised at how versatile <code>use</code> can be, especially given Gleam’s lack of
ad-hoc polymorphism or a module system. Folks have already made lovely <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/party/">parser
combinators</a>, <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/toy/">decoders</a>,
and more. I even wrote a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/clip/">CLI option parsing library</a>
myself.</p>
<p>I’m excited to continue working with Gleam and believe it has a bright future
for functional programming newcomers and old timers alike.</p>

<p>If you know noth­ing else about medieval Euro­pean illu­mi­nat­ed man­u­scripts, you sure­ly know the Book of Kells. “One of Ireland’s great­est cul­tur­al trea­sures” com­ments&nbsp;<a href="http://www.medievalists.net/2019/03/free-online-course-on-the-book-of-kells-returns/">Medievalists.net</a>, “it is set apart from oth­er man­u­scripts of the same peri­od by the qual­i­ty of its art­work and the sheer num­ber of illus­tra­tions that run through­out the 680 pages of the book.” The work not only attracts schol­ars, but almost a mil­lion vis­i­tors to Dublin every year. “You sim­ply can’t trav­el to the cap­i­tal of Ire­land,” writes <a href="https://bookriot.com/2015/11/05/10-things-know-book-kells/">Book Riot’s Eri­ka Har­litz-Kern</a>, “with­out the Book of Kells being men­tioned. And right­ful­ly so.”</p>
<p>The ancient mas­ter­piece is a stun­ning exam­ple of Hiber­no-Sax­on style, thought to have been com­posed on the Scot­tish island of Iona in 806, then trans­ferred to the monastery of Kells in Coun­ty Meath after a Viking raid (a sto­ry told in the mar­velous ani­mat­ed film <em><a href="https://www.awn.com/animationworld/secret-kells-what-remarkable-animated-feature">The Secret of Kells</a></em>). Con­sist­ing main­ly of copies of the four gospels, as well as index­es called “canon tables,” the man­u­script is believed to have been made pri­mar­i­ly for dis­play, not read­ing aloud, which is why “the images are elab­o­rate and detailed while the text is care­less­ly copied with entire words miss­ing or long pas­sages being repeat­ed.”</p>


<p>Its exquis­ite illu­mi­na­tions mark it as a cer­e­mo­ni­al object, and its “intri­ca­cies,” argue Trin­i­ty Col­lege Dublin pro­fes­sors Rachel Moss and Fáinche Ryan, “lead the mind along path­ways of the imag­i­na­tion…. You haven’t been to Ire­land unless you’ve seen the Book of Kells.” This may be so, but thank­ful­ly, in our dig­i­tal age, you need not go to Dublin to see this fab­u­lous his­tor­i­cal arti­fact, or a dig­i­ti­za­tion of it at least, <a href="https://digitalcollections.tcd.ie/concern/works/hm50tr726?locale=en">entire­ly view­able at the online col­lec­tions of the Trin­i­ty Col­lege Library</a>. <strong>(When you click on the pre­vi­ous <a href="https://digitalcollections.tcd.ie/concern/works/hm50tr726?locale=en">link</a>, make sure you scroll down the page.)</strong> The pages, orig­i­nal­ly cap­tured in 1990, “have recent­ly been res­canned,” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170705232205/https://www.tcd.ie/library/news/book-of-kells-now-free-to-view-online/">Trin­i­ty Col­lege Library writes</a>, using state-of-the-art imag­ing tech­nol­o­gy. These new dig­i­tal images offer the most accu­rate high-res­o­lu­tion images to date, pro­vid­ing an expe­ri­ence sec­ond only to view­ing the book in per­son.”</p>

<p>What makes the Book of Kells so spe­cial, repro­duced “in such var­ied places as Irish nation­al coinage and tat­toos?” asks Pro­fes­sors Moss and Ryan. “There is no one answer to these ques­tions.” In their <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2019/03/discover-the-great-medieval-manuscript-the-book-of-kells-in-a-free-online-course.html">free online course on the man­u­script</a>, these two schol­ars of art his­to­ry and the­ol­o­gy, respec­tive­ly, do not attempt to “pro­vide defin­i­tive answers to the many ques­tions that sur­round it.” Instead, they illu­mi­nate its his­to­ry and many mean­ings to dif­fer­ent com­mu­ni­ties of peo­ple, includ­ing, of course, the peo­ple of Ire­land. “For Irish peo­ple,” they explain in the course trail­er above, “it rep­re­sents a sense of pride, a tan­gi­ble link to a pos­i­tive time in Ireland’s past, reflect­ed through its unique art.”</p>

<p>But while the Book of Kells is still a mod­ern “sym­bol of Irish­ness,” it was made with mate­ri­als and tech­niques that fell out of use sev­er­al hun­dred years ago, and that were once spread far and wide across Europe, the Mid­dle East, and North Africa. In the video above, Trin­i­ty Col­lege Library con­ser­va­tor John Gillis shows us how the man­u­script was made using meth­ods that date back to the “devel­op­ment of the codex, or the book form.” This includes the use of parch­ment, in this case calf skin, a mate­r­i­al that remem­bers the anatom­i­cal fea­tures of the ani­mals from which it came, with mark­ings where tails, spines, and legs used to be.</p>
<p>The Book of Kells has weath­ered the cen­turies fair­ly well, thanks to care­ful preser­va­tion, but it’s also had per­haps five rebind­ings in its life­time. “In its orig­i­nal form,” notes Har­litz-Kern, the man­u­script “was both thick­er and larg­er. Thir­ty folios of the orig­i­nal man­u­script have been lost through the cen­turies and the edges of the exist­ing man­u­script were severe­ly trimmed dur­ing a rebind­ing in the nine­teenth cen­tu­ry.” It remains, nonethe­less, one of the most impres­sive arti­facts to come from the age of the illu­mi­nat­ed man­u­script, “described by some,” says Moss and Ryan, “as the most famous man­u­script in the world.” Find out why by <a href="https://digitalcollections.tcd.ie/concern/works/hm50tr726?locale=en">see­ing it (vir­tu­al­ly) for your­self</a> and learn­ing about it from the experts above.</p>

            <pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2024 15:18:20 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ben.page/jumbocode-ai">https://ben.page/jumbocode-ai</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41757711">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pagefind-body=""> <p>Some thoughts on AI and LLMs, based on being Head of Engineering for <a href="https://ben.page/jumbocode">JumboCode</a>, a club of 180 students at Tufts University that builds software for non-profits.</p>
<p>For context, almost all of our developers are learning web development (TypeScript, React, etc) from scratch, and have little prior experience with programming.</p>
<h2 id="use-of-llms-in-jumbocode-is-ubiquitous">Use of LLMs in JumboCode is ubiquitous</h2>
<p>LLMs excel at writing code for web development — you can describe a frontend component that you want and get a decent React component back.</p>
<p>I didn’t spend the year hawk-eyeing the teams’ repositories, but when I did poke my head in, I found substantial portions that <em>looked</em> LLM-written — that is to say, overly-commented, dissonant, and, at times, horrifying.</p>
<h3 id="horrifying"><em>“horrifying?”</em></h3>
<p>The starkest example I came across was a Next.js project that had:</p>
<ul>
<li>A page written in HTML and vanilla JavaScript, loaded from the <code>public/</code> directory, completely outside of the Next.js + React system.</li>
<li>Vanilla JavaScript loaded in via filesystem APIs and executed via <code>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</code>.</li>
<li>API calls from one server-side API endpoint to another public API endpoint on <code>localhost:3000</code> (instead of just importing a function and calling it directly).</li>
</ul>
<p>These don’t seem to me like classic beginner mistakes — these are <em>fundamental misunderstandings</em> of the tools and the web platform.</p>
<p>LLMs will obediently provide the solutions you ask for. If you’re missing fundamental understanding, you won’t be able to spot when your questions have gone off the rails.</p>
<h2 id="use-of-llms-hinders-learning-of-web-development">Use of LLMs hinders learning of web development.</h2>
<p>LLMs are a shortcut to get assignments done. In the process, however, you learn close to nothing.</p>
<p>It’s cliche, but struggling <em>is</em> learning. The way you learn is that you try different paths, piece bits of information together, and eventually create a mental model.</p>
<p>LLMs don’t require you to form a mental model and allow you to skip to the end result, but in turn you won’t <em>have</em> a mental model when you actually need one (for example, when you need to verify that your LLM has architected the code in a reasonable way).</p>
<p>LLMs are useful if you already have a good mental model and understanding of a subject. However, I believe that they are destructive when learning something from 0 to 1.</p>
<h2 id="you-should-probably-just-ask-a-person">You should probably just ask a person.</h2>
<p>You’ll learn a lot more by asking a real human, like your tech lead or a member of JumboCode’s board.</p>
<p>They can explain something in the exact context that you need it. And, in my experience at least, humans are still better than LLMs at providing concise, proper-level explanations.</p>
<h2 id="youll-probably-still-use-llms-instead-of-asking-a-person">You’ll probably still use LLMs instead of asking a person.</h2>
<p>Asking people is hard work and requires asking questions (scary). Many folks will still ask LLMs to write large swaths of code.</p>
<p>This is likely worse for your learning, but I can’t stop you (and I might be wrong).</p>
<p>But in my opinion, if you don’t have the time to do JumboCode without deferring whole tasks to LLMs, you’re probably better off not doing JumboCode. (And no hard feelings! I just don’t think that going through the motions via LLM-generated deliverables is worth the time.)</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="appendix-ben-do-you-use-llms">Appendix: Ben, do <em>you</em> use LLMs?</h2>
<p>Yes, I do! For example, I write code in <a href="https://cursor.so/">Cursor</a>, the self-proclaimed “AI Code Editor.”</p>
<p>But I’m honestly glad that I learned the fundamentals of web development before LLMs became ubiquitous. I don’t know if I would have had the will and motivation to properly learn the foundations otherwise — but doing so has paid off immensely for me.</p>
<p>If I had used LLMs to produce work when I was first learning web development, I would not have learned web development.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

            <p><span>P</span>lanetary rings may be one of space’s many spectacles, but in our solar system, they’re a dime a dozen. While Saturn’s rings are the brightest and most extensive, Jupiter and Uranus and Neptune have them, too. What’s more, four icy minor planets—Chariklo, Chiron, Quaoar, and Haumea—that orbit among or beyond our gas giants, also host ring systems. Even so, it would be fanciful to imagine that Earth once had a ring system of its own, wouldn’t it? I mean, that just seems almost too cool to be true.</p><p>Or is it?</p>
      
    <p>Rings are likely the dwindling remains of shredded asteroids or comets, and&nbsp;when you think about the turbulence Earth experienced around half a billion years ago, the reality of a bygone ring system around Earth seems less farfetched. That’s the case researchers make in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X24004230?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new study</a> published in <em>Earth and Planetary Science Letters</em>.</p><blockquote>
<p>If Earth went through one ringed phase, there’s a good chance it went through several.</p>

          </div><p>About 466 million years ago (long before the dinosaurs), the rate of stuff falling on Earth that was large enough to leave craters spiked sharply. Researchers have identified 21 impact craters from this spike, with sizes between a few and 50 kilometers in diameter. And sedimentary rocks from this period show a huge increase—a factor of 100 to 1,000—in the concentration of elements associated with a specific group of meteorites, called L chondrites. This period, the mid-Ordovician, also included an extreme drop in global temperature, roughly 10 degrees Celsius, which coincided with increased seismic and tsunami activity. Also, a mass extinction eliminated 85 percent of marine species, after which the temperature rebounded. What could possibly explain this?</p><p>The authors of the new study, led by Andy Tomkins, a geoscientist at Monash University in Australia, claim that you can account for the craziness of the Ordovician period if Earth had a system of rings that it captured from an asteroid. And if it went through one ringed phase, there is a good chance that it went through several. And for good measure, the other rocky planets may have done the same.&nbsp;</p><p>“This opens up a new way of thinking about the history of the Earth,” Tomkins wrote in an email. He and his colleagues focused on the distribution of craters on Earth during the Ordovician’s impact spike. The craters are spread across Earth’s surface, but its tectonic plates—the movement of which pushes the continents around—have shifted considerably in the last 450-plus million years.</p><p>The researchers determined where the impacts actually took place by “rewinding the clock” of the continents’ movements using computer models of how the Earth’s surface has rearranged itself. This showed that all of the crater-forming collisions took place within a narrow band centered on the equator. They gathered the data on where craters are located today (across the globe, especially in areas that were not likely to have been covered in ice during the Ordovician, given that ice could prevent crater formation), while also taking into account the regions where such craters could not have been found (due to present-day ice coverage, such as in Antarctica), and where craters could not have been preserved because of processes such as burial and erosion. Putting all of these factors together, Tomkins and his colleagues calculated that it would be highly improbable—we’re talking about a 1 in 25 million chance—that the impacts were randomly distributed across the Earth’s surface.</p>

When a comet or asteroid passes very close to a planet, the difference in gravity across the object is strong enough to stretch it to its breaking point.</p><p>We have seen tidal disruption in action: In 1992, the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 passed so close to Jupiter that it was torn into a string of about 20 fragments. Most of these rained down onto Jupiter in 1994. In the case of Saturn’s rings, the shards of the disrupted object were captured into orbit. The orbits of captured fragments would have started off being extremely stretched-out, or eccentric, and aligned with the initial orbital trajectory of the icy parent body.&nbsp; In time, the ring fragments collided with each other and were ground down to smaller pieces, and the collection of objects settled to a circular system of rings aligned with the plane of Saturn’s equator, where we see them now.</p><figure><img width="800" height="242" alt="In Body Image" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/jGa51alo-Raymond_BREAKER.png?auto=compress&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=png&amp;h=310&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large" srcset="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/jGa51alo-Raymond_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1600 800w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/jGa51alo-Raymond_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1200 600w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/jGa51alo-Raymond_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=800 400w" loading="lazy"><figcaption><strong>ALL BROKEN UP:</strong> Hubble Space Telescope image of the fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 after it was tidally disrupted during its close passage to Jupiter. <em>Credit: NASA, ESA, and H.

          </div><p>The ring-producing asteroid must have been an L chondrite, a type of ordinary meteorite (“ordinary” because they are the most common type of meteorites in our collections). Tomkins and his colleagues suggest that the L chondrite parent body passed extremely close to Earth—within just a few thousand kilometers of the surface, scratching the edge of the atmosphere—and was tidally disrupted, just like the object that broke apart and formed Saturn’s rings. Its fragments settled to Earth’s equatorial plane, and dust from the ring slowly rained down on Earth, along with the occasional impact of a larger fragment, mostly near the equator. This explains the high concentrations of L chondrite meteorite-like dust in Ordovician sedimentary rocks, as well as the distribution of craters across the globe.</p><p>The sharp drop in temperature after the Ordovician impact spike—called the Hirnantian global icehouse—may also have been a consequence of the Earth’s rings. The rings’ shadow would have fallen on whichever hemisphere was in winter at that time, and would have had a net cooling effect, which the dust in the atmosphere may have amplified. This drastic cooling perhaps played a role in the late Ordovician mass extinction: The global temperature bounced back up after the end of the Ordovician impact spike, presumably due to the dissipation of the rings.</p><p>“It seems plausible that the planets have seen multiple cycles of ring formation and loss,” Tomkins wrote in an email. These cycles would be triggered by the rare, very close passage of a comet or asteroid. Some planets are more likely to have ring phases than others, based on the frequency of asteroid flybys and the planets’ properties. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune seem to have more frequent, or longer-lived, ring phases because they interact far more frequently with asteroids and comets than the rocky planets, and so have far more chances of disrupting one and capturing its fragments. Ring phases usually last for millions of years at a time, with considerable consequences for a planet’s geology, climate, and potentially life.</p><p>For Tomkins, the search is underway for other potential pieces of evidence that Earth has undergone previous ring phases. The Ordovician spike is the clearest sign so far. “The cratering record gets weaker the further back in time we look,” he wrote in an email. “What other evidence can we look for that Earth may have had this and other rings in the past?”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Wi-Fi Goes Long Range on New WiLo Standard"><p><em>This article is part of our exclusive </em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/journal-watch/" target="_self"><em>IEEE Journal Watch series</em></a><em> in partnership with IEEE Xplore.</em></p><p>Researchers have developed a hybrid technology that would combine Wi-Fi with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa" target="_blank">Long Range (LoRa) networking protocol</a>, yielding a new long-distance wireless concept called WiLo. The research team has designed their proposed WiLo tech to be used on existing Wi-Fi and LoRa hardware. </p><p>The advance may find applications in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/internet-of-things" target="_blank">Internet of Things</a> (IoT) technologies–such as networks of long-range sensors used in agriculture or smart cities. </p><p><a href="https://sciprofiles.com/profile/88723" target="_blank">Demin Gao</a>, a professor in the College of Information Science and Technology at <a href="https://eng.njfu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Nanjing Forestry University</a> in China, notes that Wi-Fi has limitations today in its range and its high power consumption. By contrast, LoRa is based on low power requirements that yield long-range communication capabilities and is often used for IoT applications. </p><p>In WiLo, the two communications protocols have been combined to maximize advantages of each one, without the need for additional tech to bridge the two systems. “This reduces costs, complexity, and potential points of failure, making IoT deployments more efficient and scalable,” Gao says.</p><p>The researchers—hailing from universities in Hong Kong, mainland China, South Korea, the United States, and the United Kingdom, as well as <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/intel">Intel</a> employees in Germany—conducted their WiLo experiments used an off-the-shelf <a href="https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-connect/sx1280" target="_blank">SX1280</a> LoRa transceiver produced by Semtech. And while the SX1280’s 2.4 GHz communications band is shared with Wi-Fi (and a host of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1604479" target="_blank">other standards and technologies</a>), Wi-Fi and LoRa signals are not compatible. </p><p>So the researchers developed an algorithm to manipulate the frequency of Wi-Fi’s data transmission signals to match the signals that the LoRa device uses to communicate with other devices. In technical terms, they manipulated Wi-Fi’s data multiplexing standard (called <a href="https://www.cablefree.net/wirelesstechnology/ofdm-introduction/" target="_blank">OFDM</a>) to emulate the longer-ranged chirp signals used in LoRa’s chirp-spreading standard (called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10503" target="_blank">CSS</a>). </p><p>“This enables the use of standard Wi-Fi devices to communicate over long distances using LoRa without additional hardware,” says Gao.<br></p><p>The team tested their new WiLo approach both indoors—in a lab and hallway—and outdoors, over distances up to 500 meters. The researchers reported WiLo achieved a 96 percent success rate. </p><p>Gao says one benefit of WiLo concerns its ability to run on existing, off-the-shelf hardware. As a result, it would not require substantial deployment costs or complexity. On the other hand, one of WiLo’s limitations is the additional power consumption required for Wi-Fi devices to simultaneously handle communication and signal emulation—a problem Gao and his colleagues aim to address in future work. <br></p><p>Moving forward, Gao says, “To commercialize WiLo, the next steps would involve further optimization of the system to improve energy efficiency, data rates, and robustness against interference. This may require additional <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/software-development">software development</a> and testing across various IoT environments.”</p><p>Ensuring that the system complies with industry standards and integrating security measures for cross-technology communication are also necessary steps, Gao adds. </p><p>The team published their <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10680638" target="_blank">research</a> last month in the journal <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=26" target="_blank"><em>IEEE Transactions on Communications</em></a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

    <section id="what-is-hpy"><h2>What is HPy?<a href="#what-is-hpy" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>HPy provides a new API for extending Python in C.  In other words, you use
<code>#include &lt;hpy.h&gt;</code> instead of <code>#include &lt;Python.h&gt;</code>.</p>
</section><section id="what-are-the-advantages-of-hpy"><h2>What are the advantages of HPy?<a href="#what-are-the-advantages-of-hpy" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Zero overhead</strong> on CPython: extensions written in HPy run at the same
speed as "normal" extensions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Much faster</strong> on alternative implementations such as <a href="https://pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/python">GraalPy</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Universal binaries</strong>: extensions built for the <a href="https://docs.hpyproject.org/en/latest/overview.html#target-abis">HPy Universal ABI</a> can be
loaded unmodified on CPython, PyPy, GraalPython, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A migration path</strong> for mixing legacy C-API calls with HPy API calls. Once
all the code is migrated, the extension can be compiled as a universal binary
that works on any CPython version, PyPy, or GraalPy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Debug mode</strong>: in <a href="https://docs.hpyproject.org/en/latest/debug-mode.html">debug mode</a>, you can easily identify common problems such
as memory leaks, invalid lifetime of objects, invalid usage of APIs. Have
you ever forgot a <code>Py_INCREF</code> or <code>Py_DECREF</code>? The HPy debug mode can be
activated at runtime to detect these mistakes for you on universal binaries.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nicer API</strong>: the standard Python/C API shows its age. HPy is designed to
overcome some of its limitations, be more consistent, produce better quality
extensions and to make it harder to introduce bugs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evolvability</strong>: As nicely summarized in
<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0620/">PEP 620</a> the standard Python/C API
exposes a lot of internal implementation details which makes it hard to
evolve the C API. HPy doesn't have this problem because all internal
implementation details are hidden.</p></li>
</ul></section><section id="current-status"><h2>Current status<a href="#current-status" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>HPy is under active development. <a href="https://hpyproject.org/blog/posts/2023/10/hpy-0.9.0-fourth-public-release/">0.9.0</a> is the latest alpha release but we
will soon leave the _alpha_ state and are working hard towards a stable release.</p>
<p>We feel that the HPy ABI is stable enough now that we can fulfill our backwards
and forwards binary compatibility promises with the upcoming release, and that
the API now covers enough use cases to migrate important packages (in
particular, checkout our <a href="https://github.com/hpyproject/numpy-hpy/tree/graal-team/hpy#readme">numpy</a> port). We also provide porting guides and
extensive documentation (in particular the <a href="https://docs.hpyproject.org/en/latest/api-reference/index.html">API reference</a>).</p>
<p>We are, of course, always open for design discussions and new reqiurements.</p>
<p>The Python/C API is huge. At the moment many popular functions are
available. Is something missing for the port of your favorite extension?
Please open an issue or even better a PR.</p>
<section id="hpy-compatible-extensions"><h3>HPy-compatible extensions<a href="#hpy-compatible-extensions" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The extensions that we are experimenting with include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/hpyproject/ultrajson-hpy">ultrajson-hpy</a>: this was the first real-world module to be ported to HPy. It is
a nice fit because it only exports functions (as opposed as custom types)
and requires only a small number of API functions.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/hpyproject/piconumpy">piconumpy</a>: as the name suggests, this is a minimal numpy-like module which
defines a custom type (similar to <code>ndarray</code> but with many fewer features of
course).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/hpyproject/numpy-hpy/tree/graal-team/hpy#readme">numpy</a>: one of our ambitious goals is to port numpy to HPy, and to use this
experience to better understand how to design the API. This port is close to
passing the test suite.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/hpyproject/matplotlib-hpy/">matplotlib</a>: Since Matplotlib also has a dependency to NumPy, the migration
to universal mode is not fully finished. HPy provides the legacy compatibility API
such that we can still call legacy C API functions from HPy and successfully
run the test suite.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/hpyproject/kiwi-hpy/">kiwi-solver</a>: A dependency of Matplotlib, it has been fully ported to
universal mode.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Benchmarks and more information about the Matplotlib and kiwi-solver ports can
be found in the <a href="https://medium.com/graalvm/porting-matplotlib-from-c-api-to-hpy-aa32faa1f0b5">GraalVM blog post</a>. The benchmarks show that the HPy ports
have little impact on CPython performance, while enabling close-to-cpython
performance with GraalVM Python for the kiwi-solver complete HPy port.</p>
</section></section><section id="where-we-need-help"><h2>Where we need help<a href="#where-we-need-help" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Documentation:</strong> Our resources are very limited and we therefore concentrate
on technical tasks. We already wrote a significant amount of documentation
(see <a href="https://hpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Documentation</a>) but it is not complete yet. If this non-coding work is
something you can do, let us know.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Publicity:</strong> HPy is already well received among core developers of some
important projects. For instance, we are actively talking to Python, NumPy,
and Cython core developers. However, we need to get more package developers to
be interested in and even use HPy. We appreciate any help for advertising HPy
and we are also happy to help preparing talks, demos, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tooling:</strong> This is also a topic we would need help. We are, for example,
thinking of migration helper tools that do all the boilerplate work that can
be automated when migrating a package from C API to HPy API.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Packaging:</strong> There are several open questions we need to discuss and answer.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How to package a universal extension and how to put it on PyPI?</p></li>
<li><p>How best to package HPy itself</p></li>
<li><p>How does HPy integrate with setuptools, mesonpy, or other build systems</p></li>
<li><p>Upstreaming completed forks of the packages listed below, or upstreaming
parts of the forks so the code does not suffer from bit-rot</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Website and logo design:</strong> You don't like this website and the HPy logo?
Well, we have expertise in virtual machines, compilers, low-level programming,
etc, but zero expertise in web development or graphic design. <a href="https://github.com/hpyproject/hpyproject.org/">PRs are welcome

<p dir="auto">Gokapi is a lightweight server to share files, which expire after a set amount of downloads or days. It is similar to the discontinued <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/send">Firefox Send</a>, with the difference that only the admin is allowed to upload files.</p>
<p dir="auto">This enables companies or individuals to share their files very easily and having them removed afterwards, therefore saving disk space and having control over who downloads the file from the server.</p>
<p dir="auto">Identical files will be deduplicated. An API is available to interact with Gokapi. AWS S3 and Backblaze B2 can be used instead of local storage. Customization is very easy with HTML/CSS knowledge. Encryption including end-to-end encryption is available.</p>
