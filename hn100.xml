<li>Tesla is having a rough time in Europe.</li>

<hr>
<p>Europe is experiencing some weird times. From <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-power-play-exasperate-eu-capitals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics</a> to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-economic-apocalypse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economy</a> and <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/744949/ev-sales-europe-november-2024/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22744949%22%2C%22section%22%3A%221%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22ev-sales-europe-november-2024%22%7D">car sales</a>, it’s far from rosy, and arguably the biggest player in the electric vehicle game is having a rough year.</p>
<p>Eleven months into 2024, <a href="https://insideevs.com/tesla/" data-inline-widget="internal-links">Tesla</a> recorded a double-digit decrease in registrations, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), which released <a href="https://www.acea.auto/pc-registrations/new-car-registrations-1-9-in-november-2024-year-to-date-battery-electric-sales-5-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official figures for November</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, Tesla is still one of the largest EV manufacturers in Europe and the United States, but its grip is weakening on the other side of the Atlantic. Last month, Tesla recorded a 40.9% decrease in registrations in the European Union compared to the same month last year. The number of registrations went from 31,810 in November 2023 to 18,786 last month, marking a decrease in market share from 3.6% to 2.2%.</p>

<p>Year-to-date, Tesla had 211,405 registrations in the EU, 15.2% fewer than last year’s 249,265 units.</p>
<p>It’s a similar story when the European Free Trade Association members and the United Kingdom are included in the mix. EFTA members include Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. On these markets, Tesla registrations went down 28.4% in November, from 36,563 units last year to 26,191 units this year, which made the American automaker’s market share go down from 3.4% to 2.5%.</p>
<p>Year-to-date, Tesla registrations in the EU, EFTA and UK went down 13.7% from 327,635 units in 2023 to 282,692 units this year, while the market share shrunk from 2.8% to 2.4%. In the EU alone, which has 27 member states, Tesla’s market share went down from 2.6% in the first 11 months of last year to 2.2% this year.</p>

<p>The automaker’s losses can be attributed to a number of factors, including the increasingly controversial attitude of its CEO, <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/category/elon-musk/" data-inline-widget="internal-links">Elon Musk</a>, and the decrease in government incentives. Some European states have reduced the amount of money offered toward the purchase of a new EV, while others have eliminated the incentives altogether.</p>
<p>That said, Tesla’s significant drop in European registrations has largely left the EV industry unaffected. Considering the sheer volume of electric cars sold by Tesla, EV registrations as a whole only went down by 1.4% in the EU, EFTA and UK from January to November and they actually went up 0.9% in November compared to last year. In the EU alone, EV registrations went down 5.4% year-to-date and 9.5% in November.</p>
<p>This can only mean one thing: other automakers have stepped up to try and fill the gap left by Tesla, and customers are following suit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As executive director of Free Press Unlimited, I would like to sincerely thank Proton for their extraordinary support, which comes at a time when journalists around the world face unprecedented dangers.</p>



<p>Journalists are our eyes and ears, bringing us reliable and independent information, shining a light on the darkest corners of the world and ensuring that no injustice goes unseen.</p>



<p>Proton’s contribution helps us protect journalists so they can continue their vital work: bringing reliable news for all of us.</p>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://nothing2hide.org/en/"><strong>Nothing2Hide</strong><span>(new window)</span></a></p>



<blockquote>
<p>On behalf of the Nothing2Hide team, our partners and allies, we would like to thank you. Your support and trust enables us to support the journalists and activists who keep us informed. They all work in different environments, they all need to protect their data, their communications and their sources, but they need to do it differently. Your support will enable us to spend the time needed to provide personalised support. Your contribution is much more than a simple donation; it is a statement of support for freedom of information.</p>
<cite>Grégoire Pouget, Director and co founder of Nothing2Hide</cite></blockquote>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/"><strong>Ada Lovelace Institute</strong><span>(new window)</span></a></p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Ada Lovelace Institute is delighted to be included in the Proton Foundation’s annual fundraiser. These funds will support our work as a small non-profit to study the impacts of AI and data-driven technologies in public sector services on different publics, and build evidence on what policy and regulatory solutions can protect people from harm.</p>
<cite>Andrew Strait, Associate Director (Emerging technology and industry practice)</cite></blockquote>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.lawforchange.uk/"><strong>Law for Change</strong><span>(new window)</span></a></p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re honored to be chosen as a beneficiary of the Proton Lifetime Account Fundraiser. At Law for Change, we back legal actions that contribute to lasting social change, giving a voice to underrepresented people and communities with limited access to justice. Since our launch in 2023, we’ve supported over 50 public interest cases, holding public bodies and institutions to account on employment rights, environmental protections, access to public services, and combating discrimination faced by marginalized groups. By resourcing these vital legal actions, we contribute to the public good and help build a more just society. It’s inspiring to be supported by a like-minded community that shares our vision of a more just and accountable world. The funds raised will directly support our work to challenge companies’ harmful practices, defend rights, and empower those who are too often excluded.</p>
<cite>Stephen Kinsella, Founder</cite></blockquote>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fsfe.org/"><strong>Free Software Foundation Europe</strong><span>(new window)</span></a></p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are very happy to be chosen for Proton Lifetime Fundraiser! The FSFE aims to empowers people to control technology with Free Software. Proton’s support will be key for us keeping up our work, including: Protecting the right to remove and install any software on our devices. Example of that is our legal intervention against Apple in front of the European Court of Justice. It will also help us to raising awareness about the EU’s cut in funding for Free Software and fixing this. Our work with the story tale “Ada &amp; Zangemann” to spark children’s interest in technology will be also benefited. Proton’s donation will enable us to work on all of that and other activities for software freedom.</p>
<cite>Matthias Kirschner, President of Free Software Foundation Europe</cite></blockquote>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://theodi.org/"><strong>Open Data Institute</strong><span>(new window)</span></a></p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Open Data Institute is incredibly grateful to Proton and everybody who participated in the fundraiser. As we head into 2025, it’s more important than ever to make a meaningful and enduring impact on the data ecosystem. We’re an independent, non-partisan, not-for-profit organization, and support from the Proton Lifetime Fundraiser not only helps us to maintain that status, but also supports our research, policy advocacy, and thought leadership in a world that is constantly changing with technological advances, and where data is ever more vital.</p>
<cite>Louise Burke, CEO of Open Data Institute</cite></blockquote>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://freedomhouse.org/"><strong>Freedom House</strong><span>(new window)</span></a></p>



<blockquote>
<p>Freedom House is honored to have been selected as a beneficiary of this year’s Proton Lifetime Account Fundraiser. Global internet freedom has declined for nearly a decade and a half as censorship, violent retaliation for online speech, and government surveillance have undercut human rights online. Your support will enable us to continue to defend and expand freedom – both online and beyond – as we work in partnership with the generous Proton community to help realize our vision of a world where all people are free.</p>
<cite>Adrian Shahbaz, Vice President (Research and Analysis)</cite></blockquote>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/"><strong>Open Street Maps</strong><span>(new window)</span></a></p>



<blockquote>
<p>OpenStreetMap is a free digital crowd-sourced map of the world that is seen by or supports most people who use the Internet. We provide geospatial data for any person, company, government or university, without cost, onerous conditions or tracking. We are highly democratic and transparent and we support Free Open Source Software. Our values and Proton’s values align very closely. Your contribution to the Proton fundraiser will support our community outreach to support volunteer mappers globally and to support our computer systems that process crowdsourced mapping. Some prominent users are the United Nations, International Committee of the Red Cross, Doctors without Borders. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) use our maps to do rapid mapping in disaster zones. Many others use our data for research, government, recreation, delivery, collections and social media. Supporting us through Proton supports a world with better, free information.</p>
<cite>Craig Allan, Chairperson of OSM Foundation</cite></blockquote>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ladybird.org/"><strong>Ladybird Browser Initiative</strong><span>(new window)</span></a></p>



<blockquote>
<p>At the Ladybird Browser Initiative, we’re building more than just a web browser—we’re creating a truly independent, standards-first alternative that puts user agency and web transparency at the forefront. Our singular focus is developing a from-scratch web engine, built entirely on open web standards without borrowing code from existing browsers. We will never engage in search deals or user monetization—our commitment is purely to creating an open, user-centric browsing experience. Together, we’re expanding the possibilities of what an independent, principled web browser can be. The support from Proton’s fundraiser will accelerate our development, helping us bring a browser to users who value genuine technological independence and a web experience free from commercial compromises.</p>
<cite>Andreas Kling, Founder and President </cite></blockquote>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://techoversight.org/who-we-are/"><strong>Tech Oversight Project</strong><span>(new window)</span></a></p>



<blockquote>
<p>At The Tech Oversight Project, we are committed to an internet that rewards competition and protects people’s privacy. We cannot let the digital economy become a series of walled gardens controlled by Big Tech monopolies, and we are proud to count Proton as an ally in that fight.</p>
<cite>Sacha Haworth, Executive Director of The Tech Oversight Project</cite></blockquote>



<p>New this year, we are also allocating $200,000 to set up a Proton Innovation Fund to be administered by the nonprofit <a href="https://proton.me/foundation">Proton Foundation</a>. The fund will award four $50,000 grants to people working on projects promoting online privacy, security, or freedom. There will be an open call for applications later this year, so stay tuned.</p>



<h3>Together, we can achieve more</h3>



<p>At Proton, we believe the fight for privacy and freedom is a shared mission. This fundraiser highlights the incredible strength of our global community and the impact we can create together. Every ticket purchased, every donation made, and every message shared contributes to a movement that’s bigger than all of us.</p>



<p>Thank you for helping us make 2024 a record-breaking year. Your support inspires us to continue building tools that empower people to take control of their digital lives.</p>



<p>Here’s to another year of progress together.</p>

<p>My work PC is an old potato, and Chrome makes its fans cry whenever I open a lot of tabs. I always thought it was just my aging computer’s fault, until I switched to Firefox and found out it was Chrome all along.</p>    <!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. --><!-- Not injecting Ads due to No-Ads mode. --><h2 id="everything-that-chrome-can-do-and-more">
                        Everything That Chrome Can Do and More
               </h2>
<p>For as long as I can remember, Chrome has been my go-to. All my passwords, bookmarks, and extensions are always available wherever I log into my Google account. I only use the browser on my PC, which is why I’ve never felt the need to upgrade it. At least until recently, when it started to struggle when I installed a couple of new Chrome extensions.</p>    
<p>I figured it’s finally time to <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/346541/how-to-upgrade-or-replace-your-pcs-ram/" target="_blank">add more RAM to this machine</a> or say farewell to it entirely. For the time being, I switched to Firefox. I made a new account for it and linked it to the sync chain on the PC and my phone. To my surprise, my old timer PC runs it just fine, even with a ton of tabs open. No more angry fan noises.</p>

<p>And even more surprisingly, Firefox does everything Chrome does. The sync works perfectly across devices. You get a huge selection of <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/719529/how-to-install-extensions-add-ons-in-mozilla-firefox/" target="_blank">browser add-ons</a>, and you can customize a lot of the interface. It even has many neat features that Chrome doesn’t.</p>    
<p>The one feature it doesn’t have is the ability to turn regular web pages into web apps that you can launch from the desktop or taskbar. That’s something I wish the devs would add, but except for this nitpick, I don’t think I’ll be switching back to Chrome. Let me try to convince you why you should try Firefox too.</p>    <h2 id="superior-tab-management">

               </h2>
<p>Other than the search tabs feature, managing tabs in Chrome hasn’t changed in almost two decades (I’m not counting “Tab Groups” because they’re messy and confusing). A lot of people keep countless tabs open and all Chrome gives you is a cramped-up bar filled with tiny buttons that hide the text. Good luck finding a tab without hovering over each one.</p>

<p>Firefox has similar tab bars and buttons, but it has something Chrome doesn’t: Firefox View. <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/841156/whats-new-in-firefox-106-available-now/" target="_blank">Firefox View</a> is a window where you can see all your open tabs in one place. It’s conveniently stashed in a corner and opens with a single click.</p>    



    



                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
    

<p>You can sort the open tabs by recent activity or just by tab order. You can also search for open tabs.</p>    
<p>You can cycle through recently closed tabs, the entire search history, and even the tabs you’ve got open on other devices—all easily accessible, searchable, and sortable. There’s also a recent browsing tab where all the open tabs, recent tabs, and tabs from other devices are pooled together.</p>    
<p>If you’re someone who keeps a lot of tabs open and wastes too much time rummaging through them, trust me, you’ll love Firefox View.</p>    <h2 id="built-in-pocket-so-you-never-lose-a-link">
                        Built-in Pocket So You Never Lose a Link
               </h2>
<p>You know when you don’t want to lose a link, but it’s also not important enough to bookmark? Firefox has a button for that. It’s called <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/260850/how-to-save-articles-for-reading-later-with-pocket/" target="_blank">Pocket</a> and it keeps all your links safe in a tidy little collection.</p>    
<p>Even more importantly, it does so with a single click. Just click the tiny Pocket icon next to the address bar once, and it’ll be added to your saved collection. The collection syncs directly with your Firefox profile, so you can access it anywhere.</p>    



    



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
    

<p>To view your saves, you can open the Pocket app and find all your saved URLs in a beautiful layout. You can organize, tag, and archive the collections too.</p>    <h2 id="keep-your-real-email-safe">
                        Keep Your Real Email Safe

<p>Firefox Relay is an in-built privacy feature for <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/stop-giving-companies-your-real-email/" target="_blank">protecting your real email addresses</a>. When you’re signing up for a website, instead of giving out your real email address, you can share any of the five randomly generated Relay emails that Firefox provides.</p>

<p>Any emails sent to these aliases will be forwarded to your real email address. That way, the real email addresses stay hidden, but you still get your mail sent to them. There is also a handy Firefox Relay extension that autofills these burners when you’re filling out forms with email addresses.</p>    
<p>Firefox makes it super convenient to take screenshots. You don’t need to install any clunky browser extensions. Just right click anywhere, and click “Take Screenshot.” You can choose a full-page view or select an area to capture. It also detects web page elements, so you can capture perfect rectangular or square screenshots.</p>    



    



                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
    

<p>I know Chrome has a screenshot tool hidden in the developer options, but it’s not user-friendly at all.</p>    <h2 id="handy-chatgpt-button-in-the-right-click-menu">

<p>If you use ChatGPT or other AI bots like it often, you’ll appreciate how Firefox handles them. In Firefox, you can quickly send ChatGPT a prompt with a single click.</p>

<p>Just right-click anywhere on any webpage (or select a chunk of text) and ask ChatGPT to “Summarize,” “Explain this,” or “Quiz me.” It’ll open an AI Chatbot panel on the side where you can ask follow-ups or tweak the original prompt. If you don't find it on your Firefox, open Settings and look for the "AI Chatbot" feature in your Firebox Labs settings.</p>    <h2 id="other-thoughtful-touches">

<p>I also found some neat little features that Chrome doesn't have natively.</p>    <h3 id="picture-in-picture-for-any-video">
            Picture-In-Picture for Any Video

<p>On Firefox, you can pop out any video into its own little window. That way, you can watch multiple videos side by side, or work on other tabs or apps while the video plays in the corner. You can use this Picture in Picture feature by clicking the tiny pop-out icon that shows up when you play a video. Very handy.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://db-engines.com/en/blog">Blog</a> &gt; Post</p><p>by <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/users/Tom+Russell">Tom Russell</a>, 13 January 2025</p><p><span>DB-Engines is today announcing that </span><span>PostgreSQL is our DBMS of the Year for the second year in a row, </span><span>winning for </span><span>the fifth time overall.</span></p><p>DB-Engines is today announcing that PostgreSQL is our DBMS of the Year for the second year in a row, winning for the fifth time overall after also being top-ranked in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2023. Second in the rankings was Snowflake, followed by Microsoft in third place. PostgreSQL has emerged as the most popular database management system over the past year, outpacing all other 423 monitored systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nearly 35 years ago, the database system known as Postgres made its debut. Since then, PostgreSQL has undergone significant transformations, driven by a continuous stream of enhancements that ensure it remains at the cutting edge of DBMS technology, while also offering a dependable and stable platform. PostgreSQL 17, launched in September 2024, introduced additional performance enhancements and expanded replication options, among other improvements. All of this continues to make PostgreSQL one of the most successful open-source projects ever.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Snowflake is the runner up and is a cloud-based data warehousing company that has gained significant traction in recent years. Its unique architecture allows for the separation of storage and compute, providing flexibility and scalability. Snowflake's support for multi-cloud environments and its data sharing capabilities have made it a popular choice for businesses looking to leverage cloud data warehousing. Snowflake's rise in the rankings reflects its growing influence and adoption in the industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft's Azure SQL Database and SQL Server continue to be strong contenders in the DBMS market. Azure SQL Database offers a fully managed relational database with AI-powered performance optimization and scalability. SQL Server, with its hybrid capabilities, allows for seamless integration between on-premises and cloud environments. Microsoft's commitment to innovation and its comprehensive suite of data services have solidified its position in the top ranks.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><big>Notes to editors</big></h2>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>We calculate the DBMS of the year by subtracting the January 2024 from the January 2025 scores. We use the difference between each DBMS’s score, rather than a percentage growth, which would favor systems with lower popularity at the beginning of the year. The DMBS of the year is an illustration of how much each system increased in popularity during the year. You can read more about our exact <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_definition">methodology </a>here, but in short we are ranking popularity of DBMS based on how much people are discussing and communicating about each system, including job offers, professional profile entries and citations on the web. job offers, professional profile entries and citations on the web.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The launch of congestion pricing led to some 43,000 fewer drivers on average entering Manhattan below 60th Street each weekday last week than would be typical for that time of January, according to data released by the MTA on Monday. The data comes just over a week after the tolls went live.</p><p>The decline in traffic only amounts to a 7.5% reduction compared to projections based on Januarys from the last few years, before congestion pricing was activated. Under the projections, an average of 583,000 drivers would enter the toll zone each day. But such a reduction, <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/in-first-days-of-congestion-pricing-new-yorkers-see-signs-of-reduced-gridlock" rel="noopener" target="_blank">many people in Manhattan have observed</a>, can be the difference between flowing traffic and gridlock.</p><p>“It has been a very good week here in New York,” MTA deputy chief Juliette Michaelson said at a news conference. She cautioned that congestion pricing had only been in effect for eight days and that traffic patterns could change.</p><p>Traffic times on all inbound crossings — like the Williamsburg Bridge and the Holland Tunnel — have decreased between 30% to 40% on average, particularly during the morning commute, according to the MTA’s data.</p><p>Bus speeds also increased after the tolls were turned on. The Manhattan-bound B39 bus, which crosses the Williamsburg Bridge, ran 28% faster compared to a similar January week last year. Other buses like the SIM24 and and the M50 saw increases in speeds, as well.</p><p>As for ridership on the MTA’s buses, Michaelson said that some express buses including the BM1, QM16, BM4 and SIM9 saw higher than average ridership growth last week, but did not specify by how much.</p><p>The same data shows that speeds traveling north and south on avenues in the toll zone south of 60th Street didn’t change significantly.</p><p>The MTA turned on the toll cameras on Jan. 5, charging most drivers a daytime $9 fee to enter the zone.</p><p>The MTA is using the revenue from the congestion pricing tolls to issue a $15 billion bond to buy new train cars, install accessible elevators at subway stations across the city and other transit infrastructure improvements.</p><p>Michaelson said the MTA has not looked at the total revenue generated from the tolls in the first week of the program. The MTA estimates it can collect $500 million through congestion pricing every year.</p><p>Congressional Republicans from New York have <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/we-will-get-it-done-ny-republicans-say-trump-agreed-to-help-kill-congestion-pricing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vowed to kill the tolls</a> and said they have President-elect Donald Trump’s support.</p><p>But transit advocates said the first week of data showed congestion pricing is working.</p><p>"Drivers are saving tons of time. Buses are finally speeding up, especially express buses full of long distance commuters from across New York and New Jersey,” Riders Alliance spokesperson Danny Pearlstein wrote in a statement. "With such immediate success, politicians trying to end the program for personal gain must tell us why they want to lengthen millions of commutes, block tens of thousands of infrastructure jobs, and cut home values throughout the city and suburbs."</p><p><i>Stephen Nessen contributed reporting.</i></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Campsite</h2><a id="user-content-campsite" aria-label="Permalink: Campsite" href="#campsite"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is an open source version of the <a href="https://www.campsite.com/" rel="nofollow">Campsite</a> app. This codebase is available <strong>as-is</strong> and is not actively maintained by the Campsite team. We will only consider pull requests and issues regarding self-hosting or critical fixes. The codebase is provided as a reference for those interested in learning how Campsite works. We welcome forks of this repository for use in non-commercial projects.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Local dev setup</h2><a id="user-content-local-dev-setup" aria-label="Permalink: Local dev setup" href="#local-dev-setup"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To get started, run this command from the workspace root:</p>

<p dir="auto">Campsite requires setting up several services before you can run the basic version locally.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">S3 (critical)</h3><a id="user-content-s3-critical" aria-label="Permalink: S3 (critical)" href="#s3-critical"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">S3 is needed to upload avatars and attachments. We recommend separate buckets for dev and production. For example, we use <code>campsite-media</code> and <code>campsite-media-dev</code> buckets.</p>
<p dir="auto">You should setup a IAM user with <a href="https://github.com/campsite/campsite/blob/main/aws-policies.md">these suggested policies</a> (make sure to use your buckets in the policy).</p>
<p dir="auto">Set your credentials for the API:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cd api
script/credentials development"><pre><span>cd</span> api
script/credentials development</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Configure these under the <code>aws</code> key.</p>
<p dir="auto">We also recommend uploading the contents of the <code>default_avatars</code> directory under <code>static/avatars</code> in each S3 bucket. <a href="https://github.com/campsite/campsite/blob/main/default_avatars/readme.md">Read more here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pusher (critical)</h3><a id="user-content-pusher-critical" aria-label="Permalink: Pusher (critical)" href="#pusher-critical"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://pusher.com/" rel="nofollow">Pusher</a> is used to send realtime updates and events. After creating your account, configure this under the <code>pusher</code> key in your credentials.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Imgix (critical)</h3><a id="user-content-imgix-critical" aria-label="Permalink: Imgix (critical)" href="#imgix-critical"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.imgix.com/" rel="nofollow">Imgix</a> is the CDN powering Campsite. On AWS IAM, you will need to create an imgix user + policy (<a href="https://github.com/campsite/campsite/blob/main/aws-policies.md">see recommended policy</a>).</p>
<p dir="auto">Then, add S3 as an <a href="https://docs.imgix.com/en-US/getting-started/setup/creating-sources/amazon-s3" rel="nofollow">Imgix source</a>. If you setup dev and prod S3 buckets, you will need a separate Imgix source for each.</p>
<p dir="auto">Lastly, create an API Key for Imgix in your account dropdown.</p>
<p dir="auto">Fill in all of these values in the credentials files:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>imgix.url</code> - The S3 sourced image domain. Should look like <a href="https://campsite-dev.imgix.net/" rel="nofollow">https://campsite-dev.imgix.net</a></li>
<li><code>imgix.source_id</code> - The Imgix source ID (top of the source page or in the URL)</li>
<li><code>imgix.api_key</code> - The API key you created</li>
<li><code>imgix_video.url</code> - Same URL as <code>imgix.url</code> but with <code>.video</code> as the TLD (e.g. <a href="https://campsite-dev.imgix.video/" rel="nofollow">https://campsite-dev.imgix.video</a>)</li>
</ul>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">While here you can also setup <a href="https://docs.imgix.com/en-US/getting-started/setup/creating-sources/web-folder" rel="nofollow">Imgix Web Folders</a> and put the URL in <code>imgix_folder.url</code>. This is used to cache doc thumbnails, but isn't necessary on local dev. The web folder is needed to host doc thumbnails in prod.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">100ms</h3><a id="user-content-100ms" aria-label="Permalink: 100ms" href="#100ms"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.100ms.live/" rel="nofollow">100ms</a> powers Campsite's video conferencing features. After creating an account, set these values under the <code>hms</code> credentials key.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">Video calls with webhooks will only work when using a secure tunnel such as ngrok.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">OpenAI</h3><a id="user-content-openai" aria-label="Permalink: OpenAI" href="#openai"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We use the OpenAI API to generate summaries for calls and posts. You need both an API key and your organization ID (not the name, found in OpenAI platform settings). Add these under the <code>openai</code> credentials key.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Others</h3><a id="user-content-others" aria-label="Permalink: Others" href="#others"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are many other services we use to power Campsite features. Create accounts and set up credentials as needed:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>aws_ecs</code> - run data exports on AWS Elastic Container Service</li>
<li><code>cal_dot_com</code> - the Campsite <a href="https://cal.com/" rel="nofollow">Cal.com</a> app</li>
<li><code>figma</code> - render frames via the <a href="https://www.figma.com/developers/api" rel="nofollow">Figma REST API</a></li>
<li><code>linear</code> - the Campsite Linear app (see <a href="https://developers.linear.app/docs" rel="nofollow">API docs</a>)</li>
<li><code>omniauth_google</code> - Google OAuth</li>
<li><code>plain</code> - customer feedback (likely not needed)</li>
<li><code>postmark</code> - sending emails via the <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/developer" rel="nofollow">Postmark API</a></li>
<li><code>sentry</code> - bug reports, just need the DSN</li>
<li><code>slack</code> - Campsite Slack app</li>
<li><code>vercel.revalidate_static_cache</code> - generate your own key to safely revalidate cached docs (ISR)</li>
<li><code>webpush_vapid</code> - VAPID keys necessary to send web push notifications (<a href="https://github.com/pushpad/web-push#generating-vapid-keys">docs</a>)</li>
<li><code>zapier</code> - The Campsite Zapier app</li>
<li><code>tenor</code> - GIF search (<a href="https://tenor.com/gifapi" rel="nofollow">docs</a>)</li>

<p>TL;DR – Introducing <code>voyage-code-3</code>, our next-generation embedding model optimized for code retrieval. It outperforms OpenAI-v3-large and CodeSage-large by an average of 13.80% and 16.81% on a suite of 32 code retrieval datasets, respectively. By supporting smaller dimensions with Matryoshka learning and quantized formats like int8 and binary, <code>voyage-code-3</code> can also dramatically reduce storage and search costs with minimal impact on retrieval quality.</p>



<p>Since its launch in Jan, <code>voyage-code-2</code> has been the most heavily used model with exponentially increasing adoption by code assistants and agents startups for their code retrieval. Today, we’re thrilled to announce <code>voyage-code-3</code>, which:</p>



<ul>
<li>outperforms OpenAI-v3-large and CodeSage-large by an average of 13.80% and 16.81% on a suite of 32 code retrieval datasets, respectively</li>



<li>supports embeddings of 2048, 1024, 512, and 256 dimensions</li>



<li>offers multiple embedding quantization, including <code>float</code> (32-bit floating point), <code>int8</code> (8-bit signed integer), <code>uint8</code> (8-bit unsigned integer), <code>binary</code> (bit-packed <code>int8</code>), and <code>ubinary</code> (bit-packed <code>uint8</code>)</li>



<li>supports a 32K-token context length, compared to OpenAI (8K) and CodeSage large (1K)</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="Matryoshka-Embeddings-and-Quantization">Matryoshka Embeddings and Quantization</h2>



<p>Storage and search costs in vector-based search can become significant for large corpora, such as in code retrieval with massive repositories. The costs scale linearly in the embedding dimensionality and precision (i.e., the number of bits used to encode each number). <code>voyage-code-3</code> supports much lower dimensional embeddings and binary and int8 quantization to dramatically lower the costs without losing much retrieval quality. These are enabled by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13147" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Matryoshka learning</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00758" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">quantization-aware training</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Matryoshka embeddings.</strong> Matryoshka learning creates embeddings with a nested family of embeddings with various lengths within a single vector. Concretely, for each of k in {256, 512, and 1024}, the first k entries of the 2048-dimensional embedding also form a valid k-dimensional embedding that is shorter with a slight loss of retrieval quality. Thus, the users can vectorize the documents into a long 2048-dimensional vector in advance and then later have the flexibility to use a shorter version of the embedding (by taking the first k entries) without re-invoking the embedding model.</p>



<p><strong>Quantization.</strong> Quantized embeddings have lower precision, represented with 8 bits or 1 bit per dimension, reducing 4x or 32x storage costs compared to 32-bit floats, respectively. <code>voyage-code-3</code> can return the embeddings with lower precision with various data types, <code>int8</code> (8-bit signed integer), <code>uint8</code> (8-bit unsigned integer), <code>binary</code> (bit-packed <code>int8</code>), and <code>ubinary</code> (bit-packed <code>uint8</code>). Most vector databases support storing and searching with quantized embeddings directly, including Milvus, Qdrant, Weaviate, Elasticsearch, and Vespa AI.</p>



<p><strong>Storage cost vs retrieval quality tradeoff.</strong> Quantization and shorter embeddings inevitably come with a reduced retrieval quality. Voyage focuses intently on this, striving to minimize the quality loss as much as possible. The following graph plots retrieval quality versus relative storage cost — showing a limited reduction of quality up to binary 1024-dimensional embeddings compared to the float32 2048-dimensional embeddings.</p>

<p>All green data points above the green line represent <code>voyage-code-3</code>, and those below are uniquely colored per model and explicitly labeled with quantization and dimension. Lines connecting data points represent the same model and data type but at different embedding dimensions. The evaluation results used to generate this plot are available in&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q5GDXOXueHuBT9demPrL9bz3_LMgajcZs_-GPeawrYk/edit?gid=105010523#gid=105010523" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this spreadsheet</a>.</p>



<h2>Optimized for Code Retrieval</h2>



<p>Code retrieval presents unique challenges compared to general text retrieval due to the need for algorithmic reasoning and the nuanced syntax rules such as keywords, control structures, nesting, and formatting. These challenges are further complicated by several retrieval subtasks, including text-to-code (e.g., retrieve code snippets using natural language queries), code-to-code (e.g., identify semantically similar code snippets), and docstring-to-code (e.g., retrieve code snippets using function docstring queries).</p>



<p><strong>Curated, massive code training data.</strong> We curated a larger, more diverse, high-quality code corpus for training <code>voyage-code-3</code> than <code>voyage-code-2</code>. First, we assembled a broad corpus with trillions of tokens comprising text, code, and mathematical content with a carefully tuned code-to-text ratio. Next, we developed a comprehensive dataset with positive pairs for contrastive learning based on public GitHub repositories, containing docstring-code and code-code pairs across 300+ programming languages. This dataset was combined with the general text pair dataset used to train our leading general-purpose <code>voyage-3</code> model. Finally, we collected additional real-world query-code pairs, covering a wide range of tasks in code assistant use cases, to ensure robust coverage of real-world scenarios.</p>



<p><strong>Evaluation.</strong> We evaluated <code>voyage-code-3</code> using an enhanced suite of evaluation datasets designed to address the shortcomings of existing benchmarks and deliver practical, robust results. Existing datasets can suffer from noisy labels, overly simplistic tasks, and data contamination risks, making them ill-suited for real-world applications. For instance, the original CoSQA dataset was found to have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11589" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">51%</a> of its queries paired with mismatched code. Our evaluation incorporated diverse tasks, such as text-to-code and code-to-code, repurposed question-answer datasets for retrieval, and introduced complex, real-world repositories and scenarios that challenge embedding models to achieve deeper understanding.

<h2>Evaluation Details</h2>



<p><strong>Datasets.</strong> We evaluate <code>voyage-code-3</code> across 32 datasets spanning five categories that cover various code retrieval tasks, real-world use cases, and challenging code scenarios. These datasets are discussed in length in our code retrieval evaluation blog <a href="https://blog.voyageai.com/2024/12/04/code-retrieval-eval/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>. The table below summarizes the key datasets.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Spain has announced plans to impose a tax of up to 100% on real estate bought by non-residents from countries outside the EU, such as the UK, in an aim to tackle the country’s housing crisis.</p><p>The measure was one of a dozen unveiled on Monday by the country’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, as the government seeks to quell <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/30/a-family-used-to-live-here-the-spanish-sticker-rebellion-battling-tourist-lets" data-link-name="in body link">mounting anger</a> over housing costs that have soared far beyond the reach of many in Spain.</p><p>Sánchez sought to underline the global nature of the challenge, citing housing prices that had swelled 48% in the past decade across <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Europe</a>, far outpacing household incomes.</p><p>“The west faces a decisive challenge: to not become a society divided into two classes, the rich landlords and poor tenants,” he told an economic forum in Madrid.</p><p>The proposed measures include expanding the supply of social housing, offering incentives to those who renovate and rent out empty properties at affordable prices and cracking down on seasonal rentals. In Spain just 2.5% of housing is set aside for social housing, a figure that lags drastically behind countries such as France and the Netherlands, said Sánchez.</p><p>But it was the government’s plans to crackdown on foreign, non-EU buyers that grabbed headlines around the world. Spain has long been a popular destination for non-EU holiday home buyers, with residents of the UK, US and Morocco flocking to buy properties in places such as Ibiza, Marbella and Barcelona.</p><p>Sánchez described the tax of up to 100% as “unprecedented” in Spanish history. “Just to give an idea, in 2023 alone non-European Union residents bought around 27,000 houses and flats in Spain. And they didn’t do it to live in them, they didn’t do it for their families to have a place to live, they did it to speculate, to make money from them, which we – in the context of shortage that we are in – obviously cannot allow.”</p><p>He did not offer more details on how the plan would work or when it would be finalised and sent to parliament for approval. Given his government’s longstanding struggles to pass legislation, one analyst suggested to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8e2e9f04-1606-4d2d-8b9c-0094b1cef038" data-link-name="in body link">the Financial Times</a> that the government’s aim was to deter foreign property investors by creating “uncertainty and noise” with a proposal that has slim chances of becoming law.</p><p>The government’s slate of measures also took aim at tourist flats, which have long <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/barcelona-mayor-defends-ban-tourist-flats-drastic-action-needed-cut-housing-costs" data-link-name="in body link">been blamed</a> for shrinking the rental supply and leaving locals priced out of the market.</p><p>Sánchez said regulations on these rentals would be tightened while the taxes they pay would be hiked. “It is not fair that those who own three, four, five apartments for short-term rental pay less tax than hotels,” said Sánchez.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-10">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-10" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>He argued that the measures were necessary to tackle what he described as an “unbearable” mismatch between rising housing prices and household incomes.</p><p>“We are facing a serious problem, with enormous social and economic implications, which requires a decisive response from society as a whole, with public institutions at the forefront,” he added.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You can see in the screenshot that the data is then exfiltrated to a website that the attacker owns.</p>
<p>Now, typically, when we see packages like this, they are attempting to perform a dependency confusion attack on a specific company.&nbsp; I don’t know if Cursor.com has a bug bounty program or a specific background. Still, I would suspect that Cursor has several NPM private packages named “cursor-always-local”, “cursor-retrieval”, and “cursor-shadow-workspace”.&nbsp; The person who created these packages is probably hoping that Cursor employees accidentally install these public packages, which will send their data to the attacker-controlled web service.</p>
<p>Luckily, in addition to me seeing these files, the OpenSSF package analysis scanner identified these packages as malicious.&nbsp; OSV generated 3 malware advisories:&nbsp; MAL-2025-27, MAL-2025-28 and MAL-2025-29.&nbsp; You can see the malware advisories here:&nbsp; <a href="https://osv.dev/list?q=cursor&amp;ecosystem=npm">https://osv.dev/list?q=cursor&amp;ecosystem=npm</a></p>
<h2><strong>Who deployed these malicious packages?</strong></h2>
<p>Okay, we know what the packages do when installing them, and we think they target <a href="https://cursor.com/">Cursor.com</a>.&nbsp; Who would do this?&nbsp; Well, the answer is in the NPM package metadata.</p>
<p>The user who published the NPM package uses a snyk.io email address for the Snyk Security Labs team.&nbsp; This part of the metadata cannot be faked.&nbsp; The author field in the metadata specifically mentions an employee at Snyk.&nbsp; This part of the NPM package metadata can be faked, but since the publisher is a verified Snyk email, my guess is that this genuinely came from Snyk.</p>

<h2>1.7 million New York households lost FCC discount</h2>
<p>The order said quick implementation of the law is important because of "developments at the federal level impacting the affordability of broadband service." About 1.7 million New York households, and 23 million nationwide, used to receive a monthly discount through an FCC program that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/fcc-makes-last-plea-to-congress-as-broadband-discount-program-runs-out-of-cash/">expired in mid-2024</a> after Congress failed to provide more funding.</p>
<p>"For this reason, consumer benefit programs assisting low-income households—such as the ABA—are even more critical to ensure that the digital divide for low-income New Yorkers is being addressed," the New York order said.</p>
<p>New York ISPs can obtain an exemption from the low-cost broadband law if they "provide service to no more than 20,000 households and the Commission determines that compliance with such requirements would result in 'unreasonable or unsustainable financial impact on the broadband service provider,'" the order said.</p>
<p>Over 40 small ISPs filed for exemptions in 2021 before the law was blocked by a judge. Those ISPs and potentially others will be given one-month exemptions if they file paperwork by Wednesday stating that they meet the subscriber threshold. ISPs must submit detailed financial information by February 15 to obtain longer-term exemptions.</p>
<p>"All other ISPs (i.e., those with more than 20,000 subscribers) must comply with the ABA by January 15, 2025," the order said. Failure to comply can be punished with civil penalties of up to $1,000 per violation. The law applies to wireline, fixed wireless, and satellite providers.</p>
<p>Charter Spectrum currently <a href="https://www.spectrum.com/internet/spectrum-internet-assist">advertises</a> a $25-per-month plan with 50Mbps speeds for low-income households. <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/learn/internet-service/acp">Comcast</a> and <a href="https://www.optimumadvantageinternet.com/">Optimum</a> have $15 plans. Verizon has a <a href="https://www.verizon.com/discounts/verizon-forward/">low-income program</a> reducing the cost of some home Internet plans to as low as $20 a month.</p>

				<article>
					
					<h3>January 11, 2025</h3>
					<p><a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/11/01/using-wordpress-is-risky">Since I last wrote about WordPress</a>, things have gone off the rails. This after a brief period when things were blissfully quiet. Matt Mullenweg stopped commenting for a while, though his company had launched <a href="https://wordpressenginetracker.com/">WP Engine Tracker</a> — a site for tracking WordPress-driven websites that moved away from WP Engine. I think this is a bit gauche, but it seems like fair marketing given everything that’s going on. It should be noted that many sites are leaving for Pressable — owned by Mullenweg’s company, Automattic —&nbsp;because of <a href="https://pressable.com/wpe-contract-buyout/">a sweetheart deal</a>.</p>

<p>But the drama ramped up quickly after WP Engine <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24318350/automattic-restore-wp-engine-access-wordpress">won a preliminary injunction</a> against Automattic on December 10th. The injunction required that WP Engine be <a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/10/10/loyalty-test-checkbox">allowed to access WordPress.org resources</a>, and that Automattic <a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/10/13/acf-has-been-hijacked">stop interfering with WP Engine plugins</a>, while the trial moves forward. Ernie Smith <a href="https://tedium.co/2024/12/14/wordpress-wp-engine-reaction/">wrote an excellent piece</a> with more details on outcome of the injunction, including a note about Mullenweg quitting a community Slack instance with a <a href="https://tedium.co/2024/12/14/wordpress-wp-engine-reaction/#:~:text=Don%E2%80%99t%20print%20in%20the%20newsletter%20that%20I%E2%80%99m%20mad">hammy message</a>. Mullenweg complied with the injunction, though the “<a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/10/10/loyalty-test-checkbox">loyalty test checkbox</a>” text was changed to a still-required <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/17/pineapple-on-pizza-is-delicious-and-if-you-disagree-you-cant-log-in-to-wordpress-org/">note about pineapple on pizza</a>.</p>

<p>On December 20th, <a href="https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-declares-holiday-break-for-wordpress-org-services">Mullenweg announced</a> that WordPress.org would be on holiday break for an unspecified amount of time. <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/12/holiday-break/">In a post on the WordPress.org blog</a>, he again mentioned being “compelled to provide free labor and services to WP Engine thanks to the success of their expensive lawyers”. He also invited people to fund legal attacks against him by signing up for WP Engine services, and hoped to have the “time, energy, and money to reopen all of this sometime in the new year”.</p>

<p>This was the first time WordPress.org had ever gone on break, and it was another instance of Mullenweg using a core part of the WordPress community to send a message. WordPress.org <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-services-resume-after-holiday-break">returned to service on January 4th</a>, but plugin and theme updates weren’t being reviewed until then. I’m all for giving volunteers time off, but this came as a surprise to the community and there was initially no indication when the break would end. Mullenweg’s “woe is me” language around maybe, possibly, being able to find the resources to reopen a core piece of WordPress infrastructure didn’t help things. It <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262232/matt-mullenweg-wordpress-org-wp-engine">further cemented</a> that Matt Mullenweg’s current mood is an important function of whether or not the WordPress community operates smoothly.</p>

<p>While WordPress.org was on hiatus, Mullenweg also reached out to the WPDrama community on Reddit, asking <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WPDrama/comments/1hlp08d/what_drama_should_i_create_in_2025/">what drama he should create in 2025</a>. A couple of years ago, this sort of thing would have been some tongue-in-cheek fun from a person who’s always been a bit of a goof. These days it comes off a bit differently.</p>

<p>Then yesterday happened. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24340717/automattic-wordpress-contribution-hours-cut-wp-engine">Automattic announced</a> that it would restrict its contributions to the open source version of WordPress. The company would now only put in about 45 hours a week total — down from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24340717/automattic-wordpress-contribution-hours-cut-wp-engine">nearly 4,000 a week</a> — so as to match the estimated hourly contributions of WP Engine. This action is blamed on the “<a href="https://automattic.com/2025/01/09/aligning-automattics-sponsored-contributions-to-wordpress/#:~:text=the%20legal%20attacks%20started%20by%20WP%20Engine%20and%20funded%20by%20Silver%20Lake">the legal attacks started by WP Engine and funded by Silver Lake</a>”, which I think is a gross mischaracterization. <a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/09/26/wordpress-vs-wp-engine">WP Engine definitely did not start this</a>.</p>

<p>Automattic noted it would focus its open source hours on “security and critical updates”. The other hours would be redirected to <a href="https://automattic.com/2025/01/09/aligning-automattics-sponsored-contributions-to-wordpress/#:~:text=for%2Dprofit%20projects%20within%20Automattic%2C%20such%20as%20WordPress.com%2C%20Pressable%2C%20WPVIP%2C%20Jetpack%2C%20and%20WooCommerce">for-profit projects like WordPress.com</a>. This means that the community will be expected to take up the slack if it wants WordPress to improve. I also really doubt that 45 hours a week is enough time to keep WordPress secure and bug-free.</p>

<p>And you know what? In a normal world, that would be fine. I’d be all for it! If the community were to take control of the open source project, I think that would be ideal. The problem is that Mullenweg has final say over some very important parts of the WordPress community. He also seems recently to be acting more childishly and impulsively than usual.</p>

<p>Another thing that <a href="https://www.threads.net/@karaswisher/post/DEniSxyS01i">came to light yesterday</a> was that the WordPress Sustainability committee was shuttered after a core member, Thijs Buijs, stepped down. In a post on the WordPress Slack, Buijs cited the “2025 drama” post on Reddit as the reason he was leaving, and called for a change in WordPress community leadership. In response, Mullenweg responded in part with “[t]oday I learned that we have a sustainability team”, and closed the channel.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/sustainability/">WordPress Sustainability Team</a> had four core members, and <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/sustainability/graphs/contributors">11 people</a> who had contributed on GitHub. As far as I can tell, they were all community members, and none were Automattic employees. Even if it wasn’t producing amazing results, I can’t see what harm it was doing. The sin was pointing out something stupid that Mullenweg did, and having a member wanting change. The optics, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/los-angeles-wildfires-1.7429025">especially given current world events</a>, are definitely not great. The wildest part of this to me is that there’s video of Mullenweg — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Qq1SBFzByDw?si=S2RfSBj2ioLl3WPC&amp;t=28744">live on stage at Word Camp Europe in 2022</a> — requesting the creation of the Slack channel he was turning off. Guess that slipped his mind.</p>

<p>All of this bodes poorly for the open source version of WordPress. I think it’s perfectly fair for Automattic to switch gears and focus on for-profit projects — it’s a company after all. The problem is that there’s a void being left. Automattic had, for better or worse, lead the development of both the commercial and open source pieces of the WordPress ecosystem. Now it seems like the community needs to take over, but Mullenweg still holds all the keys.</p>

<p>In the announcement, <a href="https://automattic.com/2025/01/09/aligning-automattics-sponsored-contributions-to-wordpress/#:~:text=Part%20of%20this%20will%20be%20making%20WordPress.com%20much%20closer%20to%20a%20core%20WordPress%20experience%2C%20instead%20of%20having%20a%20different%20interface">Automattic said</a> that WordPress.com would be updated to be more in line with the open source version of WordPress. This also makes sense to me, as WordPress.com has always been a <a href="https://wordpress.com/support/com-vs-org/">weird version</a> of the software. Of course, having slight differences to the core WordPress experience is the argument that Mullenweg initially used to call WP Engine a “<a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine/">cancer</a>”, but who’s keeping track? I’d also like to point out again that Automattic <a href="https://automattic.com/ventures/#:~:text=by%20Silver%20Lake-,Series%20A,-Managed%20WordPress%20hosting">invested in WP Engine in 2011</a>. It also <a href="https://automattic.com/ventures/#:~:text=2012-,Acquired%20by%20Automattic,-Convertible%20Note">acquired Pressable in 2016</a>, likely because it was a hosting service that offered a “real” version of WordPress, unlike WordPress.com.</p>

<p>It’s hard to see how to move forward from here. I think the best bet would be for people to rally around a new community-driven infrastructure. This would likely require a fork of WordPress, though, and that’s going to be a messy. The current open source version of WordPress <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AWordPress%2FWordPress%20%22wordpress.org%22&amp;type=code">relies on the sites and services Mullenweg controls</a>. Joost de Valk, the original creator of an extremely popular <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/">SEO plugin</a>, wrote a <a href="https://joost.blog/wordpress-leadership/">blog post with some thoughts on the matter</a>. I’m hoping that more prominent people in the community step up like this, and that some way forward can be found.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you’re a WordPress developer, you may want to <a href="https://craftcms.com/blog/migrating-from-wordpress">look into some other options</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Moments after posting this, I was pointed to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/11/matt-mullenweg-deactivates-wordpress-accounts-of-contributors-planning-a-fork/">story on TechCrunch</a> about Mullenweg deactivating the WordPress.org accounts of users planning a “fork”. This after he <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/10/spoon/">previously promoted</a> (though in a slightly mocking way) the idea of forking open source software. In both cases, the people he mentioned weren’t actually planning forks, but musing about future ways forward for WordPress. Mullenweg framed the account deactivations as giving people the push they need to get started. Remember that WordPress.org accounts are required to submit themes, plugins, or core code to the WordPress project. These recent events really make it seem like you’re no longer welcome to contribute to WordPress if you question Matt Mullenweg.</p>
