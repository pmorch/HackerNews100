	<h3>August 2020</h3>
	<p>Piloting an <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-de/product/ocean-exploration-ship-60266">ocean exploration ship</a> or <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-de/product/mars-research-shuttle-60226">Martian research shuttle</a> is serious business. Let's hope the control panel is up to scratch. Two studs wide and angled at 45°, the ubiquitous "2x2 decorated slope" is a LEGO minifigure's interface to the world.</p>

<p>These iconic, low-resolution designs are the perfect tool to learn the basics of physical interface design. Armed with 52 different bricks, let's see what they can teach us about the design, layout and organisation of complex interfaces. </p>

<p>Welcome to the world of LEGO UX design.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/interfaces.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<h2>Organised chaos</h2>

<p>At a glance, the variety of these designs can be overwhelming, but it's clear that some of these interfaces look far more chaotic than others. Most interfaces in our world contain a blend of digital screens and analog inputs like switches and dials. These LEGO panels are no different.</p>

<p>Plotting the panels across these two axes reveals a few different clusters. Screens with an accompanying row of buttons sit in the top left. A small cluster of very organised switch panels lies to the far right. The centre bottom is occupied by some wild concepts that are hard to understand, even after several glances.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/positioning.jpg" alt="Design positioning with LEGO, in LEGO" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Design positioning with LEGO, in LEGO</figcaption></figure>

<p>Designing a complex machine interface is a juggling act of many different factors from ergonomics to engineering. But we can break down the problem into two key questions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>How can we <strong>differentiate</strong> between the function of different inputs?</li>
	<li>How can we <strong>organise</strong> the many inputs and outputs so that we understand how they relate to each other?</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's take a deeper look at tackling these two challenges in LEGO.</p>

<h2>Differentiating inputs</h2>

<p>What could cause 400 WWII pilots to raise the landing gear on their B-17 bomber just before touchdown? Catastrophic pilot error, or something more fundamental?</p>

<p>It was the psychologist Alphonse Chapanis who first suggested that the high rate of crash landings might be the fault of poor interface design. The adjacent landing gear and flap control knobs were identically shaped. The pilots never stood a chance.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/landing.jpg" alt="B-17 belly landing, and the shape coding that helped to eradicate the problem. Source: Wikipedia" loading="lazy"><figcaption>B-17 belly landing, and the shape coding that helped to eradicate the problem. Source: Wikipedia</figcaption></figure>

<p>His temporary solution was to glue differently shaped strips of rubber to each switch, enabling blind operation by touch alone. This gave rise to the idea of shape coding and a system of differentiation still being followed in aircraft cockpits today.</p>

<p>We can compare the three interfaces below to see this in action. Ignore the overall layout, it's the differences between individual switches that matter here. Imagine trying to feel for one of these buttons without looking. The left panel ("Slope 45 2 x 2 with 12 Buttons") would require careful hand-eye co-ordination. The right panel ("Aircraft Multiple Flight Controls") clearly distinguishes between the throttle (large, linear vertical movement), toggle switches (round vertical flick) and the push buttons (square push-in). </p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/differentiation.jpg" alt="Left to right: terrible, poor and better input differentiation" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Left to right: terrible, poor and better input differentiation</figcaption></figure>

<p>Differentiation like this is a still a very real problem today. In 2015, <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2015/01/06/autos/ford-push-button-ignition-recall/index.html">Ford recalled 13,500 Lincoln SUVs</a> because drivers speeding down the motorway were mistakenly shutting off the engine when they tried to activate sport mode. See if you can spot why:</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/ford-lincoln.jpg" alt="Ford Lincoln MKC before the Engine start/stop button was moved. Source: CNN" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Ford Lincoln MKC before the Engine start/stop button was moved. Source: CNN</figcaption></figure>

<p>Shape coding is one approach to differentiation, but there are many others. Colour coding is perhaps the only one to break into our everyday vocabulary, but we can add four more: size, texture, position and operation coding. Together these six are our allies in the design of error-proof interfaces.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/codings.jpg" alt="The 6 basic codings. Notice that many of these examples actually combine multiple codings in one." loading="lazy"><figcaption>The 6 basic codings. Notice that many of these examples actually combine multiple codings in one.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Size, shape and colour-coding are the fundamentals: quick-wins that can fix a lot of interface problems. Texture is also a great differentiator for blind operation, particularly on small dials requiring precise control.</p>

<p>Position-coding is seemingly straightforward but is often under used. Products with a clear default ergonomic position (like binoculars or a gaming console) can exploit the natural position of the hand to differentiate between primary and secondary actions.</p>

<p>Finally, operation-coding ascribes different types of movements (like a twist or vertical slide) to different inputs. This can be immensely powerful when the switch motion reinforces the operation behind it, e.g. a crane lever which raises the crane when the lever is raised.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/lego-codings.jpg" alt="The six different codings in use in the LEGO interfaces: size, shape, colour, texture, position, operation" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The six different codings in use in the LEGO interfaces: size, shape, colour, texture, position, operation</figcaption></figure>

<p>Differentiation is a good first step that will avoid confusion between adjacent switches. But its only with organisation that we can create a clear and accurate mental model of the interface for the user.</p>

<h2>Organising inputs</h2>

<p>Compare the three panels below. Identical layouts, but the blue one is much clearer than the white. This is the <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/blog/gestalt-principles">gestalt principles</a> at work, identifying related items with a common region.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/gestalt.jpg" alt="Basic differentiation by clustering" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Basic differentiation by clustering</figcaption></figure>

<p>Easy. But how are you going to decide which inputs to cluster together?</p>

<p>I like to use <a href="http://blog.presentandcorrect.com/27986-2">Soviet control panels</a> as a starting point. These beautiful walls of nonsensical dials and levers are brought to life when arranged in a giant factory schematic.  It would be hard to find a more literal organisation of the information.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/soviet-control-panels.jpg" alt="Soviet control panels in action. Source: Present and Correct" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Soviet control panels in action. Source: Present and Correct</figcaption></figure>

<p>These panels are what I'd called a consolidated interface. Every piece of input and feedback has been moved onto the same panel. This is the approach that <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/33847/the-defunct-dyson-evs-steering-wheel-looks-like-it-was-made-by-vacuum-cleaner-people">Dyson took with their car</a>. Now imagine the opposite, moving each of those lights and switches to the actual location of that valve in the factory. Sounds ludicrous, but these <a href="https://deeptread.com/blog/2016/11/21/audi-tt-air-vent-design">air vents in the Audi TT</a> show that this distributed approach can also be a great win for user experience. I wrote a lot more about these <a href="https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/2018/Interfaces/">distributed interfaces last year</a>.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/distributed.jpg" alt="Lego vehicle dashboard: distributed (left) vs. consolidated (right)" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Lego vehicle dashboard: distributed (left) vs. consolidated (right)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Back to the Soviet factories. Those interface panels were great for answering the question "does this valve let water into tank Б?". But they're very poor for answering "are all water valves closed?" or "where are all the switches I need to prepare for the shift changeover?".</p>

<p>LEGO use the Soviet schematic approach for their <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=3298pb005&amp;in=S">fantasy</a> <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=3298px10&amp;in=S">orientated</a> designs, because schematics are superb at providing a mental model of the inner workings of an alien system. However for everyday use, there are some other approaches that work better.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/alien-interfaces.jpg" alt="LEGO Insectoid and UFO interfaces. I wonder what these buttons actually do?" loading="lazy"><figcaption>LEGO Insectoid and UFO interfaces. I wonder what these buttons actually do?</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Feature</strong> based organisation is the most common, perhaps even the "default" design philosophy. Group together all the inputs and outputs for each product feature. This <a href="https://www.cambridgeconsultants.com/press-releases/building-life-saving-ventilator-lightning-speed">COVID-19 ventilator from Cambridge Consultants</a> is a wonderful example but we also see this a lot in cars, with a cluster of switches for the airflow control and all of the lights on one control stick.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/covid-ventilator.jpg" alt="COVID-19 ventilator by Cambridge Consultants with clear feature-based organisation. Source: Cambridge Consultants" loading="lazy"><figcaption>COVID-19 ventilator by Cambridge Consultants with clear feature-based organisation. Source: Cambridge Consultants</figcaption></figure>

<p>Organising by <strong>operation</strong> means putting all the switches that function in a certain way in the same place. I've no idea what all the valves in the picture below do, but I bet they don't all open things that relate to each other. Anytime you see a row of switches that look and function the same, but control disparate parts of the system, you've come across organisation by operation.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/valves.jpg" alt="Source: Twitter @aglushko" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Source: Twitter @aglushko</figcaption></figure>

<p>Today most interfaces are effectively <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly-by-wire">fly-by-wire</a>, but historically the levers that you pulled in, say, a tractor cabin would literally move the hydraulic pistons beneath the seat to a new position. Routing all these different electrical, mechanical and hydraulic systems efficiently can severely compromise your interface clustering, leading to organisation by <strong>technology</strong>.</p>

<p>The modern equivalent of this is surprisingly common. Any touchscreen with buttons by the side exhibits this technology-based split. In a <a href="https://www.chrisharrison.net/index.php/Research/PneumaticDisplays">future</a> <a href="https://vimeo.com/343640141">world</a>, SpaceX might embed <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-crew-dragon-touchscreen-astronaut-thoughts.html">these physical controls</a> right inside the screen next to the information they affect, but for now they sit awkwardly by the side as if nothing is wrong.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/spacex-dragon.jpg" alt="Bob and Doug in the SpaceX Dragon capsule. Source: SpaceX" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Bob and Doug in the SpaceX Dragon capsule. Source: SpaceX</figcaption></figure>

<p>In LEGO we find the feature based organisation in the "Monitor with -19° pattern". Two clear clusters, perhaps one for temperature control and another for vital signs monitoring. In the second panel below, I don't know what all those switches do, but they seem to be clustered based on their operation, not because of what they will operate.</p>

<p>There are many LEGO panels with a technology split like the SpaceX Dragon capsule, but I like to imagine that this early 90s police control unit was forced to divide the audio and video playback because the newer tape reel technology was incompatible with the older analog phone line system. This is organisation by technology in action.</p>

<figure><img src="https://interactionmagic.com/images/pages/UX-LEGO-Interfaces/organisation.jpg" alt="L-to-R: organisation by feature, operation, technology and use case" loading="lazy"><figcaption>L-to-R: organisation by feature, operation, technology and use case</figcaption></figure>

<p>All of our approaches so far: organisation by features, operation or technology, have been grounded in properties of the system, not of the user. Organisation by <strong>use-case</strong> is the antidote to this, a clustering based on the daily routines and tasks of the user.</p>

<p>Imagine arriving for work each day at the LEGO body scanner factory. Grouping the switches by task (prepare machine, load body, process scan...) would mean splitting up the radiation and scanner buttons into many different regions. More complex for the computer, but more streamlined for the operator. As the designer, only you and your users will be the judge of what works best.</p>

<h2>But George, which is the best interface?</h2>

<p>I often say there's no such thing as the best interface, but there are plenty of examples of the worst interface.</p>

<p>However I do have three favourites. Beautiful, visual layouts with clearly differentiated inputs and simple, clean organisation. I'd be proud to sit behind the console of any of them.</p>

Liberal Richard Colbeck abstained.</p><p>It followed an hour of spirited debate that saw crossbenchers question and heckle the major parties over what they said was a rushed and flawed law.</p><p>Liberal MP Bridget Archer also broke with her party earlier in the week to vote with the Greens and a handful of independents against the bill in the House of Representatives on Wednesday.</p><p>The major parties had moved quickly to pass the legislation before the end of the parliamentary year, despite reservations from some Coalition MPs, the Greens and independents who called for more time and greater scrutiny.</p><figure data-print="inline-media" data-component="Figure" id="104648542" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/104648542"><div><p><img alt="Anthony Albanese uses his phone on the floor of the House of Represenatives." sizes="100vw" src="https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/7a85d273cac7acd0a7d19cff024ff8a3?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=3333&amp;cropW=5000&amp;xPos=0&amp;yPos=319&amp;width=862&amp;height=575" loading="lazy" data-component="Image" data-lazy="true"></p></div><figcaption><p data-component="Typography">Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in parliament this week.&nbsp;<!-- --> <cite>(<span>ABC News: Luke Stephenson</span>)</cite></p></figcaption></figure><p>Tech companies also agitated for the debate to be delayed until the government's age-verification trial is finalised.</p><p>Under the laws, which won't come into force for another 12 months, social media companies could be fined up to $50 million for failing to take "reasonable steps" to keep under 16s off their platforms.</p><p>There are no penalties for young people or parents who flout the rules.</p><p>Social media companies also won't be able to force users to provide government identification, including the Digital ID, to assess their age.</p><p>"Messaging apps," "online gaming services" and "services with the primary purpose of supporting the health and education of end-users" will not fall under the ban, as well as sites like YouTube that do not require users to log in to access the platform.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">Mixed views from mental health experts</h2><p>The bill was introduced to parliament last Thursday and was referred for a Senate inquiry the same day. Submissions to the inquiry closed on Friday, a three-hour hearing was held on Monday, and the report was tabled on Tuesday.</p><p>Almost all the submissions raised concerns about the "extremely short" consultation period, the committee report noted.</p><p>"Legislation is a necessary tool, but it is not a panacea," Labor senator Karen Grogan wrote.</p><p>"Young people, and in particular diverse cohorts, must be at the centre of the conversation as an age restriction is implemented to ensure there are constructive pathways for connection."</p><p>During the public hearing, witnesses with experience working with young people on their mental health offered a mix of views on the ban.</p><p>Danielle Einstein, a clinical psychologist who has supported the campaign to raise the age at which kids can access social media, said social media offered no mental health benefits for young people as far as she could see.</p><p>But Nicole Palfrey from mental health organisation Headspace was more circumspect, telling the inquiry there was a need to balance any harms from social media with the benefits of connection and "help-seeking" online — especially for kids who live in remote or rural areas.</p><p>"When we hear from psychologists and parents they are very much confronted with [the] pointy end, they only see the harms and I think that's incredibly valid," Lucy Thomas from anti-bullying organisation Project Rockit said.</p><p>"But as people working with young people every day, we also see the benefits.</p><p>"We need to tread very carefully or we risk dialling back young peoples' rights and pushing them into more isolated, less supported places."</p></div></div>]]></description>

We want to make things more balanced.</p><p>I may know one of the culprits -- whom I will leave unnamed here.  But the company, who is fairly popular, built out their own CDN via putting a bunch of nginx caching proxies on various Hetzner servers around the world.  It apparently was really cheap and very effective.  Given that they were bootstrapped and this was prior to Cloudflare really being that popular, it was a great strategy.  This was true like 8 years ago, so maybe it has changed in the meantime.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>I think culprits is a poor choice of words since it means someone suspected of a misdeed. I could perhaps understand using it for example for someone that tried to store a petrabyte of storage on a consumer unlimited storage plan. But in this case Hetzner set a specific data usage amount you are paying for so using that amount is not a misdeed.</p>

                  <p>Sounds like a completely legitimate use though.  Hetzner were widely telling people about that 20TB limit, so why would they be surprised when people use them as CDN boxes?</p>

                  <p>I was curious and checked if they are still using Hetzner.  It appears not, so I can share who it was.  It was <a href="https://artstation.com/" rel="nofollow">https://artstation.com</a>.  Basically heavily oriented towards serving static images, so the CDN could have been really expensive.  Doing a reverse IP lookup on cdn.artstation.com servers now resolves to Cloudflare and it has cloudflare headers on the response.</p>

									<p><span itemprop="articleBody"><p>When the witty and wry English fantasy novelist Terry Pratchett interviewed Bill Gates for <em>GQ </em>in 1995, only 39% of Americans had access to a home computer. According to the Pew Research Center, the number who were connected to the internet was a paltry 14%. At the dawn of the internet age, when optimistic bromides about the information superhighway to the 21st century were replete in politics and culture, the author of the “Discworld” series was less sanguine.</p><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p>
<p>While talking to the CEO of Microsoft, Pratchett asked what would happen if a writer disseminated on the internet something atrocious and libelous, say a pseudo-academic work of Holocaust denial. “There’s a kind of parity of esteem of information on the net,” said Pratchett, “there’s no way of finding out whether this stuff has any bottom to it or whether someone has just made it up.” Predictably, Gates denied the threat of any sort of epistemological collapse. Without offering any mechanism for doing so, the billionaire told the author that “you will have authorities on the net… The whole way that you can check somebody’s reputation will be so much more sophisticated.” Google was three years into the future—Facebook would be founded in nine years—Twitter in eleven. If Pratchett seemed sardonic and cynical in 1995, then Gates’ pollyannish, Panglossian exuberance appears positively psychotic three decades later.</p>
<span>What’s been sacrificed is not reading in the most prosaic sense, but the particular experience of a certain type of reading.</span>
<p>Pratchett’s warning may have been lonely during that distant age of unbridled tech-enthusiasm, but he wasn’t the only Cassandra warning about reality through a smartphone screen darkly. Astrophysicist Carl Sagan predicted in his 1995 <em>The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark</em>&nbsp;that “when awesome technological powers are in the hands of the very few… [and] when the people have lost their ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority” the nation would “slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.”</p>
<p>For many readers in the previous century’s last decade, after the vanquishing of Soviet communism and the seemingly never-ending ascendancy of the American experiment, the arc of the moral universe had turned in part because of the supposedly liberatory power of technology. What Pratchett and Sagan prophesized, however, was a coming tumultuousness, not an end of history but rather the demise of truth. Less of a computer revolution than a computer apocalypse.</p>
<p>Before Pratchett or Sagan—before social media and the smart phone, bot farms and artificial intelligence—there was Sven Birkerts’s damning <em>The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of Reading in an Electronic Age. </em>Released thirty years ago on December 1, Birkerts challenged the coming digital transformation when it was still a gleam in the eye of men like Gates (and long before Zuckerberg or Musk). As a manifesto, <em>The Gutenberg Elegies </em>was in opposition to the prevailing utopianism of the ‘90s, seeing in the denigration of physical books an irreparable harm.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p></div>
<p>In the author’s estimation, the ceding of material books to the ephemeral gauze of the online posed a threat to our attention, to the ability of immersing ourselves within complex narrative or engaging in the almost-transcendent flow of reading. “Everything in contemporary society discourages interiority,” writes Birkerts. “More and more of our exchanges take place via circuits, and in their very nature those interactions are such as to keep us hovering in the virtual now, a place away from ourselves.” If true in 1994, how much more accurate today? As an antidote to the virtual obliteration of the self, Birkerts returns to literature, arguing that in the “slow and meditative possession of a book,” what he calls “deep reading,” we are able to “keep alive the dangerous and exhilarating idea that life is not sequence of lived moments, but a destiny.”</p>
<p>Many critics disparaged Birkerts as a fussy Luddite. The anonymous reviewer at Kirkus denounced Birkerts as an “inveterate bookworm,” a “curmudgeon” who offered a “simplistic and unconvincing jeremiad.” Wen Stephenson at the <em>Chicago Review </em>claimed that the medium is not the message, describing how he experienced no difference in parsing Seamus Heaney on the page as opposed to the screen, asking “does it matter that it is transmitted to me, voice and word, through a computer? …the question is beginning to bore me by now.” Dean Blobaum of the University of Chicago Press castigated how <em>The Gutenberg Elegies </em>makes electronic media the “whipping boy for the ills of western society,” claiming that Birkerts’ argument is too all-encompassing, blaming computers for the “Decline in education, literacy, and literate culture.” Here’s the thing some thirty years later, however—Birkerts was right.</p>
<p>Central to the negative reviews was a misunderstanding of just how different information hashed through the internet would be when compared with the physical codex, that venerable two-millennia old technology. The Kirkus reviewer, for example, imagines a straw-Birkets at various hinge moments in the past, who inveighs against the “ballpoint, the typewriter, the printing press.” What this critique misses are that those were technologies of production, but the internet is also a technology of reception. The frenetic, interconnected, hypertext-permeated universe of digital reading is categorically a different experience. Even more importantly, a physical book on a shelf is a cosmos unto-itself, while that dimension of interiority and introspection—of privacy—is obscured in the virtual domain.</p>
<p>“If anything has changed about my reading over the years, it is that I value the state a book puts me in more than I value the specific contents,” argued Birkerts, and perhaps that seemed precious three decades ago, but it strikes me as invaluable today. After all, <em>reading </em>itself remains literally central to our existence, maybe more so now than at anytime in history. Our digital lives are mediated through words, whether the tumult of Twitter or the doom-scrolling of Reddit, the ever-present ping of texts and the flux of Facebook. Yet this is an estimably different experience than the immersion in <em>Wuthering Heights </em>or <em>Moby-Dick, Mrs. Dalloway </em>and <em>Ulysses. </em>What’s been sacrificed is not reading in the most prosaic sense, but the particular experience of a certain type of reading, perilously endangered among all of us attracted to the alluring siren-call of the smartphone ping.</p>
<p>Readerly “flow” allows for a submersion in another way of being, an expansion of possibilities and consciousness. It would be foolish to make that hackneyed, didactic argument that great literature produces good people—too many Nazis read Goethe and Schiller, after all—but to abandon deep reading is to jettison something intrinsic, precious, and singular. “I read novels to indulge in a concentrated and directed inner activity that parallels—and thereby tunes up, accentuates—my own inner life,” writes Birkerts. As much drawn to the digital void as is anybody else alive right now, I’ve had to focus my attention on reading, to prepare myself for dwelling amidst these strange places called novels, and that conscious dedication of time has made immeasurable difference.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p></div>
<p>Without that dedication—which is simply exercised desire—I’d have not recently ambled through the centuries-old haunted house that is the main character in Daniel Mason’s <em>North Woods </em>nor would I have been dizzied to be in the unreliable consciousness of the spy Sadie Smith in Rachel Kushner’s <em>Creation Lake, </em>travelled across the immeasurable expanse of Eurasia in the years after the Great War with Pinto in Aleksander Hemon’s <em>The World and All that it Holds, </em>or become familiar with the dozens of very human characters in Andrew O’Hagan’s <em>Caledonian Road, </em>from beleaguered Gen-X art history professors to human trafficked Polish immigrants, British Lords to East London hip-hop artists, a universe in its entirety, contained between two covers of stiff cardboard and eternalized on 624 pages. Books are capable of altering Birkerts’ vaunted interiority, of bending the space-time continuum. As Katya Apekina writes in <em>Mother Doll, </em>another universe I visited this year, “Time does not exist…but it’s interminable.”</p>
<span>A printed book is a living animal with flesh of paper and ink of blood, so that compared to turning pages, mere scrolling is anemic.</span>
<p>Birkerts isn’t necessarily a print mystic, but I am. Mine is an estimably materialist variety of mysticism though, for meaning is the ghost within the machine of the book. Appropriate that Gutenberg, that German gold-miner by training, was inspired to create the matrix of movable print after seeing a similar mechanism used to press grapes into wine, both contraptions intended to distill spirits of-a-sort. The ephemerality of the internet is attractive to entropy, for how much of what’s been written over the past few decades has all but vanished, our prodigious output a daily burning of the Library of Alexandria, while stone, papyrus, vellum, and paper can endure for centuries. A printed book is a living animal with flesh of paper and ink of blood, so that compared to turning pages, mere scrolling is anemic.</p>
<p>The internet is, regardless of the encomiums of its most fervent supporters, also a physical realm. Despite being composed of silicon and copper, soldering and circuit boards, the internet is still described as an ethereal, disembodied, spiritual realm. This fallacy has been present for nearly a third-of-a-century and embraced with disturbing zealousness by Silicon Valley’s most cracked digital occultists. But mere affectation doesn’t draw me to the book, but that it’s superior at what it does. The codex on which the architecture of the book is still defined remains an essential technology.</p>
<p>Irene Vallelejo in <em>Papyrus: The Invention of Books in the Ancient World </em>quips that the codex is the rare device that a time traveling classical Roman would recognize, the book included alongside shovels and axes in basically appearing the same over the centuries. What makes the book perfect, and thus not in need of change, isn’t its appearance (they can be both beautiful and ugly), their price (they’re both expensive and cheap), or their sturdiness (some last forever, others not so much), but rather their ability to <em>disconnect. </em>That is the source of the interiority that Birkerts describes, that books are not mired in the cacophony of the internet.</p>
<p>Among the most poignant scenes in contemporary literature, ever pertinent today, is Winston Smith in George Orwell’s <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four </em>cradling his paper diary out of view of the panopticon of his telescreen and privately writing down his opinions. Except the telescreen isn’t all-seeing, it’s downright primitive compared to contemporary surveillance capitalism, where Big Brother doesn’t eavesdrop but Alexa does. By contrast, printed books are a zone of resistance against the neon god of the algorithm since tinkering with code can’t delete their contents, as hackers recently did with the Internet Archive. There is a safety to books, where Smith is able to enter the private realm of literature simply by sitting a bit off camera. That’s a freedom which, I fear, will become increasingly rare.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p></div>
<p>When we speak of twentieth-century totalitarianism we often due so with a sense of naivety, as if the worst of the past was safely ensconced there, mistaking technological progress with liberty. Now, consider what the Nazis were able to do with flimsy IBM punch cards, and the difference today, the sheer amount of data concerning all of us, saved on servers owned by the very people now enabling authoritarianism. “If literature is to survive,” wrote Birkerts, “it must become dangerous”—it increasingly is. More importantly, if we’re to survive, then we must become literate, again.</p>

<p><strong>Collective Intelligence for AI and Human Consensus</strong></p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Conversational Game Theory</strong> is a formal game of messaging, replies and tagging between human or AI agents that addresses qualitative, reasoning-intensive challenges while synthesizing multiple perspectives through high stakes conflict resolution and consensus building through narrative structures and feedback loops.</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="960" height="540" src="https://aikiwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Feed-Forward-Flow-Chart-14.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://aikiwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Feed-Forward-Flow-Chart-14.jpg 960w, https://aikiwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Feed-Forward-Flow-Chart-14-300x169.jpg 300w, https://aikiwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Feed-Forward-Flow-Chart-14-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></figure>



<p>This functions as a <a href="https://aikiwiki.com/conversational-game-theory-cgt-a-meta-system-of-collaborative-intelligence/" data-type="page" data-id="630">collective intelligence messaging and composition system</a> designed to handle subjective truths, conflict, collaboration, and complex human-AI interactions in consensus building that is interoperable with any system through an API layer.</p>



<p>As a complete system, Conversational Game Theory identifies a dynamic equilibrium between computational, cognitive and psychological states.</p>



<p>While traditional game theory focuses on strategies between rational agents–Conversational Game Theory is designed for rational and irrational participants or perspectives.</p>



<p>It utilizes a computer interface and a computational system to publish articles from conversations between agents and humans that we’ve recently piloted to success on parley.aikiwiki.com</p>

<p>We propose <strong>AI for Global Conflict Resolution</strong> as a public good that functions as an enhancement layer for LLMs, social media or governance platforms.</p>



<h2>Global Conflict Resolution and Consensus Library (Systems 1)</h2>



<p>Our ability to train AI Agents to play <strong>Conversational Game Theory</strong> from all possible perspectives means we can take any conflict in the world, train AI on all possible perspectives in the conflict, and publish transparent consensus resolutions to those conflicts. The system is immutable to subversion from bad faith actors. </p>



<p><a href="https://aikiwiki.com/conversational-game-theory-cgt-a-collaborative-consensus-building-game/">Humans can join in at anytime.</a></p>



<h2>AI Agent training protocol (Systems 2)</h2>



<p>This Global Library of Consensus Articles acts as <a href="https://aikiwiki.com/contextual-completeness-benchmark-testing-for-llms/">an enhancement layer for chain of thought reasoning for LLMs</a>, as well as a Systems 2 playground to train <a href="https://aikiwiki.com/intelligence-agents-for-a-collaborative-digital-future/" data-type="page" data-id="655">AI agents to play Conversational Game Theory.</a></p>



<h3>Perfect conversations are made possible through <strong>Conversational Game Theory.</strong></h3>



<p>Conversational Game Theory (CGT) engages conflict, debate, disagreement, contradiction, and questioning to <a href="https://aikiwiki.com/conversational-game-theory-cgt-a-collaborative-consensus-building-game/" data-type="link" data-id="https://aikiwiki.com/conversational-game-theory-cgt-a-collaborative-consensus-building-game/">evolve consensus to its best possible state.</a> </p>



<p>CGT makes both humans and AI <em>smarter.</em></p>



<p><strong>CGT achieves large transparent consensus <em>without</em> voting algorithms, enhancing dialogue <em>without </em>censoring any perspective.</strong></p>



<p>Conversely, <em>bad conversations yield bad results</em>.  <em>Bad conversations can make both humans and AI dumber</em>.</p>



<p><strong>While there’s fear that AI and Large Language Models might harm society, perhaps that damage has already occurred due to web 2.0.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>However, AI and LLMs can solve this problem that web2.0 created and make the web great again using <strong>Conversational Game Theory.</strong></p>



<p>We’ve<a href="https://aikiwiki.com/how-to-parley-aiki-wiki/"> demonstrated</a> that LLMs and AI agents can be trained to play <strong>Conversational Game Theory</strong> from all perspectives, embrace contradictions, explore misunderstandings, and produce superior benchmark scores, i.e. <em>CGT makes AI smarter!</em></p>

	It was a scene ripped from a John le Carré novel.</p>



<p>
	According to firsthand accounts and court documents, a man is told to go to the front desk of the Four Seasons Hotel in downtown Manhattan and say the phrase “banana peel.” The concierge then hands him an envelope with orders to circle the block twice before receiving further instructions. He returns, is shuffled into a secret elevator — one that isn’t even used for celebrities, only visiting dignitaries deemed assassination risks — and brought to the penthouse suite.</p>



<p>
	After 15 minutes, Sun Lijun enters the room and lights a cigarette. The man recognizes Sun, not merely because he is the third-highest-ranking official in China. In fact, they had met during a trip the man took to Hong Kong in which Chinese Communist Party officials confiscated his passport, blindfolded him and drove him into mainland China. Sun doesn’t greet the man sitting on a plush couch at the Four Seasons. Instead, the CCP bigwig pulls out an email from Attorney General Jeff Sessions regarding three American hostages being held in China. One is a pregnant woman. Sun asks the man what should be done about the woman. He suggests that in an act of good faith, she should be released. Sun makes a call, and after a few minutes, shows the man an itinerary — proof that the woman will be freed and flown back to the United States. A week later, at the tail end of 2018, the feds close in on the man as he walks into Lure, his favorite SoHo haunt.

	</p>






<p>
	But here’s the part that le Carré’s editors would have rejected as wildly implausible. The man is <a href="https://variety.com/t/pras-michel/" id="auto-tag_pras-michel" data-tag="pras-michel">Pras Michél</a>, founder of the legendary hip-hop band the <a href="https://variety.com/t/fugees/" id="auto-tag_fugees" data-tag="fugees">Fugees</a>. And his life is about to descend into chaos as he becomes the highest profile target in a labyrinthine criminal corruption case stemming from one of the world’s biggest financial scandals — the $4.5 billion looting of Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund known as 1MDB.

	</div>




<p>
	“I don’t know if subconsciously it was a bit exciting for me too,” Michél recalls in his first interview since being convicted in that case. “I like spy movies, but I never wanted to be a spy. I don’t think that’s sexy. But a part of it felt like that.”</p>



<p>
	If there was one red flag that something was off that night, Michél says it was the elevator. As a celebrity who has performed before crowds of 100,000, Michél was familiar with being whisked in and out of hotels by security. This was … different.

	</p>




<p>
	“I’m going to tell you what was weird to me: the fact that the Four Seasons has a private elevator. I never knew that. They have a private elevator for just certain people,” he says. “But my life leading up to that point felt surreal, so part of that night felt natural.”</p>



<p>
	Last April, a jury convicted Michél on 10 counts, including violating campaign finance laws during Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection bid and illegally lobbying the Donald Trump administration in 2017. The circus-like D.C. trial lasted three weeks and featured Leonardo DiCaprio testifying for the prosecution and everyone from Kim Kardashian to Martin Scorsese name-checked during testimony.</p>



<p>
	“Michél played a central role in a wide-ranging conspiracy to improperly influence top government officials, including the then-president [Trump] and the then-attorney general [Sessions],” said Department of Justice special agent in charge Harry Lidsky. Likewise, Luis Quesada, assistant director of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division, claimed that Michél “brazenly conspired to help a foreign national launder millions of dollars in illegitimate campaign contributions into the 2012 U.S. presidential election.”</p>



<p>
	In short, the government dubbed Michél a Chinese spy, and a jury agreed. He now faces 22 years in federal prison.</p>



<p>
	“Technically, I’m a foreign agent,” he says.</p>



<p>
	How a Yale-educated musical prodigy who made up one-third of a Grammy-winning group got caught up in this mess makes it one of the most riveting celebrity sagas in years. At the center of the tale is Jho Low, the wild-spending financier who burst onto the scene in 2013 by backing “The Wolf of Wall Street,” Scorsese and DiCaprio’s $100 million look at financial fraud and bacchanalian excess. As Low’s influence in Hollywood grew, scores of celebrities partied on his private jet, drank his Cristal and accepted his lavish gifts (DiCaprio landed a $3.2 million Picasso and a $9 million Basquiat), at least until his elaborate embezzlement scheme unraveled and he became a fugitive. For his part, Michél entered Low’s circle after the two were connected in 2006 via a party promoter who caters to the rich and shameless.</p>



<p>
	Low’s world extended beyond Hollywood to include political operatives — like Democrat Frank White Jr., a relation of Michelle Obama by marriage, and Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy — who did his bidding. White has never been charged, while Trump later pardoned Broidy. Michél says he and Low were never friends, but he connected the deep-pocketed newcomer to other VIPs. He remains the only one in Low’s orbit to face real consequences.</p>



<p>
	“The government needed a prize. They needed a head, and he was the low-hanging fruit,” says Robert Meloni, a litigator on Michél’s team.</p>



<p>
	On an overcast September day in New York, Michél, now 52, takes me down the rabbit hole. We meet in his sparsely furnished 4,500-square-foot SoHo apartment with floor-to-ceiling views of lower Manhattan — a maroon couch, a baby grand piano and a shelf showcasing his Grammys are the only signs of occupancy. The walls are completely bare save for a giant TV. You might assume the government confiscated Michél’s furnishings. But you’d be wrong.

	</p>




<p>
	“I’m a minimalist,” he explains.</p>



<p>
	Wearing a gray Dolce &amp; Gabbana T-shirt with “Love Is King” emblazoned on the front, jeans, pink socks and sandals, Michél exudes a post-yoga-class calm despite a looming sentencing date in January.</p>



<p>
	“I’m going to fight, and I’m going to appeal, but there’s a possibility that I’m going <em>in</em> while I’m fighting,” he says. “It’s just the reality.”</p>



<p>
	Michél was charged under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a once rare maneuver. From 1967 to 2018, the feds only brought forward 12 criminal cases under FARA. But there has been a newfound zeal over the past six years, particularly against members of the Trump administration. Michél says the feds even threatened to use the Logan Act against him. Only two people have ever been indicted under the Logan Act. Adding to his woes, the government seized roughly $80 million from him. In the initial indictment, officials accused him and Low of illegally trying to “obtain foreign access to, and influence with, high-ranking United States government officials for financial benefit.”</p>



<p>
	“Every aspect of my life has been disrupted. I can’t bank anywhere, been kicked out of 13 banks,” Michél says.</p>



<p>
	Still, there are hints of wealth on display. A vintage Patek Philippe watch adorns one of Michél’s wrists, and Cartier and Tiffany bracelets hang on the other. Michél insists that he was never motivated by money. Instead, after the Fugees disbanded in 1997, he continued to land Grammy nominations as the artist behind the seminal “Ghetto Supastar (That Is What You Are),” but he also became a documentarian who traveled to dangerous locations to make gonzo films like “Skid Row” (embedding in L.A.’s homeless community) and “Sweet Micky for President” (which chronicled Michel Martelly’s bid for Haiti’s presidency amid civil unrest unleashed by the 2010 earthquake). He got comfortable being uncomfortable.</p>



<p>
	“I love being able to go stay at the penthouse in the Ritz-Carlton and then being in some fucking locked-up dungeon in Somalia eating rice with my hands,” he says. “When I was kidnapped [there], they were about to sell me to Al-Shabaab, the terrorist group. We were trying to do a documentary. I remember my director was freaking out. He was going crazy. He’s like, ‘Yo, you have a death wish on you, Pras. I should have never listened to you.’ I said, ‘Well, look at it like this. You shot some stuff. Maybe the footage would get back to the States. If we die, at least we got to tell a great story.’ He’s like, ‘What the fuck? What you mean a great story?’ And obviously State Department came and got us out.”</p>

	Perhaps that’s why he was unfazed by Low’s cartoonish grandiosity and the strange asks he began to make. Low threw money around like a sultan, hosting Vegas birthday bashes and Cannes blowouts. But in 2012, as the feds closed in, Low struggled to keep his fraud operation from being exposed. The Malaysian financier tried to leverage his White House ties. He turned to Michél, an Obama fundraiser, and offered him $20 million for a photograph with the president. Michél obliged and kept most of the money. His thinking was rich people will spare no expense to meet famous people.

	</p>




<p>
	“I know people like [Low] who legitimately have money, and they’re wild,” he explains. “If they want something, they’re going to go through all means to get it because they have the resources to. People say, ‘People do crazy things,’ but they haven’t actually witnessed it. I’ve witnessed it.”</p>



<p>
	Case in point, the billionaire who lives on the top floor of his SoHo building.</p>



<p>
	“This guy wanted a statue. They literally shut down this whole block for a whole day, had to bring a crane, had to literally do a hole in the roof to bring the statue he wanted in, and then they redid the roof. He paid for it, obviously. But the roof is not his. It’s for the building. But he’s a billionaire, so it’s like … ,” he says with a shrug.</p>



<p>
	And Low’s spending kept him on the government’s radar. As his house of cards teetered, he tapped his political connections and turned to Michél again. With the turnover from Obama to Trump, Low hoped the new administration would go easy on him and unfreeze his assets. That’s where the Chinese government fit in. During the Hong Kong trip Michél took with Low, the CCP conveyed that it wanted the United States to extradite a fugitive named Guo Wengui. In exchange, it would release three U.S. prisoners, including the pregnant woman. The scheme faced obstacles, namely that Guo happened to be a Steve Bannon pal and a member at Donald Trump’s club, Mar-a-Lago.</p>



<p>
	By the time of the Four Seasons meeting, which Low orchestrated, Michél was already in the feds’ crosshairs. When the FBI began asking him questions, the rapper never requested a lawyer, believing that his actions were legal. After all, he was being advised by George Higginbotham, a senior congressional affairs specialist at the Department of Justice.</p>



<p>
	“The one person that I relied on, especially legally, didn’t give me the best advice,” Michél says. “That’s his job. I’m an artist. There’s a reason why you rely on your legal counsel. They’re the one that’s going to sit here and tell you, ‘Nah. OK, if you want to do this, do it this way so you don’t have any exposure.’ So if my representative is sanctioning what I’m doing and my representative coincidentally works for the DOJ, I am not going to sit here and think I’m wrong, right?” (Higginbotham did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>



<p>
	The prosecution claimed that Michél netted more than $100 million from his association with Low. When I ask if that figure is accurate, he declines to comment. In 2020, a year after Michél was charged, the feds offered him a plea deal. But he turned it down, maintaining that he did nothing wrong. Still, the Trump administration’s DOJ never moved forward with the case. Despite his Obama ties, the Biden administration did.</p>



<p>
	“All the real players escaped,” says a high-profile attorney who followed the case. “Pras was the little guy who took the fall.”</p>



<p>
	For his part, Higginbotham pleaded guilty to conspiracy to deceive U.S. banks about millions of dollars in foreign lobbying funds and was sentenced to three months’ probation. He testified against Michél. As for some of the other characters in the sprawling narrative, Guo was convicted in the U.S. of defrauding investors and supporters of $1 billion.

	</p>




<p>
	“When the feds went into his $30 million apartment on Park Avenue, the apartment was remotely blown up. Did you know that?” Michél says, awestruck. “I guess all the evidence was in the apartment. Whatever. Allegedly, it wasn’t him [who detonated the bomb], but somebody blew the apartment up remotely while the feds were coming in.” (The FBI and the New York Fire Department reportedly were investigating a mysterious 2023 fire that broke out as authorities entered the luxury abode.)</p>



<p>
	Meanwhile, a court in China sentenced Sun to death in 2022 for taking bribes, with the chance that the sentence be reduced to life in prison without parole. Low escaped the United States and is believed to be living in China.</p>



<p>
	“He has as much freedom as someone in a phone booth,” Michél says of the man who turned his life upside down. “Without getting too philosophical about it, it was about me being at the right place at the wrong time. Or the wrong place at the right time.”</p>



<p>
	By the time Michél’s trial began, it appeared as though he had hired the wrong attorney in David Kenner, best known for representing Suge Knight in his 2015 murder case. He had little experience with white-collar crime. He allowed Michél to testify, an unorthodox move that rarely helps a defendant. In an absurd twist, Kenner reportedly used an AI-generated closing argument. “The court has adjudicated those three issues, and they have been denied,” Kenner says. (Earlier this year, Kenner pleaded guilty to misdemeanor criminal contempt and was sentenced to one year of probation over his handling of discovery materials in Michél’s case.)</p>



<p>
	Michél is now represented by Peter Zeidenberg. “We continue to believe that Mr. Michél was not afforded a fair trial, and that the jury’s verdict should be overturned,” Zeidenberg says. “We plan to appeal this verdict and believe that Mr. Michél will, ultimately, be fully exonerated.”</p>



<p>
	The story seems ripe for the Hollywood treatment, and at least three books on the subject are already in the works. Idris Elba has also approached Michél’s camp about acquiring his life rights, and there will be a documentary centering on Michél’s Zelig-like involvement in the surreal story. Director Ben Patterson unveiled footage of the project during a secret screening at the Toronto Film Festival in September. The audience sat in stunned silence, he says. Some of it was shot by Michél, who was brave (or crazy) enough to keep his camera on during the meeting with Sun in China.</p>



<p>
	“There’s so many people that were connected to this,” Patterson says. “It just is surprising and appalling that Pras is the one that gets singled out to the extent that he has. But in doing so, he exposed a lot about how government, celebrity and global finance are all intertwined.”</p>



<p>
	As Michél sits inside the place that he will call home for at least a few more months, he reflects on the people who abandoned him. No publicist would touch him or his case, fearing that they, too, would become entangled in a criminal investigation. Erica Dumas, a crisis publicist with D.C. ties who once worked for Sen. John Kerry, was the only one who would agree to work with him. Friends also began to keep their distance.

	</p>




<p>
	In 2020, right before the pandemic hit, two federal agents visit the L.A. home of one of his closest buddies, who is married with three daughters.</p>



<p>
	“Look, you get a call, FBI show up to your place, I don’t care who you are, your heart is going up your throat,” he says. “They’re like, ‘Hey, we just got a couple of questions for you. So can we come in?’ Who’s going to say no? So he let them in. The wife comes, sits in the living room, don’t know what’s going on, but she’s scared. And at some point, one of the agents goes, ‘What’s that? Do you smell that?’ The wife defecated on herself. She was that scared. And the wife later told my friend, ‘If you ever speak to Pras again, I’ll take my three daughters and you’ll never see us again.’”</p>

<p>
	And though he doesn’t say their names, it’s apparent that his former Fugees bandmates Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean are among those who ghosted him.</p>



<p>
	“I’m done with that. They’re going to Europe [to tour]. I can’t go, so,” he says of the conditions of his bail that prevent him from leaving the country. “It’s what it is. You can’t give people that kind of energy. So you could be frustrated, you could be disappointed, but I really believe in my path and in my journey, and I believe what’s mine, no one’s going to be able to take it away from me. So it’s better that you have a small group of people who really believe in you and believe in what you’re doing than to have 100 people around you, and the minute something happens — boom. People just disappear.”</p>



<p>
	A few weeks after our meeting, Michél files a blistering lawsuit against Hill, accusing her of fraud and breach of contract over the Fugees’ 2023 reunion tour that ended abruptly this year amid a slew of canceled concerts. It left little doubt about his feelings toward his former colleague. (In the shade-filled complaint, he claimed Hill showed “arrogance” for “unilaterally” rejecting a $5 million offer to play Coachella, alleging her “ego was bruised” because No Doubt got top billing over the Fugees. Hill hit back, calling the lawsuit “baseless” and “full of false claims and unwarranted attacks.”)</p>



<p>
	Michél makes his way to the baby grand. He’s thinking about his 6-year-old daughter. For most of our interview, he speaks flatly, seeming both resigned and exhausted. But he grows animated as he begins talking about the girl he calls “my joy.” She lives part of the year in Italy, making it difficult to see her given that he has to stay in the U.S. But she traveled to Los Angeles with her mother recently, giving him renewed hope. Over the past few days, a song lodged in his head like an earworm. He didn’t know how to play it, so he taught himself.</p>



<p>
	As the midday sun breaks through the clouds, Michél begins tapping out an unmistakable melody on the piano. It’s the Jackson 5’s “I’ll Be There.”

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://proot-me.github.io/">https://proot-me.github.io/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42262308">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div xmlns="" id="description"><h2>Description</h2><p>PRoot is a user-space implementation of <tt>chroot</tt>, <tt>mount --bind</tt>,
and <tt>binfmt_misc</tt>.  This means that users don't need any privileges
or setup to do things like using an arbitrary directory as the new
root filesystem, making files accessible somewhere else in the
filesystem hierarchy, or executing programs built for another CPU
architecture transparently through QEMU user-mode.  Also, developers
can use PRoot as a generic Linux process instrumentation engine thanks
to its extension mechanism, see <a href="https://proot-me.github.io/care">CARE</a> for an example.  Technically
PRoot relies on <tt>ptrace</tt>, an unprivileged system-call available in
every Linux kernel.</p><p>The new root file-system, a.k.a <em>guest rootfs</em>, typically contains a
Linux distribution.  By default PRoot confines the execution of
programs to the guest rootfs only, however users can use the built-in
<em>mount/bind</em> mechanism to access files and directories from the actual
root file-system, a.k.a <em>host rootfs</em>, just as if they were part of
the guest rootfs.</p><p>When the guest Linux distribution is made for a CPU architecture
incompatible with the host one, PRoot uses the CPU emulator QEMU
user-mode to execute transparently guest programs.  It's a convenient
way to develop, to build, and to validate any guest Linux packages
seamlessly on users' computer, just as if they were in a <em>native</em>
guest environment.  That way all of the cross-compilation issues are
avoided.</p><p>PRoot can also <em>mix</em> the execution of host programs and the execution
of guest programs emulated by QEMU user-mode.  This is useful to use
host equivalents of programs that are missing from the guest rootfs
and to speed up build-time by using cross-compilation tools or
CPU-independent programs, like interpreters.</p><p>It is worth noting that the guest kernel is never involved, regardless
of whether QEMU user-mode is used or not.  Technically, when guest
programs perform access to system resources, PRoot translates their
requests before sending them to the host kernel.  This means that
guest programs can use host resources (devices, network, ...) just as
if they were "normal" host programs.</p></div><div xmlns="" id="examples"><h2>Examples</h2><p>In the following examples the directories <tt>/mnt/slackware-8.0</tt> and
<tt>/mnt/armslack-12.2/</tt> contain a Linux distribution respectively made
for x86 CPUs and ARM CPUs.</p><div id="chroot\ equivalent"><h3><tt>chroot</tt> equivalent</h3><p>To execute a command inside a given Linux distribution, just give
<tt>proot</tt> the path to the guest rootfs followed by the desired
command.  The example below executes the program <tt>cat</tt> to print the
content of a file:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/ cat /etc/motd

Welcome to Slackware Linux 8.0</pre><p>The default command is <tt>/bin/sh</tt> when none is specified. Thus the
shortest way to confine an interactive shell and all its sub-programs
is:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/

$ cat /etc/motd
Welcome to Slackware Linux 8.0</pre></div><div id="mount\ --bind\ equivalent"><h3><tt>mount --bind</tt> equivalent</h3><p>The bind mechanism enables one to relocate files and directories.  This is
typically useful to trick programs that perform access to hard-coded
locations, like some installation scripts:</p><pre>proot -b /tmp/alternate_opt:/opt

$ cd to/sources
$ make install
[...]
install -m 755 prog "/opt/bin"
[...] # prog is installed in "/tmp/alternate_opt/bin" actually</pre><p>As shown in this example, it is possible to bind over files not even
owned by the user.  This can be used to <em>overlay</em> system configuration
files, for instance the DNS setting:</p><pre>ls -l /etc/hosts
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 675 Mar  4  2011 /etc/hosts</pre><pre>proot -b ~/alternate_hosts:/etc/hosts

$ echo '1.2.3.4 google.com' &gt; /etc/hosts
$ resolveip google.com
IP address of google.com is 1.2.3.4
$ echo '5.6.7.8 google.com' &gt; /etc/hosts
$ resolveip google.com
IP address of google.com is 5.6.7.8</pre><p>Another example: on most Linux distributions <tt>/bin/sh</tt> is a symbolic
link to <tt>/bin/bash</tt>, whereas it points to <tt>/bin/dash</tt> on Debian
and Ubuntu.  As a consequence a <tt>#!/bin/sh</tt> script tested with Bash
might not work with Dash.  In this case, the binding mechanism of
PRoot can be used to set non-disruptively <tt>/bin/bash</tt> as the default
<tt>/bin/sh</tt> on these two Linux distributions:</p><pre>proot -b /bin/bash:/bin/sh [...]</pre><p>Because <tt>/bin/sh</tt> is initially a symbolic link to <tt>/bin/dash</tt>, the
content of <tt>/bin/bash</tt> is actually bound over this latter:</p><pre>proot -b /bin/bash:/bin/sh

$ md5sum /bin/sh
089ed56cd74e63f461bef0fdfc2d159a  /bin/sh
$ md5sum /bin/bash
089ed56cd74e63f461bef0fdfc2d159a  /bin/bash
$ md5sum /bin/dash
089ed56cd74e63f461bef0fdfc2d159a  /bin/dash</pre><p>In most cases this shouldn't be a problem, but it is still possible to
strictly bind <tt>/bin/bash</tt> over <tt>/bin/sh</tt> -- without dereferencing
it -- by specifying the <tt>!</tt> character at the end:</p><pre>proot -b '/bin/bash:/bin/sh!'

$ md5sum /bin/sh
089ed56cd74e63f461bef0fdfc2d159a  /bin/sh
$ md5sum /bin/bash
089ed56cd74e63f461bef0fdfc2d159a  /bin/bash
$ md5sum /bin/dash
c229085928dc19e8d9bd29fe88268504  /bin/dash</pre></div><div id="chroot\ +\ mount\ --bind\ equivalent"><h3><tt>chroot</tt> + <tt>mount --bind</tt> equivalent</h3><p>The two features above can be combined to make any file from the host
rootfs accessible in the confined environment just as if it were
initially part of the guest rootfs.  It is sometimes required to run
programs that rely on some specific files:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/

$ ps -o tty,command
Error, do this: mount -t proc none /proc</pre><p>works better with:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/ -b /proc

$ ps -o tty,command
TT       COMMAND
?        bash
?        proot -b /proc /mnt/slackware-8.0/
?        sh
?        ps -o tty,command</pre><p>Actually there's a bunch of such specific files, that's why PRoot
provides the option <tt>-R</tt> to bind automatically a pre-defined list of
recommended paths:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/slackware-8.0/

$ ps -o tty,command
TT       COMMAND
pts/6    bash
pts/6    proot -R /mnt/slackware-8.0/
pts/6    sh
pts/6    ps -o tty,command</pre></div><div id="chroot\ +\ mount\ --bind\ +\ su\ equivalent"><h3><tt>chroot</tt> + <tt>mount --bind</tt> + <tt>su</tt> equivalent</h3><p>Some programs will not work correctly if they are not run by the
"root" user, this is typically the case with package managers.  PRoot
can fake the root identity and its privileges when the <tt>-0</tt> (zero)
option is specified:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/ -0

# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) [...]

# mkdir /tmp/foo
# chmod a-rwx /tmp/foo
# echo 'I bypass file-system permissions.' &gt; /tmp/foo/bar

I bypass file-system permissions.</pre><p>This option is typically required to create or install packages into
the guest rootfs.  Note it is <em>not</em> recommended to use the <tt>-R</tt>
option when installing packages since they may try to update bound
system files, like <tt>/etc/group</tt>.  Instead, it is recommended to use
the <tt>-S</tt> option.  This latter enables the <tt>-0</tt> option and binds
only paths that are known to not be updated by packages:</p><pre>proot -S /mnt/slackware-8.0/

# installpkg perl.tgz
Installing package perl...</pre></div><div id="chroot\ +\ mount\ --bind\ +\ binfmt_misc\ equivalent"><h3><tt>chroot</tt> + <tt>mount --bind</tt> + <tt>binfmt_misc</tt> equivalent</h3><p>PRoot uses QEMU user-mode to execute programs built for a CPU
architecture incompatible with the host one.  From users'
point-of-view, guest programs handled by QEMU user-mode are executed
transparently, that is, just like host programs.  To enable this
feature users just have to specify which instance of QEMU user-mode
they want to use with the option <tt>-q</tt>:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -q qemu-arm

$ cat /etc/motd
Welcome to ARMedSlack Linux 12.2</pre><p>The parameter of the <tt>-q</tt> option is actually a whole QEMU user-mode
command, for instance to enable its GDB server on port 1234:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -q "qemu-arm -g 1234" emacs</pre><p>PRoot allows one to mix transparently the emulated execution of guest
programs and the native execution of host programs in the same
file-system namespace.  It's typically useful to extend the list of
available programs and to speed up build-time significantly.  This
mixed-execution feature is enabled by default when using QEMU
user-mode, and the content of the host rootfs is made accessible
through <tt>/host-rootfs</tt>:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -q qemu-arm

$ file /bin/echo
[...] ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM [...]
$ /bin/echo 'Hello world!'
Hello world!

$ file /host-rootfs/bin/echo
[...] ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64 [...]
$ /host-rootfs/bin/echo 'Hello mixed world!'
Hello mixed world!</pre><p>Since both host and guest programs use the guest rootfs as <tt>/</tt>,
users may want to deactivate explicitly cross-filesystem support found
in most GNU cross-compilation tools.  For example with GCC configured
to cross-compile to the ARM target:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -q qemu-arm

$ export CC=/host-rootfs/opt/cross-tools/arm-linux/bin/gcc
$ export CFLAGS="--sysroot=/"   # could be optional indeed
$ ./configure; make</pre><p>As with regular files, a host instance of a program can be bound over
its guest instance.  Here is an example where the guest binary of
<tt>make</tt> is overlaid by the host one:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -q qemu-arm -b /usr/bin/make

$ which make
/usr/bin/make
$ make --version # overlaid
GNU Make 3.82
Built for x86_64-slackware-linux-gnu</pre><p>It's worth mentioning that even when mixing the native execution of
host programs and the emulated execution of guest programs, they still
believe they are running in a native guest environment.  As a
demonstration, here is a partial output of a typical <tt>./configure</tt>
script:</p><pre>checking whether the C compiler is a cross-compiler... no</pre></div></div><div xmlns="" id="downloads"><h2>Downloads</h2><div id=""><h3>PRoot</h3><p>The source code for PRoot and CARE are hosted in the same repository on <a href="https://github.com/proot-me/proot">GitHub</a>.

<p dir="auto">When Windows Defender mistakenly recognizes a batch file as a Trojan, this is often called a 'False Positive'. To solve this problem, you can go through the following steps:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>File exception handling: In Windows Defender, you can set certain files or processes to skip security scanning. To do this, follow the steps below:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Click the ‘Start’ button and go to ‘Settings’.</li>
<li>Click ‘Update &amp; Security’.</li>
<li>Select ‘Windows Security’ and go to ‘Virus &amp; threat protection’.</li>
<li>Click ‘Manage Virus &amp; Threat Protection Settings’.</li>
<li>Select 'Add exception' in 'Virus &amp; threat protection settings'.</li>
<li>Select 'File or Folder', find the batch file in question and add it as an exception.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Temporarily disable Windows Defender: This may be a temporary solution. However, you must be careful when using this method as it may expose your computer to other threats.</li>
<li>Report the problem to anti-virus software: If you are sure that the file is not a Trojan horse, you can report it to Microsoft as a False Positive. Microsoft will review this and take any necessary action.</li>

<p>In 1974, Professor Shawn Buckley ran an <a href="http://web.mit.edu/iap/">M.I.T. Independent Activities Period</a>
course where participants, including Marc Rosenbaum and Harriet Fell, got to build their own bicycle frames.  Marc Rosenbaum, then a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, set out to create a bicycle that would give a rider an acceleration advantage by being ultra light without sacrificing stiffness. In this paper, we describe some of Marc’s design, the frames he and Harriet built in the IAP course, and how these played a role in the Klein vs. Cannondale patent litigation in the mid-1980s.</p>

<h2>Marc Rosenbaum’s Aluminum Bicycle</h2>
<p>In 1974, Marc Rosenbaum was a senior at M.I.T. majoring in mechanical engineering. The goal of his undergraduate thesis (<a href="http://sheldonbrown.com/MarcRosenbaumThesis.pdf">Rosenbaum 1974</a>) project was to create and describe
a bicycle that would give a rider an acceleration advantage by being ultra light without sacrificing stiffness. Marc stressed stiffness over strength, pointing out that “frames never break in normal racing conditions, which indicates that strength is not a problem.” Clearly things have changed since carbon fiber bicycles have entered the racing scene though the problem is not their resistance to normal loads encountered during rides but to impact damage.</p>

<p>In 1974, normal track bikes weighed 18 or 19 pounds. There are lighter bikes today; the I.C.U. minimum weight limit is 6.8 kg, which is about 15 pounds. There were also some lighter bikes in 1974. A bicycle made for Eddy Merckx in 1971, which he rode to set the one-hour record (30.715 mi), weighed only 13.25 pounds. It had a very light steel frame, custom built titanium handlebars, stem, and seatpost, partially plastic pedals, 24-spoke wheels, and tires expected to last at most 4 hours on a smooth board track. The components were extensively drilled out. This bicycle was not designed for strength or to last (<a href="http://sheldonbrown.com/MarcRosenbaumThesis.pdf">Rosenbaum 1974</a>).</p>

<strong>The bicycle built by Marc Rosenbaum weighing 12 lbs. 5oz.</strong>
</p>

<h2>Marc’s Design Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use larger diameter tubular components</strong> - Strength goes up as the cube<sup><a href="#Foot1">1</a></sup> of the diameter so unless there are geometric constraints, use larger diameter tubes with thinner walls to get a lighter structure with increased strength and stiffness.</li>
<li><strong>Use sealed precision bearings</strong> - higher quality and lighter.</li>
<li><strong>Sacrifice adjustability</strong> - adjustment features add weight.</li>
<li><strong>Use alloys</strong> – Marc settled on 6061-T6 aluminum where welding was needed and used 2024-T4 aluminum and titanium (Ti 6Al 4V) in other places. He ruled out magnesium, which is best per unit weight in compressive buckling but is brittle and difficult to extrude. He noted that aluminum is easier to weld and fabricate than titanium and more than twice as efficient as steel against compressive buckling. The walls in existing steel tubes were already down to .020” - .025” and would be prone to buckling if they were made thinner to compensate for increased diameter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Frame</h2>
<p>The table below shows the tube lengths and thicknesses that Marc used in his frame.
The frame was put into a jig to hold it in alignment and was joined by tungsten-inert-gas welding. After welding, it was heat-treated (annealed) to relieve stresses induced by welding and to bring the aluminum back up to its initial strength. The top tube sagged about 1/32 of an inch during annealing. This was apparently due to the greatly decreased strength of the aluminum at the high temperature of the heat treatment process.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Bracket</h2>
<p>The bottom bracket was bored out to press fit the bearings directly into it. The result is a highly accurate and simple system. A Teledyne titanium axle was modified to accept the precision bearings. The axle saved three ounces and the bearings were 2.5 ounces lighter than the conventional bearing arrangement.</p>

<h2>The Hubs</h2>
<p>The body of the rear hub is of 2024-T4 aluminum. It was bored out for precision sealed bearings and has a hollow titanium axle. It weighs only 5 ounces vs. 11.5 ounces for standard track rear hubs. Similar construction was used for the front hub. It weighed only 3 ounces vs. 9 ounces for a conventional hub.</p>

<h2>The Pedals</h2>

  <figcaption>Marc's pedal</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The pedals were designed to be comfortable, easy to get into (with toe clips), and to allow sharp cornering. They have platforms of 2024-T4 aluminum on which the whole ball of the rider’s foot can rest. The axle is of titanium and is threaded to fit a standard crank. The bearings are pressed into the pedal body and onto the axle. The pair of pedals weighs 7.5 ounces, 5 ounces less than the lightest track pedals of the time.</p>

<h2>The Saddle</h2>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.sheldonbrown.com/images/MarcBike/saddle250.jpg" alt="Marc's saddle" width="250">
  <figcaption>Marc's saddle</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The saddle is a prime example of eliminating unneeded adjustability. Marc determined his saddle-to-pedal distance on another bicycle and decided on an integral seatpost/saddle for the bike. The result is a savings of nearly a pound.</p>

<h2>Handlebars and Stem</h2>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.sheldonbrown.com/images/MarcBike/handlebars250.jpg" alt="Marc's handlebars and stem" width="250">
  <figcaption>Marc's handlebars and stem</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Track bikes have the bars down low to put the rider into an efficient sprint position. Track riders often use only one position. Marc attached the handlebars directly to the fork crown, reducing weight and increasing rigidity. A simple, wide shallow U-shaped handlebar was attached via the handlebar-mounting end of a steel stem silver-soldered to a steel strip that was in turn silver-soldered to the top of the fork crown. This arrangement saved almost a pound.</p>

<h2>Other Components</h2>
<p>The wheels used Hi-E Engineering tubular rims and Pirelli Specialissimo Corsa Leggero tires. The track sprocket, chain, and T.A. cotterless 48 tooth chainring were standard. The bike initially had an 18-tooth rear sprocket for a gear of 72 inches. The headset was Stronglight Competition, and a Raleigh road-racing fork was modified to give the required wheel clearance and the design fork rake of 1.5 inches.</p>

<p>The bicycle that Marc built for his undergraduate thesis project was the world'’'s lightest track bicycle at that time. The finished bicycle was as rigid as a normal sprint track bicycle and with wheels built up for road riding, weighed 12 pounds, 5 ounces. The bicycle is currently at the M.I.T. Museum.

<h2>Harriet Fell's Aluminum Bicycle</h2>
<p>In 1974, Harriet Fell was an Assistant Professor of mathematics at Northeastern University, across the river from M.I.T. The (<a href="http://web.mit.edu/iap/">M.I.T. Independent Activities Period</a>) is a special four-week term at M.I.T. that runs during the month of January.<sup><a href="#Foot2">2</a></sup> In 1974, Professor Shawn Buckley offered an Aluminum Bike Project class. This was an opportunity for students to build their own aluminum bicycle frames. The tubes suggested for the class were of a smaller diameter and had thicker walls than the ones Marc decided to use. Harriet showed up and ordered a set of tubes.</p>

<p>She designed her frame by using some measurements (e.g. top tube, seat tube, and the angle between them) from her favorite bicycle, a Holdsworth Strada. Working with the constraints of the wider tubes and her small size (5' 2") and making sure to leave enough space for 700C wheels, she made an accurate half-size drawing of the planned frame. She then measured the lengths of the other tubes from the drawing. With advice and instruction from Marc, Shawn, and the machine shop staff, she learned to use a metal lathe and milling machine enough to machine the tubes and dropouts for her bicycle. She put the parts into a jig, and Shawn sent it off for welding. Shawn said that the completed frame was particularly light and strong. (The fact that it was made for someone only 5' 2" tall surely had something to do with this. A frame for Eddy Merckx at 6' 1" would surely have weighed more.) Shawn demonstrated the strength of the frame by laying it on its side and standing/bouncing on the seat stays.<sup><a href="#Foot3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Gary Klein also made a frame in this project in the spring of 1974 and got even wider tubes to make a larger frame.</p>

<h2>Harriet’s Frame Goes to France</h2>
<p>Just after finishing the frame, Harriet moved to France to continue her career in mathematics. She also started cycling with the cyclosport group at the Faculté de Science at Orsay. She got as far as mounting a headset and fork on her frame, but math and cycling, including riding the <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/fell/PBP1975.html">1975 Paris-Brest-Paris</a>, filled most of her time. In September 1976, unable to extend her leave of absence for another year, she returned to Northeastern University. As she was determined to move back to France, she left her frame, a large bag of books and clothes, and a pile of tubular tires in a friend’s cellar. She did spend another year in France, but not until 1988/1989 with her husband, Sheldon Brown, and their children Tova and George. The clothes and books were intact. The tubulars had hardened to a rock-like state and were unusable. The frame met another fate.</p>

<h2>Cannondale</h2>
<p>In 1983, Cannondale manufactured its first aluminum bicycle (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannondale_Bicycle_Corporation">Wikipedia 2016</a>). Gary Klein had been issued patents on aluminum bicycle frames and sued Cannondale for patent infringement. Schwinn was already making large-diameter aluminum frames and paid Klein license fees. Cannondale claimed that Klein was not entitled to his patent(s) because the real design came out of Marc Rosenbaum's thesis and the 1974 Aluminum Bike Project (<a href="https://www.bikeforums.net/classic-vintage/601292-aluminum-revolution.html">Bike Forums mtnbke 2009</a>)(<a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/884/1399/464210/">Justia 1989</a>) Marc Rosenbaum was subpoenaed in the Cannondale/Klein case and gave a 6-hour videotaped deposition. He hid his bicycle in a friend’s barn so it wouldn’t be subpoenaed. He was afraid he would lose the bicycle for years and possibly never get it back if it were taken.</p>

<p>Cannondale’s lawyer wanted frame(s) that were built before Klein’s for the case. He contacted Shawn Buckley who told him that there were five light/strong frames produced in the project. The lawyer called Harriet to ask if he could use her frame and she said, “Yes, but it’s in a friend’s cellar in France.” He visited her friends and brought the frame back for the trial.</p>

<p>Bringing in large diameter aluminum frames built by Bill Shook, founder and engineer of <a href="https://amclassic.com/company">American Classic </a>, and by Harriet Fell that predated Mr. Klein’s, Cannondale successfully argued that the Klein patent was null and void due to "prior art" - you can’t patent something that’s already in existence and known publicly (<a href="https://www.bikeforums.net/classic-vintage/601292-aluminum-revolution.html">Bike Forums tcs 2009</a>).</p>

<p>Klein's patent discovery documents had referenced Marc's bike and thesis numerous times, and it had taken Klein almost eight years to be granted a patent. Essentially, Cannondale asked, "Why is Klein's bike different from Rosenbaum's frame?"</p>



<h2>From Frame to Bike</h2>
<p>Marc was right to fear losing his bicycle for many years if it were subpoenaed. Cannondale kept Harriet's frame for many years and never let her know where it actually was. Eventually she asked her husband, Sheldon Brown, who worked in the bicycle business, to call a friend at Cannondale and ask for the frame. That worked. When the frame arrived, Sheldon hung it high on a living room wall and told every visitor about it.</p>

<p>In May 2005, Sheldon asked Harriet what she wanted for Mother's Day. She said, "Sheldon, since we've been married you've built up about 40 bikes for yourself (<a href="https://sheldonbrown.com/org/bicycle.html">Sheldon Brown's Personal Bicycle Page</a>) so how about getting that one on the road for me." 
He built the aluminum frame up with standard, fairly light-weight parts. Harriet has recently changed the saddle to a Brooks Cambium and added lights, a Quad-Lock mount for an iPhone, and a small frame bag with USB charger, all easily removable.

<h2>Proof in the Riding</h2>
<p>Marc Rosenbaum rode his bicycle up Mount Washington twice<sup><a href="#Foot4">4</a></sup> before donating it to the MIT Museum. Bill Shook rode his homemade bicycle frame in several races (<a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/884/1399/464210/">Justia 1989</a>). Harriet Fell continues to ride hers around the western suburbs of Boston.</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<p><a id="Foot1"></a>1. From correspondence from Marc Rosenbaum: "For solid tubes, section modulus is proportional to radius (or diameter) cubed, so strength increases with the cube of diameter. Moment of inertia is proportional to diameter to the fourth power, so stiffness increases with the fourth power of diameter.<br>For hollow tubes, it's not as cut and dried. If you double the diameter and double the wall thickness, then strength goes up as the cube and stiffness as the fourth power. If the wall thickness remains constant, doubling the diameter doesn't increase strength by 8 and stiffness by 16."</p>
<p><a id="Foot2"></a>2. It is an opportunity for MIT students, faculty and staff to organize or participate in a wide variety of courses ranging from Blacksmithing to Charm School.</p>
<p><a id="Foot3"></a>3. Harriet’s frame did not show any sagging due to annealing. The tubes on her frame were shorter than those on Marc’s bicycle and had slightly thicker walls.</p>
<p><a id="Foot4"></a>4. He did not ride this with the original 72" gear. He rode Mt Washington in 1975 alone as the race organizers wouldn't allow him in the race with a  fixed gear bike. He rode a 1:1 gear - 20T rear and made the front chaining from a Sturmey Archer 3 speed cog (so about a 27” gear). The next year he rode the bicycle in the race, having installed a single speed freewheel with an 18T (so about a 30” gear).</p>
