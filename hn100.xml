</figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The numbers shown above are the results of running an optimisation algorithm. Its aim is to find <strong>optimal power flow</strong>.

However, the amount of power that each power plant actually produces depends on the price they offer. This price varies wildly from hour to hour, and neither the price nor the power amount is publicly available.</p><p>Instead, <code>pypsa-eur</code> makes assumptions on prices for solar, wind, coal, nuclear, etc. based on historical averages, and then runs an optimisation algorithm to cover all consumption for the least cost of production.

Liberal Richard Colbeck abstained.</p><p>It followed an hour of spirited debate that saw crossbenchers question and heckle the major parties over what they said was a rushed and flawed law.</p><p>Liberal MP Bridget Archer also broke with her party earlier in the week to vote with the Greens and a handful of independents against the bill in the House of Representatives on Wednesday.</p><p>The major parties had moved quickly to pass the legislation before the end of the parliamentary year, despite reservations from some Coalition MPs, the Greens and independents who called for more time and greater scrutiny.</p><figure data-print="inline-media" data-component="Figure" id="104648542" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/104648542"><div><p><img alt="Anthony Albanese uses his phone on the floor of the House of Represenatives." sizes="100vw" src="https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/7a85d273cac7acd0a7d19cff024ff8a3?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=3333&amp;cropW=5000&amp;xPos=0&amp;yPos=319&amp;width=862&amp;height=575" loading="lazy" data-component="Image" data-lazy="true"></p></div><figcaption><p data-component="Typography">Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in parliament this week.&nbsp;<!-- --> <cite>(<span>ABC News: Luke Stephenson</span>)</cite></p></figcaption></figure><p>Tech companies also agitated for the debate to be delayed until the government's age-verification trial is finalised.</p><p>Under the laws, which won't come into force for another 12 months, social media companies could be fined up to $50 million for failing to take "reasonable steps" to keep under 16s off their platforms.</p><p>There are no penalties for young people or parents who flout the rules.</p><p>Social media companies also won't be able to force users to provide government identification, including the Digital ID, to assess their age.</p><p>"Messaging apps," "online gaming services" and "services with the primary purpose of supporting the health and education of end-users" will not fall under the ban, as well as sites like YouTube that do not require users to log in to access the platform.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">Mixed views from mental health experts</h2><p>The bill was introduced to parliament last Thursday and was referred for a Senate inquiry the same day. Submissions to the inquiry closed on Friday, a three-hour hearing was held on Monday, and the report was tabled on Tuesday.</p><p>Almost all the submissions raised concerns about the "extremely short" consultation period, the committee report noted.</p><p>"Legislation is a necessary tool, but it is not a panacea," Labor senator Karen Grogan wrote.</p><p>"Young people, and in particular diverse cohorts, must be at the centre of the conversation as an age restriction is implemented to ensure there are constructive pathways for connection."</p><p>During the public hearing, witnesses with experience working with young people on their mental health offered a mix of views on the ban.</p><p>Danielle Einstein, a clinical psychologist who has supported the campaign to raise the age at which kids can access social media, said social media offered no mental health benefits for young people as far as she could see.</p><p>But Nicole Palfrey from mental health organisation Headspace was more circumspect, telling the inquiry there was a need to balance any harms from social media with the benefits of connection and "help-seeking" online ‚Äî especially for kids who live in remote or rural areas.</p><p>"When we hear from psychologists and parents they are very much confronted with [the] pointy end, they only see the harms and I think that's incredibly valid," Lucy Thomas from anti-bullying organisation Project Rockit said.</p><p>"But as people working with young people every day, we also see the benefits.</p><p>"We need to tread very carefully or we risk dialling back young peoples' rights and pushing them into more isolated, less supported places."</p></div></div>]]></description>

But the company, who is fairly popular, built out their own CDN via putting a bunch of nginx caching proxies on various Hetzner servers around the world.  It apparently was really cheap and very effective.  Given that they were bootstrapped and this was prior to Cloudflare really being that popular, it was a great strategy.  This was true like 8 years ago, so maybe it has changed in the meantime.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>I think culprits is a poor choice of words since it means someone suspected of a misdeed. I could perhaps understand using it for example for someone that tried to store a petrabyte of storage on a consumer unlimited storage plan. But in this case Hetzner set a specific data usage amount you are paying for so using that amount is not a misdeed.</p>

It was <a href="https://artstation.com/" rel="nofollow">https://artstation.com</a>.  Basically heavily oriented towards serving static images, so the CDN could have been really expensive.  Doing a reverse IP lookup on cdn.artstation.com servers now resolves to Cloudflare and it has cloudflare headers on the response.</p>

									<p><span itemprop="articleBody"><p>When the witty and wry English fantasy novelist Terry Pratchett interviewed Bill Gates for <em>GQ </em>in 1995, only 39% of Americans had access to a home computer. According to the Pew Research Center, the number who were connected to the internet was a paltry 14%. At the dawn of the internet age, when optimistic bromides about the information superhighway to the 21st century were replete in politics and culture, the author of the ‚ÄúDiscworld‚Äù series was less sanguine.</p><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p>
<p>While talking to the CEO of Microsoft, Pratchett asked what would happen if a writer disseminated on the internet something atrocious and libelous, say a pseudo-academic work of Holocaust denial. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a kind of parity of esteem of information on the net,‚Äù said Pratchett, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no way of finding out whether this stuff has any bottom to it or whether someone has just made it up.‚Äù Predictably, Gates denied the threat of any sort of epistemological collapse. Without offering any mechanism for doing so, the billionaire told the author that ‚Äúyou will have authorities on the net‚Ä¶ The whole way that you can check somebody‚Äôs reputation will be so much more sophisticated.‚Äù Google was three years into the future‚ÄîFacebook would be founded in nine years‚ÄîTwitter in eleven. If Pratchett seemed sardonic and cynical in 1995, then Gates‚Äô pollyannish, Panglossian exuberance appears positively psychotic three decades later.</p>
<span>What‚Äôs been sacrificed is not reading in the most prosaic sense, but the particular experience of a certain type of reading.</span>
<p>Pratchett‚Äôs warning may have been lonely during that distant age of unbridled tech-enthusiasm, but he wasn‚Äôt the only Cassandra warning about reality through a smartphone screen darkly. Astrophysicist Carl Sagan predicted in his 1995 <em>The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark</em>&nbsp;that ‚Äúwhen awesome technological powers are in the hands of the very few‚Ä¶ [and] when the people have lost their ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority‚Äù the nation would ‚Äúslide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.‚Äù</p>
<p>For many readers in the previous century‚Äôs last decade, after the vanquishing of Soviet communism and the seemingly never-ending ascendancy of the American experiment, the arc of the moral universe had turned in part because of the supposedly liberatory power of technology. What Pratchett and Sagan prophesized, however, was a coming tumultuousness, not an end of history but rather the demise of truth. Less of a computer revolution than a computer apocalypse.</p>
<p>Before Pratchett or Sagan‚Äîbefore social media and the smart phone, bot farms and artificial intelligence‚Äîthere was Sven Birkerts‚Äôs damning <em>The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of Reading in an Electronic Age. </em>Released thirty years ago on December 1, Birkerts challenged the coming digital transformation when it was still a gleam in the eye of men like Gates (and long before Zuckerberg or Musk). As a manifesto, <em>The Gutenberg Elegies </em>was in opposition to the prevailing utopianism of the ‚Äò90s, seeing in the denigration of physical books an irreparable harm.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p></div>
<p>In the author‚Äôs estimation, the ceding of material books to the ephemeral gauze of the online posed a threat to our attention, to the ability of immersing ourselves within complex narrative or engaging in the almost-transcendent flow of reading. ‚ÄúEverything in contemporary society discourages interiority,‚Äù writes Birkerts. ‚ÄúMore and more of our exchanges take place via circuits, and in their very nature those interactions are such as to keep us hovering in the virtual now, a place away from ourselves.‚Äù If true in 1994, how much more accurate today? As an antidote to the virtual obliteration of the self, Birkerts returns to literature, arguing that in the ‚Äúslow and meditative possession of a book,‚Äù what he calls ‚Äúdeep reading,‚Äù we are able to ‚Äúkeep alive the dangerous and exhilarating idea that life is not sequence of lived moments, but a destiny.‚Äù</p>
<p>Many critics disparaged Birkerts as a fussy Luddite. The anonymous reviewer at Kirkus denounced Birkerts as an ‚Äúinveterate bookworm,‚Äù a ‚Äúcurmudgeon‚Äù who offered a ‚Äúsimplistic and unconvincing jeremiad.‚Äù Wen Stephenson at the <em>Chicago Review </em>claimed that the medium is not the message, describing how he experienced no difference in parsing Seamus Heaney on the page as opposed to the screen, asking ‚Äúdoes it matter that it is transmitted to me, voice and word, through a computer? ‚Ä¶the question is beginning to bore me by now.‚Äù Dean Blobaum of the University of Chicago Press castigated how <em>The Gutenberg Elegies </em>makes electronic media the ‚Äúwhipping boy for the ills of western society,‚Äù claiming that Birkerts‚Äô argument is too all-encompassing, blaming computers for the ‚ÄúDecline in education, literacy, and literate culture.‚Äù Here‚Äôs the thing some thirty years later, however‚ÄîBirkerts was right.</p>
<p>Central to the negative reviews was a misunderstanding of just how different information hashed through the internet would be when compared with the physical codex, that venerable two-millennia old technology. The Kirkus reviewer, for example, imagines a straw-Birkets at various hinge moments in the past, who inveighs against the ‚Äúballpoint, the typewriter, the printing press.‚Äù What this critique misses are that those were technologies of production, but the internet is also a technology of reception. The frenetic, interconnected, hypertext-permeated universe of digital reading is categorically a different experience. Even more importantly, a physical book on a shelf is a cosmos unto-itself, while that dimension of interiority and introspection‚Äîof privacy‚Äîis obscured in the virtual domain.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf anything has changed about my reading over the years, it is that I value the state a book puts me in more than I value the specific contents,‚Äù argued Birkerts, and perhaps that seemed precious three decades ago, but it strikes me as invaluable today. After all, <em>reading </em>itself remains literally central to our existence, maybe more so now than at anytime in history. Our digital lives are mediated through words, whether the tumult of Twitter or the doom-scrolling of Reddit, the ever-present ping of texts and the flux of Facebook. Yet this is an estimably different experience than the immersion in <em>Wuthering Heights </em>or <em>Moby-Dick, Mrs. Dalloway </em>and <em>Ulysses. </em>What‚Äôs been sacrificed is not reading in the most prosaic sense, but the particular experience of a certain type of reading, perilously endangered among all of us attracted to the alluring siren-call of the smartphone ping.</p>
<p>Readerly ‚Äúflow‚Äù allows for a submersion in another way of being, an expansion of possibilities and consciousness. It would be foolish to make that hackneyed, didactic argument that great literature produces good people‚Äîtoo many Nazis read Goethe and Schiller, after all‚Äîbut to abandon deep reading is to jettison something intrinsic, precious, and singular. ‚ÄúI read novels to indulge in a concentrated and directed inner activity that parallels‚Äîand thereby tunes up, accentuates‚Äîmy own inner life,‚Äù writes Birkerts. As much drawn to the digital void as is anybody else alive right now, I‚Äôve had to focus my attention on reading, to prepare myself for dwelling amidst these strange places called novels, and that conscious dedication of time has made immeasurable difference.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p></div>
<p>Without that dedication‚Äîwhich is simply exercised desire‚ÄîI‚Äôd have not recently ambled through the centuries-old haunted house that is the main character in Daniel Mason‚Äôs <em>North Woods </em>nor would I have been dizzied to be in the unreliable consciousness of the spy Sadie Smith in Rachel Kushner‚Äôs <em>Creation Lake, </em>travelled across the immeasurable expanse of Eurasia in the years after the Great War with Pinto in Aleksander Hemon‚Äôs <em>The World and All that it Holds, </em>or become familiar with the dozens of very human characters in Andrew O‚ÄôHagan‚Äôs <em>Caledonian Road, </em>from beleaguered Gen-X art history professors to human trafficked Polish immigrants, British Lords to East London hip-hop artists, a universe in its entirety, contained between two covers of stiff cardboard and eternalized on 624 pages. Books are capable of altering Birkerts‚Äô vaunted interiority, of bending the space-time continuum. As Katya Apekina writes in <em>Mother Doll, </em>another universe I visited this year, ‚ÄúTime does not exist‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs interminable.‚Äù</p>
<span>A printed book is a living animal with flesh of paper and ink of blood, so that compared to turning pages, mere scrolling is anemic.</span>
<p>Birkerts isn‚Äôt necessarily a print mystic, but I am. Mine is an estimably materialist variety of mysticism though, for meaning is the ghost within the machine of the book. Appropriate that Gutenberg, that German gold-miner by training, was inspired to create the matrix of movable print after seeing a similar mechanism used to press grapes into wine, both contraptions intended to distill spirits of-a-sort. The ephemerality of the internet is attractive to entropy, for how much of what‚Äôs been written over the past few decades has all but vanished, our prodigious output a daily burning of the Library of Alexandria, while stone, papyrus, vellum, and paper can endure for centuries. A printed book is a living animal with flesh of paper and ink of blood, so that compared to turning pages, mere scrolling is anemic.</p>
<p>The internet is, regardless of the encomiums of its most fervent supporters, also a physical realm. Despite being composed of silicon and copper, soldering and circuit boards, the internet is still described as an ethereal, disembodied, spiritual realm. This fallacy has been present for nearly a third-of-a-century and embraced with disturbing zealousness by Silicon Valley‚Äôs most cracked digital occultists. But mere affectation doesn‚Äôt draw me to the book, but that it‚Äôs superior at what it does. The codex on which the architecture of the book is still defined remains an essential technology.</p>
<p>Irene Vallelejo in <em>Papyrus: The Invention of Books in the Ancient World </em>quips that the codex is the rare device that a time traveling classical Roman would recognize, the book included alongside shovels and axes in basically appearing the same over the centuries. What makes the book perfect, and thus not in need of change, isn‚Äôt its appearance (they can be both beautiful and ugly), their price (they‚Äôre both expensive and cheap), or their sturdiness (some last forever, others not so much), but rather their ability to <em>disconnect. </em>That is the source of the interiority that Birkerts describes, that books are not mired in the cacophony of the internet.</p>
<p>Among the most poignant scenes in contemporary literature, ever pertinent today, is Winston Smith in George Orwell‚Äôs <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four </em>cradling his paper diary out of view of the panopticon of his telescreen and privately writing down his opinions. Except the telescreen isn‚Äôt all-seeing, it‚Äôs downright primitive compared to contemporary surveillance capitalism, where Big Brother doesn‚Äôt eavesdrop but Alexa does. By contrast, printed books are a zone of resistance against the neon god of the algorithm since tinkering with code can‚Äôt delete their contents, as hackers recently did with the Internet Archive. There is a safety to books, where Smith is able to enter the private realm of literature simply by sitting a bit off camera. That‚Äôs a freedom which, I fear, will become increasingly rare.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p></div>
<p>When we speak of twentieth-century totalitarianism we often due so with a sense of naivety, as if the worst of the past was safely ensconced there, mistaking technological progress with liberty. Now, consider what the Nazis were able to do with flimsy IBM punch cards, and the difference today, the sheer amount of data concerning all of us, saved on servers owned by the very people now enabling authoritarianism. ‚ÄúIf literature is to survive,‚Äù wrote Birkerts, ‚Äúit must become dangerous‚Äù‚Äîit increasingly is. More importantly, if we‚Äôre to survive, then we must become literate, again.</p>

<p><strong>Collective Intelligence for AI and Human Consensus</strong></p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Conversational Game Theory</strong> is a formal game of messaging, replies and tagging between human or AI agents that addresses qualitative, reasoning-intensive challenges while synthesizing multiple perspectives through high stakes conflict resolution and consensus building through narrative structures and feedback loops.</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="960" height="540" src="https://aikiwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Feed-Forward-Flow-Chart-14.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://aikiwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Feed-Forward-Flow-Chart-14.jpg 960w, https://aikiwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Feed-Forward-Flow-Chart-14-300x169.jpg 300w, https://aikiwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Feed-Forward-Flow-Chart-14-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></figure>



<p>This functions as a <a href="https://aikiwiki.com/conversational-game-theory-cgt-a-meta-system-of-collaborative-intelligence/" data-type="page" data-id="630">collective intelligence messaging and composition system</a> designed to handle subjective truths, conflict, collaboration, and complex human-AI interactions in consensus building that is interoperable with any system through an API layer.</p>



<p>As a complete system, Conversational Game Theory identifies a dynamic equilibrium between computational, cognitive and psychological states.</p>



<p>While traditional game theory focuses on strategies between rational agents‚ÄìConversational Game Theory is designed for rational and irrational participants or perspectives.</p>



<p>It utilizes a computer interface and a computational system to publish articles from conversations between agents and humans that we‚Äôve recently piloted to success on parley.aikiwiki.com</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="960" height="540" src="https://aikiwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Feed-Forward-Flow-Chart-12.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://aikiwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Feed-Forward-Flow-Chart-12.jpg 960w, https://aikiwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Feed-Forward-Flow-Chart-12-300x169.jpg 300w, https://aikiwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Feed-Forward-Flow-Chart-12-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></figure>







<p>We propose <strong>AI for Global Conflict Resolution</strong> as a public good that functions as an enhancement layer for LLMs, social media or governance platforms.</p>



<h2>Global Conflict Resolution and Consensus Library (Systems 1)</h2>



<p>Our ability to train AI Agents to play <strong>Conversational Game Theory</strong> from all possible perspectives means we can take any conflict in the world, train AI on all possible perspectives in the conflict, and publish transparent consensus resolutions to those conflicts. The system is immutable to subversion from bad faith actors. </p>



<p><a href="https://aikiwiki.com/conversational-game-theory-cgt-a-collaborative-consensus-building-game/">Humans can join in at anytime.</a></p>



<h2>AI Agent training protocol (Systems 2)</h2>



<p>This Global Library of Consensus Articles acts as <a href="https://aikiwiki.com/contextual-completeness-benchmark-testing-for-llms/">an enhancement layer for chain of thought reasoning for LLMs</a>, as well as a Systems 2 playground to train <a href="https://aikiwiki.com/intelligence-agents-for-a-collaborative-digital-future/" data-type="page" data-id="655">AI agents to play Conversational Game Theory.</a></p>



<h3>Perfect conversations are made possible through <strong>Conversational Game Theory.</strong></h3>



<p>Conversational Game Theory (CGT) engages conflict, debate, disagreement, contradiction, and questioning to <a href="https://aikiwiki.com/conversational-game-theory-cgt-a-collaborative-consensus-building-game/" data-type="link" data-id="https://aikiwiki.com/conversational-game-theory-cgt-a-collaborative-consensus-building-game/">evolve consensus to its best possible state.</a> </p>



<p>CGT makes both humans and AI <em>smarter.</em></p>



<p><strong>CGT achieves large transparent consensus <em>without</em> voting algorithms, enhancing dialogue <em>without </em>censoring any perspective.</strong></p>



<p>Conversely, <em>bad conversations yield bad results</em>.  <em>Bad conversations can make both humans and AI dumber</em>.</p>



<p><strong>While there‚Äôs fear that AI and Large Language Models might harm society, perhaps that damage has already occurred due to web 2.0.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>However, AI and LLMs can solve this problem that web2.0 created and make the web great again using <strong>Conversational Game Theory.</strong></p>



<p>We‚Äôve<a href="https://aikiwiki.com/how-to-parley-aiki-wiki/"> demonstrated</a> that LLMs and AI agents can be trained to play <strong>Conversational Game Theory</strong> from all perspectives, embrace contradictions, explore misunderstandings, and produce superior benchmark scores, i.e. <em>CGT makes AI smarter!</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
	It was a scene ripped from a John le Carr√© novel.</p>



<p>
	According to firsthand accounts and court documents, a man is told to go to the front desk of the Four Seasons Hotel in downtown Manhattan and say the phrase ‚Äúbanana peel.‚Äù The concierge then hands him an envelope with orders to circle the block twice before receiving further instructions. He returns, is shuffled into a secret elevator ‚Äî one that isn‚Äôt even used for celebrities, only visiting dignitaries deemed assassination risks ‚Äî and brought to the penthouse suite.</p>



<p>
	After 15 minutes, Sun Lijun enters the room and lights a cigarette. The man recognizes Sun, not merely because he is the third-highest-ranking official in China. In fact, they had met during a trip the man took to Hong Kong in which Chinese Communist Party officials confiscated his passport, blindfolded him and drove him into mainland China. Sun doesn‚Äôt greet the man sitting on a plush couch at the Four Seasons. Instead, the CCP bigwig pulls out an email from Attorney General Jeff Sessions regarding three American hostages being held in China. One is a pregnant woman. Sun asks the man what should be done about the woman. He suggests that in an act of good faith, she should be released. Sun makes a call, and after a few minutes, shows the man an itinerary ‚Äî proof that the woman will be freed and flown back to the United States. A week later, at the tail end of 2018, the feds close in on the man as he walks into Lure, his favorite SoHo haunt.

	</p>






<p>
	But here‚Äôs the part that le Carr√©‚Äôs editors would have rejected as wildly implausible. The man is <a href="https://variety.com/t/pras-michel/" id="auto-tag_pras-michel" data-tag="pras-michel">Pras Mich√©l</a>, founder of the legendary hip-hop band the <a href="https://variety.com/t/fugees/" id="auto-tag_fugees" data-tag="fugees">Fugees</a>. And his life is about to descend into chaos as he becomes the highest profile target in a labyrinthine criminal corruption case stemming from one of the world‚Äôs biggest financial scandals ‚Äî the $4.5 billion looting of Malaysia‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund known as 1MDB.

	</div>




<p>
	‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if subconsciously it was a bit exciting for me too,‚Äù Mich√©l recalls in his first interview since being convicted in that case. ‚ÄúI like spy movies, but I never wanted to be a spy. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs sexy. But a part of it felt like that.‚Äù</p>



<p>
	If there was one red flag that something was off that night, Mich√©l says it was the elevator. As a celebrity who has performed before crowds of 100,000, Mich√©l was familiar with being whisked in and out of hotels by security. This was ‚Ä¶ different.

	‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to tell you what was weird to me: the fact that the Four Seasons has a private elevator. I never knew that. They have a private elevator for just certain people,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut my life leading up to that point felt surreal, so part of that night felt natural.‚Äù</p>



<p>
	Last April, a jury convicted Mich√©l on 10 counts, including violating campaign finance laws during Barack Obama‚Äôs 2012 reelection bid and illegally lobbying the Donald Trump administration in 2017. The circus-like D.C. trial lasted three weeks and featured Leonardo DiCaprio testifying for the prosecution and everyone from Kim Kardashian to Martin Scorsese name-checked during testimony.</p>



<p>
	‚ÄúMich√©l played a central role in a wide-ranging conspiracy to improperly influence top government officials, including the then-president [Trump] and the then-attorney general [Sessions],‚Äù said Department of Justice special agent in charge Harry Lidsky. Likewise, Luis Quesada, assistant director of the FBI‚Äôs Criminal Investigative Division, claimed that Mich√©l ‚Äúbrazenly conspired to help a foreign national launder millions of dollars in illegitimate campaign contributions into the 2012 U.S. presidential election.‚Äù</p>



<p>
	In short, the government dubbed Mich√©l a Chinese spy, and a jury agreed. He now faces 22 years in federal prison.</p>



<p>
	‚ÄúTechnically, I‚Äôm a foreign agent,‚Äù he says.</p>



<p>
	How a Yale-educated musical prodigy who made up one-third of a Grammy-winning group got caught up in this mess makes it one of the most riveting celebrity sagas in years. At the center of the tale is Jho Low, the wild-spending financier who burst onto the scene in 2013 by backing ‚ÄúThe Wolf of Wall Street,‚Äù Scorsese and DiCaprio‚Äôs $100 million look at financial fraud and bacchanalian excess. As Low‚Äôs influence in Hollywood grew, scores of celebrities partied on his private jet, drank his Cristal and accepted his lavish gifts (DiCaprio landed a $3.2 million Picasso and a $9 million Basquiat), at least until his elaborate embezzlement scheme unraveled and he became a fugitive. For his part, Mich√©l entered Low‚Äôs circle after the two were connected in 2006 via a party promoter who caters to the rich and shameless.</p>



<p>
	Low‚Äôs world extended beyond Hollywood to include political operatives ‚Äî like Democrat Frank White Jr., a relation of Michelle Obama by marriage, and Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy ‚Äî who did his bidding. White has never been charged, while Trump later pardoned Broidy. Mich√©l says he and Low were never friends, but he connected the deep-pocketed newcomer to other VIPs. He remains the only one in Low‚Äôs orbit to face real consequences.</p>



<p>
	‚ÄúThe government needed a prize. They needed a head, and he was the low-hanging fruit,‚Äù says Robert Meloni, a litigator on Mich√©l‚Äôs team.</p>



<p>
	On an overcast September day in New York, Mich√©l, now 52, takes me down the rabbit hole. We meet in his sparsely furnished 4,500-square-foot SoHo apartment with floor-to-ceiling views of lower Manhattan ‚Äî a maroon couch, a baby grand piano and a shelf showcasing his Grammys are the only signs of occupancy. The walls are completely bare save for a giant TV. You might assume the government confiscated Mich√©l‚Äôs furnishings. But you‚Äôd be wrong.

	</p>




<p>
	‚ÄúI‚Äôm a minimalist,‚Äù he explains.</p>



<p>
	Wearing a gray Dolce &amp; Gabbana T-shirt with ‚ÄúLove Is King‚Äù emblazoned on the front, jeans, pink socks and sandals, Mich√©l exudes a post-yoga-class calm despite a looming sentencing date in January.</p>



<p>
	‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to fight, and I‚Äôm going to appeal, but there‚Äôs a possibility that I‚Äôm going <em>in</em> while I‚Äôm fighting,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just the reality.‚Äù</p>



<p>
	Mich√©l was charged under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a once rare maneuver. From 1967 to 2018, the feds only brought forward 12 criminal cases under FARA. But there has been a newfound zeal over the past six years, particularly against members of the Trump administration. Mich√©l says the feds even threatened to use the Logan Act against him. Only two people have ever been indicted under the Logan Act. Adding to his woes, the government seized roughly $80 million from him. In the initial indictment, officials accused him and Low of illegally trying to ‚Äúobtain foreign access to, and influence with, high-ranking United States government officials for financial benefit.‚Äù</p>



<p>
	‚ÄúEvery aspect of my life has been disrupted. I can‚Äôt bank anywhere, been kicked out of 13 banks,‚Äù Mich√©l says.</p>



<p>
	Still, there are hints of wealth on display. A vintage Patek Philippe watch adorns one of Mich√©l‚Äôs wrists, and Cartier and Tiffany bracelets hang on the other. Mich√©l insists that he was never motivated by money. Instead, after the Fugees disbanded in 1997, he continued to land Grammy nominations as the artist behind the seminal ‚ÄúGhetto Supastar (That Is What You Are),‚Äù but he also became a documentarian who traveled to dangerous locations to make gonzo films like ‚ÄúSkid Row‚Äù (embedding in L.A.‚Äôs homeless community) and ‚ÄúSweet Micky for President‚Äù (which chronicled Michel Martelly‚Äôs bid for Haiti‚Äôs presidency amid civil unrest unleashed by the 2010 earthquake). He got comfortable being uncomfortable.</p>



<p>
	‚ÄúI love being able to go stay at the penthouse in the Ritz-Carlton and then being in some fucking locked-up dungeon in Somalia eating rice with my hands,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhen I was kidnapped [there], they were about to sell me to Al-Shabaab, the terrorist group. We were trying to do a documentary. I remember my director was freaking out. He was going crazy. He‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòYo, you have a death wish on you, Pras. I should have never listened to you.‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòWell, look at it like this. You shot some stuff. Maybe the footage would get back to the States. If we die, at least we got to tell a great story.‚Äô He‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòWhat the fuck? What you mean a great story?‚Äô And obviously State Department came and got us out.‚Äù</p>

<p>
	Perhaps that‚Äôs why he was unfazed by Low‚Äôs cartoonish grandiosity and the strange asks he began to make. Low threw money around like a sultan, hosting Vegas birthday bashes and Cannes blowouts. But in 2012, as the feds closed in, Low struggled to keep his fraud operation from being exposed. The Malaysian financier tried to leverage his White House ties. He turned to Mich√©l, an Obama fundraiser, and offered him $20 million for a photograph with the president. Mich√©l obliged and kept most of the money. His thinking was rich people will spare no expense to meet famous people.

	</p>




<p>
	‚ÄúI know people like [Low] who legitimately have money, and they‚Äôre wild,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúIf they want something, they‚Äôre going to go through all means to get it because they have the resources to. People say, ‚ÄòPeople do crazy things,‚Äô but they haven‚Äôt actually witnessed it. I‚Äôve witnessed it.‚Äù</p>



<p>
	Case in point, the billionaire who lives on the top floor of his SoHo building.</p>



<p>
	‚ÄúThis guy wanted a statue. They literally shut down this whole block for a whole day, had to bring a crane, had to literally do a hole in the roof to bring the statue he wanted in, and then they redid the roof. He paid for it, obviously. But the roof is not his. It‚Äôs for the building. But he‚Äôs a billionaire, so it‚Äôs like ‚Ä¶ ,‚Äù he says with a shrug.</p>



<p>
	And Low‚Äôs spending kept him on the government‚Äôs radar. As his house of cards teetered, he tapped his political connections and turned to Mich√©l again. With the turnover from Obama to Trump, Low hoped the new administration would go easy on him and unfreeze his assets. That‚Äôs where the Chinese government fit in. During the Hong Kong trip Mich√©l took with Low, the CCP conveyed that it wanted the United States to extradite a fugitive named Guo Wengui. In exchange, it would release three U.S. prisoners, including the pregnant woman. The scheme faced obstacles, namely that Guo happened to be a Steve Bannon pal and a member at Donald Trump‚Äôs club, Mar-a-Lago.</p>



<p>
	By the time of the Four Seasons meeting, which Low orchestrated, Mich√©l was already in the feds‚Äô crosshairs. When the FBI began asking him questions, the rapper never requested a lawyer, believing that his actions were legal. After all, he was being advised by George Higginbotham, a senior congressional affairs specialist at the Department of Justice.</p>



<p>
	‚ÄúThe one person that I relied on, especially legally, didn‚Äôt give me the best advice,‚Äù Mich√©l says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs his job. I‚Äôm an artist. There‚Äôs a reason why you rely on your legal counsel. They‚Äôre the one that‚Äôs going to sit here and tell you, ‚ÄòNah. OK, if you want to do this, do it this way so you don‚Äôt have any exposure.‚Äô So if my representative is sanctioning what I‚Äôm doing and my representative coincidentally works for the DOJ, I am not going to sit here and think I‚Äôm wrong, right?‚Äù (Higginbotham did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>



<p>
	The prosecution claimed that Mich√©l netted more than $100 million from his association with Low. When I ask if that figure is accurate, he declines to comment. In 2020, a year after Mich√©l was charged, the feds offered him a plea deal. But he turned it down, maintaining that he did nothing wrong. Still, the Trump administration‚Äôs DOJ never moved forward with the case. Despite his Obama ties, the Biden administration did.</p>



<p>
	‚ÄúAll the real players escaped,‚Äù says a high-profile attorney who followed the case. ‚ÄúPras was the little guy who took the fall.‚Äù</p>



<p>
	For his part, Higginbotham pleaded guilty to conspiracy to deceive U.S. banks about millions of dollars in foreign lobbying funds and was sentenced to three months‚Äô probation. He testified against Mich√©l. As for some of the other characters in the sprawling narrative, Guo was convicted in the U.S. of defrauding investors and supporters of $1 billion.

	</p>




<p>
	‚ÄúWhen the feds went into his $30 million apartment on Park Avenue, the apartment was remotely blown up. Did you know that?‚Äù Mich√©l says, awestruck. ‚ÄúI guess all the evidence was in the apartment. Whatever. Allegedly, it wasn‚Äôt him [who detonated the bomb], but somebody blew the apartment up remotely while the feds were coming in.‚Äù (The FBI and the New York Fire Department reportedly were investigating a mysterious 2023 fire that broke out as authorities entered the luxury abode.)</p>



<p>
	Meanwhile, a court in China sentenced Sun to death in 2022 for taking bribes, with the chance that the sentence be reduced to life in prison without parole. Low escaped the United States and is believed to be living in China.</p>



<p>
	‚ÄúHe has as much freedom as someone in a phone booth,‚Äù Mich√©l says of the man who turned his life upside down. ‚ÄúWithout getting too philosophical about it, it was about me being at the right place at the wrong time. Or the wrong place at the right time.‚Äù</p>



<p>
	By the time Mich√©l‚Äôs trial began, it appeared as though he had hired the wrong attorney in David Kenner, best known for representing Suge Knight in his 2015 murder case. He had little experience with white-collar crime. He allowed Mich√©l to testify, an unorthodox move that rarely helps a defendant. In an absurd twist, Kenner reportedly used an AI-generated closing argument. ‚ÄúThe court has adjudicated those three issues, and they have been denied,‚Äù Kenner says. (Earlier this year, Kenner pleaded guilty to misdemeanor criminal contempt and was sentenced to one year of probation over his handling of discovery materials in Mich√©l‚Äôs case.)</p>



<p>
	Mich√©l is now represented by Peter Zeidenberg. ‚ÄúWe continue to believe that Mr. Mich√©l was not afforded a fair trial, and that the jury‚Äôs verdict should be overturned,‚Äù Zeidenberg says. ‚ÄúWe plan to appeal this verdict and believe that Mr. Mich√©l will, ultimately, be fully exonerated.‚Äù</p>



<p>
	The story seems ripe for the Hollywood treatment, and at least three books on the subject are already in the works. Idris Elba has also approached Mich√©l‚Äôs camp about acquiring his life rights, and there will be a documentary centering on Mich√©l‚Äôs Zelig-like involvement in the surreal story. Director Ben Patterson unveiled footage of the project during a secret screening at the Toronto Film Festival in September. The audience sat in stunned silence, he says. Some of it was shot by Mich√©l, who was brave (or crazy) enough to keep his camera on during the meeting with Sun in China.</p>



<p>
	‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so many people that were connected to this,‚Äù Patterson says. ‚ÄúIt just is surprising and appalling that Pras is the one that gets singled out to the extent that he has. But in doing so, he exposed a lot about how government, celebrity and global finance are all intertwined.‚Äù</p>



<p>
	As Mich√©l sits inside the place that he will call home for at least a few more months, he reflects on the people who abandoned him. No publicist would touch him or his case, fearing that they, too, would become entangled in a criminal investigation. Erica Dumas, a crisis publicist with D.C. ties who once worked for Sen. John Kerry, was the only one who would agree to work with him. Friends also began to keep their distance.

	</p>




<p>
	In 2020, right before the pandemic hit, two federal agents visit the L.A. home of one of his closest buddies, who is married with three daughters.</p>



<p>
	‚ÄúLook, you get a call, FBI show up to your place, I don‚Äôt care who you are, your heart is going up your throat,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòHey, we just got a couple of questions for you. So can we come in?‚Äô Who‚Äôs going to say no? So he let them in. The wife comes, sits in the living room, don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, but she‚Äôs scared. And at some point, one of the agents goes, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs that? Do you smell that?‚Äô The wife defecated on herself. She was that scared. And the wife later told my friend, ‚ÄòIf you ever speak to Pras again, I‚Äôll take my three daughters and you‚Äôll never see us again.‚Äô‚Äù</p>

<p>
	And though he doesn‚Äôt say their names, it‚Äôs apparent that his former Fugees bandmates Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean are among those who ghosted him.</p>



<p>
	‚ÄúI‚Äôm done with that. They‚Äôre going to Europe [to tour]. I can‚Äôt go, so,‚Äù he says of the conditions of his bail that prevent him from leaving the country. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what it is. You can‚Äôt give people that kind of energy. So you could be frustrated, you could be disappointed, but I really believe in my path and in my journey, and I believe what‚Äôs mine, no one‚Äôs going to be able to take it away from me. So it‚Äôs better that you have a small group of people who really believe in you and believe in what you‚Äôre doing than to have 100 people around you, and the minute something happens ‚Äî boom. People just disappear.‚Äù</p>



<p>
	A few weeks after our meeting, Mich√©l files a blistering lawsuit against Hill, accusing her of fraud and breach of contract over the Fugees‚Äô 2023 reunion tour that ended abruptly this year amid a slew of canceled concerts. It left little doubt about his feelings toward his former colleague. (In the shade-filled complaint, he claimed Hill showed ‚Äúarrogance‚Äù for ‚Äúunilaterally‚Äù rejecting a $5 million offer to play Coachella, alleging her ‚Äúego was bruised‚Äù because No Doubt got top billing over the Fugees. Hill hit back, calling the lawsuit ‚Äúbaseless‚Äù and ‚Äúfull of false claims and unwarranted attacks.‚Äù)</p>



<p>
	Mich√©l makes his way to the baby grand. He‚Äôs thinking about his 6-year-old daughter. For most of our interview, he speaks flatly, seeming both resigned and exhausted. But he grows animated as he begins talking about the girl he calls ‚Äúmy joy.‚Äù She lives part of the year in Italy, making it difficult to see her given that he has to stay in the U.S. But she traveled to Los Angeles with her mother recently, giving him renewed hope. Over the past few days, a song lodged in his head like an earworm. He didn‚Äôt know how to play it, so he taught himself.</p>



<p>
	As the midday sun breaks through the clouds, Mich√©l begins tapping out an unmistakable melody on the piano. It‚Äôs the Jackson 5‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôll Be There.‚Äù

            <pubDate>Thu, 28 Nov 2024 03:58:49 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://proot-me.github.io/">https://proot-me.github.io/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42262308">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div xmlns="" id="description"><h2>Description</h2><p>PRoot is a user-space implementation of <tt>chroot</tt>, <tt>mount --bind</tt>,
and <tt>binfmt_misc</tt>.  This means that users don't need any privileges
or setup to do things like using an arbitrary directory as the new
root filesystem, making files accessible somewhere else in the
filesystem hierarchy, or executing programs built for another CPU
architecture transparently through QEMU user-mode.  Also, developers
can use PRoot as a generic Linux process instrumentation engine thanks
to its extension mechanism, see <a href="https://proot-me.github.io/care">CARE</a> for an example.  Technically
PRoot relies on <tt>ptrace</tt>, an unprivileged system-call available in
every Linux kernel.</p><p>The new root file-system, a.k.a <em>guest rootfs</em>, typically contains a
Linux distribution.  By default PRoot confines the execution of
programs to the guest rootfs only, however users can use the built-in
<em>mount/bind</em> mechanism to access files and directories from the actual
root file-system, a.k.a <em>host rootfs</em>, just as if they were part of
the guest rootfs.</p><p>When the guest Linux distribution is made for a CPU architecture
incompatible with the host one, PRoot uses the CPU emulator QEMU
user-mode to execute transparently guest programs.  It's a convenient
way to develop, to build, and to validate any guest Linux packages
seamlessly on users' computer, just as if they were in a <em>native</em>
guest environment.  That way all of the cross-compilation issues are
avoided.</p><p>PRoot can also <em>mix</em> the execution of host programs and the execution
of guest programs emulated by QEMU user-mode.  This is useful to use
host equivalents of programs that are missing from the guest rootfs
and to speed up build-time by using cross-compilation tools or
CPU-independent programs, like interpreters.</p><p>It is worth noting that the guest kernel is never involved, regardless
of whether QEMU user-mode is used or not.  Technically, when guest
programs perform access to system resources, PRoot translates their
requests before sending them to the host kernel.  This means that
guest programs can use host resources (devices, network, ...) just as
if they were "normal" host programs.</p></div><div xmlns="" id="examples"><h2>Examples</h2><p>In the following examples the directories <tt>/mnt/slackware-8.0</tt> and
<tt>/mnt/armslack-12.2/</tt> contain a Linux distribution respectively made
for x86 CPUs and ARM CPUs.</p><div id="chroot\ equivalent"><h3><tt>chroot</tt> equivalent</h3><p>To execute a command inside a given Linux distribution, just give
<tt>proot</tt> the path to the guest rootfs followed by the desired
command.  The example below executes the program <tt>cat</tt> to print the
content of a file:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/ cat /etc/motd

Welcome to Slackware Linux 8.0</pre><p>The default command is <tt>/bin/sh</tt> when none is specified. Thus the
shortest way to confine an interactive shell and all its sub-programs
is:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/

$ cat /etc/motd
Welcome to Slackware Linux 8.0</pre></div><div id="mount\ --bind\ equivalent"><h3><tt>mount --bind</tt> equivalent</h3><p>The bind mechanism enables one to relocate files and directories.  This is
typically useful to trick programs that perform access to hard-coded
locations, like some installation scripts:</p><pre>proot -b /tmp/alternate_opt:/opt

$ cd to/sources
$ make install
[...]
install -m 755 prog "/opt/bin"
[...] # prog is installed in "/tmp/alternate_opt/bin" actually</pre><p>As shown in this example, it is possible to bind over files not even
owned by the user.  This can be used to <em>overlay</em> system configuration
files, for instance the DNS setting:</p><pre>ls -l /etc/hosts
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 675 Mar  4  2011 /etc/hosts</pre><pre>proot -b ~/alternate_hosts:/etc/hosts

$ echo '1.2.3.4 google.com' &gt; /etc/hosts
$ resolveip google.com
IP address of google.com is 1.2.3.4
$ echo '5.6.7.8 google.com' &gt; /etc/hosts
$ resolveip google.com
IP address of google.com is 5.6.7.8</pre><p>Another example: on most Linux distributions <tt>/bin/sh</tt> is a symbolic
link to <tt>/bin/bash</tt>, whereas it points to <tt>/bin/dash</tt> on Debian
and Ubuntu.  As a consequence a <tt>#!/bin/sh</tt> script tested with Bash
might not work with Dash.  In this case, the binding mechanism of
PRoot can be used to set non-disruptively <tt>/bin/bash</tt> as the default
<tt>/bin/sh</tt> on these two Linux distributions:</p><pre>proot -b /bin/bash:/bin/sh [...]</pre><p>Because <tt>/bin/sh</tt> is initially a symbolic link to <tt>/bin/dash</tt>, the
content of <tt>/bin/bash</tt> is actually bound over this latter:</p><pre>proot -b /bin/bash:/bin/sh

$ md5sum /bin/sh
089ed56cd74e63f461bef0fdfc2d159a  /bin/sh
$ md5sum /bin/bash
089ed56cd74e63f461bef0fdfc2d159a  /bin/bash
$ md5sum /bin/dash
089ed56cd74e63f461bef0fdfc2d159a  /bin/dash</pre><p>In most cases this shouldn't be a problem, but it is still possible to
strictly bind <tt>/bin/bash</tt> over <tt>/bin/sh</tt> -- without dereferencing
it -- by specifying the <tt>!</tt> character at the end:</p><pre>proot -b '/bin/bash:/bin/sh!'

$ md5sum /bin/sh
089ed56cd74e63f461bef0fdfc2d159a  /bin/sh
$ md5sum /bin/bash
089ed56cd74e63f461bef0fdfc2d159a  /bin/bash
$ md5sum /bin/dash
c229085928dc19e8d9bd29fe88268504  /bin/dash</pre></div><div id="chroot\ +\ mount\ --bind\ equivalent"><h3><tt>chroot</tt> + <tt>mount --bind</tt> equivalent</h3><p>The two features above can be combined to make any file from the host
rootfs accessible in the confined environment just as if it were
initially part of the guest rootfs.  It is sometimes required to run
programs that rely on some specific files:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/

$ ps -o tty,command
Error, do this: mount -t proc none /proc</pre><p>works better with:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/ -b /proc

$ ps -o tty,command
TT       COMMAND
?        bash

provides the option <tt>-R</tt> to bind automatically a pre-defined list of
recommended paths:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/slackware-8.0/

$ ps -o tty,command
TT       COMMAND
pts/6    bash
pts/6    proot -R /mnt/slackware-8.0/
pts/6    sh
pts/6    ps -o tty,command</pre></div><div id="chroot\ +\ mount\ --bind\ +\ su\ equivalent"><h3><tt>chroot</tt> + <tt>mount --bind</tt> + <tt>su</tt> equivalent</h3><p>Some programs will not work correctly if they are not run by the
"root" user, this is typically the case with package managers.  PRoot
can fake the root identity and its privileges when the <tt>-0</tt> (zero)
option is specified:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/ -0

# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) [...]

# mkdir /tmp/foo
# chmod a-rwx /tmp/foo
# echo 'I bypass file-system permissions.' &gt; /tmp/foo/bar
# cat /tmp/foo/bar
I bypass file-system permissions.</pre><p>This option is typically required to create or install packages into
the guest rootfs.  Note it is <em>not</em> recommended to use the <tt>-R</tt>
option when installing packages since they may try to update bound
system files, like <tt>/etc/group</tt>.  Instead, it is recommended to use
the <tt>-S</tt> option.  This latter enables the <tt>-0</tt> option and binds
only paths that are known to not be updated by packages:</p><pre>proot -S /mnt/slackware-8.0/

# installpkg perl.tgz
Installing package perl...</pre></div><div id="chroot\ +\ mount\ --bind\ +\ binfmt_misc\ equivalent"><h3><tt>chroot</tt> + <tt>mount --bind</tt> + <tt>binfmt_misc</tt> equivalent</h3><p>PRoot uses QEMU user-mode to execute programs built for a CPU
architecture incompatible with the host one.  From users'
point-of-view, guest programs handled by QEMU user-mode are executed
transparently, that is, just like host programs.  To enable this
feature users just have to specify which instance of QEMU user-mode
they want to use with the option <tt>-q</tt>:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -q qemu-arm

$ cat /etc/motd
Welcome to ARMedSlack Linux 12.2</pre><p>The parameter of the <tt>-q</tt> option is actually a whole QEMU user-mode
command, for instance to enable its GDB server on port 1234:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -q "qemu-arm -g 1234" emacs</pre><p>PRoot allows one to mix transparently the emulated execution of guest
programs and the native execution of host programs in the same
file-system namespace.  It's typically useful to extend the list of
available programs and to speed up build-time significantly.  This
mixed-execution feature is enabled by default when using QEMU
user-mode, and the content of the host rootfs is made accessible
through <tt>/host-rootfs</tt>:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -q qemu-arm

$ file /bin/echo
[...] ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM [...]
$ /bin/echo 'Hello world!'
Hello world!

$ file /host-rootfs/bin/echo
[...] ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64 [...]
$ /host-rootfs/bin/echo 'Hello mixed world!'
Hello mixed world!</pre><p>Since both host and guest programs use the guest rootfs as <tt>/</tt>,
users may want to deactivate explicitly cross-filesystem support found
in most GNU cross-compilation tools.  For example with GCC configured
to cross-compile to the ARM target:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -q qemu-arm

$ export CC=/host-rootfs/opt/cross-tools/arm-linux/bin/gcc
$ export CFLAGS="--sysroot=/"   # could be optional indeed
$ ./configure; make</pre><p>As with regular files, a host instance of a program can be bound over
its guest instance.  Here is an example where the guest binary of
<tt>make</tt> is overlaid by the host one:</p><pre>proot -R /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -q qemu-arm -b /usr/bin/make

$ which make
/usr/bin/make
$ make --version # overlaid
GNU Make 3.82
Built for x86_64-slackware-linux-gnu</pre><p>It's worth mentioning that even when mixing the native execution of
host programs and the emulated execution of guest programs, they still
believe they are running in a native guest environment.  As a
demonstration, here is a partial output of a typical <tt>./configure</tt>
script:</p><pre>checking whether the C compiler is a cross-compiler... no</pre></div></div><div xmlns="" id="downloads"><h2>Downloads</h2><div id=""><h3>PRoot</h3><p>The source code for PRoot and CARE are hosted in the same repository on <a href="https://github.com/proot-me/proot">GitHub</a>.

<p dir="auto">When Windows Defender mistakenly recognizes a batch file as a Trojan, this is often called a 'False Positive'. To solve this problem, you can go through the following steps:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>File exception handling: In Windows Defender, you can set certain files or processes to skip security scanning. To do this, follow the steps below:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Click the ‚ÄòStart‚Äô button and go to ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô.</li>
<li>Click ‚ÄòUpdate &amp; Security‚Äô.</li>
<li>Select ‚ÄòWindows Security‚Äô and go to ‚ÄòVirus &amp; threat protection‚Äô.</li>
<li>Click ‚ÄòManage Virus &amp; Threat Protection Settings‚Äô.</li>
<li>Select 'Add exception' in 'Virus &amp; threat protection settings'.</li>
<li>Select 'File or Folder', find the batch file in question and add it as an exception.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Temporarily disable Windows Defender: This may be a temporary solution. However, you must be careful when using this method as it may expose your computer to other threats.</li>
<li>Report the problem to anti-virus software: If you are sure that the file is not a Trojan horse, you can report it to Microsoft as a False Positive. Microsoft will review this and take any necessary action.</li>

<p>In 1974, Professor Shawn Buckley ran an <a href="http://web.mit.edu/iap/">M.I.T. Independent Activities Period</a>
course where participants, including Marc Rosenbaum and Harriet Fell, got to build their own bicycle frames.  Marc Rosenbaum, then a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, set out to create a bicycle that would give a rider an acceleration advantage by being ultra light without sacrificing stiffness. In this paper, we describe some of Marc‚Äôs design, the frames he and Harriet built in the IAP course, and how these played a role in the Klein vs. Cannondale patent litigation in the mid-1980s.</p>

<h2>Marc Rosenbaum‚Äôs Aluminum Bicycle</h2>
<p>In 1974, Marc Rosenbaum was a senior at M.I.T. majoring in mechanical engineering. The goal of his undergraduate thesis (<a href="http://sheldonbrown.com/MarcRosenbaumThesis.pdf">Rosenbaum 1974</a>) project was to create and describe
a bicycle that would give a rider an acceleration advantage by being ultra light without sacrificing stiffness. Marc stressed stiffness over strength, pointing out that ‚Äúframes never break in normal racing conditions, which indicates that strength is not a problem.‚Äù Clearly things have changed since carbon fiber bicycles have entered the racing scene though the problem is not their resistance to normal loads encountered during rides but to impact damage.</p>

<p>In 1974, normal track bikes weighed 18 or 19 pounds. There are lighter bikes today; the I.C.U. minimum weight limit is 6.8 kg, which is about 15 pounds. There were also some lighter bikes in 1974. A bicycle made for Eddy Merckx in 1971, which he rode to set the one-hour record (30.715 mi), weighed only 13.25 pounds. It had a very light steel frame, custom built titanium handlebars, stem, and seatpost, partially plastic pedals, 24-spoke wheels, and tires expected to last at most 4 hours on a smooth board track. The components were extensively drilled out. This bicycle was not designed for strength or to last (<a href="http://sheldonbrown.com/MarcRosenbaumThesis.pdf">Rosenbaum 1974</a>).</p>

<p>

<strong>The bicycle built by Marc Rosenbaum weighing 12 lbs. 5oz.</strong>
</p>

<h2>Marc‚Äôs Design Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use larger diameter tubular components</strong> - Strength goes up as the cube<sup><a href="#Foot1">1</a></sup> of the diameter so unless there are geometric constraints, use larger diameter tubes with thinner walls to get a lighter structure with increased strength and stiffness.</li>
<li><strong>Use sealed precision bearings</strong> - higher quality and lighter.</li>
<li><strong>Sacrifice adjustability</strong> - adjustment features add weight.</li>
<li><strong>Use alloys</strong> ‚Äì Marc settled on 6061-T6 aluminum where welding was needed and used 2024-T4 aluminum and titanium (Ti 6Al 4V) in other places. He ruled out magnesium, which is best per unit weight in compressive buckling but is brittle and difficult to extrude. He noted that aluminum is easier to weld and fabricate than titanium and more than twice as efficient as steel against compressive buckling. The walls in existing steel tubes were already down to .020‚Äù - .025‚Äù and would be prone to buckling if they were made thinner to compensate for increased diameter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Frame</h2>
<p>The table below shows the tube lengths and thicknesses that Marc used in his frame.
The frame was put into a jig to hold it in alignment and was joined by tungsten-inert-gas welding. After welding, it was heat-treated (annealed) to relieve stresses induced by welding and to bring the aluminum back up to its initial strength. The top tube sagged about 1/32 of an inch during annealing. This was apparently due to the greatly decreased strength of the aluminum at the high temperature of the heat treatment process.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Bracket</h2>
<p>The bottom bracket was bored out to press fit the bearings directly into it. The result is a highly accurate and simple system. A Teledyne titanium axle was modified to accept the precision bearings. The axle saved three ounces and the bearings were 2.5 ounces lighter than the conventional bearing arrangement.</p>

<h2>The Hubs</h2>
<p>The body of the rear hub is of 2024-T4 aluminum. It was bored out for precision sealed bearings and has a hollow titanium axle. It weighs only 5 ounces vs. 11.5 ounces for standard track rear hubs. Similar construction was used for the front hub. It weighed only 3 ounces vs. 9 ounces for a conventional hub.</p>

<h2>The Pedals</h2>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.sheldonbrown.com/images/MarcBike/pedal250.jpg" alt="Marc's pedal" width="250">
  <figcaption>Marc's pedal</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The pedals were designed to be comfortable, easy to get into (with toe clips), and to allow sharp cornering. They have platforms of 2024-T4 aluminum on which the whole ball of the rider‚Äôs foot can rest. The axle is of titanium and is threaded to fit a standard crank. The bearings are pressed into the pedal body and onto the axle. The pair of pedals weighs 7.5 ounces, 5 ounces less than the lightest track pedals of the time.</p>

<h2>The Saddle</h2>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.sheldonbrown.com/images/MarcBike/saddle250.jpg" alt="Marc's saddle" width="250">
  <figcaption>Marc's saddle</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The saddle is a prime example of eliminating unneeded adjustability. Marc determined his saddle-to-pedal distance on another bicycle and decided on an integral seatpost/saddle for the bike. The result is a savings of nearly a pound.</p>

<h2>Handlebars and Stem</h2>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.sheldonbrown.com/images/MarcBike/handlebars250.jpg" alt="Marc's handlebars and stem" width="250">
  <figcaption>Marc's handlebars and stem</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Track bikes have the bars down low to put the rider into an efficient sprint position. Track riders often use only one position. Marc attached the handlebars directly to the fork crown, reducing weight and increasing rigidity. A simple, wide shallow U-shaped handlebar was attached via the handlebar-mounting end of a steel stem silver-soldered to a steel strip that was in turn silver-soldered to the top of the fork crown. This arrangement saved almost a pound.</p>

<h2>Other Components</h2>
<p>The wheels used Hi-E Engineering tubular rims and Pirelli Specialissimo Corsa Leggero tires. The track sprocket, chain, and T.A. cotterless 48 tooth chainring were standard. The bike initially had an 18-tooth rear sprocket for a gear of 72 inches. The headset was Stronglight Competition, and a Raleigh road-racing fork was modified to give the required wheel clearance and the design fork rake of 1.5 inches.</p>

<p>The bicycle that Marc built for his undergraduate thesis project was the world'‚Äô's lightest track bicycle at that time. The finished bicycle was as rigid as a normal sprint track bicycle and with wheels built up for road riding, weighed 12 pounds, 5 ounces. The bicycle is currently at the M.I.T. Museum.

<h2>Harriet Fell's Aluminum Bicycle</h2>
<p>In 1974, Harriet Fell was an Assistant Professor of mathematics at Northeastern University, across the river from M.I.T. The (<a href="http://web.mit.edu/iap/">M.I.T. Independent Activities Period</a>) is a special four-week term at M.I.T. that runs during the month of January.<sup><a href="#Foot2">2</a></sup> In 1974, Professor Shawn Buckley offered an Aluminum Bike Project class. This was an opportunity for students to build their own aluminum bicycle frames. The tubes suggested for the class were of a smaller diameter and had thicker walls than the ones Marc decided to use. Harriet showed up and ordered a set of tubes.</p>

<p>She designed her frame by using some measurements (e.g. top tube, seat tube, and the angle between them) from her favorite bicycle, a Holdsworth Strada. Working with the constraints of the wider tubes and her small size (5' 2") and making sure to leave enough space for 700C wheels, she made an accurate half-size drawing of the planned frame. She then measured the lengths of the other tubes from the drawing. With advice and instruction from Marc, Shawn, and the machine shop staff, she learned to use a metal lathe and milling machine enough to machine the tubes and dropouts for her bicycle. She put the parts into a jig, and Shawn sent it off for welding. Shawn said that the completed frame was particularly light and strong. (The fact that it was made for someone only 5' 2" tall surely had something to do with this. A frame for Eddy Merckx at 6' 1" would surely have weighed more.) Shawn demonstrated the strength of the frame by laying it on its side and standing/bouncing on the seat stays.<sup><a href="#Foot3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Gary Klein also made a frame in this project in the spring of 1974 and got even wider tubes to make a larger frame.</p>

<h2>Harriet‚Äôs Frame Goes to France</h2>
<p>Just after finishing the frame, Harriet moved to France to continue her career in mathematics. She also started cycling with the cyclosport group at the FaculteÃÅ de Science at Orsay. She got as far as mounting a headset and fork on her frame, but math and cycling, including riding the <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/fell/PBP1975.html">1975 Paris-Brest-Paris</a>, filled most of her time. In September 1976, unable to extend her leave of absence for another year, she returned to Northeastern University. As she was determined to move back to France, she left her frame, a large bag of books and clothes, and a pile of tubular tires in a friend‚Äôs cellar. She did spend another year in France, but not until 1988/1989 with her husband, Sheldon Brown, and their children Tova and George. The clothes and books were intact. The tubulars had hardened to a rock-like state and were unusable. The frame met another fate.</p>

<h2>Cannondale</h2>
<p>In 1983, Cannondale manufactured its first aluminum bicycle (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannondale_Bicycle_Corporation">Wikipedia 2016</a>). Gary Klein had been issued patents on aluminum bicycle frames and sued Cannondale for patent infringement. Schwinn was already making large-diameter aluminum frames and paid Klein license fees. Cannondale claimed that Klein was not entitled to his patent(s) because the real design came out of Marc Rosenbaum's thesis and the 1974 Aluminum Bike Project (<a href="https://www.bikeforums.net/classic-vintage/601292-aluminum-revolution.html">Bike Forums mtnbke 2009</a>)(<a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/884/1399/464210/">Justia 1989</a>) Marc Rosenbaum was subpoenaed in the Cannondale/Klein case and gave a 6-hour videotaped deposition. He hid his bicycle in a friend‚Äôs barn so it wouldn‚Äôt be subpoenaed. He was afraid he would lose the bicycle for years and possibly never get it back if it were taken.</p>
<figure>

  <figcaption>Harriet's frame<br>Defendant exhibit in Cannondale case</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Cannondale‚Äôs lawyer wanted frame(s) that were built before Klein‚Äôs for the case. He contacted Shawn Buckley who told him that there were five light/strong frames produced in the project. The lawyer called Harriet to ask if he could use her frame and she said, ‚ÄúYes, but it‚Äôs in a friend‚Äôs cellar in France.‚Äù He visited her friends and brought the frame back for the trial.</p>

<p>Bringing in large diameter aluminum frames built by Bill Shook, founder and engineer of <a href="https://amclassic.com/company">American Classic </a>, and by Harriet Fell that predated Mr. Klein‚Äôs, Cannondale successfully argued that the Klein patent was null and void due to "prior art" - you can‚Äôt patent something that‚Äôs already in existence and known publicly (<a href="https://www.bikeforums.net/classic-vintage/601292-aluminum-revolution.html">Bike Forums tcs 2009</a>).</p>

<p>Klein's patent discovery documents had referenced Marc's bike and thesis numerous times, and it had taken Klein almost eight years to be granted a patent. Essentially, Cannondale asked, "Why is Klein's bike different from Rosenbaum's frame?"</p>



<h2>From Frame to Bike</h2>
<p>Marc was right to fear losing his bicycle for many years if it were subpoenaed. Cannondale kept Harriet's frame for many years and never let her know where it actually was. Eventually she asked her husband, Sheldon Brown, who worked in the bicycle business, to call a friend at Cannondale and ask for the frame. That worked. When the frame arrived, Sheldon hung it high on a living room wall and told every visitor about it.</p>

<p>In May 2005, Sheldon asked Harriet what she wanted for Mother's Day. She said, "Sheldon, since we've been married you've built up about 40 bikes for yourself (<a href="https://sheldonbrown.com/org/bicycle.html">Sheldon Brown's Personal Bicycle Page</a>) so how about getting that one on the road for me." 
He built the aluminum frame up with standard, fairly light-weight parts. Harriet has recently changed the saddle to a Brooks Cambium and added lights, a Quad-Lock mount for an iPhone, and a small frame bag with USB charger, all easily removable.

<h2>Proof in the Riding</h2>
<p>Marc Rosenbaum rode his bicycle up Mount Washington twice<sup><a href="#Foot4">4</a></sup> before donating it to the MIT Museum. Bill Shook rode his homemade bicycle frame in several races (<a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/884/1399/464210/">Justia 1989</a>). Harriet Fell continues to ride hers around the western suburbs of Boston.</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<p><a id="Foot1"></a>1. From correspondence from Marc Rosenbaum: "For solid tubes, section modulus is proportional to radius (or diameter) cubed, so strength increases with the cube of diameter. Moment of inertia is proportional to diameter to the fourth power, so stiffness increases with the fourth power of diameter.<br>For hollow tubes, it's not as cut and dried. If you double the diameter and double the wall thickness, then strength goes up as the cube and stiffness as the fourth power. If the wall thickness remains constant, doubling the diameter doesn't increase strength by 8 and stiffness by 16."</p>
<p><a id="Foot2"></a>2. It is an opportunity for MIT students, faculty and staff to organize or participate in a wide variety of courses ranging from Blacksmithing to Charm School.</p>
<p><a id="Foot3"></a>3. Harriet‚Äôs frame did not show any sagging due to annealing. The tubes on her frame were shorter than those on Marc‚Äôs bicycle and had slightly thicker walls.</p>
<p><a id="Foot4"></a>4. He did not ride this with the original 72" gear. He rode Mt Washington in 1975 alone as the race organizers wouldn't allow him in the race with a  fixed gear bike. He rode a 1:1 gear - 20T rear and made the front chaining from a Sturmey Archer 3 speed cog (so about a 27‚Äù gear). The next year he rode the bicycle in the race, having installed a single speed freewheel with an 18T (so about a 30‚Äù gear).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The Project SWIFT fabrication line was based on sectors, as shown in this patent diagram of the system from 1973. Each sector contained in an enclosure all of the wafer-processing equipment needed to accomplish a segment of the fabrication process between lithographic-pattern exposures.</p><p>
        IBM/U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
    </p><div data-headline="The Forgotten Story of How IBM Invented the Automated Fab"><p><strong>In 1970, Bill Harding </strong>envisioned a fully automated wafer-fabrication line that would produce integrated circuits in less than one day. Not only was such a goal gutsy 54 years ago, it would be bold even in today‚Äôs billion-dollar fabs, where the fabrication time of an advanced IC is measured in weeks, not days. Back then, ICs, such as random-access memory chips, were typically produced in a monthlong stop-and-go march through dozens of manual work stations.
</p><p>
	At the time, Harding was the manager of IBM‚Äôs Manufacturing Research group, in 
	<a href="https://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/money/companies/ibm/2014/07/12/ibm-history-fishkill-microprocessors/12583461/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">East Fishkill, N.Y</a>. The project he would lead to make his vision a reality, all but unknown today, was called Project SWIFT. To achieve such an amazingly short turnaround time required a level of automation that could only be accomplished by a paradigm shift in the design of <a href="https://www.hitachi-hightech.com/global/en/knowledge/semiconductor/room/manufacturing/process.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">integrated-circuit manufacturing</a> lines. Harding and his team accomplished it, achieving advances that would eventually be reflected throughout the global semiconductor industry. Many of SWIFT‚Äôs groundbreaking innovations are now commonplace in today‚Äôs highly automated chip fabrication plants, but SWIFT‚Äôs incredibly short turnaround time has never been equaled.
</p><p>
	SWIFT averaged 5 hours to complete each layer of its fabrication process, while the fastest modern fabs take 19 hours per processing layer, and the industry average is 36 hours. Although today‚Äôs integrated circuits are built with many more layers, on larger wafers the size of small pizzas, and the processing is more complex, those factors do not altogether close the gap. Harding‚Äôs automated manufacturing line was really, truly, swift.
</p><h2> A Semiconductor Manufacturing Manifesto</h2><p>
	I encountered Harding for the first time in 1962, and hoped it would be the last. 
	<a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IBM</a> was gearing up to produce its first completely solid-state computer, the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/building-the-system360-mainframe-nearly-destroyed-ibm" target="_self">System/360</a>. It was a somewhat rocky encounter. ‚ÄúWhat the hell good is that?‚Äù he bellowed at me as I demonstrated how tiny, unpackaged semiconductor dice could be automatically handled in bulk for testing and sorting.

William E. ‚ÄúBill‚Äù Harding [bottom right], seen here in 1973, was a brusque WW II combat veteran and creative innovator. He conceived and directed IBM‚Äôs Project SWIFT, which succeeded in fabricating integrated circuits in one day.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Clockwise from top: IBM/Computer History Museum; <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ibm">IBM</a> (2)</small></p><p><a href="https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/sandiegouniontribune/name/william-harding-obituary?id=20554418" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">William E. (‚ÄúBill‚Äù) Harding</a> was an innovative thinker and inventor. He had been developing <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/semiconductors/">semiconductors</a> and their manufacturing technology at IBM for three years when the company‚Äôs new <a href="https://ibm-1401.info/Highlights-of-IBM-History.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Components Division</a> was formed in 1961. Harding became a midlevel manager in the new division, responsible for developing and producing the equipment required to manufacture the System/360‚Äôs solid-state devices and circuit modules.
</p><p>
	He was rough around the edges for an IBM manager. But perhaps it was to be expected of someone who had grown up in Brooklyn, N.Y., and was wounded three times in combat in World War II while serving in General George S. Patton‚Äôs Third Army. After the war, Harding earned bachelor‚Äôs and master‚Äôs degrees in mathematics and physics and became a member of IEEE.
</p><p>
	I joined IBM in 1961, coming from rocket-engine development at General Electric. Like most engineers at the time, I knew nothing about semiconductor manufacturing. Five years prior, I had attended a vacuum-tube electronics course in which the professor described the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/transistor">transistor</a> as ‚Äúa laboratory curiosity, which may or may not ever amount to anything.‚Äù

	Harding‚Äôs rough and crude manner surfaced every time I crossed paths with him. If he ever went to IBM 
	<a href="https://www.ese.wustl.edu/~nehorai/paper/silverman.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">‚Äúcharm school‚Äù</a> (management training), there was no discernible evidence of it. Nevertheless, he succeeded in his mission. By 1964, solid-state logic modules for System/360s were flowing from the Components Division‚Äôs new facility on a former farm in East Fishkill.
</p><p>
	In July 1970, I returned to IBM after three years of graduate study. I was a first-level manager for four years prior to that educational break, and did not want another management job. I wanted a purely technical career, and I joined East Fishkill‚Äôs Manufacturing Research (MR) group hoping to get one.
</p><p>
	Harding and I then crossed paths again. In mid-August of 1970, he became MR‚Äôs top manager. Prior to that, he spent a year developing an IBM corporate strategy for the future manufacturing and use of 
	<a href="https://vlsiweb.com/the-history-of-vlsi/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">very-large-scale integrated</a> (VLSI) circuits. He was given command of MR to demonstrate the viability of his manufacturing concepts.
</p><p>
	An assembly of MR personnel was convened to announce the management change. After being introduced, Harding described his view of future VLSI applications and manufacturing. These were his key points:
</p><ul><li>VLSI circuits would be based on field-effect transistor technology (at the time, bipolar-junction transistors were dominant);</li><li>Defect-free high yields would be paramount;</li><li>Manufacturing would be fully automated;</li><li>Best results would accrue from processing one wafer at a time;</li><li>Short turnaround times would confer important benefits;</li><li>Volume would scale up by replicating successful production lines.</li></ul><p>
	After the educational lecture, Harding changed from professor to commander, General Patton‚Äìstyle. MR‚Äôs sole mission was to demonstrate Harding‚Äôs ideas, and ongoing projects not aligned with that goal would be transferred elsewhere within IBM or abandoned. MR would prove that an automated system could be constructed to process about 100 wafers a day, one at a time, with high yield and a one-day turnaround time.
</p><p><em><em>What?</em></em> Did I hear that right? One-day turnaround from bare wafer to finished circuits was what we would now call a moon shot. Remember, at the time, it typically took more than a month. Did he really mean it?
</p><p>
	Harding knew that it was theoretically possible, and he was determined to achieve it. He declared that IBM would have a substantial competitive advantage if prototype experimental IC designs could be produced in a day, instead of months. He wanted the circuit designer to have testable circuits the day after submitting the digital description to the production line.
</p><p>One-day turnaround from bare wafer to finished circuits was what we would now call a moon shot.</p><p>
	Harding immediately organized an equipment group and a process group within MR, naming me to manage the equipment group. I did not want to be a manager again. Now, reluctantly, I was a second-level manager, responsible for developing all the processing and wafer-handling equipment for a yet-to-be-defined manufacturing line that I had barely started to visualize. My dream research job had lasted little more than a month.
</p><p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37377557600" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Walter J. (‚ÄúWally‚Äù) Kleinfelder</a> transferred into MR to manage the process group. They would select the product to manufacture and define the process by which it would be made‚Äîthe detailed sequence of chemical, thermal, and lithographic steps required to take a blank silicon wafer and build integrated circuits on its surface at high yield.
</p><p>
	Kleinfelder selected a random-access memory chip, the IBM RAM II, for our demonstration. This product was being produced on-site at East Fishkill, so we would have everything we needed to build it and evaluate our results relative to those of the existing nonautomated manufacturing line.
</p><h2>IBM‚Äôs SWIFT Pilot Wafer Fab Had a Monorail ‚ÄúTaxi‚Äù</h2><p>
	Integrated-circuit manufacturing involves first creating the transistors and other components in their proper places on the silicon wafer surface, and then wiring them together by adding a thin film of aluminum selectively etched to create the required wiring pattern. That thin film of conductor is known as the wiring, or metallization, layer.
</p><p>
	IC manufacturing uses 
	<a href="https://mirai-intex.com/blog/photolithography-in-chip-making-process" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">photolithography</a> to create the many layers, each with a distinctive pattern, needed to fabricate an IC. These include the metal wiring layers, of which there can be more than a dozen for an advanced chip today. For these steps, the metal layer on the wafer is coated with a light-sensitive <a href="https://www.universitywafer.com/photoresist.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">photoresist</a> material, after which an image of the pattern is exposed on to it. The areas where conductors will be formed are blocked from the light. When the image is developed, the resist is removed from the pattern areas that were exposed, enabling these areas to be etched by an acid. The rest of the surface remains protected by the acid-proof resist. After etching is completed, the remaining protective resist is removed, leaving just the wiring layer in the required pattern.
</p><p>
	The IC process also uses lithography to create transistors and other components on the silicon wafer. Here, openings are etched in insulating layers through which tiny amounts of specific impurities can be infused into the exposed spots of pure silicon to change the electrical properties. Producing the RAM-II ICs required four separate lithographic operations using four different patterns: three for creating the transistors and other components, and one to create the metal wiring layer. The four patterns had to be exactly aligned with one another to successfully create the chips.
</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLLVOwB7i3g" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lithography</a> is only part of the IC manufacturing process, however. In the existing production line, it took many weeks to process a RAM-II wafer. But the raw process time‚Äîthe time a wafer spent actually being worked on at various thermal, lithographic, chemical, and deposition stations‚Äîwas less than 48 hours. Most of a wafer‚Äôs time was spent waiting to undergo the next process step. And some steps, chemical cleaning in particular, could be eliminated if wafers progressed quickly from one step to the next.
</p><p>
	It was the responsibility of Kleinfelder‚Äôs group to determine which steps could be eliminated and which could be accelerated. The resulting raw process time was less than 15 hours. It then fell to 
	<a href="https://www.sigmaxi.org/members/sigma-xi-fellows/2021-fellows/maung-htoo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maung Htoo</a>, my manager of chemical-equipment development, to test the proposed process. His people hustled 1.25-inch-diameter wafers through a ‚Äúpots and pans‚Äù lab setup to evaluate and refine it. The abbreviated procedure successfully produced working circuits in about 15 hours, as anticipated.
</p><p>
	The architecture of an automated system materialized. It was initially envisioned as a series of linked machines, each performing one step of the process, like an automobile assembly line. But equipment downtime for preventative maintenance and repair of breakdowns had to be accommodated. This was achieved by the insertion of short-term storage ‚Äúbuffers‚Äù that would temporarily store wafers at selected points in the process chain when necessary.
</p><p>
	This process chain concept was further disrupted by considerations related to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-little-light-magic" target="_blank">lithographic-pattern imaging</a>. Exposure of the photoresist on wafers was commonly accomplished at the time by a process analogous to photographic contact printing. The lithographic mask, through which light shone when exposing the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/getting-euv-ready-for-2020" target="_blank">photoresist</a>, was the equivalent of a photographic negative. Any defect or particle on the mask would result in a corresponding defect on a chip, at the same location, wafer after wafer.
</p><p>
	The East Fishkill lithography group had developed a noncontact 10:1 reduction 
	<a href="https://www.chemeurope.com/en/encyclopedia/Stepper.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">step-and-repeat image projector</a>. Think of it as a sort of photographic slide projector that produced a shrunken image containing the pattern for a single layer on a chip. It then ‚Äústepped‚Äù across the wafer, exposing one chip location at a time. Relative to contact masking, the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/seeing-double" target="_blank">stepper</a> promised lower sensitivity to particulate contamination, because the size of the shadow of any stray particle would be reduced by 10:1. Other advantages included higher optical resolution and longer mask life.
</p><p><span data-rm-shortcode-id="74c329d80d758b7acc0f60a2cd5d71ea"><iframe frameborder="0" height="auto" type="lazy-iframe" scrolling="no" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qFUSkFbKlXs?rel=0" width="100%"></iframe></span><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">- YouTube</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit..."><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFUSkFbKlXs" target="_blank">www.youtube.com</a></small></p><p>
	Because it was slow, though, multiple steppers would be needed to meet the throughput target. Achieving the best pattern alignment on each wafer for multiple pattern exposures required that a wafer be routed back to the same stepper for exposure of each layer in the process chain. That would cancel the effect of image distortions introduced by slight variations from one machine to another. Building the RAM-II circuits then required that a wafer make four separate trips to its assigned stepper. That divided the linear sequence into five sectors. A monorail ‚Äútaxi‚Äù would take a wafer from one processing sector to its assigned stepper, and return later to take it to its next sector.
</p><p>
	Each of the five sectors was envisioned to be an enclosure containing all of the automated wafer-processing and handling equipment required to accomplish that segment of the process chain. The sector enclosures and the taxi would be designed to provide a clean-room-quality local environment for the wafers. Within a sector enclosure, typically, a wafer would pass directly from a wet-chemistry module to miniature furnaces to a photoresist application module, and, finally, to the taxi pickup port. Inside the wet-chemistry module, for example, the wafer would undergo cleaning, development of the photoresist and its removal, and etching, among other procedures.
</p><p>
	Control of the entire line was to be accomplished at three levels. Overall production-line management, recordkeeping, taxi logistics, and process monitoring would be handled by a central computer-based system. Dedicated controllers, one for each sector, would manage wafer logistics within the sector and feed wafer traffic and processing data to the central system. The individual processing and wafer-handling modules inside each sector enclosure would have their own specialized controls, as needed, for independent setup and maintenance.
</p><p>
	Finally configured, our automated demonstration line for the RAM-II chips would consist of five sectors, a taxi, and a lithographic-pattern imaging center, all managed by computer. Six months after Harding took command, MR started to design and build the actual system.
</p><h2>The Brash Middle Manager Found Inspiration in Literature</h2><p>
	Harding made frequent trips to 
	<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/091797ibm.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IBM‚Äôs headquarters</a>, in Armonk, N.Y., to report progress, request resources, rebut challenges, and convince the top brass that the money being spent was a good investment in the future. It was a tough mission. His lengthy weekly staff meetings often reflected the pressure he was under. He lectured at length on things he knew we knew, told allegorical stories, and spun analogies.
</p><p>
	At the time, I did not realize that he was using his staff meetings to develop and refine ideas for the presentations at Armonk. He was noting our reactions and adjusting his presentation ideas accordingly. His presentations to the top brass were effective. For the duration of the project, spanning about three years, MR had all the funding and support it needed to develop, design, build, and operate the entire system.
</p><p>
	At one staff meeting, Harding read aloud Heywood Broun‚Äôs short story ‚Äú
	<a href="https://zameroskiwebpage.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/3/2/13324979/the_51st_dragon.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The 51st Dragon</a>,‚Äù to emphasize the power of a name or slogan to motivate people to achieve the impossible. His point, of course, was that we needed a really good name for the project. ‚ÄúSWIFT‚Äù was eventually chosen. Harding always insisted that it was not an acronym, but nevertheless people figured it was shorthand for ‚ÄúSemiconductor Wafer Integrated Factory Technology.‚Äù
</p><p>SWIFT‚Äôs incredibly short turnaround time has never been equaled.</p><p>
	SWIFT‚Äôs processing and wafer-handling equipment was custom designed entirely within IBM‚Äôs Components Division. The primary design objectives were to process wafers automatically, consistently, and uniformly and keep them clean and undamaged. Wafer-handling experiments sorted out the cleanest and gentlest techniques. Handling equipment was designed to support the wafer rather than grip it. A novel wafer handler that used a flow of air above the wafer to lift it, without physical contact, was successfully incorporated for some of the wafer-transport moves.
</p><p>
	There was one exception to the ‚Äúclean and gentle‚Äù design of SWIFT‚Äôs handling apparatus. Management at the Components Division‚Äôs Burlington, Vt., site pressured Harding to use ‚Äúair-track‚Äù wafer-transport equipment that they had developed. This equipment used airflow to lift and move wafers, much like a puck in a game of air hockey. Harding needed Burlington‚Äôs continued support, so he decreed that some air-track equipment be used in SWIFT. And it was, even though wafer-contamination and reliability questions were unresolved.
</p><p>
	Another top-down decree explains why SWIFT ended up with two different types of sector control systems‚Äîthe antithesis of good design for maintainability. A custom controller had been designed, and five units were being built (one for each sector), when HQ required that we incorporate the newly announced 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IBM System/7</a>, which had been developed specifically for factory-equipment and process-control applications. After all, if IBM itself didn‚Äôt use the computer in its own advanced production line, potential customers would wonder ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù But if SWIFT used a System/7 and the project proved to be successful, it would help sell System/7s. And so for the five sectors, SWIFT ended up with four custom controllers and one System/7. Both types worked well.
</p><p>
	Equipment reliability was SWIFT‚Äôs Achilles‚Äô heel. To help achieve high reliability and ease of maintenance, certain mechanisms and controls were standardized for use throughout the system, and they were chosen for reliability and simplicity rather than novelty or elegance. For example, a person observing the system in operation would notice that many motions were accomplished in discrete smooth steps rather than a single traverse. Underlying that peculiarity was the extensive use of the simple, robust, and reliable 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_drive" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Geneva drive</a>, originally developed centuries ago for clocks, but now adapted for linear and rotary motions that had to be smooth and precisely locked in at the end points. Each easily controlled turn of the Geneva drive‚Äôs input shaft made one step. Long traverses required multiple turns of the shaft, resulting in the odd-looking motions.
</p><p><img alt="An illustration of a process. (Ask Glenn)" data-rm-shortcode-id="38f0234fd43a8a2ead8c81079e345fce" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-of-a-process-ask-glenn.png?id=54904861&amp;width=980" height="2599" id="cf4be" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-of-a-process-ask-glenn.png?id=54904861&amp;width=980" width="2763"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Inside a sector‚Äôs enclosed chamber, a wafer went through a series of entirely automated processing steps. Two of the early concept sketches are represented here. The wafers came into the upper chamber with a pattern exposed onto the resist and underwent a series of processing steps that included development, hardening, etching, and others, as indicated. </small></p><p>
	Another simplification involved spinning the wafers to centrifugally spread liquid photoresist that was dropped onto the center of the wafer. In existing lines, ‚Äúwrong spin speed‚Äù was frequently cited as the cause of resist-related wafer-processing rejects. Spin speed was eliminated as a variable by driving SWIFT‚Äôs spinners with synchronous AC motors locked to 3,600 rpm by their 60-hertz AC power source, just as phonograph turntables are driven. No speed controllers would be required. The desired photoresist film thickness would be achieved by adjusting the remaining variables‚Äîtemperature, viscosity, and/or spin time. In the end, system reliability was improved by the elimination of four separate speed controllers.
</p><p>
	As SWIFT progressed from blue-sky concept to actual hardware implementation, Harding adjusted MR‚Äôs organization and gained the cooperation of supporting groups. He saw to it that his people had the resources to do the job and could focus on the project. I came to admire his organizational skills and his ability to single out and recruit top-notch talent from within the company.

	Harding established a group to develop SWIFT‚Äôs master control system, which monitored the progress on each and every wafer as it moved through the sectors. This Execution Control System (ECS) was based on an 
	<a href="https://tcm.computerhistory.org/ComputerTimeline/Chap33_ibm1800_CS1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IBM 1800</a>. Each wafer had a serial number and was tracked at every step through the line. The ECS stored and monitored each wafer‚Äôs processing parameters, detecting and reacting quickly to out-of-spec situations. Its punch cards and tape cartridges seem quaint by today‚Äôs measure, but it was a major advance in production control and monitoring for a wafer line.
</p><p>
	He also transferred an entire instrumentation department, managed by Sam Campbell, from IBM Endicott to East Fishkill. Campbell‚Äôs department subsequently developed groundbreaking methods for real-time, in-situ process control for SWIFT.
</p><h2>A Short Life but an Enduring Legacy in Semiconductor Manufacturing</h2><p>
	Mockups of furnaces and chemical processors were built and tested. 
	<a href="https://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/local/2014/10/20/ibm-straub-east-fishkill/17625349/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Robert J. Straub</a>‚Äôs department in East Fishkill‚Äôs Manufacturing Engineering group designed and built the sectors and the processing equipment modules within them. Harding brought in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bevanwu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bevan P.F. Wu</a> to manage the installation, debugging, and operation of the line. As equipment and facilities coalesced in SWIFT‚Äôs dedicated 4,000-square-foot space, <a href="https://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/local/2014/10/20/ibm-east-fishkill-brunner/17624973/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rolf H. Brunner</a>, who had managed a good portion of the sector designs along with development of the vacuum metal-deposition equipment, took responsibility under Wu for equipment installation, startup, and debugging.
</p><p>
	Only one operation in the entire process was not fully automated. Alignment of the wafer for exposing the pattern on the photoresist still depended on a well-trained operator. In its final form, SWIFT had both a 10:1 optical stepper and also a 1:1 contact-mask machine, but as it happened, most of the chips produced were with the 1:1 machine, because the throughput was higher that way.
</p><p>
	By the end of 1973, IBM HQ was already convinced that full automation of wafer processing could succeed. So much so that this goal was adopted as a primary objective for a new wafer-processing line to produce the circuits for IBM‚Äôs next-generation computer, the ‚ÄúFS‚Äù (
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Future_Systems_project" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Future System</a>). The proposed new line was dubbed ‚ÄúFMS‚Äù (Future Manufacturing System), and SWIFT was renamed ‚ÄúFMS Feasibility Line.‚Äù
</p><p>
	Bevan Wu successfully managed the line‚Äôs completion, test runs, personnel training, and refinements of equipment, process, and procedures. He brought the line to the point of being qualified to produce circuits for IBM products. The system made five continuous-operation runs between mid-1974 and early 1975. Between runs, his group analyzed results and implemented improvements. The longest continuous run spanned 12 days. Wafer throughput averaged 58 wafers per day, 83 percent of its designed maximum. Average turnaround time from bare-wafer input to testable-circuits output was about 20 hours. The raw process time was 14 hours. The yield ultimately equaled the best ever achieved by East Fishkill‚Äôs conventional RAM-II production line.
</p><p>
	A total of 135 technicians, engineers, and managers from IBM locations worldwide were trained on the operation of the system. They produced 600 product-quality wafers with 17,000 RAM-II FET memory chips.
</p><p>
	But like his WWII commander, General Patton, Harding was bypassed to lead ‚Äúthe big show‚Äù‚Äîin Harding‚Äôs case, the creation of the new FMS automated line. Leaving the management career ladder behind, he was promoted to IBM Fellow, the highest nonmanagement level in the company.
</p><p>
	The FMS Feasibility Line, originally SWIFT, made its last continuous run in early 1975. It had accomplished its objectives. Its people were now needed to help create the FMS line to produce FS computers. But later in 1975, the FS project was canceled, and FMS became superfluous. A portion of the equipment destined for FMS became East Fishkill‚Äôs 
	<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1156072" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">QTAT (Quick Turn Around Time)</a> line, a groundbreaking IBM showpiece that is better remembered than its obscure predecessor, Project SWIFT.
</p><p>
	Although SWIFT‚Äôs life was short, and it was never in the limelight, its many innovations are clearly visible in today‚Äôs semiconductor fabs. Like SWIFT, these fabs are highly automated and computer controlled; have a central transport system and ‚ÄúBernoulli‚Äù handlers, which exploit the flow of air to lift wafers without making physical contact; apply resist immediately after oxide or metal film formation; use steppers for lithographic pattern exposure; and employ real-time process control. All of these were groundbreaking features of Project SWIFT 50 years ago.
</p><p>
	The experience of working under Harding on SWIFT for three years was, for me, transformative. What had started with trepidation ended with admiration. I have come to consider Bill Harding a true genius, in his own way. Spurred on and supported by his unique management style, a small group of dedicated people achieved far more than anyone initially envisioned. More than even we ourselves thought possible.
</p><p>
	We think of the first achievers in an industry as the ‚Äúfathers‚Äù of the modern embodiment of their inventions. Edison, Bell, Ford, and the Wright brothers, are commonly spoken of this way. In that sense, William E. Harding is clearly the father of the modern, automated, billion-dollar fab.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Dynamic and polymorphic languages must attach information, such as types, to run time objects, and therefore adapt the memory layout of values to include space for this information. This is especially problematic in the case of IEEE754 double-precision floating-point numbers, which require exactly 64 bits, leaving no space for type information. The two main encodings in-use to this day, tagged pointers and NaN-tagging, either allocate floats on the heap or unbox them at the cost of an overhead when handling all other objects.
<br>This paper presents self-tagging, a new approach to object tagging that can attach type information to 64-bit objects while retaining the ability to use all of their 64 bits for data. At its core, self-tagging exploits the fact that some bit sequences appear with very high probability. Superimposing tags with these frequent sequences allows encoding both 64-bit data and type within a single machine word. Implementations of self-tagging demonstrate that it unboxes all floats in practice, accelerating the execution time of float-intensive benchmarks in Scheme by 2.3$\times$, and in JavaScript by 2.7$\times$ without impacting the performance of other benchmarks, which makes it a good alternative to both tagged pointers and NaN-tagging.

                            Knap stukje werk van 'betrokken' artsen/specialisten en onderzoekers, dat door een onmogelijk rationeel te bezien traject tot goedkeuring en gebruik misschien niet toegepast kan/mag worden.</p><p>

Schitterend ook, die volledige 'gladstrijkende' trajectmedewerking van een EMA waarvan iedere Europeaan mag verwachten dat die er zijn voor hun belang alleen.</p><p>

Dan gaan we maar niet vragen* waarom dit soort prachtige initiatieven niet zijn 'opgepikt' in een Brussel, en er met de opgebrachte gemeenschapsgelden niet al een European Lab voor dit type betaalbare alternatieven is opgericht!</p><p>

*omdat men daar vooral bezig is met 'zelfverrijking projecten' en het 'achter de feiten aanlopen'!

                            Hmm die laatste conclusie lijkt me te gemakkelijk. Ik weet niet hoe de EMA precies werkt maar ik verwacht niet dat het primair op zelfverrijking gericht zijn, in tegenstelling tot die farmaceutische bedrijven. Bovendien zullen er heus ook in Europa dubieuze bedrijven en ook academici zijn die liever willen profiteren dan zorgvuldig handelen. Dan is een bureaucratische moloch als de EMA misschien zo slecht nog niet.

                            Ik heb het hier over het fenomeen "Brussel" in het algemeen en niet specifiek over een EMA.<br>
Waarom is er door al die leden in de diverse Commissies en al die 750 parlementsleden met hun gehele ambtelijke ondersteuning nu nooit eens gedacht; "misschien moeten we eens zelf hier in Europa een groot medisch research centrum faciliteren"? </p><p>

Het algehele 'succesful track record' van de club in Brussel op elk vlak is uiterst mager!!!!

                            Als de methoden van het AVL en die van Iovance verschillend genoeg zijn, dan kan er toch geen sprake zijn van 'de eerste wint'? Ik neem toch aan dat "succesvolle behandeling van specifiek type kanker" niet gepatenteerd kan worden. Dus ruimte voor beiden, en als de goedkoopste neits doet, dan maar die dure. Wat kan er kapitalistischer zijn dan dat? En als ze wel op elkaar lijken... tja dan wint niet niet automatisch de goedkoopste, hoewel ik in het geval van ziekten met slechte prognosen die hele octrooiwet het liefst op de vuilnisbelt zie belanden. Maar dat is een andere discussie.

                            De publieke sector is dus kennelijk in staat een product te leveren dat gelijkwaardig maar goedkoper is dan een commercieel product. Gebruik hiervan zorgt dat de totale kosten, inclusief zorgkosten, lager zijn.</p><p>

Bedrijven kunnen dan zeggen dat het oneerlijke concurrentie is.</p><p>

Maar kennelijk werkt de markt niet, want die zorgt er met concurrentie niet voor dat bedrijven hetzelfde of beter kunnen leveren voor minder totale kosten.</p><p>

Gegeven de florissante economische conditie van de meeste Nederlanders, moeten we dan als publiek kiezen voor <br>
(a) dogmatisch de markt volgen en vele malen teveel te betalen ten bate van aandeelhouders? <br>

                            De markt draait in principe om geld verdienen, hoe meer hoe beter. En dus niet om het maatschappelijk belang c.q. de volksgezondheid te dienen en zorg betaalbaar te houden. Volksgezondheid is niet meer dan een verdienmodel.</p><p>

Daarom is het mooi dat er een ziekenhuis laat zien dat het anders kan. Nu hopen dat het ook echt lukt en ze niet in de wielen worden gereden door die Amerikaanse bedrijven die natuurlijk miljoenen aan juridische procedures kunnen besteden...</p><p>

Ben ook benieuwd hoe onze overheid hier naar kijkt.

                            Hulde voor AVL. Big Pharma denkt alleen maar aan geld, niet aan onze gezondheid. Als ik lees hoe het proces verloopt, dan vraag ik me wel af hoe dat met de corona vaccins gegaan is. Misschien iets te snel door de bocht gegaan? Benieuwd hoe in de VS Big Pharma zal vergaan zodra Kennedy minister is.

                            Haanen werkt al zeker 20 jaar voor het ALV en heeft mijn in 2012 overleden vrouw met nierkanker 10 jaar lang fantastisch bijgestaan. Ik wens hem en zijn companen alle succes met het verkrijgen van de vergunning.</p><p>

Het onderscheid tussen markt en overheid in dit artikel is veel te dogmatisch</p><p>

Voor een goedwekende kapitalistische markt is concurrentie essentieel. Als die concurrentie ontbreekt ontstaan er monopoliewinsten en valt de prikkel om te verbeteren weg.    Bij het ontbreken van voldoende concurrentie zou het afgeven van vergunningen versoepeld moeten worden.</p><p>

Vroeger hanteerde de echt liberale prof Hennipman de stelling dat er tenminste 5 concurrerende aanbieders aanwezig zouden moeten zijn om het maken van overwinsten te voorkomen.  Ook in geval van monopolistische concurrentie,( zoals hier bij dure maar niet identieke kankermedicijnen), lijkt het hanteren van een kwantitatieve maatstaf gewenst.  </p><p>
  
Ik begrijp het probleem van het terugverdienen van de hoge researchkosten, maar vanuit maatschappelijk oogpunt is het ook belangrijk dat er efficient gewerkt wordt en dat onnodige uitgaven niet in de prijs van het geneesmiddel tot uitdrukking komen. </p><p>

Om dat doel te bereiken heb je concurrentie nodig.

Als er vanuit de private sector onvoldoende concurrentie komt (door hoge barriers to entree) zal de overheid of anders cooperaties daarvoor moeten zorgen. Zo hebben woningbouwcorporaties in het verleden de kwaliteit van de huisvestig bevordert.

<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p><code>TrunkVer</code> is a SemVer-compatible versioning scheme for
continuously-delivered, trunk-based applications and systems that don't follow a release scheme.</p>
<p>It is a <strong>drop-in replacement</strong> for semantic versions and replaces the version with meaningful meta data, telling you at a glance what the artifact is, when it was built and where you may find the build log.</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>We have identified a frequent source of avoidable confusion, conflict and cost in the software delivery process caused by versioning software that should not be versioned - or rather, the versioning should be automated.</p>
<p>Historically, countless versioning schemes have been used to signify changes to a piece of software, using a lot of not clearly defined words such as beta, final or release candidate as well as arbitrary numbering schemes that typically involve one or more digits that are incremented according to certain rules, or worse, without clear rules.</p>
<p>Over time, semantic versioning has been proposed and adopted by many developer teams for good reasons. It clearly defines what each part of a version number means, such as incrementing the first digit, or major version, to signify a change that is considered to be a ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù one. This can be used by both humans and machines to improve their work, such as a machine refusing to automatically apply an update in this case and notifying a human to adapt to the breaking change. We are fans of semantic versioning.</p>
<p>However, we keep encountering teams and organizations that apply semantic versioning or a custom versioning scheme to software that does not need any of that - and through this, they create an astonishing amount of unnecessary work such as arguing whether or not a certain piece of software should be called ‚Äúalpha‚Äù, ‚Äúbeta‚Äù, ‚Äúrho‚Äù, ‚Äúreally final v4‚Äù etc, manually creating tickets listing the changes or even specialized gatekeeper roles such as ‚Äúrelease engineer‚Äù - in the worst case a single person in the whole organization. Because this makes it harder, boring and costly to deploy, it systematically reduces the number of deployments, and through this the delivery performance of the organization.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that these efforts often stem from perfectly valid requirements of various stakeholders, such as the necessity to audit the release process, finding out what version of the software is currently running or adhering to a specific certified process. Ironically, the manual process around it makes this not only costly, but often defeats the intended purpose. We have seen audit trails missing commits, full of copy/paste errors, etc. We therefore argue the only way to get auditing right is by automating it too, including the version numbering.</p>
<p>In an organization that creates software in teams of trusted contributors that deploy software to controlled environments together, this kind of versioning ceremony can become a major hurdle to adopting the XP and DevOps practices of trunk-based development and continuous integration/deployment/delivery - and it can and should be replaced by a tiny amount of code.</p>
<h2>Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li>The TrunkVer is automatically created during the build process, typically as the first step, and then re-used across the build, e.g. to tag created images in a registry or as part of a file name.</li>
<li>There is a single source of truth for the current code - usually a git branch named <code>trunk</code>, <code>default</code> or <code>main</code>.</li>
<li>From the source, we create a deployable artifact of the software - e.g. a docker image, jar file or debian package. As described in the 12 factor principles, this artifact will be deployed to an environment by combining it with configuration not part of the artifact. Versioning deployments is tool-specific and out of scope</li>
<li>There are only release candidates. Every push to the trunk triggers an automated process that creates a potentially releasable artifact, and usually it is automatically released shortly after</li>
<li>Version numbers are useful to developers: While technically a build jobs id would be perfectly viable to use, we prepend a timestamp to make them sortable, and the source code revision to identify it without having to go through the build server.</li>
<li>All secondary artifacts of a release, such as tickets or a changelog, are automated created during the build, referencing the TrunkVer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Specification</h2>
<p>The key words ‚ÄúMUST‚Äù, ‚ÄúMUST NOT‚Äù, ‚ÄúREQUIRED‚Äù, ‚ÄúSHALL‚Äù, ‚ÄúSHALL NOT‚Äù, ‚ÄúSHOULD‚Äù, ‚ÄúSHOULD NOT‚Äù, ‚ÄúRECOMMENDED‚Äù, ‚ÄúMAY‚Äù, and ‚ÄúOPTIONAL‚Äù in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A TrunkVer is suitable for versioning of any artifact that may be released without any regard for compatibility with third parties integrating with the artifact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A TrunkVer may be used for an artifact, while SemVer or other versioning schemes may be used for specific interfaces to that artifact, e.g. REST APIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A TrunkVer is syntactically compatible with SemVer, although it does not respect its semantic interpretation of the version number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A TrunkVer consists of three components: A <strong>timestamp</strong>, a <strong>source reference</strong>, and <strong>a build reference</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>timestamp</strong> is precise to one second and always formatted in UTC i.e. <code>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</code>, e.g. <code>20241230142105</code>. It replaces the <strong>Major</strong> part of a SemVer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>source reference</strong> identifies the exact source code used to build the artifact. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics <code>[09-A-Za-z]</code>. Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. If the source reference is a git commit checksum, it may be truncated to 7 characters (<code>--short</code>) and be prefixed with a <code>g</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>build reference</strong> identifies the exact build job used to build the artifact. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphens <code>[0-9A-Za-z-]</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A TrunkVer is formatted as follows: The <strong>timestamp</strong>, followed by <code>.0.0-</code>, followed by the <strong>source reference</strong>, followed by <code>-</code>, followed by the <strong>build reference</strong>. It may be used to replace any SemVer version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, for the purpose of e.g. prereleases of an otherwise SemVer-versioned artifact, a TrunkVer may be assembled into the prerelease part of a SemVer version as follows: The <strong>timestamp</strong>, followed by <code>-</code>, followed by the <strong>source reference</strong>, followed by <code>-</code>, followed by the <strong>build reference</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Why only use the MAJOR SemVer part as a timestamp?</strong><br>
Tools (e.g. compliance, audit trails) might still classify a version based on SemVer semantics, hence TrunkVer always defensively implies breaking changes between versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why do you use the PRERELEASE SemVer part for source information and not BUILD?</strong><br>
Because OCI tags don't support <code>+</code> (see <a href="https://github.com/distribution/distribution/issues/1201">distribution/distribution#1201</a> and <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/issues/154">opencontainers/distribution-spec#154</a>. We'd rather have one consistent version across artifacts. Semantically, the only relevant portion for sorting of a TrunkVer is
the MAJOR version, and a conflict (as in creating two artifacts in the
very same second) should be avoided.</p>

<a href="https://soft-dev.org/pubs/html/diekmann_tratt__default_disambiguation/">research</a>,
I get asked questions about parsing fairly regularly, some of which I‚Äôm even
capable of answering.</p>
<p>One thing that I‚Äôve increasingly been made aware of is a widening interest in
‚Äúfancier‚Äù ways of editing text. In essence, most people who‚Äôve been programming
for a while come to realise that having an editor that only thinks of a program
as a sequence of UTF-8 characters is rather limiting. I suspect the rapid
proliferation of the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">LSP (Language Server
Protocol)</a> has opened
even more people‚Äôs eyes to what the editing of programs could be.</p>
<p>One long-standing approach to better editing is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_editor">structured
editing</a> (sometimes called
‚Äúprojectional editing‚Äù). The basic idea is to have an editor which fully
understands the syntactic structure of the language you‚Äôre editing. This has
various benefits: the editor can give instant feedback about what the next
thing the user can type is; it makes semantic-based feedback
(e.g. about the static typing of a program) much easier; it enables things
like ‚Äúselect this function so I can copy it‚Äù 100% accurate, instead of
using slightly dodgy heuristics; and so on.</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, the first structural editors were for Lisp
dialects in the late 1960s. The best modern structured editor I‚Äôve used is
JetBrains‚Äô <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/">MPS</a>. If you haven‚Äôt tried using a
structured editor, I‚Äôd encourage you to do so: it‚Äôs a much different experience
than using even an LSP-powered editor and can change how you view the editing
of programs.</p>
<p>However, there‚Äôs a reason why structured editors haven‚Äôt taken over the world:
most programmers find them so annoying to use in some situations that they
don‚Äôt view the pros as outweighing the cons. The basic problem is that most of us ‚Äì even
though we tend not to realise we‚Äôre doing so ‚Äì sometimes edit programs in
deliberate violation of their syntactic structure.</p>
<p>For example, I often use ‚Äúsquare block‚Äù editing, where I edit characters at
(say) columns 3‚Äì5 on all of lines 7‚Äì10 in a way that can suddenly turn a
syntactically valid program into one with multiple, often bizarre, syntactic
invalidities. Many structured editors simply don‚Äôt allow this sort of editing
at all, because it doesn‚Äôt fit into the paradigm. Personally I do this sort of
thing so often that if my editor were to forbid me from doing so, I
would ditch it for a ‚Äúmore stupid‚Äù editor that does allow it ‚Äî even if that
meant foregoing other, useful, cleverness.</p>
<p>I thus must admit to some frustration when I‚Äôm pointed at yet another attempt to make
structured editing work, that either doesn‚Äôt take this problem into account, or
does so in an hoc manner. Typically, especially as a tool matures, some
non-structural editing is allowed, but often only quite specific kinds, sometimes
requiring you telling the editor in advance that you want to temporarily do things
it rather you didn‚Äôt.</p>
<p>The reason I‚Äôm frustrated by this is that there is a published solution that
enables us, in many realistic situations, to get all the advantages of
structural editing while allowing non-structured editing: incremental parsing.
The basic idea of incremental parsing is to allow people to edit programs as if
they were sequences of UTF-8 characters but to maintain and update a parse tree
in the background. Crucially, that parse tree can be arbitrarily ‚Äúbroken‚Äù when
the user‚Äôs input is not syntactically correct, so users aren‚Äôt constrained by
the tree‚Äôs existence.</p>
<p>Specifically I have pointed many, many people over the years to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150920220626/http://harmonia.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/twagner-thesis.pdf">Tim Wagner‚Äôs
thesis on incremental
parsing</a>.
Tim‚Äôs thesis is the culmination of many people‚Äôs efforts over many
years on this subject: it‚Äôs not quite the final word on the subject, but it‚Äôs
close enough to serve as a real basis for practical tooling. My simplified
explanation of it is that it contains three main algorithms: an incremental
lexing algorithm; an incremental LR parsing algorithm; and an incremental GLR
(i.e. all context-free grammars) parsing algorithm. Its algorithms are little
short of beautiful: it allows programs to go from syntactically valid to
invalid to valid (and so on) in a manner that is efficient, and which makes
great sense to the programmer.</p>
<p>If you think that Tim‚Äôs thesis looks too academic to be plausible, you might be
interested to know that you‚Äôre probably already using a real implementation of
it: Max Brunsfeld, the dynamo behind
<a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">Tree-sitter</a>, has been clear about
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24494756">the influence of Tim‚Äôs work on
Tree-sitter</a>. That‚Äôs not to say
that there is nothing more to be done in the area of incremental parsing. Lukas
Diekmann, who works in the same research group as me, <a href="https://diekmann.uk/diekmann_phd.pdf">extended and
fixed</a> Tim‚Äôs algorithms. We later pushed
that work even further, showing how it can serve as the basis for editing
‚Äúcomposed‚Äù (or ‚Äúpolyglot‚Äù) programs <a href="https://soft-dev.org/pubs/html/diekmann_tratt__default_disambiguation/">in a satisfying
manner</a>.
I‚Äôm sure much more can be done in this vein!</p>
<p>I know that some people who‚Äôve worked on structured editing know and understand
incremental parsing, and specifically Tim‚Äôs work. They might not agree with me
on the practical utility of that work, which is totally fine ‚Äì technically
informed disagreement of this kind is part of how our society makes progress.</p>
<p>However, it is now clear to me that there is ongoing work on structured editing which
either doesn‚Äôt know about incremental parsing in general, or Tim‚Äôs algorithms
specifically. I hope this post serves as a useful advert to such folk that
incremental parsing exists, and Tim‚Äôs and Lukas‚Äôs theses specifically, are
absolutely worth the investment of time in reading.</p>
<p>I would love to see more progress in this area, and the more that those working
on it know the breadth of our existing knowledge, the more likely we are to
make meaningful progress. I hope to see more such progress soon!</p>
