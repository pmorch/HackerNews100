      <section>
        <p>Gretchen shared with me an absolutely fascinating post on Reddit today: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fossils/comments/1c4hldl/found_a_mandible_in_the_travertin_floor_at_my/?ref=johnhawks.net" rel="noreferrer">“Found a mandible in the travertin floor at my parents house”</a>. The poster is a dentist and visited his parents house to see the new travertine they installed. It's no surprise that he recognized something right away: </p><figure><img src="https://johnhawks.net/content/images/2024/04/travertine-jawbone-reddit-Kidipadeli75.jpg" alt="A polished section of travertine rock with an obvious cross-section of a jawbone" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1674" srcset="https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/travertine-jawbone-reddit-Kidipadeli75.jpg 600w, https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/travertine-jawbone-reddit-Kidipadeli75.jpg 1000w, https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w1600/2024/04/travertine-jawbone-reddit-Kidipadeli75.jpg 1600w, https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w2400/2024/04/travertine-jawbone-reddit-Kidipadeli75.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>This travertine would get the notice of any anthropologist. Photo: Reddit user </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kidipadeli75/?ref=johnhawks.net"><span>Kidipadeli75</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>A section cut at a slight angle through a very humanlike jaw! I'm working in South Africa currently and I showed the image to some of our fossil preparation specialists today. Everybody agreed it is pretty cool! </p><p>The Reddit user who posted the story (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kidipadeli75/?ref=johnhawks.net">Kidipadeli75</a>) has followed up with some updates over the course of the day. The travertine was sourced in Turkey, and a close search of some of the other installed panels revealed some other interesting possible fossils, although none are as strikingly identifiable as the mandible. A number of professionals have reached out to offer assistance and I have no doubt that they will be able to learn a lot about the ancient person whose jaw ended up in this rock. </p><p>This naturally raises a broader question: How many other people have installed travertine with hominin fossils inside? </p><p>Travertine is a limestone that forms near natural springs. Spring water that emerges from lime-rich bedrock often carries a high concentration of dissolved calcium carbonate. When the water evaporates or cools—especially near hot springs—this calcium carbonate precipitates as rock and may form very large deposits around the spring. Travertine has an interesting internal texture when polished, and often has color bands and inclusions of calcite crystals, which make it an appealing choice for decorative flooring or wall covering. </p><p>Travertine also commonly includes fossils. Many are fossil inclusions of algae, plants, and small animals—especially molluscs and crustaceans—that live within the spring water. Much larger animals may be found and humans are no exceptions: Several well-known hominin fossil discoveries are from travertine deposits. Most of these discoveries have happened because of quarrying of the travertine deposits for use in construction. </p><p>For example, the Steinrinne site is on a terrace of the Wipper River near Bilzingsleben, Germany. The site was quarried from the Middle Ages onward into the twentieth century. Naturalists took notice of the fossils there in the nineteenth century, and straight-tusked elephants, woolly rhinos, and macaques all occur in great numbers, dating to an interglacial period sometime between 470,000 and 280,000 years ago. Many of the archaeological discoveries at the site were made by Dietrich Mania starting in 1969. Excavations since then have identified stone tools and many animal bones with cutmarks from ancient humans who butchered them—even stone handaxes made from elephant bone. </p><figure><img src="https://johnhawks.net/content/images/2024/04/bilzingsleben-vlcek-reconstructions-landesmuseum-salle.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1756" height="1042" srcset="https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/bilzingsleben-vlcek-reconstructions-landesmuseum-salle.jpg 600w, https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/bilzingsleben-vlcek-reconstructions-landesmuseum-salle.jpg 1000w, https://johnhawks.net/content/images/size/w1600/2024/04/bilzingsleben-vlcek-reconstructions-landesmuseum-salle.jpg 1600w, https://johnhawks.net/content/images/2024/04/bilzingsleben-vlcek-reconstructions-landesmuseum-salle.jpg 1756w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Bilzingsleben cranial reconstructions by Vlček. Photo from Landesmuseum fur Vorgeschichte Halle (Saale), Germany</span></figcaption></figure><p>Parts of at least two hominin skulls and a mandible were uncovered in the travertine during Mania's excavations. The remains were first studied by Emanuel Vlček, who created reconstructions of the two skulls. They have many similarities with <em>Homo erectus</em>, as Vlček emphasized, including the thick cranial bone, thick and pronounced browridges, and highly angled occipital bone at the back of the skull. Today's scientists, while recognizing these aspects, more often consider the skulls as representatives of an early Neandertal or related population, which sometimes is known as <em>Homo heidelbergensis</em>. </p><p>Another fossil human was discovered in an even more dramatic way. In 2002, Mehmet Cihat Alcicek was examining fossils recovered from travertine quarries of the Denizli Basin of southwestern Turkey when he identified a cross-section of a hominin cranium. The upper and lower surfaces where the fossil was cut are well preserved, suggesting that more of the skull had likely been present but no more was found. Dating of the travertine by Anne-Marie Lebatard and collaborators in 2014 suggests that the individual lived sometime between 1.6 million and 1.2 million years ago. The quarry that produced the fossil is near the village of Kocabaş, and that is the name by which the fossil has been designated. </p><blockquote>“Given the nature of its discovery in a factory workshop, the hominin was unfortunately reduced to a standard rough-cut tile thickness of about 35 mm…” —John Kappelman and coworkers&nbsp;</blockquote><p>The shape of this portion of the Kocabaş skull and its thick supraorbital torus have led most researchers to identify it as a <em>Homo erectus</em> individual. The endocranial surface of the frontal bone has granular impressions that were initially suggested as possible evidence of tuberculosis infection. While this is still possible, later work suggested that these impressions may rather reflect a common condition in which the cranial bone remodels due to arachnoid cell growth.</p><p>The Kocabaş skull points to the most obvious question that Reddit posters shared: Why didn't anybody notice a human jaw in the travertine before it was installed in someone's house? </p><p>This question isn't so hard to answer. Quarries rough-cut travertine and other decorative stone into large panels, doing basic quality checks for gaps and large defects on the rough stone before polishing. Small defects and inclusions are the reason why people want travertine in the first place, so they don't merit special attention. Consumers who buy travertine usually browse samples in a showroom to choose the type of rock, and they don't see the actual panels or tile until installation. Tile or panels that are polished by machine and stacked in a workshop or factory for shipping are handled pretty quickly. </p><p>What this means is that there may be lots more hominin bones in people's floors and showers. </p><p>Most will be hard to recognize. Random cross-sections of hominin bones are tough to make out from other kinds of fossils without a lot of training. Noticing a fossil is not so hard, but I have to say that I've often been surprised at what the rest of a fossil looks like after skilled preparators painstakingly extract it from the surrounding rock. The ways that either nature or a masonry saw may slice a fossil don't correspond to an anatomy book, and a cross-section through part of a bone doesn't usually resemble an X-ray image of a whole bone. </p><p>Believe me, anthropologists don't want to hear about every blob of bone in your tile. Bones from other kinds of animals <strong>massively</strong> outnumber hominin bones in  large travertine deposits. Most tile and panels are cut thin enough that if a fossil not clearly identifiable from its exposed surface, the thin portion beneath the surface is not likely to identify it either. Nobody wants to drill into your shower wall on a wild goose chase. </p><p>But certainly somebody has more pieces of the mandible from the Reddit post, and more pieces of the Kocabaş individual are probably installed in hotel bathrooms all across Europe. If you take another look at your shower wall and suspect an ancient human is looking back at you, it might actually be one. </p><p>The broader point is that a lot of the archaeological and fossil record has emerged as a result of industrial processes and construction. Paleontologists are in an uneasy symbiosis with quarries. The work of the rockcutters exposes underground sections that scientists would never know for centuries, yet at the same time it destroys evidence that might be recovered with enough paleontological labor. It helps for workers to have some training to notice potentially interesting finds as they encounter them, and for paleontologists and archaeologists to be engaged with the industries and construction projects that often encounter ancient remains. </p><p>And if you do happen find a jawbone in your bathroom, my suggestion is first to contact the local authorities. Sure, a fossil in travertine likely comes from hundreds of thousands of years ago. It isn't a crime scene. But depending on your state or nation of residence, laws governing discovery of human remains on your property may be complicated and having the paperwork in order with the police, sheriff, or coroner is the first step for most investigations. </p><p>For myself, I'll be following the Reddit story with interest—I expect there will be many twists and turns in the story of this jawbone. With some teeth preserved and abundant surrounding rock, I expect that specialists will be able to learn a great deal about the life of this individual and when he or she lived. </p><p>Assuming, that is, the parents wouldn't rather keep it where it is installed now. </p><hr><p><em><strong>Notes:</strong> I've included some references for the Kocabaş and Bilzingsleben discoveries below. There is much more to say about both of them. Investigation of Middle Pleistocene and earlier travertine deposits is one of the most promising avenues to understand ancient environments in which human ancestors and relatives lived. </em></p><h3 id="references">References</h3><p>Kappelman, J., Alçiçek, M.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="entry-content" itemprop="text">
<p>According to the latest draft text of the controversial <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-04-11-conseil-csam-compromis-9-avril.pdf">EU Child Sexual Abuse Regulation proposal </a>leaked by the French news organization Contexte, <a href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/dokument/XXVII/EU/179658/imfname_11360113.pdf">which the EU member states discussed</a>, the EU interior ministers want to exempt professional accounts of staff of intelligence agencies, police and military from the envisaged scanning of chats and messages (Article 1 (2a)). The regulation should also not apply to “confidential information” such as professional secrets (Article 1 (2b)). The EU governments reject the idea that the new EU Child Protection Centre should support them in the prevention of child sexual abuse and develop best practices for prevention initiatives (Article 43(8)).</p>
<p>“The fact that the EU interior ministers want to exempt police officers, soldiers, intelligence officers and even themselves from chat control scanning proves that they know exactly just how unreliable and dangerous the snooping algorithms are that they want to unleash on us citizens,” commented Pirate Party MEP Patrick Breyer. “They seem to fear that even military secrets without any link to child sexual abuse could end up in the US at any time. The confidentiality of government communications is certainly important, but the same must apply to the protection of business and of course citizens communications, including the spaces that victims of abuse themselves need for secure exchanges and therapy. We know that most of the chats leaked by today’s voluntary snooping algorithms are of no relevance to the police, for example family photos or consensual sexting. It is outrageous that the EU interior ministers themselves do not want to suffer the consequences of the destruction of digital privacy of correspondence and secure encryption that they are imposing on us.”</p>
<p>“The promise that professional secrets should not be affected by chat control is a lie cast in paragraphs. No provider and no algorithm can know or determine whether a chat is being conducted with doctors, therapists, lawyers, defence lawyers, etc. so as to exempt it from chat control. Chat control inevitably threatens to leak intimate photos sent for medical purposes and trial documents sent for defending abuse victims.”</p>
<p>“It makes a mockery of the official goal of child protection that the EU interior ministers reject the development of best practices for preventing child sexual abuse. It couldn’t be clearer that the aim of this bill is China-style mass surveillance and not better protecting our children. Real child protection would require a systematic scientific evaluation and implementation of multidisciplinary prevention programmes, as well as Europe-wide standards and guidelines for criminal investigations into child abuse, including the identification of victims and the necessary technical means. None of this is planned by the EU interior ministers.”</p>
<p>The EU governments want to adopt the chat control bill by the beginning of June.</p>

<p><span><strong>Quick Note: I’m Going to CES and SPIE AR/VR/MR 2024</strong></span></p>



<p><span>Before getting to the article, I wanted my readers to know that I plan to attend CES from January 9th through the 12th. My schedule is just forming up as of this writing, so I currently have many time slots available. Most AR/VR/MR-specific companies exhibiting publicly will be in LVCC Central Hall or the Venetian like last year. While I am primarily there to meet with companies and see products, I always have some time to meet with blog fans.   </span></p>



<p><span>I will also attend the SPIE AR/MR/VR conference from January 29th through the 31st. It is much easier to meet at this conference as everything is in one building for the conference and exhibits. </span></p>



<p><span>If you want to meet up with me at either event, please email me at <strong>meet@kgontech.com</strong> </span></p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Humane AI (<strong>Humane</strong>, hereafter) combines the mid-2010s failed concept of using a laser projector to project on the body with the early 2000s failed projector phone (something <a href="https://kguttag.com/2013/08/04/whatever-happened-to-pico-projectors-embedding-in-phones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I wrote about in 2013</a>), only they left out the phone’s flat panel display and have more feeble processing than a good smartphone. Rational people wonder what this does that a good smartphone can’t do much better, and you can count me as one of these people. </p>

<p>This blog has been written about various laser projector scams since the beginning of 2011. Scammers like to associate “laser” with near-mystic powers that violate all the laws of physics and rational thought. The other favorite word to deceive people is “Hologram” (when they are not). The new favorite buzzword is “AI .” </p>



<p>It looks like Humane started with an abysmally poor-quality laser projector in a phone-like device, and by saying it does “AI,” it is magically something new. Their picture was good enough to raise $230 million from SK Networks (Korea), Microsoft, LG, Volvo, Qualcomm, Open AI founder Sam Alman, and others. Granted, with so many big-name companies, the stakes were chump change for each giant company giant, but it does show foolishness on a grand scale. </p>



<h2>Humane Adds AI to the Laser Projection (Hype Squared)</h2>



<p>At first glance, Human AI looks like it started with a monochrome laser projector, and realizing that that wouldn’t sell venture capital companies (VCs), they wrapped it in the current hype surrounding AI. Humane co-founders Bethany Bongiorno and Imran Chaudhri (left) have the “Steve Jobs” black shirt costume down like other famous Silicon Valley scammers, Elizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos, Sam Bankman-Fried founder of FTX, and Ronnie Abovitz, founder of Magic Leap. I have learned to be suspicious of the Steve Jobs pretender look through the years; it’s not a complete tell, but it should make you suspicious. </p>

<p>This blog has <a href="https://kguttag.com/?s=Laser+Projection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">documented for over 12 years</a> how <strong>laser scanning is a terrible way to generate a display image</strong>. In short, <strong>the scanning process is too slow and inaccurate to generate a high-resolution image</strong>, and the lasers can’t be controlled fast and accurately enough to give good color depth, not to mention the poor power efficiency. </p>

<h3>The fundamental problems with pico projection include:</h3>



<p>1. <strong>Where will you project from?</strong> Humane’s “big concept” is that they will magnetically pin the projector to your shirt or jacket,  ignoring that it will sag a normal shirt and flop around as one moves. For the Humane’s introduction video, they pinned it on a heavy leather (or leather-like) jacket to give support (what do you do in the summer?).</p>

<p>2. <strong>What and where will you project on?</strong> Humane’s “big concept,” taken from laser projector scams of the past (more on this later), is to project on the skin. But the skin is a lousy, non-smooth projection screen with crevices and poor reflective qualities.  Worse yet, it <strong>requires a person to hold their hand up wherever the projector happens to be pointing</strong> as it flops around hanging on your “shirt.” Unlike a phone display, you can hold where you want or sit down. </p>



<p>3. <strong>Ambient light is the biggest killer for pico projectors due to the loss of contrast</strong>. Humane has not specified the projector’s brightness (in lumens), but it has a class 2 laser, so it can’t be that bright when projecting an image compared to the brightness of daylight. Humane demonstration videos are “staged” to put the hand’s projection surface in shadow or a dark environment. The Humane display is guaranteed to be invisible in outdoor daylight, about 100 times brighter than typical indoor lighting. Unlike flat panel displays that absorb ambient light, projection displays directly compete with it.</p>



<p>4. <strong>Humane’s projector lacks color and grayscale depth.</strong> Humane’s display a monochrome cyan (blue-green). There is no ability to even highly anything with color. Secondly, they demonstrated very limited grayscale depth; they showed just “on,” “off,” and a half-level. Even if grayscale is theoretically possible with the Humane projector, the ability fo see a grayscale image is severely hampered by using skin as a screen and the lack of contrast due to ambient light.  </p>



<p>5. <strong>Laser projection’s focus-free is a double-edged sword</strong>. While using laser scanning allows the projected image to be “focus-free,” it also means that the smallest objects blocking the projected image cast a harsh shadow blocking part of the image. </p>

<h3>Humane’s Poor Image Quality &amp; 720p Resolution Lie</h3>



<p>Human claims to have a 720p (1280 x 720 pixel) <strong>monochrome</strong> resolution. <strong>All laser projector resolution claims I have seen through the years lie about their resolution</strong>, typically by about 2x horizontally and vertically. But <strong>Humane seems to have topped them by claiming about 4x of the horizontal and vertical resolution they can deliver</strong>. A picture of a 502- x 410-pixel Apple Watch Ultra 2 is on the right. Humane’s image quality is worse than a cheap 1960s B&amp;W TV (see the series of pictures below).  </p>



<p>Humane’s website and other promotional material have a series of <strong>fake still images </strong>(“Photoshopped” images overlayed on hands). While even these pictures are pretty low-resolution (much less than a true 720p image), they turn out to be much better than what is seen in the videos of the Humane projector. I fear that AI will soon make it easy to make fake images and videos that are less obvious, but these fakes from Humane did not use its “AI” technology. </p>

<p>The images below are still frames from the Humane Introduction Video, “<a href="https://youtu.be/9lNIwOOMVHk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This is the Humane Ai Pin</a>.” In addition to the lower resolution and contrast than the fake stills above. Notice how the crevices in the skin break up the image and don’t just darken it. In the the third from the left still below, the hand has been turned upward, catching more light (but nothing compared to a bright room or sunlight); notice how the image looks even more faded due to the ambient light.</p>

<p>The second set of video stills is from a <a href="https://twitter.com/realanders404/status/1726943119109722120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demonstration by Bethany Bongiorno</a>, Humane Cofounder. These videos were taken in a much darker environment, so the contrast of the projection is better. I want to see a demo in daylight (not in the shade). This video also shows how awkward it is to use your hand as a display screen and a controller and how the hand blocks the image. </p>

<h3>But, but, but, it is all about voice recognition and speech.</h3>



<p>Voice recognition has been on smartphones for about a decade with Siri (2011) and Alexa (2014). People have all experienced the good and bad of voice input and output. Certainly, voice can be a good adjunct input, but it can also be very frustrating and difficult to correct when it does not understand you correctly. AI will likely improve the recognition, but it will not be perfect. In many situations, voice input is insecure, disruptive, and/or impractical (due to, say, noise or wind). What is one supposed to do with the Humane device in such situations? </p>



<p>Humane’s <a href="https://youtu.be/9lNIwOOMVHk">introduction video</a> was a fiasco in that it highlighted the combined voice and image recognition problems. The founders looked stilted, trying to time everything and speaking slowly with preplanned questions to the “AI engine,” and sometimes the device gave erroneous answers. When asked about the best place to see the next solar eclipse, it gave a location too far south, and when asked to estimate how much protein is in a small number of almonds, it said that “half a cup has 15 grams.” A spokesperson for Humane has responded that it got the date correct on the eclipse but that the location was a “bug” and that while the “AI” missed the question’s intent on the almonds, the answer was technically correct on the grams per cup. </p>



<p>The AI answered like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Clavin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cliff Clavin</a> (bar know-it-all from the TV series Cheers who constantly gave erroneous information but showed full confidence in what he was saying – <a href="https://youtu.be/k6GTZrcoWEM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">example, video clip</a>). Apple uses “Siri” to trigger their audio response; maybe Humane could use “Cliff.” </p>

<p>Just for fun, I asked my iPhone’s Siri, “Where is the best place to watch the next solar eclipse?” and it came back with a series of links to articles (that included color pictures and maps) that I could scroll through on my phone but would never be able to read on Humane’s terrible display or would want read back to me. </p>



<p>In the real world, speech recognition is much more complex than Humane’s simplistic examples. The environment is going to be more complex and often noisy. When speaking, people are not careful to say each word clearly, particularly when they have to whisper to avoid disturbing the people around them too much. As has been widely discussed, AI will often answer questions with wrong information. </p>



<h2>Old Scam with Slightly New Twist</h2>



<p>Back in the days before Streaming, DVDs, and VHS tapes, the Disney company found they could rerelease their animated features every seven years, and a new generation of kids would think they were new. Disney then followed a similar pattern and put their VHS and later DVD releases in the “Disney Vault” between rereleases.</p>



<p>This pattern of letting memories fade away before reintroducing them as “new” also holds in high-tech. In 2016, this blog wrote about eyeHand in <a href="https://kguttag.com/2016/10/05/wrist-projector-scams-ritot-cicret-the-new-eyehand/">Wrist Projector Scams – Ritot, Cicret, the new eyeHand</a>. These companies showed some comically bad fake images that included “projecting black,” violating all laws of physics. </p>

<p>The scams by the small companies got big companies like Dell and Hilton to buy into the scammer’s marketing hype, and they released several “concept videos” seemingly based on these scams (see below from that <a href="https://kguttag.com/2016/10/05/wrist-projector-scams-ritot-cicret-the-new-eyehand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">same article</a>).</p>

<p>In 2018, Haier and ASU revisited the concept (see <a href="https://kguttag.com/2018/02/17/2018-ces-haier-laser-projector-watch-wrist-projector-scams-revisited/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the 2018 CES Haier Laser Projector Watch – (Wrist Projector Scams Revisited)</a>).

<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>Once you get past the contrived demonstrations and crappy displays, Humane’s problem is convincing real people that what they have is better than a smartphone. A modern smartphone has a better onboard processor and, orders of magnitude, a better display, supports audio and video input, and can communicate with the internet for AI or related speech recognition and answers. A phone does not force one to wear clothes that will be able to support it or make me hold my hand out to see a crappy image. </p>



<p>Few will believe a startup company has better speech recognition and information database technology than Google, Apple, Microsoft, and other giant companies. If Humane really had better technology, why didn’t they release it as a software application rather than developing this terrible device? </p>



<p>Humane has no advantages and massive disadvantages compared to a smartphone, and it seems most people in technology have come to the same conclusion based on my reading of the responses. There are a few “everyone gets a trophy” and “anything is possible” people who have an open (or empty?) mind to this concept. </p>



<p>How so many business people could get their companies to fork over a combined $230M confounds me. I’m waiting for the AI program that can explain it . . . Not really; it is probably a combination of ego, unwillingness to do good due diligence, and fear of missing out (FOMO), all very human problems. These same “businesspeople” will run most startups through the wringer for a few million in VC money and then hold a cash bonfire with Humane AI and Magic Leap (<a href="https://kguttag.com/2020/05/03/magic-leap-starts-to-auger-in-with-3-7x-the-money-as-theranos-i-tried-to-warn-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another company that originally told investors that a key technology was laser projection</a>). Thankfully, at least this time, they are not stealing money from individuals on Kickstarter or Indigogo like Ritot, Cicret, and eyeHand did, even if the amount is two orders of magnitude higher. </p>

One of the clear signals from the studies that we've done and a lot of other people have done over the past several years is that&nbsp;clearly in some people it can provoke inflammatory reactions in the brain or neuroinflammation and that may explain some of the symptoms that are&nbsp;experienced by some individuals.</p><div dir="ltr"><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A hand points to brain scans." srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.7172530.1712952480!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/shutterstock-medium-file.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7172530.1712952480!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/shutterstock-medium-file.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7172530.1712952480!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/shutterstock-medium-file.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7172530.1712952480!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/shutterstock-medium-file.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7172530.1712952480!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/shutterstock-medium-file.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.7172530.1712952480!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/shutterstock-medium-file.jpg" data-cy="image-img"></p><figcaption>In one study, researchers found that the protective blood-brain barrier was leaky after a COVID infection, which could drive changes in neural function.<!-- --> <!-- -->(sfam_photo / Shutterstock)</figcaption></figure></div><p dir="ltr">It can affect multiple substances on which the brain really depends to function normally. One of them is cortisol. So <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06651-y#:~:" target="_blank">people have studied this out of Yale University</a> and have shown that people with long COVID or people after SARS-CoV-2 infection can experience inappropriately low level of cortisol and that's actually an important hormone&nbsp;for a lot of certain normal physiologic processes, including cognitive performance, and a lower cortisol level than where it should be can explain some of the cognitive dysfunction&nbsp;that is seen in some people after SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are some studies also done on <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2811556" target="_blank">showing low serotonin levels</a>&nbsp;and that can also explain some of the symptoms.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>But doesn't the brain have a protective mechanism, the so-called blood brain barrier?&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">By inducing that inflammation of the brain, that actually&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01576-9" target="_blank">makes that barrier leaky</a>, so it starts leaking things into the brain that shouldn't be there. And things from the brain to outside the brain that also should not exit outside the brain. So a leaky blood brain barrier can also explain, you know, some of the manifestations that we see after COVID-19 infection.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How is this changing over time as the virus mutates?&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We're in a different phase of the pandemic now than what we all experienced in March 2020. We have a different virus. We have availability of vaccines now. We have antivirals. So all of these drivers&nbsp;have now sort of reduced overall the burden of long COVID.</p><div dir="ltr"><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Woman rests her hands on handle bars of an exercise bike used to strengthen muscle tone for fatigue after COVID-19." srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.6974405.1695325434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/long-covid.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6974405.1695325434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/long-covid.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6974405.1695325434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/long-covid.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6974405.1695325434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/long-covid.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6974405.1695325434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/long-covid.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.6974405.1695325434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/long-covid.jpg" data-cy="image-img"></p><figcaption>A woman rides on an exercise bike to strengthen muscle tone for fatigue related to long COVID at the Department of Rehabilitative Cardiology in Genoa, Italy.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div><p dir="ltr">That doesn't mean that SARS-CoV-2 infection is benign, is inconsequential. We still see people in the hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we still see people with strokes and heart attacks and, you know, brain fog and all other manifestations. But overall, I think the risk has sort of declined over the course of the pandemic.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How unique are these other effects on the body and the brain and the heart to COVID?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The big revelation or the big aha moment in this pandemic was the realization that SARS-CoV-2 infection can produce this really large basket of long-term adverse health effects. When we went back and started thinking about what happened to people after the Spanish flu, we found historical accounts that sort of resemble, to a large degree, what we described now after SARS-CoV-2 infection, people having increased risk of Parkinson's disease, headaches, brain fog etcetera.</p><p dir="ltr">I think one of the major lessons that I learned from this pandemic is that there are long tails to pandemics. And yes, we can focus all we want on the acute phase, or the tip of the iceberg, but the reality is that there is a really much larger chunk of disability and disease beneath that tip of the iceberg.</p><hr><p><em>Q&amp;A edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div><div><h2>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h2><div><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.7103151.1706893380!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/square_300/amanda-buckiewicz-headshot.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7103151.1706893380!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/square_460/amanda-buckiewicz-headshot.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7103151.1706893380!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/square_620/amanda-buckiewicz-headshot.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 258pxpx) 258pxpx" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.7103151.1706893380!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/square_620/amanda-buckiewicz-headshot.jpg" data-cy="author-image-img"></p></figure></div><p>Amanda Buckiewicz is an award-winning science journalist with CBC Radio's legendary science show, Quirks &amp; Quarks.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’re thrilled to announce that <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/ssh">Tailscale SSH</a> is now Generally Available. Tailscale SSH allows Tailscale to manage the authentication and authorization of SSH connections on your tailnet. From the user’s perspective, you use SSH as normal—authenticating with Tailscale according to configurable rules—and we handle SSO, MFA, and key rotation, and allow you to enforce precise permissions in ACLs. Combined with other enterprise features like user and group provisioning with SCIM, you can use Tailscale SSH to craft a fully zero-trust remote access solution.</p><p>Thanks to that flexibility and strong security-by-default, Tailscale SSH has already become a key component of many of our users’ workflows, including as a foundational piece of enterprise ZTNA strategies. With no additional hardware or firewall rules to manage, it’s basically a drop-in upgrade for ubiquitous—and sometimes somewhat fiddly—SSH processes.</p><p>We’ve got more conceptual background on how Tailscale SSH works, and what motivated us to release it, in <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/blog/tailscale-ssh">its original launch post</a>. You may also be interested in the tutorial video we recently published as part of our Tailscale Explained video series:</p><p>We’ve learned a lot from the Beta period of Tailscale SSH, and built up features alongside it, so today it’s entering a much more robust ecosystem of tooling than when we first launched in 2022. Some highlights include:</p><ul><li>We released the Tailscale SSH Console, allowing designated users to create browser-based SSH sessions to nodes on their tailnet</li><li>We added support for remote port forwarding and SELinux</li><li>We launched <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1246/tailscale-ssh-session-recording">session recording for Tailscale SSH</a>, enabling teams to meet compliance requirements and monitor SSH sessions across their tailnet without needing to trust a third party with their session data—including us.</li><li>We built our <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tailscale.vscode-tailscale">VS Code extension</a>, which allows you to edit remote files on nodes across your tailnet, on top of Tailscale SSH</li></ul><p>If you’re already using SSH for remote access, but haven’t yet gotten started with Tailscale SSH, <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1193/tailscale-ssh">there’s no time like the present</a>. It is available today on our Personal, Premium, and Enterprise plans.</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <p>12 Apr 2024</p>
  <p>As a query optimization researcher, I’ve spent the last 10 years of my life playing with, learning from, and building on top of the most sophisticated open source query optimizer out there, <a href="https://postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>. I recently wondered how much PostgreSQL had improved over the decade since I started working on databases. While changelogs and opinion pieces were plentiful, I couldn’t find any strong empirical comparisons, so I decided to run the <a href="https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol9/p204-leis.pdf">join order benchmark</a> (JOB)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> on PostgreSQL 8 through 16. I recorded the 90th percentile query latency for each database version.</p>

<p><img src="https://rmarcus.info/blog/assets/pg_over_time/job.svg" alt="Graph of P90 tail latency for different PostgreSQL versions. Speed improves drastically over time."></p>

<p>I built each version<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> of PostgreSQL using GCC 13.2 inside a Docker container with Arch Linux. Since I wanted to measure the quality of the query optimizer, and not index/IO performance, I set <code>shared_buffers</code> to 8GB (large enough to hold the entire database). I also set <code>work_mem</code> to 8MB for all versions. Each query is executed once to warm the cache, then the median latency of 5 additional runs in recorded.</p>

<p>Overall, <strong>PostgreSQL’s tail performance has improved drastically</strong>, although versions 13 through 16 have been mostly stable. Comparing version 8 to version 16, <strong>PostgreSQL’s optimizer has dropped tail latency by nearly half in the last 10 years!</strong></p>

<p>We can also investigate the entire query distribution (note the log scale):</p>

<p><img src="https://rmarcus.info/blog/assets/pg_over_time/box.svg" alt="Box plots of query latency for each major version. There is a slight slope downwards."></p>

<p>We can use regression analysis to (1) confirm that the downward slope in latency is significant, and (2) quantify how much improvement is brought by each version of PostgreSQL. If we regress the PostgreSQL major version number against query latency, we see that each new major version of PostgreSQL brings, on average, a <strong>15% performance improvement</strong> on the Join Order Benchmark (<span id="il180"></span>). However, a linear model is arguably a poor measure of the change (<span id="il181"></span>).</p>

<p>Of course, not all of these improvements are attributable to the query optimizer. Improvements to the execution engine – from parallel workers to just-in-time (JIT) compilation – also play a role. It would be interesting to investigate how each query plan in JOB has changed over the year… maybe next time!</p>

<p>Quantifying the improvement aside:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Upgrade your database! Going from PostgreSQL 8 to 16 has the potential to massively improve your workload’s tail latency.</li>
  <li>Researchers should note that PostgreSQL is a bit of a moving target. Learned query optimization research has compared with different versions of PostgreSQL over time (e.g., Neo and Bao compare with version 11, whereas newer work compare with version 14, 15, or 16.) So just because an older technique improves on PostgreSQL by 30%, and a newer technique only improves on PostgreSQL by 25%, the newer technique may be comparing against a stronger PostgreSQL.</li>
</ul>

      <p>Advice for myself around leisure activities.</p>
      <p>You aren’t famous. Anything you do or create will probably receive little to no attention, so stop optimizing for a non-existent audience and instead focus on what makes you enjoy the activity. </p>
      <p>Want to try a craft or artistic hobby? Focus on mastering the skill and enjoy the variety it can provide. You don’t need to build a personal style. No one will care. Want to do photography and think black and white photos are cool? Great! You don’t need to create an Instagram branded all around your moody black and white photos. Most likely you’ll get bored of it and want to try a different type of photography, and that’s great. You aren’t Ansel Adams, no one will care if your “style” is all over the place.</p>
      <p>Do you want to build an app or website but don’t enjoy the process of designing? Then make it ugly. Who cares! Design is for an audience and you don’t have one. Functionality is more important right now. Maybe a designer will notice and want to improve it for you, but until then take pride in your crappy UI. </p>
      <p>Blogging is fun and therapeutic. Grammar and editing aren’t. As long as your thoughts are coherent, don’t worry too much about writing mistakes or filtering yourself. Just use Grammarly to fix elementary-level errors and move on. It’s more about the writing process than the final product.</p>
      <p>The most egregious thing you can do with any activity is daydream about how you can make money off of it. That’s the quickest way to optimize for the wrong things and suck the fun right out of it. Most likely you will stop doing the activity almost immediately, so save the money-making schemes for work.</p>
      <p>In the end, find something you enjoy doing and just do it because you enjoy it. If you have to, make some goals for yourself, but never for your “audience”.</p>

		<p>Anniversaries are strange: no one but those involved have any reason to even know they exist, which makes them easy to skip; for example, last year I mostly ignored the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/welcome-to-stratechery/">10 year anniversary of starting Stratechery</a> because I was more eager to write about <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/chatgpt-learns-computing/">ChatGPT Getting a Computer</a>. That leaves today, April 16, as my last chance to mark a tin anniversary: ten years ago Stratechery <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/welcome-stratechery-20/">added a subscription option</a>, making this my full-time job.</p>
<p>It was, for the record, a miserable day: I had a convoluted plan to offer different site experiences for subscribers and non-subscribers: the former would receive daily linked-list updates (a la <a href="https://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a>) while the latter would still have access to longer-form Articles; I scrapped the concept <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/free-stratechery-daily-email/">two days later</a> in favor of simply sending subscribers a daily email, and so the paid newsletter model was born.</p>
<p>That accident of history ended up being why this anniversary is actually more meaningful to me: while I am most well-known for Stratechery, I am equally proud of the paid newsletter model — services like Substack <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/platforms/platform-profiles/substack-newsletter-platform/">were based on Stratechery</a> — and gratified that so many writers are making a living connecting directly with readers.</p>
<p>Of course newsletters aren’t the only medium where this happens (and, in fact, I’ve never viewed Stratechery as a newsletter; it’s a blog that you can read via email); there are also podcasts (which <a href="https://stratechery.com/stratechery-plus/">Stratechery has expanded into</a>) and YouTube (like and subscribe to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Stratechery">Stratechery</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SharpTechPodcast">Sharp Tech</a> channels!). The king of the latter, at least when it comes to tech, is Marques Brownlee, aka <a href="https://twitter.com/mkbhd">MKBHD</a>.</p>
<h3>The Humane AI Pin</h3>
<p>Humane introduced the wearable AI Pin at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMsQO5u7-NQ">a TED Talk 11 months ago</a>,  painting the vision of a future without screens, powered by AI. I was, for the record, pretty skeptical: most new tech categories layer on top of what came before, as opposed to outright replacing them; Humane’s proposal of a wearable device that was completely independent of the phone in your pocket seemed unlikely to succeed. Still, I was cheering for them: I applaud any company trying to build something new, and AI provides the opening for new experimentation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, last week the reviews of the AI Pin came out and they were universally terrible; The Verge’s headline summed up the sentiment: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126502/humane-ai-pin-review">Humane AI Pin review: not even close</a>. David Pierce wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I came into this review with two big questions about the AI Pin. The first is the big-picture one: is this thing… anything? In just shy of two weeks of testing, I’ve come to realize that there are, in fact, a lot of things for which my phone actually sucks. Often, all I want to do is check the time or write something down or text my wife, and I end up sucked in by TikTok or my email or whatever unwanted notification is sitting there on my screen. Plus, have you ever thought about how often your hands are occupied with groceries / clothes / leashes / children / steering wheels, and how annoying / unsafe it is to try to balance your phone at the same time? I’ve learned I do lots of things on my phone that I might like to do somewhere else. So, yeah, this is something. Maybe something big. AI models aren’t good enough to handle everything yet, but I’ve seen enough glimmers of what’s coming that I’m optimistic about the future.</p>
<p>  That raises the second question: should you buy this thing? That one’s easy. Nope. Nuh-uh. No way. The AI Pin is an interesting idea that is so thoroughly unfinished and so totally broken in so many unacceptable ways that I can’t think of anyone to whom I’d recommend spending the $699 for the device and the $24 monthly subscription.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Brownlee agreed; he said at the start of his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TitZV6k8zfA&amp;t=18s">YouTube review</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>
  So this is the Humane AI Pin. It is a brand new product in a really interesting new form factor of an ultra-futuristic wearable computer. In a time of all these crazy gadgets and Vision Pro and wearable glasses, it’s so sick that we get so many genuinely new first generation products like this to give a shot.</p>
<p>  Unfortunately it’s also the new worst product I think I’ve ever reviewed in its current state. There’s just so many things bad about it. It’s so bad, in fact, that I actually think it’s kind of distracting to understand what the point of the device is as we go through it, so I’m going to have to separate it out for this video. First, I’m going to tell you what it is and what it’s supposed to do, and then I’ll tell you what my experience has actually been using it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Brownlee proceeded to do just that: he presented Humane’s vision, detailed how poorly it lived up to it (including the probably fatal flaw inherent in its decision to pretend smartphones don’t exist), and granted that future software updates might improve the experience. I thought it was a fair,<sup id="rf1-12783"><a href="#fn1-12783" title="Actually, the deference Brownlee gave the vision and the potential of future upgrades was arguably generous" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> if brutal, review, but what had some people up in arms was the title and thumbnail:</p>
<div>
<blockquote data-dnt="true">

</div>
<p>I don’t tweet much these days — if you want one of my tips for lasting over a decade, that is one of them, for my own peace of mind more than anything —&nbsp;but Vassallo’s sentiment bothered me enough to fire off a response:</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>I honestly think I had this anniversary on my mind: I remember when I first started, with only a few hundred followers on Twitter, armed with nothing but my honest takes about tech; my only hope was that those takes would be original enough and valuable enough to build an audience. That they were didn’t diminish the desire to be honest; indeed, one of the biggest challenges creators face as they grow is retaining their edge even when they know people are actually paying attention to what they have to say.</p>
<h3>MKBHD’s Responsibility</h3>
<p>The more interesting Vassallo tweet, though, and the one that inspired this Article, was this exchange in response to his original tweet:</p>
<div>
<blockquote data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">MKBHD is not the market. He *significantly* influences the market.</p>
<p>If a single person can affect the stock price of a company, we usually restrict what they can say or when. MK should be cognizant of the unconstrained power he has (for now).</p>
<p>— Daniel Vassallo (@dvassallo) <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1779785621760069810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Ignore the vaguely threatening “for now” ; Vassallo is touching on something profound about Brownlee, that I myself understand intimately: what the Internet has made uniquely possible is total loyalty to your customers, and that is threatening.</p>
<p>Let me start with myself: every dollar of income I have comes from my subscribers,<sup id="rf2-12783"><a href="#fn2-12783" title="I previously spoke for pay, and even more previously offered consulting, and even more previously than that had ads; however, I ended ads in 2014, consulting in 2015, and haven’t accepted any paid speaking opportunities since 2017. This is all covered on <a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/about/&quot;>my about page</a>." rel="footnote">2</a></sup> all of whom pay the same price.<sup id="rf3-12783"><a href="#fn3-12783" title="$12/month or $120/year for the last five years, increasing to $15/month and $150/year on April 22" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> If someone doesn’t like what I write, I make it easy to unsubscribe; if they accuse me of writing for favor or illegitimate profit I am happy to unsubscribe them myself, and refund their money. After all, to use Brownlee’s reponse to Vassallo:</p>
<div>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We disagree on what my job is</p>
<p>— Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) <a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1779928058746617912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>My job is to make my subscribers happy, and the best way I’ve found to do that is to stay as true as I can to what I set out to do in the beginning: write things that are original and valuable. When I succeed I’m happy, and the numbers take care of themselves; when I publish something I’m not happy with, I have trouble sleeping. When tech companies or investors or anyone else is mad, I am free to not pay them any attention.</p>
<p>Brownlee, though, is, to Vassallo’s point, something else entirely: 18 million subscribers is an incredible number, even if only — “only” — 3.5 million people have viewed his Humane video. If Humane’s AI Pin wasn’t already dead in the water, it’s fair to say that <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1779842724771893524">@levelsio</a> is right:</p>

<p>Who, though, is to blame, and who benefited? Surely the responsibility for the Humane AI Pin lies with Humane; the people who benefited from Brownlee’s honesty were his viewers, the only people to whom Brownlee owes anything. To think of this review — or even just the title — as “distasteful” or “unethical” is to view Humane — a recognizable entity, to be sure — as of more worth than the 3.5 million individuals who watched Brownlee’s review.</p>
<p>This is one of the challenges of scale: Brownlee has so many viewers that it is almost easier to pretend like they are some unimportant blob. Brownlee, though, is successful because he remembers his job is not to go easy on individual companies, but inform individual viewers who will make individual decisions about spending $700 on a product that doesn’t work. Thanks to the Internet he has absolutely no responsibility or incentive to do anything but.</p>
<h3>Media and the Internet</h3>
<p>While Stratechery mostly covers tech, I also spend a lot of time on media; in the early days of Stratechery, this mostly meant newspapers, and my argument was that was in fact a particularly useful angle on the impact of technology broadly: the fact that newspapers were text meant that they felt the impact of the Internet almost immediately, effects that would, as devices became more powerful and ubiquitous, and broadband faster and more reliable, impact everything. And, of course, Stratechery was a written product, so I had a stake in the game.</p>
<p>To that end, I wrote a series of Articles in the run-up to April 16, 2014, laying the groundwork for why I thought my subscription offering would work. The last of these was entitled <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/newspapers-are-dead-long-live-journalism/">Newspapers Are Dead; Long Live Journalism</a>, where I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Remember how the New York Times was started as&nbsp;<a href="http://archive.org/stream/historyofnewyork00davi/historyofnewyork00davi_djvu.txt">a means of making money</a>? After the first year the paper had a circulation of 26,000 in a city of over half a million, but had incurred up-front capital costs of $50,000, and first-year expenses of $78,000 (In 1851 dollars; the modern equivalent would be $1.4 million and $2.2 million respectively). Compare that to this blog (which, by happy coincidence, turns&nbsp;<a href="http://stratechery.com/2013/welcome-to-stratechery/">one year old</a>&nbsp;tomorrow, making this comparison timely):&nbsp;<a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/fivethirtyeight-end-average/">FiveThirtyEight and the End of Average</a>, the first article in this series, has been read by over 30,000 people; meanwhile, I’ve spent less than $2,000. More readers, way less money.</p>
<p>  You may consider the comparison unfair — an entire newsroom putting out a daily edition as compared to a solo blogger posting one Article — but&nbsp;<em>the unfairness is the point</em>. No one shared my article because it was from Stratechery, but then again, no one shares an article today just because it’s from the New York Times; all that matters is the individual article and its worth to the reader and potential sharer. As a writer,&nbsp;<em>this is amazing.</em>&nbsp;When it comes to reader attention, I am competing on an equal footing with The New York Freaking Times! Unfortunately for The New York Times, when it comes to making money they’re competing with Google and Facebook. Most distressingly, though, when it comes to costs, they’re competing with the last 150 years. Everything from printing presses to sales and marketing is deadweight if advertising is not a sustainable model.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The New York Times has, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/the-new-york-times-ai-opportunity/">to its immense credit</a>, figured out how to go direct to readers; most other newspapers have <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/the-local-news-business-model/">struggled</a>: cost structures that were predicated on owning printing presses and delivery trucks simply don’t make sense in a world where <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/economic-power-age-abundance/">distribution is free</a>.</p>
<p>Free distribution, meanwhile, made Stratechery possible: I just needed to write compelling content on my own website. Brownlee, meanwhile, got his free distribution from YouTube (and, to the extent you want to complain about his accurate but attention-grabbing headline, the realities of the YouTube algorithm, the one non-viewer incentive Brownlee needs to respond to, looms large). The key point is that he could do everything else on his own, starting with the webcam on his HP Pavilion laptop that he used to record <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gk_rl3y_SU">his first video</a>:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9gk_rl3y_SU?si=hlgLhuPF1LAqLXUw&amp;controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Today Brownlee has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jz_qFyTrS8w">top-of-the-line studio</a> and a staff, but the fundamental principle remains: in media one person can do it all, and build a thriving business that makes everyone from Humane to Apple care deeply about what he or she has to say — far more than they care about any traditional publication.</p>
<h3>AI and Intelligence</h3>
<p>I mentioned at the beginning that last year I wrote about <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/chatgpt-learns-computing/">ChatGPT Gets a Computer</a> in lieu of an anniversary post; that Article, which was built around OpenAI’s announcement of (now-discontinued) ChatGPT plugins, was about the nature of the brain and how large learning models did or did not compare.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Computers are deterministic: if circuit X is open, then the proposition represented by X is true; 1 plus 1 is always 2; clicking “back” on your browser will exit this page. There are, of course, a huge number of abstractions and massive amounts of logic between an individual transistor and any action we might take with a computer — and an effectively infinite number of places for bugs — but the appropriate mental model for a computer is that they do exactly what they are told (indeed, a bug is not the computer making a mistake, but rather a manifestation of the programmer telling the computer to do the wrong thing).</p>
<p>  I’ve already mentioned Bing Chat and ChatGPT; on March 14 Anthropic released another AI assistant named Claude: while the announcement doesn’t say so explicitly, I assume the name is in honor of the aforementioned Claude Shannon. This is certainly a noble sentiment — Shannon’s contributions to information theory broadly extend far beyond what Dixon laid out above — but it also feels misplaced: while technically speaking everything an AI assistant is doing is ultimately composed of 1s and 0s, the manner in which they operate is emergent from their training, not proscribed, which leads to the experience feeling fundamentally different from logical computers — something nearly human — which takes us back to hallucinations; Sydney was interesting, but what about homework?
</p></blockquote>
<p>I added in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/chatgpt-enterprise-connectors-and-small-businesses-nvidia-competitors/">an August Update</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The point of that Article was that ChatGPT’s plugin architecture gave hallucinating creative LLMs access to determinative computers to ascertain truth, not dissimilar to the way a creative being like you or I might use a calculator to solve a math problem. In other words, the LLM is the interface to the source of truth, not the source of truth itself.</p>
<p>  That is exactly what this “coming soon” feature is all about: you don’t make an LLM useful for your business by adding your business’s data to the LLM; that is simply a bit more text in a sea of it. Rather, you leverage the LLM as an interface to “computers” that deterministically give you the right answer. In this case, those computers will be “connecting the applications you already have”, which sounds to me an awful lot like enterprise-specific plug-ins.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The specifics of product implementations are not the point, but rather the distinction between a natural language interface based on probabilities and computers based on deterministic calculations; I think using the former to access the latter will remain one of the most important applications of large language models.</p>
<p>There is, though, one more piece: who actually tells the AI what to do, such that it needs access to a computer of its own? In <em>ChatGPT Gets a Computer</em>, which analogized large language models to Jeff Hawkin’s theory of the brain, I expressed hope that the beliefs he expressed about the nature of intelligence in <a href="https://www.numenta.com/resources/books/a-thousand-brains-by-jeff-hawkins/">A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence</a> extended to large language models. Hawkins writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Intelligence is the ability of a system to learn a model of the world. However, the resulting model by itself is valueless, emotionless, and has no goals. Goals and values are provided by whatever system is using the model. It’s similar to how the explorers of the sixteenth through the twentieth centuries worked to create an accurate map of Earth. A ruthless military general might use the map to plan the best way to surround and murder an opposing army. A trader could use the exact same map to peacefully exchange goods. The map itself does not dictate these uses, nor does it impart any value to how it is used. It is just a map, neither murderous nor peaceful. Of course, maps vary in detail and in what they cover. Therefore, some maps might be better for war and others better for trade. But the desire to wage war or trade comes from the person using the map.</p>
<p>  Similarly, the neocortex learns a model of the world, which by itself has no goals or values. The emotions that direct our behaviors are determined by the old brain. If one human’s old brain is aggressive, then it will use the model in the neocortex to better execute aggressive behavior. If another person’s old brain is benevolent, then it will use the model in the neocortex to better achieve its benevolent goals. As with maps, one person’s model of the world might be better suited for a particular set of aims, but the neocortex does not create the goals.
</p></blockquote>
<p>To the extent this is an analogy to AI, large language models are intelligent, but they do not have goals or values or drive. They are tools to be used by, well, anyone who is willing and able to take the initiative to use them.</p>
<h3>AI and the Sovereign Individual</h3>
<p>I don’t think either Brownlee or I particularly need AI, or, to put it another way, are overly threatened by it. Yes, ChatGPT would have written several thousands words far more quickly than the hours it took me to write this Article, but I am (perhaps foolishly) confident that they would not be original and valuable enough to take away my audience; I think it’s the same for Brownlee.</p>
<p>The connection between us and AI, though, is precisely the fact that we haven’t needed it: the nature of media is such that we could already create text and video on our own, and take advantage of the Internet to — at least in the case of Brownlee — deliver finishing blows to $230 million startups.</p>
<p>How many industries, though, are not media, in that they still need a team to implement the vision of one person? How many apps or services are there that haven’t been built, not because one person can’t imagine them or create them in their mind, but because they haven’t had the resources or team or coordination capabilities to actually ship them?</p>
<p>This gets at the vector through which AI impacts the world above and beyond cost savings in customer support, or whatever other obvious low-hanging fruit there may be: as the ability of large language models to understand and execute complex commands — with deterministic computing as needed — increases, so too does the potential power of the sovereign individual telling AI what to do. The Internet removed the necessity — and inherent defensibility — of complex cost structures for media; AI has the potential to do the same for a far greater host of industries.</p>
<hr>
<p>Brownlee’s 2nd most popular video is only two months old: it’s his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak">overview of the Apple Vision Pro</a>; it’s not, if fiction is our guide, an accident that Meta is developing the Quest and Apple has released the Vision Pro just as AI seems poised to threaten an ever-increasing number of jobs. This was the world painted by Pixar’s Wall-E:</p>

<p>It’s funny, because before I looked up this photo, I could have sworn the humans in the film, lulled to insouciance by an AI that addressed all of their physical needs, were wearing headsets; I guess Pixar overestimated our ability to build space-faring cruise ships and underestimated the relentless progression of consumer electronics.</p>
<p>My suspicion, however, is that Pixar got it wrong, and this famous photo of Mark Zuckerberg at Mobile World Congress in 2016 is closer to the truth of the matter.</p>

<p>Wall-E erred by assuming that every human was the same, all gleefully enslaved by AUTO, the ships AI. In fact, though, I suspect humanity will be distributed bi-modally, with the vast majority of people happily wearing their Vision Pros or watching their streaming service or viewing their TikTok videos, while increasingly sovereign individuals, aided by AI, pilot the ship.</p>
<p>That may sound extreme, but again, this is why it is useful to look to media first: Brownlee — one man, who started out by reviewing a media center remote on his HP laptop — does in fact hold the fate of entire companies and products in his hand. My bet is not that AI replaces Brownlee, but that AI means Brownlee’s for everything, not just media.</p>
<p>As for me, I plan on documenting it every step of the way, thanks to every person who has supported Stratechery over the last 10 years, and to whom I alone owe accountability, and gratitude.</p>

                         <p>
            April 15th, 2024</p><!-- .entry-meta -->
        <p>Every so often, somebody rediscovers my story of <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050824-11/?p=34463"> buying an entire Egghead Software store</a>. One question that comes up is the issue of taxes. (You can never avoid taxes. Taxes are due today for most people in the United States.)</p>
<p>If the employees were allowed to keep the software provided they tested the program and filed bugs against it, did that count as work compensation that became taxable income?</p>
<p>The thing is, nobody ever checked whether you tested the program you took, and it was obvious to everybody participating in the activity, seeing as you just picked up the software and walked out of the room without filling out any paperwork. You were assumed to be a well-meaning member of the team who wouldn’t show up for an activity without any intention of doing it. The expectation that you test the program was just that: An expectation. It wasn’t a condition.</p>
<p>My understanding is that this makes the software count as a gift that falls under the <i>de minimis</i> rule of the United States tax code. This was a one-time thing, so the frequency criterion is met. The value of the software was well under $100, so that requirement was met. And since nobody actually kept track of who took which software, the administrative impracticality requirement was also satisfied.</p>
<p>But really, this was just a development manager taking it upon himself to do some unconventional application compatibility test coverage and to instill camaraderie at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: During one of the many iterations of this story being retold, someone remarked that they got a copy of the video game <i>Wing Commander III</i> through this exercise. I immediately remembered that they fulfilled their expectation by filing a bug against Windows 95: When you earned the cloaking device on level 58 or something, you couldn’t activate it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they provided a save-game at level 58, so I didn’t have to play all the way to level 58 by myself.</p>
<p>The problem was that the hotkey for activating the cloaking device was <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, and that conflicted with the use of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to cancel an active clipboard paste operation into an MS-DOS session. Normally, Windows 95 realized that there was no active paste active and replayed the hotkey into the MS-DOS session. However, the replay of the hotkey was apparently too fast for this game to recognize, so it never activated the cloaking device.</p>
<p>I fixed it by changing Windows 95 so that it installed the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> hotkey handler only when a clipboard paste operation was active, and removed it when the paste operation completed. That way, when you hit it outside of a paste operation, the keys were visible to the game at human speeds, and this allowed it to engage the cloaking device.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.maggieslepian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maggie Slepian</a> | Longreads | April 2, 2024 | 5,423 words</em></p>



<p>Spring in Montana is a season of waiting, trapped in a limbo of rotten snow and inaccessible trails. It makes me feel desperate: a rare warm day followed by another sleet storm, the high-octane days of summer still impossibly far away.</p>



<p>In May 2019, I was crawling out of my skin. The high-elevation north-facing trails were still sheets of ice and the south-facing trails were shoe-sucking mud. I was so sick of my gym routine that I’d sit in the parking lot for 20 minutes, willing myself to go inside.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’d moved to Montana from the northeast nearly a decade before, drawn to lofty mountains to reinvent my tame life in suburban New Hampshire. I immediately began compiling a résumé of outdoor activities: I learned to mountain bike, became a strong climber, checked peaks off my list, and worked as a horseback guide. Backcountry recreation was the social currency and my value hinged on accepting every invitation, so I did my best to learn everything.</p>



<p>But no matter how many skills I picked up, my struggles with asthma meant I often fell behind. I was the last one to the top of the switchbacks, watching my lean, muscled friends vanish over the ridge as I sucked air through a windpipe that felt like a crumpled straw.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I made up for those cardio challenges with an uncanny ability to reject fear. I volunteered to go first on intimidating climbing routes, humming to stay calm as I gripped miniscule edges and pressed my feet against glassy slabs of rock. I fell often, once catching my leg behind the rope and flipping upside down, my head ringing as I smashed into the wall. My belayer called up in a panic and offered to lower me, but I was already pulling myself up the rope before I’d stopped swinging. My self-worth banked on being the most fearless, camping in winter storms, grabbing the reins of the horse who had thrown me, pulling pebbles out of my knees and joking about how hard I’d hit the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p>That frenetic activity level of summer and winter made spring’s dullness harder to bear. I craved movement in the backcountry and the social life that came with it. Kadin texted me one of those afternoons when I was flopping around the climbing gym mats delaying my workout. He was a climbing partner, decently good friend, river guide, and enough of an enigma that I wasn’t sure whether I had a crush or he just had enough mystique to seem appealing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He asked if I had a kayak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I responded right away. <em>Yeah, an old river runner. You looking to get out this week?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>My kayak was a 15-year-old Wave Sport Frankenstein I’d picked up at a pawn shop the year before. I’d spent that summer paddling the reservoir south of town, occasionally running a calm section of the Madison River. The boat was narrow and prone to tipping. I planned to take a roll clinic the following summer, as I was determined to gain aptitude in yet another outdoor sport—just enough to feel confident on beginner whitewater.</p>



<p>The section of the Gallatin River that Kadin wanted to run was near my house, easily accessible and less intimidating than anything in the canyon. Despite being an open section of water, it was still technically early-season conditions, ice cold and scattered with hazardous deadfall. I accepted the invitation immediately.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Despite being an open section of water, it was still technically early-season conditions, ice cold and scattered with hazardous deadfall. I accepted the invitation immediately.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>I didn’t consider whether or not I was comfortable paddling that stretch. Along with the desire to keep up with my peers, my ability to assess risk was skewed after years of narrow backcountry escapes, a well-documented phenomenon where your risk perception shifts after successfully navigating unpredictable situations. From outrunning lightning storms to losing the trail to tackling climbs well above my grade, I’d encountered plenty of tenuous scenarios and always figured it out, scraping by without too much damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="http://simonpriest.altervista.org/DOWNLOADS/ChangesPerceivedRCADVENTURE.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adventure Experience Paradigm</a> describes this well; it uses a simple line graphic to show the interplay of risk and competence. When the risk is low and the skills are high, the person is toward the bottom of the chart in the “realm of exploration and experimentation.” When competence and risk are balanced, the participant is in the middle, and when risk exceeds competence, the outcome can be catastrophic. The more experience someone has with navigating risky situations, the more confident they become, skewing the variables. My boating experience was minimal and that section of river was not for beginners, but I had scraped by enough times that my risk assessment was dangerously off-kilter. It was a really, really bad combination.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>My boating experience was minimal and that section of river was not for beginners, but I had scraped by enough times that my risk assessment was dangerously off-kilter. It was a really, really bad combination.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>None of this was on my mind a few days later as I grabbed my kayaking gloves and neoprene booties and dragged my boat out of the garage. I raked a finger through the cobwebs stretching across the seat as Kadin’s truck rumbled into my driveway. We crammed both boats in the bed of my truck, shuttled his truck to the takeout, and I drove us back to the start.</p>



<p>The wind was brisk as we unloaded the boats, whipping my hair against my face and pushing puffy white clouds across the sky. I inched down the embankment toward the blown-out river, swollen from snowmelt and moving faster than I thought. Icy water splashed my toes and I slipped in the slick mud.</p>



<p>“I’m glad I brought the booties,” I shouted over the water. Kadin gave me a thumbs up and tossed his spare spray skirt in my direction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The river at this time would have been around 40 degrees, frigid with snowmelt and choked with trees and other obstacles lodged in the current. These lodged obstacles, called “strainers,” make normally moderate sections extremely dangerous, allowing water through but not a boat. Getting pinned underwater against a wall of debris is just one of the ways you can die on a river. It didn’t occur to me to be scared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To a casual observer, the fact that I owned a boat and a few kayaking accessories gave the appearance I knew what I was doing. But technical boating is a far cry from my mellow paddling experience. I lacked the reflexes and skills to navigate faster water, plus my boat was outdated and difficult to stabilize. But the excitement of finally getting outside, the relative rarity of an invitation from Kadin, plus my other narrow escapes pushed out any seed of doubt. I lowered myself into my kayak.</p>



<p>Kadin’s spare spray skirt barely fit over the cockpit and I couldn’t get enough leverage to secure it. He crouched over my boat, wrestling with the neoprene until it strained across the opening.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Can you pull that off if you have to?” He secured his own spray skirt and pushed himself toward the water.</p>



<p>“I don’t know,” I answered honestly. “It’s kind of tight.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He paused. “Do you want to practice?”</p>



<p>His hesitancy annoyed me.</p>



<p>I knew I should make sure I could release it, but my brain raced through two scenarios: if I couldn’t pull the spray skirt, it would be clear we shouldn’t run this section—I’d be trapped underwater if I flipped my boat and couldn’t roll. But if I pulled it on shore and couldn’t put it back on, Kadin would have to help me again and I’d look silly and inexperienced. I shook my head and dug my paddle into the embankment.</p>



<p>“It’s fine, let’s go. I’m not going to flip my boat.”</p>



<p>My boat wasn’t cooperating the instant I dropped into the river. The water was too fast and&nbsp;unpredictable. Every time I tried to adjust course, I was buffeted by the current. I scolded myself to paddle like I knew how, but this wasn’t the type of kayaking I was used to—my reflexes were slow and instincts incorrect. My boat’s slim bow dipped and rose, and I flexed my legs against the thigh braces in an attempt to stabilize. An icy splash of water streamed down my jacket. I knew I shouldn’t be on the water.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>I knew I shouldn’t be on the water.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>I was desperate to be off the river but I also wasn’t in control. That realization turned into panic as I was catapulted forward in the current, glancing sidelong at the bank rushing by and knowing I didn’t have the skills to eddy out. Too much was happening too quickly. The spray skirt felt like a vise around my waist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A wave hit me in the face and I gasped, swiping a hand across my eyes as I heard Kadin yell behind me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Stay to the left! Maggie, the left!” he shouted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I turned to hear him better, and when I looked forward I had dropped into a trough and the current swept me to the right.</p>



<p>I blinked to clear water from my eyes and saw why Kadin had yelled to stay left. I was heading right toward a massive strainer, topped by a downed tree at head height. It was as thick as my torso, the gnarled root ball creating a dam for a jagged pile of broken logs.</p>



<p>I threw my arm out and collided with the tree with a sickening whack. Before I could take a breath, my boat flipped and I was underwater.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Oh no, </em>I thought. <em>I am in so much trouble.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>It was silent underwater, yellowish-green and brighter than I would have thought. Fist-sized rocks bouncing next to my head were the only indication of how fast I was moving.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>You’re moving, which means you’re not pinned against the strainer. Get air. You have to roll.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>I’d never practiced rolling a kayak—the roll clinic was still on my long list of goals—but I knew to snap my hips into the side of the boat and leverage with the paddle. My boat was built to roll, but I had no muscle memory to draw from to actually execute the move. I also had no paddle—it had been ripped from my hands when I hit the tree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I threw my hips into the side of my boat. It rocked a few inches, then settled back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I fought panic. <em>Try again</em>, <em>you need to get air.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>I threw my hips harder into the side of the boat. Nothing. The effort took energy and energy took oxygen. A countdown started in my head. I only had a few minutes to get out of the boat. How long had I been underwater?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Wet exit</em>. <em>Pull the spray skirt.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>I frantically felt for the grab loop, but I was upside down and disoriented. When I found it after wasting more precious seconds, I leaned back and pulled as hard as I could. It didn’t budge. More seconds went by. My heart started thudding more rapidly and I felt that familiar aching burn when you stay underwater too long.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A thought came into my head, momentarily paralyzing me: <em>these might be your last few minutes</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My clumsy gloved hands scrabbled uselessly at the edges of the neoprene trapping me in the boat. As I realized I couldn’t release the spray skirt that way either, panic, regret, and sorrow flooded my brain.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>As I realized I couldn’t release the spray skirt that way either, panic, regret, and sorrow flooded my brain.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p><em>Please no. Please don’t let it end like this.</em></p>



<p>This is where my brain split into two tracks running at the same time: a sadness track and an action track.</p>



<p>The sadness track focused on my family. My parents and three younger siblings all still lived in the Northeast. They supported me but didn’t understand my drive to keep pushing, and they continuously begged me to be careful. I thought about my mother, wracked with nerves whenever I’d casually recount another close call. I thought about my dad. His cancer had just relapsed; my family was already suffering. My drowning would destroy them.</p>



<p><em>I’m sorry.</em> <em>I’m so sorry for my family, I made a mistake and I wish I hadn’t come here and I’m sorry.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The action track said: <em>keep trying until it’s over.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>I smashed my hip into the side of my boat again, and this time I rocked it enough to hear the roar of the water and feel air on one side of my face. I sucked in a half-breath, half-mouthful-of-water before rolling under again, buying myself incrementally more time. I wondered if Kadin had seen me roll, if he knew what was happening.</p>



<p>My heart sped up even more and I felt a new sensation in my chest: a dark hole with a deep burn around the edges. Still being pulled downriver, I watched my hourglass run out as I tried one last time to roll, but I was too tired and barely moved the boat.</p>



<p>I knew then that I didn’t want my last few minutes to be full of sadness and regret. If I wasn’t going to survive this, I didn’t want my final thoughts to be berating myself for a bad choice.</p>



<p><em>It’s OK, </em>I thought<em>. You didn’t mean for this to happen. You are going to die and you should just be grateful for the time you had.</em></p>



<p>The heavy, black ache in my chest fully replaced the burn. I forced myself to keep my eyes open and watch the sunbeams like I’d seen a thousand times before, when I’d been underwater by choice and could come up for air when I wanted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My vision spotted and wavered. I thought about my family one more time, trying to send a message through the river and into the air I couldn’t reach: <em>I’m so sorry, I love you, I didn’t mean to hurt you.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>I read somewhere that we’re all unreliable narrators, even for our own stories. It’s impossible to remember fully accurate details and our brain fills the gaps where our memories fail.</p>

<p>This means I can’t tell you what order in which things happened: whether I felt Kadin collide with my boat or whether I was still unconscious when he dragged me to the surface. I just know I opened my eyes to the blue sky studded with clouds I thought I’d never see again, and that I felt the spring air whipping against my face. He told me I made a noise, a choking moan that sounded like a dying animal. He thought: <em>she still might not make it</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Things came into focus one at a time: Kadin’s arm across my chest, the bruising strike of his legs as he lifeguard-dragged me to an eddy, my head propped out of the water on his shoulder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once I fully came to, I thrashed away from him, swimming an adrenaline-fueled freestyle to the bank and digging my hands into the mud to pull myself out. I collapsed in a heap, threw up river water, tried to stand, fell down. Kadin leaned over me and pressed my shoulders down, his eyes darting over my face, his own hollow with fear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m OK, I’m fine.” My voice sounded like it was run through a grater. Once I started shivering, I couldn’t stop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Mags, I thought you were a goner.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What happened,” I asked, “how did you get to me?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He told it like this: he saw me collide with the strainer and flip my boat. He paddled after me as fast as possible, watching my upside-down kayak, waiting for me to roll. He kept a countdown in his head, and when I didn’t surface, he beached his boat on a sandbar, ripped off his spray skirt, and dove into the current, swimming as hard as he could until he reached me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He grabbed my boat as it flew downriver with my unconscious body dangling underneath. He tried to roll me, but my dead weight made it impossible, so he hung on the rounded hull until he found the grab loop to release the spray skirt and rip me out upside down.</p>



<p>I didn’t know how long I was underwater. You can suffer irreversible brain damage after five minutes without oxygen, but my half-breath had bought me more time. If Kadin hadn’t seen me flip, missed my boat in the current, or taken another minute to reach me, it would have been over.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We staggered along a dirt road, cut through a field, then followed another road to where we’d dropped his truck. We didn’t talk.</p>



<p>“Do you need me to go home with you?” he asked when we got back to my truck. His hands trembled on the steering wheel. We were both freezing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No, go home. I’m fine,” I said. I was always fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It took three tries to get the key into the ignition. The sound of the engine made me jump.</p>



<p>Foot on brake. Reverse. Drive. Gas. My leg trembled so hard on the pedal the truck shuddered.</p>



<p>I drove home with both hands on the wheel; I left my drenched clothes in a heap in the entryway. I turned the shower on, but the sound of the water sent shock waves through my body and I slapped the knob back off. Reeking of river water, I crawled into bed and willed the shaking to stop.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p>The next few days passed in a blur. I emptied the trash, checked the mail. Fed my cat in the morning and evening, responded to the most basic work emails. Dazedly coordinated an upcoming potluck dinner that I didn’t think to cancel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I told friends what happened, I called it “the kayak accident” and kept it flippant. I told them that yes I’d nearly drowned, but no they shouldn’t worry, care, or ask about it. When they did worry, care, and ask about it, I snapped like a cornered dog. <em>No questions. I said I didn’t want to talk about it.</em></p>



<p>I maintained this barbed facade, but inside I was coming apart. I woke up each night gasping for air. Sometimes my face was buried in my pillow and sometimes I’d been holding my breath. <em>How</em> <em>do our bodies know to keep breathing? </em>I wondered. <em>Is it safe to fall asleep?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Bruises blossomed from my thighs to my shins. My hips ached from slamming into the boat, and I was so tired I had to hold onto the wall walking upstairs. When I showered, I huddled terrified against the wall, trying to wash my hair without the water hitting my face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I hosted the dinner party a week later. To cancel would have meant I was exhausted and scared, and if I was exhausted and scared, I was weak. If I was weak, I was worthless. So instead of calling Kadin and telling him I wasn’t OK, or asking him if he also wasn’t OK, or talking to my family, or writing in a journal, I opened my front door to a dozen friends and drifted through the warm noise of music and conversation. <em>Where are the serving bowls? Do you want me to put this in the oven? Does Maggie have an ice maker?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Halfway through the night I grabbed a bowl of food scraps to toss in the compost. The din dulled to near-silence as I stepped into my backyard and pulled the slider shut. Loud to quiet. Above water to under water. OK to not OK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like dripping wax, the patio and window glow melted together, and a muted thrumming pounded in my ears. I slid down the side of my house as pinpricks spotted my vision and my breathing went ragged and gasping. It was my first panic attack from the accident, but it wouldn’t be my last.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>&nbsp;It was my first panic attack from the accident, but it wouldn’t be my last.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It got worse after that. I was haunted by a newfound fear of consequences, made worse by a desperation to maintain my fearlessness, the basis of my self-worth. I still went outside, but I was terrified. A creak overhead meant a branch was about to crush me, clouds gathering over a distant peak meant a lightning strike. I camped at an alpine lake and lie awake in my tent, picturing yellow eyes watching from the trees. I never got back in my kayak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More distressing than this new timidness were the dissociative episodes that started shortly after the accident. Multiple times each day I would find myself drifting out of reality, wondering how everyone was coping after my death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My final thought before losing consciousness had been accepting my own death, and part of my brain still existed in the space where I never woke up. I’d stare at my hands in yoga, splayed like pale starfish on the mat, and wonder what flowers my mom had chosen for my memorial. A stab of anguish as I walked to the mailbox: had my little cat been brought back to the animal shelter, or had one of my friends taken him in? Then I’d blink and be back in yoga class or standing in front of my mailbox with the key held limply in my hand.</p>



<p>These flashes of dissociation became more frequent. I had to remind myself every day that I hadn’t died—I still lived in my house with the flowering perennial bed and mismatched thrift-store furniture. My family hadn’t gathered in Montana to sort out the accumulation of debris that made up my life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It seemed too dramatic to call it PTSD. Was I so fragile that a few minutes underwater had such an impact?&nbsp; I didn’t even know if the accident could be classified as a near-death experience. I hadn’t seen the light at the end of a tunnel or felt myself leaving my body. I hadn’t even needed to be resuscitated—hypoxia caused me to plummet into unconsciousness, but as soon as I reoxygenated, my body started to function and I could breathe on my own. I felt weak and fragile, unable to quantify what was happening and too ashamed to confront the poor decisions that led me there.</p>



<p>Despite my denial, what was happening to my brain <em>was</em> a form of dissociation from the traumatic event, and a noted element of PTSD. People who have come close to death report more dissociative responses than other trauma survivors, and while the episodes typically do eventually fade, the more I tried to pretend I was OK, the longer they would last.</p>



<hr>



<p>It took weeks to tell my family what had happened, and I did it in a rush through the crackly Bluetooth connection on my way to the grocery store.</p>



<p>“I had a close call kayaking a few weeks ago,” I told my mom, rattling through the bullet points before she could interject. <em>Hit a downed log, flipped my boat, trapped underwater, my friend got to me in time, it was fine.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>She responded, slowly, but I wasn’t listening. The words I wanted to say felt lodged in my throat, and I ran them through my head like dialogue with the mic cut off.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<em>I don’t kno</em><em>w if I’m dead or alive. Every night I wake up feeling like I’m suffocating and if a loud room goes quiet I have a panic attack. I’m sad and scared and I don’t know why I didn’t die or if there’s a reason I survived and why I ignored all of the risk and almost killed myself.</em></p>



<p>I didn’t say any of that, but I did surprise myself by blurting out an apology before I hung up.</p>



<p>“I’m really sorry,” I said, horrified as I got choked up. “I love you guys and I won’t do anything stupid like that again.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kadin was the only one I thought I trusted to talk about it, though when he finally called me one evening a few weeks later, I still couldn’t drop my veneer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I just think . . . you know . . . you could have died, and I’m sorry,” he said. “It really scared me seeing you not come up for air, and I don’t know how to talk about it and I’m sorry I brought you out there.” I paced around in my kitchen, holding my phone at arm’s length like I could be electrocuted through the speaker.</p>



<p>I fumbled a response, still managing not to say anything honest or raw. <em>I’ll thank him later, </em>I told myself, <em>when I tell him what’s been going on in my brain. Maybe he’s going through the same thing.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>After that conversation we settled into a quiet understanding: two guarded people who had narrowly escaped a serious consequence.</p>



<hr>



<p>Once we established a different rapport, I saw a lot of Kadin. What would have thrilled me before (acceptance) was now a relief (someone who understood).&nbsp;</p>



<p>We climbed together and took long drives into the mountains. We hiked picnic food up to a remote lake, and once we recovered the kayaks from the river, I stored them both in my garage. I felt deeply connected to him, though I fought the idea since he was still the enigma that kept me chasing the end of a string, picking at the knot to see if it could be unraveled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No one else heard the noise I made as the air came back into my lungs. No one else had beached their boat and swam toward me as alpine runoff deadened their limbs. No one else kept their eyes on my upside-down boat and no one else risked the current and strainers to drag an unconscious girl out of a kayak. If he’d waited another few beats, missed the sandbar, not connected with my boat as the current carried him past, I would have died.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You two have some sort of weird bond,” my friend muttered as I slide-tackled Kadin on the gym mats one day that fall.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I mean, he saved my life.” At that point, she knew to nod and not ask me to elaborate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He was still Kadin, though, trauma bonded or not. He’d disappear for a month at a time, not return my calls, skip our planned yoga classes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My brain had reached more of an equilibrium by then. I still drifted in and out of reality, wondering who had taken over my house and which one of my friends had my cat. But I’d just smile apologetically to whoever I was with as I startled back to reality.</p>



<p>“Sorry, can you repeat that? I was spacing out.”&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p>Fall rolled into winter and our boats hadn’t left my garage. I brushed off the cobwebs and hung them on hooks, telling myself I’d talk to Kadin in the spring and confront the accident, possibly ask if he wanted to take the roll clinic with me. I’d feel safer with him there. Maybe it would close the gap and allow me to move on.</p>



<p>In the meantime, I spent that winter trying to understand the event from a clinical perspective.</p>



<p>I replayed the accident obsessively in my head, ashamed at my choices while trying to understand where they’d come from. I blamed my personality, I blamed living in a mountain town, I blamed incorrect risk perception after too many close calls, I blamed wanting to impress Kadin. If I could create a flowchart of decisions and personality traits that led me to the river that day, I would guarantee that it never happened again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I knew my reduced risk inhibition came from too many narrow escapes, and having a more experienced partner had created an “expert halo” that tipped the adventure-experience scale to a dangerous imbalance. At the same time, I hadn’t been looking to push my limits like the sensation-seeking personalities I kept reading about, people who needed big thrills to feel things. Those people often have lower trait anxiety, which means they feel less anxious in day-to-day life. While I loved being outside and did seek certain types of adventure, I have always had high anxiety and didn’t <em>enjoy</em> the feeling of fear. I’d just learned to ignore it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually I talked to Jerry Johnson, a professor in town who researches backcountry risk assessment. Nothing about my story seemed to surprise him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You wonder how these accidents don’t happen more frequently in towns like this, where the bar is so high,” he said. “You’re responding to social cues. How you perform in these sports contributes to your self-worth and value. You want to be able to keep up.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>I nodded, slowly. He was so matter-of-fact. It wasn’t what I wanted to hear, but it was the truth. I wasn’t a thrill seeker; I was someone who wanted to fit in and was scared of being left behind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The brain split was the other major element I wanted to untangle. The dissociative episodes were still part of my life on a near-daily basis, but that winter, no one I spoke to had any idea what I was talking about.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry,” a counselor said over the phone. “I’ve never heard of anything like that.”</p>



<p>Eventually, long after my initial outreach, I heard back from another counselor I reached out to. Not for therapy, but for more information about this split. Parker Schneider specializes in acute and complex trauma, and has a background in adventure-based programming. They offered precise, pertinent feedback about what I was describing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Near-death experiences are almost always traumatic and can be incredibly profound,” Schneider said. “[They leave] the nervous system grappling with processing the intense emotions and sensations involved in the experience.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Schneider seemed familiar with what I had been experiencing, and told me that dissociation can be a way for someone to get through during the near-death experience (NDE), as well as a way to cope afterward while the brain works to integrate the experience.</p>



<p>“After an NDE, dissociation might manifest as the mind alternating between different perceptions of reality,” Schneider told me. “This could involve oscillating between a reality in which an individual survived the event and one in which they died.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between this measured explanation of my lapses in reality, and Johnson’s quiet understanding of my need to keep up, I felt more tethered to reality. I also felt like I could begin to forgive myself.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p>It was January, eight months after the accident, and Kadin had bailed on another yoga class. I was bristling, tired of his flakiness and though I didn’t want to admit it, stung by the perceived rejection.</p>



<p>I had just gotten home when a mutual friend called.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Mags, you’re going to want to go to the hospital. It’s Kadin. I thought you’d want to know.”</p>



<p>I wasn’t part of Kadin’s primary friend group, so I wasn’t included in the communications from the past few days. The only thing I knew was that he was in the hospital and he wasn’t going to make it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I drove across town in a hysterical frenzy, racing through wing after wing until I found the right room. I grabbed his hand in the hospital bed, dissolving into despair and guilt. He was in front of me—his curly sandy-colored hair and climbers’ forearms and calf tattoo—but inaccessible. I sobbed and thanked him and apologized for not saying it enough. I said everything I’d wanted to say since May but it was too late, he couldn’t hear me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I pictured him swimming the current to my boat, releasing the spray skirt and grabbing me under the arms to pull me out, the countdown clock also running through his head. <em>How long has she been underwater?</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>I had been inches from him, unconscious in my boat in that liminal space between life and death. And now, here he was in front of me, in between but already gone. There was no current to swim and I couldn’t pull him out of a boat and bring him to the surface. My time stretches into the future but his is over.</p>



<p>This is what he knew: he knew he saved me from drowning, that I cared about him, that we were trauma bonded and that maybe I loved him for saving me. But I was too mired in regret and terror to tell him that when I woke up suffocating in my sleep, then realized I could breathe, the panic gave way to gratitude for being alive.</p>



<p>I am sorry for my choices and grateful for my second chances. I’ve never gone back on that river and I’ve never truly untangled the web of decisions that made me agree to go boating that day. Maybe someday I’ll be able to face it. Until then, I accept that fear helps protect me and I appreciate every day for being one I didn’t think I’d have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s been five years. Both of our boats still hang from hooks in my garage. Every few months I clear off the cobwebs.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  



  
  <p><time datetime="2024-04-16T19:21:08-0400">Tuesday April 16, 2024</time> <span>[<a href="https://jerry.wtf/tags/blog">blog</a>]</span></p>
  <p><img src="https://jerry.wtf/img/potions.jpg" alt="Potions"></p>
<p>I find that when I play RPG games, I often hoard single-use items like potions and scrolls, saving them for some future critical moment. I finish games like Skyrim with a backpack full of unspent resources, reserved for a crisis that never actually arrives. What’s the point, then, of all these items?</p>
<p>Just like I save items in games, in real life I too am reluctant to ask for favors or promote my own projects. (Sometimes I even save all my favourite treats and I never eat the last one). I treated these social and professional resources as if they were single-use “magical items”, not to be wasted but reserved for some important-yet-undefined future magnum opus event.</p>
<p>Recently I played Baldur’s Gate 3 and I decided to try something new: I would actually <em>gasp</em> use my items as needed, as they were intended, without undue reservation. Not only was it actually <em>fun</em> to use my fireball scrolls and blow stuff up, but I also discovered new layers and hidden quests. For instance, using a ‘Speak with the Dead’ scroll on a certain suspicious corpse unveiled a questline I would have otherwise missed.</p>
<p>With the same mindset, I’ve been trying to adjust in my personal and professional life.</p>
<p>To my surprise, these actions didn’t exhaust my social or professional capital; instead, they allowed me to derive benefits and opened new avenues, much like in the game. A friend forwarded my resume within their network, and my posts connected me with others who shared my interests.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s far more important in life that you use the resources available to you, because you’re on a clock. You need to optimize for your gains wherever you can take them, before you or your resources expire.</p>
<p>And remember, people in your life actually want to help you. They also stand to benefit, and any sort of social capital isn’t necessarily “single-use”, more like “on a cooldown”, able to be requested again after a suitable delay or returning a favor.</p>
<p>Resources, whether in games or in life, are meant to be utilized. Hoarding them out of fear of depletion prevents us from discovering new opportunities and connections. That’s a scarcity mindset that we don’t need to employ. Life thrives not on conservation but on strategic and bold usage of what we do have.</p>
<p>We should not view our capabilities and opportunities as limited-use potions to be saved for the perfect moment. Instead, we should see them as tools (sometimes with a cooldown) and aptly use them to unblock ourselves and move ahead whenever possible, in the very short time that we have on Earth.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="bEWGdV">If you’re a millennial, you may remember that specific moment in time around the late 2000s when streaming video technology had just gotten good but there weren’t that many legitimate streaming platforms available yet. So if you were a student without a TV and you wanted to watch a show, you would go to a website that aggregated lists of illegal streams. </p>
<p id="L5SnQB">It would be covered in banner ads and autoplaying video ads decorated with little play button arrows, and in order to watch your show, you would have to solve the puzzle of figuring out which play button to click that would actually get you to your show instead of spiriting you away to a website that sold upsetting porn or amateurish video games. It could be done, but you had to be paying attention, and you had to have the barest modicum of web savvy to do it right.</p>
<p id="RJPlOm">Right now, navigating the ebook and audiobook marketplaces is like being back on those sites. There are a thousand banner ads larded with keywords, and they’re all trying to get your clicks.</p>
<p id="qwH07V">Take, for example, when tech journalist Kara Swisher’s <em>Burn Book</em> came out this February. A host of other books hit the Kindle store along with it. They all had bizarre, SEO-streamlined titles, like those new businesses that are named <a href="https://searchengineland.com/near-me-searches-local-seo-optimize-or-avoid-385227">Plumbing Near Me</a> to game the <a href="https://www.vox.com/google" data-source="encore">Google</a> algorithm. </p>
<p id="cHXibO">“I found ‘Kara Swisher: Silicon Valley’s Bulldog,’ and ‘Kara Swisher Book: How She Became Silicon Valley’s Most Influential Journalist,’ and ‘Kara Swisher Biography: Unraveling the Life and Legacy,’ by a ‘guy’ who ‘wrote’ four biographies this month,” <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/03/03/2024/semaforum-kara-swisher?utm_medium=media&amp;utm_campaign=intel&amp;utm_source=newslettercta">said Ben Smith when he interviewed Swisher for Semaforum</a>. </p>
<p id="hsA8kl">Swisher was less than flattered by the biographies. “I wrote [<a href="https://www.vox.com/amazon" data-source="encore">Amazon</a> CEO] <a href="https://www.vox.com/andy-jassy" data-source="encore">Andy Jassy</a> and I said, ‘You’re stealing my IP! What is going on?’” <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/03/03/2024/semaforum-kara-swisher?utm_medium=media&amp;utm_campaign=intel&amp;utm_source=newslettercta">she told Smith</a>. (Disclosure: Swisher works for <a href="https://corp.voxmedia.com/" data-source="encore">Vox Media</a>.) </p>
<p id="E7KAS5">Here is almost certainly what was going on: “Kara Swisher book” started trending on the Kindle storefront as buzz built up for Swisher’s book. Keyword scrapers that exist for the sole purpose of finding such search terms delivered the phrase “Kara Swisher book” to the so-called biographer, who used a combination of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/4/28/23702644/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-technology" data-source="encore">AI</a> and crimes-against-humanity-level cheap ghostwriters to generate a series of books they could plausibly title and sell using her name. </p>
<p id="nRgNut">The biographer in question was just one in a vast, hidden ecosystem centered on the production and distribution of very cheap, low-quality ebooks about increasingly esoteric subjects. Many of them gleefully share misinformation or repackage basic facts from WikiHow behind a title that’s been search-engine-optimized to hell and back again. Some of them even <a href="https://janefriedman.com/i-would-rather-see-my-books-pirated/">steal the names of well-established existing authors</a> and masquerade as new releases from those writers. According to the Authors Guild, it would be impossible for anyone but Amazon to quantify these books — and that’s not information Amazon is sharing.</p>
<p id="OOWtfd">All of this means that to buy the book you want — to buy Kara Swisher’s <em>Burn Book</em> instead of <em>Kara Swisher Book: How She Became Silicon Valley’s Most Influential Journalist</em> — you have to know what you’re looking for and pay a modicum of attention to your purchase. </p>
<p id="Se5L2w">Who wants to do that? Especially in a marketplace like Amazon, where we are trained to buy quickly and thoughtlessly with a single click and where writers have been trained to send their wares without even thinking about it because where else are you going to sell an ebook.</p>
<p id="xa5P1k">It’s so <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a45751827/make-a-living-as-a-writer/">difficult for most authors to make a living from their writing</a> that we sometimes lose track of how much money there is to be made from books, if only we could save costs on the laborious, time-consuming process of writing them. </p>
<p id="pAsCtu">The internet, though, has always been a safe harbor for those with plans to innovate that pesky writing part out of the actual book publishing. On the internet, it’s possible to <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet-books/2010/04/retyping-an-entire-book-is-one-thing-cutting-pasting-an-entire-book-is-another">copy text from one platform</a> and paste it into another seamlessly, to <a href="https://bookriot.com/how-easy-is-it-to-pirate-books/">share text files</a>, to build <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/books3-ai-meta-llama-pirated-books/675063/">vast databases of stolen books</a>. If you wanted to design a place specifically to pirate and sleazily monetize books, it would be hard to do better than the internet as it has long existed. </p>
<p id="AkXCaQ">Now, generative AI has made it possible to create cover images, outlines, and even text at the click of a button. </p>
<p id="2eQMx7">If, as they used to say, everyone has a book in them, AI has created a world where tech utopianists dream openly about excising the human part of writing a book — any amount of artistry or craft or even just sheer effort — and replacing it with machine-generated streams of text; as though putting in the labor of writing is a sucker’s game; as though caring whether or not what you’re reading is nonsense is only for elitists. The future is now, and it is filled with trash books that no one bothered to really write and that certainly no one wants to read. </p>
<p id="a5tdKa">The saddest part about it, though, is that the garbage books don’t actually make that much money either. It’s even possible to lose money generating your low-quality ebook to sell on Kindle for $0.99. The way people make money these days is by teaching students the process of making a garbage ebook. It’s grift and garbage all the way down — and the people who ultimately lose out are the readers and writers who love books.</p>
<p id="B4z57j">None of this is happening through any willful malice, per se, on the part of the platforms that now run publishing and book-selling. It’s happening more because the platforms are set up to incentivize everything to cost as little as possible, even if it’s garbage. </p>
<p id="sIe1Uj">In a statement, Amazon spokesperson Ashley Vanicek said, “We aim to provide the best possible shopping, reading, and publishing experience, and we are constantly evaluating developments that impact that experience, which includes the rapid evolution and expansion of generative AI tools.” </p>
<p id="lxPBZv">Yet the garbage books predate the problem of AI. Here’s how they get made in the first place.</p>
<h3 id="nmmNPM">The scammy underbelly of online self-publishing</h3>
<p id="t3KgBi">These days, the trash ebook publishing landscape is fully saturated with grifters. There are blogs that talk about the industry, but they tend to be <a href="https://www.scamrisk.com/publishing-life-reviews/">clickbait sites</a> riddled with SEO keywords and affiliate links back and forth between each other. Virtually every single part of the self-publishing grift world that can be automated or monetized has been automated and monetized.</p>
<p id="cwMsmw">If you look a few years back, however, you find a very different landscape. In the internet of the early 2010s, lots of people were excited about making money with trash ebooks and trash audiobooks, but they weren’t yet all trying to scam one another on top of their eventual readers. They wrote real blogs about the process of the grift with their real human voices. They distinguished between schemes that were “white hat” (following the rules) and “black hat” (violating some terms of service). They compared strategies and teachers of strategies.</p>
<p id="NkivTh">According to the blogs of the era, one of the most infamous teachers was a man who went by Luca de Stefani, or Big Luca. <a href="http://www.leveluplifestyle.net/self-publishing-revolution-by-luca-de-stefani-review/">Legend had it</a> he held the world record for making the most money using Kindle Publishing in a single day. What set Big Luca’s Self Publishing Revolution course apart from the rest — Big Luca’s “black hat breadwinner video lesson,” <a href="https://www.freedomboundbusiness.com/self-publishing-revolution-review/">per one review</a> — was that he gave his students access to a secret Facebook group where self-publishers organized review swaps and buys.</p>
<p id="ekPspX">For the self-publishing grift, good reviews are crucial. The more five-star reviews a book has, the more likely Amazon’s algorithm is to push it toward readers. If you’re mostly publishing trash books, you’re not going to get tons of five-star reviews organically. Big Luca’s Facebook group gave grifters a place to offer to swap five-star reviews or sell five-star reviews for $0.99 a pop. As far as Amazon’s algorithm was concerned, there was no difference between that kind of review and the one a real reader might leave. The results were extremely lucrative.</p>
<p id="6XGe05">Luca didn’t invent this formula. He learned it from the OG <a href="https://www.freedomboundbusiness.com/self-publishing-revolution-review/">self-publishing grift course K Money Mastery</a>, now apparently defunct, where he excelled. </p>
<p id="DHSExt">Eventually, Big Luca had wrung all the money he could from the self-publishing hustle. He climbed up to the next level of the pyramid and became a teacher, and in 2016, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfpublish/comments/8ykdse/has_anyone_tried_the_self_publishing_revolution/">the lore goes</a>, a man named Christian Mikkelsen enrolled in Big Luca’s Self Publishing Revolution.</p>
<p id="y5Whhu">The Mikkelsen twins are named Christian and Rasmus, and they are 28 years old. They have dark blond hair and blue eyes and meticulously groomed facial hair, and they always seem to be posting to <a href="https://www.vox.com/instagram-news" data-source="encore">Instagram</a> from luxurious private pools that are also somehow exotic beaches. They have managed, in what must be fairly acknowledged as a feat of branding wizardry, to hold on to the domain Publishing.com, and there they peddle their wares: a course they say can help students make a lifetime of easy cash off the revenue from books they don’t even have to bother to write themselves. If they happen to land a student who wants to write a book in good faith and just doesn’t understand how to sell their book on their own, well, they’re happy to take money from that student, too. </p>
<p id="9yRxdA"><a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/202309/eric-hagerman/how-mikkelsen-twins-built-a-50-million-a-year-business-around-one-product.html">According to a profile in Inc.</a>, Christian found his way into the self-publishing world by googling “how to make money online.” His first book was a brief ebook titled <em>How to Be a 4.0 Student in College, Like Me</em>. Big Luca’s method apparently served him well enough that he thought it would be worthwhile to bring his twin Rasmus into the fold. </p>
<p id="TYdZXS">Together, the <a href="https://youtu.be/biYciU1uiUw?t=1295">Mikkelsens published trash book after trash book</a>, guides to keto and sex and crystals. Then they started running their manuscripts through Google Translate to start selling foreign language editions, an innovation on the old grift that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PhoenixFire144/">bumped their income into six figures</a> and, after a few months, got Amazon to block their publishing account. The time had come, <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/202309/eric-hagerman/how-mikkelsen-twins-built-a-50-million-a-year-business-around-one-product.html">as Inc. would put it</a>, to “do what entrepreneurs do”: pivot. They started a <a href="https://www.vox.com/youtube" data-source="encore">YouTube</a> channel so they could teach the business of self-publishing to anyone else who wanted to learn. Six months and 1,000 subscribers later, they launched their first paywalled online course. </p>
<p id="uZVSzg">First it was called Audiobook Impact Academy. Then it was Publishing Life. Now, with AI an ever-more-fashionable buzzword, it’s AI Publishing Academy. It’s always more or less the same method, with a few new tweaks in every new iteration. But the method doesn’t change as much as you might think.</p>
<h3 id="sOnZ0D">How the garbage books get made: A case study</h3>
<p id="tXzRNS">If you want to take the Mikkelsen course, the first thing you do is sit through their sales pitch. It runs for two hours, and it’s just a video of Christian sitting in a dark room, drinking thirstily from a water bottle as he shows you screencaps of his students’ royalty checks and repeats that he is already rich; he doesn’t have to show you how to make this kind of money. He’s doing it for fun. </p>
<p id="hkTYi7">Christian’s offer is, he says, unbeatable. He will show you how to produce a book without having to write it. “What used to be the hardest part in the process — which was creating that book that you upload onto Amazon — is now the easiest part, and the most fun,” Christian explains. “Because AI can help do that for you.”</p>
<p id="fzo6Zk">Specifically, AI will write your outline for you. The twins feel that the quality isn’t there on purely AI-generated books yet; they demand better for their readers than AI prose. Still, they say using AI to outline saves their students weeks of researching their own manuscripts.</p>
<p id="LgZahW">That AI is part of but not central to the process is a helpful talking point for the Mikkelsens as Amazon strengthens its regulations against purely AI-generated text for sale. </p>
<p id="QXdsiA">“Last year we began requiring all publishers using our Kindle Direct Publishing service to provide information about whether their content is AI-generated and further reduced the total number of titles that can be published in a day,” said Amazon spokesperson Vanicek. Vanicek added that they have “a robust set of methods” to detect content that violates their guidelines, and they regularly remove those books and sometimes suspend the publishing accounts of repeat offenders.</p>
<p id="u6iVKv">“The thought of human creativity being overshadowed by <a href="https://www.vox.com/robots" data-source="encore">robots</a> isn’t exactly the prettiest picture,” Christian wrote in a (suspiciously ChatGPT-sounding) <a href="https://www.publishing.com/blog/how-does-ai-writing-work?">blog post</a> in March. “But we’re here to set the record straight. There are two camps of AI use out there: AI-generated and AI-assisted. They are completely different.” </p>
<p id="rZCp4A">In April, however, the Mikkelsens announced that they were preparing to launch a new proprietary AI program, Publishing.ai, that they promise will write a manuscript for you, “Soooo much faster than a ghostwriter!” </p>
<p id="XAtWaJ">Under the Mikkelsen model, you also don’t have to pick your own topic. They give you access to keyword scrapers that have pulled trending topics off Kindle and Audible.  And once AI is finished with your outline, you can send it over to a ghostwriter to turn into a book for a mere $500. For a 30,000-word book, that works out to a fee of $0.016667 per word. (The Mikkelsens work with a ghostwriting company developed by two former students. There, ghostwriters get hired on a freelance basis and are kept anonymous.) </p>
<p id="wKsgHj">Once you have your manuscript, Christian promises, the twins will show you how to hire audiobook narrators for a flat $20 fee by haggling their prices down. They’ll introduce you to a network of people who are generous with their five-star ratings and will push your book up the algorithmic Amazon rankings for you. All you have to do is sit back and collect your royalty checks as you rake in month after month of passive income. </p>
<p id="vcHlhB">As Christian talks, he seems to cast a kind of hypnotic spell. You start to wonder: “Am I stupid for not having invested in ebook publishing before now?” You see five-figure check after five-figure check. A ticking clock turns on. Christian wants to give you a special rate for the course. The course is worth $15,500. The regular price is $6,000. But he’s willing to give it to you for just $1,995 as long as you’re one of the first people to sign up after the webinar ends!</p>
<p id="14W5uD">None of what the Mikkelsens are describing here is illegal, but if you know the norms of publishing, you know it’s unethical. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biYciU1uiUw">documentarian Dan Olson</a> lays out in a lengthy 2022 deep dive into the Mikkelsens, their method of publishing means developing a book you’re probably not qualified to write. It used to mean paying a ghostwriter starvation-level wages to churn out a manuscript; now it means creating a book likely riddled with misinformation and minimal means of correcting it. It means deceiving readers with fake reviews. (That one can get you kicked off Amazon if you get caught.)</p>
<p id="NEiyDk">If you aren’t versed in publishing’s industry standards, however, the Mikkelsen model can seem incredibly attractive.</p>
<p id="yABemr">“I was like, ‘Yup, this would be great.’ I was totally vibing with it,” recalls Jennifer (whose name has been changed to protect her privacy), a 37-year-old in Virginia, who signed up for the twins’ course in September. She had recently written and self-published her own book on Amazon, but she wasn’t sure what to do to start promoting it. </p>
<p id="U1wPsB">The twins’ sales pitch struck her as the perfect solution: She could provide her ideas, people who were good with words could rewrite her draft and polish the whole thing up into a sales-ready package, and everyone would get paid. “I was like, ‘Okay, I’m ready to invest and make this a better thing.”</p>
<p id="nyKJmv">“It was a very efficient, friendly, interactive webinar,” recalls Cecilia (also not her real name), a Seattle-based 50-year-old who works in the health space. She signed up for the twins’ seminar in September, and she remembers being pleasantly won over by that two-hour sales pitch. It seemed to be so transparent. “It promoted trustworthiness,” she says. </p>
<p id="EWDAck">Once Jennifer and Cecilia had turned over their money for the course, both of them changed their minds fast.</p>
<p id="XtGKCh">“I started listening to the modules,” Jennifer says. “And I don’t know how else to describe them” — there is a long, expressive pause — “but as a jet stream of bullshit.”</p>
<p id="fjZmmh">“All it does is tell you to buy different products,” Jennifer recalls of the Mikkelsen course. “It’s like there’s nothing that they actually provide themselves, other than ‘Go buy other people’s products’ — and I’m sure they own those too, right?” (We can’t confirm that the Mikkelsens do own the products they recommend, but the ghostwriting company they work with <em>is</em> run by former Mikkelsen students.)</p>
<p id="soVflw">The course cost $2,000, but that wasn’t enough. To get a Mikkelsen-approved topic for your book, you had to pay for access to the software that analyzed Amazon keywords to tell you what was trending. To create the perfect outline, you had to pay for access to the AI that outlined and drafted your book for you. You had to pay for the cover design and for the reviewers. The $2,000 fee was supposed to guarantee you frequent one-on-one calls with a publishing coach, but the coaching calls were mostly about upselling to the premium $7,800 course, Jennifer says.</p>
<p id="9W4XoB">After a few weeks of phone calls, Cecilia decided she had had enough of the program and asked for her money back. She didn’t expect it would be a problem, since the course was advertised as fully refundable. Customer service reps then told her that, to qualify for a refund, she had to prove she’d sat through the whole course, published a book, and failed to make her money back. She says she had to threaten to call the attorney general before they sent her money back without such proof. </p>
<p id="C4J2sn">Jennifer wrote off her $2,000 as the cost of learning a bad lesson, but she wanted to warn other people against making the same mistake. She posted a negative review of Publishing.com on the user review site TrustPilot, where it has a 4.7 rating. So did Cecilia. Both of them found their reviews queried by TrustPilot, which required them to submit proof of going through the course in order to keep their reviews up. Most of the course’s five-star reviews, however, remain unverified. I reached out to some of the five-star TrustPilot reviewers to get their take on the Mikkelsens’ course, but I never heard back from any of them.</p>
<p id="fOFJnm">After the Mikkelsens’ course got big,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/gh23d7/mikkelsen_twins_scam/"> the rumors on Reddit say</a> Big Luca was furious that they’d ripped off his business model. He used to brag that he was going to drag them into court. Instead, he got out of the self-publishing game. </p>
<p id="QIbhsr">Now he runs a program called Big Luca International or, more informally, School for the Rich, <a href="https://www.biglucainternational.com/en/company/">self-described as</a> “the world’s leading company in online marketing training.” It’s supposed to teach you how to monetize any online business — the self-publishing black hat breadwinning tricks, extrapolated out to all the other industries of the internet. With the advent of AI, it’s easier than ever to flood the whole digital ecosystem with trash in pursuit of passive income.</p>
<h3 id="q4uV2N">The neverending grift</h3>
<p id="p8ZToN">“It sucks that I did this,” Jennifer says of her experience at AI Publishing Academy. “But I mean, it’s put some fire under my butt to do it [marketing] myself for my own books.” </p>
<p id="ZnUyKr">Jennifer didn’t set out to make a quick buck with a garbage ebook. She did the work of writing a book because she believed in it. The Mikkelsens got her because she couldn’t figure out how to sell her book on her own, and part of the reason she couldn’t sell it is because the marketplace is already so flooded with books. Many of which are garbage books.</p>
<p id="Vz0oQp">The Mikkelsens are not the chief villains of this story. They are small-time operators working one level of a very big grift industry. The grift is that technology and retail platforms have incentivized a race to the bottom when it comes to selling books. Together, without ever caring enough about the issue to deliberately try to do so, they have built a landscape in which it’s hard to trust what you read and hard to sell what you write.</p>
<p id="IvzxfT">The incentives of the modern book-selling economy for writers are to keep your costs low, low, low and your volume high, high, high, and definitely put your book on Amazon because where else are you going to sell an ebook? The incentive of the modern book-buying economy for readers is to go onto Amazon and lazily click around with a few search terms, and then buy the first book that looks right with the click of a single button. The incentives are, in other words, driving us all straight into a flood of garbage. </p>
<p id="VJOBa6">That’s what the grift does. It finds every spot in the process of making and selling a book that is inconvenient or laborious, and it exploits those spots. It exploits our cultural belief that books are meaningful, that writing a book is a valuable act, that reading a book will enrich your life. When it’s finished, you’re left with something that’s not a real book but a book-shaped digital file filled with nothing of any use to anyone at all. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-7785">
	
	<div>
		
<p>If you’re a normal person — that is, a person who doesn’t obsessively follow the latest cryptography news — you probably missed last week’s cryptography bombshell. That news comes in the form of a new e-print authored by Yilei Chen, “<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/555">Quantum Algorithms for Lattice Problems</a>“, which has roiled the cryptography research community. The result is now being evaluated by experts in lattices and quantum algorithm design (<em>and to be clear, I am not one!</em>) but if it holds up, it’s going to be quite a bad day/week/month/year for the applied cryptography community.</p>



<p>Rather than elaborate at length, here’s quick set of five bullet-points giving the background.</p>



<p>(1) Cryptographers like to build modern public-key encryption schemes on top of mathematical problems that are believed to be “hard”. In practice, we need problems with a specific structure: we can construct <em>efficient</em> solutions for those who hold a secret key, or “trapdoor”, and yet also admit <em>no efficient solution</em> for folks who don’t. While many problems have been considered (and often discarded), most schemes we use today are based on three problems: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization">factoring</a> (the RSA cryptosystem), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm">discrete logarithm</a> (Diffie-Hellman, DSA) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography">elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem</a> (EC-Diffie-Hellman, ECDSA etc.)</p>



<p>(2) While we would like to believe our favorite problems are fundamentally “hard”, we know this isn’t really true. Researchers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">have devised algorithms</a> that solve all of these problems quite efficiently (i.e., in polynomial time) — provided someone figures out how to build a quantum computer powerful enough to run the attack algorithms. <em>Fortunately such a computer has not yet been built!</em></p>



<p>(3) Even though quantum computers are not yet powerful enough to break our public-key crypto, the mere threat of <em>future</em> quantum attacks has inspired industry, government and academia to join forces <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography">Fellowship-of-the-Ring-style</a> in order to tackle the problem right now. This isn’t merely about future-proofing our systems: even if quantum computers take decades to build, future quantum computers could break encrypted messages we send <em>today</em>! </p>



<p>(4) One conspicuous outcome of this fellowship is <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms">NIST’s Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) competition</a>: this was an open competition designed to standardize<em> “post-quantum” cryptographic schemes</em>. Critically, these schemes must be based on different mathematical problems — most notably, problems that <em>don’t</em> seem to admit efficient quantum solutions. </p>



<p>(5) Within this new set of schemes, the most popular class of schemes are based on problems related to mathematical objects called <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography">lattices</a></em>. NIST-approved schemes based on lattice problems include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyber">Kyber</a> and <a href="https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/">Dilithium</a> (which I <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2023/11/30/to-schnorr-and-beyond-part-2/">wrote about recently</a>.) Lattice problems are also the basis of several efficient <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/01/02/very-casual-introduction-to-fully/">fully-homomorphic encryption</a> (FHE) schemes.</p>



<p>This background sets up the new result.</p>



<p>Chen’s (not yet peer-reviewed) <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/555">preprint</a> claims a<em> </em>new quantum algorithm that efficiently solves the “shortest independent vector problem” (SIVP, as well as GapSVP) in lattices with specific parameters. If it holds up, the result could (with numerous important caveats) allow future quantum computers to break schemes that depend on the hardness of specific instances of these problems. The good news here is that even if the result is correct, the vulnerable parameters are very specific: Chen’s algorithm does not <em>immediately</em> apply to the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms">recently-standardized NIST algorithms</a> such as Kyber or Dilithium. Moreover, the exact concrete complexity of the algorithm is not instantly clear: it may turn out to be impractical to run, even if quantum computers become available.</p>



<p>But there is a saying in our field that <em>attacks only get better. </em>If Chen’s result can be improved upon, then quantum algorithms could render obsolete an entire generation of “post-quantum” lattice-based schemes, forcing cryptographers <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-pq3/">and</a> <a href="https://signal.org/blog/pqxdh/">industry</a> <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/blog/5108747984306176/google-s-threat-model-for-post-quantum-cryptography">back</a> to the drawing board.</p>



<p>In other words, both a great technical result — and possibly a mild disaster.</p>



<p>As previously mentioned: I am neither an expert in lattice-based cryptography nor quantum computing. The folks who <em>are</em> those things are very busy trying to validate the writeup<em>:</em> and more than a few big results have fallen apart upon detailed inspection.<em> </em>For those searching for the latest developments, here’s a <a href="https://nigelsmart.github.io/LWE.html">nice writeup by Nigel Smart</a> that doesn’t tackle the correctness of the quantum algorithm (see updates at the bottom), but does talk about the possible implications for FHE and PQC schemes (TL;DR: bad for some FHE schemes, but really depends on the concrete details of the algorithm’s running time.) And here’s another <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/583.pdf">brief note on a “bug” that was found in the paper</a>, that seems to have been quickly <a href="http://www.chenyilei.net/">addressed by the author.</a></p>



<p>Up until this week I had intended to write another long wonky post about complexity theory, lattices, and what it all meant for applied cryptography. But now I hope you’ll forgive me if I hold onto that one, for just a little bit longer.</p>

<p><em><mark>“The word for world is forest” —&nbsp;Ursula K. Le Guin</mark></em></p>



<p>In the late 18th century, officials in Prussia and Saxony began to rearrange their complex, diverse forests into straight rows of single-species trees. Forests had been sources of food, grazing, shelter, medicine, bedding and more for the people who lived in and around them, but to the early modern state, they were simply a source of timber.</p>



<p>So-called “scientific forestry,” was that century’s growth hacking: it made timber yields easier to count, predict and harvest, and meant owners no longer relied on skilled local foresters to manage forests. They were replaced with lower-skilled laborers following basic algorithmic instructions to keep the monocrop tidy, the understory bare.</p>



<p>Information and decision-making power now flowed straight to the top. Decades later when the first crop was felled, vast fortunes were made, tree by standardized tree. The clear-felled forests were replanted, ready to extend the boom. Readers of the American political anthropologist of <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/james-c-scott-two-cheers-for-anarchism" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">anarchy</a> and order, James C. Scott, know <a href="https://files.libcom.org/files/Seeing%20Like%20a%20State%20-%20James%20C.%20Scott.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">what happened</a> next.</p>



<p>It was a disaster so bad that a new word, <em>Waldsterben</em>, or “forest death,” was minted to describe the result. All the same species and age, the trees were flattened in storms, ravaged by insects and disease — even the survivors were spindly and weak. Forests were now so tidy and bare they were all but dead. The first magnificent bounty had not been the beginning of endless riches, but a one-off harvesting of millennia of soil wealth built up by biodiversity and symbiosis. Complexity was the goose that laid golden eggs, and she had been slaughtered.</p>



<p>The story of German scientific forestry transmits a timeless truth: When we simplify complex systems, we destroy them, and the devastating consequences sometimes aren’t obvious until it’s too late.</p>



<p>That impulse to scour away the messiness that makes life resilient is what many conservation biologists <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2386849" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">call</a> the “pathology of command and control.” Today, the same drive to centralize, control and extract has driven the internet to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/21/opinion/internet-aging-gen-z.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">same fate</a> as the ravaged forests.</p>



<p>The internet’s 2010s, its boom years, may have been the first glorious harvest that exhausted a one-time bonanza of diversity. The complex web of human interactions that thrived on the internet’s initial technological diversity is now corralled into globe-spanning <a href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/data-shared-sold-whats-done/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">data-extraction</a> engines making huge fortunes for a tiny few.</p>



<p>Our online spaces are not ecosystems, though tech firms love <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2022/12/08/your-platform-is-not-an-ecosystem/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">that word</a>. They’re plantations; highly concentrated and controlled environments, closer kin to the industrial farming of the cattle feedlot or battery chicken farms that madden the creatures trapped within.</p>



<p>We all know this. We see it each time we reach for our phones. But what most people have missed is how this concentration reaches deep into the internet’s infrastructure — the pipes and protocols, cables and networks, search engines and browsers. These structures determine how we build and use the internet, now and in the future.</p>



<p>They’ve concentrated into a series of near-planetary duopolies: For example, as of April 2024, Google and Apple’s internet browsers have <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">captured</a> almost 85% of the world market share, Microsoft and Apple’s two desktop operating systems over<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/268237/global-market-share-held-by-operating-systems-since-2009/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"> 80%</a>. Google <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-host-market-share" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">runs</a> 84% of global search and Microsoft 3%. Slightly more than half of all phones <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/mobile" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">come from</a> Apple and Samsung, while over 99% of mobile operating systems <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/worldwide" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">run on</a> Google or Apple software.<sup> </sup>Two cloud computing providers, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure <a href="https://www.hava.io/blog/2024-cloud-market-share-analysis-decoding-industry-leaders-and-trends#:~:text=Amazon%20Web%20Services%20(AWS)%20maintains,in%20the%20Asia%2DPacific%20market." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">make up</a> over 50% of the global market. Apple and Google’s email clients <a href="https://www.litmus.com/email-client-market-share" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">manage</a> nearly 90% of global email. Google and Cloudflare serve around 50% of global domain name system requests.</p>



<p>Two kinds of everything may be enough to fill a fictional ark and repopulate a ruined world, but can’t run an open, global “network of networks” where everyone has the same chance to innovate and compete. No wonder internet engineer Leslie Daigle <a href="https://www.thinkingcat.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2019-InvariantsUpdated.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">termed</a> the concentration and consolidation of the internet’s technical architecture “‘climate change’ of the Internet ecosystem.”</p>



<h2 id="h-walled-gardens-have-deep-roots"><strong>Walled Gardens Have Deep Roots</strong></h2>



<p>The internet made the tech giants possible. Their services have scaled globally, via its open, interoperable core. But for the past decade, they’ve also worked to enclose the varied, competing and often open-source or collectively provided services the internet is built on into their proprietary domains. Although this improves their operational efficiency it also ensures the flourishing conditions of their own emergence aren’t repeated by potential competitors. For tech giants, the long period of open internet evolution is over. Their internet is not an ecosystem. It’s a zoo.</p>



<p>Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta are consolidating their control deep into the underlying infrastructure through acquisitions, vertical integration, building proprietary networks, creating chokepoints and concentrating functions from different technical layers into a single silo of top-down control. They can afford to, using the vast wealth reaped in their one-off harvest of collective, global wealth.</p>

      “Our online spaces are not ecosystems, though tech firms love that word. They’re plantations; highly concentrated and controlled environments … that madden the creatures trapped within.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>




<p>Taken together,&nbsp;the enclosure of infrastructure and imposition of technology monoculture forecloses our futures. Internet people like to talk about “the stack,” or the layered architecture of protocols, software and hardware, operated by different service providers that collectively delivers the daily miracle of connection. It’s a complicated, dynamic system with a basic value baked into the core design; key functions are kept separate to ensure resilience, generality and create room for innovation.</p>



<p><a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/distributed-computing/html/history.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Initially</a> funded by the U.S. military and designed by academic researchers to function in wartime, the internet evolved to work anywhere, in any condition, operated by anyone who wanted to connect. But what was a dynamic, ever-evolving game of Tetris with distinct “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcfadden-cnsldtn-effects/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">players” and “layers</a>” is today hardening into a continent-spanning system of compacted tectonic plates. Infrastructure is not just what we see on the surface; it’s the forces below, that make mountains and power tsunamis. Whoever controls infrastructure determines the future. If you doubt that, consider that in Europe we’re still using the roads and living in many towns and cities the Roman Empire mapped out 2,000 years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, some internet engineers in the global standards-setting body, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), raised the alarm. Daigle, a respected engineer who had previously chaired its oversight committee and internet architecture board, <a href="https://www.thinkingcat.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2019-InvariantsUpdated.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in a policy brief that consolidation meant network structures were ossifying throughout the stack, making incumbents harder to dislodge and violating a core principle of the internet: that it does not create “permanent favorites.” Consolidation doesn’t just squeeze out competition. It narrows the kinds of relationships possible between operators of different services. </p>



<p>As Daigle put it: “The more proprietary solutions are built and deployed instead of collaborative open standards-based ones, the less the internet survives as a platform for future innovation.” Consolidation kills collaboration between service providers through the stack by rearranging an array of different relationships — competitive, collaborative — into a single predatory one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, standards development organizations (SDOs) started several initiatives to name and tackle infrastructure consolidation, but these floundered. Bogged down in technical minutiae, unable to separate themselves from their employers’ interests and deeply held professional values of <a href="https://archive.org/details/whatengineerskno0000vinc" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">simplification and control</a>, most internet engineers simply couldn’t see the forest for the trees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Up close, internet concentration seems too intricate to untangle; from far away, it seems too difficult to deal with. But what if we thought of the internet not as a doomsday “<a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Hyperobjects.html?id=qu5zDwAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">hyperobject</a>,” but as a damaged and struggling ecosystem facing destruction? What if we looked at it not with helpless horror at the eldritch encroachment of its current controllers, but with compassion, constructiveness and hope?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Technologists are great at incremental fixes, but to regenerate entire habitats we need to learn from ecologists who take a whole-systems view. Ecologists know something just as important, too; how to keep going when others first ignore you and then say it’s too late, how to mobilize and work collectively, and how to build pockets of diversity and resilience that will outlast them, creating possibilities for an abundant future they can imagine but never control. We don’t need to repair the internet’s infrastructure. We need to rewild it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-rewilding"><strong>What Is Rewilding?</strong></h2>



<p>Rewilding “aims to restore healthy ecosystems by creating wild, biodiverse spaces,” <a href="https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/benefits-and-risks-rewilding" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">according</a> to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. More ambitious and risk-tolerant than traditional conservation, it targets entire ecosystems to make space for complex food webs and the emergence of unexpected interspecies relations. It’s less interested in saving specific endangered species. Individual species are just ecosystem components, and focusing on components loses sight of the whole. Ecosystems flourish through multiple points of contact between their many elements, just like computer networks. And like in computer networks, ecosystem interactions are multifaceted and generative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rewilding has much to offer people who care about the internet. As Paul Jepson and Cain Blythe wrote in <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046763/rewilding/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">their book</a> “Rewilding: The Radical New Science of Ecological Recovery,” rewilding pays attention “to the emergent properties of interactions between ‘things’ in ecosystems … a move from linear to systems thinking.”</p>



<p>It’s a fundamentally cheerful and workmanlike approach to what can seem insoluble problems. It doesn’t micromanage. It creates room for “ecological processes [which] foster complex and self-organizing ecosystems.” Rewilding puts into practice what every good manager knows: hire the best people you can, provide what they need to thrive, then get out of the way. It’s the opposite of command-and-control.</p>

      “Rewilding the internet is more than a metaphor. It’s a framework and plan.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>




<p>Rewilding the internet is more than a metaphor. It’s a framework and plan. It gives us fresh eyes for the wicked problem of extraction and control, and new means and allies to fix it. It recognizes that ending internet monopolies isn’t just an intellectual problem. It’s an emotional one. It answers questions like how do we keep going when the monopolies have more money and power? How do we act collectively when they suborn our community spaces, funding and networks? And how do we communicate to our allies what fixing it will look and feel like?</p>



<p>Rewilding is a positive vision for the networks we want to live inside, and a shared story for how we get there. It grafts a new tree onto technology’s tired old stock. And embodied in rewilding’s ecological tools is the collective wisdom of an entire discipline already tackling humanity’s toughest, systemic problems.</p>

If you’re a geek, you probably programmed your own computer to make basic games. You certainly remember a web with more to read than the <a href="https://theconversation.com/we-spent-six-years-scouring-billions-of-links-and-found-the-web-is-both-expanding-and-shrinking-159215" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">same five</a> websites. You may have even written your own blog.</p>



<p>But many people born after 2000 probably think a world with few insects, little ambient noise from birdcalls, where you regularly use only a few social media and messaging apps (rather than a whole <em>web</em>) is normal. As Jepson and Blythe wrote, shifting baselines are “where each generation assumes the nature they experienced in their youth to be normal and unwittingly accepts the declines and damage of the generations before.” Damage is already baked in. It even seems natural.</p>



<p>Ecology knows that shifting baselines dampen collective urgency and deepen generational divides. People who care about internet monoculture and control are often told they’re nostalgists harkening back to a pioneer era. But it’s fiendishly hard to regenerate an open and competitive infrastructure for younger generations who’ve been raised to assume that two or three platforms, two app stores, two operating systems, two browsers, one cloud/mega-store and a single search engine for the world comprise <em>the internet</em>. If the internet for you is the massive sky-scraping silo you happen to live inside and the only thing you can see outside is the single, other massive sky-scraping silo, then how can you imagine anything else?</p>



<p>The answer isn’t to make everyone learn about how the original protocols were designed to separate key functions and the power that goes with them (though that’s certainly good to <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4216/Designing-an-Internet" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">know</a>). It’s to change how we feel and react to living inside a complex system that needs our care. Tech toxicity stems from there being only one business model for <em>how to internet</em>: concentration, surveillance, control. Further centralizing and managing this broken system will only make it worse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rewilding the internet is not a nostalgia project for middle-aged nerds who miss IRC and Usenet. For many people across the generations today, platforms like Facebook or TikTok <em>are</em> the internet. They’ve long dwelled in walled gardens they think are the world. Concentrated digital power produces the same symptoms that command and control produces in biological ecosystems; acute distress punctuated by sudden collapses once tipping points are reached. Rewilding is a way to collectively see the counterintuitive truth; today’s internet isn’t <em>too wild</em>, even if it feels like that. It’s simply not wild <em>enough.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s important to share that ecological rewilding is a work in progress. What do you rewild <em>to</em>? Humans have shaped and cultivated landscapes for tens of thousands of years, so what does “wild” even mean? Just as there’s no ecosystem on Earth untouched by human actions, there’s no “true” wildness to return habitats to. And what scale is needed for rewilding to succeed? It’s one thing to <a href="https://www.yellowstonepark.com/things-to-do/wildlife/wolf-reintroduction-changes-ecosystem/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">reintroduce</a> wolves to the 3,472 square miles of Yellowstone, quite another to cordon off about 20 square miles of a reclaimed polder near Amsterdam. Large and diverse Yellowstone is likely complex enough to adapt to change, but the small Dutch reserve known as Oostvaardersplassen has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/21/pioneering-dutch-rewilding-project-oostvaardersplassen-works-to-rebuild-controversial-reputation-aoe" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">struggled</a>.</p>

      “For tech giants, the long period of open internet evolution is over. Their internet is not an ecosystem. It’s a zoo.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>




<p>In the 1980s, the Dutch government attempted to regenerate a section of the overgrown Oostvaardersplassen. An independent-minded government ecologist, Frans Vera, said reeds and scrub would dominate unless now-extinct herbivores grazed them. In place of ancient aurochs, the state forest management agency introduced the <a href="https://www.popsci.com/nazi-bred-cows-are-too-ferocious-farm/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">famously bad-tempered</a> German Heck cattle, and in place of an extinct steppe pony, a Polish semi-feral breed.</p>



<p>Some 30 years on, with no natural predators, and after plans for a wildlife corridor to another reserve came to nothing, there were many more animals than the limited winter vegetation could sustain. People were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/27/dutch-rewilding-experiment-backfires-as-thousands-of-animals-starve" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">horrified</a> by starving cows and ponies, and beginning in 2018, government agencies instituted animal welfare checks and culling or removals.</p>



<p>Just turning the clock back was insufficient. The segment of Oostvaardersplassen was too small and too disconnected to be rewilded. Its effectively landlocked status made over-grazing and collapse inevitable, an embarrassing but necessary lesson. Rewilding is a work in progress. It’s not about trying to revert ecosystems to a mythical Eden. Instead, rewilders seek to rebuild resilience by restoring autonomous natural processes and letting them operate at scale to generate complexity. But rewilding, itself a human intervention, can take several turns to get right. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Whatever we do, the internet isn’t returning to old-school then-common interfaces like FTP and Gopher, or each organization running its own mail server, rather than operating off G-Suite. But shifting baselines mean that everyone using it today needs a shared way to articulate what’s happening, and a collective sense of purpose and possibility.</p>



<p>Some of what we need is already here, especially on the web. Look at the resurgence of RSS feeds, email newsletters and blogs as we discover (yet again) that relying on one app to host global conversations creates a single point of failure and control. New systems are growing, like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24063290/fediverse-explained-activitypub-social-media-open-protocol" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Fediverse</a> with its federated islands, or Bluesky with <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-30-2023-algorithmic-choice" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">algorithmic choice</a> and <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-13-2023-moderation" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">composable moderation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We don’t know what the future holds. Our job is to keep open as much opportunity as we can, trusting that those who come later will use it. Rewilding gets this. Instead of setting purity tests for which kind of internet is most like the original, we can test changes against the values of the original design.&nbsp; Do new standards protect the network’s “generality,” i.e. its ability to support multiple uses, or is functionality limited to optimize efficiency for the biggest tech firms? The internet is the technological expression of hard-won human wisdom; general-purpose systems are the most resilient, and it’s risky to concentrate information and control.</p>



<p>Ecologists also know that <strong>complexity is not the enemy, it’s the goal. </strong>The story of scientific forestry shows the conflict isn’t just between duopoly platforms and everyone else; it’s between a brittle, command-and-control mentality, and the ability to have faith in complex systems that may produce things you didn’t foresee for people you don’t control.</p>



<p>As early as 1985, plant ecologists Steward T.A. Pickett and Peter S. White <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780125545204/the-ecology-of-natural-disturbance-and-patch-dynamics#book-info" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in “The Ecology of Natural Disturbance and Patch Dynamics,” that “[an] essential paradox of wilderness conservation is that we seek to preserve what must change.” Some internet engineers know this. David Clark, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who worked on some of the internet’s earliest protocols, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262547703/designing-an-internet/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> an entire book about other network architectures that might have been built, if different values, like security or centralized management, had been prioritized by the internet’s creators.</p>



<p>But our internet took off because it was designed as a general-purpose network, built to connect anyone. Our internet was built to be complex and unbiddable, to do things we cannot yet imagine. When we interviewed Clark for rewilding project, he told us that “‘complex’ implies a system in which you have emergent behavior, a system in which you can’t model the outcomes. Your intuitions may be wrong. But a system that’s too simple means lost opportunities.”<sup> </sup>Or, as Daigle wrote in that 2019 <a href="https://www.thinkingcat.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2019-InvariantsUpdated.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">policy brief</a>, “simplicity is not always the best outcome.” Everything worthwhile we collectively make is complex or, honestly, messy. The cracks are where new people and ideas get in.</p>



<p>Internet infrastructure is a degraded ecosystem, but it’s also a built environment, like a city. Its complexity and unpredictability make it generative, worthwhile and deeply human. In 1961, Jane Jacobs, an American-Canadian activist and author of “The Death and Life of Great American Cities,” <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/86058/the-death-and-life-of-great-american-cities-by-jane-jacobs/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">argued</a> that mixed-use neighborhoods were safer, happier, more prosperous, and <a href="https://savingplaces.org/stories/a-tale-of-two-planners-jane-jacobs-and-robert-moses" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">more livable than</a> the sterile, highly controlling designs of urban planners like New York’s Robert Moses.</p>

      “Crashes, fires and floods may simply be entropy in action, but systemically concentrated and risky infrastructures are choices made manifest —&nbsp;and we can make better ones.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>




<p>Both Jacobs and the anthropologist Scott showed that top-down planning is often disastrous because instead of setting the stage for generative interactions it tries to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-09/robert-moses-and-his-racist-parkway-explained" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">control</a> what people will do. Just like the crime-ridden, Corbusier-like towers Moses crammed people into when he demolished mixed-use neighborhoods and built highways through them, today’s top-down, concentrated internet is, for many, an unpleasant and harmful place. Its owners are hard to remove, and their interests do not align with ours.</p>



<p>As Jacobs wrote: “As in all Utopias, the right to have plans of any significance belonged only to the planners in charge.”<sup> </sup>As a top-down, built environment, the internet has become something that is done to us, not something we collectively remake every day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an ecosystem, everything <a href="https://berjon.com/internet-transition/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">is infrastructure for</a> everything else. Ecosystems endure because species serve as checks and balances on each other. They have different modes of interaction, not just extraction, but mutualism, commensalism, competition and predation. In flourishing ecosystems, predators are subject to <a href="https://www.livingwithwolves.org/wolf-science-weekly/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">limits</a>. They’re just one part of a complex web that passes calories around, not a one-way ticket to the end of evolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ecologists know that <strong>diversity is resilience</strong>.</p>



<p>On July 18, 2001, 11 carriages of a 60-car freight train <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/RAB0408.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">derailed</a> in the Howard Street Tunnel under Mid-Town Belvedere, a neighborhood just north of downtown Baltimore. Within minutes one carriage containing a highly flammable chemical was punctured. The escaping chemical ignited and soon adjacent carriages were alight in a fire that took about five days to put out. The disaster multiplied and spread. Thick, brick tunnel walls <a href="https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=900095" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">acted like</a> an oven, and temperatures rose to nearly 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. A more than three-foot-wide water main above the tunnels burst, flooding the tunnel with millions of gallons within hours. It only cooled a little. Three weeks later, an explosion <a href="https://mde.maryland.gov/programs/pressroom/Pages/436.aspx" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">linked</a> to the combustible chemical <a href="https://www.bullsheet.com/bullsheet.com/tunnelfire.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">blew out</a> manhole covers located as far as two miles away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WorldCom, then the second largest long-distance phone company in the U.S., had fiber-optic cables in the tunnel carrying high volumes of phone and internet traffic. However, according to&nbsp; Clark, WorldCom’s resilience planning meant traffic was spread over different fiber networks in anticipation of just this kind of event.</p>



<p>On paper, Worldcom had network redundancy. But almost immediately, U.S. internet traffic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/20/us/fire-in-baltimore-snarls-internet-traffic-too.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">slowed</a>, and WorldCom’s East Coast and transatlantic phone lines went down. The region’s narrow physical topography had concentrated all those different fiber networks into a single chokepoint, the Howard Street Tunnel. WorldCom’s resilience was, quite literally, incinerated. It had technological redundancy, but not diversity. Sometimes we don’t notice concentration until it’s too late.
          </p>
        



<p>Clark tells the story of the Howard Street Tunnel fire to show that bottlenecks aren’t always obvious, especially at the operational level, and huge systems that seem secure due to their size and resources, can unexpectedly crumble.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In today’s internet, much traffic <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-amazon-meta-and-microsoft-weave-a-fiber-optic-web-of-power-11642222824" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">passes</a> through tech firms’ private networks, for example, Google and Meta’s own undersea cables. Much internet traffic is served from a few dominant content distribution networks, like Cloudflare and Akamai, who run their own networks of proxy servers and data centers. Similarly, that traffic goes through an increasingly small number of domain name system (DNS) resolvers, which work like phone books for the internet, linking website names to their numeric address.</p>



<p>All of this improves network speed and efficiency but creates new and non-obvious bottlenecks like the Howard Street Tunnel. Centralized service providers say they’re better resourced and skilled at attacks and failures, but they are also large, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23738871.2020.1728355" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">attractive targets</a> for attackers and possible single points of system failure.</p>



<p>On Oct. 21, 2016, dozens of major U.S. websites suddenly stopped working. Domain names belonging to Airbnb, Amazon, PayPal, CNN, The New York Times simply didn’t resolve. All were clients of the commercial DNS service provider, Dyn, which had been hit by a cyberattack. Hackers infected <a href="https://coverlink.com/case-study/mirai-ddos-attack-on-dyn/#:~:text=Impacted%20internet%20platforms%20included%20PayPal,platforms%20in%20approximately%20two%20hours" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">tens of thousands</a> of internet-enabled devices with malicious software, creating a network of hijacked devices, or a botnet, that they used to bombard Dyn with queries until it collapsed. America’s biggest internet brands were brought down, essentially, by a network of<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-day-of-the-zombie-baby-monitors-when-hackers-weaponized-the-internet-of-things/2016/10/25/167fdf42-9a1b-11e6-b3c9-f662adaa0048_story.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"> baby monitors</a>. Although they all likely had resilience planning and redundancies, they went down because a single chokepoint — in one crucial layer of infrastructure — failed.</p>



<p>Consolidation drives fragility. It imposes narrowness. Arranging deliberately varied networks and services into centralized stovepipes means we repeatedly fail to think of the internet as a complex system. Just like the train crash that caused a chemical leak that resulted in burst water pipes, melted fiber-optic cables and blown up manholes, single points of failure in complex critical systems have wide, unpredictable and devastating effects.</p>

<p>Widespread outages due to centralized chokepoints have become so common that investors even use them to identify opportunities. When a failure by cloud provider Fastly took high-profile websites offline in 2021, its share price <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4c68df91-98d1-4942-87cf-f734ea2cdd73" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">surged</a>. Investors were delighted by headlines that informed them of an obscure technical service provider with an apparent lock on an essential service.<sup> </sup>To investors, this critical infrastructure failure doesn’t look like fragility but like a chance to profit.</p>



<p>The result of infrastructural narrowness is baked-in fragility that we only notice after a breakdown. But monoculture is also highly visible in our search and browser tools. Search, browsing and social media are how we find and share knowledge, and how we communicate. They’re a critical, global epistemic and democratic infrastructure, controlled by just a few U.S. companies. Crashes, fires and floods may simply be entropy in action, but systemically concentrated and risky infrastructures are choices made manifest —&nbsp;and we can make better ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-the-look-feel-of-a-rewilded-internet"><strong>The Look &amp; Feel Of A Rewilded Internet</strong></h2>



<p>A rewilded internet will have many more service choices. Some services like search and social media will be broken up, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/what-att-breakup-teaches-us-about-big-tech-breakup" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">as AT&amp;T eventually was</a>. Instead of tech firms extracting and selling people’s personal data, different payment models will fund the infrastructure we need. Right now, there is little explicit provision for public goods like protocols and browsers, essential to making the internet work. The biggest tech firms subsidize and profoundly influence them.</p>



<p>Part of rewilding means taking what’s been pulled inside the big tech stack out of it, and paying for the true costs of connectivity. Some things like basic connectivity we will continue to pay for directly, and others like browsers we will support indirectly but transparently, as described below. The rewilded internet will have an abundance of ways to connect and relate to each other. There won’t be just one or two numbers to call if leaders of a political coup decide to shut the internet down in the middle of the night, as has happened in places like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/29/technology/internet/29cutoff.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Egypt</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/MYANMAR-POLITICS/INTERNET-RESTRICTION/rlgpdbreepo/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Myanmar</a>. No one entity will permanently be on top. A rewilded internet will be a more interesting, usable, stable and enjoyable place to be.</p>



<p>Through extensive research, Nobel-winning economist Elinor Ostrom <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959378010000634" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">found</a> that “when individuals are well informed about the problem they face and about who else is involved, and can build settings where trust and reciprocity can emerge, grow, and be sustained over time, costly and positive actions are frequently taken without waiting for an external authority to impose rules, monitor compliance, and assess penalties.” Ostrom <a href="https://www.yesmagazine.org/economy/2021/08/11/the-commons-lobster-maine-elinor-ostrom" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">found</a> people spontaneously organizing to manage natural resources —&nbsp;from water company cooperation in California to Maine lobster fishermen monitoring each other and repelling outsiders to prevent over-fishing.</p>



<p>Self-organization also exists as part of a key internet function: traffic coordination. Internet exchange points (<a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/issues/ixps/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">IXPs</a>) are an example of common-pool resource management, where internet service providers (ISPs) collectively agree to carry each other’s data for low or no cost. Network operators of all kinds — telecoms companies, large tech firms, universities, governments and broadcasters — all need to send large amounts of data through other ISPs’ networks so that it gets to its destination.</p>



<p>If they managed this separately through individual contracts, they’d spend much more time and money. Instead, they often form IXPs, typically as independent, not-for-profit associations. As well as managing traffic, IXPs have, in many — and especially developing — countries, formed the backbone of a flourishing technical community that further drives economic development.</p>



<p>Both between people and on the internet, connections are generative. From technical standards to common-pool resource management and even to more localized broadband networks known as “altnets,” internet rewilding already has a deep toolbox of collective action ready to be deployed.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-road-to-rewilding"><strong>The Road To Rewilding</strong></h2>



<p>The list of infrastructures to be diversified is long; as well as pipes and protocols, there are operating systems, browsers, search engines, DNS, social media, advertising, cloud providers, app stores, AI companies and more. Not only are the technologies involved complex, but they’re also intertwined. But freedoms are additive. Showing what can be done in one area creates opportunities in others. First, let’s start with regulation.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-new-drive-for-antitrust-competition"><strong>The New Drive For Antitrust &amp; Competition</strong></h2>



<p>You don’t always need a big new idea like rewilding to frame and motivate major structural change. Sometimes reviving an old idea will do. President Biden’s 2021 “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Executive Order</a> on Promoting Competition in the American Economy” revived the original, pro-worker, trust-busting scope and urgency of the early 20th-century legal activist and Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis, along with rules and framings that date back to before the 1930s New Deal.</p>

      “Rewilding an already built environment isn’t just sitting back and seeing what tender, living thing can force its way through the concrete. It’s razing to the ground the structures that block out light for everyone not rich enough to live on the top floor.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>




<p>U.S. antitrust law was <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/11/how-gilded-age-lawmakers-saved-america-from-plutocracy/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">created</a> to break the power of oligarchs in oil, steel and railroads who threatened America’s young democracy. It gave workers basic protections and saw equal economic opportunity as essential to freedom. This expansive and interdependent view of competition and antitrust as essential for fairness and democracy was <a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/BFI_WP_2022-104.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">whittled away</a> by Chicago School economists’ policies in the 1970s and Regan-era judges’ court rulings over the decades and <a href="https://lawreview.uchicago.edu/print-archive/chicago-school-and-forgotten-political-dimension-antitrust-law" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">sidelined</a> by the narrow economic doctrine that intervention is only permitted when monopoly power causes consumer prices to rise. The intellectual monoculture of the consumer harm threshold has since spread globally.</p>



<p>It’s why governments just stood aside as 21st-century tech firms romped to oligopoly. If a regulator’s sole criterion for action is to make sure consumers don’t pay a penny more, then the free or data-subsidized services of tech platforms don’t even register. (Of course, consumers pay in other ways, as these tech giants exploit their personal information for profit.) This laissez-faire approach allowed the biggest firms to choke off competition by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-27/big-tech-goes-on-shopping-spree-brushing-off-antitrust-scrutiny" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">acquiring</a> their competitors and vertically integrating service providers, creating the problems we have today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regulators and enforcers in Washington and Brussels now say they have learned that lesson and won’t allow AI dominance to happen as internet concentration did. Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan and U.S. Department of Justice antitrust <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/technology/jonathan-kanter-apple-antitrust.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">enforcer</a>, Jonathan Kanter, are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/28/23660101/ai-competition-ftc-doj-lina-khan-jonathan-kanter-antitrust-summit" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">identifying</a> chokepoints in the AI “<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-jonathan-kanter-delivers-remarks-22nd-international" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">stack</a>” —&nbsp;concentration in control of processing chips, datasets, computing capacity, algorithm innovation, distribution platforms and user interfaces —&nbsp;and analyzing each potential bottleneck to see if it affects systemic competition. This is potentially good news for people who want to prevent the current dominance of tech giants being grandfathered into our AI future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his 2021 signing of the executive order on competition, President Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/07/09/remarks-by-president-biden-at-signing-of-an-executive-order-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">said</a>, “capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism; it’s exploitation.” Biden’s enforcers are changing the kinds of cases they take up and widening the applicable legal theories on harm that they bring to judges. Instead of the traditionally narrow focus on consumer prices, today’s cases argue that the economic harms perpetrated by dominant firms include those suffered by their workers, small companies and the market as a whole.</p>



<p>Khan and Kanter have jettisoned narrow and abstruse models of market behavior for real-world experiences of healthcare workers, farmers, writers. They <em>get</em> that shutting off economic opportunity fuels far-right extremism. They’ve made antitrust enforcement and competition policy explicitly about coercion versus choice, power versus democracy. Kanter <a href="https://bruxconference2024.clevercast.com/webcast/w-qodbzp/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">told</a> a recent conference in Brussels that “excessive concentration of power is a threat … it’s not just about prices or output but it’s about freedom, liberty and opportunity.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enforcers in Washington and Brussels are starting to preemptively block tech firms from using dominance in one realm to take over another. After scrutiny by the U.S. FTC and European Commission, Amazon recently <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68131819" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">abandoned</a> its plan to acquire the home appliance manufacturer, iRobot. Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have also moved to stop Apple from using its iPhone platform dominance to squeeze app store competition and dominate future markets through, for example, pushing the usage of CarPlay on automakers and limiting access to its tap-to-pay digital wallet in the financial services sector.</p>



<p>Still, so far, their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/04/technology/europe-apple-meta-google-microsoft.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">enforcement actions</a> have focused on the consumer-facing, highly visible parts of the tech giants’ exploitative and proprietary internet. The few, narrow measures of the 2021 executive order that aim to reduce infrastructure-based monopolies, only prevent <em>future </em>abuses like radio spectrum-hogging, not those already <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/mbjpjb/a-short-history-of-wireless-spectrum-the-most-complicated-puzzle-youve-ever-seen" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">locked in</a>. Sure, the best way to deal with monopolies is to stop them from happening in the first place. But unless regulators and enforcers eradicate the existing dominance of these giants now, we’ll be living in today’s infrastructure monopoly for decades, perhaps even a century.</p>



<p>Just imagine applying Khan and Kanter’s chokepoint identification and whole-system harms investigation to the internet’s <em>invisible</em> layers —&nbsp;and doing so today. Just imagine what the future possibilities for internet innovation could be if “capitalism without competition” was rooted out all the way up and down the stack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The recent return to more muscular competition enforcement still isn’t radical enough. So far, even activist regulators have shied away from applying the toughest remedies for concentration in long-consolidated markets, such as non-discrimination requirements, functional interoperability and structural separations, i.e. breaking companies up. And talk of declaring the so-called “<a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/big-tech-s-natural-monopoly-tough-to-self-regulate-malone-says-1.1679411" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">natural monopolies</a>” in search and social media to be <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/no-facebook-google-not-public-utilities/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">public utilities</a> — and forcing them to act as common carriers open to all — is still too extreme for most.</p>



<p>But taken together, these are some of the most powerful tools we have to rewild the internet’s silent and existing vertical integrations; its deliberately moated fiefdoms squatting on bottlenecks of critical national and global infrastructure. Rewilding an already built environment isn’t just sitting back and seeing what tender, living thing can force its way through the concrete. It’s razing to the ground the structures that block out light for everyone not rich enough to live on the top floor.</p>

      “Regulators’ efforts to make the visible internet competitive will achieve little unless they also tackle the devastation that lies beneath.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>




<p>When the writer and activist Cory Doctorow <a href="https://www.noemamag.com/freeing-ourselves-from-the-clutches-of-big-tech/" data-wpel-link="internal">wrote</a> about how to free ourselves from the clutches of Big Tech, he said that though breaking up big companies will likely take decades, providing strong and mandatory interoperability would open up innovative space and slow the flow of money to the largest firms — money they would otherwise use to deepen their moats. </p>



<p>Doctorow describes “comcom,” or competitive compatibility, as a kind of “guerrilla interoperability, achieved through reverse engineering, bots, scraping and other permissionless tactics.” Before a thicket of invasive laws sprung up to strangle it, comcom was just how people figured out how to fix cars and tractors or re-write software. Comcom drives the try-every-tactic-until-one-works behavior you see in a flourishing ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an ecosystem, diversity of species is another way of saying “diversity of tactics,” as each successful new tactic creates a new niche to occupy. Whether it’s an octopus camouflaging itself as a sea snake, a cuckoo smuggling her chicks into another bird’s nest, orchids producing flowers that look just like a female bee, or parasites influencing rodent hosts to take life-ending risks, each evolutionary micro-niche is created by a successful tactic. Comcom is simply tactical diversity; it’s how organisms interact in complex, dynamic systems. And humans have demonstrated the epitome of short-term thinking by enabling the oligarchs who are trying to end it.</p>



<p>Efforts are underway. The EU already has several years of experience with interoperability mandates and precious insight into how determined firms work to circumvent such laws. The U.S., however, is still in its early days of ensuring software interoperability, for example, for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/8/24119268/wyden-secure-interoperable-goverment-collaboration-technology-act-encryption" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">videoconferencing</a>.”</p>



<p>Perhaps one way to motivate and encourage regulators and enforcers everywhere is to explain that the subterranean architecture of the internet has become a shadowland where evolution has all but stopped. Regulators’ efforts to make the visible internet competitive will achieve little unless they also tackle the devastation that lies beneath.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-next-steps"><strong>Next Steps</strong></h2>



<p>Much of what we need is already here. Beyond regulators digging deep for courage, vision and bold new litigation strategies, we need vigorous, pro-competitive government policies around procurement, investments and physical infrastructure, that require interoperability at every level and the resources to make it happen. Universities must reject research <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/06/academic-research-meta-google-university-influence/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">funding from tech firms</a> because it always comes with conditions, both spoken <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/12/04/tech/facebook-disinformation-whistleblower/index.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">and</a> <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/2019/06/how-big-tech-funds-debate-ai-ethics" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">unspoken</a>.</p>



<p>Instead, we need more public-funded tech research with publicly released findings aimed at serving the collective good. Such research should investigate power concentration in the internet ecosystem and practical alternatives to it. We need to recognize that much of the internet’s infrastructure is a de facto utility, that any monopolies are critical public resources that we must regain control of.</p>



<p>We must ensure regulatory and financial incentives and support for alternatives including common-pool resource management, community networks, and the myriad other collaborative mechanisms people have always used to provide essential public goods like clean water, roads and defense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All this takes money. Governments are starved of tax revenue by the once-in-history windfalls seized by today’s tech giants, so it’s clear where the money is. We need to get it back. We need to stop talking about ethics and hoping the next generation will do a better job and start making demands of <em>power</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know all this, but still find it so hard to collectively act. Why?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Herded into rigid tech plantations rather than functioning, diverse ecosystems, it’s tough to imagine alternatives. Even those who can see clearly may feel helpless and alone. Rewilding unites everything we know we need to do and brings with it a whole new toolbox and vision.</p>



<p>Ecologists face the same systems of exploitation and are organizing urgently, at scale and across domains. They <a href="https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2023/12/08/inside-the-rewilding-movement" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">see clearly</a> that the issues aren’t isolated but are instances of the same pathology of command and control, extraction and domination that political anthropologist Scott first noticed in scientific forestry. The solutions are the same in ecology and technology; aggressively use the rule of law to level out unequal capital and power, then rush in to fill the gaps with better ways of doing things.</p>



<h2 id="h-keep-the-internet-the-internet"><strong>Keep The Internet, The Internet</strong></h2>



<p>Susan Leigh Star, a sociologist and theorist of infrastructure and networks, wrote in her 1999 influential paper, “The Ethnography of Infrastructure”:</p>



<p>“Study a city and neglect its sewers and power supplies (as many have), and you miss essential aspects of distributional justice and planning power. Study an information system and neglect its standards, wires, and settings, and you miss equally essential aspects of aesthetics, justice, and change.”</p>

      “If fundamental internet protocols don’t maximize the values of interoperability, generality and openness, then they’re simply not the internet.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>




<p>The technical protocols and standards that underlie the internet’s infrastructure are ostensibly developed in open, collaborative SDOs, but are also increasingly under the control of a few companies; so what appear to be “voluntary” standards are often the business choices of the biggest firms.</p>



<p>The dominance of SDOs by big firms also shapes what does <em>not</em> get standardized — for example, search, which is effectively a global monopoly. While efforts to directly <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-nottingham-avoiding-internet-centralization-02.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">address</a> internet consolidation have been raised <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/pdf/draft-mcfadden-cnsldtn-effects-01" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">repeatedly</a> within SDOs, little progress has been made. This is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/investigation-into-googles-privacy-sandbox-browser-changes" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">damaging</a> SDOs’ credibility, especially outside the U.S. SDOs must radically change or they will lose their implicit global mandate to steward the future of the internet.</p>



<p>We need internet standards to be global, open and generative. They’re the wire models that give the internet its planetary form, the gossamer-thin but steely-strong threads holding together its interoperability against fragmentation and permanent dominance. We need them to work. As internet engineer Jari Arkko <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23738871.2020.1740753?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">put it</a> in 2020, for the health of the network and all our security, SDOs must “ensure that key aspects of the evolving internet stay open, e.g. through open, standardized interfaces and that open source continues to be an important building block.” If fundamental internet protocols don’t maximize the values of interoperability, generality and openness, then they’re simply not the internet.</p>



<h2 id="h-make-laws-standards-work-together"><strong><strong>Make Laws &amp; Standards Work Together</strong></strong></h2>



<p>In 2018, a small group of Californians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/13/business/california-data-privacy-ballot-measure.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">maneuvered</a> the California Legislature into passing the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa#:~:text=The%20California%20Consumer%20Privacy%20Act,how%20to%20implement%20the%20law." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> (CCPA). Nested in the statute was an unassuming provision, the “right to opt out of sale or sharing” your personal information via a “user-enabled global privacy control” or GPC signal that would create an automated method for doing so. The law didn’t define how GPC might work. As a technical standard was required for browsers, businesses and providers to speak the same language, the signal’s details were delegated to a group of experts.</p>



<p>In July 2021, California’s Attorney General <a href="https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/2021/07/15/california-attorney-general-updates-ccpa-faqs-indicating-mandatory-compliance-with-global-privacy-control/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">mandated</a> that all businesses use the newly created GPC for California-based consumers visiting their websites. The group of experts is now <a href="https://w3cping.github.io/administrivia/2023/charter.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">shepherding</a> the technical specification through global web standards development at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). For California residents, GPC automates the request to “accept” or “reject” sales of your data, such as cookie-based tracking,&nbsp; on its websites; however, it isn’t yet supported by major default browsers like Chrome and Safari. Broad adoption will take time, but it’s a small step in changing real-world outcomes by driving antimonopoly practices deep into the standards stack — and it’s already being <a href="https://usercentrics.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-global-privacy-control/#:~:text=United%20States%20and%20state%2Dlevel%20laws%20and%20GPC,-Six%20new%20data&amp;text=The%20laws%20in%20California%2C%20Connecticut,to%20respect%20Global%20Privacy%20Control." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">adopted</a> elsewhere.</p>



<p>GPC is not the first legally mandated open standard, but it was deliberately designed from day one to bridge policymaking and standards-setting. The standard provides a mechanism and the law makes it mandatory. It’s a powerful dynamic where all play to their strengths. The idea is gaining ground. A recent United Nations Human Rights Council <a href="https://documents.un.org/doc/undoc/gen/g23/117/05/pdf/g2311705.pdf?token=2yMgO0WoPF6QcYggQX&amp;fe=true" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">report</a> recommends that states delegate “regulatory functions to standard-setting organizations.” Our technical standards can be crossbred with institutions to produce protocols for governance that let people shape their online world.</p>



<h2 id="h-make-service-providers-not-users-transparent"><strong>Make Service-Providers — Not Users — Transparent</strong></h2>



<p>Today’s internet offers minimal transparency of key internet infrastructure providers. For example, browsers are highly complex pieces of infrastructure that determine how billions of people use the web, yet they are provided for free. That’s because the most commonly used search engines enter into opaque financial deals with browsers, paying them to be set as the default. Since few people change their default search engine, browsers like Safari and Firefox <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johanmoreno/2021/08/27/google-estimated-to-be-paying-15-billion-to-remain-default-search-engine-on-safari/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">make money</a> by defaulting the search bar to Google, locking in its dominance even as the search engine’s quality of output <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/09/google-search-size-usefulness-decline/675409/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">declines</a>.</p>



<p>This creates a quandary. If antitrust enforcers were to impose competition, browsers would lose their main source of income. Infrastructure requires money, but the planetary nature of the internet challenges our public funding model, leaving the door open to private capture. However, if we see the current opaque system as what it is, a kind of non-state taxation, then we can craft an alternative.</p>



<p>Search engines are a logical place for governments to mandate the collection of a levy that supports browsers and other key internet infrastructure, which could be financed transparently, under open, transnational, multistakeholder oversight. &nbsp;Imagining new institutional methods to solve old problems at a global scale is one way to rewild the web.</p>

<h2 id="h-make-space-to-grow"><strong>Make Space To Grow</strong></h2>



<p>We need to stop thinking of internet infrastructure as too hard to fix. It’s the underlying system we use for nearly everything we do. The former prime minister of Sweden, Carl Bildt, and former Canadian deputy foreign minister, Gordon Smith <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23738871.2016.1235908" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in 2016 that the internet was becoming “the infrastructure of all infrastructure.”<sup> </sup>It’s how we organize, connect and build knowledge, even — perhaps — planetary intelligence. Right now, it’s concentrated, fragile and utterly toxic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ecologists have re-oriented their field as a “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1600-0498.12149" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">crisis discipline</a>,” a field of study that’s not just about learning things but about saving them. We technologists need to do the same. Rewilding the internet connects and grows what people are doing across regulation, standards-setting and new ways of organizing and building infrastructure, to tell a shared story of where we want to go. It’s a shared vision with many strategies. The instruments we need to shift away from extractive technological monocultures are at hand or ready to be built.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as a diverse “<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/09/tiny-urban-forests-miyawaki-biodiversity-carbon-capture/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">pocket forest</a>” is the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354231796_Between_Pocket_Forest_Wilderness_and_Restored_Rural_Arcadia_Optimizing_the_Use_of_a_Feral_Woodland_Enclave_in_Urban_Environment" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">surest</a> way to regenerate urban vegetation, a global network with multiple different ways “to internet” is the best insurance policy for future innovation and resilience. We need to rewild the internet for the future, for our freedom to build tools and spaces, and to share knowledge, ideas and stories that haven’t been anticipated by the internet’s current overlords and cannot be contained.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The quadratic complexity and weak length extrapolation of Transformers limits their ability to scale to long sequences, and while sub-quadratic solutions like linear attention and state space models exist, they empirically underperform Transformers in pretraining efficiency and downstream task accuracy. We introduce Megalodon, a neural architecture for efficient sequence modeling with unlimited context length. Megalodon inherits the architecture of Mega (exponential moving average with gated attention), and further introduces multiple technical components to improve its capability and stability, including complex exponential moving average (CEMA), timestep normalization layer, normalized attention mechanism and pre-norm with two-hop residual configuration. In a controlled head-to-head comparison with Llama2, Megalodon achieves better efficiency than Transformer in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training tokens. Megalodon reaches a training loss of 1.70, landing mid-way between Llama2-7B (1.75) and 13B (1.67).

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.spice-space.org/usbredir.html">https://www.spice-space.org/usbredir.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40054580">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    
    <p>usbredir is the name of a network protocol for sending USB device
traffic over a network connection. It is also the name of the software
package offering a parsing library, a usbredirhost library and several
utilities implementing this protocol.</p>
<p>The protocol is documented
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spice/usbredir/raw/master/usb-redirection-protocol.txt">here</a>,
this document also explains what is meant with a usbhost and a usbguest.</p>
<p>usbredir was created for use with Spice, which is why it is hosted on
spice-space.org, but the protocol and the usbredirhost are completely
independent of spice, they could for example also be used to create a
vnc extension for redirecting USB devices over a vnc connection to a
qemu virtual machine.</p>
<p>The usbguest side is currently only implemented for qemu, and shipped as
part of qemu (enabling this in qemu requires the libusbredirparser
library to be available when building qemu).</p>
<p>usbredir supports USB device filtering configurable by a filter string</p>
<div id="host-configuration">
<h2>Host Configuration</h2>
<p>For redirection to work, the virtual machine must have a supported USB
controller. Qemu supports both USB2 and USB3, but at the time of
writing, USB3 has had less testing. For USB2 support, the guest must
have a EHCI controller and companion UHCI controller (companion UHCI is needed
in order to support also USB1.x devices). For USB3 support, an XHCI controller
is required.
It also needs to have Spice channels for USB redirection. The number of such
channels determine the number of USB devices that it's possible to redirect at
the same time.</p>
<p>More information about USB controllers in qemu could be found
<a href="http://git.qemu-project.org/?p=qemu.git;a=blob_plain;f=docs/usb2.txt;hb=HEAD">here</a>.</p>
<div id="using-virt-manager">
<h3>Using virt-manager</h3>
<p>Virtual machines created with virt-manager should have a USB controller
by default. In the virtual machine details, select "Controller USB" in
the left pane. If you only need to support USB2 devices, make sure its
model is set to "USB2". For USB 3.0 support, select "USB3" for the
model type.</p>
<p>You can then click on "Add Hardware" and add "USB Redirection" items as the
number of USB devices you want to be able to redirect simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div id="using-libvirt">

<div id="client-configuration">
<h2>Client Configuration</h2>
<p>The client needs to have support for USB redirection. In remote-viewer, you can
select which USB devices to redirect under the "File-&gt;USB device selection" menu
once the Spice connection is established. There are also various command line
redirection options which are described below and when running remote-viewer
with --help-spice.</p>
<p>To get USB redirection working on Windows clients, you need to install
<a href="https://www.spice-space.org/download/windows/usbdk/">UsbDk</a></p>
</div>
<div id="filter-string-format">
<h2>Filter String Format</h2>
<p>A filter is used to set blocking or autoconnect rules for USB devices. It
consists of one or more rules, where each rule has the form of:</p>
<p><strong>&lt;class&gt;,&lt;vendor&gt;,&lt;product&gt;,&lt;version&gt;,&lt;allow&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Use -1 for class/vendor/product/version to accept any value.</p>
<p>And the rules themselves are concatenated like this:</p>
<p><strong>rule1|rule2|rule3</strong></p>
<p>A client's default auto-connect filter string is 0x03,-1,-1,-1,0|-1,-1,-1,-1,1</p>
<p>This filters out HID (class 0x03) USB devices from auto connect and auto
connects anything else. Note the explicit allow rule at the end, this is
necessary since by default all devices without a matching filter rule will not
auto-connect.</p>
</div>
<div id="client-filtering">
<h2>Client Filtering</h2>
<p>Set a string specifying a filter to determine which USB devices, when plugged
in, are allowed/blocked to <strong>auto-redirect</strong> USB traffic to the guest (client's
window has to be in focus).</p>
<div><pre><span></span>remote-viewer<span> </span>--spice-usbredir-auto-redirect-filter<span>=</span><span>"0x03,-1,-1,-1,0|-1,-1,-1,-1,1"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Set a string specifying a filter to determine which USB devices, that are
already plugged in, to <strong>redirect on connect</strong> once Spice connection is
established.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>remote-viewer<span> </span>--spice-usbredir-redirect-on-connect<span>=</span><span>"0x03,-1,-1,-1,0|-1,-1,-1,-1,1"</span>
</pre></div>

<div id="host-filtering">
<h2>Host Filtering</h2>
<p>Set a string specifying a filter to determine which USB devices are
<strong>allowed/blocked</strong> to redirect USB traffic to the guest.</p>

<p>Note that in a QEMU command, the filter string should use a <strong>':'</strong> character as
a separator within the rule.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I, like many developers who have worked on high-scale, low-latency web services over the last fifteen years, have an intimate relationship with Redis. At any new job, when you ask where the data is, and someone points you to a server address with port <code>6379</code>, you know you will meet an good, reliable friend there.</p><p>When you shell into the redis box or container or pod, you know what you’re going to find. When you run <code>redis-cli</code>, and it, immediately, presents you with the <code>&gt;</code>, you know you’re ready to work. And, when it returns <code>PONG</code> to your <code>ping</code>, you are filled with a sense of ritualistic completion and assurance that it is as ready to read your code as you are to write it.</p><figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/main/static/images/redis_pong.png" width="400"></figure><p>I have been running ping now across countless Redis installs, across web services written in PHP, in Go, Java, in Python, (unfortunately) Scala, across industries, across space and time, across multiple products that <a href="https://www.anyscale.com/blog/redis-in-ray-past-and-future">use and have used</a> Redis as cache by default.</p><p>I, as a cynical Eastern European, <a href="https://vickiboykis.com/2021/09/23/reaching-mle-machine-learning-enlightenment/">hate almost everything in software</a>. But I love Redis with a loyalty that I reserve for close friends and family and the first true day of spring, because Redis is software made for me, the developer.</p><p>Everything about Redis is meant to empower, to clarify, to show, where abstractions need to be shown, and neatly tuck them away where they don’t. It is made to work, to handle my throughput and stay out of the way.</p><p>Even the documentation is written for developers who want to learn more, not to obscure or to sell.</p><figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/main/static/images/redis_fork.png" width="400"></figure><p>I used it at work, and I used it as my <a href="https://vickiboykis.com/2024/01/05/retro-on-viberary/">vector search engine in Viberary</a>, where it worked brilliantly and with extremely low latency out of the box. In a world full of junk, bloated, and obfuscated software, Redis just works. Or, as the best software developers I know would say,<a href="https://jawns.club/@vicki/111131219599273096"> it is elegant.</a></p><p>Unfortunately, my Redis <a href="https://andrewkelley.me/post/redis-renamed-to-redict.html">doesn’t make money</a>. While I was working on Viberary, I remarked to friends that Redis was a better vector store for probably 80% of use-cases than actual vector databases, and that it was a shame that the Redis Search module wasn’t well-known. Of course, in the heat of the generative AI landscape, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkey%27s_Paw">the monkey’s paw curled</a>, the over-leveraged business decided they needed to <a href="https://redis.io/press/redis-labs-secures-44-million-funding-led-goldman-sachs-private-capital-investing-strengthen-database-leadership/">actually make money</a>, and they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/redis-license-change-and-forking-are-a-mess-that-everybody-can-feel-bad-about/">changed the license</a>, ostensibly so that AWS and other large-scale cloud vendors couldn’t sell it as a product offering.</p><p>In a pattern that has previously happened for Elasticsearch and Terraform, and one that was extremely predictable, <a href="https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/966631/6bf2063136effa1e/">Redis is now forked at least three different ways</a> - the original Redis, now <a href="https://redis.io/blog/redis-adopts-dual-source-available-licensing/">no longer under BSD</a>, <a href="https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey">Valkey</a>, under BSD and led by previous contributors to Redis from AWS and other companies, and <a href="https://redict.io/">Redict</a>, under GPL, led by an open-source coalition. Both of these licenses allow commercial reuse.</p><p>The old Redis was for developers. The new Redis is for enterprise sales, and for <a href="https://redis.io/blog/the-future-of-redis/">generative AI</a>. It’s true that it’s not yet entirely clear what all of this means for the future of Redis the software. Some say the<a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3714688/the-bizarre-defense-of-trillion-dollar-cabals.html"> licensing changes won’t impact much</a> if you’re not a large-scale Redis reseller. Because it’s true that the license changes were all legal and all parties acted in accordance with both what’s acceptable and what the market dictates to sustain the software. And yet at the same time, projects that depend on <a href="https://github.com/alpinelinux/aports/commit/57959e206db177fb4c2c641dac24eb0bf1d528ae#diff-cbaca272b75bdb3596a5e2ddab75cf99bb95f420da9f2dbede1fff6148fe986fR5">Redis are withholding updates</a> or <a href="https://github.com/packit/deployment/issues/561">migrating.</a></p><p>But the problem is not only that the license changed suddenly, without warning, it’s the messaging behind the change, and the message is, even though there is extremely active community development, Redis is no longer in and of the community. We are <a href="https://www.ftrain.com/wwic">no longer being consulted.</a></p><p>As for the forks, there is no clear direction yet either. Valkey is on GitHub and already extremely active, yet there is already a debate about what <a href="https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/issues/18#issuecomment-2016683243">OSS means in the context of the fork</a>. Redict is entirely open but has opened contributions on Codeberg, where they are far from GitHub’s AI training data collection, but also miss out on the network effect for contribution in the GitHub social network, the friction of which can’t be underestimated.</p><p>All of this is very sad, because it’s not clear which path forward makes sense in this new landscape for me as a builder if I want to now use Redis in a new project, particularly since neither of the new projects support modules like <a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/interact/search-and-query/">Redis Search yet</a>. (Or if they do, it’s not clear to me whether it’s directly drop-in compatible and what the licensing issues are there.) It seems like the new, corporate Redis is no longer for me or my personal projects, which is ironic given that my interests lie squarely in the vector search and generative AI spaces. It’s also not clear if I wanted to contribute, which one I should give my time and energy into. So, it seems like I’ll be staying on the Redis available <a href="https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/13157">before this commit</a> for <a href="https://github.com/alpinelinux/aports/commit/57959e206db177fb4c2c641dac24eb0bf1d528ae#diff-cbaca272b75bdb3596a5e2ddab75cf99bb95f420da9f2dbede1fff6148fe986fR5">the time being</a>, until the dust settles.</p><p><a href="https://vickiboykis.com/essays/2017-05-10-good-things-dont-scale/">Good things don’t scale</a>, except in the case of Redis, where all it does scale in <code>O(1)</code> time, but doesn’t align with the realities of markets in software.</p><p>Fortunately, in redis/valkey/redict codebases, one thing that is still a constant is that whenever there is a ping, you can always expect a quiet, resounding pong, and in that regard, with the current energy around open-source, particularly in the ML space, I’m optimistic.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>If you're an organ donor in the U.S., there's a 25% chance your kidney ends up in the trash. Today's guests, </span><strong>Jennifer Erickson </strong><span>and </span><strong>Greg Segal</strong><span>, argue a government-enabled monopoly is the culprit.</span></p><p><span>We spoke with Erickson and Segal about how they successfully advocated for major fixes to the organ donation network. Erickson is a Senior Fellow with the </span><strong><a href="https://fas.org/expert/jennifer-erickson/" rel="">Federation of American Scientists</a></strong><a href="https://fas.org/expert/jennifer-erickson/" rel=""> </a><span>and former Assistant Director of Innovation for Growth in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Segal is the founder and CEO of </span><strong><a href="https://www.organize.org/about" rel="">Organize</a></strong><span>, a nonprofit patient advocacy group.&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><p><em>Why are 28,000 organs going untransplanted annually?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Why does 1% of the federal budget go to dialysis?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Why has a sole bidder run the U.S. transplant system for decades?</em></p></li></ul><p><em>[Thanks to Rita Sokolova for her judicious transcript edits.]</em></p><p><strong>Jennifer Erickson: </strong><span>What I will say out of the gate about the organ waiting list is that it alternatingly makes me want to turn over the table, it makes me so angry because it's unnecessary. But then also the great thing is, this is actually a healthcare problem that we can fix. The problem, it turns out, is actually the federal contractors.&nbsp;</span></p><p>So who are the contractors? First, there are 55 local contractors. These are called organ procurement organizations or OPOs. Some have a state as their donation service area, some are across part of a state.&nbsp;</p><p>Congress set up a monopoly contract in the eighties, called the Organ Procurement Transplantation Network, or OPTN. This national contract has only ever been held by one contractor, the United Network for Organ Sharing. If you've seen Grey's Anatomy or ER and they said “I need a heart, get UNOS on the phone,” that's UNOS.&nbsp;</p><p>Just one example again of how bad it is: Greg and I recently got a whistleblower call in the last heat wave. Someone took a liver, a human liver that a family said yes to on the worst day of their life because a loved one died in an accident, and left it at the wrong hospital’s cargo bay in 90 degree heat, and no one noticed for an hour and a half.&nbsp;</p><p>The OPTN has a board to set policy. Who's on the board right now? The current board, the board members of the nation's Organ Procurement Transplantation Network, were until recently the exact same board members for the contractor, UNOS. So, literally, they would meet on a Sunday as OPTN board members and then on a Monday as UNOS board members.</p><p>To say it's a conflict is an understatement: it's a Venn diagram that just is one circle. It's really, really bad. So as a first thing, this legacy board is still deciding policy for the nation. There are ongoing, bipartisan Congressional investigations into conflicts of interest and corruption.</p><p>The tech is so bad. The United States Digital Service found 17 days of downtime in recent years. Until recently, the algorithm that was protecting all organ donor patient information in the country, so STI status, mental health, every physical history, was from 1996.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a fixable problem: it’s about the contractor, supply chain, it’s logistics, transparency. Congress unanimously passed a bill in July. The only other thing that passed unanimously that day was Tony Bennett Day.</p><p>Senator Todd Young, a Republican from Indiana, who lost a friend waiting for a heart, has done a lot of oversight into OPOs, including the OPO in Indiana. And in one year of that oversight — this has been peer reviewed and published — organ donation in the state of Indiana went up by 44 percent. It went up by 44 percent because they approached 57 percent more families. What in the hell was that government contractor doing before Todd Young started asking questions?</p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> The predecessor organization to UNOS lobbied heavily to insert language into the National Organ Transplant Act (</span><strong><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/98th-congress/senate-bill/2048" rel="">NOTA</a></strong><span>) that stipulated that, to compete for this contract, a contractor has to be an independent nonprofit with expertise in organ donation and transplantation. </span><em>That phrase has always been interpreted to mean UNOS.</em><span> In 2018, the last time there was an open contracting cycle, you had to have </span><strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/for-the-first-time-in-years-new-groups-may-vie-to-run-organ-transplant-network/2018/04/23/a8b7eb3c-44ad-11e8-ad8f-27a8c409298b_story.html" rel="">three years of experience</a></strong><span> to even submit a bid to the federal government. Now, that might sound sensible until you realize that there’s a national monopoly and only one group has ever had three years of experience. So no one else applied.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The United States Digital Service produced a report called </span><em><strong><a href="https://thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/143-USDS-Report-Modernizing-OPTN-Jan-2021_Redacted70.pdf" rel="">Lives are at Stake</a></strong></em><span>, which is not a normal name for a government report. It's a way of writing it in flashing red letters. They identified that phrase in NOTA as one that has restricted competition across decades, and in the summer of 2023, both the Senate and the House unanimously passed the </span><strong><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2544" rel="">Securing the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network Act</a></strong><span>, which removed it.

That put it into technicolor for us that we had not only a preventable, outrageous tragedy and a responsibility to actually fix it and prevent it. Greg and the researchers that he worked with showed that there are 17,500 kidneys, 7,500 livers, 1,500 hearts, and 1,500 lungs that go untransplanted every year from potential American organ donors. For scale, that means the United States does not need to have a waiting list for livers, hearts, or lungs within three years, and the kidney waiting list should come way down. That data convinced not only the Obama administration, but also the Trump administration. This reform movement has now crossed three administrations, and that almost never happens.</span></p><p><strong>Greg Segal:</strong><span> So our organization, </span><strong><a href="https://www.organize.org/about" rel="">Organize</a></strong><span>, was awarded the Innovator in Residence position in the secretary's office of the </span><strong><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/" rel="">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a></strong><span> (HHS) from 2015 to 2016. We were still technically a non-governmental nonprofit, but in some sense, we were embedded within HHS.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We had different levels of data access and we used </span><strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9cm.htm" rel="">ICD-9 codes</a></strong><span>, which have since been revised to </span><strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10.htm#:~:text=The%20International%20Classification%20of%20Diseases,and%20presentation%20of%20mortality%20statistics." rel="">ICD-10</a></strong><span>, to paint an objective picture of how well, or in many cases, how poorly, these industry stakeholders were performing. Many people probably directionally knew that something was amiss in this system, but it was very opaque. Before having this data, it was hard to articulate what was going on to members of Congress, and you sometimes felt like you were Christopher Lloyd from </span><em>Back to the Future</em><span>, where you're just the forensic accountant or crazy person in the office.</span></p><p><strong>GS:</strong><span> We could access it as private citizens, but HHS employees really helped us understand why things were set up the way that they were, how things were coded, and which one of our ten ideas might actually be implementable. As Jennifer always says, government works by analogy. We had so many different ideas, and then civil servants would very soberly explain to us why nine of them were just completely unfeasible. When you're left with the one idea, that does not guarantee that it will happen. We then needed help understanding the ten different analogous projects that have happened in the last ten years to figure out how to implement ours.</span></p><p><span>So we used government data, and we validated it with some </span><strong><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28726327/" rel="">external data</a></strong><span> voluntarily shared from industry to verify that what we were doing was directionally correct with what was happening in industry.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> One of the things that really helped was the specificity. There had previously been </span><strong><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26813036/" rel="">federally funded research</a></strong><span> showing that in the United States as few as one in five organ donors were having their organs recovered. So four in five were not, right?&nbsp;</span></p><p>We knew that there was a gap between the huge support for organ donation and what was actually happening. What I’ve learned is that if there’s a big national problem, the government often does exactly the wrong thing. It punts, it does another big study, a consensus conference.&nbsp;</p><p><span>What you really need to understand is the data: what is happening in the state of Virginia, what's happening across Texas or California. There are 55 of these organ procurement organizations, and we found a </span><strong><a href="https://costlyeffects.organdonationreform.org/Summary/" rel="">470%</a></strong><span> variability in recovery between the top performers and the lowest performers. You need to ask, “What are the top performers doing that the bottom performers are not?” That really helps you get specific and follow the data to find problems you can solve.</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> So keep in mind, there's a huge generosity of spirit and national agreement about organ donation. Most people, myself included before I started this work, think of organ donation as, “Did you tick a box at the DMV when you got a driver's license?” And that really isn't the story of what happens.&nbsp;</span></p><p>In the United States, only 2-3% percent of deaths are organ donation-eligible. That includes car and motorcycle accidents, overdoses, strokes, and traumas: something that means a patient isn't going to make it, but up to eight of their organs might. When someone is dying in an organ donation-eligible way, that hospital calls the organ procurement organization they're assigned to. That OPO is supposed to turn up to every potential case in a timely and compassionate way and have one of two conversations with the family:&nbsp;</p><p>“Smith family, I'm so sorry for your loss. Jane was a registered organ donor. We'd like to proceed with her wishes.”&nbsp;</p><p>Or, “Smith family, I’m so sorry for your loss. Jane seemed like a wonderful person. Can we talk to you about organ donation?”&nbsp;</p><p>Keep in mind that 95% of Americans support organ donation. My older brother is a registered organ donor, and if, God forbid, something happened to him, and someone approached me at the hospital in a timely and compassionate way, I would consent to organ donation. If they do not approach me, then I cannot consent. If they do not show up at the hospital, even if he ticked the box at the DMV, those organs cannot be recovered.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Another problem is that when they do show up, OPOs are not required to have </span><strong><a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Diane%20Brockmeier%20Written%20Testimony-Senate%20Finance%20Committee.pdf" rel="">basic standards of clinical care</a></strong><span>. So another way in which organs are lost is </span><strong><a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/UNOS%20Hearing%20Confidential%20Memo%20(FOR%20RELEASE)%20on%20website.pdf" rel="">medical mistakes</a></strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Organs are literally lost and damaged in transit every single week. The OPTN contractor is </span><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxD0eYalmQI&amp;t=3934s" rel="">15 times</a></strong><span> more likely to </span><strong><a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/how-lifesaving-organs-for-transplant-go-missing-in-transit/" rel="">lose or damage an organ in transit</a></strong><span> than an airline is a suitcase. That should be shocking. Think about a donor family agreeing to organ donation on the worst day of their life, and what it means if their loved one's kidney gets left on the airport counter in Atlanta, or gets delayed and then thrown in the trash in another part of the country. And then, of course, what that means to one of the 100,000 Americans waiting to get that call for a lifesaving transplant.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>GS:</strong><span> I’ll also share a lesson on advocacy. There's a rare genetic condition in my family which causes heart failure. My dad and aunt had heart transplants, another aunt died waiting for her transplant. I spent a lot of time running around D.C., talking to people about the organ donation system, and had a lot of sympathetic meetings where people heard me out. I think I convinced them that I was right, and then they moved on to the next meeting and never thought about me again.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Then I realized that kidneys are not only just as important as hearts, but far more expensive to taxpayers. If you need a kidney, you are almost certainly waiting on dialysis, which is then paid for by Medicare. In 2019, </span><strong><a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/about-niddk/strategic-plans-reports/usrds/prior-data-reports/2019" rel="">treatment for kidney failure cost Medicare $36 billion</a></strong><span> — it might be higher now, and is certainly higher if you include Medicaid numbers and VA numbers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>One percent of the </span><strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/12/11/organ-donation-reform-could-save-thousands-lives-billions-taxes-column/4377383002/" rel="">entire federal budget</a></strong><span> goes to dialysis</span><strong>.</strong><span> So we started foregrounding kidneys in our advocacy, but reform to the kidney donation system, at least the deceased donation system, is a vehicle for the same reforms for all of the organ categories. After we started talking about the importance of helping people get kidney transplants, within a year or two, there was a presidential directive on reforming the organ donation system that rode on the </span><strong><a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-advancing-american-kidney-health/" rel="">Executive Order on Advancing American Kidney Health</a></strong><span>.</span></p><p>I was so blinded by telling my story that I didn't think for a while about what's actually going to resonate most with a person across the table from me. And in D.C., often that is not just who has the most sympathetic issue, but whose issue has a pay-for to it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> There are two areas of healthcare that are still under cost reimbursement, which means the taxpayer funds the vast majority of the system: critical access hospitals and organ procurement. As Greg alluded to, because of some amazing patient advocacy in the 1970s, kidneys have a unique classification and end-stage renal disease is the only major disease that qualifies you for Medicare regardless of age. In 1971, a patient was </span><strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234191/" rel="">dialyzed on the floor of Congress</a></strong><span>, and Congress decided they needed to help patients on dialysis and made an exception so that disease could be covered by Medicare.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So if we can get patients a kidney transplant, not only can they live a much better quality of life, which is what Greg and I care about, we can also save the taxpayer </span><strong><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35690519/" rel="">up to $1.5 million per patient</a></strong><span> in foregone dialysis. It's really rare in healthcare that patient and taxpayer interests are so closely aligned.</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> I think there were a few things. One is, you actually have two different types of contractors. The national contractor, OPTN, was supposed to be overseen by HRSA, which is one agency of HHS. The dozens of local OPOs are supposed to be overseen by </span><strong><a href="https://www.cms.gov/" rel="">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services</a></strong><span> (CMS). So you already had this division of oversight, and both agencies would say, “We have this government contractor — UNOS — that is supposed to be looking out over the whole system.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Here I'll quote </span><strong><a href="https://www.grassley.senate.gov/" rel="">Senator Chuck Grassley</a></strong><span>, who’s been investigating this since 2005. He said, “Asking one contractor to look out for dozens of others is like asking the fox to guard the chicken house.” It's fundamentally a failed model. It has left patients in a terrible and deadly position. The </span><em><strong><a href="https://thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/143-USDS-Report-Modernizing-OPTN-Jan-2021_Redacted70.pdf" rel="">Lives are at Stake</a></strong></em><span> report details a continuous erosion of leverage from the government through the contracting cycles.&nbsp;</span></p><p>For example, the report says that UNOS threatened to walk away and operate the U.S. transplant system outside the contract, which would be incredibly bad faith behavior. Government isn't a monolith, but I think some people in government perhaps thought they didn’t have alternatives. Keep in mind that OPOs are on four-year contracting cycles, and UNOS, the OPTN, has been on five-year contracting cycles. So all these contractors have had to do is withstand scrutiny during a contracting period, and then they're in for four or five more years.</p><p><span>A </span><em>Forbes</em><span> piece in 1999 </span><strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/1101/6411164a.html?sh=69eaaed7659f" rel="">called</a></strong><span> UNOS a “cartel”, and “the federal monopoly that's chilling the supply of transplantable organs and letting Americans who need them die needlessly.” </span><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Shalala" rel="">Donna Shalala</a></strong><span>, who was the Secretary of HHS under President Bill Clinton, called out </span><strong><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-105shrg51198/html/CHRG-105shrg51198.htm" rel="">UNOS misinformation</a></strong><span> in a Congressional hearing back in 1998 and called for competition in the field. The then-leader of HRSA </span><strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/1101/6411164a.html?sh=20cfd4b7659f" rel="">called</a></strong><span> for an end to the stranglehold of the UNOS monopoly, and yet 25 years later, UNOS is still the monopoly contractor in charge. I think people of goodwill tried to introduce reform, but UNOS still managed to keep the contract.</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> There have been some tremendous surgeons who have spoken up, and three have </span><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2748&amp;v=TnKo8Q-Hemk&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opodata.org%2F&amp;embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opodata.org&amp;source_ve_path=NzY3NTg&amp;feature=emb_yt_watermark" rel="">testified</a></strong><span> before three different congressional hearings in recent years, saying that too many of their patients are dying, and the system has to be fixed. There's also been investigative reporting about </span><strong><a href="https://about.bgov.com/news/biden-plan-to-fix-organ-transplant-network-promised-more-support/" rel="">UNOS threatening whistleblowers</a></strong><span>. I'm grateful for voices for reform and I just want to acknowledge that this is why the government has to act.</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> It did, but there were two problems. One, when it came to contracting, there was often a strict interpretation of that phrase in NOTA, which kept constraining competition.</span></p><p><span>I would also say that there are other oversight responsibilities that both HRSA and CMS should use and never have. The technology of UNOS is </span><strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/07/31/unos-transplants-kindeys-hearts-technology/" rel="">deeply failing and antiquated</a></strong><span> — for hours at a time, it will shut down and no organs across the country can be matched.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Organs are all on a clock, right? There's only so much cold ischemic time, or time outside the body, they can have. An astounding one out of every four kidneys that's recovered from a generous American organ donor is </span><strong><a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/media/p2oc3ada/data_report_kidney_full_20220624_1.pdf" rel="">thrown in the trash</a></strong><span>. The federal government has never held UNOS or any OPOs accountable for that.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Until recent data-driven regulation passed, CMS could not pull a contract from a failing OPO. They tried to decertify the Arkansas OPO in 1999, but </span><strong><a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/104/1084/2503890/" rel="">ultimately lost in court</a></strong><span> because the regulation was </span><strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/despite-low-performance-organ-collection-group-gets-new-federal-contract/2019/02/04/9b9ba2aa-2895-11e9-b2fc-721718903bfc_story.html" rel="">written so badly</a></strong><span>, yet CMS didn't update it for 21 years until 2020. That update, which passed under both </span><strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-finalizes-rule-that-could-make-thousands-more-organs-available-for-transplant/2020/11/21/912168d0-2b60-11eb-9b14-ad872157ebc9_story.html" rel="">President Trump</a></strong><span> and </span><strong><a href="https://www.pogo.org/investigations/americas-transformative-new-organ-donation-rule-goes-into-effect-over-objections-from-monopolistic-contractors" rel="">President Biden</a></strong><span>, was the first big win for patient advocates. OPOs will be held accountable for their performance this year. Between that and the Securing the U.S. OTPN Act that removed the restrictive phrase that propped up the national organ monopoly, we’re hoping that 2024 is a different year.</span></p><p><strong>GS:</strong><span> If you'll indulge me, I’ll add one other quick piece of context from 1999, not just as a history lesson, but because it is fiercely relevant now.</span></p><p><strong>GS:</strong><span> It’s one thing for HRSA to say that we need more competition back in 1999, but government contracting doesn’t let them just pick whoever they want and bet on them. HRSA can only respond to credible bids that meet contracting requirements. The </span><em>Forbes</em><span> report mentioned that UNOS was interfering with other competitors’ bids, but even if everyone knew that, HRSA’s hands would still have been tied.</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> I mentioned how Greg brought this issue to the White House when I was in the Obama administration. After the transition in January 2017, we brought it to Alex Azar, who was the Secretary of HHS. [Statecraft </span><em>interviewed Secretary Azar on “How to Replicate Operation Warp Speed.”</em><span>] Greg, Secretary Azar, and I all lost relatives to organ failure, so we were all connected in this rather unfortunate way. We said, “We want to show you everything we started, every place that we failed and where there's still work to do. This is not a political issue.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This is a rare bipartisan issue that's crossed multiple administrations. We had similar conversations with Congress members and their staffs, and as I said, Senator Chuck Grassley has done hero’s work highlighting problems at OPOs over the years. We also worked with then-ranking member </span><strong><a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/" rel="">Ron Wyden</a></strong><span>, who is now chair of the Senate Finance Committee, </span><strong><a href="https://www.cardin.senate.gov/" rel="">Senator</a></strong><a href="https://www.cardin.senate.gov/" rel=""> </a><strong><a href="https://www.cardin.senate.gov/" rel="">Ben Cardin</a></strong><span>, and </span><strong><a href="https://www.young.senate.gov/" rel="">Senator Todd Young</a></strong><span>, who actually reached out to Greg over a cold email when Young was still a member of the House. The four of them have really been tremendous leaders in this work.</span></p><p><span>So we went to see members of the Senate Finance Committee and also talked to members of the </span><strong><a href="https://oversight.house.gov/" rel="">House Oversight Committee</a></strong><span>, which had a bipartisan hearing back in 2021. We tried to bring the data and the experts to show them what was going on. The Senate Finance investigation is now four years old, literally longer than Watergate, and has driven many reforms. And I think it's important to realize that Congress can still work. I really want to give credit to not only those four senators, but also </span><strong><a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/" rel="">Senators Elizabeth Warren</a></strong><span>, </span><strong><a href="https://www.booker.senate.gov/" rel="">Cory Booker</a></strong><span>, </span><strong><a href="https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/" rel="">Jerry Moran</a></strong><span>, </span><strong><a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/" rel="">Bill Cassidy</a></strong><span>, and on the House side, </span><strong><a href="https://porter.house.gov/" rel="">Congresswoman Katie Porter</a></strong><span>, and the current leader of the House Oversight Committee, </span><strong><a href="https://comer.house.gov/" rel="">James Comer</a></strong><span>. There are a lot of unlikely bedfellows here.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>GS:</strong><span> The Senate Finance Committee investigation launched publicly in February 2020, but Senator Todd Young first contacted me in 2014, when he was still a congressman. He was elected to the Senate in 2016, and eventually in 2018, he moved over to the Senate Finance Committee, where Chuck Grassley was Chair at the time and had been investigating UNOS on and off since 2005.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> I think out of the gate, it helps to have bipartisanship and finding points of commonality. You need to be able to convince the two political parties that this makes sense to move on and ground things in data.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I just want to give a tremendous amount of credit to members and their staff, who really stayed focused on patients at every turn. They </span><strong><a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/grassley-wyden-subpoena-the-united-network-for-organ-sharing-as-part-of-continued-investigation-into-us-organ-transplant-system" rel="">subpoenaed UNOS</a></strong><span> when it was stonewalling the investigation, and staffers pored over patient safety documents to highlight exactly what happened and who to hold accountable. It was painstaking work.&nbsp;</span></p><p>There’s been a ton of resistance from some of the contractors themselves, but I also want to call out the good actors. There have been OPO leaders who have called for reform, who said that their jobs matter and that they and their colleagues should be held to a high standard. Some of them have testified before both the House and the Senate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GS:</strong><span> There have now been two Senate Finance Committee hearings. The hearings are vehicles to achieve a goal, and the Senate Finance Committee was so strategic and thoughtful about the fact that there were a hundred problems with the system. We fixed a few, but there are still ninety-something left.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The first hearing was in August of 2022, and a potential contracting cycle for OTPN was coming up. That hearing successfully showed that the status quo is unsafe and untenable, and by March of 2023, HRSA announced the intent to break up the OPTN monopoly in the </span><strong><a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/optn-modernization" rel="">OPTN Modernization Initiative</a></strong><span>. Then in the July 2023 Senate Finance Committee hearing, Senators advocated for the passage of legislation to amend NOTA to support the breakup of the monopoly contract. Seven days later, the legislation passed. So to your point about scoring points on a TikTok executive, if there isn't a clear policy goal, what's going to fill that vacuum is a partisan goal or someone's need to go viral for reelection.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> Yeah. The Senate Finance investigation is ongoing, but it launched in </span><strong><a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/finance-committee-members-probe-us-organ-transplant-system" rel="">February 2020</a></strong><span>. They issued a damning report of system failures that called for the breakup of the monopoly in August of 2022. The modernization initiative then followed about nine months later, saying that they needed help from Congress to amend the National Organ Transplant Act. That bill actually originally came out of the </span><strong><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4343/text?s=1&amp;r=63" rel="">Energy and Commerce Committee</a></strong><span> in the House, which is the Committee of Jurisdiction. Both the House and Senate passed the bill unanimously last July.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> And this was not only Senate Finance, but also, huge credit to Senator Cory Booker and then-Congressman Mondaire Jones, who led a </span><strong><a href="https://www.booker.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_the_biden_admin_on_organ_donations.pdf" rel="">bicameral letter in November of 2022</a></strong><span> that underscored the importance of the committee recommendations and called to break up the national monopoly and that CMS enforce the OPO rule as an urgent health equity issue.</span></p><p><span>We're now four years on from the investigation and just last week HRSA </span><strong><a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/optn-modernization" rel="">issued the first draft competitive Requests for Proposal (RFPs)</a></strong><span> for pieces of the OPTN contract. In our minds, nothing is actually going to be done until the monopoly is broken up, and there are new, competent contractors working in transparent contracting cycles that the government is holding accountable.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The rule that lets CMS hold OPOs accountable based on objective data </span><strong><a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/organ-procurement-organization-opo-conditions-coverage-final-rule-revisions-outcome-measures-opos" rel="">passed in 2020</a></strong><span>, but none of them have lost a contractor contract yet because of the sheer amount of time it takes to put those rules through and get through contracting cycles. The OPO rule went through a midnight regulatory review process in 2021, was passed again by the Biden administration, and then we had to wait for the next contracting cycle.</span></p><p><span>This year the federal government will collect data, but that data won’t be available until 2026, when failing OPOs will be replaced by higher performers. That regulation alone is projected to save </span><strong><a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/new-organ-donation-rule-win-black-patients-and-health-equity" rel="">7,000 lives a year</a></strong><span> and </span><strong><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-24/biden-should-implement-trump-s-organ-donation-policy-fix" rel="">one billion dollars annually</a></strong><span> to Medicare. So when will we think that the system is working for patients? When every part of the country is served by a high-performing OPO. That's not an abstract vision, you can look at performance metrics from the government.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> I would go back to what Senator Chuck Grassley talked about, the fox guarding the chicken house. In the fight for the OPO rule, we saw that UNOS leaders were surrogates for the status quo on unenforceable OPO metrics and tried to block accountability. In similar fashion, the Association of OPOs lobbied against different provisions in the bill, trying to restrict competition.</span></p><p><strong>GS:</strong><span> I think that there was a lot of laundering of that opposition through other groups, whether through an astroturf lobbying group or misinforming well-meaning patients who thought they were advocating for themselves but were doing it based on completely uninformed, misleading, or objectively incorrect inputs. In the last few years, lobbyists have said “We support the goals of increasing transplant, but we have edits,” but then their edits just oppose everything.</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> There can be valid reasons to discard organs, but the United States is the only country that is throwing away one out of every four kidneys. I don't think anyone would be impressed by the “Look how many kidneys we didn't lose” argument much as they wouldn't want to hear a pilot say, “Look how many flights I didn't crash.” This is a system that has to operate at a high level every day, and we know how to do these logistics. Yet in 2024, we have a system where the technology goes down for hours at a time. The wifi at my house doesn't go down for hours at a time. And if it did, it would have no real consequence. That we have life and death systems that have such abject failures should be alarming.</span></p><p>In some instances, the system does work. Greg's dad got a heart transplant, but I do not think that it should have been a five year wait. We put patients and their families through way too much unnecessary pain, and the organ waiting list is an awful place to be. There are OPOs that do their job at a really high level, and I want every family and patient to receive that service.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GS:</strong><span> To respond to that Kevin O'Connor quote, he is right that there are many reasons that organs are discarded. Jennifer is also right that the U.S. is an outlier. It isn’t necessarily true that one thing went wrong 100 times. It could be true that 20 things went wrong and they each went wrong five times, but the U.S. is the only country in which that happens. That still means that UNOS is failing to identify and remediate problems in the system.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Yes, to Kevin’s point, transportation is a problem, but there are also ten other problems. I think that should only increase the urgency. Perversely, sometimes it just increases the feelings of fatalism in government.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GS:</strong><span> That is also a contributing problem, but let me give some context on how having an antiquated technology system exacerbates the problem. Remember, every organ is on a clock, and only good for so long. If I’m a surgeon, my patient is first on the list, and I'm offered the organ but for regulatory or perverse incentive, I don't want to take it for my patient, it goes to the next patient on the list. This becomes problematic because the technology is decades old. Seventeen percent of kidneys are </span><strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6724162/" rel="">offered to at least one deceased person</a></strong><span> before they are transplanted, because the system doesn’t do appropriate data hygiene to pull deceased patients off of the list.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Are there also things that can be addressed for transplant centers? Absolutely. UNOS could make their technology nimble so that it's easy to go down the list, whether the surgeons are passing the kidney for a good or bad reason. They could identify policy problems, OPO behavior, or surgeon behavior, and go to regulatory bodies like CMS to demand they fix it. UNOS hasn’t done that. If you really press them into a corner, they’ll sometimes explain that there are lots of problems, but they have no track record of looking for solutions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> What I hope comes across is that this has been an effort across multiple administrations, with both political parties and two branches of government working to fix the system. It’s still not done, so we have to keep going. To win a policy fight, you have to win the same argument multiple times, and it’s important to stay vigilant beyond the regulation or law or front page story, until implementation actually affects people's lives.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

      <p>Firefox View now displays pinned tabs in the Open tabs section.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote>“The ability to do authorization queries over data in our existing database reduces architectural complexity and is a big technical win for us. We’re super excited to take advantage of it.” – Anthony Cristiano, Staff Software Engineer, Headway</blockquote><p>Authorization as a Service. The reality falls short of the promise. That’s because to use an authorization service, you have to send it a lot of application data. Any solution that signs you up for a data synchronization process isn’t providing a service. It’s creating a burden.</p><p>When we started work on Oso, we knew this. It’s one of the key problems we set out to solve. Today we’re taking a major step towards realizing that vision with the release of <strong><em>Distributed Authorization</em></strong>.</p><p>Distributed Authorization lets you apply your application data to authorization decisions without synchronizing it to Oso Cloud. Instead, you distribute authorization decisions between the Oso Cloud service and the Oso Cloud client in your application.</p><p>This may sound counterintuitive – shouldn’t an authorization service answer authorization questions on its own? Surprisingly, no.</p><p>In this post, we’ll show you how we reached that conclusion and why we’re so excited about Distributed Authorization.</p><h2>DIY Authorization: Good until it Isn’t</h2><p>Authorization starts with a question. Consider <a href="https://github.com/osohq/gitcloud">gitcloud</a>, our sample version control app. You may be asked this question: May <code>alice</code> <code>read</code> the <code>amazing-app</code> repository? In order to answer this question you need two things: logic and data. The logic might be:</p><p>A <code>user</code> may <code>read</code> a <code>repository</code> in their <code>organization</code> if they have the <code>maintainer</code> or <code>admin</code> role on that <code>repository</code> </p><p>The data might be:</p><ul role="list"><li><code>alice</code> is a member of the <code>acme</code> organization.</li><li>the <code>acme</code> organization contains the <code>amazing-app</code> repository</li><li><code>alice</code> has the <code>maintainer</code> role on the <code>amazing-app</code> repository</li></ul><p>By combining the logic and the data, we get our answer: <code>alice</code> can <code>read</code> the <code>amazing-app</code> repository.</p><p>In the early stages of an application, this logic usually lives in the application code, and the data in the application database. For the case of our simple question above, that might look like this:</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>// Get this user's roles on the repo</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> userRoles = db.getUserRoles({ </span><span>userId</span><span>: user.id, </span><span>repoId</span><span>: issue.repoId});
</span>
<span></span><span>// Check whether the user has a role that confers read access</span><span>

When you mix application logic and authorization logic in your application code, you make that policy implicit. The problem with things that are implicit is that they’re easy to misunderstand, or to miss entirely. Suppose you decide to add teams to gitcloud, so different teams in an organization can have different permissions. Will you be able to find all the functions and queries you need to modify in order to make teams work properly? Do you want to have to do that?</p><p>This is why we introduced <a href="https://www.osohq.com/docs/reference/polar/foundations">Polar</a>, our declarative DSL for authorization. Polar allows you to separate your authorization logic from your application logic and express it in a language that is purpose built for authorization. A simple Polar policy looks something like this:</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>allow(user: User, </span><span>"read"</span><span>, </span><span>org</span><span>: Organization) </span><span>if</span><span>
</span><span>	has_role(user, </span><span>"member"</span><span>, org);
</span>	
<span>has_role(User{</span><span>"alice"</span><span>}, </span><span>"member"</span><span>, Organization{</span><span>"acme"</span><span>});</span></code></pre><p>We’ve specified the entities we’re interested in: <code>User</code> and <code>Organization</code>. We’ve defined the conditions that allow a given <code>User</code> to <code>read</code> an <code>Organization</code>, in terms of the <code>member</code> role. Finally, we’ve asserted that <code>alice</code> has the <code>member</code> role on the <code>acme</code> organization.</p><p>Like any new language, it takes a little getting used to if you haven’t worked with Polar before, but we can see from this example that it’s both concise and expressive. These are important characteristics if our aim is to make your authorization logic explicit. If you had to wade through a bunch of confusing syntax to divine that logic, we would have done a lot of work for nothing.</p><p>Explicit policy is a big improvement for complex authorization logic. Now we needed to let you take advantage of that policy in your code. This is why we built the Oso library.</p><h2>Oso Library: Authorization for Monoliths</h2><p>The Oso library represented our initial implementation of a client to Polar. There was a lot to like about it. It was open source. It operated directly over your data. It integrated tightly with your application. With your policy defined in Polar and the open source library embedded in your application, you could find out whether <code>alice</code> can <code>read</code> a <code>repository</code> like this:</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>@app.route(</span><span>"/repo/&lt;name&gt;"</span><span>)
</span>def repo_show(name):
    repo = Repository.get_by_name(name)

<span>    </span><span>try</span><span>:
</span><span>        oso.authorize(User.get_current_user(), </span><span>"read"</span><span>, repo)
</span>        
<span>        </span><span>return</span><span> f</span><span>"&lt;h1&gt;A Repo&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to repo {repo.name}&lt;/p&gt;"</span><span>, </span><span>200</span><span>
</span>    except NotFoundError:
<span>        </span><span>return</span><span> f</span><span>"&lt;h1&gt;Whoops!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repo named {name} was not found&lt;/p&gt;"</span><span>, </span><span>404</span></code></pre><p>The beauty of this was that as your authorization logic gets more complicated, the application code stayed just this simple. You expressed the authorization logic in a .polar file, where you could version and inspect it alongside your application code. When you needed to ask if a given user was authorized to perform a given action, you always asked the same question, in exactly those terms:</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>oso.authorize(&lt;User&gt;, &lt;action&gt;, &lt;resource&gt;)</span></code></pre><p>As powerful as this was, over time we learned that the library approach has some significant downsides.</p><p>The library got access to application data via a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ffi.html">foreign function interface</a> (FFI). This was clever (and fun) engineering, but the mental model tripped up a lot of developers, and made things hard to debug.</p><p>There was no standard data model. This was part of the point – we built the library to operate over your data. As convenient as it was to have direct access to that data, in practice we observed performance issues and inconsistent behavior caused by details of the underlying data model that we could neither see nor change ourselves. This lack of standardization also made it hard for us to build new capabilities on top of the library.</p><p>But the main problem was this: the library was a great solution if you have a single service. A lot of people, however, have more than one service! For these people, the library approach only solved a piece of the puzzle.</p><h2>Oso Cloud: Authorization for Microservices</h2><p>When your application is a monolith, it’s straightforward to implement your authorization logic with something like the Oso library. You write your logic in a <code>.polar</code> file that lives in the same repository as all the rest of your code. Then you load it when you initialize the client. Finally, you issue authorization requests against the loaded policy. You don’t have to worry about data, because it’s all in a single database that all your code can access.</p><p>But when you break your application up into multiple services, you introduce new questions. Which service should own the authorization model? There’s no good answer, because the model needs data to be effective, and that data is now split across services. Can each service have its own model? No, because authorization questions often span services. Let’s go back to deciding whether <code>alice</code> can triage an <code>Issue</code>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/661e79566ab74177a2807255_Multi-Service-Auth.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The Issue service knows whether <code>alice</code> created the issue. The Repository service knows whether <code>alice</code> has the <code>triage</code> role on the repository, and the User service knows whether <code>alice</code> has the <code>triage</code> role on the organization. So now you’re making multiple API calls to figure out whether <code>alice</code> can <code>triage</code> the issue.</p><p>The design that ends up making the most sense is to have a dedicated service for authorization, but now you have to build your own APIs, create your own data model, figure out how to design change control. It’s a lot of work.</p><p>So our next step was to take that work on. We designed Oso Cloud to solve authorization in multi-service environments. This let us address two persistent issues in the library model:</p><ul role="list"><li>We built a hosted solution that could be shared by all services in an application.</li><li>We defined a consistent data model for authorization data.</li></ul><p>The Oso Cloud data model is called <a href="https://www.osohq.com/docs/concepts/oso-cloud-data-model">facts</a>. Facts are a lightweight, flexible format that can represent any authorization data in your application.</p><p>Oso Cloud brings the benefits of policy as code to multi-service applications. You can make your authorization logic explicit, share it amongst all of your services, and represent your authorization data in a standard format that’s optimized for authorization operations. But now we’ve recreated exactly the problem we set out to solve: you have to sync your application data to our service.</p><h2>Authorization as a Service: Excessive Centralization</h2><p>Let’s take a look back at why we started down this road. Our application got brittle because the application logic and the authorization logic were intertwined. We wanted to make authorization logic explicit, and in order to do that in a way that worked for microservices, we created a hosted service that provides the benefits of Polar behind an API.</p><p>To answer authorization questions, we need more than logic. We also need data. And in that respect, Oso Cloud suffers from the same limitation that all centralized authorization services do. It needs that data to exist <em>in the service</em>.</p><p>But that’s our problem, not yours. You already have that data where you need it: in your application. By requiring you to convert it to facts and synchronize it to Oso Cloud, we’re making our lives easier at the cost of making yours harder. Now you have to deal with potentially massive initial data loads, distributed transactions, sync and replication processes, detecting drift. None of this is easy.</p><p>We know it’s not easy, because you’ve told us it isn’t. The good news is that this was never the end state for us.</p><h2>Distributed Authorization: Microservices done right</h2><p>What we really want to do is let you centralize your authorization logic without centralizing all of your authorization data. To do this, we have to let go of a fundamental assumption of Authorization as a Service: that the service has to answer the question independently. It’s this requirement that makes it necessary for the authorization service to have <em>all of your application data</em>.</p><p>What if, instead, you could centralize your logic and your common authorization data (things like roles) in the authorization service, and then distribute the evaluation of authorization questions between the server and the client? That’s Distributed Authorization. Instead of only answering <code>yes</code> or <code>no</code>, Oso Cloud can now respond to an authorization question with <code>yes, if</code>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/661e7985c375a2d9548dd6df_LF-AaaS-Distributed.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>That <code>yes, if</code> is followed by a list of conditions that are evaluated at the client using your local data. You give the Oso Cloud client a configuration file that tells it how to test those conditions by converting your application data to facts. At authorization time, the Oso Cloud service evaluates as much of the request as it knows, and then hands off the remainder to the Oso Cloud client in your application.</p><h2>A Practical Application: Filtering Lists</h2><p>One area where this shines is filtering lists of authorized data. We’ve already talked about how painful it can be to get your application data into a centralized authorization service. It can also be painful to get it back out. If you want to generate a list of Issues that <code>alice</code> can <code>triage</code> and all of your data is centralized in your authorization service, then the operation looks like this:</p><ul role="list"><li>Ask the service for a list of Issue IDs that <code>alice</code> can <code>triage</code></li><li>Get the full list of IDs back from the service</li><li>Use the list of IDs to query your local database for Issue data</li></ul><p>This is how the <code>oso.list</code> command works, and it works great in a lot of cases.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/661e79a2d8205c333e9fce74_List-Filtering-Centralized.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>For users who belong to multiple organizations, or who belong to organizations with very active repositories, that list of Issues can get very long! It's not hard to envision situations where a user has access to hundreds or thousands of issues. That’s a lot of data going across the internet before you’re able to use it in your application.</p><p>Oso Cloud now supports <a href="https://www.osohq.com/docs/guides/integrate/filter-lists">List Filtering using Distributed Data</a>. When you use local data to generate lists of authorized resources, rather than returning the full list of resources, Oso Cloud instead returns a (much shorter) query filter to the client. The client then uses this filter to construct the full list from your locally stored data. You get your response back from Oso faster, and because you generate the list in your local database, you can sort and paginate the results using the tools you're already using to handle large sets of application data.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/661e79bea17ed6490e2c61a9_List-Filtering-Distributed.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Bringing our Vision into Focus</h2><blockquote>“Our team was looking for a new authorization system. We assessed a number of technologies (plus building our own) and Oso's distributed architecture, in-depth auth knowledge, and 99.99% uptime were key reasons why we chose Oso.” – Guhan Venguswamy, Head of Platform Engineering, Jasper.ai</blockquote><p>With Distributed Authorization, you get the the benefits of explicit authorization logic without the penalty of centralizing all your authorization data. It’s Authorization as a Service that works with your application, rather than forcing you to rework your application to work with it.</p><p>This is a major milestone for us, but we know the job’s not done. We’re continuing to make it easier for you to centralize the data that you do want to keep in Oso Cloud. We’re enhancing Polar to make it even more flexible and robust. And we haven’t forgotten about monoliths – although the Oso library is now deprecated, we’re working on bringing these capabilities to you too!</p><p>In the coming weeks, we’ll be sharing more on how Distributed Authorization works under the hood, and the different ways customers like Headway and Jasper.ai are already using it. </p><p>If you’d like to learn more about how to use it in your app, <a href="https://www.osohq.com/docs/guides/integrate/filter-lists?utm_content=distributedauthz_launchpost#list-filtering-with-decentralized-data">check our our docs for Distributed Authorization and List Filtering</a>. </p><p>Do you have questions or want to share your thoughts? <a href="https://join-slack.osohq.com/">Reach out to us on Slack</a> or <a href="https://calendly.com/osohq/oso-cloud-1-on-1?utm_content=distributed_authz_launchpost">Schedule a 1x1 with an Engineer</a>!

In the end this results in multiple Aggregated contextual information vectors.</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">10.7)Transformer: Last Attention Layer Step</h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">These heads are stacked together and are mapped to vectors of size <strong data-v-444dbe18="">d</strong> which was the same size as our patch embeddings had.</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">10.8)Transformer: Attention Layer Result</h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">The previous step concluded the attention layer and we are left with the same amount of embeddings of <strong data-v-444dbe18="">exactly the same size</strong> as we used as input.</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">10.9)Transformer: Residual connections</h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">Transformers make heavy use of <strong data-v-444dbe18="">residual connections</strong> which simply means adding the input of the previous layer to the output the current layer.

The model is trained using backpropagation and gradient descent, updating the model parameters to minimize the loss function.</p><p data-v-444dbe18="">In this visual guide, we have walked through the key components of Vision Transformers, from the data preparation to the training of the model.
