<h2 id="what-is-scale">What is SCALE?<a href="#what-is-scale" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>SCALE is a GPGPU programming toolkit that allows CUDA applications to be
natively compiled for AMD GPUs.</p>
<p>SCALE does not require the CUDA program or its build system to be modified.</p>
<p>Support for more GPU vendors and CUDA APIs is in development.</p>
<p>To get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>See the <a href="https://docs.scale-lang.com/manual/how-to-use/">tutorial</a>.</li>
<li>Review the <a href="https://docs.scale-lang.com/examples/">examples</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#contact-us">Contact us</a> for help.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?<a href="#how-does-it-work" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>SCALE has several key innovations compared to other cross-platform GPGPU
solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCALE accepts CUDA programs as-is. No need to port them to another 
  language. This is true even if your program uses inline PTX <code>asm</code>.</li>
<li>The SCALE compiler accepts the same command-line options and CUDA dialect
  as <code>nvcc</code>, serving as a drop-in replacement.</li>
<li>"Impersonates" an installation of the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit, so existing 
  build tools and scripts like <code>cmake</code> <em>just work</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-projects-have-been-tested">What projects have been tested?<a href="#what-projects-have-been-tested" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>We validate SCALE by compiling open-source CUDA projects and running their
tests.
The following open-source projects are currently part of our nightly automated 
tests and pass fully:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/thrust">NVIDIA Thrust</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/blender/cycles">Blender Cycles</a></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="which-gpus-are-supported">Which GPUs are supported?<a href="#which-gpus-are-supported" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>The following GPU targets are supported, and are covered by our nightly tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD <code>gfx1030</code> (Navi 21, RDNA 2.0)</li>
<li>AMD <code>gfx1100</code> (Navi 31, RDNA 3.0)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following GPU targets have undergone ad-hoc manual testing and "seem to
work":</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD <code>gfx1010</code></li>
<li>AMD <code>gfx1101</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We are working on supporting the following GPUs:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD <code>gfx900</code> (Vega 10, GCN 5.0)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#contact-us">Contact us</a> if you want us to expedite support for a particular AMD GPU
architecture.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-components-of-scale">What are the components of SCALE?<a href="#what-are-the-components-of-scale" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>SCALE consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <code>nvcc</code>-compatible compiler capable of compiling nvcc-dialect CUDA for AMD
  GPUs, including PTX asm.</li>
<li>Implementations of the CUDA runtime and driver APIs for AMD GPUs.</li>
<li>Open-source wrapper libraries providing the "CUDA-X" APIs by delegating to the
  corresponding ROCm libraries.
  This is how libraries such as <code>cuBLAS</code> and <code>cuSOLVER</code> are handled.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-the-differences-between-scale-and-other-solutions">What are the differences between SCALE and other solutions?<a href="#what-are-the-differences-between-scale-and-other-solutions" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Instead of providing a <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">new way</a> to write GPGPU 
software, SCALE allows programs written using the widely-popular CUDA
language to be directly compiled for AMD GPUs.</p>
<p>SCALE aims to be fully compatible with NVIDIA CUDA. We believe that users 
should not have to maintain multiple codebases or compromise on performance
to support multiple GPU vendors.</p>
<p>SCALE's language is a <em>superset</em> of NVIDIA CUDA, offering some opt-in
<a href="https://docs.scale-lang.com/manual/language-extensions/">language extensions</a>
that can make writing GPU code easier and more efficient for users who wish
to move away from <code>nvcc</code>.</p>
<p>SCALE is a work in progress. If there is a missing API that is blocking your
attempt to use SCALE, please contact us so we can prioritise its development.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyj4emsl000q3b834ntpxpn2@published" data-word-count="76">One morning at the end of April 2023, Marcela Maus, a cancer researcher at Mass General in Boston, got a call from her colleague Bryan Choi. “He called me, and he’s like, ‘Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!’ And I’m like, ‘What is going on?’” Maus said. Choi, a neurosurgeon with the languid demeanor of a surfer, was not given to outbursts. Maus hung up the phone and hurried over to his office.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjoblv2000q3b83hsylc7ab@published" data-word-count="77">The day before, Choi and Maus had treated their first patient in a clinical trial for an aggressive brain cancer called glioblastoma, infusing genetically modified white blood cells directly into the fluid surrounding the brain. They had been up all night worrying, especially after the patient, a 74-year-old man, developed a fever. Choi had ordered an MRI. “We were not looking for the results,” he said. “We were trying to make sure that our patient was okay.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjoblwl000r3b83mml2cp5f@published" data-word-count="83">When Maus got to Choi’s office, images from the MRI were loading on his screen. They stared in wonder: The patient’s tumor, which a few days before had shown up on the scan as a bright blob the size of a strawberry, had almost entirely disappeared. No one had heard of that kind of regression in glioblastoma, especially not overnight. “My first instinct was that there was something wrong with the MRI scanner,” Choi said. But then the follow-up scans looked even better.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobly3000s3b83j2fzsj6o@published" data-word-count="63">Several weeks later, they treated a second patient, a civil engineer from upstate New York named Tom Fraser, and the process repeated itself: the infusion, the fever, and the rapid regression of the tumor. “It was almost like clockwork,” Maus said, still sounding astonished months later. After a third patient had a similar response, she paused the trial and wrote up her results.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobm0q000t3b83rl3h29nm@published" data-word-count="67">Glioblastoma is the most common type of malignant brain cancer. It can strike at any age, and it’s uniformly fatal. Patients are often diagnosed in the emergency room after the tumor causes some somatic catastrophe, such as seizure, sudden loss of speech, or an inability to control the limbs on one side of the body. The median time from diagnosis to death is just over a year.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobm2z000u3b83cmlz7byg@published" data-word-count="107">The first step in treating the disease hasn’t changed in decades: “maximal safe resection,” a surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible while preserving neurological function. Because glioblastoma is so adept at infiltrating the brain, the surgeon almost always leaves cancer behind, which quickly starts growing again. Some patients respond to radiation or the chemotherapy drug temozolomide, but even that adds months rather than years to the average survival time. Roger Stupp, an expert in glioblastoma (he wrote the paper that made temozolomide “standard of care”), told me the disease had proved to be “a graveyard of ideas.” Decades of research have gone nowhere.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobm4n000v3b83cycggo54@published" data-word-count="64">Within the past 20 years, however, a once unfashionable field called immunotherapy has upended all expectations in oncology. It proceeds from a simple premise: The human immune system is very good at attacking anything it registers as disease. If it could be turned against cancer, it could eliminate a tumor more thoroughly than a surgeon’s knife and more durably than the poison of chemotherapy.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobm6k000w3b838t8ihiu3@published" data-word-count="100">Maus and Choi thought they’d found a way to do just that using the immune system’s all-purpose killer: the T cell, which the body sends to neutralize pathogens of all sorts, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites, but not (usually) cancer. By extracting T cells from a patient’s blood, editing the cells’ DNA in a lab, and reintroducing them at the site of the tumor, they had gotten the body to react to cancer as it would to a virus and destroy it. It was the culmination of years of research in immunotherapy labs like the one Maus runs at Mass General.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobm82000x3b83hqlqkxqx@published" data-word-count="71">Fraser remembers that on the day of his infusion, the room was crowded with doctors, nurses, and scientists. There was a sense, he said, that history was being made. “I felt a little poke when the needle was inserted,” he wrote me in an email, “but it was a very quick process.” Twenty-four days later, he walked out of the hospital, weak and exhausted but with his tumor in near-total remission.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobm9p000y3b83cee4xq8e@published" data-word-count="70">“There’s been a revolution in understanding cancer and the tools to tackle it,” Daniel Haber, the director of the Mass General Cancer Center, told me. Immunotherapy, paired with our greater understanding of the genetics of cancer cells, has produced breakthroughs for previously untreatable forms of the disease, especially in liquid tumors like leukemia and lymphoma and skin cancers like melanoma. Death sentences have been commuted; hopeless cases have been cured.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobmbk000z3b8313t6r5d6@published" data-word-count="77">Until recently, the biggest exception to this parade of good news has been in solid tumors like pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma, which have resisted almost all efforts to check them. So Fraser had it right. If these early results from Boston held, it would make history. If we can treat glioblastoma — perhaps the hardest case in a field made up of hard cases — there’s not a cancer that would seem to be out of reach.</p>

  

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobmhz00113b83efyfpqwx@published" data-word-count="54">After Choi and Maus published their results in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> in March, they heard from oncologists all over the world. “They’re desperate, and they say, ‘We want to offer something because there’s just nothing out there,’” Choi told me. The status quo, Choi knew from his own patients, was miserable.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobmjx00123b83g71y2gl7@published" data-word-count="94">This spring, I got to witness the kind of brain surgery that’s standard of care for glioblastoma but may one day become obsolete. It was both simple and high-tech. Five figures in blue scrubs stood around the patient, and there were screens on every wall stacked like amps at a death-metal show. I was led around the operating table, ducking between machines until I arrived at the patient’s head, where the surgeon showed me how he could insert a stereotactic probe and see on the monitor exactly where in the brain he was working.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobml900133b83r0qn8t3y@published" data-word-count="93">A square of scalp on the patient’s head was peeled back to reveal the skull underneath. A smaller area of skull, about the size of an eye patch, had been removed, and the brain itself sat exposed, pulsing with each heartbeat, as if it were breathing. And it was: The engine of cognition, the seat of human consciousness, the anthropocentric core of the universe lay before us, and it was alive, fragile and yet somehow bursting with vitality, like it wanted nothing more than to leap free of the vessel that contained it.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobmmt00143b830e7wgy6a@published" data-word-count="57">On a screen on the far wall, I could see a hole where the tumor had been, an almost perfectly round miniature planet. I switched my gaze to look at the brain directly. The hole was darker than I would have imagined. I tried to stare all the way into its bottom but could see only black.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobmp700153b835jcwa7vr@published" data-word-count="81">Patients with glioblastoma are often sent to surgery within days of their diagnosis. The urgency comes both from the aggressiveness of the disease and the unique nature of the brain itself. Trapped inside the skull, there’s nowhere for it to go when a tumor begins growing. As normal tissue is pushed aside, the neurological effects can multiply quickly. Cancer elsewhere in the body can be debilitating, but it’s unlikely to suddenly take away your ability to speak, to move, to think.</p>

Hundreds of people with glioblastoma have written to or called Mass General about the study, but Maus had room for only 18 more. I asked her whether they had already filled the remaining spots. She said they couldn’t: Until recently, her team could treat only one patient at a time, and the disease progresses too quickly to look more than a few months into the future. “It’s heartbreaking,” Maus said about having to turn people away. “You get a lot of stories.”</p>

That summer, Katie and Kevin were driving down for a vacation in Myrtle Beach with their two children, ages 3 and 5. They had made good time from their home in Annapolis, so Kevin phoned the hotel and asked if they could check in early. Shortly after he hung up, he began convulsing and moaning. The kids were watching cartoons in the back seat, “and they thought he was playing a joke on them, like being like a monster, and I thought so too,” Katie said. “I grabbed his arm, and I realized his eyes were in the back of his head.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobn0l00183b83hmvgnill@published" data-word-count="62">Katie pulled to the side of the road and Kevin’s head fell in her lap. He was out for several minutes, during which he soiled himself. When he woke up, Katie was standing outside the passenger side of the car checking his pulse. “He’s like, ‘Katie, what are you doing?’ And I said, ‘Nothing, everything’s fine. Something seems a little off with you.’”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobna200193b832zrc4i3g@published" data-word-count="102">At the hospital in Myrtle Beach, doctors saw two lesions on his brain. Kevin had his first surgery on August 2, at Johns Hopkins, and began radiation and chemotherapy. When Katie recounts the months that followed, her voice falters as she remembers how difficult their lives became. She kept spreadsheets of appointments and medications and leads to follow for novel treatments. “I started researching because I remember in the beginning going to a lot of the appointments and not knowing the lingo,” she said. “And I didn’t want to waste any more time asking somebody, ‘Can you tell me what they were talking about?’”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobnbr001a3b83x7f1dizi@published" data-word-count="57">Katie and Kevin were college sweethearts. They met at the University of Maryland and married in 2010. He was so lovable, Katie said. He liked to play little pranks on the family: dropping habanero in Katie’s drink when she wasn’t watching or waking his mother-in-law up with a leaf blower. He was 32 when he was diagnosed.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobndf001b3b83qof7zqbd@published" data-word-count="114">Kevin remained optimistic even as the disease progressed, while Katie remained, in her words, the worrywart. “In the beginning,” she said, “I would cry and be so sad and have so much anxiety about it, worrying about his fate, and he would be like, ‘Hey, Katie, if not us, it would be somebody else.’” Eventually, he had to step back from his job as an engineer, and Katie had to drive him everywhere while trying to manage the kids’ schedules. She enrolled him in a trial at Johns Hopkins, but it didn’t seem to have much of an effect. He lost the ability to sense his left side. Soon, he could no longer speak.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobnf3001c3b83burfmkge@published" data-word-count="78">Kevin died in July 2018, two years after his first seizure. As the tumor spread throughout his brain, he qualified for a trial at MD Anderson Cancer Center, but Katie decided against it: “He was already in a wheelchair. He was in a diaper at that point, and I could not feasibly get him there.” She said she’d rather spend her final weeks with him at home than subject him to a treatment that likely would not work.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobnsl001e3b83skvrdl5p@published" data-word-count="61">When Maus started her Ph.D. in immunology a little more than 25 years ago, the idea that it could one day make brain tumors like Kevin’s disappear was laughable. “I was told that it was career suicide,” Maus said. “People had been trying for a hundred years to get the immune system to recognize cancer, and it was a dead end.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobnun001f3b833ljtn8cf@published" data-word-count="108">Maus is short and has an eager smile and dark, expressive eyebrows. When I met her at her lab at Mass General in a building one block from Boston Harbor, I got a sense of how she might have stuck it out despite the warnings from her colleagues. She was friendly but didn’t let me get away with being wrong, a practice seemingly honed from years of supervising Ph.D. students and postdocs. “Let me tweak that,” she would say back to me when I fumbled through a question about cellular biology. Her attraction to immunotherapy was simple: Because it <em>should</em> work, she was determined to make it work.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobo08001g3b83h06hbpos@published" data-word-count="76">Maus knew that though cancer has long confounded efforts to kill it, it has a vulnerability. Cancerous tissue can be a pinpoint or a swarm, but it is always made up of cells. And those cells have to be at least somewhat different from the other cells in the body, or they wouldn’t be cancer. If you could train the immune system’s T cells to recognize that difference, that would be the end of the disease.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobo63001h3b83tnb21537@published" data-word-count="59">Efforts to attain that goal have already reshaped oncology. Researchers have developed drugs that selectively bind to proteins in cancer cells, inactivating them (targeted therapies); they’ve discovered ways to attack tumors by modulating the body’s immune response (immune checkpoint inhibitors); and they’ve gotten good at growing white blood cells outside the body and reinfusing them to overwhelm a tumor.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobob7001i3b83o1je1qxz@published" data-word-count="120">Some of these approaches, while powerful, were a bit like flooding your house to get rid of the rats. What if we could hire an exterminator instead? Immunologists zeroed in on the T cell, learning how to manipulate its genetic code to prompt it to hunt for specific proteins on the surface of cancer cells; other changes made the T cells more active. This engineered T cell has a special name: a CAR-T cell. (car stands for “chimeric antigen receptor.” The receptor is what binds a T cell to a protein on a cell’s surface. Antigen is another name for that protein. And the chimera, in this case, is the hybrid between the T cell’s normal receptor and its genetically modified components.)</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobocy001j3b834o6bsb5g@published" data-word-count="62">A decade ago, when Maus was at the University of Pennsylvania, her mentor, the immunologist Carl June, developed an astonishingly effective CAR-T therapy for leukemia. In some forms of the disease, a class of white blood cells called B cells begins to divide rapidly. June and his team programmed their CAR-T cells to target a protein on the B cells’ surface called CD19.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjoboes001k3b83785rp1yn@published" data-word-count="95">The CAR-T cells did their job quickly and thoroughly, binding to CD19, eliminating the B cells, and curing the leukemia. Almost overnight, CAR-T cells became the most exciting technology in cancer. Today, more than 34,000 leukemia patients have received some form of CAR-T therapy, and there are some 1,100 different CAR-T trials underway around the world. Everyone working in June’s lab became cancer-world famous. (At a recent conference, a scientist who got up to speak after June told the audience he felt like he was “standing up to play the ukulele after the Rolling Stones.”)</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobon3001l3b8337l1tp4r@published" data-word-count="82">The biggest question in oncology today is whether this approach could also be used for solid tumors. Maus was one of dozens of specialists in immunotherapy who began looking for a suitable cancer for a new CAR-T trial. “I’m not an expert in any disease right now,” she told me, “but I think a lot about how to get T cells to do what we want them to do. The T cell is my hammer, and I’m on the lookout for nails.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobotp001m3b83s3saubtm@published" data-word-count="56">Glioblastoma, she knew, had a promising nail for the T-cell hammer: an antigen called epidermal-growth-factor-receptor variant III (EGFRvIII), which isn’t found in healthy brain tissue. In a clinical trial she began before moving to Mass General, she and a neurosurgeon at Penn named Donald O’Rourke gave patients intravenous injections of T cells engineered to target EGFRvIII.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobov5001n3b83gke5o4gd@published" data-word-count="85">The experiment was a failure. Some of the CAR-T cells made it to the patients’ brains, but they didn’t seem to have any effect on the tumor. By the time Maus set up her lab at Mass General in 2015, she had two ideas for how to improve the treatment, “one big one and one medium one.” The medium one was to infuse the T cells directly into the fluid surrounding the brain, which would, she hoped, allow more of them to reach the tumor.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjoboxu001o3b83lim1nfbm@published" data-word-count="91">The big idea was meant to address a separate problem. Glioblastoma, like most solid tumors, is heterogeneous. Different parts of the tumor have different proteins on the surface of their cells, which makes eliminating them by going after EGFRvIII alone impossible. Maus’s new CAR-T cell was engineered to secrete a molecule called a bispecific T-cell engager, which acted like a bit of double-sided tape, making it easier for T cells to bind to a second protein called wild-type EGFR. The approach, Maus said, was “as fine-tuned as I can possibly imagine.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjoboze001p3b83ouwnrpxp@published" data-word-count="43">Maus and Haber were at dinner when she showed him scans from the first patient. “The world stopped,” he said. The possibilities were immediately clear. “If it’s really working in glioblastoma,” he said, “does that open up the whole bandwidth of solid tumors?”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobp1c001q3b83yoge5c9r@published" data-word-count="106">Maus was quick to point out the limits of what this first phase of the trial has proved. The modified T cells were remarkably effective, but they also eventually disappeared, probably killed by the body’s own immune system. Of the three patients, one died from a perforated bowel, an adverse reaction to a medication he was taking. The second had a recurrence within months of the tumor vanishing. And even Fraser, who had the longest-lasting response, has recently seen signs that his cancer is starting to grow again. “I feel like this was a double or a triple,” Maus told me. “It’s not a home run.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobp33001r3b83ngn8nlyh@published" data-word-count="74">June’s assessment was more sanguine. He compared Maus’s experiment to his celebrated work with leukemia. It took just five years to get from their first promising results to FDA approval; today, thousands of patients have been effectively cured. “I think by 2029, we’re going to have FDA approval of CAR-T cells for glioblastoma,” he said. “It’s going to be a huge thing, and 2024 is going to be looked at as the breakthrough year.”</p>

  

  

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobp6e001t3b830mp146pj@published" data-word-count="80">Cancer researchers are fluent in the language of failure. The past century, divided in half by Richard Nixon’s declaration of a war on cancer in 1971, has been marked by frustrations and setbacks, approaches that should have worked but didn’t. Oncologists once thought they were treating a single disease. Now they know that no two types of cancer are alike. Indeed, the same cancer in two individuals can be wildly different. “Cancer,” Haber told me, “is as complicated as medicine.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobp7t001u3b83bjpty7ss@published" data-word-count="68">For all the promise of immunotherapy, there are formidable obstacles. The first of these is cost. At Maus’s lab, every device and every person represents tightly coiled helixes of time and money. There are PCR machines, biosafety cabinets, ELISA readers, autoclaves, freezers, cell counters, incubators, and centrifuges. The proliferation of white, boxy machines makes the space look like an open-floor-plan office with an unusual number of personal mini-fridges.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobp9b001v3b83myzw5e98@published" data-word-count="85">When I visited, many of the researchers on the floor (there are dozens of them — young, a mix of genders and races) were staring at computers. Others were busy at what we’d recognizably call lab work, transferring liquids from one container to another, moving things in and out of freezers, placing things under a microscope or removing them. The lab itself carries Maus’s affect: friendly but solemn, collegial but not disposed to gossip or chitchat. Nearly everyone has an M.D., a Ph.D., or both.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobpat001w3b836u5vahmt@published" data-word-count="133">Maus walked me through some of the steps needed to create CAR-T cells for the trial. We started with the room where the DNA instructions that are added to the T cell’s genome are written. (“I ran my first restriction digest on a DNA plasmid the summer after eighth grade,” Maus told me. “I was so excited. I didn’t sleep for two days afterward.”) We went on to the lentiviral-production room, where technicians create viral vectors carrying this DNA. From there, we moved to the tissue-culture room, where the vector is mixed with normal T cells to create the CAR-T. Finally, we visited the immune-monitoring part of the lab, where lab techs assay blood draws and other samples from patients, looking for proof that the CAR-T cells have made it to their targets.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobpc8001x3b83u4wtlozk@published" data-word-count="51">Maus calls the lab “as whole shebang as you can get.” The only part missing are the mice they use for testing; those are upstairs. Maus says she’s glad of that — she’s allergic to mice. It takes this whole apparatus, working together, weeks to create enough T cells for one infusion.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobpe5001y3b834vrzc76z@published" data-word-count="82">Jennifer Wargo, a professor of genomic medicine at MD Anderson, referred to the cost of immunotherapy treatments as “financial toxicity.” The patent for June’s CAR-T therapy for leukemia is owned by Novartis, and the median cost for the treatment is $620,000. Even if drug companies don’t try to profit from these therapies, the process is inherently labor-intensive: T cells have to be removed from the patient’s own blood, genetically altered, then reinfused. It’s difficult to determine where economies of scale might kick in.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobpft001z3b83vdg1yq2p@published" data-word-count="129">The complicated process of producing CAR-T cells also limits the number of people who can be treated. For an emerging therapy like CAR-T for glioblastoma, the restrictions are even greater. Over the past few months, I spoke with several patients searching for a trial that would take them on. ​​Michael McNally was diagnosed last summer, after he noticed a slight droop on the left side of his face. He went to Mass General, suspecting a mild stroke. After an MRI, the doctor told him he had a tumor in his right frontal lobe. “I said, ‘Look, we’re changing the rules here at Mass General,’” McNally said. If a doctor delivered news like that, “you better have a Redbreast whiskey in your right hand.” He had surgery two days later.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobphm00203b83z65ziair@published" data-word-count="91">McNally has gone through an exhaustive list of treatments trying to improve on the standard of care, including a personalized cancer vaccine. “If someone told me scorpion poison would kill it, I’d probably take it,” he said. “I’m a giant mouse; let’s go. Let’s do it.” He won’t be able, however, to enroll in Maus’s trial. Because they want to ensure that any positive outcome can be attributed to the CAR-T regime alone, the exclusion criteria rule out anyone who has been treated with “any prior gene-therapy or gene-modified cellular therapy.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobpz000213b839yxrxnov@published" data-word-count="121">Timing can be difficult for patients and their families to manage. After her father, Yuriy, was diagnosed with glioblastoma, Yelena Tsyrlin tried to enroll him in an immunotherapy trial right away, but she still missed the eligibility window. (She has since started the process to secure a spot in O’Rourke’s follow-up study to the one he conducted with Maus, which has also shown promising results.) Another caregiver wrote that her mother kept getting rejected from trials because she was still on hormone therapy for breast cancer, which she’d had more than five years earlier. “I understand the reasoning and the science behind these decisions,” she wrote, “but when you’re facing this as a patient or a family member, it feels cruel.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobq0n00223b83cplwnqoe@published" data-word-count="39">None of the oncologists I spoke with thought that immunotherapy would completely supplant proven approaches. Some cancers will still be best treated by surgery, others by radiation or chemotherapy. CAR-T therapy may be reserved for the most stubborn cancers.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobq2f00233b83k28pty5b@published" data-word-count="105">As more CAR-T treatments get FDA approval, however, cost and efficiency may improve. “You’re on the incipient curve of discovery,” Haber said, “but science builds on itself, and sometimes things that are incredibly complicated, expensive, and dangerous open the door to things that become much more democratic, affordable, and standard.” Researchers are looking at ways to use a virus to genetically modify T cells inside a patient’s body, effectively eliminating half of the steps Maus walked me through in her lab. Others are experimenting with vaccines that can teach the immune system to target the same kind of antigens that the CAR-T cells bind to.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobq4600243b83azrc2fha@published" data-word-count="52">Maus and Choi have already refined the protocol for their glioblastoma trial. Patients will now have a short run of chemotherapy before the infusion to limit the number of CAR-T cells killed or inactivated by the innate immune system, allowing more of them to remain active at the tumor site for longer.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobq6d00253b83xjwi42th@published" data-word-count="88">In our first conversation, I asked Maus if Mass General hired her because of the incredible results from the CAR-T therapies developed at Penn. She said they weren’t hiring a CAR-T specialist; they were hiring a T-cell specialist. The difference was meaningful. The CAR-T cell, as complicated as it is, is one expression of a much deeper knowledge. That may be how we ultimately reduce costs: The better we understand the immune system, the easier it will be to find ways to make it do what we want.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobq9l00273b83rer56qh1@published" data-word-count="119">On the first day of summer, I went to visit Tom Fraser, participant No. 2 in the trial, at his home outside Rochester. I had been warned that the cancer had made speaking difficult for him, and all my phone communications to that point had been with his wife, Debbie. After spending months talking to patients with glioblastoma and their families, I feared the worst. So it was a pleasant surprise to be greeted at the door by a tall, sturdy man with a shock of salt-and-pepper hair. “Welcome,” he said, shaking my hand. “I’m Tom Fraser.” He led me to his tidy kitchen, where we sat and talked for nearly two hours. The sun outside was almost unbearably bright.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqbe00283b83lzbls9cz@published" data-word-count="69">Before he retired, Tom led a forensic engineering firm. After some catastrophe, he’d be called in to determine its causes. When a Bethlehem Steel warehouse near Buffalo caught fire a few years ago, sending up a plume of smoke so large 300 households and several schools had to be evacuated, Tom determined that the culprit was an improperly installed lighting system that had thrown sparks onto flammable materials below.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqm800293b83x390t02f@published" data-word-count="62">He takes the same methodical approach to discussing the course of his disease, consulting a timeline he’s marked out on a legal pad. “I put some dates down here just so I can remember,” he told me. Sometimes Debbie, voluble where Tom was laconic, with a neatly trimmed gray bob, would interject. Tom would pause to listen, then return to his outline.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqnt002a3b836lzl5b0c@published" data-word-count="101">In August 2021, they were staying at their cottage in the Thousand Islands — a little white house perched on a rock in the Saint Lawrence River — when Tom first knew something was wrong. “I got up in the morning,” he said, “and I couldn’t read.” It took him a month to schedule an MRI, but once he did, the diagnosis arrived quickly. He’d never heard of glioblastoma, but his doctor was direct with him: Without treatment, he could die within six months. He and Debbie told their family — four daughters and eight grandchildren — the news over Zoom.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqpi002b3b837cn3ou51@published" data-word-count="63">One of Tom’s daughters works as a physician’s assistant at Mass General, and she encouraged him to travel there to get his tumor resected. His surgeon, Brian Nahed, needed nearly five hours to complete the operation. Tom showed me the scar, a horseshoe on the left side of his head. “It’s okay as long as I can comb my hair over it,” he said.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqr9002c3b83h3uganvx@published" data-word-count="88">After the surgery, he started radiation and chemotherapy, then underwent treatment by Optune, a device that uses electric fields to try to disrupt cell division. Nahed was frank about the likelihood of any of these approaches keeping the cancer in remission for long. “He said, ‘That’ll work until it doesn’t work,’” Debbie told me. “‘This is what happens. This heterogeneous cancer figures out ways. That’s what makes it so aggressive and so difficult to treat.’” Even so, when the cancer recurred after 20 months, the Frasers felt blindsided.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqsq002d3b83f4fxxhys@published" data-word-count="61">It was Nahed who suggested Tom enroll in the trial being run by his colleagues at Mass General, calling the Frasers at dinner on a Sunday night in the spring of 2023. His message was one of both caution and hope: There was no guarantee this treatment would work, but there was also no more promising trial anywhere in the world.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqui002e3b83tmkjgajw@published" data-word-count="61">On the day of the infusion in July 2023, 30 people crowded into the room with Tom and Debbie to watch. For all the time and money and innovation that went into producing that moment, the scene was oddly humble: a normal hospital room, Tom sitting up in his bed as a doctor wearing gloves pushed the plunger on a syringe.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqwz002f3b83uvvnjqt5@published" data-word-count="105">The next month was difficult. Even though the scans showed the tumor shrinking, matching the dramatic results from the first patient, the doctors were reluctant to read too much into them. “They really were very careful not to give us information, even though we were asking all the time,” Debbie said. In the weeks that followed, Tom suffered a cascade of complications: atrial fibrillation, mysterious infections, a punishing fever. The nurses swaddled him in blanket after blanket, but still he shook uncontrollably. Debbie kept watch 12 hours a day. Choi tried to reassure them that the effects were a sign that the treatment was working.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqyp002g3b83xmz7cjhh@published" data-word-count="72">“By the time I left,” Tom said, “I could hardly walk.” Debbie showed me a picture from that day. Tom looked feeble and miserable, “not himself,” in her words. “Let me see that,” Tom said, and Debbie turned the picture to him. “Oh,” he said. “That <em>is</em> not myself.” When they arrived back in New York, the grandchildren greeted them with a WELCOME HOME poster, a hand-drawn rainbow floating near the bottom.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobr0s002h3b83uwx7ojev@published" data-word-count="80">That fall, Tom felt strong enough to return to the family’s cottage in the Thousand Islands. He wanted to help power-wash the house, but Debbie overruled him. They knew nothing about participants Nos. 1 and 3 in the trial and precious little about Tom’s own prognosis. “We knew that things were stable, but we did not know the profound results,” Debbie said. That all changed when Maus and her team published the paper in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine.</em></p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobr2e002i3b83ft4kthnp@published" data-word-count="76">If CAR-T therapy for glioblastoma eventually becomes standard of care — if Maus and others can reproduce and improve on the results she got for Tom Fraser — his name will forever be tied with the birth of this treatment. “I shouldn’t say it, but I’m a little proud of myself,” Tom said. “There were three of us in the group, the first three to ever have it and try it. And I was the No. 2 guy.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobr9t002j3b8358gcqyz2@published" data-word-count="123">Hope can be a shot of adrenaline or the steady drip of an IV, but it’s always strong medicine. The intense days of those first incredible scans are long behind the Frasers; they have settled into a different rhythm recently, something approximating the way they were before the diagnosis. Tom has also shifted the way he talks about his disease. For years, he spoke about beating glioblastoma — finding a cure for himself. Now he’s more likely to refer to the patients who come after him, who will undoubtedly live longer because of what we’ve learned from his response to the CAR-T therapy. This spring, he packed up his library of engineering reference books and donated them to Clarkson College, his alma mater.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobrbf002k3b83pvufypo3@published" data-word-count="102">He might not be done with his fight yet, however. After a scan in February showed signs of recurrence, a new set of images taken in June showed just the opposite. The tumor had seemingly shrunk again. “I said, ‘Holy crap, I’m going to do a dance,’” Tom said. Now, according to Debbie, he’s in better shape than he’s been in months. Was it a temporary effect or a sign that the T cells were still active in his brain? We may only know years from now, and then only by implication, if a strong enough signal emerges from future CAR-T trials.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobrd1002l3b83q3tbxm5c@published" data-word-count="83">Tom’s next scan is not till August. In the meantime, he told me about a trip he and Debbie were planning: “I’ve never visited Chicago in my life. I said, ‘This is nuts. I want to see this place — so let’s go.’” That morning, they had been to their youngest grandson’s fifth-grade graduation. It was a hot day, and they sat sweating in the parking lot. It had been almost three years since he’d been told he might have six months to live.</p>

Their idea at the time was to invest in Web 2.0, meaning the nascent world of web apps. They built a few products at the time. One was an online classified ad service called Edge.io that was supposed to mimic Craigslist on every site on the web. The other was a startup tracking service called TechCrunch that aimed to review every Web 2.0 site popping up on the nascent Internet. Teare, for his part, focused on the startup while Arrington focused on the blog.</span></p><p><span>At the time, the media industry was being upended by bloggers who moved faster and wrote off-the-cuff stories about nearly everything, essentially beating print magazines to every punch. Along the way, they destroyed the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2008/12/17/death-to-the-embargo/" rel="">embargo system</a><span>, built the first influencers, gave rise to </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_Swisher" rel="">hagiographic access journalism</a><span>, turned true reviews into affiliate marketing plays, savaged advertising revenue, and threw traditional journalism into a death spiral whose crash is currently finalizing itself around the world. But, at the time, they were pretty cool.</span></p><p>Arrington spent most of his waking hours publishing Web 2.0 stories and asking his VC buddies for scoops. He monetized the site by selling square ads on the side of the page for a few thousand dollars a month, and emblazoned there were early come-ons for the same sites Arrington was reviewing. Eventually, those sponsors paid enough money to expand the site into multiple topics, including MobileCrunch and my site, CrunchGear.</p><p>I started CrunchGear for Mike in 2006. At this point, TechCrunch had eclipsed most of the rest of Archimedes Ventures, leaving Arrington to spend nearly every waking hour on TC. To cater to a global audience, he would stay up until three or four writing scoops about exciting new services like TWTR and Spotify and yelling loudly at Mark Hendrickson, a recent college grad who was imprisoned in Mike’s Palo Alto home. When I came by for my initial interview, I had to wake Mike up and he took me to CostCo to buy stuff for a party he was holding that night.</p><p>If you want to understand what life was like back then, blogger Om Malik suffered a heart attack from overwork (and too many cigars) while Arrington himself told the NYT that his lifestyle was awful:</p><p><em><span>“I haven’t died yet,” said Michael Arrington, the founder and co-editor of </span><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/" rel="">TechCrunch</a><span>, a popular technology blog. The site has brought in millions in advertising revenue, but there has been a hefty cost. Mr. Arrington says he has gained 30 pounds in the last three years, developed a severe sleeping disorder and turned his home into an office for him and four employees. “At some point, I’ll have a nervous breakdown and be admitted to the hospital, or something else will happen.”</span></em></p><p><em>“This is not sustainable,” he said.</em></p><p>TechCrunch was the definitive startup news site. To get on the front page - however briefly - meant 10,000 new signups to your service and countless calls from Valley VCs. That was TC’s power: it could make or break a site. This gave us silly kids an inordinate amount of power (and eventually led me to suffer a fairly debilitating depression) because startup founders needed us to close out their rounds. “Get a TC story,” the VCs would say, and founders would listen. One pair of Dutch entrepreneurs walked into Mike’s house with coffee, entering his bedroom in hopes of convincing him to write about whatever they were flogging. Legend has it that at one point an irate German entrepreneur spit on Mike at an event, leading us all to have a profound distrust of humanity.</p><p>The site flourished during the Web 3.0 and Mobile Web days and settled into a routine of startup news speckled with more hard-hitting investigations on privacy and hardware. It spawned the best startup event on the planet, Disrupt, and essentially defined how to pitch for tens of thousands of entrepreneurs. I personally ran pitch-offs around the world in bars and concert halls as a sort of scouting mechanism for TC. When I was doing this, during the early 2010s, TC was already becoming insular and SF-focused.</p><p>After the Great Recession, however, global startups and local U.S. startup hubs began producing some interesting things. The San Francisco-focused writers often ignored these startups simply because they didn’t get that innovation could happen anywhere outside of the Mission. I called myself the East Coast Editor and said that my beat was everything outside San Francisco.</p><p>This was TC’s first mistake.</p><p>To populate Disrupt with startups, it needed to bring in hopefuls from outside the Valley. Sure, you could bring Zuckerberg up from Palo Alto to speak, but smaller companies from places like Paris, Chicago, and Tel Aviv were the real customers. These folks, ignored by nearly everyone, felt they could get a fair hearing at Disrupt and on the pages of TechCrunch. Little did they know that the SF crew mostly cared about Uber’s next round of investment, while folks like myself and Mike Butcher brought the TC gospel to people who yearned to be noticed.</p><p>This effort turned into a grind. I’d fly into a city, get to the hotel, eat and drink too much, and then get cornered for five hours at an event where I drank even more. We’d hold a pitch-off with a few local startups and VCs and then run around Yount or Dizengoff Street until the wee hours, drunk on gin and tonics and power. We were kingmakers, after all.</p><p>This was TC’s second mistake.</p><p>TC squandered this power. The SF crew, now run by AOL and Yahoo overlords, were focused on everything except startups. Traffic was paramount and ad sales were vital, so niche startup posts, posts that everyone once read but were now read by the company, lost their value. Over time, the value of a traditional TC story waned. Sites liked ProductHunt - which the bosses at TC were thinking of buying - eclipsed the power of a TC post. PR got expensive, so companies used guerrilla tactics to raise their user counts and more cash. VCs grew more savvy and created their own pitch-offs and accelerators to build bigger portfolios. The kingmakers were no longer in charge. Further, mainstream news was covering startups, too, focusing on cool new sites and gadgets.</p><p>As an aside, have you ever wondered why gadget sites suck now? You can thank the guy who replaced me at Gizmodo before I started CrunchGear, Brian Lam. Lam hit on the exciting concept that he should be paid for every widget one of his reviews sold, which led to affiliate marketing and, in turn, turned gadget review sites into churnalistic slop. In fact, his concept, one that ravaged sites like Engadget and CrunchGear, is directly responsible for the fact that outlets like New York Magazine were writing SEO-larded reviews of audio soundbars and TVs so they could get a 2% cut on every sale. Afflicting the comfortable, indeed.</p><p><span>But one thing TC always had was an edge. Arrington was often gleefully mean to startups that didn't live up to their promises. He called out Twitter for being down and essentially invented the “</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2008/04/06/comcast-twitter-and-the-chicken-trust-me-i-have-a-point/" rel="">complain on social media</a><span>” method of getting better customer service. At CrunchGear, we skewered things we thought were bad, called out bad actors, and did awful stuff like having Hitler complain about a new, overhyped tablet being late to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/24/hitler-discusses-the-notion-ink-adam-delays/#!" rel="">market</a><span>:</span></p><div id="youtube2-js7awHyFwKI" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;js7awHyFwKI&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/js7awHyFwKI?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>All that went away as bosses from Yahoo tried to understand how to milk even more cash out of TC’s events division while shutting down its multimedia efforts. Editor Matthew Panzarino did an admirable job of negotiating those shoals by keeping the suits out of the organization, but after he left they rushed in to fill Panzer’s glad-handing void. The result is TC’s third and final mistake.</p><p>After years of corporate ownership, culminating in Yahoo’s sale to private equity firm Apollo, TC has become a milquetoast site focused on big raises specially placed by expensive PR people and random tech news that has been neutered into pablum. The current editorial structure, controlled by one or two old-guard TCers and a lot of older editors hired by editor Connie Loizos. The once-freewheeling editorial strategy - writers wrote what they wanted at any time and nobody really edited anything - is being replaced by a more formalized system familiar to those who are one job away from become PR people themselves, while any hint of anger against the current crop of boy-kings in SF is dealt with harshly.</p><p><span>This all leads to what happened recently at TC. </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hjkamps/overlay/about-this-profile/" rel="">Haje Kamps</a><span> (who was, incidentally, running a side business advising startups, something that would have gotten him canned in previous incarnations of TC but was ignored because the wall between VC and editorial has been worn down to a nub) wrote about the lie of Alexandr Wang’s take on DEI vs. meritocracy. In a post that has since been toned down, Haje argued that Wang was a wang.</span></p><p><em><span>I just came off recording an </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/podcast/ai-powered-drug-development-vw-teams-up-with-rivian-and-dei-is-bad/" rel="">episode of Equity</a><span>, where I learned about the newest wave of stupidity. The tech industry’s DEI allergy has hit a new low, as Silicon Valley leaders are once again waving their “meritocracy” banners high and wide. Scale AI’s Alexandr Wang has decided that diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are passé — and replaced them with his shiny new acronym MEI: merit, excellence, and intelligence. I cringed so hard I’m going to need a chiropractor.</span></em></p><p>DEI has long been a dangerous thing in the valley, primarily because the Valley is primarily run by white dudes. These white dudes, who got lucky once or twice and are worth billions, think everyone could be like them with just a little elbow grease and grit. After all, little Mark Zuckerberg pulled himself up by his bootstraps while hanging out in the dorms at Harvard and poor Travis Kalanick invented Uber when he was having a hard time finding a cab to go to a party in Paris. Meanwhile, the only notable entrepreneur to do jail time for defrauding investors was Elizabeth Holmes and the African-American founders of MoviePass were pushed out of the company by a lucky white dude.</p><p><span>White dude CEOs like </span><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company" rel="">Brian Armstrong</a><span> and Jesse Powell came out hard against DEI efforts and even </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kraken-crypto-ceo-jesse-powell-does-not-regret-offending-anyone-2022-7" rel="">paid employees to leave,</a><span> which led, incidentally, to morale at their companies so low it could be measured in millisieverts. But they were making money, baby, so it was all good.</span></p><p>So, by all measures, Alexandr Wang’s MEI bullshit was just that, bullshit. And Haje, speaking in a voice that once rang out of the old TechCrunch like a clarion, called him out. The resulting Twitter backlash spooked Loizos and Haje was dumped from the roster a few months after another group of OG TCers, including Catherine Shu, Matt Burns, and Darrell Etherington - were laid off. This trio alone were responsible for a good percentage of TC’s global traffic because they were still writing interesting things and had been for nearly two decades. Also laid off was a large number of the marketing team. In short, TC is contracting and getting scared.</p><p>Loizos has to earn out her buy-out, and her new editors, refugees from the great business news layoffs of the 2020s, are hungry to stay relevant. The site itself is global, but news sits on the page for hours instead of minutes, and the value of the site is in the toilet.</p><p><span>I talk to VCs and startup founders all the time on </span><a href="https://keepgoingpod.com/" rel="">Keep Going</a><span> and all of them say the same thing: they don’t read TC. The value to their businesses is simply gone, and the current story roster - from press releases like </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/capcut-will-stop-offering-free-cloud-storage-from-august-5/" rel="">CapCut</a><span> making a policy change to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/10/facebook-to-face-of-crypto-anthony-pompliano-wild-career/" rel="">glowing VC interviews</a><span> with some of the same odious men who believe in MEI - is junk. There are still plenty of people I consider friends and confidants on staff, and I know not every story is garbage. Sometimes </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/a-vc-told-keely-cat-wells-to-get-a-male-able-bodied-co-founder-she-balked-nabbed-a-2m-seed-round/" rel="">gold still shines through</a><span> (but even in this case the article is too long by half, something one of those vaunted editors should have caught). But in the end, TC is no longer relevant.</span></p><p>Here’s the saddest thing: it should be. Startups haven’t gone away. Any media startup could essentially recreate Arrington’s model and start selling little ads while profiling startups. Fun can be had poking holes in Valley blowhards, and there could be reams of content to be had by telling people how to be successful in startup land. But TC won’t do that anymore. It is stuck, churning through releases from the same pushy Valley PR people and thinking they’re doing good work when they simply aren’t.</p><p>What would I do? Bring back a global focus to startup coverage, ignore the PR people flogging minor updates to already popular services, and become the place where VCs go to figure out where to invest. This was TC’s original magic. By reducing the editors, who are currently awash in posts and unable to keep up, to give TC back some of its vitality. And they’d get bonus points for making money from events again and pulling themselves out from under the boulder of private equity.</p><p>I don’t write those words without sadness. Knowing what could have been had TC not climbed up its own backside makes me mad. An industry that once grew and changed and embraced nearly everyone before contracting into a black hole of Valley douchery is now holding the reins to its only source of criticism and celebration. TC isn’t a news site. It’s a corpse.</p><p>That’s its final failure.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The enduring legacy of Euclidean geometry underpins classical machine learning, which, for decades, has been primarily developed for data lying in Euclidean space. Yet, modern machine learning increasingly encounters richly structured data that is inherently nonEuclidean. This data can exhibit intricate geometric, topological and algebraic structure: from the geometry of the curvature of space-time, to topologically complex interactions between neurons in the brain, to the algebraic transformations describing symmetries of physical systems. Extracting knowledge from such non-Euclidean data necessitates a broader mathematical perspective. Echoing the 19th-century revolutions that gave rise to non-Euclidean geometry, an emerging line of research is redefining modern machine learning with non-Euclidean structures. Its goal: generalizing classical methods to unconventional data types with geometry, topology, and algebra. In this review, we provide an accessible gateway to this fast-growing field and propose a graphical taxonomy that integrates recent advances into an intuitive unified framework. We subsequently extract insights into current challenges and highlight exciting opportunities for future development in this field.

												<p>At least a dozen organizations with domain names at domain registrar <strong>Squarespace</strong> saw their websites hijacked last week. Squarespace bought all assets of <strong>Google Domains</strong> a year ago, but many customers still haven’t set up their new accounts. Experts say malicious hackers learned they could commandeer any migrated Squarespace accounts that hadn’t yet been registered, merely by supplying an email address tied to an existing domain.</p>

<p>The Squarespace domain hijacks, which took place between July 9 and July 12, appear to have mostly targeted cryptocurrency businesses, including <a href="https://twitter.com/CelerNetwork/status/1811394743794114866" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celer Network</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/compoundfinance/status/1811624013841727702" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compound Finance</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/pendle_fi/status/1811683909509558562" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pendle Finance</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@theporpoise/our-domain-was-hijacked-heres-how-blockchain-can-prevent-this-from-happening-to-you-9b9696d80d07" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unstoppable Domains</a>. In some cases, the attackers were able to redirect the hijacked domains to phishing sites set up to steal visitors’ cryptocurrency funds.</p>
<p>New York City-based <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Squarespace</a> purchased roughly 10 million domain names from Google Domains in June 2023, and it has been gradually migrating those domains to its service ever since. Squarespace has not responded to a request for comment, nor has it issued a statement about the attacks.</p>
<p>But an analysis released by security experts at <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metamask</a> and <a href="https://x.com/samczsun/status/1811367830564307451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paradigm</a> finds the most likely explanation for what happened is that Squarespace assumed all users migrating from Google Domains would select the social login options — such “Continue with Google” or “Continue with Apple” — as opposed to the “Continue with email” choice.</p>
<p><strong>Taylor Monahan</strong>, lead product manager at Metamask, said Squarespace never accounted for the possibility that a threat actor might sign up for an account using an email associated with a recently-migrated domain before the legitimate email holder created the account themselves.</p>
<p>“Thus nothing actually stops them from trying to login with an email,” Monahan told KrebsOnSecurity. “And since there’s no password on the account, it just shoots them to the ‘create password for your new account’ flow. And since the account is half-initialized on the backend, they now have access to the domain in question.”</p>
<p>What’s more, Monahan said, Squarespace did not require email verification for new accounts created with a password.</p>
<p>“The domains being migrated from Google to Squarespace are known,” Monahan said. “It’s either public or easily discernible info which email addresses have admin of a domain. And if that email never sets up their account on Squarespace — say because the billing admin left the company five years ago or folks just ignored the email — anyone who enters that email@domain in the squarespace form now has full access to control to the domain.”<span id="more-68067"></span></p>
<p>The researchers say some Squarespace domains that were migrated over also could be hijacked if attackers discovered the email addresses for less privileged user accounts tied to the domain, such as “domain manager,” which likewise has the ability to transfer a domain or point it to a different Internet address.</p>
<div id="attachment_68074"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68074" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/squarespaceusers.png" alt="" width="750" height="822"></p><p id="caption-attachment-68074">Squarespace says domain owners and domain managers have many of the same privileges, including the ability to move a domain or manage the site’s domain name server (DNS) settings.</p></div>
<p>Monahan said the migration has left domain owners with fewer options to secure and monitor their accounts.</p>
<p>“Squarespace can’t support users who need any control or insight into the activity being performed in their account or domain,” Monahan said. “You basically have no control over the access different folks have. You don’t have any audit logs. You don’t get email notifications for some actions. The owner doesn’t get email notification for actions taken by a ‘domain manager.’ This is absolutely insane if you’re used to and expecting the controls Google provides.”</p>
<p>The researchers have published <a href="https://securityalliance.notion.site/A-Squarespace-Retrospective-or-How-to-Coordinate-an-Industry-Wide-Incident-Response-fead693b66c14543a48283d85aec19ad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a comprehensive guide</a> for locking down Squarespace user accounts, which urges Squarespace users to enable multi-factor authentication (disabled during the migration).</p>
<p>“Determining what emails have access to your new Squarespace account is step 1,” the help guide advises. “Most teams DO NOT REALIZE these accounts even exist, let alone theoretically have access.”</p>
<p>The guide also recommends removing unnecessary Squarespace user accounts, and disabling reseller access in Google Workspace.</p>
<p>“If you bought Google Workspace via Google Domains, Squarespace is now your authorized reseller,” the help document explains. “This means that anyone with access to your Squarespace account also has a backdoor into your Google Workspace unless you explicitly disable it by following the instructions here, which you should do. It’s easier to secure one account than two.”</p>

        <p>In 1904, a widow named <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.buffalo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=journal_articles">Elizabeth Peck</a> had her portrait taken at a studio in a small Iowa town. The photographer sold the negatives to Duffy’s Pure Malt Whiskey, a company that avoided liquor taxes for years by <a href="https://digitalchicagohistory.org/items/show/677">falsely advertising</a> its product as medicinal. Duffy’s ads claimed the fantastical: that it cured everything from influenza to consumption, that it was endorsed by clergymen, that it could help you live until the age of 106. The portrait of Peck ended up in one of these <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/214/185">dubious ads</a>, published in newspapers across the country alongside what appeared to be her <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-spokane-press-too-funny-to-not-clip/32975454/">unqualified praise</a>: “After years of constant use of your Pure Malt Whiskey, both by myself and as given to patients in my capacity as nurse, I have no hesitation in recommending it.”</p>

<p>Duffy’s lies were numerous. Peck (misleadingly identified as “Mrs. A. Schuman”) was not a nurse, and she had not spent years constantly slinging back malt beverages. In fact, she fully abstained from alcohol. Peck never consented to the ad.</p>

<p>The camera’s first great age—which began in <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/invention-snapshot-changed-way-we-viewed-world-180952435/">1888</a> when <a href="https://www.kodak.com/en/company/page/george-eastman-history/">George Eastman</a> debuted the Kodak—is full of stories like this one. Beyond the wonders of a quickly developing art form and technology lay widespread lack of control over one’s own image, perverse incentives to make a quick buck, and generalized fear at the prospect of humiliation and the invasion of privacy.</p>

<p>Prior to 1888, cameras often existed in a realm of mystical unknowability. In one famed <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/490042?searchText=&amp;searchUri=&amp;ab_segments=&amp;searchKey=&amp;refreqid=fastly-default%3A4f12142dae9e22e72de48c8194abc75c">story</a> from the early days of photography, a man asks for a picture of his recently buried wife, not understanding that someone must be present in order to be photographed. The French writer Honoré de Balzac <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/teachers/2018/09/pre-civil-war-photographic-technologies-the-calotype-and-daguerreotype/">confessed</a> to fearing that each time a daguerreotype was taken of him, a layer of his skin would be peeled off. Early cameras required a level of technical mastery that evoked mystery—a scientific instrument understood only by professionals.</p>

<p>All of that changed when Eastman invented flexible roll film and debuted the first Kodak camera. Instead of developing their own pictures, customers could mail their devices to the Kodak factory and have their rolls of film developed, printed, and replaced. “You press the button,” Kodak ads <a href="https://www.cameramuseum.ch/en/discover/permanent-exhibition/the-century-of-the-film/you-press-the-button-we-do-the-rest/">promised</a>, “we do the rest.” This leap from obscure science to streamlined service forever transformed the nature of looking and being looked at.</p>

<p>By 1905, less than 20 years after the first Kodak camera debuted, Eastman’s company had <a href="https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/1967/">sold</a> 1.2 million devices and persuaded nearly a third of the United States’ population to take up photography. Kodak’s record-setting yearly ad spending—$750,000 by the end of the 19th century (roughly $28 million in today’s dollars)—and the rapture of a technology that scratched a timeless itch facilitated the onset of a new kind of mass exposure.</p>

<p>“The impulse to peer into others’ affairs—an age-old feature of village life—had never actually subsided,” writes historian <a href="https://as.vanderbilt.edu/history/bio/sarah-igo/">Sarah E. Igo</a> in <em><a href="https://amzn.to/4cq10GK"><em>The Known Citizen: A History of Privacy in Modern America</em></a></em>. Photography became such a phenomenon that “<a href="https://historicpittsburgh.org/islandora/object/pitt:20100623-ocl-1093">Kodak fiends</a>,” a phrase used to describe those seduced by the devilish pleasures of photography, entered the vernacular.</p>

<p>No one quite knew what to make of or how to control the fiendishness, and privacy was further unspooled by money-making schemes just as ferociously inventive as the new technology.</p>

<p>The same year Kodak cameras hit the marketplace, the<em> </em><a href="https://bklyn.newspapers.com/article/the-brooklyn-daily-eagle/1768668/"><em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em></a><em> </em>reported that Anthony Comstock—the anti-obscenity crusader after whom the 1873 <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/comstock-act-transform-abortion-debate-180982363/">Comstock Act</a> is named—had arrested an amateur photographer for selling manually photoshopped pictures that placed “the heads of innocent women on the undraped bodies of other females.” In 1890, a mugshot photographer for the New York Police Department was fired for selling copies of the mugshots to arrestees themselves—an arrangement the<em> </em><a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/08/03/106040745.html?pageNumber=15"><em>New York Times</em></a> described as a “lucrative business.” Boundless <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/how-camera-introduced-americans-their-heroines-180972526/">fascination</a> with photographs <a href="https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/379994">created</a> a bustling economy. People bought and collected random photographs from dry goods stores, general junk shops, vending machines and even cigarette packs. Demand was so robust that amateurs were just as able to sell to this market as professionals.</p>

<p>The ubiquity of advertising by the end of the 19th century only intensified this demand. “As the growth in productive capacity outpaced the needs of the population, commercial entrepreneurs became obsessed with creating demand for consumer products,” writes historian <a href="https://www.law.buffalo.edu/faculty/facultyDirectory/barbasSamantha.html">Samantha Barbas</a> in <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3W89759">Laws of Image: Privacy and Publicity in America</a></em>. “The key agent in this project was advertising.”</p>

<p>By 1900, photography began to replace earlier image-making methods as the ad technology of choice. Photos of women were especially desirable, given their association with respectability and the belief that a pretty face could sell anything. But dominant values around modesty, avoiding indulgence and anti-consumerism meant that most people had no desire to be featured in an advertisement. Commercial modeling and stock photos did not yet exist. Faced with few choices, advertisers resorted to backdoor purchases. In an arrangement Barbas dubs “the crisis of the ‘circulating portrait,’” advertisers began buying portraits from photographers without the permission of the photos’ subjects—as was the case with Peck, temperate widow turned whiskey hound by the magic and obfuscation of advertising.</p>

<p>It wasn’t just ordinary people who found themselves newly exposed. Mass photography was an equalizer twice over: Nearly anybody could use a camera, and nearly anybody might be violated by one. To their grave displeasure, even the elite were unable to assert control over the frenzy. The <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/04/12/101988760.html?pageNumber=6"><em>New York Times</em></a> reported that President Theodore Roosevelt was “known to exhibit impatience on discovering designs to Kodak him”; the same column mentioned that Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt horsewhipped a man he alleged took a picture of him without permission.</p>

<p>Though newspapers across the country <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2712965">cautioned</a> Americans to “beware the Kodak,” as the cameras were “deadly weapons” and “deadly little boxes,” many were also primary facilitators of the craze. The perfection of halftone printing coincided with the rise of the Kodak and allowed for the mass circulation of images. Newly empowered, newspapers regularly published paparazzi pictures of famous people taken without their knowledge, paying twice as much for them as they did for consensual photos taken in a studio.</p>

<p>Lawmakers and judges responded to the crisis clumsily. Suing for libel was usually the only remedy available to the overexposed. But libel law did not protect against your likeness being taken or used without your permission unless the violation was also defamatory in some way. Though results were middling, one failed lawsuit gained enough notoriety to channel cross-class feelings of exposure into action. A teenage girl named <a href="https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/columnists/memmott/2019/01/15/abigail-roberson-privacy/2577870002/">Abigail Roberson</a> noticed her face on a neighbor’s bag of flour, only to learn that the Franklin Mills Flour Company had used her likeness in an ad that had been plastered 25,000 times all over her hometown.</p>

<p>After suffering intense shock and being temporarily bedridden, she sued. In 1902, the New York Court of Appeals rejected her claims and held that the right to privacy did not exist in common law. It based its decision in part on the assertion that the image was not libelous; Chief Justice Alton B. Parker wrote that the photo was “a very good one” that others might even regard as a “compliment to their beauty.” The humiliation, the lack of control over her own image, the unwanted fame—none of that amounted to any sort of actionable claim.</p>

<p>Public outcry at the decision reached a fever pitch, and newspapers <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/democrat-and-chronicle/23312379/">filled</a> <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/democrat-and-chronicle/23312417/">their pages</a> with editorial indignation. In its first legislative session following the court’s decision and the ensuing outrage, the New York state legislature <a href="https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3414&amp;context=faculty_scholarship">made history</a> by adopting a narrow “right to privacy,” which prohibited the use of someone’s likeness in advertising or trade without their written consent. Soon after, the Supreme Court of Georgia became the first to <a href="https://casetext.com/case/pavesich-v-new-england-life-ins-co">recognize</a> this category of privacy claim. Eventually, just about every state court in the country followed Georgia’s lead. The early uses and abuses of the Kodak helped cobble together a right that centered on profiting from the exploitation of someone’s likeness, rather than the exploitation itself.</p>

<p>Not long after asserting that no right to privacy exists in common law, and while campaigning to be the Democratic nominee for president, Parker told the Associated Press, “I reserve the right to put my hands in my pockets and assume comfortable attitudes without being everlastingly afraid that I shall be snapped by some fellow with a camera.” Roberson publicly took him to task over his hypocrisy, <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1904/07/27/117944284.html?pageNumber=1">writing</a>, “I take this opportunity to remind you that you have no such right.” She was correct then, and she still would be today. The question of whether anyone has the right to be free from exposure and its many humiliations lingers, intensified but unresolved. The law—that reactive, slow thing—never quite catches up to technology, whether it’s been given one year or 100.</p>

However, scientists in New Zealand may have finally caught a break.</p><p>The country's conservation agency said Monday a creature that washed up on a South Island beach this month is believed to be a spade-toothed whale. The five-meter-long creature, a type of beaked whale, was identified after it washed ashore on Otago beach from its color patterns and the shape of its skull, beak and teeth </p><p>"We know very little, practically nothing" about the creatures, Hannah Hendriks, Marine Technical Advisor for the Department of Conservation, told The Associated Press. "This is going to lead to some amazing science and world-first information."</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/15/354ba1f0-66a3-42f2-a66a-fbaf65f30d00/thumbnail/620x413/9f447d5bdb8d6d69eeed56b8bdef6947/ap24197315432718.jpg?v=5710b2ed1cee1bdfd30cb9c02455b43d#" alt="New Zealand Whale " height="413" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/15/354ba1f0-66a3-42f2-a66a-fbaf65f30d00/thumbnail/620x413/9f447d5bdb8d6d69eeed56b8bdef6947/ap24197315432718.jpg?v=5710b2ed1cee1bdfd30cb9c02455b43d 1x, https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/15/354ba1f0-66a3-42f2-a66a-fbaf65f30d00/thumbnail/1240x826/1fb0d339f542e565c861bc311bda306e/ap24197315432718.jpg?v=5710b2ed1cee1bdfd30cb9c02455b43d 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E"></span>

  <p>Only six other spade-toothed whales have ever been pinpointed, and those found intact on New Zealand's North Island beaches had been buried before DNA testing could verify their identification, Hendriks said, thwarting any chance to study them. </p><p>This time, the beached whale was quickly transported to cold storage and researchers will work with local Māori iwi (tribes) to plan how it will be examined, the conservation agency said. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<p><ctime>03 Jun 2022</ctime></p>
<p><code>strlcpy(3)</code> is an OpenBSD function which is often hailed as a safer
replacement for <code>strcpy(3)</code> and/or <code>strncpy(3)</code>. One of the obvious issues with
strlcpy is that it's not safe if <code>src</code> isn't null-terminated. However, that's
not the reason I don't like strlcpy. In fact despite knowing this, I used to
think it was an okay function and better than the (thought of) alternative
<code>strncpy</code> (which doesn't null-terminate in case of truncation).</p>
<p>The reason why I'm not a fan of it is because I've recently revisited this
<a href="https://sourceware.org/legacy-ml/libc-alpha/2000-08/msg00053.html">old thread</a>
where Ulrich Drepper rejects the proposal to add strlcpy to glibc.
His reasoning was:</p>
<ul>
<li>strlcpy is inefficient (which is unarguably true).</li>
<li>Anyone who has thought about the problem for a single second wouldn't use strlcpy
(<a href="https://sourceware.org/legacy-ml/libc-alpha/2000-08/msg00061.html">paraphrased</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>So I decided to spent a single second thinking about the problem and realized
that yup, there's no reason to be using strlcpy.</p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-is-the-problem">What exactly is the problem?<a href="#what-exactly-is-the-problem"><img src="https://nrk.neocities.org/assets/chain.svg"></a></h2>
<p>In order to understand why a solution isn't good or optimal, one first needs to
properly understand what the problem actually is. The problem we have in our
hands is that we're trying to copy a "c-string" or a "null-terminated string"
<sup><a id="info-src-0" href="#info-ref-0"><img src="https://nrk.neocities.org/assets/info.svg" width="12px"></a></sup>.</p>
<p>This problem can be divided into two main categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cases where truncation matters.</li>
<li>Cases where truncation doesn't matter.</li>
</ol>
<hr><div id="info-ref-0"><p><a href="#info-src-0"><img src="https://nrk.neocities.org/assets/info.svg"></a></p><p>Strictly speaking, the C standard <a href="https://port70.net/~nsz/c/c99/n1256.html#7.1.1">defines a string as</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A string is a contiguous sequence of characters terminated by and including
the first null character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the term "null-terminated string" is redundant since if it isn't
null-terminated, it's not a string according to the C standard.</p>
</div><hr>
<h2 id="truncation-doesn-t-matter">Truncation doesn't matter<a href="#truncation-doesn-t-matter"><img src="https://nrk.neocities.org/assets/chain.svg"></a></h2>
<p>There are many cases where truncation doesn't matter. For example, if we're
trying to display the result on some statusbar which can only hold, let's say 64
bytes, then not only is the <code>src</code> string getting truncated is not an issue,
it's actually wanted since it makes no sense to copy more than that.</p>
<p>So assuming <code>buf</code> is a fixed length array, <code>char buf[64]</code>; an strlcpy call would
look like the following:</p>
<pre><code>strlcpy(buf, src, sizeof buf);
</code></pre>
<p>If you spend a single second thinking about what you've just done, you'd realize
that this is a horribly inefficient solution to the problem at hand. Since
strlcpy returns <code>strlen(src)</code>, and <code>src</code> might very well be let's say a
thousands byte long. By using strlcpy, you are going though all of those bytes
in a O(n) strlen call for absolutely no reason when all you really cared about
is the first 64 bytes of <code>src</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly, <code>strncpy(3)</code> is also not a good solution in this case because:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>It doesn't null-terminate in case of truncation.</li>
<li>It unnecessarily pads the rest of <code>dst</code> with 0 in case <code>src</code> length happens
to be less than <code>dst</code> length.</li>
</ol>
<p>A much better solution here is using <code>memccpy(3)</code> instead, which will only scan
the first 64 bytes of <code>src</code> at most and nothing past that:</p>
<pre><code>if (memccpy(buf, src, '\0', sizeof buf) == NULL)
    buf[sizeof buf - 1] = '\0'; /* truncation occured, null-terminate manually. */
</code></pre>
<p>And in case you're worried about this being two-liners as opposed to a
one-liner strlcpy call (which is a valid criticism, as that can open up room
for making mistake), then you can (and should) simply turn this two liner into
a wrapper function. Optionally giving it a <code>_trunc</code> prefix to make it clear
that truncation is desired here.</p>
<pre><code>mystrcpy_trunc(buf, src, sizeof buf);
</code></pre>
<p>Not only is this more efficient, it makes it clear that truncation is desired
here just by looking at the function name. Whereas in the case of an unchecked
<code>strlcpy</code> call it's not immediately obvious weather truncation is desired or
the programmer forgot to check for it.</p>
<!-- 	void -->
<!-- 	my_strncpy(char *d, const char *s, size_t n) -->
<!-- 	{ -->
<!-- 		if (memccpy(d, s, '\0', n) == NULL) -->
<!-- 			d[n - 1] = '\0'; -->
<!-- 	} -->
<h2 id="truncation-matters">Truncation matters<a href="#truncation-matters"><img src="https://nrk.neocities.org/assets/chain.svg"></a></h2>
<p>In cases where truncation matters, for example file-path, url etc, you simply
<strong>SHOULD NOT</strong> be using a fixed size buffer. You have to be able to do dynamic
allocation and grow the buffer as needed.</p>
<p>The most simplest way of achieving this is just using <code>strdup(3)</code>, which will do
the allocation for us:</p>
<pre><code>char *s = strdup(src);
if (s == NULL)
    return ERROR;
/* do stuff with s */
free(s); /* don't forget to free */
</code></pre>
<p>And in case you already have an allocated buffer and you'd like to reuse it, the
following is what an strlcpy usage would looks like; assuming <code>char *dbuf</code> is a
buffer that's been allocated <code>size_t dbuflen</code> bytes via <code>malloc(3)</code>:</p>
<pre><code>size_t srclen = strlcpy(dbuf, src, dbuflen) + 1;
if (srclen &gt; dbuflen) {
    char *tmp = realloc(dbuf, srclen);
    if (tmp == NULL) {
        free(dbuf);
        return ERROR;
    }
    dbuf = tmp;
    dbuflen = srclen;
    strlcpy(dbuf, src, dbuflen);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's ignore just how inefficient this is for the moment, instead I'd like to
point out just how schizo this entire logic is:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Hmm yes, let me just start copying this string without knowing if it's going
to fit inside my buffer or not."</li>
<li>"Oh shit, it didn't fit. Let me just readjust the buffer and restart the copy
entirely."</li>
</ul>
<p>A much better solution here is to just use <code>strlen(3)</code> and <code>memcpy(3)</code>:</p>
<pre><code>size_t srclen = strlen(src) + 1;
if (srclen &gt; dbuflen) {
    void *tmp = realloc(dbuf, srclen);
    if (tmp == NULL) {
        free(dbuf);
        return ERROR;
    }
    dbuf = tmp;
    dbuflen = srclen;
}
memcpy(dbuf, src, srclen);
</code></pre>
<p>This version is far more efficient than the strlcpy version. But more
importantly, the logic here is much more sane and natural:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's find out how big the <code>src</code> is.</li>
<li>If it doesn't fit then grow the buffer.</li>
<li>Then copy everything over.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's not talk about how you got yourself into this situation, but instead let's
talk about what you can actually do here. And pretty much the only thing you
<em>can</em> do here, is to error out if <code>src</code> happens to be bigger than your buffer.</p>
<p>The following would be the strlcpy implementation:</p>
<pre><code>if (strlcpy(buf, src, sizeof buf) &gt;= sizeof buf)
    return ERROR; /* or call exit/abort if appropriate */
</code></pre>
<p>And once again, this is horribly inefficient because we don't want to know the
exact length of <code>src</code>, we only want to know if it's bigger than our buffer size
or not.</p>
<p>A much better way to do that is, once again, using memccpy. Which is not only
much faster than strlcpy, it actually makes much more logical sense for what
we're trying to do, as it won't scan <code>src</code> for more than <code>sizeof buf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if (memccpy(buf, src, '\0', sizeof buf) == NULL)
    return ERROR; /* truncation */
</code></pre>
<h2 id="b-but-using-mem-functions-on-string-is-bad">B-but using mem* functions on string is... bad!<a href="#b-but-using-mem-functions-on-string-is-bad"><img src="https://nrk.neocities.org/assets/chain.svg"></a></h2>
<p>The <code>mem</code> and <code>str</code> prefix is often a source of confusion for amateur
programmers who get tricked into thinking that you MUST use only <code>str*</code>
functions on strings.</p>
<p>In case you've forgotten what a (c-)string is, it's nothing more than an array
of bytes terminated by a null character. Any attempt of trying to think of them
as anything else is going to result in error sooner or later because the
programmer has a fundamental misunderstanding of what a string even is.</p>
<p>Moreover, where exactly are these <code>mem*</code> functions declared? Let's take a look
at the manpage:</p>
<pre><code>$ man 3 memccpy
SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;string.h&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's take a look at what the <a href="https://port70.net/~nsz/c/c99/n1256.html#7.21">C standard</a>
has to say about <code>&lt;string.h&gt;</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The header string.h declares one type and several functions, and defines one
macro useful for manipulating arrays of character type and other objects
treated as arrays of character type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, there's nothing "improper", "bad practice", "code-smell" or
whatever with using the <code>mem*</code> family of functions for operating on strings,
because strings are just an array of (null-terminated) characters afterall.</p>
<p>One other criticism of this article might be that <code>memccpy(3)</code> and <code>strdup(3)</code>,
while defined in POSIX, is not defined in the ISO C standard <sup><a id="info-src-1" href="#info-ref-1"><img src="https://nrk.neocities.org/assets/info.svg" width="12px"></a></sup>. But this
argument makes no sense because <code>strlcpy(3)</code> is defined in neither, and in
practice is less portable as well.</p>
<hr><div id="info-ref-1"><p><a href="#info-src-1"><img src="https://nrk.neocities.org/assets/info.svg"></a></p><p>Both <code>memccpy</code> and <code>strdup</code> have been accepted into the
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/23">C2x draft</a>.</p>
</div><hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion"><img src="https://nrk.neocities.org/assets/chain.svg"></a></h2>
<p>In the end, I'm unable to find a situation where <code>strlcpy</code> makes sense. In pretty
much all the cases, I'd much rather use <code>memccpy</code>, <code>memcpy</code> or <code>strdup</code> instead.
So needless to say, I'm not a fan of <code>strlcpy</code>.</p>

Retail windows advertise <span>THC</span> in glittery letters and neon glass, and seven-pointed leaves adorn storefronts and roadside sandwich boards. The newest business near my house is the Stay Lit Smoke Shop, where an alien ripping a bong invites you to use the drive-through.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In fact, neither medical nor recreational marijuana is legal in North Carolina. Technically, we’re getting high on hemp.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">This is probably not what Congress had in mind when it passed the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, commonly called the 2018 Farm Bill, which made the production of hemp—cannabis’s traditionally nonpsychoactive cousin—legal for the first time in nearly a century. Lawmakers who backed hemp legalization <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/mitch-mcconnell-rand-paul-team-hemp-le-msna18925">expected</a> the plant to be used for textiles and nonintoxicating supplements, such as CBD oil and shelled hemp seeds (great on an acai bowl). They didn’t realize that, with some chemistry and creativity, hemp can get you just as high as the dankest marijuana plant.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The upshot is that although recreational marijuana use is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/legal-weed-map-states/#:~:text=The%20states%20where%20recreational%20weed,Vermont%2C%20Virginia%2C%20and%20Washington">allowed</a> in only 24 states and Washington, D.C., people anywhere in the U.S. can get intoxicated on hemp-derived THC without breaking federal law. These hemp-based highs are every bit as potent as those derived from the marijuana available in legalization states. I know this because I’ve tried recreational pot in California and Colorado, as well as 11 different hemp-derived intoxicants legally available here in North Carolina. I am not exaggerating when I say that they are indistinguishable in effect. In other words, six years ago, Congress inadvertently legalized weed across the entire United States.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true"><span>To understand how that happened,</span> we need to review some basic botany. Hemp and marijuana are varieties of the same plant species, <em>Cannabis sativa</em>. The chemical compounds unique to <em>Cannabis sativa</em> are called cannabinoids. Scientists have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8803256/">identified</a> about 100 naturally occurring cannabinoids, which fall into two broad categories: those that get you high and those that do not. Marijuana (also referred to, somewhat confusingly, as cannabis) is defined by its high content of delta-9 THC, a cannabinoid that gets you high. Hemp contains very little delta-9 THC but can contain a large amount of cannabidiol, or CBD, a cannabinoid that does <em>not</em> get you high.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Congress effectively banned both plant varieties in 1937 with the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act, which erected an impossible set of regulatory standards for buying and selling any type of <em>Cannabis</em> <em>sativa</em> and imposed stiff criminal penalties for noncompliance. When the Supreme Court overturned that law in 1969, Congress responded with the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, which explicitly outlawed both hemp and marijuana, along with a host of other drugs.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/05/marijuana-rescheduling-research-health/678276/">Read: Marijuana’s health effects are about to get a whole lot clearer</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The push to legalize hemp emerged in the 1980s, thanks mainly to a cannabis enthusiast and head-shop owner named Jack Herer. Herer claimed that the federal government had targeted hemp because its textile applications threatened politically connected magnates, including members of the du Pont family, whose company developed nylon, and William Randolph Hearst, who Herer alleged had been heavily invested in the timber industry, which produced his newspaper stock. Herer, who published a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-emperor-wears-no-clothes-hemp-and-the-marijuana-conspiracy-jack-herer/11599378?ean=9781878125026">book</a> with these allegations in 1985 titled <em>The Emperor Wears No Clothes</em>, insisted that hemp could replace plastic and timber in many applications for less money and without harming the environment.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Herer’s book laid out the basic strategy for hemp advocacy. Instead of arguing for personal freedom, hemp supporters would focus on eco-friendly textiles, the nutritional value of hemp seeds, and, beginning in the early 2010s, CBD oil’s anti-epileptic and anti-anxiety properties.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Herer died in 2010, but the movement he started achieved its victory with the 2018 Farm Bill, which legalized industrial hemp production. Donald Trump’s signature on that bill was like the shot from a starter gun. The previous year, under a small pilot program, American growers had planted <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.votehemp.com/u-s-hemp-crop-report/">25,713 acres</a> of hemp, according to a crop report from the advocacy group Vote Hemp. After the Farm Bill, the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.votehemp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VH_2020_Crop_Report_final.pdf">group reported</a> more than 200,000 acres of hemp planted. Most of that crop was destined to be distilled into CBD. With varying degrees of supporting evidence, producers marketed CBD as an organic supplement for anxiety, sleep, and joint pain. The compound picked up celebrity endorsements and made its way into balms and dog treats.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">CBD was seemingly everywhere—but it wasn’t everywhere enough for the hemp industry, which was after big-brand synergy. The real money would arrive when processed-food conglomerates began adding it to ingredient lists. Hemp entrepreneurs dreamed of Walmart aisles stocked with CBD-infused Red Bull cans.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">It didn’t happen. Big brands and retail chains wouldn’t invest in CBD without FDA approval, and the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-md-signing-agriculture-improvement-act-and-agencys">agency had declared</a>, shortly after the Farm Bill signing, that it couldn’t regulate CBD as a supplement or food additive, because it was being used as the active ingredient in a new drug application. By late 2019, it had become clear that the FDA wouldn’t budge from its position, and hemp prices cratered. That’s the industry’s explanation, anyway. Another possibility is that growers oversaturated the market with a product that consumers eventually realized didn’t have much effect. Either way, the CBD boom had gone bust, and hemp became a buyer’s market for anyone who could find another use for biomass and distilled oils. One possible market was hinted at in the Farm Bill itself.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true"><span>The 2018 Farm Bill</span> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:7%20section:1639o%20edition:prelim)">defines</a> hemp as “the plant <em>Cannabis sativa L.</em> and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.” Translation: As long as your plant, and whatever you make with it, contains less than 0.3 percent delta-9 THC, you can do what you want. Given that marijuana plants typically run closer to 15 percent THC by dry weight, a 0.3 percent cutoff seemed logical on its face—akin to the 0.5 percent alcohol threshold for nonalcoholic beer.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But Congress was not up on its cannabinoid research. In March 2002, the famed Israeli chemist Raphael Mechoulam, who first synthesized and identified THC in the 1960s, had filed a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/43/43/9f/9910319ce43eb8/US7399872.pdf">patent application</a> with two colleagues for converting CBD oil into delta-9 THC—and a lesser-known but similarly intoxicating cannabinoid called delta-8. That breakthrough was purely academic at the time, given that deriving THC from hemp was just as illegal as growing marijuana, only more complicated. However, after the 2018 Farm Bill and the late-2019 collapse of the CBD market, it took on enormous practical implications.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/01/why-cbd-took-over-america/604327/">Read: America loves its unregulated wellness chemicals</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">According to the plain text of the Farm Bill, it appeared to be legal to convert CBD into delta-8 THC so long as the process started with a plant that contained less than 0.3 percent delta-9 THC—an interpretation that was eventually endorsed in a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2022/05/19/21-56133.pdf">ruling</a> by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. It’s unclear who first noticed that loophole, but delta-8 began appearing in news headlines in 2020. Once word got out, the industry response was enthusiastic.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“We got so many calls from farmer after farmer saying, ‘I have so much crop just waiting to be sold,’” Chris Karazin, the founder of Carolindica, a Raleigh-based dispensary, told me. “There was an amazing opportunity for all these extractors. Everyone was just trying to dump stock.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">As a state-approved hemp processor, Carolindica doesn’t synthesize cannabinoids; instead, it turns cannabinoids into products: edibles, tinctures, and even pre-rolled hemp joints, smokable just like old-school marijuana. The company ships to all 50 states and accepts all major credit cards.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The arrival of players like Karazin forced a reckoning in the hemp world. “For 25 years, we wore shirts that said rope not dope,” Jody McGinness, the executive director of the Hemp Industries Association, told me last year. “But out of left field, these products emerged, because the market is a force of nature.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Hemp-based intoxicants aren’t limited to delta-8 THC. The Farm Bill also appears to authorize&nbsp; the creation of hemp-based <em>delta-9</em> THC products as long as the total delta-9 content is 0.3 percent or less of the product’s dry weight. This turns out to be easy to do. Carolindica, for instance, sells a 10-gram gummy that contains 30 milligrams of hemp-derived delta-9 THC, which is exactly 0.3 percent of the gummy’s total weight. The Florida-based company Crispy Blunts sells a cookie that weighs 22 grams and contains 50 milligrams of delta-9 THC. At 0.23 percent by weight, that’s well under the Farm Bill’s threshold, but the total THC content is five to 10 times as high as the legal per-serving limit in many of the states that have legalized recreational-marijuana edibles.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Estimates for the size of the hemp-derived cannabinoid industry are in the billions of dollars. Hemp-derived intoxicants are available at vape shops and gas stations. (The last time I visited my favorite local shop, I was one of two customers. The other was a cop in uniform buying hemp vape pens.) Craft-beer shops in North Carolina sell sodas infused with hemp-derived THC. States in which recreational marijuana is legal have imposed various regulatory limits on its sale.&nbsp; Not so with hemp-derived cannabinoids. According to a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://cbdoracle.com/news/policy/delta-8-thc-legal/">report</a> from <em>CBD Oracle</em>, 17 states nominally banned hemp products as of 2023, but no one can stop deliveries from out-of-state producers, and state-level restrictions are likely preempted by the federal Farm Bill. Judges have blocked such bans from going into effect in Maryland, Arkansas, and Texas.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The seemingly overnight ubiquity of hemp intoxicants is a source of anxiety for the marijuana industry. If two companies are selling essentially the same product, and one is limited to in-person cash sales of highly taxed products at tightly zoned physical locations, while the other can advertise on Instagram, access the financial system, and ship to all 50 states, which company will still be around in five years? “[Marijuana] guys think this isn’t fair,” Karazin told me. “We don’t have to pay 16 percent excise taxes. We can use banks, we can accept credit cards, and we’re federally legal.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The situation has spurred marijuana lobbyists <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thecannabisindustry.org/press-releases/national-cannabis-industry-association-seeks-regulation-of-intoxicating-hemp-products-as-house-agriculture-committee-considers-farm-bill/">to ask</a> for parity in hemp and marijuana regulations, starting with a cap on the strength of hemp-derived intoxicants. The Cannabis Regulators Association has also <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f7e577e23ad7c718c269776/t/64c1c678de0c6e1bc27c5654/1690420857314/CANNRA+Written+Testimony_07-2023_Final.pdf">asked Congress</a> to establish that states can choose to restrict hemp within their borders.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Beyond the self-interested concerns of the marijuana industry, some experts warn that the chemical process of creating hemp-based cannabinoids could be dangerous—as could the new cannabinoids themselves. Humans have been smoking high doses of delta-9 THC for a long time. Not so with delta-8, to say nothing of the even more exotic hemp derivatives being developed.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">These issues have brought together some truly strange bedfellows. In March, a group of 21 state attorneys general, including the progressive Rob Bonta of California and the Trumpist Kris Kobach of Kansas, wrote a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ag.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Corrected-Ltr-Concerning-Five-Year-Farm-Bill-Reauthorization.pdf">joint letter</a> demanding that Congress amend the definition of <em>hemp</em> to&nbsp; “clarify that there is no federal hemp intoxicants loophole.” Accordingly, in May, the House Agriculture Committee adopted an amendment for the next Farm Bill banning hemp-based cannabinoids. Whether that makes it into the final bill is an open question. The amendment drew the ire of not just the hemp industry but also the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America, which has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/prohibition-never-works-wswa-responds-to-proposed-farm-bill-amendment-302158214.html">joined</a> the marijuana industry in calling for the regulation, but not prohibition, of hemp-derived intoxicants.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-2" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 3" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="3"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/04/marijuana-psychedelics-legalization-medical/677983/">Read: Almost no one is happy with legal weed</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Perhaps the best evidence of how the fight will play out comes from legislative battles at the state level. In early June, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/desantis-launches-florida-freedom-fund-to-oppose-marijuana-legalization-ballot-initiative-as-campaign-reports-millions-in-new-donations/">launched a political-action committee</a> to fight a state ballot initiative that would legalize recreational marijuana. The very same week, he vetoed a bill that would have restricted hemp cannabinoids in the state.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Industries this large can be corralled by regulation, but they’re tough to destroy. By the time Florida’s anti-delta-8 bill came across DeSantis’s desk, he had probably noticed the billboards begging him not to eliminate 100,000 jobs in the state. The high-on-hemp business, in other words, may already be too big to ban.</p></section><section data-event-module="footer"><p>Support for this project was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.</p></section><gpt-ad format="injector" sizes-at-0="mobile-wide,native,house" targeting-pos="injector-most-popular" sizes-at-976="desktop-wide,native,house"></gpt-ad></article></div>]]></description>

At the
2024 <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>, Wedson Almeida Filho and
Kent Overstreet led a combined storage and filesystem session on using Rust
for Linux filesystems. Back in December 2023, Almeida had <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-fsdevel/20231018122518.128049-1-wedsonaf@gmail.com/">posted
an RFC patch set</a> with
some Rust abstractions for filesystems, which resulted in <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/958072/">some disagreement over the approach</a>.  On the
same mid-May day as the session, he <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240514131711.379322-1-wedsonaf@gmail.com/">posted</a>
a second version of the RFC patches, which he wanted to discuss along with
other Rust-related topics.
</p>

<h4>Goals</h4>

<p>
After updating attendees on the status of his patches, Almeida listed some
of the goals of the <a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/">Rust-for-Linux
project</a>, which are embodied in the filesystem abstractions that he is proposing.  The first is to express more of the requirements using Rust's
type system in order to catch more mistakes at compile time.  In addition,
the project's developers want to automate some tasks, such as cleaning up
resources, in ways that are not easily
available to C code. The overall idea is to have a more productive
filesystem-development experience, with less time spent on debugging
problems that the compiler could find, and with fewer memory-related
vulnerabilities overall.
</p>

</a></p><p>
Overstreet said that he had been a part of too many two-week bug hunts and
has been trying to find ways to avoid those kinds of problems for bcachefs.
The Rust language provides a lot more than what he can do in C; it
eliminates undefined behavior and provides facilities to see what is happening
inside the code. "You can't debug, if you can't see what's going on."  He
believes that kernel development "will get a whole lot easier over the
coming decades" due to using Rust.  It will be possible to prove the
correctness of code written in Rust, which will mean that bugs that can derail
feature development will be much less common.
</p>

<p>
From his <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dflxtAojRu3mdx19oBHP3vXCXI1vocFIVc5jVaf9FLA/">slides</a>,
Almeida showed an example of how the Rust type system can eliminate certain
kinds of errors.  He noted that the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.5/source/fs/inode.c#L1248"><tt>iget_locked()</tt></a>
function in current kernels has a complicated set of requirements.  Callers
must check to see if the return value is null and, if it is not, then the
contents of the returned <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.5/source/include/linux/fs.h#L632"><tt>struct&nbsp;inode</tt></a>
need to be checked to see if it is a new or existing inode. If it is new,
it needs to be initialized before it can be used; if that fails, <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.5/source/fs/bad_inode.c#L244"><tt>iget_failed()</tt></a>
needs to be called, he said.
</p>

<p>
There was some discussion of the finer points of what callers of
<tt>iget_locked()</tt> need to do, with Al Viro disagreeing with some of
what Almeida had on his slide.  That went back and forth, with Overstreet
observing that it was exactly that kind of discussion/argument that could
be avoided by encapsulating the rules into the Rust types and abstractions;
the compiler will know the right thing to do.
</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>
Overstreet noted that Christian
Brauner and Alice Ryhl have helped to improve the abstractions a great deal
since the first posting; in particular, there are things he has learned
about reference counts based on how they are being handled by the Rust
code. "This is going to make all our lives so much easier", Overstreet said.
</p>

<p>
Almeida put up a slide with the equivalent of <tt>iget_locked()</tt> in
Rust, which was called <tt>get_or_create_inode()</tt>.  The important part
is the return type, he said; as with C, callers must check for failure, but
the success case is much different.  If it is successful, the caller either
receives a regular reference-counted inode to use (which has its reference
count automatically decremented when the inode object is no longer
referenced) or it receives  
a new inode, which will 
automatically call the equivalent of <tt>iget_failed()</tt> if it is never initialized.  If
it is ever initialized (which can only be done once), it becomes a regular
inode with the automatic 
reference-count decrement.  All of that is enforced through the type system.
</p>

<p>
Viro seemed somewhat skeptical of how that would work in practice.  He wondered
where in the source code those constraints would be defined.  Almeida said
that the whole idea is to determine what the constraints are from Viro and
other filesystem developers, then to create types and abstractions that can
enforce them.
</p>

<h4>Disconnect</h4>

<p>
Dave Chinner asked about the disconnect between the names in the C API and
the Rust API, which means that developers cannot look at the C code and
know what the equivalent Rust call would be.  He said that the same names
should be used or it would all be completely unfamiliar to the existing
development community.  In addition, when the C code changes, the Rust code
needs to follow along, but who is going to do that work?  Almeida agreed
that it was something that needs to be discussed.
</p>

<p>
As far as the renamed functions goes, he is not opposed to switching the
names to match the C API, but does not think <tt>iget_locked()</tt> is a
particularly good name.  It might make sense to take the opportunity to
create better names. 
</p>

<p>
There was some more discussion of the example, with Viro saying that it was
not a good choice because <tt>iget_locked()</tt> is a library function,
rather than a member function of the superblock object.  Almeida said that
there was no reason <tt>get_or_create_inode()</tt> could not be turned into
a library function; his example was simply meant to show how the
constraints could be encoded in the types.
</p>

<p>
Brauner said that there needs to be a decision on whether the Rust
abstractions are going to be general-purpose, intended for all kernel
filesystems,  or if they will only be focused on the
functionality needed for the simpler filesystems that have been written in Rust.  There is also a longer-term problem in handling
situations where functions like <tt>get_or_create_inode()</tt> encode a lot
more of the constraints than <tt>iget_locked()</tt> does.  As the C code
evolves, which will happen more quickly than with the Rust code, at least
initially, there will be a need to keep the two APIs in sync.
</p>

<p>
It comes down to a question of whether refactoring and cleanup will be done
as part of adding the Rust abstractions, Overstreet said; he strongly
believes that is required. But there is more to it than just that, James
Bottomley said.  The object lifecycles are being encoded into the Rust API,
but there is no equivalent of that in C; if someone changes the lifecycle
of the object on one side, the other will have bugs.
</p>

<p>
There are also problems because the lifecycle of inode objects is
sometimes filesystem-specific, Chinner said. Encoding a single lifecycle understanding
into the API means that its functions will not work for some filesystems.
Overstreet said that filesystems which are not using the VFS API would
simply not benefit, but Chinner said that a VFS inode is just a structure
and it is up to filesystems to manage its lifetime.
Almeida said that the example would only be used by filesystems that
currently call <tt>iget_locked()</tt> and could benefit.  The Rust
developers are not trying to force filesystems to change how they are doing
things. 
</p>

<h4>Allocating pain</h4>

<p>
Part of the problem, Ted Ts'o said, is that there is an effort to get
"everyone to switch over to the religion" of Rust; that will not happen, he
said, because there are 50+ different filesystems in Linux that will not be
instantaneously converted.  The C code will continue to be improved and if
that breaks the Rust bindings, it will break the filesystems that depend on
them. For the foreseeable future, the Rust bindings are a second-class
citizen, he said; broken Rust bindings are a problem for the
Rust-for-Linux developers and not the filesystem community at large.
</p>

<p>
He suggested that the development of the Rust bindings continue, while the
C code continues to evolve.  As those changes occur, "we will find out
whether or not
this concept of encoding huge amounts of semantics into the type system is
a good thing or a bad thing".  In a year or two, he thinks the answer to that will become
clear; really, though, it will come down to a question of "where does the
pain get allocated".  In his mind, large-scale changes like this almost always come down to a
"pain-allocation question". 
</p>

<p>
Almeida said that he is not trying to keep the C API static; his goal is
to get the filesystem developers to explain the semantics of the API so
that they can be encoded into Rust.  Bottomley said that as more of those
semantics get encoded into the bindings, they will become more fragile from
a synchronization standpoint.
Several disagreed with that, in the form of a jumble of "no" replies and
the like. Almeida said that it was the same with any user of an API; if the
API changes, the users need to be updated.  But Ts'o pointedly said that
not everyone will learn Rust; if he makes a change, he will fix all of the
affected C code, but, "because I don't know Rust, I am not going to fix the Rust
bindings, sorry".
</p>

<p>
Viro came back to his objections about the proposed replacement for
<tt>iget_locked()</tt>.  The underlying problem that he sees is the
reliance on methods versus functions; using methods is not the proper way
forward because the arguments are not specified explicitly.  But Overstreet
said that the complaints about methods come from 
languages like C++ that rely too heavily on inheritance, which is "a crap
idea".  Rust does not do so; methods in Rust are largely just a syntactical
element. 
</p>

<p>
There was some discussion of what exactly is being encoded in the types.
Jan Kara said that there is some behavior that goes with the inode, such as
its reference count and its handling, but there is other behavior that is
inherent in the 
<tt>iget_locked()</tt> function.  Overstreet and Almeida said that those
two pieces were both encoded into the types, but separately; other
functions using the inode type could have return values with different
properties. 
</p>

<p>
Viro went through some of his reasoning about why inodes work the way they
do in the VFS.  He agreed with the idea of starting small to see where
things lead.  Overstreet suggested that maybe the example used was not a
good starting point, "because this is the complicated case". "Oh, no it
isn't", Viro replied to laughter as the session concluded.

While Bankster goes on to discuss reasons why this may be glitched for users like him in particular, the utter lack of control being given over his sensitive, private information is unacceptable for a company of Google's stature —and does not bode well for future privacy concerns amongst AI's often-forced rollout.</p><div><blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just pulled up my tax return in @Google Docs--and unbidden, Gemini summarized it.

Contrary to the initial posting, this is technically happening within the larger umbrella of Google Drive and not Google Docs specifically, though it seems likely the issue could apply to Docs as well.</p><p>But what caused this issue? According to Google's Gemini AI, the privacy settings used to inform Gemini should be openly available, but they aren't, which means the AI is either "hallucinating (lying)" or some internal systems on Google's servers are outright malfunctioning. Either way, not a great look, even if this private data supposedly isn't used to train the Gemini AI.</p><p>What's more, Bankston did eventually find the settings toggle in question... only to find that Gemini summaries in Gmail, Drive, and Docs were already disabled. Additionally, it was in an entirely different place than either of the web pages to which Gemini's bot initially pointed.</p><p>For Bankston, the issue seems localized to Google Drive, and only happens after pressing the Gemini button on at least one document. The matching document type (in this case, PDF) will subsequently automatically trigger Google Gemini for all future files of the same type opened within Google Drive. He additionally theorizes that it may have been caused by him enabling Google Workspace Labs back in 2023, which could be overriding the intended Gemini AI settings.</p><p>Even if this issue is isolated to Google Workspace Labs users, it's quite a severe downside for having helped Google test its latest and greatest tech. User consent still matters on a granular basis, particularly with potentially sensitive information, and Google has utterly failed at least one segment of its user base by failing to stay true to that principle.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-wRuffs8ZMbx8jqi7TCGfnZ"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div>

        <section property="schema:text"> <p>Could this be the world’s most interesting bird? Sure, it doesn’t <em>look</em> that interesting. In fact, at a glance, it seems like a run-of-the-mill sparrow.</p>

<p>It doesn’t live in far-off&nbsp;exotic places, either: It may be outside your window right now. The White-throated Sparrow is common and familiar, hopping on the ground under bird feeders all over the eastern states in winter. It appears by the hundreds during migration in places like New York City’s Central Park and Chicago’s lakefront parks. But this seemingly ordinary backyard bird has a secret identity—or, actually, four secret identities. And it's these multiple personalites that place&nbsp;the White-throat at the center of mysteries&nbsp;scientists are still working out.</p>

<p>Watch a flock of White-throats in spring and you’ll notice they have two kinds of head patterns. Some wear snappy stripes of black and white across the top of the head. Others have more modest head stripes of dark brown and tan. That superficial difference might not seem like a big deal, but it reflects a remarkable divergence in the lifestyles of these individuals.</p>

<p>For years it was assumed that tan stripes indicated a young White-throat. As late as 1947, in his classic <em>Field Guide to the Birds</em>, Roger Peterson described the adult’s “striped black and white crown” and said the immature was “duller, but with the same essential recognition-marks.” By that time, there’d been hints already that the colors might not be just a function of age. For example, in <em>The Birds of Massachusetts</em> in 1929, ornithologist Edward Howe Forbush mentioned a two-year-old banded White-throat that “had not attained full adult plumage.” He added that “Some require an extra year, or possibly even more, to assume highest plumage.” But he didn’t go so far as to suggest that some adults would never develop those white stripes.</p>

<p>Finally, in 1961, a landmark study by Canadian ornithologist James Lowther revealed the true nature of the color differences. A White-throated Sparrow, he demonstrated, would be white-striped or tan-striped for life—these were permanent color morphs, and about half of all males and half of all females fell into each color type.</p>


<span data-lazyblock-hash="bean::5478::1672138908">
</span><p>It’s not rare for a bird species to have color morphs. Check your field guide: There are morphs in Eastern Screech-Owls, Reddish Egrets, Red-tailed Hawks, and others. But White-throated Sparrows are different. As Lowther discovered, mated pairs of White-throats almost always involved one bird of each color morph: Either a tan-striped male with a white-striped female, or a white-striped male with a tan-striped female. Intrigued, Lowther extended his research, joined by biologist J. Bruce Falls and others. As studies continued, it became obvious that these two color morphs, existing side by side throughout the species’ range, are stunningly different from each other in behavior.</p>

<p>Within each gender, white-striped birds are more aggressive while tan-striped birds are more nurturing. That seemingly simple generalization is based on a vast amount of research. For many years, Falls and his students at the University of Toronto carried out highly detailed studies of White-throated Sparrows, showing how behavioral differences between the morphs touched every aspect of these birds’ lives.</p>

<p>Consider their defense of breeding territories. White-throated Sparrows nest in coniferous and mixed forests of Canada and the northeastern states, but within this habitat, white-striped males tend to be in slightly more open areas, while tan-striped males are often in denser forest. As with most songbirds, they defend their territories mainly by singing. White-striped males sing far more often than tan-striped males. White-striped females also sing fairly often, but tan-striped females rarely do. They all sing variations of the whistled <em>Oh, sweet, Kimberly-Kimberly-Kimberly!,</em> but the songs of tan-striped birds average slightly lower-pitched, and these lower sounds may carry better through dense habitat.</p>

<p>Now, when singing isn’t enough, White-throats will actively chase away intruders on their territory. White-striped males, though,&nbsp;are much more aggressive than tan-striped males in these chases. White-striped females will also take part in chasing, but tan-striped females don’t seem to do much to defend the territory.</p>

<p>In the actual process of raising young, tan-striped birds shine. Only females (of either morph) build the nest and incubate the eggs, but after the eggs hatch, both parents bring food for the young. On average, females bring more food than males. But within each sex, tan-striped birds bring more food than white-striped ones.</p>

<p>So are females most strongly attracted to the tough, macho, white-striped males? Actually, no. Lab studies have found that females of either morph prefer the tan-striped males. White-striped females, more pushy than their tan-striped sisters, grab the tan-striped bachelors right away, so these pairs form more quickly than the opposite combination. Males of both morphs tend to prefer the white-striped females, but those females quickly hook up with tan-striped males if they can, so eventually the leftover birds will form pairs consisting of white-striped males and tan-striped females. Once they’re paired up, tan-striped birds of either sex tend to be faithfully monogamous, but white-striped birds are sometimes promiscuous.</p>

<p>Talk about a complicated dating scene! Nesting pairs consist of one bird from each morph more than 95 percent of the time, but it’s especially interesting to consider what happens on those occasions when two birds of the <em>same</em> morph pair up. In short, it’s likely to be a bad idea. Pairs consisting of two white-striped birds may fail to raise any young because they spend too much time fighting with each other and not enough time feeding the kids. Pairs consisting of two tan-striped birds might fail completely at defending their territory, but that’s a guess; we don’t have much data.</p>

</span><p>So the morphs differ in traits that parallel the usual differences between the sexes in birds. Looking at White-throats in the breeding season, we see four distinct types. To oversimplify, we could call them super-aggressive males, more nurturing males, somewhat aggressive females, and super-nurturing females. It’s almost as if the White-throated Sparrow has four sexes. That may sound like a joke, but it’s actually a good description of what’s going on.</p>

<p>We’ve known since the late 1960s that the two color morphs differ in their chromosomes. Tan-striped birds have two identical copies of chromosome 2, but in white-striped birds, one copy of chromosome 2 has a large section inverted, as if it had been put in backwards. Recent work by biologist Elaina Tuttle and others has established that this section of the chromosome is not just inverted, but scrambled in a variety of ways. And it doesn’t just control the color of head stripes. Many different genes here are tightly linked to form a “supergene,” so that birds of one color morph also inherit a whole range of behaviors. The resulting effect is that the White-throat <a href="http://www.molecularecologist.com/2016/02/supergenes-and-sparrows-with-four-sexes/">really does operate as a bird with four sexes</a>. For anyone curious about the scientific background, you can <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(15)01562-6">read all the technical details here</a>.</p>

<p>As far as we know, there’s no other bird in the world with this unique arrangement. And the lab work to discover the genetic details was done only because we already knew something weird was going on—because people had taken time to watch the behavior of White-throated Sparrows in the wild. Who knows what other mysteries might be just waiting to be revealed? Most of us will never discover anything quite so astonishing as this, but we can all keep in mind that even the most common bird may have its own rare secrets.</p>
