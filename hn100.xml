            <p>
    Posted on  8 September 2019
    
</p>


<p><em>Translated to <a href="https://pngset.com/ru-weird-cpu-instruction">Russian</a> by <a href="https://pngset.com/">Babur
Muradov</a> and <a href="https://pngflare.com/uz-popcount">Uzbek</a> by
<a href="https://pngflare.com/">Leonid Popov</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>This is a pseudo-transcript of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLFqLfz2Fmc">a presentation I did at !!Con
2019</a>.</em></p>
<p>Most CPU architectures in use today have an instruction called <code>popcount</code>,
short for “population count”. Here’s what it does: it counts the number of set
bits in a machine word. For example (assuming 8-bit words for simplicity),
<code>popcount(00100110)</code> is <code>3</code> and <code>popcount(01100000)</code> is <code>2</code>.</p>
<p>You might be wondering, like I was, if there’s more to this instruction, but
that’s all it does! This doesn’t seem very useful, right?</p>
<p>I thought this might be a recent addition for some hyperspecialised use case,
but it has in fact been present in CPU architectures since at least 1961:</p>
<ul>
<li>1961: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_7030_Stretch">IBM Stretch</a></li>
<li>1964: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC_6000_series">CDC 6000</a></li>
<li>1975: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray-1">Cray-1</a></li>
<li>2005: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC">SPARC</a></li>
<li>2005: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture#Advanced_SIMD_(NEON)">ARM NEON</a></li>
<li>2007: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_10h">AMD K10</a></li>
<li>2008: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehalem_(microarchitecture)">Intel Nehalem</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So what’s going on?</p>
<h4 id="the-nsa-instruction">The NSA Instruction</h4>
<p><code>popcount</code> is also known as “The NSA Instruction”, and a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.arch/UXEi7G6WHuU/Z2z7fC7Xhr8J">very entertaining
thread on
<code>comp.arch</code></a>
discusses its uses inside and outside cryptography. It is rumoured that it was
originally added to CPU instructions at the behest of the NSA. As <a href="http://cryptome.org/jya/sadd.htm">this
archived email thread</a> puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was almost a tradition that one of the first of any new faster CDC machine
was delivered to a “good customer” - picked up at the factory by an anonymous
truck, and never heard from again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes for a great story, but what were they using it for?</p>
<p>One measure of information content is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight">Hamming
weight</a>, which is the number of
symbols in a string that are different from the zero-symbol of the alphabet.
For a binary string, this is exactly <code>popcount</code>!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?t=38521">As explained here</a>, the
NSA wanted to do cryptanalysis on intercepted messages, and since the CDC 6000
had 60-bit words, one word was enough to store most alphabets they were
interested in. They were able to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Split a message into lines</li>
<li>Set a bit for each unique character they encountered per line</li>
<li>Use <code>popcount</code> to count the distinct characters</li>
<li>Use the count as a hash for further cryptanalysis</li>
</ol>
<p>Curiously, <code>popcount</code> seems to have disappeared from instruction sets between
the mid-1970s and the mid-2000s, so there has to be more to it than
cryptographic applications to explain its return. What else can it be used for?</p>
<h4 id="error-correction">Error Correction</h4>
<p>Related to the concept of Hamming weight is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">Hamming
distance</a>, which is the number
of differing positions between two strings of identical length. For two binary
strings <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, this is just the <code>popcount</code> of them XORed together. For
example:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1">00100110</span>
<span id="cb1-2">01100000 ^</span>
<span id="cb1-3">--------</span>
<span id="cb1-4">01000110</span>
<span id="cb1-5"></span>
<span id="cb1-6">popcount(01000110) = 3</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For telecommunications applications, this helps us calculate the signal
distance, where a known word is sent over the wire and the number of flipped
bits are counted to provide an estimate of the error introduced by transmission.</p>
<p>We can then design an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance#Error_detection_and_error_correction">error-correcting
code</a>
accordingly, e.g.&nbsp;if we want to be robust against up to 2 flipped bits, our
code words need to differ in Hamming distance by at least 5.</p>
<h4 id="binary-convolutional-neural-networks">Binary Convolutional Neural Networks</h4>
<p>And now for something completely different: binary convolutional neural
networks! But first, what are they?</p>
<ul>
<li>Binary means that we’re using matrices consisting of only the values +1 (coded
as <code>1</code>) and -1 (coded as <code>0</code>), as opposed to 32-bit floating-point values.</li>
<li>Convolutional means matrix multiplication is involved?</li>
<li>Neural networks are systems inspired by animal brains (I’m a bit hazy on
this part).</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, we have to do binary matrix multiplication. But what’s special
about binary matrices?</p>
<p>Ordinary matrix multiplication on 32-bit values is a good fit on desktop
computers with powerful CPUs and GPUs, but increasingly we also want to do
useful work on smaller and simpler devices, such as smartphones, routers,
smartwatches, etc. We can decompose these more complex matrices into layers of
binary matrices, and these resulting matrices are so much easier to store and
operate on that we are better off even though there are more layers.</p>
<p>Where does <code>popcount</code> come into play? It’s used to calculate the dot product of
two binary matrices:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1">a = xnor(x, y)</span>
<span id="cb2-2">b = popcount(a)</span>
<span id="cb2-3">c = len(a)</span>
<span id="cb2-4">dot(x, y) = 2 × b − c</span></code></pre></div>
<p>More details are available
<a href="https://sushscience.wordpress.com/2017/10/01/understanding-binary-neural-networks/">here</a>
and
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders/mpscnnbinaryconvolution">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="chess-programming">Chess Programming</h4>
<p>Many chess programs store data using a
<a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards">bitboard</a> representation, which
conveniently fits into a 64-bit word. <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Population_Count">Population
Count</a> has been used to
perform meaningful operations with this representation, such as calculating the
<a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Mobility#Mobility_with_Bitboards">mobility</a>
of a piece.</p>
<h4 id="molecular-fingerprinting">Molecular Fingerprinting</h4>
<p>This is related to the notion of Hamming distance above: molecules are hashed
in some way and compared (with <code>popcount</code>) to determine how similar they are.
More details on that
<a href="http://www.dalkescientific.com/writings/diary/archive/2008/06/26/fingerprint_background.html">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="hash-array-mapped-tries">Hash Array Mapped Tries</h4>
<p>This is where I first learned about <code>popcount</code>! The HAMT is a data structure
(<a href="https://lampwww.epfl.ch/papers/idealhashtrees.pdf">pioneered by Phil
Bagwell</a>) that can store a
very large number of values (usually 32 or 64) in an array at each node of the
trie. However, allocating memory for a 32 or 64-element array every time can be
incredibly wasteful, especially if the array only actually contains a handful
of elements. The solution is to add a bitmask in which the number of bits that
are set corresponds to the number of elements in the array, which allows the
array to grow and shrink as required. Calculating the index for a given element
efficiently can then be done using <code>popcount</code>. You can learn more about how
they work from <a href="https://vaibhavsagar.com/blog/2018/07/29/hamts-from-scratch/">this blog post</a>, where I
implement them myself.</p>
<h4 id="succinct-data-structures">Succinct Data Structures</h4>
<p>This is an exciting new area of research that focuses on how to store data in
as little space as possible, without having to decompress it in order to do
useful work. One technique is to think in terms of arrays of bits (bitvectors), which can be
queried using two operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rank(i)</code> counts the number of bits set upto the <code>i</code>th index in the bitvector</li>
<li><code>select(i)</code> finds the index where the <code>i</code>th ranked bit is set</li>
</ul>
<p>Making these operations efficient on large bitvectors requires constructing an
index and using it effectively, both involving <code>popcount</code>. There’s <a href="https://alexbowe.com/rrr/">a good
overview of the RRR index here</a>, and as far as I can
tell the current state-of-the-art approach is described in <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./dga/papers/zhou-sea2013.pdf">Space-Efficient,
High-Performance Rank &amp; Select Structures on Uncompressed Bit
Sequences</a>.</p>
<h4 id="compiler-optimisations">Compiler Optimisations</h4>
<p><code>popcount</code> has become so pervasive that both
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/JUzmD8">GCC</a> and <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/AVqMGl">Clang</a>
will detect an implementation of <code>popcount</code> and replace it with the built-in
instruction. Imagine Clippy going “I see you are trying to implement
<code>popcount</code>, let me go ahead and fix that for you”! The relevant LLVM code is
<a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/f36485f7ac2a8d72ad0e0f2134c17fd365272285/lib/Transforms/Scalar/LoopIdiomRecognize.cpp#L960">here</a>.
Daniel Lemire points to this as an example of <a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2016/05/23/the-surprising-cleverness-of-modern-compilers/">the surprising cleverness of
modern
compilers</a>.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>From beginnings shrouded in mystery, <code>popcount</code> has emerged as a generally
useful, if slightly unusual, CPU instruction. I love how it ties together such
different fields of computing, and I wonder how many other similarly weird
instructions are out there. If you have a favourite, I’d love to hear about it!</p>

<p>
The following is based upon systems of equations found in "Symmetry in Chaos,
A Search for Pattern in Mathematics, Art, and Nature" (the second edition) by
Michael Field and Martin Golubitsky.
They ask the question whether there are aperiodic chaotic attractors that generate
symmetric patterns?
Can there be order within chaotic systems?
</p>

The attractors are based upon the following
formula for the m+1'th term in the series given 5 parameters a<sub>0</sub>
 a<sub>1</sub> ... a<sub>4</sub>. The integer n is the degree of symmetry.
The z is complex valued and all a<sub>n</sub> are real valued.
</p>

<center>
   <img src="http://paulbourke.net/fractals/symmetryinchaos/equation1.png" width="472" height="40">
</center><p>
Many of the examples presented here are named as published in the book and by other experimenters. The parameters a<sub>0</sub> 
 a<sub>1</sub> ... a<sub>4</sub> for some are provided in the book and subsequent papers, 
where they are denoted as lambda, alpha, beta, omega and gamma respectively.

The images here are generated by iterating the series typically 1,000 million times. This is performed in two passes,
the first pass with many fewer iterations is used to find the bounds of the attractor on the complex plane, the second
pass actually "draws" the attractor points. The process of drawing involves treating the bounded region of the complex
plane as a 2D histogram, each time the series passes through a pixel region on the plane the histogram at that
location is incremented. One might imagine the 2D histogram as a height field, a larger values at a point indicate
that the complex series passed through that pixel more often than a point with a smaller value.
At the end of the process the histogram is mapped onto colours depending on the histogram values, there are many
ways to do this based on aesthetic grounds.

A rough guide to parameters.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The value of n determines the rotational symmetry of the image, it should be greater than or equal to 2.
</li><li>a<sub>0</sub> is usually between -3 and 3, values between -1 and 1 are generally less interesting.
</li><li>a<sub>1</sub> should have the opposite sign as a<sub>0</sub>, and be in the same range.
</li><li>a<sub>2</sub> perturbs the attractor, it can be 0.
</li><li>a<sub>3</sub> controls bilateral symmetry, 0 will result in mirror symmetry. Otherwise typical values
are between -1 and 1.
</li><li>a<sub>4</sub> typically between -1 and 1 and not too close to zero.
</li></ul><center>

Unfortunately, for a system of equations with 6 parameters and therefore a large parameter space, the set of
parameters that yield "interesting" results is quite small.

Salesforce promoted that its CDP can process large amounts of customer data in "real-time," meaning in "milliseconds," the lawsuit says.</p><p>One benefit to real-time data processing that Salesforce advertises, for example, is when a hospital may need the most up-to-date information on a patient regarding urgent healthcare needs.</p><p>"When milliseconds matter most, your healthcare provider can deliver proactive guidance and care recommendations with access to your real-time patient data," <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.salesforce.com/ap/blog/2022/09/what-is-salesforce-genie.html#genie-business-impact" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">the company wrote</a>.</p><p>Salesforce unveiled its CDP software, Genie, to the public on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/salesforce-dreamforce-acquisitions-growth-margins-revenue-target-2022-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">September 20, 2022</a>. In a keynote slide attached to the court documents, the company repeats the term "real-time" four times.</p><p>According to the court documents, Salesforce said it was the "biggest announcement" it had made since the founders started the company.</p><p>But "it was all a lie," the lawsuit says.</p><p>The court documents say the software does not operate as fast as the term "real-time" suggests, and "in fact many of its processes took several hours."</p><p>"While it was able to execute some functions such as information collection in real time, other operations such as the processing and organizing of that data took hours to complete," the lawsuit says.</p><p>On <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.salesforce.com/ap/blog/2022/09/what-is-salesforce-genie.html" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">Salesforce's website about Genie</a>, the company says the software "collects and unifies data in milliseconds."</p><p>For example, "a personalized offer on a website you're browsing changes instantly because of something you just clicked in a marketing email," the company writes. "Because the company uses Marketing Cloud Genie, that offer changes immediately into something that is more relevant to you than the one you'd otherwise be looking at. This convinces you to go ahead and make a purchase."</p><p>Wirth recommended that Salesforce pursue this software capability in late 2021 or early 2022, according to court documents, but it became clear to the Customer Data Platform (CDP) team that it could not "develop the technology in time" for Salesforce's announcement in September 2022.</p><p>The lawsuit also claimed that the CDP team "wanted to redefine the meaning of 'real-time,' so that it could falsely claim that the CDP operated in real-time."</p><p>"Plaintiff reasonably believed that publicly claiming the CDP operated in 'real-time' without actually having (or even intending to have in the near future) such a capability would be fraudulent, and likely violate numerous provisions of Federal law relating to fraud against shareholders, as well as rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission," the lawsuit stated.</p><p>Wirth then decided to act as a whistleblower and brought up his concerns to the CDP team and other "key executives," the lawsuit said.</p><p>In addition, he approached his direct supervisor, Lidiane Jones, now <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-lidiane-jones-the-new-slack-ceo-succeeding-stewart-butterfield-2022-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">CEO of Slack Technologies</a>, about his concerns. The lawsuit says Jones then began a "deceitful campaign to diminish" Wirth's reputation at the company.</p><p>One of Wirth's last "whistleblowing activities" was a one-on-one meeting with Saleseforce's CTO, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/parker-harris-salesforce-cofounder-profile-2015-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">Parker Harris</a>, during which he brought up his concerns about the CDP team and Jones's "use of false criticisms."</p><p>Wirth was fired hours later, the lawsuit says.</p><p>Harris and spokespersons for Slack and Salesforce did not respond to a request for comment sent during the weekend.</p><p>Wirth is seeking monetary damages due to what the lawsuit calls Salesforces' "whistleblower retaliation."</p><p>His attorney did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

      <p><span><strong>Today in Tedium:</strong> In the past, I’ve been effusive of my praise of CNET, a news outlet that (along with <em>Wired</em>) pioneered digital journalism, for one specific reason: Its archives have been kept safe from meddling. It is one of the most in-depth archives of news that we have from the early years of the internet, and it is arguably of the most important flavor—day-to-day, standard issue news content. But its ownership picture has changed in recent years, with the media holding company Red Ventures purchasing it (and its subsidiaries, most notably ZDNet, which hasn’t been attached to Ziff Davis for <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/cnet-networks-completes-zdnet-acquisition/">more than 20 years</a>) for $500 million back in 2020. Red Ventures has made some controversial moves with the CNET property, <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/cnet-publishing-articles-by-ai">most infamously bringing AI into the mix</a>, but the latest move was like a dagger to the heart: <em>Gizmodo</em> revealed that the company was actively culling its utterly massive archives for search-engine optimization reasons. I’ve talked about killing sites before, but in today’s Tedium, let’s talk culling, and why it’s often just as bad. <em>— Ernie @ Tedium</em></span></p>

<p><h3>“Content pruning removes, redirects, or refreshes URLs that are no longer relevant or helpful to our audience, including outdated or redundant content that may confuse or frustrate users looking for up-to-date information. (For example, a 1996 article about available AOL service tiers is no longer relevant or useful.) Also called content deprecation, it sends a signal to Google that says CNET is fresh, relevant and worthy of being placed higher than our competitors in search results.”</h3>
</p>
<p><strong>— A description of “content pruning,”</strong> the process CNET’s archive is undergoing, in an <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23903730-faq-on-cnet-content-pruning-aug-2023">internal memo</a> acquired by <em>Gizmodo</em> reporter Thomas Germain ahead of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/cnet-deletes-thousands-old-articles-google-search-seo-1850721475">the scoop he wrote about CNET</a> earlier this week. Despite CNET’s claims, Google Search Liaison Danny Sullivan directly refuted CNET’s claims that this was an effective strategy <a href="https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/1689018769782476800">in a tweet he posted</a> just ahead of Germain’s story.</p>

<p><em>This is not a news website. (<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/PAEwrnasOvY">Devin H/Unsplash</a>)</em></p>
<h3>A news website is not a bonsai tree. Often, it’s a library and an archive. You shouldn’t prune a news archive.</h3>
<p>A few years ago, I wrote a piece that described the domain name system (DNS) <a href="https://tedium.co/2020/05/08/top-level-domain-history/">as a system of branches</a> built from a series of top-level domains. I think that comparison largely stands, but I do think that when you get to the website level, the comparison falls apart to some degree.</p>
<p>Oh sure, there are folders and directories, and those branch off in many ways akin to the world’s most complex flow chart, but in some ways, the information architecture starts to matter a little less. If you look at the tree of the domain system as branches when you finally get to the leaves, you are going to look at those leaves as disposable.</p>
<p>The problem is, those leaves are often not disposable. Much the opposite. They do not fall off the tree every fall after growing through the spring and summer. They in many cases, just stay there, maybe less visible than they once were, but still central to what the site represents. If they fall off, the tree is not doing its job. It’s the point where the tree metaphor to describe the internet totally breaks, if you get my drift.</p>
<p>If we did look at websites as trees with branches full of meaningless tiny leaves, it would be all too easy to see every website as a bonsai tree in waiting.</p>
<p>Yes, bonsai, the Asian art of growing miniature trees and pruning them perfectly, perhaps makes sense to some degree as a metaphor for websites that can be redesigned and restructured as necessary. But when it comes to the information architecture, the metaphor rings hollow over time, because it does not show proper deference to the information.</p>
<p>Now, it’s true that not every website is going to have long-term value. The term ephemera comes to mind, and sometimes, ephemeral things should be allowed to fade away with the passage of time. (<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/59p89z/why-is-the-internet-archive-painstakingly-preserving-one-mans-junk-mail">Unless you’re Ted Nelson</a> and you keep those things.) Maybe you decide that your marketing blog shouldn’t live forever, that you would prefer to class up the joint and aim for a different approach.</p>
<p>But there’s a real risk of looking at a website as a tree you should prune, rather than a library or archive of information intended to be analyzed and studied over time. The value of the tool is that it has been allowed to grow and build into a robust archive of information. If the leaves are allowed to fall off the tree, following the metaphor, the tree grows significantly less valuable.</p>
<p>Despite my well-known opinions on <a href="https://tedium.co/2020/05/15/search-engine-etiquette-backlinks/">backlink begging</a>, I don’t think search engine optimization is necessarily evil, or even a necessary evil. I think it’s something that can make a lot of sense in a lot of contexts. The problem is, when you are building a resource to last the test of time, it can feel diametrically opposed to the goals of why you created the resource in the first place.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Leaves-Laminated.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Leaves Laminated" src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Leaves-Laminated.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Can you believe that people used to laminate leaves in books for safekeeping? (<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/O6N9RV2rzX8">Jeremy Thomas/Unsplash</a>)</em></p>
<p>But to be clear, ignore what the SEO experts say: News sites should never be trimmed with a tiny pair of clippers, because all their value is in the leaves. The branches are just a conduit.</p>
<p>You wanna keep the leaf metaphor? How about this: A news site is a collection of leaves laminated in books for safekeeping. If we fail to keep them safe, what was the point of collecting the leaves?</p>
<p>CNET, for years, was doing this right. But now, with a change in ownership, it’s throwing out its laminated leaves. And that’s a damn shame.</p>
</div>
<div>
        
<p><h3>“This is an industry-wide best practice for large sites like ours that are primarily driven by SEO traffic.”</h3>
</p>
<p><strong>— CNET spokesperson Taylor Canada,</strong> speaking in the <em>Gizmodo</em> piece. You can see why CNET was fooled—just do a search for “content pruning” on Google, and you’ll find that <a href="https://yoast.com/content-pruning/">basically</a> <a href="https://www.conductor.com/academy/content-pruning/">every</a> <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remove-outdated-content">single</a> <a href="https://www.convinceandconvert.com/content-marketing/content-pruning/">SEO</a> <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/guide-seo-pruning-semrush/">expert</a> <a href="https://www.clearscope.io/blog/content-pruning">under</a> <a href="https://www.clearscope.io/blog/content-pruning">the</a> <a href="https://seoscout.com/guides/content-pruning-how-to-consolidate-pages-with-litt">sun</a> recommends content pruning as an effective strategy for removing dead weight, essentially based on perceived signals from Google. So for a top Google search expert to literally go out and say that “no, you shouldn’t do it,” as Danny Sullivan did this week, is basically throwing years of SEO “best practices” out the window with a single tweet. It’s kind of hilarious in hindsight.</p>

<h3>CNET pruning its content is a harbinger of something bigger</h3>
<p>To be clear, I am not a fan of CNET removing its content from its website in this way. It favors the present to the past, and removes important dots of context that future generations of researchers and journalists can use to tell important stories. And CNET owns perhaps the most complete archive of an important period of technology—the 1995 to 2005 period where the internet first took off, disrupted industries, and reshaped our relationship with the world.</p>
<p>But let’s be clear here. CNET is not a unique case. I am going to tell you right now that CNET is not the first website that has removed or pruned its archives, or decided to underplay them, or make them hard to access. Far from it.</p>
<p>Often, what I have noticed over the years is that websites will often go through major redesigns and decide not to pull certain types of content over. A lot gets lost in the process, and there are many reasons to not put in the work, including time, complexity, and resources.</p>
<p>Or maybe they will just not put in the work to make that information accessible without a lot of legwork.</p>
<p>To offer a few examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>USA Today</strong> is 40 years old, and has been online for 27 of those years. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/sitemap/">Its sitemap</a> only goes back to October of 2012, when it conducted a major redesign. While its content is archived in print from elsewhere, that means essentially half of its digital history is just not there. Older content, when accessible, appears to be buried at the subdomain usatoday30.usatoday.com, but that redirects to the main page and is hard to search via Google.</li>
<li><strong>Newsweek</strong> is prominently celebrating its 90th anniversary this year, but its <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/archive">archive page</a> only covers issues dating back to 2013, the year IBT Media bought the company from IAC, the parent company of <em>The Daily Beast</em>. The content from its legacy years (most famously <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/clifford-stoll-why-web-wont-be-nirvana-185306">this piece</a>) is still there and can be searched, but it is not obviously organized.</li>
<li><strong>PC World,</strong> unlike its longtime competitor CNET, does not offer an easily accessible sitemap for its content, but it a little digging around uncovers <a href="https://static.pcworld.com/sitemap/">the fact that it once did</a>, and many of the articles in the sitemap are no longer accessible. The oldest article in the PC World archives <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/535817/toshiba_libretto.html">is from 1997</a>, and odds are it was likely missed in the pruning process, because it is one of only three articles currently on the site from the 1990s.</li>
<li><strong>People.com,</strong> while its archive appears to be online, does not make it easy to access said archive, because of the way the site is designed. There is no user-accessible sitemap or easy to use pagination, and its search functionality includes no visible date on the articles.</li>
<li><strong>Pitchfork</strong> has strong historic archives at this point, in part because search is a key reason why the site works, but it has been known for removing reviews in the past, including <a href="https://deletedpitchfork.blogspot.com/">old reviews that didn’t reflect its later editorial sensibility</a>. It notably faced a particularly odd situation around the time of its purchase by Condé Nast: A onetime reviewer became a very loud critic of the site, at one point making legal threats, and the site responded by <a href="https://tktk.gawker.com/pitchfork-deletes-its-harshest-critic-1736804618">removing that writer’s entire body of work</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of these examples, the most egregious is easily USA Today, which as a national newspaper, fits under the “paper of record” category. One could argue that the company has a backstop in the form of online archives, but the company has literally decades of broken links inaccessible online. Poof.</p>
<p>Now, to be clear, I do not blame small teams struggling to keep up with the huge tide of content for being unable to maintain the past. It’s a lot of work, even in the best of circumstances. Moving from one CMS to another takes time and money, both of which are sometimes in short supply.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Broken-Links.jpg" width="799" height="533" alt="Broken Links" src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Broken-Links.jpg"></p>
<p><em>(<a href="https://flickr.com/photos/cogdog/16632103875/">Alan Levine/Flickr</a>)</em></p>
<p>But I only bring up these failings to point out that, while CNET is clearly making a mistake here, it is one that many other sites make in ways big and small every single day. The difference in the case of CNET is that it appears to be intentional and not just an oversight or the result of institutional history going away. CNET intentionally put in the work to protect its historic content in the first place, and now it’s putting in the work to bury it.</p>
<p>CNET’s editorial practices understandably have a laser focus on them right now, in no small part because the outlet was the first to start publishing AI-generated content. But let’s not give the rest of the media world a pass because CNET was the one in the headline.</p>
<p>These articles help expose the past; they were the hard work of people who spent a lot of time building them.</p>
</div>
<div>
    
<h3>Five news sites that do their archives exceptionally well</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>The New York Times.</strong> I have my problems with them in part because of <a href="https://tedium.co/2023/02/18/new-york-times-archives-open-letter-controversy/">their handling of trans issues</a>, but they really set the standard that the rest of the industry has followed.</li>
<li><strong>The Washington Post.</strong> Not only are many of their articles accessible digitally (I have linked stories from them from the 1970s), but they offer their subscribers access to their print archives via ProQuest, making their content accessible at a level familiar to many academics.</li>
<li><strong>Time Magazine.</strong> Nearly every Time Magazine cover from the start of its history until today is accessible <a href="https://time.com/vault/">from its vault</a>, and many of its articles are also freely accessible.</li>
<li><strong>The New Yorker.</strong> It not only offers full scans of its magazine archive to subscribers, it also takes time to <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/archive">resurface its archive content</a> on the website.</li>
<li><strong>The Los Angeles Times.</strong> While <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives">the newspaper’s archive site</a> shunts off the newspapers themselves to Newspapers.com, it has <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sitemap">a strong historic sitemap</a> that includes full articles from 1985 on and a selection of pieces from prior years.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>
    
<p><strong>I think an important distinction to make here, as I close this piece out,</strong> is that we should not expect the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine to save us. Sure, it certainly can, and its affiliated archive.it site has collected much of CNET’s history.</p>
<p>But we should not expect it. The Internet Archive is an important resource, but it is a fallible one and an overworked one. These companies have the money and resources. They should be the ones protecting their own work. The Internet Archive is there to clean up your mess, not excuse your failings.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we should encourage better standards from publishers and other players in the content ecosystem. The reason why this content dies is because not enough work has been done to properly value it.</p>
<p>There are at least three distinct ways I could see other sites not fall down the CNET trap in the digital era:</p>

<p>I think CNET is making a mistake, but they’ve also identified a serious problem for the digital news ecosystem: Old content is a burden to carry, and intentionally or not, Google isn’t making that lift any easier.</p>
<p>I think as researchers, journalists, and SEO heads, we need to put our heads together to figure out ways to make maintaining historic content look less like a burden and more like an opportunity.</p>
<p>Our history is at risk if we can’t.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  Linear algebraic primitives are at the core of many modern algorithms in
engineering, science, and machine learning. Hence, accelerating these
primitives with novel computing hardware would have tremendous economic impact.
Quantum computing has been proposed for this purpose, although the resource
requirements are far beyond current technological capabilities, so this
approach remains long-term in timescale. Here we consider an alternative
physics-based computing paradigm based on classical thermodynamics, to provide
a near-term approach to accelerating linear algebra.
<br>At first sight, thermodynamics and linear algebra seem to be unrelated
fields. In this work, we connect solving linear algebra problems to sampling
from the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution of a system of coupled harmonic
oscillators. We present simple thermodynamic algorithms for (1) solving linear
systems of equations, (2) computing matrix inverses, (3) computing matrix
determinants, and (4) solving Lyapunov equations. Under reasonable assumptions,
we rigorously establish asymptotic speedups for our algorithms, relative to
digital methods, that scale linearly in matrix dimension. Our algorithms
exploit thermodynamic principles like ergodicity, entropy, and equilibration,
highlighting the deep connection between these two seemingly distinct fields,
and opening up algebraic applications for thermodynamic computing hardware.

<h2>What is VirGL?<a href="#what-is-virgl" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>VirGL is a virtual 3D GPU for use inside QEMU virtual machines, that
allows the guest operating system to use the capabilities of the host GPU
to accelerate 3D rendering. The plan is to have a guest GPU that is fully
independent of the host GPU.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-exactly-does-it-entail">
<h2>What exactly does it entail?<a href="#what-exactly-does-it-entail" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The project entails creating a virtual 3D capable graphics card for
virtual machines running inside QEMU. The design of this card is based
around the concepts of Gallium3D to make writing Mesa and (eventually)
Direct3D drivers for it easy. The card natively uses the Gallium TGSI
intermediate representation for its shaders. The implementation of
rendering for the card is done in the host system as part of QEMU and is
implemented purely on OpenGL so you can get accelerated rendering on any
sufficiently capable card/driver combination.</p>
<p>The project also consists of a complete Linux guest stack, composed of a
Linux kernel KMS driver, X.org 2D DDX driver and Mesa 3D driver.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Many pieces are now upstreamed in various projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Kernel Linux 4.2 contains the modesetting only drivers. Linux 4.4
contains the 3D supported pieces.</p></li>
<li><p>Mesa main contains the VirGL 3D driver.</p></li>
<li><p>QEMU 2.4 contained the initial virtio-gpu with no acceleration
support. QEMU 2.5 contains 3D support only with the GTK3 frontend with
GL enabled.</p></li>

<p>Ode to the M1</p><hr>


<p>It is not often I am blown away by a piece of hardware. My Hall of Fame features the 1991 Super Nintendo, the 1995 3dfx1, and the 2010 Intel's Serie 520 SSD<a name="back_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. This past month my 2021 MacBook Pro M1<a name="back_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> joined the club.</p>


<p>My problem</p><hr><p>Much has been written about the performance and the battery life of the M1. I won't elaborate on that. Even though these alone would warrant much praise, it is for my peculiar usecase that the machine shines.</p>

<p>I spend my time either writing code or articles. Linux is perfect for that. But every once in a while that OS eats my time. Spending time figuring out why fractional scaling broke after an update, why that Thunderbolt SSD won't mount<a name="back_3" href="#footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, or why it won't print is nerve wrecking. These rare, yet ragging, moments make me miss MacOS X.</p>

<p>As a retro-gamimg enthusiast, I may need to use an emulator to study a game's internals. Inevitably, I end up needing to run Windows.</p>

<p>Missed connection</p><hr><p>I attempted to solve my problem via KVM on a beloved Thinkpad Carbon Gen 9. It took me forever to get something running. Dealing with Windows 11 TPM requirements was a nightmare. And I never managed to have something stable. Not to mention the battery life was abysmal.</p>

<p>UTM</p><hr><p><a href="https://mac.getutm.app/">UTM</a> works. It was painless to set up both Ubuntu and Windows 11 with a few clicks. I spent 1mn creating both VMs<a name="back_4" href="#footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. It allows me to have all three OSes a simple swipe motion away. Both Ubuntu and Windows run at native speed since they are virtualized instead of emulated.</p>

  <source src="https://fabiensanglard.net/m1/magic1080.mov" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.

<p>The ability to share files in <code>rw</code> mode made writing and testing cross-platform mDNS software<a name="back_5" href="#footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> something almost enjoyable. At the very least it gave me the satisfaction of iterating at maximum speed.</p>


<p>Concerns</p><hr><p>At this point, the M1 is a dream hypervisor. I wish I could freeze time on this setup. I have only two concerns.</p>

<h2>Software engineers</h2>
<p>For every extra cycle an hardware engineer can squeeze out of silicon, you will find a programmer adding one hundred cycles to their program<a name="back_6" href="#footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>. In other terms, I fear that once devs figure out how powerful the M1 is, they will throw more "features" at it.</p>

<h2>Enterprising</h2>
<p>UTM is simple, lightweight, and easy to set up. It is gorgeous and a pleasure to use. Just browse their website<a name="back_7" href="#footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>, see the clean gallery<a name="back_8" href="#footnote_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>, and read the useful setup guide. My fear is that something purchases them and we end up with a confusing mess of Enterprise flavors a la VMWare.</p>

<p dir="auto">With the goal of ending this current limbo and soothe longstanding tensions in the Nix community, this RFC does two things:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Establish general principles about Nix's architecture and evolution in order to ensure we do not get in this situation again.</p>
<p dir="auto">Notably we are allowed to make breaking changes to experimental features, which includes both the new CLI and Flakes, until they are stable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Establish an incremental plan adhering to the principles deciding on the order and priority in which to stabilize these features:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">First, the non-Flakes CLI wll be stabilized, in phases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Afterwards, Flakes itself and its CLI components can be stabilized. The final design of Flakes will also require another RFC.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto"><em>A note to anyone leaving comments, remember the point of this RFC is <em>not</em> to debate the <strong>content</strong> of what is being stabilized, but debate the <strong>process</strong> of stabilization. To my fellow Flakes skeptics in particular, please hold back on the minutiae what you think is wrong with the design of Flakes, the new CLI or other features, or we will end up with another monster RFC thread that goes nowhere.</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><em>The current trajectory as far as I can tell, prior to writing this. is that we all of the sudden get a Nix 3.0 where a huge swath of stuff without review becomes stable at once. This is because many people in charge feel exhausted, and fear properly audit and debate the new features will devolve into yet another messy useless flame war.</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Only by keeping the conversation narrowly on topic can demonstrate that a cordial compromise is possible</em></p>

      <p dir="auto">This is the crux of the issue, and I can't agree with it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Going into an effort to stabilise Flakes with the understanding that we can't actually change it very much would make a mockery of the RFC process as a whole.  It would establish a precedent that following the RFC process is optional, and that if you don't want to follow it (and you're one of the privileged set of committers to the appropriate repository) you can work around it encouraging adoption of your "experimental" work until it gets to the point that "we can't make big changes" any more.  Maybe the Flakes design is good enough that we wouldn't <em>need</em> to make huge drastic changes, but it still sets the same precedent if we go into it having accepted that we <em>can't</em>.</p>

      <p dir="auto">I think Flakes 2.0 may not necessary be new features.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/alyssais/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/alyssais">@alyssais</a> I agree Flakes was advertised much more heavily than, say, Rust experimental features, which does make the whole process very dodgy. But I have also long since given up on trying to influence Flakes. <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/edolstra/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/edolstra">@edolstra</a> and others have a very specific vision on what UX they want for them, and I think a fine compromise is that they can basically do whatever they want with that <em>so long as</em> there remains a "rest of Nix" that is still fully functional and not an afterthought with huge gaps.</p>
<p dir="auto">In other words, I would <em>personally</em> work very hard to make sure the first two round of stabilizations under the plan yield a good result, making requests for some small tweak dyed-in-the-whole Flakers find baffling or boring. But then for the 3rd round, I would largely bow out, having gotten the things I wanted.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now, I am by no means demanding that persons besides myself do the same; there is still a 3rd round of stabilization for those interested in Flakes to voice their thoughts. But I gather a lot of the tensions around Flakes is predicated on a fear that Flakes will be the only way forward, with the non-Flakes functionality legacy stuff or otherwise left to rot. I think by making sure that the non-Flakes stuff is still good, or at least leaving room for that (e.g. we can rename <code>nix search</code> to <code>nix flake search</code> leaving room for the future re-emergence of Flake-agnostic searching) we can lower the temperature a lot in the room not only for people like me, but also for people that still care about Flakes being good (in their eyes) but can rest easier with there being a "plan B".</p>

      <p dir="auto">I would say that pushing flakes through an imitation RFC process without properly addressing the criticism would damage RFC process without really adding anything to flakes (hard to get extra credibility from the process that just lost its credibility).</p>
<p dir="auto">I guess with incremental stabilisation of Flakes we could reach a state where some things can neither be stabilised via an RFC nor removed via an RFC? I don't like this outcome too much, but maybe this would at least reduce the splash damage…</p>

Saying "flakes are widely used, so we can't break interfaces even if they're not declared stable" is flawed reasoning. <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/tomberek/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/tomberek">@tomberek</a> recently pointed out to me that leading figures have been encouraging users to adopt flakes since NixCon 2019. And it still happens in side channels all the time, new users being introduced with <em>literally</em> saying "it's fine, just enable experimental features, it's the right way to do things" or "it's strongly encouraged" – by whom?</p>
<p dir="auto">These are people's opinions, they are free to have them, and others are free to believe them, but the manual and the guards in the code clearly state: this interface is subject to change.</p>
<p dir="auto">Don't rely on experimental features in production, unless you know what you're doing and know how to get yourself out of a mess. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/yXPQdZh8o7c?feature=share&amp;t=958" rel="nofollow">There is no deadline on stabilising the new CLI or flakes, because we don't want to get stuck with what we may end up regretting.</a></p>
<p dir="auto">I'm not in the position to conclusively judge and not willing to opine whether the new CLI design or the flakes paradigm of organising Nix projects are the right way forward and whether the improvements in user experience are worth the sunk cost. But I'm confident with stating that the kind of signaling and narrative we have observed</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Confuses beginners, produces uncertainty, and associates these negative emotions with the project, which tend to stick due to the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial-position_effect#Primacy_effect" rel="nofollow">primacy effect</a></li>
<li>Reinforces distrust in Nix maintainers among new users, who we can expect soon to be the overwhelming majority</li>
<li>Exerts needless constraints and pressure on maintainers where the whole point of experimental features is, well, to be able to experiment, and therefore having the freedom to make breaking changes.</li>

          <p dir="auto">Thanks for fleshing this out (and sorry for taking that long to answer).</p>
<p dir="auto">I agree with the broad idea of stabilizing stuff incrementally. There's a huge pile of experimental stuff, ranging from “experimental on the paper, but too widely used to be changed” to “actually experimental, we might drop it tomorrow”.</p>
<p dir="auto">The problem that makes this whole thing much more complex is that Flakes and the new CLI are strongly tied together:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>On the one hand, the CLI is built around Flakes as the primary interface to Nix expressions. Which means that I'm quite anxious at the idea of trying to stabilize the CLI without flakes as it would be very hard to provide something nice and consistent.</li>
<li>On the other hand, a large part of the design of Flakes is here to provide a good user interface. Being able to just run <code>nix run nixpkgs#hello</code> is magical, and that's to a large part tied to the design of flakes. Which means that inverting the order to stabilize flakes first and the CLI after would also be weird.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">All that being said, I think I'd favour trying to stabilize Flakes first for consistency reasons: A Nix with Flakes but not the new CLI would be a Nix with a not-so-obviously-good feature hidden somewhere within the language (under <code>builting.getFlake</code>). However, a Nix with the new CLI but no Flakes is a Nix where the primary user interface has a huge blind spot, which is frankly bad.</p>

<li>
<p dir="auto">It is perfectly OK if the CLI without Flakes isn't <em>nice</em>!</p>

<li>
<p dir="auto">That full unstable CLI is still there, and we can make sure it is <em>consistent</em> with or without Flakes.</p>

<p dir="auto">OK, so the CLI without Flakes will not have <code>nix run</code>. Simple!</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Which means that inverting the order to stabilize flakes first and the CLI after would also be weird.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I don't think it is hard to stabilize <code>nix show-derivation</code> and <code>nix eval</code> without <code>nix run</code>. <code>nix run</code> doesn't affect the design of those first two plumbing commands, does it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">However, a Nix with the new CLI but no Flakes is a Nix where the primary user interface has a huge blind spot, which is frankly bad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">We'd be just stabilizing the plumbing commands. Blind spots are completely acceptable and expected.</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">I am guessing this is a simple understanding where you thought by "stabilize flakes" I meant just the file format; I mean the file format <em>and</em> the CLI commands that are tied to it. They go together, and the value of one <em>does</em> depend on the other. Trying to stabilize those in isolation would mean we are unable to judge the merits of either properly.</p>
<p dir="auto">I do think some of those Flakes commands (like <code>nix search</code>) could be made Flakes agnostic, but as I hoped to make clear I do <em>not</em> want to block the stabilizing of anything on making them Flakes agnostic. At most, I would advocate renaming things like <code>nix flakes run</code> and <code>nix flakes search</code> to "make room" for future generalized variants.</p>

      <p dir="auto">I also disagree with that proposal. The transition from regular nix to flakes nix is not always easy and can't be done all at once. Being able to use the same store and switch back-and-forth between using flakes and not is critical to prevent splitting the userbase.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, I think this RFC opens the door to creating one or multiple experimental flake-based frontends based on the lower-level Nix Store and Nix Language. So you can still make breaking changes, but they are scoped and more experimentation is possible.</p>

I think the scope of the RFC is ok expanded, but what I would do is I would keep this RFC as a "plan" and then do RFCs separated for every step, which would go into more detail. In my view, it is ok to have an RFC that presents the context, history, reasons for the plan, and what the plan is.</p>
<p dir="auto">Having something too big in scope for what we would like is inevitable at this point, as this is basically the RFC process "catching up" on years of work "outside of the process".</p>
<p dir="auto">On a different note. I fully support the plan to separate cli from core in your comments above, but I also understand if it does not happen.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of container technology, Podman’s latest version, v4.6.0, includes a feature that promises to be a game-changer for system administrators: Podmansh. A login shell that leverages Podman’s robust container management capabilities. Podmansh is set to redefine the way users interact with systems, while ensuring maximum security and control for administrators.</p>







<h2>Why Podmansh?</h2>



<p>Managing access to resources is a crucial task for system administrators. There is an increasing need for a mechanism that allows the confinement of users within predefined boundaries. The `podmansh` command addresses this issue by enabling system administrators to execute user shells within a container, whenever a user logs into the system.</p>







<h2>How It Works</h2>



<p>Administrators configure users on their system to use the `/usr/bin/podmansh` command rather than a normal shell command like `/bin/bash`. When a user logs into a system setup in this manner, the Podmansh command will exec the user’s session in a rootless&nbsp; container named `podmansh`. The Podman container `podmansh` is automatically started by systemd when the user session starts, and continues running until all user sessions exit.</p>



<p>Containers that users log in are defined via <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2021/10/12/quadlet-an-easier-way-to-run-system-containers/">Quadlet</a> files. Administrators can control the visibility of the host system in the container via volumes – specified for them in a Quadlet file. Administrators can also limit the access, security privileges, as well as resource constraints of the logged in users via the Quadlet settings.</p>



<p>Administrators create Quadlet files in the /etc/containers/systemd/users directory. Systemd will then initialize it for all users upon login. For instance, an administrator can create a specific Quadlet named `Podmansh` and enable users to use the login shell /usr/bin/podmansh. These user login shells will automatically execute within the Podmansh container via Podman.</p>



<p>For more granular control, administrators can place Quadlet files in the /etc/containers/systemd/users/${USER_ID} directory for each user. Consequently, only the specified USER_ID will execute these Quadlet services when that user logs in.</p>







<h2>Setup</h2>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, create a user login session using useradd while running as root, followed by creation of a Quadlet file in /etc/containers/systemd/users/${USER_ID}.</p>



<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Fully locked down container, no access to host OS.</p>



<figure><div># useradd -s /usr/bin/podmansh lockedu# grep lockedu /etc/passwd<br>lockedu:x:4008:4008::/home/lockedu:/usr/bin/podmansh# USER_ID=$(id -u lockedu)<br># mkdir -p /etc/containers/systemd/users/${USER_ID}<br># cat &gt; /etc/containers/systemd/users/${USER_ID}/podmansh.container &lt;&lt; _EOF<br>[Unit]<br>Description=The Podmansh container<br>After=local-fs.target<p>[Container]<br>Image=registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora<br>ContainerName=podmansh<br>RemapUsers=keep-id<br>RunInit=yes<br>DropCapability=all<br>NoNewPrivileges=true</p><p>Exec=sleep infinity</p><p>[Install]<br>RequiredBy=default.target<br>_EOF</p></div></figure>



<p>Notice a few fields in the Quadlet file under the [Container] section.</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Image=registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora</strong><br>This option tells Podman to download the fedora image to run the container within.&nbsp; Administrators can pick specific container images to launch users in, which could be different than the host system.</li>



<li><strong>ContainerName=podmansh<br></strong>The container name must be `podmansh` as /usr/bin/podmansh always does a `podman exec` into the `podmansh` container.</li>



<li><strong>RemapUsers=keep-id<br></strong>This option will map the user’s USER_ID as itself within the container. Without this field, the user would login as root of the user namespace.</li>



<li><strong>RunInit=yes<br></strong>This tells podman to launch an init process within the container which will cleanup any zombie processes inside of the container</li>



<li><strong>DropCapability=all</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>This option tells Podman to drop all capabilities inside of the container and prevents the container process from ever getting any capabilities on the system, even if it figured out a way to escape the container.</p>



<ol start="6">
<li><strong>NoNewPrivileges=true<br></strong>This option goes a step further and prevents the container from ever getting any new privileges in addition to capabilities.</li>



<li><strong>Exec=sleep infinity</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>The last field to look at is the Exec command. Most of the time we recommend that the user’s session just goes to sleep in a Podmansh container. This prevents the session from using resources on the system.&nbsp; Since user sessions are execed into the container, they would be running the default /bin/sh inside of the container image.</p>



<p>If you really want to lock the user into the container, you could even add a flag like</p>



<p>Network=none. This option would remove all network access from the processes within the container. Meaning the container process can not reach other nodes via the network, from its point of view there is no network on the box. You could also set up the container to be ReadOnly=true, which would prevent the user from writing anywhere but on tmpfs directories in `/run` and `/tmp`.</p>



<p>Quadlet containers are removed from the system when the user’s session is exited, meaning anything that the user wrote to the container image will be removed when the user sessions terminate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next example will allow a user to save content in his home directory.</p>



<p>Example 2: Alternatively, while running as root, create a Quadlet where the user is allowed to become root within the user namespace. They can also permanently read/write content from their home directory which is a volume mounted from the actual host’s users account, rather than being inside of the container.</p>



<figure><div># useradd -s /usr/bin/podmansh confinedu<br># grep confinedu /etc/passwd<br>confinedu:x:4009:4009::/home/confinedu:/usr/bin/podmansh<br># USER_ID=$(id -u confinedu)<br># mkdir -p /etc/containers/systemd/users/${USER_ID}<br># cat &gt; /etc/containers/systemd/users/${USER_ID}/podmansh.container &lt;&lt; _EOF<br>[Unit]<br>Description=The Podmansh container<br>After=local-fs.target<p>[Container]<br>Image=registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora<br>ContainerName=podmansh<br>RemapUsers=keep-id<br>RunInit=yes</p><p>Volume=%h/data:%h:Z<br>Exec=sleep infinity</p><p>[Service]<br>ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/mkdir -p %h/data</p><p>[Install]<br>RequiredBy=default.target<br>_EOF</p></div></figure>



<p>Notice in this example the first four fields in the [Container] structure are the same as the previous example. And the Exec command is still `sleep infinity`. But we removed the security lockdowns of DropCapabilties and NoNewPrivileges. Without these restrictions the user session can become root within his user namespace and could do certain privileged activities like installing packages (even though they currently will not persist). Realize that this is a rootless container, which means the user processes are not really root (uid=0) on the host system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A couple of additional lines have been added to the Quadlet.</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>&nbsp;Volume=%h/data:%h:Z<br></strong>This line tells Podman to volume mount the data directory in the users homedir into the container onto his homedir. The :Z tells SELinux systems to label the data directory to match the containers label. %h tells systemd to expand this field into the user’s homedir when calling Podman. Since the `data` directory is volume mounted into the container it will survive outside of the container for use the next time the users logs into the system.</li>



<li><strong>[Service]<br>ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/mkdir -p %h/data</strong><br>This section tells systemd to precreate the data directory in the user’s home directory on the host before launching the container.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Alternatively, while running as root, create a Quadlet where the user is allowed to become root within the user namespace. They can also permanently read/write content from their home directory which is volume mounted from the actual host’s user’s account, rather than being inside of the container.</p>



<figure><div># useradd -s /usr/bin/podmansh volumeu<br># grep volumeu /etc/passwd<br>volumeu:x:4010:4010::/home/volumeu:/usr/bin/podmansh<br># USER_ID=$(id -u volumeu)<br># mkdir -p /etc/containers/systemd/users/${USER_ID}<br># cat &gt; /etc/containers/systemd/users/${USER_ID}/podmansh.container &lt;&lt; _EOF<br>[Unit]<br>Description=The Podmansh container<br>After=local-fs.target<p>[Container]<br>Image=registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9<br>ContainerName=podmansh<br>RemapUsers=keep-id<br>RunInit=yes</p><p>Device=/dev/nvidia123Volume=/secret/data:/secret:ro<br>Exec=sleep infinity</p><p>[Install]<br>RequiredBy=default.target<br>_EOF</p></div></figure>



<p>Notice in this last example that two fields were added to allow read-only access to a specific volume on the host, and an nVidia device was added to the container. The image was changed to ubi9 to highlight the fact that you can have multiple Podmansh Quadlets, one for each user, and these Quadlets can use different images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A couple of additional lines have been added to the Quadlet.</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Device=/dev/nvidia123</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>The device line will add this device to the container to be used by the user session</p>



<ol start="2">
<li><strong>&nbsp;Volume=/secret/data:/secret:ro<br></strong>This line tells Podman to volume mount the /secret/data directory as /secret inside of the container as a read only mount. The idea here would be to allow apps within the container image to use the device to process data in the /secret directory.</li>
</ol>



<p>This last example would allow administrators to expose different parts of the system to different users depending on their security level.</p>



<h2>Security &amp; Confidentiality</h2>



<p>Users are confined to their container environment with all the security mechanisms in place, including SELinux. Any system information that becomes available within the container is strictly limited to volumes leaked into the container, ensuring a high level of security and isolation.<br></p>



<h2>Seamless Operation</h2>



<p>Once a user session starts, systemd automatically creates the associated container. As all connections to the user session are removed, systemd takes down the container. This means users can log into the system multiple times, with each session connecting to the same container, providing a seamless user experience.</p>



<p>Moreover, administrators have the power to expose specific host data from the host system to the user through volumes. This can be done without exposing the user to other parts of the system, maintaining the integrity and security of the overall system.<br></p>



<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>



<p>In conclusion, Podman v4.6’s new feature, Podmansh, is set to revolutionize how system administrators manage user access and control, all while maintaining an impressive level of security and confidentiality. It’s a groundbreaking step in the world of container technology, providing a new way for users to interact with systems.</p>

<section>
<p>After learning a little bit more about web accessibility last year I had been exploring some of the less common <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> elements, and making changes to this website, like wrapping the text of the posts on this blog in <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tags and adding a <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag in the website’s layout templates (this website is built using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank">Eleventy</a>).</p>
<p>I had previously done some work to make sure that <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> elements were layed out nicely for images with associated captions, and I had been impressed with various <a href="https://www.recurse.com/" target="_blank">Recurser’s</a> implementation of footnotes or sidenotes<sub id="footnote-1-link"><a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/blog/a-blog-post-with-every-html-element/#footnote-1">1</a></sub>, and have been thinking it would be interesting to see what other interesting layouts were possible with just HTML.</p>
<p>I could, element by element, continue to add support (mostly by making <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> updates for each element to fit in with the rest of my style choices) as I came across specific needs for them, but not one to shy away from an exhaustive exploration, I decided to write this post and attempt to use every element.</p>
<p>A goal of the post, was to avoid delaying other future posts with CSS updates on a previously unused element, but in reality it took a year and a half to make all the updates for just this post! I am using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs list of HTML elements</a> as a reference which has more than 100 tags divided into a few categories, which I will also use in this post. Many of the tags like <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> don’t make sense to include in the text of a blog post, but if you’re viewing this post on <a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/">patrickweaver.net</a>, then every one of the elements is used somewhere on this page.</p>
</section>

<h2>The Elements</h2>
<section id="main-root">
<h3>Main Root</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html"><code>&lt;html&gt;</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t have to make any changes to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag for this post, but one thing I don’t always remember to include is the <code>lang</code> property (in this case <code>lang="en"</code>).</p>
</section>
<section id="document-metadata">
<h3>Document Metadata</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base"><code>&lt;base&gt;</code></a></li>

<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title"><code>&lt;title&gt;</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I wasn’t familiar with the <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> tag before writing this post, though I’ve now added one with relative links to my layout templates. This caused a few issues with things like local development, and relative links, though they were easily resolved. The rest of the metadata tags are familiar and were already here.</p>

</ul>
<p>Like the Document metadata tags, in the layout, though it was interesting to read the documentation and learn about attributes, like <code>onbeforeprint</code> that provides functionality I’ve used more hacky methods to accomplish previously, and <code>onblur</code>, whose primary utility seems to be annoying popups.</p>

</ul>
<p>When I first looked at the list I assumed that <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> would be designed exclusively for mailing addresses, but was surprised to see that it can be used for email addresses, and even links. I updated the email address on the About page of site site, but I’ll add an <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> below also:</p>
<address>
    <p>Email Patrick:</p>
    <a href="mailto:hello.patrickw@gmail.com">hello.patrickw@gmail.com</a>
</address>
<p>As I mentioned above, I updated the blog post page template to use the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag, but reading the documentation, I’m now wondering if it would fit on every page of the site.</p>
<p>I’m now using <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> elements, which represent, <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside">a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document’s main content</q>, to wrap around my footnotes at the bottom of this page (though I may try to style them as sidenotes in the future). The current design of this website doesn’t have a <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, but I’ve added one to this blog post, and while I had a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element on the page header previously, I now know that more than one is acceptable so there is one around the header section of each blog posts as well.</p>
<h4>Heading elements</h4>
<p>As part of the style update and cleanup of this site that inspired this post I realized I was often using headers with incorrect hierarchy, which I cleaned up. Though I never reached 6 levels of headers, the closest I got was <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> in some of the blog posts with multiple sections and subsections.</p>
<h5>How to use top level headings</h5>
<p>It is a little bit unclear how to use <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tags in a post like this from just the MDN documentation. This <a href="https://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/Use_h1_for_Title">tip from the W3C</a> suggests different implementations for pages with standalone, or collection content, which would make it difficult to use the same templates and styles for different pages on this site.</p>
<h6>How I decided to handle it</h6>
<p>Before writing this post I had updated the site to use <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for the name of the site (my name) at the top, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> for the section name, for this page, “Blog”, and <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> for the title of what would be the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> on a page. However, after reading the documentation and the tip above, I decided to update the hierarchy and use <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for different things on different pages, and use classes for styles, which is probably more in line with the separation of concerns of HTML and CSS (which means this paragraph is below an <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>Sometime between when I started this experiment in early 2022 and when I published it in Summer 2023 <code>&lt;hgroup&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;search&gt;</code> were added to the MDN documentation (which I realize is not the official spec). I’ve added an <code>&lt;hgroup&gt;</code> around the heading of this section, with a subtitle <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element. <code>&lt;search&gt;</code> is a semantic element that indicates that an input can be used for search, not for search results (with the exception of quick results that populate within a form ). While a <code>&lt;search&gt;</code> element that contains a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> works without HTML on a website that can generate search results on a server, because this website is statically generated the example below requires JavaScript. I haven’t seen a <code>&lt;search&gt;</code> element anywhere else, neither MDN’s header search, or google.com use it in 2023.</p>

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 MD013 -->
<p>The <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element was one of the initial curiosities that led me down the path of reading about and implementing every element, though it wasn’t until I read through the MDN list that I added a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element around the menu at the top of this page. I’ve added <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> elements to this post, but I’m not sure how often I will use them elsewhere. One reason is that it makes it harder to mix and match HTML and markdown with visually clear nesting in the <a href="https://github.com/patrickweaver/pw20/blob/main/build/blog/a-blog-post-with-every-html-element.md">document where I am writing this post</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>I had previously used <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> for embedding tweets into blog posts, but for this post I decided to add styles for standalone quotes. I didn’t know about the <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> <code>cite</code> property or <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> element until reading the docs more closely:</p>
<figure>
    <blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote#attributes">
        <h4><code>cite</code></h4>
        <p>A URL that designates a source document or message for the information quoted. This attribute is intended to point to information explaining the context or the reference for the quote.</p>
    <figcaption><cite>MDN</cite> on <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code></figcaption>
</blockquote></figure>
<p><code>&lt;dd&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> are elements that, after finding out about them when first looking into more obscure HTML elements, I was very surprised to have not known about sooner. Although, it’s unclear from the documentation whether lists like the links on the current version of my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220628123804/https://www.patrickweaver.net/portfolio/">portfolio page</a> should use <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> (I’m currently using <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>). I am curious how <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> became part of almost every “Intro to HTML” class, but <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> is relatively obscure. It’s also strange that <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> have default margins, but for <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> the margin is on <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code>.</p>
<h4>HTML list elements</h4>
<dl>
    <dt><code>dl</code></dt><dd>Description list</dd>
    <dt><code>ol</code></dt><dd>Ordered list</dd>
    <dt><code>ul</code></dt><dd>Unordered list</dd>
</dl>
<p><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> has acquired a bad reputation on the modern web due to overuse, so I was surprised to be using relatively few <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements, though once I started using elements that I wanted to style together, I ended up with around 20. It shows how unnecessary most <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s probably are, though this site has minimal generic “sections”.</p>
<p>Among the first more obscure elements that I added to this site were <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>. I was adding some blog posts that had originally been published on Medium, and wanted to add captions below images in a web-semantically correct way. Though after reading the documentation, which says <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> can be used for, <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure#usage_notes">image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc.,</q> I realized that there are a lot of places where I currently have code blocks that I could be using them.</p>
<p>I have always liked <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> elements a lot, but I’m never sure when to use them. The documentation says, <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hr#try_it">While it may still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers, this element is now defined in semantic terms, rather than presentational terms, so if you wish to draw a horizontal line, you should do so using appropriate CSS</q> which made me revisit the <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> styles on this site and I decided to include an emoji in an <code>hr:after</code> rule, though I should check how that works on a screen reader.</p>
<p>The items in the (inline styled) lists of elements on this page are of course <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements, though I had never looked at the documentation until now. It’s interesting that the same <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element is used in both <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> lists, with quirks like <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li#attributes">The value attribute has no meaning for unordered lists</q>, but is not used to wrap the <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> elements in a <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>I had not encountered <code>&lt;menu&gt;</code> before writing this post, and I was initially surprised that it survived to HTML 5 (while <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/menuitem"><code>&lt;menuitem&gt;</code></a> didn’t) because modern browsers treat it as essentially a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>. Researching further <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Basic_text">on Wikipedia</a> I read:</p>
<figure>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Basic_text">MENU existed in HTML Tags, and was standardized in HTML 2.0; deprecated in HTML 4.0 Transitional; invalid in HTML 4.0 Strict; then redefined in HTML5, but removed in HTML 5.2,</blockquote>
</figure>and now I don’t know what to think, but here’s a <code>&lt;menu&gt;</code>:

<p><code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> are some of the HTML elements I used in my earliest web pages, and more recently I try to use <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> with CSS in places that are semantically lists, but might not be styled like a traditional list.</p>
<p>I was surprised not to find more guidance on using <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p">the MDN docs</a>, something I wonder often when adding non long form text to a website is, “is this really a paragraph?” But, it seems like as far as HTML is concerned, if it’s not a heading, then probably!</p>
<p>Before reading the documentation I had really only considered using <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tags along with <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tags for code blocks, but the example used on MDN is used to show how <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> can display meaningful whitespace for things like:</p>

<p>As with other very common tags I was curious to get to the documentation for <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> to see if there was anything I was unaware of, or had been using incorrectly. I was surprised to discover that <code>&lt;a href="#"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;</code> links to the top of the page after years as just using it as a placeholder when I didn’t know the URL yet.</p>
<p><code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> seems likely to be the least used tag, especially because the MDN documentation doesn’t make a great case for it <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr#default_styling">the purpose of this element is purely for the convenience of the author.</q></p>
<p>The distinction between <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>, as the docs have it, is not what I had previously thought (that <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> was the HTML5 replacement for <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>). I think the distinction is more nuanced and overlapping than the technical nature of the documentation is really able to convey. The way I will probably explain it to other people in the future is that, for the most part, you should use <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> for <b>single words</b> (or compound words), <strong>and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> for whole sentences or phrases</strong>. This is more a rule of thumb and bypasses the actual distinction. The documentation reads:</p>
<figure>
    <blockquote>
        The <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element is for content that is of greater importance, while the <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> element is used to draw attention to text without indicating that it’s more important.
    </blockquote>
    <figcaption>
        <cite><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong#b_vs._strong">MDN on “<code>&lt;b&gt;</code> vs. <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>”</a></cite>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But I can’t think of many instances where I would want to draw attention to a word, where that word is not more important than other words. The recommendation seems to be from a reality where, for the most part, all words are of equal importance, but deserve different amounts of attention, which doesn’t seem very common.</p>
<p>I’ll probably think of <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> from now on as the HTML tag with a similar effect as the quotation marks used for “emphasis” you might see on signage that can cause intergenerational confusion.</p>
<p><code>&lt;bdi&gt;</code> is a tag for a concept that I hadn’t considered until now, text whose direction might (or might not) differ from the direction of the surrounding text. The examples on the documentation are all names, but could stand in for any user inputted text. In the future I will probably try to wrap any tags, like the ones controlled by the input below, that might contain arbitrary user inputted unicode characters in a <code>&lt;bdi&gt;</code> tag just to be safe.</p>

<p>Hello, <bdi id="bdi-name-display">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</bdi>, thanks for reading!</p>



<p><code>&lt;bdo&gt;</code> I will probably use less often because I don’t work with RTL languages often, but it is still good to know how to handle small amounts of RTL text, like this link to the page for HTML on the Farsi Wikipedia: <a href="https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%DA%86%E2%80%8C%D8%AA%DB%8C%E2%80%8C%D8%A7%D9%85%E2%80%8C%D8%A7%D9%84" target="_blank"><bdo dir="rtl">اچ‌تی‌ام‌ال</bdo></a>.</p>
<p><code>&lt;br&gt;</code> is interesting to me, because for a time (a long time ago) it seemed to be as misused as <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> has been recently, but, as CSS has gotten more robust that is probably less often the case; though I wonder if it is still taught early in HTML classes. It’s interesting that the example use case in the docs is poetry because it makes me wonder how the grey area between a paragraph and a standalone line was considered in creating the HTML spec. It also seems like a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag might be a better fit in some cases.</p>
<p><code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> are interesting because they try to add HTML semantic elements for meaning that is also conveyed by visible punctuation in most languages. It’s the kind of redundancy that underscores repetitiousness of working with computers (the default style for <cite>cite</cite> uses italics while <q cite="this is not really a quotation">q</q> adds quotation marks not in the text.).</p>
<p>I’ve clearly used many <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> elements in this post so far, but reading the documentation made me wonder whether the recently released Markdown support in Google Docs uses <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> for text, but on inspecting the HTML of a Doc, I remembered that <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> is used to render the document now.</p>
<p>Occasionally the MDN documentation examples are difficult to mentally translate to real-world use cases. <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> is one of these, where the ony examples show a <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> element with a <code>value</code> property with product IDs wrapped around product names In that case the IDs seem either, user facing, in which case it would probably be better to display them to the user, or non user facing, in which case, I’m not sure who the “data” is for. Interestingly, <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> doesn’t seem to appear in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/">W3C HTML5 specification</a>.</p>
<p><code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code> is another strange element because it seems like it is misnamed, as it wraps, not the definition of a term, but instead that term within the definition. It does <a href="http://www.martinrinehart.com/frontend-engineering/engineers/html/html-tag-history.html">only seem to have been part of the never officially adopted HTML 2.0 proposal</a>, and it exemplifies the academic nature of the early web. The <a href="http://www.martinrinehart.com/frontend-engineering/engineers/html/html-tag-history.html">HTML Tags: Past, Present, Proposed</a> page on martinrinehart.com defines <dfn title="Hyper Text Markup Language 2.0">HTML 2.0</dfn> as <q cite="http://www.martinrinehart.com/frontend-engineering/engineers/html/html-tag-history.html">There never was an HTML 2.0 standard, but these all shaped browser development in the late 20th century</q> with references to several RFC documents.</p>
<p><code>&lt;em&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> bring up similar usage questions as <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>, but in my opinion with even more nuance, especially, as the documentation notes, with other more specific tags like <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> that also by default italicize text in most browsers. The rule of thumb from above also for the most part fits here, <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> for single words, and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> for sentences or phrases, though the examples in the documentation seem to mostly use <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> for drawing attention to potential confusion, as in, <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em#i_vs._em">The word <i>the</i> is an article</q>.</p>
<p><code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> is another tag that makes me wonder about the conceptual boundaries of the usage of the tag. It is intended for specifying keys on a computer keyboard, for example: to type the <code>&lt;</code> character used for (the non escaped) version of the tags in this post, I press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd> (the styles here on <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> are applied through custom CSS). But I’m curious if it would also be appropriate to put a <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> around something like <i>Right click</i> (in this case I used <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> instead).</p>
<p><code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> is interesting because it suggests a 2-way authoring web that was originally envisioned, but failed to come to fruition, with usage notes like, <q>Think of this like using a <mark>highlighter pen</mark> in a book to mark passages that you find of interest.</q> The yellow here is the default style in all major browsers.</p>
<p><code>&lt;rp&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;rt&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;ruby&gt;</code> all relate to rendering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agate_(typography)">“ruby” or “agate” fonts</a>, which are the smallest legible text used in print. They are used in HTML to, <q>provide pronunciation, translation, or transliteration information for East Asian typography.</q> Because I don’t read any East Asian languages, I’ll use the same example as the MDN docs do below. Interestingly, <code>&lt;rp&gt;</code> is used to hide parentheses characters, which are included in the source. It’s surprising to me that there is an element to hide these characters in a very rare instance, but we still rely on CSS to <a href="https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/04/14/inclusively-hidden.html#hiding-content-visually">hide content visually</a> (but still show it to screen readers).</p>
<ruby>
漢 <rp>(</rp><rt>kan</rt><rp>)</rp>
字 <rp>(</rp><rt>ji</rt><rp>)</rp>
</ruby>
<p><code>&lt;s&gt;</code> is the strikethrough element, which should be used to indicate text that is not accurate or relevant, but was previously. Along with <code>&lt;menu&gt;</code> it is one of two elements (or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/u#usage_notes">according to MDN 3 with <code>&lt;u&gt;</code></a>) that were <a href="http://www.martinrinehart.com/frontend-engineering/engineers/html/html-tag-history.html">deprecated in HTML 4.01, and un-deprecated and redefined in HTML5</a>. The redefinition changes the use of the tag from presentational, which should now be achieved with CSS, to relevant to the context of the text. However, some screen readers don’t announce the strikethrough, which seems potentially confusing. I’ve added the CSS recommended by the MDN docs to my website, so the strikethrough should be announced here.</p>
<ul>
  <li><s>HTML 3.0: <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> is used for presentation</s></li>
  <li>HTML 5: <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> is used for removed text</li>
</ul>
<p><code>&lt;samp&gt;</code> is another element I wasn’t aware of before reading the MDN docs. It is used for rendering the output of a computer program, which I had previously just used <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> for (I just updated my <a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/blog/how-to-raspberry-pi-server/">Raspberry Pi blog post</a> to use <code>&lt;samp&gt;</code>). Another example is below:</p>
<figure>
<figcaption>A “Hello, World” program in JavaScript:</figcaption>
<code>
console.log("Hello, World")
</code>
<p>
<samp>
Hello, World
</samp></p></figure>
<p><code>&lt;small&gt;</code> is used to render smaller text, which is something I would usually have done with CSS. The MDN docs don’t provide much clarity about which strategy to use: <q>Authors are encouraged to use their best judgement when determining whether to use <code>&lt;small&gt;</code> or CSS.</q>. <small>I will probably continue to use CSS for the most part since the effect seems to be presentational for the most part.</small></p>
<p><code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is a very familiar element, but reading the documentation made me wonder for the first time why HTML and CSS allow contradictory element styles like a </p><p><code>&lt;div style="display: inline" /&gt;</code></p><p> or a <span><code>&lt;span style="display: block" /&gt;</code></span>. Though the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> breaks the parent <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, while the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> does not.</p>
<p><code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> (used for footnotes here) and <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> (used in the equation below) are more elements I probably have used the CSS implementations of previously (though it is appropriate for presentation only super or subscript.)</p>
<p><code>&lt;time&gt;</code> seems like a helpful element for creating semantic HTML, but even Google doesn’t seem to use it in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Patrick+Weaver%22+%22HTML%22">search results</a>. I’ve updated the dates on my blog posts to use it.</p>
<p><code>&lt;u&gt;</code> has probably my favorite quote from the MDN docs, <q>Most of the time, you actually don’t want to use <code>&lt;u&gt;</code>.</q> Their strongest recommendation seems to be indicating <u>spellling</u> errors.</p>
<p><code>&lt;var&gt;</code> is a way to indicate semantically that a string is a variable for either math or programming. For example, rendering the pythagorean theorem uses both <code>&lt;var&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code>: <var>a</var><sup>2</sup> + <var>b</var><sup>2</sup> = <var>c</var><sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p><code>&lt;wbr&gt;</code> was also a new element until now, but it solves a problem I have hit many times before, breaking long “words” at certain points, specifically URLs. If I put a <code>&lt;wbr&gt;</code> element at clear break points in this URL: <a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/pages/averylongurlwithoutanypunctuationbutstillmadeupofwords/">https://www.patrickweaver.net<wbr>/pages<wbr>/a<wbr>very<wbr>long<wbr>url<wbr>without<wbr>any<wbr>punctuation<wbr>but<wbr>still<wbr>made<wbr>up<wbr>of<wbr>words/</a> then it will break at clear points at different screen widths, which is is more readable compared to the same link without the <code>&lt;wbr&gt;</code> elements:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/pages/averylongurlwithoutanypunctuationbutstillmadeupofwords/">https://www.patrickweaver.net/pages/averylongurlwithoutanypunctuationbutstillmadeupofwords/</a></p>
<p>Though including hyphen characters in the URL also creates clear breakpoints in modern browsers. I did have to wrap the URL above in a special scrollable <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> to prevent it from breaking the layout of the rest of the page.</p>

<p><code>&lt;area&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;map&gt;</code> are elements that I hadn’t been familiar with previously, even though I had made a few image map type websites in the days before CSS 3. It seems like an indication of how seldom they are used these days that the tools for debugging the boundaries of <code>&lt;area&gt;</code> elements are hard to use. One <code>&lt;area&gt;</code> border at a time will display while using tab focus, but styling the elements does not work (unless there is a <code>display</code> hack I couldn’t figure out). It’s also somewhat strange that <code>&lt;area&gt;</code> is essentially an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> with a shape.</p>
<p>Here’s a <code>&lt;map&gt;</code> (with <code>&lt;area&gt;</code>s on each tag linking to MDN) of a handwritten HTML document I made for June 3rd’s <a href="https://html.energy/events.html">HTML Day Freewrite</a> in SF.</p>

<p><code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> is one of the classic multimedia HTML 5 tags so I’ve used it before, but thinking about it now, it’s surprising I don’t see them more often in the 2020s. I would guess that there are more in use than I thought, for example, the <a href="https://bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a> player uses a hidden <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element even though the UI is a custom mix of <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s inside a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> oddly enough.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>A recording of me reading the paragraph above. (Excuse my scratchy late night voice)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><code>&lt;img&gt;</code> is of course one of the first elements I used, but I was curious what properties could be used with it that I might not have heard of. <code>srcset</code>, used for specifying multiple sizes of the same image to load at different screen resolutions, was one of those. I’ve created a demo below, which goes against the spirit of <code>srcset</code>.</p>
<p>The image below has 3 images provided to its <code>srcset</code> property:</p>
<ol>
<li>A yellow background and a monospace font that is 300 pixels wide and should render when the page is less than 520 pixels wide</li>
<li>A blue background and a serifed font that should render when the page is between 520 and 800 pixels wide</li>
<li>A green background and a script font that should render when the page is greater than 800 pixels wide.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://www.patrickweaver.net/images/blog/html/srcset-700.png" srcset="https://www.patrickweaver.net/images/blog/html/srcset-300.png 300w, https://www.patrickweaver.net/images/blog/html/srcset-500.png 500w, https://www.patrickweaver.net/images/blog/html/srcset-700.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 300px, (max-width: 800px) 500px, 700px" alt="A demo of the srcset property of the HTML <img> tag that loads different images at different sizes" id="image-with-srcset"></p>
<p>I have tested it, and it does work, but it takes a lot of forethought to make sure that you will be able to load the correct image. Things like the browser’s cache, and scaled displays will change the behavior. If you want to see the effect you will probably need to load the page in a private window on a non scaled or “retina” display.</p>
<p>It’s interesting that while both <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> are less widely used than <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> even after their introduction in HTML 5, the distribution of videos online seems to be centralized, mostly on YouTube, while audio is more decentralized, with people serving individual files when distributing things like podcasts, even though the audio player that is often used is not on the web.</p>

</figure>
<p>One reason for this may be that there are still some quirks with <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements. For example, there is a <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> accompanying the video above, but when I initially tried creating the element with a self closing tag it did not render. Also, as I’m writing this, Safari does not support the video at all, likely because of the development server I am using not supporting the “Range” request header. I am curious to find out whether the hosted version of the site (on GitHub pages) will support playing the video in Safari. I thought that I might have a similar issue with <code>&lt;track&gt;</code>, but that just turned out to be me not setting up my <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> build correctly for <code>.vtt</code> files.</p>

<p>It is somewhat surprising that <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> have not been deprecated since most of their uses have been superseded by specific tags like <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>. Maybe eventually they will be, or they will just live on in the name of backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>Speaking of <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> it’s also interesting that the very 90s name “iframe” (“inline frame”, not “iPod Frame” or something, and I was surprised to learn does render <code>display: inline</code>) has survived while <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code> was deprecated in HTML 5. I thought that <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> might be a way to force the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> <code>srcset</code> example above to render the smaller images on a high DPI display, but even at 150px wide on my device the large image still renders:</p>
<figure>

</figcaption></figure>
<p><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> is a tag that is, with <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> actually intended for layout tricks like the <code>srcset</code> experiment I tried above, rendering different versions of an image in different situations. The image below should show an icon of a computer when used with a mouse/trackpad, or an icon of a phone when used with a touch screen (using the <code>pointer</code> media query to determine), and should fall back to an image of a red circle with a line through it when neither media query is appropriate. The responsive design developer tools in your browser should trick it, though interestingly, not when inspecting an element.</p>

<p><code>&lt;portal&gt;</code> is one of the more mysterious sounding elements, and seems intended for the iPad-style link previews that I’ve seen implemented on some websites on hover, <a href="https://web.dev/hands-on-portals/">but also come with SPA-like performance benefits</a>. It unfortunately is still an experimental feature and isn’t (as of 2023) enabled by default in any browsers. It seems that it <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/portals-in-chrome-going-on-a-test-drive-66b16971fb19">used to be an available experimental flag in Chrome</a>, but today in 2023 it is not available at <a href="chrome://flags">chrome://flags</a>. I’ll include one below in case it works for future readers! I did try it in an very old Chromium version I still had installed. <code>&lt;portal&gt;</code> doesn’t seem to be part of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/">HTML 5 Spec</a>, I’m not sure why it’s included in the MDN documentation.</p>

</ul>
<p>This is an interesting section of the documentation because it pairs one of the most ubiquitous elements with one of the most obscure. <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> elements are everywhere, especially that tools like Figma and Sketch have made them easy to prototype and export. Pairing them with <code>&lt;math&gt;</code> in the documentation evokes a more artisanal, hand-crafted <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> that is relatively uncommon these days. I’ve gone hand-crafted here and drawn some <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> circles.</p>
<figure>
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke="white" fill="white" width="200"><circle cx="50" cy="50" r="49" fill="red"></circle><circle cx="47" cy="50" r="42" fill="orange"></circle><circle cx="50" cy="53" r="35" fill="yellow"></circle><circle cx="55" cy="52" r="28" fill="green"></circle><circle cx="52" cy="48" r="21" fill="indigo"></circle><circle cx="54" cy="50" r="14" fill="blue"></circle><circle cx="52" cy="55" r="7" fill="violet"></circle></svg>

<p><code>&lt;math&gt;</code> is really a wrapper element for other non HTML elements from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/" target="_blank">MathML</a> namespace, so I guess I don’t have to include every possible child element here. I’ll stick to something simple: <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>5</mn></mrow></math>

</ul>
<p>I did a deep dive into <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, specifically <a href="https://doodles.patrickweaver.net/canvas-lines/">drawing crisp lines</a> in 2020 while I was at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>. One thing I wasn’t familiar with before reading the MDN docs though, was that there is a maximum size for a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element in each browser (though all modern browsers it is about 32 thousand pixels in each dimension). Below is a re-implementation of <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> (and <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code>).</p>

<p><label for="toggleMarqueeButton">Start or Stop the fake <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code>:</label>
</p>


<p>There were a lot of tags that I expected to feel a little out of date when I started this post, but <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> wasn’t one of them, but now that I have written most of the post, and have created a few <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags, I’m realizing how little I use them now. For most of the code that I write, even though most of it is JavaScript, all of the “scripting” gets put into on <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag by build tools and it ends up feeling more like boilerplate than a “markup” tag.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for most of the interactive websites I’ve made, I’ve rarely included a <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tag with the exception of those minified and compiled single page apps where the user would likely get a blank page if it weren’t for the <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tag (and even then, probably less often than I should have, though I’ve made sure to include one with every <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag here).</p>

<p>It’s not a new insight that <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> elements were overused for layout purposes on the early web, but an irony that I’m only realizing now is that recently, as the web has gotten more and more populated by data, that <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> elements have become rarely used, probably mostly due to their clunky default design, but probably also because one main goal of creating a web UI for the data that is otherwise probably stored in database tables, is to create a <i>different</i> view of the same data.</p>
<p>I don’t have any tabular data as this is an exclusively <em>document</em> based blog post, but below I’ve added a table with some custom CSS and “data” on emoji that is likely only accurate for the Apple emoji set in 2023. I wasn’t familiar with <code>&lt;col&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;colgroup&gt;</code> before, but I don’t know that there are many cases where I would use them rather than a more custom, non <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> design.</p>

<h3>Interactive Elements</h3>

<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog"><code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary"><code>&lt;summary&gt;</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> combination is probably the most common, “You don’t need JavaScript to…” element (another <a href="https://catskull.net/html.html" target="_blank">popular blog</a> post making this point prompted me to finally finish this one). Making this kind of expand/collapse interactive view was one of the first things I used JavaScript for (it was probably jQuery). I remember it being somewhat confusing at the time (2006?), so it’s funny to me to see it so easy with just a couple HTML tags.</p>
<details>
  <summary>Speculation about <code>&lt;details&gt;</code></summary>
  <p>I do wonder if <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> were being considered for the HTML spec today, if they would be withdrawn in favor of a similar effect using CSS.</p>
</details>
<p>I wasn’t aware of the HTML only <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> before using it here. It requires JavaScript to be useful beyond just its stylistic impact, but it’s an interesting way to create interactions that are more custom than <code>alert()</code>, but still simple, because while <code>alert()</code> is styled by the browser <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> can be styled with CSS.</p>

<h3>Web Components</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot"><code>&lt;slot&gt;</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template"><code>&lt;template&gt;</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Web components had been on a (long) list of “things I should learn more about” for a while, so I was glad to get to this section of the MDN documentation. I was surprised that JavaScript (and <code>Class</code> syntax at that) was necessary to get web components to render, but after reading more about the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM">Shadow DOM</a>, it makes sense, because HTML has no built in way to encapsulate styles, though it does seem to be somewhat similar conceptually to <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> elements.</p>
<p>I’ve used web components below to create a table of contents for this post below, though I’m not making the best use of them. One thing I couldn’t quickly figure out how to do, when compared to components from frontend frameworks, is pass in properties that are themselves used as properties of elements in the child template, so in the list below I have to pass a full <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element into each child (which renders the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>), to be able to set the correct <code>href</code> property. Someday after finishing this post I will read more about web components and maybe figure out something I’m missing now.</p>

<p>There are of course a few <big>deprecated</big> <acronym title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</acronym> elements, so why not <span color="#2FCF6F" face="times" size="5">include</span> them here at the end.</p>
<p>Everyone’s favorite is of course,</p>
<center><code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code></center>
<p><marquee>Hello!</marquee></p>
<p>Many of the elements, like <code>&lt;big&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;acronym&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> (used above), <code>&lt;nobr&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;strike&gt;</code> are examples of layout related functionality that has been moved to CSS rather than <strike>have HTML handle it</strike>. The narrow box below has an example of <code>&lt;nobr&gt;</code>:</p>
<div id="nobr-box">
    <nobr>This sentence is wrapped in a <code>&lt;nobr&gt;</code>.</nobr>
    <p>This sentence is wrapped in a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.</p>
    <p>This sentence is wrapped in a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> with <code>style="white-space: nowrap;"</code>.</p>
</div>
<p>There are some other strange ones as well though. I couldn’t implement <code>&lt;content&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;shadow&gt;</code> here because they were never fully implemented part of the web components spec. I’ll add some below anyway though.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><code>&lt;shadow&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;content&gt;</code> elements (that won’t render).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And <code>&lt;dir&gt;</code> is a very <i>webserver</i> version of <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> for listing directories. Since my Eleventy static site generator does use directories here’s a list:</p>
<dir>
    <li><a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/blog">/blog</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/css">/css</a></li>

    <li><a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/pages">/pages</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/portfolio">/portfolio</a></li>
</dir>
<p>Some of deprecated elements won’t render without some extra work, for example <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;frameset&gt;</code> are designed to be used instead of a <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, for I guess some kind of collage web page made up of other pages. I’ve ironically only been able to use them inside of an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> below.</p>
<figure>

</figcaption></figure>
<p>I expected that <code>&lt;image&gt;</code> wouldn’t work since the MDN documentation says:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/image">
    This does not appear to have been part of any formal specification. It was mentioned in HTML+ Discussion Document - Dave Raggett, November 8, 1993 (Section 5.9 - Images), but was not part of the first revision of HyperText Markup Language Specification - 2.0 in 1994.
</blockquote>
<p>But it does seem to work in some browsers in 2023, though this might be just a fallback for potential confusion with <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.patrickweaver.net/images/blog/html/fax.png" width="100">An icon of a fax machine</p>
<p>One of the more interesting browser compatibility stories of the deprecated elements is <code>&lt;menuitem&gt;</code>, which supposedly was <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=menuitem">partially supported in Firefox versions 8 - 84</a>, but I couldn’t get <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_menuitem">an example</a> to work in any of the older versions I installed locally (even with editing <code>about:config</code>). The examples imply that the <code>&lt;menu&gt;</code> (of <code>type=context</code>) and child <code>&lt;menuitem&gt;</code> elements shouldn’t render until the element whose <code>contextmenu</code> property is right clicked, but as you can see below, the items always render:</p>


<p>It’s surprising that <code>&lt;noembed&gt;</code>, essentially a <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> style fallback, was deprecated while <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> was kept in the spec. Here’s my <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> from above, but this time with a <code>&lt;noembed&gt;</code> child. There is also <code>&lt;noframes&gt;</code> which I included above with the <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code> element.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>An <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> with a <code>&lt;noembed&gt;</code> tag child.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It’s unclear why <code>&lt;param&gt;</code> ever existed instead of just using attributes on the <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> element. When I started this blog post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220330125752/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">it was listed in the “Embedding Content” section</a>, but by the time I finished it was deprecated. Here is one below:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>An <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> with a <code>&lt;param&gt;</code> tag child.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><code>&lt;plaintext&gt;</code> is another weird one, and notable among the deprecated elements in that it works. It is another one I am going to have to wrap in an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> because otherwise the rest of the page would be rendered as the source code:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>An embed of a <a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/pages/plaintext-element/" target="_blank">page</a> with a <code>&lt;plaintext&gt;</code> element.
</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, <code>&lt;xmp&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;tt&gt;</code>, used in a similar way, have closing tags </p><xmp><span id="xmp-element">
so they can be used here for displaying source code
</span></xmp> or text in a monospace font<tt>
<span id="tt-element">as it would be shown on a teletype</span>
</tt> without an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>.
<p>A few of the deprecated elements have just been replaced by newer additions to the spec. <code>&lt;rb&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;rtc&gt;</code> were used for displaying pronunciation of East Asian characters, but it seems like the spec was simplified. Here is the example from MDN:</p>
<p><ruby xml:lang="zh-Hant"><rbc><rb>馬</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>mǎ</rt><rp>)</rp><rb>來</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>lái</rt><rp>)</rp><rb>西</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>xī</rt><rp>)</rp><rb>亞</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>yà</rt><rp>)</rp></rbc><rtc xml:lang="en"><rp>(</rp><rt>Malaysia</rt><rp>)</rp></rtc></ruby></p>
</section>
<section id="other-elements">
<h3>Other Elements</h3>
<p>I consulted a few other lists of HTML tags after realizing that the <code>&lt;!-- comment --&gt;</code> tag wasn’t in my list from MDN (there’s one below this paragraph)</p>
<!-- The only reference to HTML comments on MDN seems to be in the web APIs section: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Comment -->
<p>An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520111045/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element" target="_blank">older list from MDN in 2013</a> has elements like <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code>, and for accessibility reasons, <q cite="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520111045/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">almost all browsers currently ignore this element.</q> I’ll add one hidden below if you can find a very old browser that supports it:</p>


<p>Also on the list is <code>&lt;spacer&gt;</code>, which doesn’t work in modern browsers and,</p>

<p>would now be done</p>

<p>with CSS.</p>
<p>Then there’s others like <code>&lt;bgsound&gt;</code> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004002320/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/bgsound" target="_blank">2013 docs</a>) that seems to have never been implemented (except maybe in Netscape?), but alludes to a vision for a much more <em>multimedia</em> enabled web documents, and <code>&lt;isindex&gt;</code> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130916195848/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/isindex" target="_blank">2013 docs</a>) which seems like it is from a world where JavaScript doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Another attempt at <code>&lt;xmp&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tt&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> was</p>
<listing><span id="listing-child">listing</span></listing>
<p>I’m surprised it seems to still work!</p>
<p>And of course <code>&lt;applet&gt;</code>, but I’m not even going to try with that one.</p>

    <p>Listening to Daft Punk every now and then is a never aging event for me. Their albums have a variety of musical diversity, and you can always enjoy their fairly repetitive songs on boring household activities. ‘One more time, we’re gonna celebrateh! Oh yeah, Don’t stop the washing!’ Well, one of the most influential electronic duos of the millennium had plenty of tricks in their bag to put into their music. Today, I will try to introduce three of them with examples.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-psychoacoustics">
  What is Psychoacoustics?
  <a href="#what-is-psychoacoustics">
    
    <span>Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>Psychoacoustics is an area that includes sound perception and audiology. The area studies psychological responses to auditory events, and the field is as extensive as acoustics, psychology, sound and electronic engineering, physics, and biology. The human auditory system is a complex system that starts from our pinna (your visible ear) and continues to the ear canal, membrane, auditory ossicles, cochlea, lateral superior olive, and medial superior olivary and travels in your brain to hear what is vibrating over the air. Everything we experience has a processing time of milliseconds. Perhaps that shows how fast and strong the human brain is. Although we have such a capable auditory system, scientists have shown that our perception may play some tricks when it comes to audio recognition. And by that, I don’t mean the physical mechanism but psychologically induced ones. Those findings show that hearing is also cultural; different cultures may hear differently.</p>
<h3 id="continuity-effect--phonemic-restoration-effect">
  Continuity Effect &amp; Phonemic restoration effect
  <a href="#continuity-effect--phonemic-restoration-effect">
    
    <span>Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>If a sound is interrupted by a noise with enough loudness in a short interval, we tend to hear the sound continuously. One can create gaps less than 200ms in a tone and fill those gaps with a particular noise which will hide the gaps for you. The shortness of duration combined with the noise, our brains tend to hear a continuous sound signal. Phonemic restoration slightly differs from the continuity effect. This time our brain “fills” the gaps of missing sounds. Our brain acts meddlesome in favor of increased intelligibility, even though the sound lacks information. We observe this phenomenon in the popular Daft Punk song: “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.” If you start listening around 2:20, you will experience the various cuts. (most noticeable around 2:50)</p>

  The Octave Illusion (Deutsch’s Octave Illusion)
  <a href="#the-octave-illusion-deutschs-octave-illusion">
    
    <span>Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>The Octave Illusion is one of the most interesting psychoacoustic illusions, first discovered by Diana Deutsch in 1973. The illusion works as follows: Two tones, one with higher and one with lower pitch, play in our ears in an alternating fashion visualized as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ugu.rs/images/alternating.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There is one octave between the tones. If the alternation is short enough, you will hear the higher tone in one ear and the lower in the other. Your handedness plays a role here. Right-handed people tend to hear the higher pitch in the right ear. If you are left-handed or ambidexter your perception may vary. For this illusion, our example comes from the Discovery album. Open the song Aerodynamic and fast-forward to 2:28, start listening to the passage. I hear the higher pitch on my right and the lower one on my left ear. What about you?</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L93-7vRfxNs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<h3 id="talking-piano">
  Talking Piano
  <a href="#talking-piano">
    
    <span>Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>This effect is the art of making the piano (or another instrument) speak! There are a number of examples of it, where people approximate human speech by converting it into fundamental frequencies and then playing the piano notes to reconstruct the atomic structures of speech. An interesting example you can find is <a href="https://ablinger.mur.at/docu11.html">here</a>. Even though the effect is named a talking piano, other instruments can speak as well. In their song “Robot Rock”, you can hear the guitar chords talking, as if they are singing the lyrics, ehm, Robot Rock!</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">
  Conclusion
  <a href="#conclusion">
    
    <span>Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>There are more than three auditory illusions to present (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVsMiSrlSSc">maybe more than 40</a>) and Daft Punk may have created songs including those illusions. It is evident that hearing is not just physical but also psychological. Speaking of psychology, does anyone know how do our feelings connect to music? Listening to Instant Crush, Veridis Quo, or Something About Us, you will most likely fall into a brown study. That is a phenomenon I can’t explain myself either.</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>

One of the kids said the water “smelled like doo-doo,” said Acosta, who is an architect and environmental activist.</p><p>“The kid was right, because that’s exactly what it is,” he said.</p><p>The sewer water in Parque Baja California is a microcosm of Tijuana’s failing infrastructure — an ongoing crisis with grave impacts on economies, quality of life and public health on both sides of the border.</p><p>Cross-border sewage is among the most critical issues facing the Tijuana-San Diego region. On the U.S. side, the problem is particularly acute in San Diego’s South Bay. The Environmental Protection Agency has <a href="https://www.kpbs.org/news/environment/2023/01/30/federal-funding-approved-to-fix-san-diegos-cross-border-pollution-problem" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"><u>a $630 million blueprint</u></a> for eliminating 95% of the contaminated cross-border flows.</p><p>While funding remains a question mark, the federal appropriations bill signed last December cleared the way for the EPA to transfer $300 million to the International Boundary and Water Commission for infrastructure projects.</p><p>The main sources of cross-border sewage are overburdened sewage treatment facilities prone to leaks and runoff from the Tijuana River after heavy rains.</p><p>Then there’s the type of contamination found at Parque Baja California. It doesn’t receive nearly as much attention as the other two, but it is in many respects the most difficult to control.</p><p>“People connect their sewer lines to the storm drain and we end up with wastewater running through those storm drain pipes,” said Carmen Romo, an environmental activist with the group Tijuana Calidad de Vida.</p><h3>A problem in plain sight</h3><p>It’s common to see — and smell — brown liquid coming from the city’s storm drain pipes. Even when it isn’t raining, Romo said. Much of that waste from homes and businesses flows directly into the Pacific Ocean and has contributed to Imperial Beach’s coastline being closed for 500 consecutive days over the past two years.</p><p>The problem is in plain sight in the Playas de Tijuana neighborhood, where dozens of storm drain pipes empty into the ocean. These pipes should be dry when it isn’t raining, but flow year-round.</p><p>“This is something that happens on a regular basis,” Romo said. “And through the coast, if you walk along, you’ll see several storm drains just pouring out sewage.”</p><p>Within the city, it is the poorest residents who are most impacted. In the Los Laureles neighborhood of Tijuana, trash and other debris block storm drain pipes leading to the Tijuana River. The result is pools of wastewater in the middle of residential neighborhoods.</p><p>This contamination exposes residents to a host of health problems, according to Rosario Zagarai, an activist with WildCoast. “They get skin infections, respiratory illnesses and gastrointestinal viruses,” she said.</p><p>Zagarai, Romo and other activists blame the lax regulatory environment. Part of the reason nothing gets done, they said, is that Tijuana runs the storm drain system while the state of Baja California manages the sewage system.</p><p>Whenever someone complains, the two governments point fingers at each other and nothing gets done, Romo said.</p><p>“It gets kind of complicated,” she said.</p><p>Consider that the state will only connect homes to the sewage system if property owners have official deeds. However, an estimated 40% of new construction in Tijuana is built without permits, which means the flow of sewage will continue to increase into the foreseeable future.</p><p>The Baja California state agency tasked with managing the wastewater system did not respond to questions. Tijuana officials, meanwhile, told KPBS they’re doing their part.</p><p>“We report each instance to the state agency and they inspect them,” said Juan Enrique Bautista Corona, director of Tijuana’s Urban Development Department.</p><div data-align-center="">

</div><h3>Drains packed with trash</h3><p>Bautista Corona said city workers have collected 6,000 tons of trash from storm drains over the last three years through a program that specifically targets big items like couches and refrigerators, he said.</p><p>The city has also launched public awareness campaigns to stop the public from dumping trash into the drains.</p><p>Conflicts between state and local governments are an old story in Mexico, according to Juan Manuel Rodriguez Esteves, a professor at El Colegio de la Frontera Norte.</p><p>“Both sides say the other isn’t doing enough,” he said.</p><p>He agrees lack of government action contributes to the problem, but Rodriguez Esteves believes some of the responsibility also falls on Tijuana’s residents. They have to take some responsibility for the illegal construction and trash dumping, he said.</p><p>“I don’t have a magical solution for this,” Rodriguez Esteves said. “There has to be communication between the city and state, communities have to organize themselves.”</p><p>A long-term solution requires sustained investment of millions of dollars into identifying every illegal connection and correcting it; as well as public awareness campaigns preventing new illegal connections, he said.</p><p>But Baja California’s political environment is a major obstacle to long-term plans because incoming mayoral and gubernatorial administrations rarely complete their predecessor’s projects.</p><p>“We start over every three years,” he said.</p>
