                    <p>Despite their misleading marketing, TeleMessage, the company that makes a modified version of Signal used by senior Trump officials, can access plaintext chat logs from its customers.</p><p>In this post I give a high level overview of how the TeleMessage fake Signal app, called TM SGNL, works and why it's so insecure. Then I give a thorough analysis of the source code for TM SGNL's Android app, and what led me to conclude that TeleMessage can access plaintext chat logs. Finally, I back up my analysis with as-of-yet unpublished details about the <a href="https://micahflee.com/the-signal-clone-the-trump-admin-uses-was-hacked/" rel="noreferrer">hack</a> of TeleMessage.</p><p>But first, here's a quick timeline of events.</p><ul><li>On Thursday, 404 Media <a href="https://www.404media.co/mike-waltz-accidentally-reveals-obscure-app-the-government-is-using-to-archive-signal-messages/" rel="noreferrer">reported</a> that in the Reuters <a href="https://www.reutersconnect.com/item/us-national-security-advisor-mike-waltz-attends-a-cabinet-meeting-held-by-president-trump-at-the-white-house-in-washington/dGFnOnJldXRlcnMuY29tLDIwMjU6bmV3c21sX1JDMkg4RUFEOEtGRw%3D%3D?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">photo</a> showing former National Security Advisor and <a href="https://zeteo.com/p/signal-chat-war-crimes-revealed-yemen-trump-admin" rel="noreferrer">war criminal</a> Mike Waltz checking his Signal messages under the table, he was actually using an obscure modified Signal app called TM SGNL, and not the real and actually secure Signal app.</li><li>On Friday, I wrote <a href="https://micahflee.com/tm-sgnl-the-obscure-unofficial-signal-app-mike-waltz-uses-to-text-with-trump-officials/" rel="noreferrer">an analysis</a> of everything I could find out about TM SGNL using OSINT, including the fact that it's nearly impossible to install without a device enrolled in an MDM service that's tied to an Apple Business Manager or a Google Enterprise account.</li><li>On Saturday, after <a href="https://todon.eu/@ljrk/114444796069542288" rel="noreferrer">discovering</a> that TeleMessage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250503004419/https://www.telemessage.com/developer/api-libraries/" rel="noreferrer">published</a> the source code for the TM SGNL apps for Android and iPhone themselves, I <a href="https://micahflee.com/heres-the-source-code-for-the-unofficial-signal-app-used-by-trump-officials/" rel="noreferrer">re-published them</a> on GitHub with the goal of making them easier to research.

The modified Signal app is almost entirely identical to the authentic version of Signal, except it also archives copies of every message to a destination determined by the TeleMessage customer. (Presumably, WhatsApp, Telegram, and WeChat work in the same way, but I have only analyzed the TM SGNL for Android source code.)</p><h3 id="the-tm-sgnl-app">The TM SGNL app</h3><p>TM SGNL is interoperable with Signal. When a TM SGNL user registers a new account, they're registering it with the official Signal server. TM SGNL users can send messages to Signal users and visa versa. If you're a Signal user, you have no way of knowing when you're talking to a TM SGNL user, because the apps are nearly identical and use the same infrastructure.</p><p>This is how Mike Waltz could accidentally add The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a group chat where they discussed <a href="https://zeteo.com/p/signal-chat-war-crimes-revealed-yemen-trump-admin" rel="noreferrer">bombing an apartment building full of civilians</a>: Waltz was presumably using TM SGNL, and Goldberg was presumably using Signal.</p><p>Note that we don't know how long Trump officials have been using TM SGNL. It's possible they've been using it since around Trump's inauguration on January 20. If this is the case, the chat logs for the Signal group where Waltz invited Goldberg will have been collected by TeleMessage. But it's also possible that they only started using TM SGNL <em>after</em> Signalgate, maybe as a way to attempt to start complying with record keeping laws. So far, we don't know the timeline. This would be good to get to the bottom of to understand what laws they have already broken.</p><p>Anyway, on Mike Waltz's phone – and quite likely, the phones of Pete Hegseth, Marco Rubio, Tulsi Gabbard, JD Vance, and many others, possibly even including Donald Trump – the TM SGNL app basically works like this:</p><ul><li>Every message the TM SGNL app sees gets stored in a SQLite database with a <code>status</code> column set to <code>WaitingToBeDelivered</code>.</li><li>TM SGNL registers with the phone's background syncing service. On a regular basis, the app runs some sync code that selects messages that are <code>WaitingToBeDelivered</code>. If there are any, it delivers them to TeleMessage's archive server at <code>https://archive.telemessage.com</code>, and updates their status to <code>Sent</code>.</li></ul><h3 id="telemessages-archive-server">TeleMessage's archive server</h3><p>As I discussed in <a href="https://micahflee.com/tm-sgnl-the-obscure-unofficial-signal-app-mike-waltz-uses-to-text-with-trump-officials/" rel="noreferrer">my initial OSINT analysis</a>, according to this documentation <a href="https://micahflee.com/content/files/2025/05/Capture-Mobile--TeleMessage-_Signal-Capture_20250502.pdf" rel="noreferrer">PDF</a>, the admins for organizations that use TeleMessage set up archive plans and assign users to them.</p><figure><img src="https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/05/Screenshot-From-2025-05-02-13-09-10-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1795" height="771" srcset="https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/Screenshot-From-2025-05-02-13-09-10-1.png 600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/Screenshot-From-2025-05-02-13-09-10-1.png 1000w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/Screenshot-From-2025-05-02-13-09-10-1.png 1600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/05/Screenshot-From-2025-05-02-13-09-10-1.png 1795w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption><span>How TM SNGL archive plans work, on page 22 of the documentation PDF</span></figcaption></figure><p>Each archive plan has a source messaging app (like TM SGNL) and a destination, which is controlled by the TeleMessage customer. Destinations can include Microsoft 365, email servers (SMTP), or file servers (SFTP). The admin assigns TeleMessage users – like Mike Waltz –  to an archive plan, which determines where their chat logs will get archived.</p><p>Once the TM SGNL app sends chat logs to the archive server, the archive server is supposed to do something like this: It looks up the user that sent the chat log, then looks up that user's archive plan, then forwards the messages to destination defined in the archive plan (via SMTP or SFTP), and presumably (but who really knows for sure) deletes the chat logs from the archive server.</p><p>Here's a diagram of how the whole system appears to work:</p><figure><img src="https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/05/TM-SGNL-diagram-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="825" srcset="https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/TM-SGNL-diagram-2.png 600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/TM-SGNL-diagram-2.png 1000w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/05/TM-SGNL-diagram-2.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Diagram of how TeleMessage archives Signal messages, based on my analysis of the source code</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id="microsoft-365">Microsoft 365</h3><p>The archive server appears to connect directly to SMTP and SFTP destinations to push chat logs. However, according to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/archive-signal-archiver-data" rel="noreferrer">Microsoft's documentation</a>, Microsoft 365 works the opposite way: Microsoft 365 logs into the archive server and pulls the chat logs once a day. Their docs state:</p><blockquote>The Signal Archiver connector that you create in the Microsoft Purview portal connects to the TeleMessage site every day and transfers the email messages from the previous 24 hours to a secure Azure Storage area in the Microsoft Cloud.</blockquote><p>They even published their own diagram explaining how it works:</p><figure><img src="https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/05/signalconnectorworkflow.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="748" height="457" srcset="https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/signalconnectorworkflow.png 600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/05/signalconnectorworkflow.png 748w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Using a connector to archive Signal communication data in Microsoft 365, from Microsoft's documentation</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id="why-this-is-so-terribly-insecure">Why this is so terribly insecure</h3><p>Signal is the gold standard of end-to-end encrypted messaging apps.</p><p>Messages are encrypted between endpoints – whether that's a phone running Signal, a computer running Signal Desktop, or even a phone running TM SGNL. The Signal server, and any internet eavesdroppers, cannot access the chat logs.</p><p>However, once they're at an endpoint, they are in plaintext (if they weren't, you wouldn't be able to read your texts). At this point, they're protected by various forms of disk encryption depending on the device. This is how Signal messages sometimes end up as evidence in court records: someone's phone or laptop with Signal installed was searched, after the messages were already decrypted.</p><p><strong>TM SGNL <em>completely breaks this security</em>. The communication between the TM SGNL app and the final archive destination <em>is not end-to-end encrypted</em>.</strong></p><p>TeleMessage lies about this in their marketing material, claiming that TM SGNL supports "End-to-End encryption from the mobile phone through to the corporate archive."</p><p>Here's a screenshot from an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250501200805/https://www.telemessage.com/mobile-archiver/signal-archiver/" rel="noreferrer">archived version</a> of their site (since they've taken down all of the content):</p><figure><img src="https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/05/Screenshot-From-2025-05-05-20-22-08.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1637" height="1239" srcset="https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/Screenshot-From-2025-05-05-20-22-08.png 600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/Screenshot-From-2025-05-05-20-22-08.png 1000w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/Screenshot-From-2025-05-05-20-22-08.png 1600w, https://micahflee.com/content/images/2025/05/Screenshot-From-2025-05-05-20-22-08.png 1637w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>TeleMessage falsely claims that TM SGNL supports "End-to-End encryption from the mobile phone through to the corporate archive"</span></figcaption></figure><p>Instead, TM SGNL sends the plaintext, already decrypted versions of chat logs to the archive server. (There might be some encryption involved some of the time, which I go over the "Corroborative evidence from the hack" section at the bottom.)</p><p>The archive server then forwards these to the destination.</p><p>Anyway, after TM SGNL decrypts messages, it sends the plaintext chat logs to TeleMessage's archive server. <strong>At this point, a lot of people might have access to the chat logs.</strong></p><p>The archive server was hosted in the public AWS cloud in their data center in Northern Virginia. This is not an approved place to store classified information, and potentially rogue AWS employees could have had access. This server was open to the public – anyone in the world could send HTTP requests to it to try to get chat logs back in a response. On Saturday, <a href="https://micahflee.com/the-signal-clone-the-trump-admin-uses-was-hacked/" rel="noreferrer">one of those people did</a>.</p><p>I'm saying the server "was" hosted in AWS because TeleMessage <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/telemessage-suspends-services-hackers-say-breached-app-rcna204925" rel="noreferrer">took down</a> their archive server shortly after we published the story about the hack. As of this writing, their archive server is offline.</p><p>TeleMessage also might be sharing chat logs with Israeli intelligence.</p><p>TeleMessage is an Israeli company. It was founded in 1999 by Guy Levit, the same year he left his job in the Israel Defense Force where he "served as the head of the planning and development of one of the IDF’s Intelligence elite technical units," according to his bio on the TeleMessage website (they have since taken all the content off their website).</p><p>Levit, and others at his firm, have access to the archive server and all of the chat logs it contains. I don't know what Israel's version of the Patriot Act is like, but I do know that it would be trivial for TeleMessage to add a bit of code that forwards a copy of everything to Israeli intelligence – far simpler than it was to add code to Signal to forward a copy to themselves.</p><p>To be clear, there's no evidence yet that TeleMessage is sharing chat logs with the Israeli government. <strong>But the fact that they designed their archiving system to <em>not be end-to-end encrypted</em>, and that they lie about it, is quite a big red flag.</strong></p><p>This is the app that Mike Waltz uses. While we don't really know the timeline, it's possible that everyone in the 19-person Signalgate group, where they discussed bombing Yemen, were also using this app same app. These include JD Vance, John Ratcliffe, Marco Rubio, Pete Hegseth, Stephen Miller, Tulsi Gabbard, and others. It's plausible that Israeli intelligence has been reading the internal chat logs of the most powerful members of Trump's authoritarian government.</p><h2 id="analysis-of-the-tm-sgnl-android-source-code">Analysis of the TM SGNL Android source code</h2><p>I've only analyzed the the <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/TM-SGNL-Android" rel="noreferrer">TM SGNL Android source code</a>, not the <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/TM-SGNL-iOS" rel="noreferrer">iPhone source code</a>. I'm assuming that the iPhone app works in the same way as the Android app, and anything that I learn from analyzing the Android app is applicable to the iPhone app as well.</p><p>I've focused on Android because it's much easier to reverse engineer Android apps than iPhone apps. There are excellent tools available for analyzing Android apps, like <a href="https://apktool.org/" rel="noreferrer">apktool</a>, <a href="https://github.com/EFForg/apkeep" rel="noreferrer">apkeep</a>, and even the official <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio" rel="noreferrer">Android Studio</a>. Furthermore, Android apps are programmed in Java and Kotlin (which both compile to Java bytecode), and it's easy to decompile Java bytecode, turning it back into human readable source code, and making it so much easier to work with.</p><p>Also, while TeleMessage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250503004419/https://www.telemessage.com/developer/api-libraries/" rel="noreferrer">posted links</a> to ZIP files claiming to be contain the Android and iOS source code on their website, the iOS version <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/TM-SGNL-iOS/issues/1" rel="noreferrer">appears</a> to actually be the source code for Signal for iOS itself, without any extra TeleMessage code added.</p><div><p>💡</p><p>As you can see in the <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/TM-SGNL-Android/blob/libs/LICENSE" rel="noreferrer">LICENSE</a> file included with the source code, TM SGNL is licensed under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. This gives me, and everyone else, the unlimited right to access, analyze, reverse engineer, and pretty much do anything else we wish to with the code, so long as we release any derivative works under the same license.</p></div><p>I've only had a few days to look at this code so far – and I paused work on analyzing it so I could break the story about TeleMessage getting hacked – so there's a lot that I still don't fully understand.

Now I'm going to tie it all together from the beginning, the <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/TM-SGNL-Android/blob/libs/app/src/tm/java/org/tm/archive/TeleMessageSignalApplication.kt" rel="noreferrer"><code>TeleMessageSignalApplication</code></a> object, which is created when the app is created.</p><p>Here's the <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/TM-SGNL-Android/blob/libs/app/src/tm/java/org/tm/archive/TeleMessageSignalApplication.kt#L37-L44" rel="noreferrer"><code>onCreate</code></a> method, which is called when the app starts:</p><pre><code>override fun onCreate() {
  super.onCreate()
  Log.createInstance(applicationContext)
  ArchiveLogger.sendArchiveLog("TeleMessage logger created")

  initializeSdk()
  initArchiveUrlsAndStartArchive()
}</code></pre><p>This runs <code>initializeSdk</code>, followed by <code>initArchiveUrlsAndStartArchive</code>. Here's <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/TM-SGNL-Android/blob/libs/app/src/tm/java/org/tm/archive/TeleMessageSignalApplication.kt#L67-L73" rel="noreferrer"><code>initializeSdk</code></a>:</p><pre><code>private fun initializeSdk() {
  val module = getSdkModule(requireNotNull(SignalDatabase.instance))
  val messageObserver = TeleMessageApplicationDependencyProvider.messageStoreObserver
  messageObserver.addProcessor(ArchiveMessagesProcessor(module))
  messageObserver.addProcessor(SendSignatureProcessor(module))
  messageObserver.initialize(module)
}</code></pre><p>This initializes the SDK module, passing in the <code>SignalDatabase</code> instance, which initializes that too.</p><p>Then it creates the message observer, and adds the <code>ArchiveMessagesProcessor</code> as a processor, passing in the SDK module (and hence, the <code>SignalDatabase</code>).</p><p>Now whenever messages get added to <code>SignalDatabase</code>, the following will happen:</p><ul><li><code>ArchiveMessageProcessor.processAfterMessageStateChanged</code> will run, calling <code>DataGrabber.setMessage</code>.</li><li><code>DataGrabber.setMessage</code> will save the message in the staging database and trigger the sync adapter to run.</li><li><code>SyncAdapter.onPerformSync</code> will select the message from the staging database and pass it into <code>NetworkManager.start</code>.</li><li><code>NetworkManager.start</code> will send the message to TeleMessage's archive server at <code>https://archive.telemessage.com</code>.</li></ul><p>Next, the <code>TeleMessageSignalApplication</code>'s <code>onCreate</code> method calls <code>initArchiveUrlsAndStartArchive</code>. You can read the code for <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/TM-SGNL-Android/blob/libs/app/src/tm/java/org/tm/archive/TeleMessageSignalApplication.kt#L75-L104" rel="noreferrer">that method here</a>, but the important part is where it it sets the URLs:</p><pre><code>CommonUtils.setUrl(context, ArchiveConstants.charlieProduction, ArchiveConstants.prodKeeper)</code></pre><p>These values are <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/TM-SGNL-Android/blob/libs/app/src/tm/java/org/archiver/ArchiveConstants.kt#L23-L24" rel="noreferrer">defined in</a> <code>ArchiveConstants</code>:</p><pre><code>const val charlieProduction = "https://rest.telemessage.com"
const val prodKeeper = "https://archive.telemessage.com"</code></pre><p>So basically, I stated above, <code>prodKeeper</code> is set to <code>https://archive.telemessage.com</code>, and this is ultimately where chat logs get sent. And finally, this method starts the sync adapter:</p><pre><code>CommonUtils.startBackupService(context)</code></pre><p>And then the app starts, with Signal messages getting synced to the archive server in the background.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>There's still a lot of this codebase that I haven't fully wrapped my mind around.</p><p>But after all of this analysis, it sure looked to me like TM SGNL is simply submitting plaintext chat logs to the TeleMessage archive server, completely breaking Signal's E2EE.</p><p>Still, I've only manually analyzed the source code. I haven't tried running it, much less setting up a dummy archive server to see what data the app tries to send (something that is worth trying, but that I haven't had nearly enough time to implement).</p><p>But on Saturday night, a hacker exploited a vulnerability in the archive server and exfiltrated plaintext messages from it, including Signal messages, as I <a href="https://micahflee.com/the-signal-clone-the-trump-admin-uses-was-hacked/" rel="noreferrer">reported</a> in 404 Media. This confirms my findings that communication between the TM SGNL app and the archive destination is not end-to-end encrypted, and that the archive server has access to plaintext chat logs.</p><h2 id="corroborative-evidence-from-the-hack">Corroborative evidence from the hack</h2><p>As Joseph Cox and I reported, a hacker was able to obtain "snapshots of data passing through TeleMessage’s servers at a point in time." The snapshots contained fragments of data, including chat logs in JSON format, that was in the archive server's memory at the moment it was exploited.</p><p>To prove that the archive server has plaintext access to chat logs, I'm sharing redacted samples of some of that data here. Below is a plaintext Signal message, a plaintext Telegram message, and a plaintext WhatsApp message.</p><p>I'm also sharing an encrypted WhatsApp message. As I hinted at earlier in this post, some of the chat logs have encrypted content, and I have not yet uncovered how that works.</p><p>The snapshots of data from my source contained fragments of WeChat messages, but no complete WeChat messages, so I don't have an example of those to show.</p><p>Finally, I'm also sharing a redacted screenshot of a private key I found in the snapshots of data from the archive server.</p><h3 id="a-plaintext-signal-message">A plaintext Signal message</h3><p>We mentioned a Signal message that was present in one of those snapshots:</p><blockquote>A message sent to a group chat called “Upstanding Citizens Brigade” included in the hacked data says its “source type” is “Signal,” indicating it came from TeleMessage’s modified version of the messaging app. The message itself was a link to this tweet posted on Sunday which is a clip of an NBC Meet the Press interview with President Trump about his memecoin. The hacked data includes phone numbers that were part of the group chat.</blockquote><p>Here's the JSON object version of that Signal message. I have redacted the phone numbers in this JSON object by replacing them with <code>==redacted==</code>.</p><pre><code>{

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Matt Godbolt, of <a href="https://godbolt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compiler Explorer</a> fame, is awesome and you should scour the web for every single bit of content he puts out. That is exactly what I was doing when I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSm3Haxz0I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Correct by Construction: APIs That Are Easy to Use and Hard to Misuse</a>. After 20+ years of working with C/C++, this theme resonates a lot with me.</p>
<p>While watching the talk I kept thinking "Yes! And that's why Rust does it that way." I came out at the end thinking that this talk was actually a great way of getting the intuition for how Rust helps you beyond the whole memory safety thing, and that is what this article intends to show.</p>
<p>But before we talk about that we should talk about the problems Matt raised and how he proposes to solve them in C++. Do yourself a favor and watch the full talk, but let me break one of them down!</p>
<h3>What's in a type</h3>
<p>Matt starts the talk by showing what a function that sends orders to a stock exchange might look like.</p>
<pre>void sendOrder(const char *symbol, bool buy, int quantity, double price)</pre>
<p>Before we go any further, let me just say he acknowledges floating point is not right for price and later talks about how he usually deals with it. But it makes for a nice example, bear with us.</p>
<p>Another obvious improvement that anyone used to this stuff will call out immediately is the bool for identifying a buy. That is error prone and Matt does call it out towards the end of this section.</p>
<p>But he first focuses on quantity and price and how C++ makes it really hard for you to stop callers from confusing them: the compiler will allow 1000.00 for quantity and 100 for price with no warnings, despite them being different types. It just silently converts.</p>
<p>How about some type aliasing?</p>
<pre>#include 

using Price = double;
using Quantity = int;

void sendOrder(const char *symbol, bool buy, int quantity, double price) {
  std::cout &lt;&lt; symbol &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; buy &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; quantity &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; price
            &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}

int main(void) {
  sendOrder("GOOG", false, Quantity(100), Price(1000.00)); // Correct
  sendOrder("GOOG", false, Price(1000.00), Quantity(100)); // Wrong
}</pre>
<p>No luck! Both clang 19 and gcc 14 will take that and not complain - <em>even with -std=c++23 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic</em>, which I use for all of the C++ code in this article! A few rounds of improvements and we have the following version:</p>
<pre>#include 

class Price {
public:
  explicit Price(double price) : m_price(price) {};
  double m_price;
};

class Quantity {
public:
  explicit Quantity(unsigned int quantity) : m_quantity(quantity) {};
  unsigned int m_quantity;
};

void sendOrder(const char *symbol, bool buy, Quantity quantity, Price price) {
  std::cout &lt;&lt; symbol &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; buy &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; quantity.m_quantity &lt;&lt; " "
            &lt;&lt; price.m_price &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}

int main(void) {
  sendOrder("GOOG", false, Quantity(100), Price(1000.00));  // Correct
  sendOrder("GOOG", false, Quantity(-100), Price(1000.00)); // Wrong
}</pre>
<p>We have classes, we have explicit constructors (very important or C++ will trip you!), we have unsigned types… and now it's hard to put a Price where you want a Quantity! But we can still give Quantity a negative value without a single compiler warning, even though we moved to an unsigned type. A bit more magic and we can make that go away:</p>
<pre>#include 
#include 

class Price {
public:
  explicit Price(double price) : m_price(price) {};
  double m_price;
};

class Quantity {
public:
  template  explicit Quantity(T quantity) : m_quantity(quantity) {
    static_assert(std::is_unsigned(), "Please use only unsigned types");
  }

  unsigned int m_quantity;
};

void sendOrder(const char *symbol, bool buy, Quantity quantity, Price price) {
  std::cout &lt;&lt; symbol &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; buy &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; quantity.m_quantity &lt;&lt; " "
            &lt;&lt; price.m_price &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}

int main(void) {
  sendOrder("GOOG", false, Quantity(100u), Price(1000.00)); // Correct
  sendOrder("GOOG", false, Quantity(-100), Price(1000.00)); // Wrong
}</pre>
<p>Finally we can get clang (and gcc) to complain loudly that this is being misused. All it took was a templated constructor that performs a static assert at compile time. Nice!</p>
<pre>order/order-5.cpp:13:19: error: static assertion failed due to requirement 'std::is_unsigned()': Please use only unsigned types
   13 |     static_assert(std::is_unsigned(), "Please use only unsigned types");
      |                   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
order/order-5.cpp:26:28: note: in instantiation of function template specialization 'Quantity::Quantity' requested here
   26 |   sendOrder("GOOG", false, Quantity(-100), Price(1000.00)); // Wrong
      |                            ^
1 error generated.</pre>
<p>It's a lot of code, but at least we now have compiler protection. We are good, there is no other way to misuse quantity and price. Right?</p>
<p>What if we need to pass in a value the user typed on a UI, such that we need to convert it from string? Well, you are out of luck again:</p>
<pre>sendOrder("GOOG", false, Quantity(static_cast(atoi("-100"))),
            Price(1000.00)); // Wrong</pre>
<p>Not only will it not fail to compile, but it will also not produce any errors at runtime. You will end up selling 4294967196 shares and going bankrupt.</p>
<p>Not ideal.</p>
<p>Matt keeps going, showing a few more magic tricks (and their pitfalls) to perform the runtime checks you will need to fully defend against this. I think this is a good point for us to stop on the C++ side and look at how Rust does, shall we?</p>
<h3>Enter Rust</h3>
<p>So is Rust any better? Rust has the benefit of decades of learning from all of these issues. And learn it did. Let's take a look. How does our first attempt fare?</p>
<pre>fn send_order(symbol: &amp;str, buy: bool, quantity: i64, price: f64) {
    println!("{symbol} {buy} {quantity} {price}");
}

fn main() {
    send_order("GOOG", false, 100, 1000.00); // Correct
    send_order("GOOG", false, 1000.00, 100); // Wrong
}</pre>
<p>After all the work we had to do with C++ it can't be this easy, can it?</p>
<pre>error[E0308]: arguments to this function are incorrect

  |
7 |     send_order("GOOG", false, 100, 1000.00); // Wrong
  |               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</pre>
<p>Welp, what do you know? It even tells us the arguments we swapped, and everything. It's like we live in the future! Ok, but numbers are still easy to confuse, we could also create types like we did in C++ to make it extra explicit, right? Indeed, and let's throw in protection against negative values by switching from i64 to u64. Is it that easy?</p>
<pre>struct Price(pub f64);

<p>Ok, all that remains is the case where we need to convert the number from a string the user typed. I got you now, Rust… runtime input is not something you can fix at compile time, how would you ever be able to improve on the C++ case?</p>

<p>Yes, it does help, I can’t just blindly cast.</p>
<p>Damn, you’re good.</p>
<p>This error should be enough for me as a user of this API to understand that I should elegantly handle this possibility and maybe return an error all the way to the UI saying "no negative numbers, please". But what if I just go ahead and add that .expect() it is telling me about and then a user types a negative number? Well, then I get a crash at runtime. Better than going bankrupt? I would say so.</p>

<h3>Closing thoughts</h3>
<p>You know what's the most interesting part of this whole article? The thing Rust is very famous for, memory safety, did not feature at all. Sure, you could make the argument that mixing integers with floats is a memory issue, but you'd be stretching the definition most people have for memory safety.</p>
<p>What we learn in this exercise is that a well designed language can protect you from mistakes in ways that go way beyond stopping you from writing a use after free or a data race. The design can save you a lot of brain cycles by not forcing you to think about how to protect your code from the simplest mistakes — the language has your back.</p>
<p>Now, let's be honest. Most of the brain power you save will go, as a Rust beginner, to figuring out how to convince the borrow checker what you are doing is correct. It gets better, I promise. But I won't lie to you: your first few months with the borrow checker will suck.</p>
<p>Are we done here? Not really. There are two more topics that Matt covers in his talk that I will discuss in future articles, one of them related to my biggest pet peeve with C++. And for those of you who are thinking "if C++ had decades to learn it would also have features that are this well designed", well… let's just say you are in for a treat.</p>
<p>Again, go check <a href="https://xania.org/MattGodbolt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Godbolt</a>. Listen to what the man says, read everything he writes, watch every video of his talks on YouTube, and play with his Compiler Explorer. You'll learn a lot and have fun while doing it!</p>

"Did you use an AI to find the problem or generate this submission?"

(and if they do select it, they can expect a stream of proof of actual intelligence follow-up questions)

2. We now ban every reporter INSTANTLY who submits reports we deem AI slop. A threshold has been reached. We are effectively being DDoSed. If we could, we would charge them for this waste of our time.

We still have not seen a single valid security report done with AI help.</p>

    <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN! We’re Will and Jeff from Exa (<a href="https://exa.ai/">https://exa.ai</a>). We recently launched Exa Websets, an embeddings-powered search engine designed to return exactly what you’re asking for. You can get precise results for complex queries like “all startups working on open-source developer tools based in SF, founded 2021-2025”. 
Demo here - <a href="https://youtu.be/Unt8hJmCxd4" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/Unt8hJmCxd4</a></p><p>We started working on Exa because we were frustrated that while LLM state-of-the-art is advancing every week, Google has gotten worse over time. The Internet used to feel like a magical information portal, but it doesn’t feel that way anymore when you’re constantly being pushed towards SEO-optimized clickbait.</p><p>Websets is a step in the opposite direction. For every search, we perform dozens of embedding searches over Exa’s vector database of the web to find good search candidates, then we run agentic workflows on each result to verify they match exactly what you asked for.</p><p>Websets results are good for two reasons. First, we train custom embedding models for our main search algorithm, instead of typical keyword matching search algorithms. Our embeddings models are trained specifically to return exactly the type of entity you ask for. In practice, that means if you search “startups working in nanotech”, keyword-based search engines return listicles about nanotech startups, because these listicles match the keywords in the query. In contrast, our embedding models return actual startup homepages, because these startup homepages match the meaning of the query.</p><p>The second is that LLMs provide the last-mile intelligence needed to verify every result. Each result and piece of data is backed with supporting references that we used to validate that the result is actually a match for your search criteria. That’s why Websets can take minutes or even hours to run, depending on your query and how many results you ask for. For valuable search queries, we think this is worth it.</p><p>Also notably, Websets are tables, not lists. You can add “enrichment” columns to find more information about each result, like “# of employees” or “does author have blog?”, and the cells asynchronously load in. This table format hopefully makes the web feel more like a database.</p><p>A few examples of searches that work with Websets:</p><p>- “Math blogs created by teachers from outside the US”: <a href="https://websets.exa.ai/cma1oz9xf007sis0ipzxgbamn">https://websets.exa.ai/cma1oz9xf007sis0ipzxgbamn</a></p><p>- "research paper about ways to avoid the O(n^2) attention problem in transformers, where one of the first author's first name starts with "A","B", "S", or "T", and it was written between 2018 and 2022”: <a href="https://websets.exa.ai/cm7dpml8c001ylnymum4sp11h">https://websets.exa.ai/cm7dpml8c001ylnymum4sp11h</a></p><p>- “US based healthcare companies, with over 100 employees and a technical founder": <a href="https://websets.exa.ai/cm6lc0dlk004ilecmzej76qx2">https://websets.exa.ai/cm6lc0dlk004ilecmzej76qx2</a></p><p>- “all software engineers in the Bay Area, with experience in startups, who know Rust and have published technical content before”: <a href="https://youtu.be/knjrlm1aibQ" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/knjrlm1aibQ</a></p><p>You can try it at <a href="https://websets.exa.ai/">https://websets.exa.ai/</a> and API docs are at <a href="https://docs.exa.ai/websets">https://docs.exa.ai/websets</a>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43906442">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi everyone, my name is Kevin Lin, and this is a Show HN for my sheet music smart glasses project. My video was on the front page on Friday: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43876243">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43876243</a>, but dang said we should do a Show HN as well, so here goes!</p><p>I’ve wanted to put sheet music into smart glasses for a long time, but the perfect opportunity to execute came in mid-February, when Mentra (YC W25) tweeted about a smart glasses hackathon they were hosting - winners would get to take home a pair. I went, had a blast making a bunch of music-related apps with my teammate, and we won, so I got to take them home, refine the project, and make a pretty cool video about it (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j36u2i7PKKE" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j36u2i7PKKE</a>).</p><p>The glasses are Even Realities G1s. They look normal, but they have two microphones, a screen in each lens, and can be even made with a prescription. Every person I’ve met who tried them on was surprised at how good the display is, and the video recordings of them unfortunately don’t do them justice.</p><p>The software runs on AugmentOS, which is Mentra’s smart glasses operating system that works on various 3rd-party smart glasses, including the G1s. All I had to do to make an app was write and run a typescript file using the AugmentOS SDK. This gives you the voice transcription and raw audio as input, and text or bitmaps available as output to the screens, everything else is completely abstracted away. Your glasses communicate with an AugmentOS app, and then the app communicates with your typescript service.</p><p>The only hard part was creating a Python script to turn sheet music (MusicXML format) into small, optimized bitmaps to display on the screens. To start, the existing landscape of music-related Python libraries is pretty poorly documented and I ran into multiple never-before-seen error messages. Downscaling to the small size of the glasses screens also meant that stems and staff lines were disappearing, so I thought to use morphological dilation to emphasize those without making the notes unintelligible.  The final pipeline was MusicXML -&gt; music21 library to render chunks of bars to png -&gt; dilate with opencv- &gt; downscale -&gt; convert to bitmap with Pillow -&gt; optimize bitmaps with imagemagick. This is far from the best code I’ve ever written, but the LLMs attempt at this whole task was abysmal and my years of Python experience really got to shine here. The code is on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/kevinlinxc/AugmentedChords">https://github.com/kevinlinxc/AugmentedChords</a>.</p><p>Putting it together, my typescript service serves these bitmaps locally when requested. I put together a UI where I can navigate menus and sheet music with voice commands (e.g. show catalog, next, select, start, exit, pause) and then I connected foot pedals to my laptop. Because of bitmap sending latency (~3s right now, but future glasses will do better), using foot pedals to turn the bars while playing wasn’t viable, so I instead had one of my pedals toggle autoscrolling, and the other two pedals sped up/temporarily paused the scrolling.</p><p>After lots of adjustments, I was able to play a full song using just the glasses! It took many takes and there was definitely lots of room for improvement. For example: - Bitmap sending is pretty slow, which is why using the foot pedals to turn bars wasn’t viable. - The resolution is pretty small, I would love to put more bars in at once so I can flip less frequently. - Since foot pedals aren’t portable, it would be cool to have a mode where the audio dictates when the sheet music changes. I tried implementing that with FFT but it was often wrong and more effort is needed. Head tilt controls would be cool too, because full manual control is a hard requirement for practicing.</p><p>All of these pain points are being targeted by Mentra and other companies competing in the space, and so I’m super excited to see the next generation! Also, feel free to ask me anything!</p></div></td></div></div>]]></description>

            <guid>43905299</guid>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://accent-strength.boldvoice.com/">https://accent-strength.boldvoice.com/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43905299">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <section id="intro">
          <p>
            We work with accents a lot at
            <a href="https://boldvoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BoldVoice</a>, the AI-powered accent coaching app for non-native English
            speakers. Accents are subtle patterns in speech—vowel shape, timing,
            pitch, and more. Usually, you need a linguist to make sense of these
            qualities. However, our goal at BoldVoice is to get machines to
            understand accents, and machines don’t think like linguists. So, we
            ask: how does a machine learning model understand an accent, and
            specifically, how strong it is?
          </p>
          <p>
            To begin this journey, we first introduce the “accent fingerprint,”
            an embedding that is generated by inferencing an English speech
            recording through BoldVoice’s large-scale accented speech model.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code>torch.Size([1, 768, 12])</code></pre>
            <figcaption>The accent fingerprint embedding dimensions</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            In this post we’ll show where the accent fingerprint lives in a
            latent space, how distances and directions in that space correspond
            to accent similarity and language background, and how we use it to
            coach our product management intern Victor, a non-native English
            speaker, toward the American English accent of our expert accent
            coach Eliza.
          </p>

          <h3>The Original Recordings</h3>
          <p>First off, here's how Victor sounds when speaking English:</p>
          <figure>
            <audio controls="" src="https://accent-strength.boldvoice.com/victor-original.wav"></audio>
            <figcaption>Victor (original recording)</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Now have a listen to Eliza reading the same passage. Eliza is
            demonstrating our “target” American accent.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <audio controls="" src="https://accent-strength.boldvoice.com/eliza-original.wav"></audio>
            <figcaption>Eliza's recording</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Compared to Eliza, who is an American English native speaker, Victor
            has a noticeably strong Chinese accent when speaking English.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="latent-space">
          <h3>The Latent Space</h3>
          <p>
            So that we can make sense of how the machine learning model
            understands both of these recordings, we now populate a latent space
            with 1,000 speech recordings sourced from our internal data
            representing varied levels of accent. Feel free to inspect the 2D
            visualization of the latent space<sup>1</sup> and hover over the
            points to see details about each recording.
          </p>

          <p>
            The full dimensional latent space contains information about speaker
            identity, accent, intelligibility, emotion, and other
            characteristics. This visualization has been pruned to show only the
            information relevant to "accent strength", that is "how strong is
            the speaker's accent relative to native speakers of English?"
          </p>
          <p>
            More specifically, we apply PLS regression to identify the latent
            space directions which correlate most with human accent strength
            ratings, and for the purpose of this visualization only, we apply 2D
            UMAP dimensionality reduction. The x-axis represents the first
            hidden dimension of accent strength, while the y-axis represents the
            second hidden dimension.<sup>2</sup>
          </p>

          <p>
            The below pseudocode shows how the dimensions of the latent space
            are selected:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code>accent_strength_directions = PLSRegression.fit(train_accent_fingerprints, train_accent_strength_ratings)
accent_strength_features = test_accent_fingerprints[accent_strength_directions]
visualization_features = UMAP(n_components=2).fit_transform(accent_strength_features)</code></pre>
          </figure>

          <p>
            <sup>1</sup> For the sake of brevity, we will use the term latent
            space to refer to both the full dimensional space, as well as the
            pruned 2D visualization.
          </p>
          <p>
            <sup>2</sup> The dimensions are not readily interpretable, are not
            orthogonal, and are chosen solely to maximize their utility for
            discriminating between accent strength in L2 English (English as a
            second language).
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="victor-original">
          <h3>Plotting Accents</h3>
          <p>
            Now, let’s visualize the accent fingerprints of Victor’s and Eliza’s
            recordings in this latent space. You can see a purple diamond in the
            bottom left representing Eliza’s recording and a yellow diamond
            towards the top right representing Victor’s recording.
          </p>

          <p>
            From what we can see, the more towards the lower left of the plot a
            recording is, the more ”native sounding” and “less strong” its
            speaker’s accent is. Accordingly, we labeled the points as Native,
            Near Native, Advanced, Intermediate, and Beginner based on their
            distance from Eliza’s position in the latent space.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another finding we immediately see is that the latent space is not
            biased towards different native languages, as we don’t see any
            clustering based on the speaker’s native language, and a fairly
            uniform distribution of native languages across all proficiency
            levels.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, let’s look at some creative ways that we can use our in-house
            suite of speech models and tools to help Victor get closer to
            Eliza’s accent.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="victor-cleaned">
          <h3>Cleaning the Background Noise</h3>
          <p>
            The first thing that jumps out is that Eliza’s recording is much
            cleaner than Victor’s. Perhaps it will be easier for him to focus on
            just the accent differences if we can get rid of the background
            noise in his recording?
          </p>
          <figure>
            <audio controls="" src="https://accent-strength.boldvoice.com/victor-cleaned.wav"></audio>
            <figcaption>Victor (cleaned recording)</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Surprise! This didn’t change Victor's position in the latent space
            much, the cleaned recording lands very close to Victor's original at
            the top right of the latent space. This is a good sanity check that
            our latent space is working correctly—the recording quality and
            level background noise are not relevant to accent strength.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="victor-converted">
          <h3>Converting the Accent</h3>
          <p>
            Next, perhaps Victor finds it difficult to mimic Eliza’s accent
            because the register of his voice is so much lower than hers. So
            we’re going to use BoldVoice’s in-house accent conversion model to
            hear what Victor sounds like with Eliza's accent. (Yes, we can
            really do that—we'll share more about this in a future post.)
          </p>
          <figure>
            <audio controls="" src="https://accent-strength.boldvoice.com/victor-cleaned.wav"></audio>
            <figcaption>Victor's original recording</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure>
            <audio controls="" src="https://accent-strength.boldvoice.com/victor-converted.wav"></audio>
            <figcaption>Victor (converted recording)</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            As you can see, the position of Victor with Eliza’s accent is right
            next to Eliza’s original position in the latent space. Phonetically
            speaking, there are still some differences in vowel shapes,
            emphasis, pitch, and timing, but even without expert knowledge,
            Victor will have a much easier time mimicking Eliza’s accent now
            that it’s in his own voice.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="victor-after">
          <h3>Practicing the Accent</h3>
          <p>
            We left Victor with this audio of his voice with Eliza's accent for
            about 10 minutes to give him time to practice mimicking it. Here’s
            what Victor sounds like after that practice:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <audio controls="" src="https://accent-strength.boldvoice.com/victor-after.wav"></audio>
            <figcaption>Victor (after practice recording)</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure>
            <audio controls="" src="https://accent-strength.boldvoice.com/eliza-original.wav"></audio>
            <figcaption>Compare to Eliza's original recording</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Not bad—Victor matched her timing, intonation and stress pretty
            well, but some of the vowel shapes still aren’t quite the same.
            Let’s see how far he is from Eliza in the latent space now.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s quite an improvement! Victor’s new position in the latent
            space is right on the border of Intermediate and Advanced.
          </p>
          <p>
            If Victor wanted to move beyond this point, the sound-by-sound
            phonetic analysis available in the BoldVoice app would allow him to
            understand the patterns in pronunciation and stress that contribute
            to Eliza’s accent and teach him how to apply them in his own speech.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion">
          <h3>What did we learn?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This machine learning model can clearly distinguish the strength
              of a speaker’s accent.
            </li>
            <li>
              The model’s assessment of accent strength appears independent of
              the speaker's native language background.
            </li>
            <li>
              The accent strength of a speaker is something that can be changed
              with practice.
            </li>
            <li>
              Voice conversion technology can map a target accent onto a
              different voice, providing a useful tool for practice.
            </li>
            <li>
              Changes to the acoustic environment, such as denoising, don’t
              result in a large change in measured accent strength.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Applications and Next Steps</h3>
          <p>
            The accent strength metric derived from this model has several
            promising applications.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              It offers a quantitative way to track an English learner’s accent
              journey over multiple recordings by measuring their distance from
              a target accent profile in the latent space.
            </li>
            <li>
              This same quantitative approach can be applied to rigorously
              evaluate automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for
              performance variations across different accent strengths.
            </li>
            <li>
              It can similarly monitor text-to-speech (TTS) systems for unwanted
              changes in accent, often referred to as “accent drift.”
            </li>
          </ol>

         Northwestern scientists have identified an antibiotic that cures Lyme disease at a fraction of the dosage of the current “gold standard” treatment and discovered what may cause a treated infection to mimic chronic illness in patients.  </p>


        </div>

        
            <div id="news-story">
                        <p>Lyme disease, a disease transmitted when deer ticks feed on infected animals like deer and rodents, and then bite humans, impacts nearly <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/data-research/facts-stats/index.html#:~:text=Recent%20estimates%20using%20other%20methods,not%20actually%20have%20Lyme%20disease.">half a million</a> individuals in the U.S. annually. Lyme can be devastating; but early treatment with antibiotics can prevent chronic symptoms like heart and neurological problems and arthritis from developing.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What’s new</strong></h2>
<p>In two new studies led by bacteriologist <a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=62640">Brandon L. Jutras</a>, Northwestern scientists have identified an antibiotic that cures Lyme disease at a fraction of the dosage of the current “gold standard” treatment and discovered what may cause a treated infection to mimic chronic illness in patients. The studies were published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</p>
<p>Jutras, who joined Northwestern faculty last summer, is an associate professor of microbiology-immunology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a member of the Center for Human Immunobiology at Northwestern. He has been studying Lyme disease for more than 15 years.</p>
<h2><strong>Besting the gold standard</strong></h2>
<p>The antibiotic doxycycline is the current gold standard treatment for Lyme. However, doxycycline and other generic antibiotics, wreak havoc on the microbiome, killing beneficial bacteria in the gut and causing troubling side effects even as it kills <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>, the bacteria that causes Lyme. In addition to its negative impact on the gut, doxycycline also fails to help between 10 and 20% of individuals who take it, and it is not approved for use in young children —&nbsp;who are at the highest risk of tick bites, and therefore, of developing Lyme.</p>
<p>More effective, or at least more specified, treatment options are needed as climate change extends tick seasons and <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-lyme-disease#:~:text=Between%201992%20and%202022%2C%20the%20incidence%20of,per%20100%2C000%20people%20in%202022%20(Figure%201).&amp;text=Lyme%20disease%20is%20much%20more%20common%20in,Midwest%20than%20in%20other%20regions%20(Figure%202).">Lyme becomes more prevalent</a>.</p>
<p>Northwestern scientists identified that piperacillin, an antibiotic in the same class as penicillin, effectively cured mice of Lyme disease at 100-times less than the effective dose of doxycycline. At such a low dose, piperacillin also had the added benefit of “having virtually no impact on resident gut microbes,” <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adr9091">according to the study</a>.</p>
<p>The team screened nearly 500 medicines in a drug library, using a molecular framework to understand potential interactions between antibiotics and the Borrelia bacteria. Once the group had a short list of potentials, they performed additional physiological, cellular and molecular tests to identify compounds that did not impact other bacteria.</p>
<p>The authors argue that piperacillin, which has already been FDA-approved as a safe treatment for pneumonia, could also be a candidate for preemptive interventions for those potentially exposed to Lyme (with a known deer tick bite).</p>
<p>They found that piperacillin exclusively interfered with the unusual cell wall synthesis pattern common to Lyme bacteria, preventing the bacteria from growing or dividing and ultimately leading to its death.</p>
<h2><strong>Understanding when Lyme lingers</strong></h2>
<p>Symptoms that persist long after Lyme disease is treated are not uncommon —&nbsp;a <a href="https://www.hopkinslyme.org/lyme-disease/treatment-and-prognosis-of-lyme-disease/#:~:text=Most%20patients%20with%20early%20Lyme,includes%20misdiagnoses%20and%20treatment%20delays.">2022 study found</a> that 14% of patients who were diagnosed and treated early with antibiotic therapy would still develop Post Treatment Lyme Disease (PTLD). Yet doctors puzzle over the condition’s causes and how to help their patients through symptoms ranging from severe fatigue and cognitive challenges to body pain and arthritis.</p>
<p>Northwestern scientists believe they now know what causes the treated infection to mimic chronic illness: The body may be responding to remnants of the Borrelia cell wall which breaks down during treatment yet lingers in the liver. (This matches one theory behind the underlying causes of long COVID-19, in that persisting viral molecules may encourage a strong, albeit unnecessary, immune response, according to Jutras.)</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adr2955">another new study</a>, researchers tracked the biodistribution of peptidoglycan, a structural feature of virtually all bacterial cells and a common target of antibiotics, from different bacteria. They found that Lyme disease’s peptidoglycan persists for weeks to months.</p>
<p>Lyme’s peptidoglycan is structurally unique, and this difference may be behind its persistence in humans. Instead of looking the same as with other bacteria, the Lyme peptidoglycan is fundamentally distinct, which is facilitated in part by sucking up sugars from its tick vector. Upon bacterial cell death — by antibiotics or the immune system — surviving molecules tend to relocate to the liver, which can’t process the modified peptidoglycan. Without this modification, it seems likely that the peptidoglycan would clear right away, as in other infections.</p>
<p>“The unusual chemical properties of Borrelia peptidoglycan promote persistence, but it’s the individual patient response to the molecule that likely impacts the overall clinical outcome,” Jutras said. “Some patients will have a more robust or stronger immune response, which could result in a worse disease outcome, while the immune system of others may largely ignore the molecule. So, in essence, it’s not about whether the molecule is there or not, it’s more about how an individual responds to it.”</p>
<h2><strong>What’s next</strong></h2>
<p>Jutras hopes the groundbreaking findings will lead to development of more accurate tests, possibly for PTLD patients, and refined treatment options when antibiotics have failed. To effectively stymie PTLD, instead of neutralizing an infection that may no longer exist, efforts are underway to neutralize the inflammatory molecule.</p>
<p>Lyme prevention also remains a challenge — no approved human vaccine exists — and Jutras hopes his research moving forward will help with developing proactive strategies to diagnose and treat it.</p>
<p>“I think the future for Lyme disease patients is bright in that we are approaching an era of customized medicine, and we can potentially create a particular drug, or a combination to treat Lyme disease when others fail,” Jutras said. “The more we understand about the various strains and species of Lyme disease-causing Borrelia, the closer we get to a custom approach.”</p>

            <div>
                <p><strong>May 6, 2025</strong> – Ubuntu 25.10 is set to adopt <strong>sudo-rs</strong> by default. Sudo-rs is a memory-safe reimplementation of the widely-used <code>sudo</code> utility, written in the Rust programming language.</p>
<p>This move is part of a broader effort by <strong>Canonical</strong> to improve the resilience and maintainability of core system components. Sudo-rs is developed by the <strong>Trifecta Tech Foundation (TTF)</strong>, a nonprofit organization that creates secure, open source building blocks for infrastructure software.</p>
<h3 id="a-memory-safe-future-for-ubuntu">A Memory-Safe Future for Ubuntu</h3>
<p>The decision to adopt sudo-rs is in line with Canonical’s commitment to <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/carefully-but-purposefully-oxidising-ubuntu/56995">Carefully But Purposefully</a> increase the resilience of critical system software, by adopting Rust. Rust is a programming language with strong memory safety guarantees that eliminates many of the vulnerabilities that have historically plagued traditional C-based software.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm delighted to be investing in critical, low-level software utilities. Ubuntu is the most widely deployed Linux operating system, and by choosing to adopt sudo-rs I hope to accelerate the path to wider adoption across the Linux ecosystem".<br>
-- Jon Seager, VP Engineering Ubuntu at Canonical</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sudo-rs is part of the Trifecta Tech Foundation's <a href="https://trifectatech.org/initiatives/privilege-boundary/">Privilege Boundary initiative</a>, which aims to handle privilege escalation with memory-safe alternatives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While no piece of software - in any language - is flawless, we believe the transition to Rust in systems programming is a vital step forward. It is very exciting to see Ubuntu committing to sudo-rs and taking a leading role in moving the needle."<br>
-- Erik Jonkers, Chair of the Trifecta Tech Foundation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="preparing-for-mainstream-adoption-by-linux-distributions">Preparing for Mainstream Adoption by Linux Distributions</h3>
<p>To prepare for mainstream adoption, the maintainers of sudo-rs will complete work outlined in the project’s <a href="https://trifectatech.org/initiatives/workplans/sudo-rs/#current-work">Milestone 5 workplan</a>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coarse-grained shell escape prevention (NOEXEC) on Linux</li>
<li>The ability to control AppArmor profiles</li>
<li><code>sudoedit</code></li>
<li>Support for Linux Kernels older than version 5.9, used by Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</li>
</ul>
<p>Canonical is sponsoring this milestone to make sudo-rs an even better implementation of the <code>sudo</code> command. With the above features, more users and system administrators should be able to use sudo-rs without any change to their current workflows.</p>
<p>The maintainers of sudo-rs are sticking to the "less is more" approach: some features of the original sudo will not be implemented in sudo-rs if they serve only highly niche use cases. The maintainers continue their collaboration with Todd Miller, the incumbent <code>sudo</code> maintainer for over thirty years, thus indirectly improving original sudo as a by-product of this engagement.</p>
<h3 id="targeting-ubuntu-25-10">Targeting Ubuntu 25.10</h3>
<p>Canonical plans to make sudo-rs the default in Ubuntu 25.10. This will allow time for acceptance testing by end-users and ensure that sudo-rs is battle-tested before its inclusion in the next Long Term Support (LTS) release: Ubuntu 26.04 LTS, which will be supported for a minimum of 12 years. We are looking forward to learning from the community how we can further improve sudo-rs.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header></header><section><p>What does it mean to get things done? In the abstract, you can complete a mathematical proof or a problem set, but the real world is much fuzzier. Suppose I plant a tree in my backyard. Once the sapling is in the ground, is that done? Not really. There’s always more work to do: clearing the ground around it, watering, keeping pests away, pruning, and so on. Programming large web applications is more like planting a tree than completing a mathematical proof. Once you write a service, you can keep working on it forever if you want to.</p>
<p>In large tech companies, this fact is a trap for competent but unagentic engineers. They see an infinite queue of tasks that they’re capable of doing, and they start delivering a stream of marginal improvements to a particular subsystem<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. From their perspective, it feels like they’re crushing it. After all, they’re putting out work at their top speed: no downtime, no waiting on other teams. But they’re not doing their actual job, which is to deliver the most value they can to their company. From the perspective of their manager and skip-level, they’re not getting anything done.</p>
<p>What does it mean to get things done in large companies? Most importantly, it means <strong>finishing</strong> things. How can you finish things in a world where you can keep improving systems indefinitely? It means <strong>getting them to a point where the decision-makers at the company are happy</strong>. At that point, you have to declare victory and walk away! Go and do something else! I’ve seen many engineers stick around delivering one more tweak or one more refactor - long past the point where their work stopped being perceived as a successful project and started being perceived as wasted time. Better to deliver two more things in that time.</p>
<p>Second, it means delivering the kind of things that are <strong>legible</strong> to the decision-makers at the company: i.e. visible to your manager, plus 1-3 skip levels, depending on your title. The easiest way to do this is to deliver things that they already know about, such as projects that they’ve asked you to do, or incidents that are serious enough that they’re involved in them. It’s possible to make other work legible to them as well. If your work produces or saves money, that will make it immediately legible, for instance (or you could just be really convincing). By default, work you do isn’t legible: to the decision-makers, it’s generic technical nonsense. They don’t know whether it’s crucial high-impact work or pointless code reshuffling, and will tend to assume the latter.</p>
<p>In short, getting things done means getting them in a state where:</p>
<p>(a) executives at the company understand what’s happened, and
(b) are happy with it</p>
<p>To many, this will be an unsatisfying definition of what it means to get things done. Lots of engineers will want a more solid definition than “it’s a social construct”. However, as someone with a philosophy background, I have a healthy respect for social constructs. The concept “chair” is a social construct, and chairs are plenty real[2]. In some ways, “getting things done” is even more real. It can pay your rent! If you don’t respect it, it can even get you fired.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Just because you’re doing work doesn’t mean you’re getting things done</li>
<li>Nothing is ever “done” in the non-abstract world. Everything can be worked on indefinitely</li>
<li>If you want to get things done you can’t be a gardener. You have to aim for a bullet-point list of achievements</li>
<li>So what’s “done” mean in that context? It means the company is happy with the state of it</li>
<li>Declare victory and walk away: go and do something else!</li>

&nbsp; <p><img src="https://images.static-bluray.com/rating/b10.jpg" width="69" height="13" alt="5.0 of 5"></p><p><a href="https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/screenshot.php?movieid=381411&amp;position=2"><img id="load60766577487553" src="https://images.static-bluray.com/transparent.gif" loading="lazy" width="728" height="409"></a></p><p>
Presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1, encoded with MPEG-4 AVC and granted a 1080p transfer, <i>Sneakers</i> arrives on Blu-ray courtesy of Kino Lorber. </p><p>

The release introduces a new 4K makeover of <i>Sneakers</i> struck from the original camera negative. The 4K makeover is also made available on 4K Blu-ray in <a href="https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Sneakers-4K-Blu-ray/343185/#Review"><i>this</i></a> combo pack.</p><p>

I have only one other release of <i>Sneakers</i> in my library, which is <a href="https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Sneakers-Blu-ray/65706/#Review"><i>this</i></a> Region-B release, produced by Universal Pictures-UK in 2013. I think that the previous presentation of the film is mostly good, but it has a dated appearance that was undeniable even more than a decade ago. (At that time, virtually all older masters that emerged from the major's vault produced very harsh visuals with unpleasant digital appearance. The old master that was used to produce the previous release of the film was one of the few that had fine organic qualities). After viewing the 4K makeover in its entirety on 4K Blu-ray and then spending time with it on the Blu-ray, I did not think that comparisons with the previous release were needed. The 4K makeover brings substantial improvements in all areas we scrutinize in our reviews, and they are very, very easy to appreciate on 4K Blu-ray and Blu-ray. For example, the darker/dark material where colored light and shadows constantly interact convey outstanding delineation, clarity, and depth. In some areas, there is simply a lot more to see, and the perception of depth is completely different now because of how entire ranges of nuances look. Also, the density levels are terrific on 4K Blu-ray and Blu-ray. The entire 4K makeover is graded with outstanding precision, too. All primaries and supporting nuances are impeccably set and balanced, allowing the visuals to reveal an enormously attractive period appearance. Because of the expanded color gamut and superior dynamic range of 4K, I think that the strength and accuracy of the color grade are more impressive in native 4K. However, I must make it clear that the Blu-ray still offers a mighty fine upgrade in quality. Image stability is excellent. The entire film looks spotless as well. (<i>Note</i>: This is a Region-A "locked" Blu-ray release. Therefore, you must have a native Region-A or Region-Free player in order to access its content). </p></div>

There are two standard audio tracks on this release: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and English DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0. Optional English SDH subtitles are provided for the main feature. </p><p>

I viewed the new 4K makeover of <i>Sneakers</i> in its entirety and later spent time with it on the Blu-ray. The comments below are from our review of the 4K Blu-ray/Blu-ray combo pack release.</p><p>

I viewed a good portion of <i>Sneakers</i> with the 2.0 track and liked it a lot. It has a great dynamic range and is very, very healthy. The 5.1 track is good, too. However, I have always felt that it could have had more surround movement to impress as a 5.1 track. Some of the action sequences throughout the film create great opportunities for impressive surround movement, but there is hardly anything meaningful happening there. The dialog is clear, sharp, stable, and easy to follow.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://notashelf.dev/posts/curse-of-knowing">https://notashelf.dev/posts/curse-of-knowing</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43902212">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-gjtny2mx="">  <p>It starts innocently.</p>
<p>You rename a batch of files with a ten-line Python script, or you alias a common
<code>git</code> command to shave off two keystrokes. Maybe you build a small shell
function to format JSON from the clipboard.</p>
<p>You’re not even trying to be clever. You’re just solving tiny problems. Making
the machine do what it should have done in the first place. And then something
happens. You cross a <em>threshold</em>. You look at your tools, your environment, your
operating system—even your editor—and suddenly <strong>everything</strong> is fair game.</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> rebuild that (if you wanted to).<br>
You could <em>improve</em> that (if you wanted to).</p>
<p>Then someone challenges you. As banter maybe, perhaps jokingly but also with a
dash of hope. Then the air in the room changes.</p>
<p>It suddenly becomes something else. It becomes:</p>
<p>You <em>should</em>.</p>
<p>And from that moment forward, the world is broken in new and specific ways that
only <em>you</em> can see.</p>
<h2 id="technical-capability-as-a-moral-weight">Technical Capability as a Moral Weight</h2>
<p>Before I could program, broken software was frustrating but ignorable. For years
I’ve simply “used” a computer, as a consumer. I was what companies were
concerned with tricking into buying their products, or subscribing to their
services. Not the technical geek that they prefer to avoid with their software
releases, or banning from their games based on an OS.</p>
<p>Now it has become <em>provocative</em>. I can see the patterns that I wish I couldn’t,
find oversights that I can attribute to a certain understanding (or the lack
thereof) of a certain concept and I can <em>hear</em> what has been echoing in the head
of the computer illiterate person who conjured the program I have to debug.</p>
<p>I notice flaws like a good surgeon notices a limp.<br>
Why the <em>hell</em> does this site send ten megabytes of JavaScript for a static
page?<br>
Why is the CLI output not parseable by <code>awk</code>?<br>
Why is this config hardcoded when it could be declarative?</p>
<p>Those things are <em>not</em> just questions, they are <em>accusations</em>. And,
unfortunately, they do not stop.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve learned to notice, my perception of software has changed in its
entirety.</p>
<p>Every piece of software becomes a TODO list.<br>
Every system becomes a scaffolding for a better one.<br>
Every inconvenience becomes an indictment of inaction.</p>
<h2 id="one-must-imagine-sisyphus-happy">One Must Imagine Sisyphus Happy</h2>
<p>Like Camus’ Sisyphus, we are condemned to push the boulder of our own systems
uphill—one fix, one refactor, one script at a time. But unlike the story of
Sisyphus, the curse is not placed onto you by some god. We built the boulder
ourselves. And we keep polishing it on the way up.</p>
<p>I’ve lost count of how many projects I have started that began with some
variation of “Yeah, I could build this <em>but better</em>.”</p>
<ul>
<li>A static site generator because the existing ones had too many opinions.</li>
<li>A note-taking tool because I didn’t like the way others structured metadata.</li>
<li>A CLI task runner because Make is cryptic and Taskfile is YAML hell.</li>
<li>A personal wiki engine in Rust, then in Go, then in Nim, then back to
Markdown.</li>
<li>A homelab dashboard because I don’t like webslop.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list continues, and trust me it <em>does</em> continue. My dev directory, as it
stands, is nearing 30 gigabytes.</p>
<p>If you ask me, I was solving real, innocent problems. But in hindsight, I was
also feeding something else: a compulsion to assert control. Every new tool I
built was a sandbox I <em>owned</em>: No weird bugs. No legacy constraints. No
decisions I didn’t entirely agree with. Until, of course, I became the legacy.</p>
<p>Kafka once wrote that “<strong>a cage went in search of a bird</strong>.” <sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> That is what
these projects can become. Empty systems we keep building, waiting for purpose,
for clarity, for… salvation? I’m not sure how else would you call this
pursuit.</p>
<h2 id="entropy-is-undefeated">Entropy Is Undefeated</h2>
<p>Now let’s go back. Back to when we didn’t know better.</p>
<p>Software doesn’t stay solved. Every solution you write starts to rot the moment
it exists. Not now, not later, but eventually. Libraries deprecate. APIs
change. Performance regressions creep in. Your once-perfect tool breaks silently
because <code>libfoo.so</code> is now <code>libfoo.so.2</code>. <sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I <em>have</em> had scripts silently fail because a website changed its HTML layout.<br>
I <em>have</em> had configuration formats break because of upstream version bumps.<br>
I <em>have</em> had Docker containers die because Alpine Linux rotated a mirror URL.</p>
<p>In each case, the immediate emotional response was not just inconvenience but
something that moreso resembles <em>guilt</em>. I built this, and I do know better. How
could I not have foreseen this? Time to fix it.</p>
<p>If you replace every part of the system over time, is it still the same tool?
Does it still serve the same purpose? Do <em>you</em>?</p>
<h2 id="the-illusion-of-finality">The Illusion of Finality</h2>
<p>I think we lie to ourselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If I just get this setup right, I’ll never have to touch it again."<br>
"If I just write this one tool, my workflow will be seamless."<br>
"If I automate this, I’ll save time forever.” <sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup><br>
“Write once, run everywhere.” My ass.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is, I admit, a seductive lie. It frames programming as a conquest of sorts. A
series of battles you win, or challenges you complete. But the imaginary war
never ends. You don’t build a castle. You dig trenches. And they flood every
time it rains. The trials are <em>never</em> complete.</p>
<h2 id="technical-work-as-emotional-regulation">Technical Work as Emotional Regulation</h2>
<p>On the theme of filling this post with literary references, let me quote the
Stoic Marcus Aurelius.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will
find strength.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But programming lures us into believing we <em>can</em> control the outside events.
That is where the suffering begins. There is something deeper happening here.
This is <em>not</em> just about software.</p>
<p>I believe sometimes building things is how we self-soothe. We write a new tool
or a script because we are in a desperate need for a small victory. We write a
new tool because we are overwhelmed. Refactor it, not because the code is messy,
but your life is. We chase the perfect system because it gives us something to
hold onto when everything else is spinning. This is the lesson I’ve taken from
using NixOS.</p>
<p>I have written entire applications just to avoid thinking about why I was
unhappy. Programming gives you instant feedback. You run the thing, and it
works. Or it <em>doesn’t</em>, and you fix it. Either way, you’re <em>doing something</em>.</p>
<p>That kind of agency is addictive. Especially when the rest of life doesn’t offer
it. We program because we <em>can</em>, even when we shouldn’t. Because at least it
gives us something to rebel against.</p>
<h2 id="the-burnout-you-dont-see-coming">The Burnout You Don’t See Coming</h2>
<p>Burnout doesn not just come from overwork. It comes from <em>overresponsibility</em>.</p>
<p>And programming, once internalized deeply enough, makes everything feel like
your responsibility. The bloated website. The inefficient script. The clunky
onboarding process at your job. You <em>could</em> fix it. So why aren’t you?</p>
<p>The truth you are very well aware of is that you can’t fix it all. You <em>know</em>
this, you always knew it regardless of your level of skill. But try telling that
to the part of your brain that sees every inefficiency as a moral failing.</p>
<p>Nietzsche warned of gazing too long into the abyss. But he didn <em>not</em> warn what
happens when the abyss is a <code>Makefile</code> or a 30k line of code Typescript project.</p>
<h2 id="learning-to-let-go">Learning to Let Go</h2>
<p>So where is the exit? Is this akin to Sartre’s depiction of hell, where hell
<em>is</em> other people and how they interact with your software? Or is it some weird
backwards hell where people create software that you have to interact with?</p>
<p>The first step is recognizing that <em>not everything broken is yours to fix</em>.<br>
Not every tool needs replacing.<br>
Not every bad experience is a call to action.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it’s OK to just <em>use</em> the thing. Sometimes it’s enough to know <em>why</em>
it’s broken—even if you don’t fix it. Sometimes the most disciplined thing you
can do is <em>walk away</em> from the problem you know how to solve. There’s a kind of
strength in that.</p>
<p>Not apathy, no. Nor laziness. Just… some restraint.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-kind-of-skill">A New Kind of Skill</h2>
<p>What if the real skill isn’t technical mastery? Or better yet what if it’s
emotional clarity?</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowing which problems are worth your energy.</li>

<p>This is what I’m trying to learn now. After the excitement. After the obsession.
After the burnout. I’m trying to let things stay a little broken. Because I’ve
realized I don’t want to <em>fix everything</em>. I just want to feel OK in a world
that often isn’t. I can fix something, but not everything.</p>

<p>You learn how to program. You learn how to fix things. But the hardest thing
you’ll ever learn is when to <em>leave them broken</em>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>TL;DR: To make Anukari’s performance reliable across all Apple silicon macOS devices, I need to talk to someone on the Apple Metal team. It would be great if someone can connect me with the right person inside Apple, or direct them to my feedback request FB17475838 as well as this devlog entry.</strong></p>
<p><em>This is going to be a VERY LONG HIGHLY TECHNICAL post, so either buckle your seatbelt or leave while you still can.</em></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://anukari.com/">Anukari 3D Physics Synthesizer</a> simulates a large spring-mass model in real-time for audio generation. To support a nontrivial number of physics objects, it requires a GPU for the simulation. The physics code is ALU-bound, not memory-bound. All mutable state in the simulation is stored in the GPU’s threadgroup memory, which is roughly equivalent to a manually-allocated L1 cache, so it is extremely fast.</p>
<p>The typical use-case for Anukari is running it as an AudioUnit (AU) or VST3 plugin inside a host application like Pro Tools or Ableton, also called a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). The DAW invokes Anukari for each audio buffer block, which is a request to generate/process N samples of audio. For each block, Anukari invokes the physics simulation GPU kernel, waits for the result, and returns.</p>
<p>The audio buffer block system is important because GPU kernel scheduling has a certain amount of latency overhead, and for real-time audio we have fixed time constraints. By amortizing the GPU scheduling latency over, say, 512 audio samples, it becomes negligible. But the runtime of the kernel itself is still very important.</p>
<h2>Basic Problem</h2>
<p>Apple’s macOS is obviously extremely clever about power management, and Apple silicon hardware is built to support the OS in achieving high power efficiency.</p>
<p>As with all modern hardware, the clock rate for Apple silicon chips can be slowed down to reduce power consumption. When the OS detects that the processing demand for a given chip is low (or non-existent), it can decrease the clock rate for that chip. This is awesome.</p>
<p>The problem is that due to the way Anukari runs inside a DAW and interacts with the GPU, the heuristics that macOS uses to determine whether there is sufficient demand upon the GPU to increase its clock rate do not work.</p>
<p>Consider the chart below. The CPU does some preparatory work, there’s a small gap which represents kernel invocation latency, and then the GPU does a large block of work. Finally there’s another small gap representing the real-time headroom.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.anukari.com/blog-media/cpu-gpu-time-sequence.jpg"></p><p><em>(An aside: chalkboards are way better than whiteboards, unless you enjoy getting high on noxious fumes. in which case whiteboards are the way to go.)</em></p>
<p>I don’t have any real knowledge of macOS’s heuristics for deciding when to increase the GPU clock speed, but I might reasonably guess that it relies on something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_(computing)">load average</a>. In the diagram above, the GPU load average might be only 60%, because between audio buffer blocks it is idle. Perhaps this does not meet the threshold for increasing the GPU clock rate.</p>
<p>But this is terrible for Anukari, because to meet real-time constraints, it needs the absolute lowest latency possible, which requires the highest GPU clock rate. I’m not sure how low the Apple GPU clock rate can go, but it definitely goes low enough to make Anukari unusable.</p>
<p>To be clear, it’s pretty understandable that macOS handles this situation poorly, because the GPU is mostly used for throughput workflows like graphics or ML. Audio on the GPU is really new, and there are only a couple of companies doing it right now.</p>
<h2>Are you sure the clock rate is the problem?</h2>
<p><em>Oh yes.</em> Thankfully, Apple’s first-part Instruments tools that come with Xcode have a handy Metal profiler. Among other things, this is how I first learned that Anukari is ALU-bound.</p>
<p>The Metal profiler has an incredibly useful feature: it allows you to choose the Metal “Performance State” while profiling the application. This is not configurable outside of the profiler. This is how I first figured out that the GPU clock rate was the issue: Anukari works perfectly under the Maximum performance state, and abysmally under the Minimum performance state.</p>
<h2>Wait, Anukari mostly works great on macOS. How is that possible?</h2>
<p>Given the explanation above, this is a great question. Most people with macOS find that Anukari works great. For example, I intentionally bought a base-model Macbook M1 for development, so that if Anukari worked well for me, I’d know it worked well for people with beefier hardware.</p>
<p>So how is it that Anukari works great on macOS for most people? Well, as Steve Jobs said, “It’s better to be a pirate than to join the Navy.”</p>
<p>Without being able to rely on macOS to do the right thing, I thought like a pirate and came up with a workaround: in parallel with the audio computation on the GPU, Anukari runs a second workload on the GPU that is designed to create a high load average and trick macOS into clocking up the GPU. This workload is tuned to use as little of the GPU as possible, while still creating a big enough artificial load to trigger the clock heuristics.</p>
<p>In other words, it runs a spin loop to heat up the GPU. On my Macbook M1, this completely solves the issue. Anukari runs completely reliably. I called this strategy “waste makes haste” and it is documented in detail on my devlog <a href="https://anukari.com/blog/devlog/waste-makes-haste">here</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, the spin loop is an unholy abomination and I hate that it’s necessary. But it is absolutely required for Anukari to work well for macOS users. And for most macOS users, it works great.</p>
<h2>So with the “waste makes haste” strategy, what’s the problem?</h2>
<p>Like I said, on my M1 things work perfectly. But then I released the Anukari Beta and some macOS users are having problems. What’s different?</p>
<p>First: I’m not certain. But I have a couple hypotheses.</p>
<p>Weirdly, it appears that most users with performance issues are using Pro or Max Apple hardware. These have additional GPU chiplets. I am completely speculating here, but Apple’s hardware is amazing so it stands to reason that each GPU chiplets's clock rate can be changed independently. Do you see where this is going?</p>
<p>If macOS is really smart, it should see that Anukari is running two independent GPU workloads: the physics kernel, and the spin kernel. Why not run those on separate GPU chiplets? That’s smart. And then, if I’m right that the GPU chiplets have independent clock rates, well, Anukari is hosed because the stupid spin workload will get a fast-clock GPU and the audio workload will get a slow-clock GPU.</p>
<p>I could be wrong. Another possibility is that the GPU has a single clock rate, and my spin workload is too conservative to convince the much more powerful GPU to clock up. Maybe my spin kernel can heat up an M1 GPU but not an M4 Pro GPU, because the M4 Pro is faster.</p>
<h2>What do you think macOS should do to fix this?</h2>
<p>Apple engineers will obviously know better than I do here, but I’ll present a couple of obvious possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Solution 1:</strong> On macOS, audio processing is done on a thread (or group of threads) called an Audio Workgroup. These are explained in Apple’s documentation <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/audiotoolbox/understanding-audio-workgroups?language=objc">here</a>. Within an Audio Workgroup, the OS understands that the threads have real-time constraints, and prioritizes those threads appropriately. This is actually a fantastic innovation, because before Audio Workgroups, it wasn’t really possible to do real-time audio processing safely across multiple threads without problems like priority inversion, etc.</p>
<p>The Audio Workgroup concept could be extended to cover processing on the GPU. Any MTLCommandQueue managed by an Audio Workgroup thread could be treated as real-time and the GPU clock could be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Solution 2:</strong> The Metal API could simply provide an option on MTLCommandQueue to indicate that it is real-time sensitive, and the clock for the GPU chiplet handling that queue could be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Solution 3:</strong> Someone could point out that I'm an idiot and there's already some way to get what I want, and this whole post was a waste of my time. This would be wonderful.</p>
<h2>Wouldn’t Apple’s new Game Mode help?</h2>
<p>Game Mode certainly seems similar to what Anukari needs. However, Game Mode is at the process-level, and Anukari is mostly used as a plugin inside other processes, which don’t support Game Mode, and anyway Anukari has no control. Also Anukari is usually not fullscreen, which Game Mode requires.</p>
<h2>What about Windows performance?</h2>
<p>Not a problem at all. I don’t know if it’s because Windows gives users more control over their system’s performance state, or if e.g. NVIDIA drivers are less careful about power consumption, or what. But the spin loop is not necessary on Windows.</p>
<p>It's not a great look for Apple that a Windows PC with a pretty wimpy GPU can run Anukari just fine, and the most expensive Mac M4 Max stutters, because obviously Apple's hardware is <em>incredible</em> and just needs to be let off the leash a bit.</p>
<h2>Why don’t you just pipeline the GPU code so that it saturates the GPU?</h2>
<p>For a throughput workload, this is exactly what I’d do. But Anukari is not throughput-sensitive, it is latency-sensitive.</p>
<p>The idea with pipelining is that maybe Anukari could schedule multiple physics simulation kernels in advance, so that the GPU could be processing the current audio sample block at the same time that the CPU is preparing the next block for the GPU. (This would also alleviate the kernel invocation latency overhead, but that’s not as important.)</p>
<p>But anyone who understands pipelining knows that it increases throughput at the cost of latency. Anukari processes audio in real-time, so each kernel invocation needs access to the real-time audio input data (e.g. from the microphone). Thus Anukari can’t do something like speculative execution where it processes the next audio block early, because it wouldn’t have the input data required to do so.</p>
<h2>Why don’t you run the spin kernel in the same MTLCommandQueue as the physics kernel?</h2>
<p>This solution might fix the problem where the spin and physics kernels end up running on separate GPU chiplets (if that is indeed the issue).</p>
<p>I <em>have</em> tried this, actually. The reason it doesn’t work is again because Anukari is latency-sensitive. What happens is that sometimes the spin kernel runs a little too long and cuts into the time for running the physics kernel. I experimented with small spin kernels, using volatile unified memory to allow the CPU to write an “exit kernel early” flag. Even with these hijinx, sometimes the spin kernel cut into physics kernel time.</p>
<h2>Why not just make the GPU code more efficient?</h2>
<p>Because the simulation is ALU-bound, there’s not much performance to be gained from the typical optimization low-hanging fruit: improving memory access patterns. To speed up Anukari’s physics kernel, the only thing that really helps is optimizing arithmetic throughput. For example, Anukari uses FP16 math where possible to better-saturate Apple’s ALUs. Instructions have been reordered using micro-benchmarks. All physics state is in L1 memory. Loads are reordered for vectorization. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Anukari heavily exploits the fact that threads within Apple’s SIMD-groups (roughly) share an instruction pointer. Different physics objects have highly divergent code branch paths, so simulating two types of objects within a SIMD-group is slow due to the requirement for instruction masking while the top-level branch paths are executed serially. To avoid this, Anukari dynamically optimizes the memory layout of physics objects to minimize the number of object types executed within each SIMD-group. This optimization is <a href="https://anukari.com/blog/devlog/the-new-warp-alignment-optimizer">described here in great detail</a>, and is a massive performance win.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say is that I have <em>bent over backwards</em> to squeeze every last drop of performance out of Apple's hardware. It's been fun to do!</p>
<p>There are further arithmetic optimizations to be done, but they will be fairly marginal. We’re talking single-digit percentage point speedups. Anukari’s GPU code is already VERY FAST. If you’re curious, there’s more info on Anukari’s optimizations <a href="https://anukari.com/blog/devlog/tags/optimization">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Why use the GPU at all?</h2>
<p>On powerful machines, Anukari can simulate 768 - 1024 physics objects. Each object can be arbitrarily connected to other objects, meaning that they influence one another. Each object has to be stepped forward in an implicit Euler integration at the audio sample rate, typically 48,000 samples per second. Each object has somewhere between 3 and 10 parameters that affect its behavior. Some of the behaviors involve expensive math, like vector rotation, exp(), log(), etc.</p>
<p>This is simply not even close to feasible on the CPU! Trust me, I tried. It’s not even a little bit close. The GPU just has a ridiculous number of ALUs, it gives me explicit control over the L1 cache layout, and the concurrency constructs like threadgroup_barrier allow the physics integration steps to be done massively in parallel without consistency issues, without expensive CPU mutexes.</p>
<p>I’ll say it again: Anukari does not exist without GPU processing.</p>
<h2>Why should Apple care about what Anukari needs?</h2>
<p>Maybe they shouldn’t, I don’t know. Anukari is a tiny startup. It’s a niche product. It’s doing something weird.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the people who like Anukari really like it. Mick Gordon, the composer for IMO the greatest DOOM games of all time, randomly showed up and blew everyone away with an <a href="https://x.com/Mick_Gordon/status/1918146487948919222">incredible demo using Anukari</a>. Anukari is receiving praise from people who really love synthesizers like <a href="https://cdm.link/anukari-physics-based-instrument/">CDM</a>. Comments have appeared on random internet threads that I didn't start, like, <em>"it's the most creative plugin I've tried in the last 10 years.</em></p>
<p>But mostly, Anukari is using Apple’s hardware in what I consider an incredibly cool way, allowing users to do something that they’ve never been able to do before. And Apple’s hardware is completely up to the task. But it just needs a little push in the right direction.</p>
<h2>Why don’t you use GPU Audio’s APIs?</h2>
<p>I don’t really want to include this last question, but it is here to address the fact that the CEO of GPU Audio, Alexander Talashov, likes to drive by threads about Anukari and suggest that if Anukari used his APIs it would solve our problems. I would be so happy if this were true.</p>
<p>Alexander is a great guy, and his product (<a href="https://www.gpu.audio/">GPU Audio</a>) is a great product. I’ve met him in person, and he’s incredibly passionate about making the GPU accessible for DSP. Audio folks should check it out, it’s really cool. I wish GPU Audio huge success, and support their product.</p>
<p>But… GPU Audio has nothing useful for Anukari. Fundamentally the problem is that Anukari is not anything like a traditional DSP application. It’s a numerical differential equation integrator, far more similar to a video game physics engine than a DSP application. Sure, there are bits and bobs of DSP inside the physics engine, for example Anukari’s mics in the physics world do have compression, and that’s done in-line with the physics calculations on the GPU. But the vast majority of computation is Eulerian integration.</p>
<p>It needs to be understood that I’m programming the GPU at the bare Metal layer (yes pun intended), and am taking advantage of a number of hardware features and ridiculous domain-specific optimizations that are quite necessary to make this work. <em>And all I need is for Apple to reliably turn up the clock rate on the GPU.</em></p>

		<p><em>Republished by <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/05/13/don_t_use_gmail_here_s_how_to_determine_how_many_of_your_emails_google_may.html">Slate</a>.

<p>For almost 15 years, I have run my own email server which I use for all of my non-work correspondence. I do so to keep <a href="http://autonomo.us/">autonomy</a>, control, and privacy over my email and so that no big company has copies of all of my personal email.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I was surprised to find out that my friend <a href="https://www.eff.org/about/staff/peter-eckersley">Peter Eckersley</a> — a very privacy conscious person who is Technology Projects Director at the <a href="https://eff.org/">EFF</a> — used Gmail. I asked him why he would willingly give Google copies of all his email. Peter pointed out that if all of your friends use Gmail, Google has your email anyway. Any time I email somebody who uses Gmail — and anytime they email me — Google has that email.</p>
<p>Since our conversation, I have often wondered just how much of my email Google really has. This weekend, I wrote a small program to go through all the email I have kept in my personal inbox since April 2004 (when Gmail was started) to find out.</p>
<p>One challenge with answering the question is that many people, like Peter, use Gmail to read, compose, and send email but they configure Gmail to send email from a non-<tt>gmail.com</tt> “From” address. To catch these, my program looks through each message’s headers that record which computers handled the message on its way to my server and to pick out messages that have traveled through <tt>google.com</tt>, <tt>gmail.com</tt>, or <tt>googlemail.com</tt>. Although I usually filter them, my personal mailbox contains emails sent through a number of mailing lists. Since these mailing lists often “hide” the true provenance of a message, I exclude all messages that are marked as coming from lists using the (usually invisible) “Precedence” header.</p>
<p>The following graph shows the numbers of emails in my personal inbox each week in red and the subset from Google in blue. Because the number of emails I receive week-to-week tends to vary quite a bit, I’ve included a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOESS">LOESS</a> “smoother” which shows a moving average over several weeks.</p>
<p><a href="https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/emails_gmail_over_time.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/emails_gmail_over_time.png" alt="Emails, total and from GMail, over time" width="720" height="432"></a>From eyeballing the graph, the answer to seems to be that, although it varies, about a third of the email in my inbox comes from Google!</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is all of my personal email and includes automatic and computer generated mail from banks and retailers, etc. Although it is true that Google doesn’t have these messages, it suggests that the proportion of my truly “personal” email that comes via Google is probably much higher.</p>
<p>I would also like to know how much of the email I send goes <em>to</em> Google. I can do this by looking at emails in my inbox that I have replied to. This works if I am willing to assume that if I reply to an email sent from Google, it ends up back at Google. In some ways, doing this addresses the problem with the emails from retailers and banks since I am very unlikely to reply to those emails. In this sense, it also reflects a measure of more truly personal email.</p>
<p>I’ve broken down the proportions of emails I received that come from Google in the graph below for all email (top) and for emails I have replied to (bottom). In the graphs, the size of the dots represents the total number of emails counted to make that proportion. Once again, I’ve included the LOESS moving average.</p>
<p><a href="https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/emails_gmail_prop_over_time.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/emails_gmail_prop_over_time.png" alt="Proportion of emails from GMail over time" width="720" height="576"></a>The answer is surprisingly large. Despite the fact that I spend hundreds of dollars a year and hours of work to host my own email server, Google has about half of my personal email! Last year, Google delivered 57% of the emails in my inbox that I replied to. They have delivered more than a third of all the email I’ve replied to every year since 2006 and more than half since 2010. On the upside, there is some indication that the proportion is going down. So far this year, only 51% of the emails I’ve replied to arrived from Google.</p>
<p>The numbers are higher than I imagined and reflect somewhat depressing news. They show how it’s complicated to think about privacy and autonomy for communication between parties. I’m not sure what to do except encourage others to consider, in the wake of the Snowden revelations and everything else, whether you really want Google to have all your email. And half of mine.</p>
<p>If you want to run the analysis on your own, you’re welcome to <a href="http://projects.mako.cc/source/?p=gmail-maildir-counter">the Python and R code I used to produce the numbers and graphs</a>.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>GPUs are the most popular platform for accelerating HPC workloads, such as artificial intelligence and science simulations. However, most microarchitectural research in academia relies on GPU core pipeline designs based on architectures that are more than 15 years old.
<br>This paper reverse engineers modern NVIDIA GPU cores, unveiling many key aspects of its design and explaining how GPUs leverage hardware-compiler techniques where the compiler guides hardware during execution. In particular, it reveals how the issue logic works including the policy of the issue scheduler, the structure of the register file and its associated cache, and multiple features of the memory pipeline. Moreover, it analyses how a simple instruction prefetcher based on a stream buffer fits well with modern NVIDIA GPUs and is likely to be used. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the register file cache and the number of register file read ports on both simulation accuracy and performance.
<br>By modeling all these new discovered microarchitectural details, we achieve 18.24% lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in execution cycles than previous state-of-the-art simulators, resulting in an average of 13.98% MAPE with respect to real hardware (NVIDIA RTX A6000). Also, we demonstrate that this new model stands for other NVIDIA architectures, such as Turing. Finally, we show that the software-based dependence management mechanism included in modern NVIDIA GPUs outperforms a hardware mechanism based on scoreboards in terms of performance and area.
