            <p>We are no strangers to Big Tech platforms occasionally <a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/facebook-ban-fiasco/">reprimanding us</a> for posting Linux and homelab content. YouTube and Facebook have done it. The pattern is familiar. Content gets flagged or removed. Platforms offer little explanation.</p><p>And when that happens, there is rarely any recourse for creators.</p><p>Now, a popular tech YouTuber, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CyberCPU?ref=news.itsfoss.com">CyberCPU Tech</a>, has faced the same treatment. This time, their entire channel was at risk.</p><h2 id="youtubes-high-handedness-on-display">YouTube's High-Handedness on Display</h2><figure><img src="https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/2025/11/cybercpu-tech-youtube-video-takedown-notice.jpeg" alt="a bearded man (the host of cybercpu tech) is sat on a desk on the left, pointing at youtube's reasoning behind the strike on his channel" loading="lazy" width="1552" height="943" srcset="https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/11/cybercpu-tech-youtube-video-takedown-notice.jpeg 600w, https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/11/cybercpu-tech-youtube-video-takedown-notice.jpeg 1000w, https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/2025/11/cybercpu-tech-youtube-video-takedown-notice.jpeg 1552w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em>Source: </em></i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6p6g0-JUNA&amp;ref=news.itsfoss.com"><i><em>CyberCPU Tech</em></i></a></figcaption></figure><p>Two weeks ago, Rich had posted a video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U7IyQQ-puQ&amp;ref=news.itsfoss.com">installing Windows 11 25H2 with a local account</a>. YouTube removed it, saying that it was "<em>encouraging dangerous or illegal activities that risk serious physical harm or death</em>."</p><p>Days later, Rich posted another video showing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCBVSTNNAgo&amp;ref=news.itsfoss.com">how to bypass Windows 11's hardware requirements</a> to install the OS on unsupported systems. YouTube took that down too.</p><p><strong>Both videos received community guidelines strikes.</strong> Rich appealed both immediately. The first appeal was denied in 45 minutes. The second in just five.</p><p>Rich initially suspected overzealous AI moderation was behind the takedowns. Later, he wondered if Microsoft was somehow involved. Without clear answers from YouTube, it was all guesswork.</p><p>Then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxwYXNl5bGA&amp;ref=news.itsfoss.com">came the twist</a>. <strong>YouTube eventually restored both videos</strong>. The platform claimed its "<em>initial actions</em>" (<em>could be either the first takedown or appeal denial, or both</em>) were not the result of automation.</p><p>Now, if you have an all-organic, nature-given brain inside your head (<em>yes, I am not counting the </em><a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077_Cyberware?ref=news.itsfoss.com"><em>cyberware</em></a><em>-equipped peeps in the house</em>). Then you can easily see the problem.</p><p>If humans reviewed these videos, how did YouTube conclude that these Windows tutorials posed "<em>risk of death</em>"?</p><p>This incident highlights how <strong>automated moderation systems struggle to distinguish legitimate content from harmful material</strong>. These systems lack context. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Big Tech</a> companies pour billions into AI. Yet their moderation tools flag harmless tutorials as life-threatening content. Another recent instance is the removal of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Endermanch?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Enderman</a>'s personal channel.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v32gdnhAlFI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="My channel is getting terminated"></iframe></figure><p>Meanwhile, actual spam slips through unnoticed.

president and core developer with this European award for his long-term
dedication to the project. What began as a student initiative has,
through his continuous effort, evolved into one of the most widely used
media players, with billion of users worldwide.</p><figure><img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/68/bb/19908b5778f4dbc90c2c4b36d90b.jpg" alt=" SFSCON participants posing for a photo with the European SFS Award winner, the president of VLC. There is a traffic cone and a plaque with the VLC media player logo"><figcaption>Picture by NOI Techpark - Marco Parisi CC-BY-SA 4.0. </figcaption></figure><p>The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), together with the Linux
User Group Bolzano‑Bozen (LUGBZ), is proud to recognize Jean-Baptiste
Kempf with the European SFS Award 2025, in recognition of his
outstanding and lasting contributions to the Free Software movement and
his long-term dedication to the VLC project.</p><p>Born as a student project in 1996, this software has evolved into an
essential, all-in-one media player that plays almost anything
effortlessly. Originally a simple network streaming client, it has grown
into a powerful universal media player that continues to evolve and
impress. </p><p>“For many people running non-free operating systems, it was the very
first Free Software they ever installed. For many people running Free
Software, it saved them from installing and booting into a proprietary
operating system”, declared Matthias Kirschner, president of the FSFE
during the Award ceremony. </p><p>Jean-Baptiste Kempf joined the project as a student, and when it
faced the risk of dying after the graduation of its original developers,
he took the reins. With the help of other core developers, he
transformed it into the indispensable media player we rely on today.</p><p>Over the years, Kempf has become not only the president of the
VideoLAN non-profit but also one of the lead developers of VLC Media
Player and the founder of VideoLabs. “It’s small, fast, friendly, and
seems to "understand everything you throw at it. I have always thought
of it as "the program that eats everything", said Raphael Barbieri, a
member of LUGBZ, during the winner’s announcement. </p><blockquote>"I am extremely honoured to receive the European SFS Award. The Free
Software multimedia community is quite niche and unknown, but we work
hard so that video content can be free, can be played and processed. The
work done around the VideoLAN community has been tremendous, despite its
little resources. I want to thank the whole VideoLAN and FFmpeg teams,
who spend their time on those projects, often with little recognition", <cite>
declares Jean-Baptiste Kemp</cite>.</blockquote><h3 id="id-the-european-sfs-award">The European SFS Award</h3><p>The European SFS Award recognizes individuals whose work has made a         
significant and sustained difference in advancing Free Software across
Europe. Since 2023 it is presented jointly by LUGBZ and the FSFE and      
honours those whose efforts strengthen software freedom, community      
building, and the ethical foundations of technology.</p><p>In previous years, the award was given to <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2023/news-20231110-01.en.html">Frank
Karlitschek (2023) for his leadership with Nextcloud</a>, and
posthumously to <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2024/news-20241108-01.en.html">Bram
Moolenaar (2024) for creating the Vim editor</a>.</p><h3 id="id-2025-laudatio">2025 Laudatio</h3><p><strong><strong>Raphael: </strong></strong>There’s a program most of
us have used - on laptops, phones, tablets or desktops computers. It
might have run on screens in supermarkets or shops. It’s small, fast,
friendly, and seems to "understand everything you throw at it". I have
always thought of it as "the program that eats everything."</p><p><strong><strong>Matthias: </strong></strong>This amazing software did
not come from a giant technology company with a huge budget. It began
more than twenty years ago - as a modest experiment by a few students at
an engineering school. They wanted to solve a problem they identified.
Nothing fancy - just a student project to tinker, experiment, share, and
have fun. No one knew that those first lines of code written for
“network 2000” would one day reach billions of users.</p><p><strong><strong>Raphael: </strong></strong>Like many student
projects, it almost faded away when graduation came and the contributors
had other priorities. But one young engineer, who had joined the group
in 2000, refused to let it die. He reorganised the code, inspired new
contributors, and slowly turned a university experiment into a
world-class piece of software. </p><p><strong><strong>Matthias: </strong></strong>He built a healthy
community fostering the software. Hundreds of volunteers joined. They
contributed by programming, testing, auditing, helping others, with
translations, improving the design, or promoting the software. Thereby
the community grew and people started using the software on every
platform – GNU/Linux and other Unix like operating systems, Windows,
Android, or MacOS and iOS. For many people running non-free operating
systems, it was the very first Free Software they ever installed. For
many people running Free Software, it saved them from installing and
booting into a proprietary operating system.</p><p><strong><strong>Raphael: </strong></strong>With this success our
winner was offered tempting deals - big money, advertising, corporate
buyouts. Every time, he gently said no. Because it was not about
maximising profit. It was about maximising freedom for computer
users.</p><p><strong><strong>Matthias: </strong></strong>To protect that freedom,
he later founded a non-profit organisation - so the software would
always belong to its community. He also founded a company to support the
technical side - keeping development professional while staying true to
the values of software freedom. Under his leadership, the initiative has
reached billions of downloads, maintained and added amazing features -
all without losing its soul.</p><p><strong><strong>Raphael: </strong></strong>And there’s another thing
this community is famous for - its sense of humour. Their symbol? A
bright orange-and-white traffic cone. Legend has it that the original
students used to collect these cones after late nights out. When it came
time to pick a logo, they chose it proudly - a playful symbol of
creativity, chaos, and collaboration.</p><p><strong><strong>Matthias: </strong></strong>Nowadays, that little
cone has become an icon you find on a huge amount of computers
worldwide. At conferences their contributors wear the cones on their
heads with pride as a clear sign of who they are and what they stand
for.</p><p><strong><strong>Raphael: </strong></strong>And the person behind it?
He’s not just a brilliant engineer. He’s a leader, a mentor, and a true
advocate for software freedom. In 2018, his contributions were honoured
with the title of <strong><strong>Chevalier de l’Ordre National du
Mérite</strong></strong> - the first Free Software developer ever to
receive that distinction. Yes - a real knight of software freedom.</p><p><strong><strong>Matthias: </strong></strong>His “Holy Grail” was not
fame or fortune - it’s <em><em>freedom</em></em>: the freedom for
billions of people to watch, listen, and share multimedia files without
restrictions or surveillance. He has shown the world that integrity,
community, and a bit of humour can change how we experience digital
media.</p><p><strong><strong>Raphael: </strong></strong>Today, we celebrate
someone who has made it possible for all of us to enjoy open, universal
access to media - and who continues to prove that Free Software is
powerful, beautiful, and fun.</p><p><strong><strong>Matthias: </strong></strong>It is our great pleasure
to present the <strong><strong>European SFS Award 2025</strong></strong>
to the president of the VideoLAN non-profit, one of the lead developers
of VLC media player, the founder of VideoLabs, the bearer of the traffic
cone, and a true knight of Free Software....</p><p><strong><strong>Matthias &amp; Raphael: Jean-Baptiste

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							
<p>You can fault Tim Cook for a number of things. Number one on the list, of course, is that he is not Steve Jobs. The nerve of that man!</p>



<p>What made Steve an effective and visionary leader was that his values were so crystal clear. He inspired Apple’s troops to excel in innovation, design and simplicity.</p>



<p>But he was also passionate about something that seems almost “old school”—the customer experience. Creating the best experience would lure new customers and build brand loyalty.</p>



<p>This is how Steve laid out his plan to us at the ad agency when he returned to a nearly bankrupt Apple in the late 1990s. The customer experience was all-important.</p>



<p>From that point on, Steve would go on to spend lavishly on things that improved the experience, and he would reject—often brutally—any idea that diluted or harmed the experience.</p>



<p>That was Steve’s red line. Cross it if you dare.</p>



<p>And what is the status of that distinct red line today? Sadly, it’s getting a bit blurry.</p>



<p>Recent reports say that we will soon be seeing ads in Apple Maps. Just as we saw ads appear in the App Store in 2015 and get&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/apple-expands-its-ad-business-with-a-new-app-store-ad-slot/">amped up</a>&nbsp;in 2021.</p>



<p>I’ll go out on a limb and say that uninvited advertising is not normally equated with a better customer experience. Why would Apple do such a thing?</p>



<p>Shocker—it’s about money. One can only imagine how eyes lit up in the Apple boardroom as they celebrated a new revenue stream.</p>



<p>Who knows how, or even if, these ads register with Apple users as they become more visible. After all, ads are all around us today, everywhere we go. Still, many will shake their heads in disappointment that Apple—one of the richest companies on earth—is selling a piece of its soul for a bit of easy money.</p>



<h2><strong>What would Steve Jobs do?</strong></h2>



<p>I usually dodge that question on the grounds that it’s pure speculation. However, in this case, it is not speculation at all. I was in the room when Steve was presented with an eerily similar “opportunity.”</p>



<p>Here’s what happened.</p>



<p>Some time ago (1999-ish), agency chief Lee Clow and I were invited to a hastily scheduled meeting with Steve and his top lieutenants. The topic was building advertising into the Mac system software.</p>



<p>At that time, customers paid $125 for the annual upgrade to the Mac OS. It was proposed that Apple offer two flavors—an ad-free version for $125 and a free version subsidized by ads. Something for everyone! Free choice!</p>



<p>A number of ways to integrate ads were discussed.</p>



<p>One was to show a cool video from a respected company (such as Nike) every time the Mac starts up. Another was to place ads in the OS contextually. For example, an “out of ink” notification might contain an ad for an ink supplier.</p>



<p>After spirited debate, there was no immediate decision. But days later, Steve told me he had killed the idea. His bottom line was that it degraded the pure, elegant, clean interface that Mac users love.</p>



<p>It didn’t matter that customers would be free to choose a version with or without ads. He didn’t want&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;user to see the OS polluted in this way.</p>



<p>He was protecting Apple’s crown jewels. He wouldn’t sacrifice the purity of the Mac experience to make a few extra bucks. He avoided the slippery slope by refusing to step onto it.</p>



<p>All hail the red line!</p>



<p>Now, fast-forward to the present. Apple’s evolution tells us that red lines do not magically live forever. They exist only as long as company leaders want them to exist. Without proper maintenance, they begin to disappear.</p>



<p>Whatever his reason, Tim Cook is not as protective of the user experience as his predecessor was. If we were to ask Tim why it’s okay to bring ads into Apple products now, but wasn’t okay during Steve’s reign, the best (only?) answer would probably be, “Today’s Apple is very different from Steve’s Apple.”</p>



<p>Quite true. And that is exactly the problem.</p>

The topics range greatly: some folks are just getting started and others are asking very specific, advanced questions.</p><p>This month we covered everything from registering bridge components to native vs. web-based tabs to authenticating Apple Watch apps! It’s really fun to see what folks are working on in the Hotwire Native space.</p><p><span>During the session I shared some code I wrote to figure out what </span><em>version</em><span> a Hotwire Native app is running. The app sends the version in the user agent (e.g. </span><code>v1.2.3</code><span>) and then I parse it with the following Ruby class on the server:</span></p><pre><code>class AppVersion
  include Comparable

  attr_reader :major, :minor, :patch

  def initialize(version_string)
    parts = version_string.to_s.split(”.”).map(&amp;:to_i)
    @major, @minor, @patch = parts[0] || 0, parts[1] || 0, parts[2] || 0
  end

  def &lt;=&gt;(other)
    [major, minor, patch] &lt;=&gt; [other.major, other.minor, other.patch]
  end

  def to_s
    “#{major}.#{minor}.#{patch}”
  end
end</code></pre><p>And it works great! I use this throughout my apps to feature flag code based on which version the app is running.</p><p><strong>But someone brought up something even better: </strong><code>Gem::Version</code><strong><span>. </span><a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.1/Gem/Version.html" rel="">This class</a><span> accomplishes the same goal: “process string versions into comparable values”.</span></strong></p><pre><code>irb(main)&gt; Gem::Version.new("1.2.3") &gt; Gem::Version.new("1.2.2")
=&gt; true

irb(main)&gt; Gem::Version.new("2.0") &gt; Gem::Version.new("1.2.2")
=&gt; true</code></pre><p><span>It can even compare </span><em>prerelease</em><span> versions, like alphas or betas.</span></p><pre><code>irb(main)&gt; Gem::Version.new("2.0.b1") &gt; Gem::Version.new("1.9")
=&gt; true
irb(main)&gt; Gem::Version.new("2.0") &gt; Gem::Version.new("2.0.b1")
=&gt; true</code></pre><p><span>The big advantage this class has over my implementation is that </span><strong>it’s built into Ruby!</strong></p><p><span>It’s not even a Rails dependency but part of the standard Ruby library. Internally, this class is used to compare version numbers when parsing your </span><code>Gemfile</code><span>. Check out </span><a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.1/Gem/Version.html" rel="">the documentation</a><span>, I picked up a few things on semantic versioning when reading it.</span></p><p><span>I’ve already replaced my </span><code>AppVersion</code><span> class with </span><code>Gem::Version</code><span>. But it makes me wonder what other Ruby/Rails features I </span><em>don’t</em><span> know about and am implementing on my own!</span></p><p><span>I never would have learned about </span><code>Gem::Version</code><span> if it wasn’t for someone bringing it up during office hours. I’d still be using my custom (and most likely buggy!) </span><code>AppVersion</code><span> implementation…&nbsp;like a chump. 😅</span></p><p><span>But seriously, this is why I </span><em>love</em><span> connecting with folks in the Ruby/Rails community. Every time I go to an event, host a workshop, give a talk…&nbsp;I learn something new. Sometimes it’s small things like </span><code>Gem::Version</code><span>. Other times it completely changes my career, like the first time I heard about Hotwire Native.</span></p><p><span>I’ve taken this to heart and recently started organizing monthly </span><em>Coffee and Code</em><span> coworking sessions in my city, Portland, OR. Every month I post up at a local coffee shop with my laptop and invite all of the </span><a href="https://pdxruby.org/" rel="">Portland Ruby Brigade</a><span> to join.</span></p><p>This month we had five people! It’s no corporate-sponsored-meetup but it sure is something. And the connections that folks are making during these casual events are real. I’ve already seen folks exchange emails for potential future contract gigs.</p><p><span>What’s the first step you can take </span><em>today</em><span> to build some community in your local area? Even if it is just finally inviting that connection-to-be for a beverage… I say go for it.</span></p><p>If you want to join next month’s office hours then consider becoming a paid subscriber of my newsletter. I hope to see you there! 👋</p><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><a href="https://newsletter.masilotti.com/p/office-hours" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><h2>Hotwire Native Office Hours</h2></a><div><div><a href="https://newsletter.masilotti.com/p/office-hours" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z9wc!,w_280,h_280,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1475c5dd-6c17-4d31-a80f-cf975c7cfcc7_4032x2565.jpeg"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z9wc!,w_280,h_280,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1475c5dd-6c17-4d31-a80f-cf975c7cfcc7_4032x2565.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="Hotwire Native Office Hours" width="280" height="280"></picture></a></div><div><p>Every month I host an hour-long Zoom session for Hotwire Native developers to ask questions, share progress, and connect with others building the same way.</p></div></div></div></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Do you ever feel like your font treats symbols as second-class glyphs? Are you frustrated that <code>-&gt;</code> looks nothing like an arrow, and <code>$</code>, <code>@</code>, <code>%</code> seem ever mismatched?</p>
<p dir="auto">Want to experience the beauty of ligatures without losing the simplicity of ASCII?</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Myna</strong> (<em>Gracula religiosa</em> 🐦‍⬛) is a monospace font which aims to bring harmony to your editor by treating symbols as first-class glyphs alongside alphanumeric characters.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Myna?</h2><a id="user-content-why-myna" aria-label="Permalink: Why Myna?" href="#why-myna"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Myna was borne out of a need to scratch a persistent typographical itch. While I've tried many otherwise well-crafted monospace fonts, I always found myself wanting to tweak a glyph here or adjust a shape there. After developing Myna and using it almost exclusively in my professional and personal work, I'm sharing it as a small contribution to the wonderful community of monospace typography enthusiasts.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here are a few of its attractive features that might make it your next favourite monospace font:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Symbol-First Design</strong>: clear emphasis on ASCII symbols which are ubiquitous in programming languages</li>
<li><strong>Near-Perfect Alignment</strong>: multi-character symbols like <code>-&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, <code>=~</code>, <code>::</code> align seamlessly</li>
<li><strong>Balanced Weight</strong>: symbols have just the right visual weight against your code</li>
<li><strong>Minimalist Forms</strong>: geometric shapes for quotes and commas</li>
<li><strong>Clear Distinction</strong>: no more confusing <code>1 l I |</code> or <code>0 O o</code></li>
<li><strong>Language-Aware Design</strong>: clean sigils for Perl + elegant operators for Haskell + clear symbols for C</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">NB: Myna is designed to be a simple font. The current release is a single weight without ligatures, though future updates may expand its features if demand arises. It does work out nicely with synthesised bold generated by fontconfig and pango on Linux.</p>

				<p>Hey everyone, R* Employee of many years here!
 


	&nbsp;
 


	Understandably I want to remain anonymous due to retaliation from the Company, but I may be willing to verify I'm an employee with @Spider-Vice via DM (if required). I am also a member of the Union.
 


	&nbsp;
 


	I've been reading a lot of the discussion on here and elsewhere about the firing of more than 34 of my colleagues last week (31 in the UK + 3 in Canada) and have seen a lot of disinformation and lies that are really concerning. Par</p><p>

<p>
	I mean, firing 30-40 people in one day, all of 'em part of a private trade union chat group on Discord, for "gross misconduct"?<br>
	Seems like a pretty clear case of blatant union busting.

<p>
	I think people are avoiding there cuz of either spoilers or they wanna avoid the yapping&nbsp;
</p>



<p>
	They're covering it up by saying it's because the people who got fired were leaking stuff and them being union members was coincidence. But, if they were really leaking stuff, where is the leaked materials?

	Hey everyone, R* Employee of many years here!
</p>



<p>
	Understandably I want to remain anonymous due to retaliation from the Company, but I may be willing to verify I'm an employee with @Spider-Vice via DM (if required). I am also a member of the Union.
</p>



<p>
	I've been reading a lot of the discussion on here and elsewhere about the firing of more than 34 of my colleagues last week (31 in the UK + 3 in Canada) and have seen a lot of disinformation and lies that are really concerning. Particularly concerning how so many folk are willing to believe the Company's excuses.
</p>



<p>
	Last week, my colleagues who were in the studio were each individually messaged by HR for a short friendly meeting, under the friendly guise of "Hey, are you free for a quick chat?"
</p>



<p>
	Upon attending this meeting they were handed an envelope with a short letter stating that their employment had been terminated for "gross misconduct" regarding posts made in Discord.
</p>



<p>
	They failed to provide any evidence when asked, nor was any stated in the letter. And did not divulge any other information or reasoning - "and no other reason"
</p>



<p>
	They refused their right to Union representation in the disciplinary meeting (which is against UK employment law) and were frogmarched out of the studio with the meeting lasting less than 5 minutes.
</p>



<p>
	For colleagues who were not in the Studio that day, they received a phone call from HR that lasted less than 2 minutes telling them they were fired and that they'd receive the same letter as above. I am aware of one employee who had a panic attack at this moment, and HR hung up on them during this panic attack not caring at all about their wellbeing.
</p>



<p>
	These colleagues of mine were hard workers who have spent many many years at R* in critical roles. With colleagues who have been at R* for more that 18 years and none of them have ever had a disciplinary in that time. They are not easily replaced and will certainly affect us in making our project deadlines.
</p>



<p>
	These are very senior artists, animators, QA testers, designers, programmers and producers. Including Leads. All super talented people who were proud of their work over multiple R* titles, and all they wanted was the best for R* and their fellow colleagues.
</p>



<p>
	Some of these members were off sick, recovering from surgery or on paternity leave. Fired without pay, losing their careers and putting them into hardship in the lead up to Christmas, and even potentially losing their VISAs to work in the UK.&nbsp;
</p>



<p>
	Let me make this clear! I never saw any discussion/leaking of Rockstar projects in the Union Discord. The only ever discussion was around unionisation efforts and the working conditions at R*. The Discord wasn't public. It was a private Discord group that only contained R* employees and the IWGB Union officials.
</p>



<p>
	This was Union Busting and nothing else! Everyone fired was a Union Member, they were also predominantly from those who were on the Union Organising Committees of each UK studio.
</p>



<p>
	Just one week before, the Union had reached ~200 members taking us over the 10% threshold required to seek recognition and begin engaging in collective bargaining. Allowing us to negotiate directly with management on the key issues that affect us: worsening crunch, inadequate pay and inflexible working arrangements.
</p>



<p>
	They have fired over 34 of us now. There were over 250 of us in that Union/Employee Discord group. There is the fear that if they get away with this, they'll have nothing stopping them from doing this again and again.
</p>

<p>
	Those of us who are lucky and remain for now work in fear! Fearful when talking to each other at the tea prep, fearful that we're next in line and are easily got rid of, too scared to go outside the studio and talk to (or even acknowledge) our colleagues outside protesting in fear of reprisals. Morale in the studio is at rock bottom. When we should be excited about what's to come over the next year we are now totally deflated and our trust and confidence in others is totally shot.
</p>



<p>
	Which is the truly heartbreaking part, as for us in the Union, all of our ambition was to make R* a happier, fairer, safer and more equitable place. That's all. What has happened clearly shows that we care more about the wellbeing of our colleagues at Rockstar than the Company does.
</p>



<p>
	The union remains unbowed and is fighting to win the reinstatement of every dismissed member of staff at Rockstar through legal means and campaigning.&nbsp;
</p>



<p>
	This fight is critical, if Rockstar can get away with this, they will keep treating their workers with disdain, disrespect, and subjecting them to continued illegal treatment.
</p>



<p>
	Thanks for your time, and I hope this is some truth that helps you all understand what's going on here at the moment.
</p>



<p>
	I you would be so kind, you can contribute to the fundraiser to support those fighting their dismissal here: <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-rockstar-workers-fighting-unfair-dismissals/" rel="external nofollow">https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-rockstar-workers-fighting-unfair-dismissals/ </a>
</p>



<p>
	It would be really appreciated if you could also share the above link. I won’t be cross posting this to other forums, but please feel free to share.
</p>



<p>
	Cheers x
</p>

	Kinda ironic I feel that a couple years ago or so we learned about R* making efforts to improve their work environment so as to avoid crunch and so on, and now they fire employees for wanting said environment to be even fairer and safer for them.
</p>



<p>
	Business as usual I guess...

			Hey everyone, R* Employee of many years here!
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Understandably I want to remain anonymous due to retaliation from the Company, but I may be willing to verify I'm an employee with @Spider-Vice via DM (if required). I am also a member of the Union.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			I've been reading a lot of the discussion on here and elsewhere about the firing of more than 34 of my colleagues last week (31 in the UK + 3 in Canada) and have seen a lot of disinformation and lies that are really concerning. Particularly concerning how so many folk are willing to believe the Company's excuses.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Last week, my colleagues who were in the studio were each individually messaged by HR for a short friendly meeting, under the friendly guise of "Hey, are you free for a quick chat?"
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Upon attending this meeting they were handed an envelope with a short letter stating that their employment had been terminated for "gross misconduct" regarding posts made in Discord.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			They failed to provide any evidence when asked, nor was any stated in the letter. And did not divulge any other information or reasoning - "and no other reason"
		</p>

		

		<p>
			They refused their right to Union representation in the disciplinary meeting (which is against UK employment law) and were frogmarched out of the studio with the meeting lasting less than 5 minutes.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			For colleagues who were not in the Studio that day, they received a phone call from HR that lasted less than 2 minutes telling them they were fired and that they'd receive the same letter as above. I am aware of one employee who had a panic attack at this moment, and HR hung up on them during this panic attack not caring at all about their wellbeing.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			These colleagues of mine were hard workers who have spent many many years at R* in critical roles. With colleagues who have been at R* for more that 18 years and none of them have ever had a disciplinary in that time. They are not easily replaced and will certainly affect us in making our project deadlines.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			These are very senior artists, animators, QA testers, designers, programmers and producers. Including Leads. All super talented people who were proud of their work over multiple R* titles, and all they wanted was the best for R* and their fellow colleagues.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Some of these members were off sick, recovering from surgery or on paternity leave. Fired without pay, losing their careers and putting them into hardship in the lead up to Christmas, and even potentially losing their VISAs to work in the UK.&nbsp;
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Let me make this clear! I never saw any discussion/leaking of Rockstar projects in the Union Discord. The only ever discussion was around unionisation efforts and the working conditions at R*. The Discord wasn't public. It was a private Discord group that only contained R* employees and the IWGB Union officials.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			This was Union Busting and nothing else! Everyone fired was a Union Member, they were also predominantly from those who were on the Union Organising Committees of each UK studio.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Just one week before, the Union had reached ~200 members taking us over the 10% threshold required to seek recognition and begin engaging in collective bargaining. Allowing us to negotiate directly with management on the key issues that affect us: worsening crunch, inadequate pay and inflexible working arrangements.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			They have fired over 34 of us now. There were over 250 of us in that Union/Employee Discord group. There is the fear that if they get away with this, they'll have nothing stopping them from doing this again and again.
		</p>

		<p>
			Those of us who are lucky and remain for now work in fear! Fearful when talking to each other at the tea prep, fearful that we're next in line and are easily got rid of, too scared to go outside the studio and talk to (or even acknowledge) our colleagues outside protesting in fear of reprisals. Morale in the studio is at rock bottom. When we should be excited about what's to come over the next year we are now totally deflated and our trust and confidence in others is totally shot.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Which is the truly heartbreaking part, as for us in the Union, all of our ambition was to make R* a happier, fairer, safer and more equitable place. That's all. What has happened clearly shows that we care more about the wellbeing of our colleagues at Rockstar than the Company does.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			The union remains unbowed and is fighting to win the reinstatement of every dismissed member of staff at Rockstar through legal means and campaigning.&nbsp;
		</p>

		

		<p>
			This fight is critical, if Rockstar can get away with this, they will keep treating their workers with disdain, disrespect, and subjecting them to continued illegal treatment.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Thanks for your time, and I hope this is some truth that helps you all understand what's going on here at the moment.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			I you would be so kind, you can contribute to the fundraiser to support those fighting their dismissal here: <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-rockstar-workers-fighting-unfair-dismissals/" rel="external nofollow">https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-rockstar-workers-fighting-unfair-dismissals/ </a>

	<div>
		<p>
			Hey everyone, R* Employee of many years here!
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Understandably I want to remain anonymous due to retaliation from the Company, but I may be willing to verify I'm an employee with @Spider-Vice via DM (if required). I am also a member of the Union.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			I've been reading a lot of the discussion on here and elsewhere about the firing of more than 34 of my colleagues last week (31 in the UK + 3 in Canada) and have seen a lot of disinformation and lies that are really concerning. Particularly concerning how so many folk are willing to believe the Company's excuses.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Last week, my colleagues who were in the studio were each individually messaged by HR for a short friendly meeting, under the friendly guise of "Hey, are you free for a quick chat?"
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Upon attending this meeting they were handed an envelope with a short letter stating that their employment had been terminated for "gross misconduct" regarding posts made in Discord.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			They failed to provide any evidence when asked, nor was any stated in the letter. And did not divulge any other information or reasoning - "and no other reason"
		</p>

		

		<p>
			They refused their right to Union representation in the disciplinary meeting (which is against UK employment law) and were frogmarched out of the studio with the meeting lasting less than 5 minutes.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			For colleagues who were not in the Studio that day, they received a phone call from HR that lasted less than 2 minutes telling them they were fired and that they'd receive the same letter as above. I am aware of one employee who had a panic attack at this moment, and HR hung up on them during this panic attack not caring at all about their wellbeing.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			These colleagues of mine were hard workers who have spent many many years at R* in critical roles. With colleagues who have been at R* for more that 18 years and none of them have ever had a disciplinary in that time. They are not easily replaced and will certainly affect us in making our project deadlines.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			These are very senior artists, animators, QA testers, designers, programmers and producers. Including Leads. All super talented people who were proud of their work over multiple R* titles, and all they wanted was the best for R* and their fellow colleagues.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Some of these members were off sick, recovering from surgery or on paternity leave. Fired without pay, losing their careers and putting them into hardship in the lead up to Christmas, and even potentially losing their VISAs to work in the UK.&nbsp;
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Let me make this clear! I never saw any discussion/leaking of Rockstar projects in the Union Discord. The only ever discussion was around unionisation efforts and the working conditions at R*. The Discord wasn't public. It was a private Discord group that only contained R* employees and the IWGB Union officials.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			This was Union Busting and nothing else! Everyone fired was a Union Member, they were also predominantly from those who were on the Union Organising Committees of each UK studio.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Just one week before, the Union had reached ~200 members taking us over the 10% threshold required to seek recognition and begin engaging in collective bargaining. Allowing us to negotiate directly with management on the key issues that affect us: worsening crunch, inadequate pay and inflexible working arrangements.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			They have fired over 34 of us now. There were over 250 of us in that Union/Employee Discord group. There is the fear that if they get away with this, they'll have nothing stopping them from doing this again and again.
		</p>

		<p>
			Those of us who are lucky and remain for now work in fear! Fearful when talking to each other at the tea prep, fearful that we're next in line and are easily got rid of, too scared to go outside the studio and talk to (or even acknowledge) our colleagues outside protesting in fear of reprisals. Morale in the studio is at rock bottom. When we should be excited about what's to come over the next year we are now totally deflated and our trust and confidence in others is totally shot.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Which is the truly heartbreaking part, as for us in the Union, all of our ambition was to make R* a happier, fairer, safer and more equitable place. That's all. What has happened clearly shows that we care more about the wellbeing of our colleagues at Rockstar than the Company does.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			The union remains unbowed and is fighting to win the reinstatement of every dismissed member of staff at Rockstar through legal means and campaigning.&nbsp;
		</p>

		

		<p>
			This fight is critical, if Rockstar can get away with this, they will keep treating their workers with disdain, disrespect, and subjecting them to continued illegal treatment.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Thanks for your time, and I hope this is some truth that helps you all understand what's going on here at the moment.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			I you would be so kind, you can contribute to the fundraiser to support those fighting their dismissal here: <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-rockstar-workers-fighting-unfair-dismissals/" rel="external nofollow">https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-rockstar-workers-fighting-unfair-dismissals/ </a>
		</p>

		

		<p>
			It would be really appreciated if you could also share the above link. I won’t be cross posting this to other forums, but please feel free to share.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Cheers x
		</p>

<p>
	Reading this made me sad and angry. I am very sorry for what happened to your colleagues, and for what the rest of you guys must be going through knowing that this could also happen to you guys. I really hope that you guys win this, because what Rockstar are doing is disgusting and unfair.

			Kinda ironic I feel that a couple years ago or so we learned about R* making efforts to improve their work environment so as to avoid crunch and so on, and now they fire employees for wanting said environment to be even fairer and safer for them.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Business as usual I guess...

<p>
	A lot of businesses have been getting comfy with going back to the "old ways" unfortunately, and it's awful that R*, who was seemingly making some strides to changing working conditions and improving the relationship with their workers, is now walking back on all of that. That's not how&nbsp; you motivate your employees to make what could be the biggest game of all time. Especially not one that's been delayed yet again.

		<p>
			Hey everyone, R* Employee of many years here!
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Understandably I want to remain anonymous due to retaliation from the Company, but I may be willing to verify I'm an employee with @Spider-Vice via DM (if required). I am also a member of the Union.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			I've been reading a lot of the discussion on here and elsewhere about the firing of more than 34 of my colleagues last week (31 in the UK + 3 in Canada) and have seen a lot of disinformation and lies that are really concerning. Particularly concerning how so many folk are willing to believe the Company's excuses.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Last week, my colleagues who were in the studio were each individually messaged by HR for a short friendly meeting, under the friendly guise of "Hey, are you free for a quick chat?"
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Upon attending this meeting they were handed an envelope with a short letter stating that their employment had been terminated for "gross misconduct" regarding posts made in Discord.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			They failed to provide any evidence when asked, nor was any stated in the letter. And did not divulge any other information or reasoning - "and no other reason"
		</p>

		

		<p>
			They refused their right to Union representation in the disciplinary meeting (which is against UK employment law) and were frogmarched out of the studio with the meeting lasting less than 5 minutes.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			For colleagues who were not in the Studio that day, they received a phone call from HR that lasted less than 2 minutes telling them they were fired and that they'd receive the same letter as above. I am aware of one employee who had a panic attack at this moment, and HR hung up on them during this panic attack not caring at all about their wellbeing.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			These colleagues of mine were hard workers who have spent many many years at R* in critical roles. With colleagues who have been at R* for more that 18 years and none of them have ever had a disciplinary in that time. They are not easily replaced and will certainly affect us in making our project deadlines.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			These are very senior artists, animators, QA testers, designers, programmers and producers. Including Leads. All super talented people who were proud of their work over multiple R* titles, and all they wanted was the best for R* and their fellow colleagues.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Some of these members were off sick, recovering from surgery or on paternity leave. Fired without pay, losing their careers and putting them into hardship in the lead up to Christmas, and even potentially losing their VISAs to work in the UK.&nbsp;
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Let me make this clear! I never saw any discussion/leaking of Rockstar projects in the Union Discord. The only ever discussion was around unionisation efforts and the working conditions at R*. The Discord wasn't public. It was a private Discord group that only contained R* employees and the IWGB Union officials.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			This was Union Busting and nothing else! Everyone fired was a Union Member, they were also predominantly from those who were on the Union Organising Committees of each UK studio.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Just one week before, the Union had reached ~200 members taking us over the 10% threshold required to seek recognition and begin engaging in collective bargaining. Allowing us to negotiate directly with management on the key issues that affect us: worsening crunch, inadequate pay and inflexible working arrangements.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			They have fired over 34 of us now. There were over 250 of us in that Union/Employee Discord group. There is the fear that if they get away with this, they'll have nothing stopping them from doing this again and again.
		</p>

		<p>
			Those of us who are lucky and remain for now work in fear! Fearful when talking to each other at the tea prep, fearful that we're next in line and are easily got rid of, too scared to go outside the studio and talk to (or even acknowledge) our colleagues outside protesting in fear of reprisals. Morale in the studio is at rock bottom. When we should be excited about what's to come over the next year we are now totally deflated and our trust and confidence in others is totally shot.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Which is the truly heartbreaking part, as for us in the Union, all of our ambition was to make R* a happier, fairer, safer and more equitable place. That's all. What has happened clearly shows that we care more about the wellbeing of our colleagues at Rockstar than the Company does.

			The union remains unbowed and is fighting to win the reinstatement of every dismissed member of staff at Rockstar through legal means and campaigning.&nbsp;
		</p>

		

		<p>
			This fight is critical, if Rockstar can get away with this, they will keep treating their workers with disdain, disrespect, and subjecting them to continued illegal treatment.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			Thanks for your time, and I hope this is some truth that helps you all understand what's going on here at the moment.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			I you would be so kind, you can contribute to the fundraiser to support those fighting their dismissal here: <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-rockstar-workers-fighting-unfair-dismissals/" rel="external nofollow">https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-rockstar-workers-fighting-unfair-dismissals/ </a>
		</p>

		

		<p>
			It would be really appreciated if you could also share the above link. I won’t be cross posting this to other forums, but please feel free to share.
		</p>

	You are seen, you are heard. It's a very sad to see them treat you as if you were disposable. Everyone loses in this process, and I really hope Rockstar backtracks on this decision and reinstate everyone affected.
</p>



<p>
	It's also eye opening to know crunch is back. It's clear that GTA VI is destroying the company, with its immense scope. However, that gives management no reason to treat you unfairly, especially when your demands are more than fair. I hope things turn out well for you and everyone!
</p>



<p>
	Also, thanks for all the work y'all done over the years! You are the best talent in the industry and deserve the best.

	<div>
		<p>
			Upon attending this meeting they were handed an envelope with a short letter stating that their employment had been terminated for "gross misconduct" regarding posts made in Discord.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			They failed to provide any evidence when asked, nor was any stated in the letter. And did not divulge any other information or reasoning - "and no other reason"
		</p>

		

		<p>
			They refused their right to Union representation in the disciplinary meeting (which is against UK employment law) and were frogmarched out of the studio with the meeting lasting less than 5 minutes.
		</p>

		

		<p>
			For colleagues who were not in the Studio that day, they received a phone call from HR that lasted less than 2 minutes telling them they were fired and that they'd receive the same letter as above. I am aware of one employee who had a panic attack at this moment, and HR hung up on them during this panic attack not caring at all about their wellbeing.
		</p>

<p>
	Sorry for what you guys have experienced. This kind of treatment from their HRs seems to be a pattern now. Some of our former FiveM team members were treated the same way.
</p>

<p>
	One of our team members was silently fired without any message or warning. They found out their contract had been terminated when they tried to boot up their work laptop and discovered it was locked... Had to email HRs themselves to hear that their contract is terminated.

	I was very upset and angry for the delay, but upon reading this incident i lost my faith and joy to GTA VI and Rockstar Games. For me Rockstar Games was an example of a studio which only delivered quality to us. But firing workers who dedicated for 18 years without proper investigation or clearance for in case of a misinformation/understanding is immature. What if this was an attack to Rockstar? Why would they not investigate it thoroughly instead of firing 18 years old experienced worker. This is shameful! I am NO LONGER INTERRESTED IN GTA VI. Not sorry. If Big guys at Rockstar are not loyal to their workers then i don't believe they will ever be loyal to us. This is disgusting.

                    The telecom giant claims its exit from public internet exchanges will give customers "lower latencies." The evidence suggests they're in for a nightmare.

When you click a YouTube video in Berlin, that data doesn't travel some convoluted path through half of Europe to reach you. It flows through something called an "internet exchange point"—a giant room full of routers where hundreds of networks connect directly, swapping traffic efficiently and, crucially, for free.</p><p><strong>Vodafone Germany is about to blow that system up.</strong></p><p>By the end of 2025, <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/Vodafone-leaves-public-internet-exchange-points-11068836.html?ref=coffee.link">Vodafone will have completely withdrawn</a> from every public internet exchange in Germany, including <a href="https://www.de-cix.net/en/locations?ref=coffee.link">DE-CIX Frankfurt, the largest internet exchange</a> on the planet. Instead, all traffic will flow through a single company called <a href="https://www.vodafone.com/news/technology/vodafone-selects-inter-link-to-enhance-interconnection-with-other-internet-service-providers?ref=coffee.link">Inter.link</a>, which charges content providers based on how much data they send to Vodafone customers. It's the telecom equivalent of a landlord announcing they're demolishing all the sidewalks in town and replacing them with a private toll road.</p><p>Vodafone <a href="https://www.vodafone.com/news/technology/vodafone-selects-inter-link-to-enhance-interconnection-with-other-internet-service-providers?ref=coffee.link">insists this will deliver</a> "lower latencies, more resilience, and cost savings." But if you're a Vodafone customer, you might want to brace yourself. Because there's a decade of evidence from Deutsche Telekom—Germany's other telecom giant, which did almost exactly the same thing—suggesting you're about to experience internet hell.</p><h2 id="the-open-internet-was-supposed-to-work-differently">The open internet was supposed to work differently</h2><p>To understand why this matters, you need to understand how the internet actually works. And it's not how most people think.</p><p>When you pay for internet service, you're not buying access to some centralized "internet"—you're buying access to your ISP's network. That network then connects to thousands of other networks through a patchwork of agreements and connections. The magic happens at places like <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/Anniversary-of-the-world-s-largest-Internet-exchange-DE-CIX-turns-30-10459960.html?ref=coffee.link">DE-CIX Frankfurt, where over 1,000 networks</a> plug into the same switching fabric and exchange traffic directly.</p><p>This system is called "settlement-free peering," and it's one of the internet's foundational principles. No money changes hands. Networks exchange traffic roughly equally, everyone saves money on long-haul transit costs, and users get faster connections because data takes the shortest possible path.</p><p>When Deutsche Telekom customers want to watch YouTube, that traffic flows directly from Google's network to Deutsche Telekom's network at a Frankfurt exchange point—maybe four or five router hops, minimal latency, no intermediaries. It's elegant. It's efficient. And it's exactly what Vodafone is abandoning.</p><h2 id="enter-the-middleman">Enter the middleman</h2><p>Instead of connecting directly to content providers at neutral exchange points, Vodafone is outsourcing all its peering to Inter.link, a Berlin-based company that operates what it calls a "peering-as-a-service" platform. <a href="https://inter.link/knowledgebase/peering-policy/?ref=coffee.link">Inter.link operates</a> more than 40 points of presence across 15 countries and claims connectivity to <a href="https://inter.link/news/inter.link-launches-major-network-extension-reaching-300-new-data-centers/?ref=coffee.link">300+ data centers in Europe</a>.</p><p>The pitch is automation. Instead of managing thousands of individual peering relationships, Vodafone gets "one-click provisioning" and "single sign-on access." For Vodafone's network operations team, this is genuinely simpler. But here's the thing: <em>operational efficiency for a telecom company and good service for customers are not the same thing.</em></p><p>Vodafone's official press release from November 2024 emphasized that the partnership with Inter.link would "reduce time, resources, and peering costs" while delivering "lower latencies" and "more resilience." What the company didn't mention is that "peering costs" in this context doesn't mean Vodafone's costs—it means the costs have shifted to content providers, who now have to pay Inter.link if they want decent connectivity to Vodafone's customers.</p><p>And if a content provider decides <em>not</em> to pay? That's when things get ugly.</p><h2 id="deutsche-telekoms-decade-of-documented-disaster">Deutsche Telekom's decade of documented disaster</h2><p>Deutsche Telekom pioneered this model in Germany, and the results have been catastrophic for customers. Not "slightly annoying" or "a bit slower"—genuinely, documentably terrible.</p><p>Consumer protection organizations have <a href="https://www.netzbremse.de/en/?ref=coffee.link">collected hundreds of complaints</a> describing systematic degradation. The pattern is consistent and damning:</p><p><strong>Software and downloads:</strong> Windows 11 updates taking five to six hours instead of minutes. GitHub downloads at 680 KB/s on 100 Mbps connections—a 94.6% reduction from expected speeds. Websites protected by Cloudflare loading in 15 seconds to 2.5 minutes instead of under one second.</p><p><strong>Gaming:</strong> Latency spiking from 20-30 milliseconds to 200-3,300 milliseconds during peak hours. Packet loss reaching 17-70% on some connections, making competitive gaming literally unplayable. When customers use VPNs to bypass Deutsche Telekom's routing, speeds instantly recover 100-fold—proving the problem isn't content provider infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Time-based patterns:</strong> Services work fine in the morning when traffic is low, degrade catastrophically during 7-11 PM peak hours, then recover late at night. Network experts have identified the root cause: Deutsche Telekom deliberately refuses to upgrade interconnection capacity when links reach congestion, creating artificial bottlenecks to pressure content providers into paid agreements.</p><p>The evidence is so overwhelming that <a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2025/05/no-two-tier-internet-coalition-files-complaint-against-deutsche-telekom?ref=coffee.link">in April 2025, a coalition</a> including Germany's federal consumer organization, digital rights groups, and Stanford Law School professor Barbara van Schewick filed formal complaints with the Federal Network Agency alleging net neutrality violations. The investigation is ongoing. Deutsche Telekom, for its part, denies everything while customers continue suffering through abysmal performance.</p><p>Now Vodafone is implementing the same model. That should terrify you if you're a Vodafone customer.</p><h2 id="the-warning-signs-are-already-appearing">The warning signs are already appearing</h2><p>The migration started in December 2024, and Vodafone customers are already reporting problems. A pattern emerges in <a href="https://forum.vodafone.de/t5/St%C3%B6rungen-im-Kabel-Netz/Massive-Probleme-mit-meinem-Kabelanschluss-seit-Februar-2024/td-p/3243668?ref=coffee.link">forum posts</a> and support tickets: complaints about service degradation beginning specifically in November-December 2024, escalating during evening hours, affecting streaming and gaming disproportionately.</p><p>One user on Vodafone's German forum documented "extreme ping issues" that "particularly escalated in recent weeks" in November 2024, with latency jumping from normal levels to 1,000-2,000 milliseconds. Another described complete connection breakdown during 6-10 PM evening hours, making working from home and gaming "essentially impossible."</p><p>YouTube appears prominently in complaints. <a href="https://forum.vodafone.de/t5/Archiv-St%C3%B6rungsmeldungen/Verbindung-Peering-zu-Google-Youtube-sehr-langsam/td-p/1797722?ref=coffee.link">Forum posts describe</a> "seit heute Abend ist Google / Youtube quasi nicht mehr zu erreichen" (since this evening Google/YouTube essentially unreachable), with traceroutes showing 1,000ms latency and 21 hops to reach Google instead of direct connections. That's not random—<a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/Vodafone-leaves-public-internet-exchange-points-11068836.html?ref=coffee.link">Heise.de, Germany's most authoritative tech publication</a>, specifically reported that Vodafone is "discontinuing existing direct interconnections with large data sources such as YouTube."</p><p>The affected services align perfectly with those that would need to establish new paid relationships with Inter.link: YouTube, Netflix, Twitch, gaming platforms. Netflix streams at 0.93 Mbps during peak hours on some Vodafone connections—enough for low-quality SD but nowhere near the 5+ Mbps users get on competing ISPs. Gaming servers show 100-350 millisecond latency when they should be 20-30 milliseconds.</p><p>Berlin residents experienced particular degradation when Vodafone withdrew from BCIX (Berlin Internet Exchange), with <a href="https://www.vodafonekabelforum.de/viewtopic.php?t=42638&amp;ref=coffee.link">forum posts noting</a> that BCIX peering "was eliminated months ago and notably worsened network quality for Berlin residents." Major content providers including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, and Twitch all peered at BCIX for low-latency Berlin connectivity. Those direct connections are gone, replaced by longer routes through Inter.link's more distant points of presence.</p><h2 id="the-physics-dont-support-vodafones-claims">The physics don't support Vodafone's claims</h2><p>Let's talk about that "lower latencies" promise, because it defies basic networking principles.</p><p><a href="https://labs.ripe.net/author/roberto_di_lallo/is-it-really-worth-peering-at-ixps-a-comparative-study/?ref=coffee.link">Academic research measuring performance</a> across 900+ networks found that 91% experience at least 5% latency improvement via direct peering versus transit, with median improvements of 12-15 milliseconds. The reason is simple physics: shorter paths are faster than longer paths.</p><p>Vodafone's migration does the opposite. Previously, a customer accessing YouTube might traverse three hops through direct peering at DE-CIX Frankfurt: from the customer's router to Vodafone's router to Google's router. Now that traffic must route through Inter.link as a mandatory intermediary, adding at least one additional hop and extending the physical path.</p><p>This is fundamental networking: every additional network you traverse adds latency from routing decisions, queuing delays, and physical transmission time. Direct peering at an exchange point minimizes this. Routing through an intermediary by definition increases it.</p><p>Unless Inter.link has discovered physics-defying routing magic—and they haven't published any evidence suggesting they have—adding mandatory intermediary hops cannot produce lower latency than direct connections. The architecture change moves in precisely the wrong direction.</p><p>Vodafone has published exactly zero supporting measurements. No traceroute comparisons. No latency benchmarks. No throughput tests. No independent technical validation. For a major telecommunications company claiming performance improvements while undertaking a massive infrastructure change, the absence of any quantitative evidence is deafening.</p><h2 id="the-satellite-escape-hatch">The satellite escape hatch</h2><p>While Vodafone dismantles its open peering infrastructure, an alternative has emerged that sidesteps these politics entirely: satellite internet.</p><p>Starlink operates its own global backbone network with direct agreements with major content providers. When you access YouTube via Starlink, traffic flows through SpaceX's network to satellites and down to your dish—a fundamentally different architecture from terrestrial ISP peering arrangements.</p><p>The €65/month residential service won't match premium fiber speeds, but <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/germany?ref=coffee.link">Ookla reports</a> consistent 161 Mbps median downloads in Germany with 40-50ms latency. More importantly: no selective throttling. Netflix and GitHub load at the same speeds because Starlink doesn't play favorites.</p><p>For customers experiencing Deutsche Telekom or Vodafone degradation, that consistency matters more than peak speed. The €299 hardware cost hurts, but you're paying for infrastructure that can't be weaponized for rent-seeking. And when Starlink has capacity issues, SpaceX launches more satellites—they solve congestion with infrastructure investment rather than weaponizing it for revenue extraction.</p><p>That competitive pressure matters. Every customer who switches from Vodafone to satellite because YouTube won't load is revenue walking out the door. Terrestrial ISPs aren't quite the monopolies they used to be.</p><p>Here's what Vodafone isn't saying in its press releases: this migration is fundamentally about changing the internet's economic model.</p><p>Traditional settlement-free peering operates on reciprocity. Networks exchange traffic because both sides benefit—Vodafone's customers want to access YouTube, and YouTube wants to reach Vodafone's customers. No money changes hands because the value exchange is mutual. It's one of the last genuinely cooperative aspects of internet infrastructure.</p><p>Vodafone's new model charges content providers based on traffic volume, creating what academic experts call a "termination monopoly." If you're a content provider and you want Vodafone's customers to have decent access to your service, you now have to pay Inter.link. <a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2025/05/no-two-tier-internet-coalition-files-complaint-against-deutsche-telekom?ref=coffee.link">Professor Barbara van Schewick of Stanford Law School</a>, whose work informed FCC net neutrality orders and EU guidelines, characterized similar practices by Deutsche Telekom as "a frontal attack on the open internet."</p><p>In <a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/content/files/2024/08/vanSchewick-2024-Comments-BEREC-Interconnection-Report-20240801-1.pdf?ref=coffee.link">August 2024 comments to European regulators</a>, van Schewick explained that ISPs exploit their "termination monopoly" by charging "monopoly termination fees" to reach subscribers, and concluded that "paid interconnection fees violate the Open Internet Regulation's ban on discrimination and paid fast lanes."</p><p>In December 2024, <a href="https://www.computerworld.ch/business/telekommunikation/swisscom-zero-settlement-peering-init7-betreiben-2945209.html?ref=coffee.link">Switzerland's telecommunications regulator delivered an 11-year ruling</a> against Swisscom for similar practices. The Swiss ComCom decision found that ISPs have a "technical monopoly of access to their end customers" and that charging content providers for traffic delivery is "not permissible" because costs are already covered by customer subscriptions. The ruling explicitly rejected the "double-dipping" model where both customers and content providers pay for internet access—precisely what Vodafone implements through Inter.link.</p><p>Think about that: you pay Vodafone for internet access. YouTube pays Inter.link for the privilege of serving you. Both ends pay, but the service you receive gets worse because the architecture degrades and bottlenecks concentrate through fewer connection points. Vodafone saves money on operational overhead while extracting new revenue from content providers. You, the customer, subsidize this twice and get a degraded product.</p><h2 id="regulators-are-paying-attention-finally">Regulators are paying attention (finally)</h2><p>The April 2025 complaint against Deutsche Telekom came from a coalition including <a href="https://epicenter.works/en/content/no-two-tier-internet-complaint-against-deutsche-telekom?ref=coffee.link">Germany's federal consumer organization</a> (Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband), Epicenter.works, Gesellschaft für Freiheitsrechte, and Stanford professor Barbara van Schewick. The complaint documents technical evidence of artificial bottlenecks and charges that Deutsche Telekom creates "paid fast lanes" prohibited under EU law.</p><p>BEREC (Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications) <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/Net-neutrality-alliance-files-complaint-against-Telekom-10365039.html?ref=coffee.link">released a report in December 2024</a> after a two-year investigation, identifying practices where ISPs "exploit bottlenecks at the entrance to its network to demand payments from online services" and classifying such practices as "potential violations of Europe's net neutrality law." The report listed "several examples, most of which involved Deutsche Telekom."</p><p>If the investigation finds Deutsche Telekom's model violates EU net neutrality regulations, Vodafone's identical approach faces the same legal jeopardy. Germany's Federal Network Agency has already shown willingness to act—<a href="https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/EN/2022/20220228_streaming.html?ref=coffee.link">in February 2022, it prohibited Vodafone's "Vodafone Pass"</a> zero-rating service following European Court of Justice rulings. The same authority could order Vodafone to abandon paid peering and return to settlement-free public peering.</p><p>But regulatory remedies take years. In the meantime, customers suffer.</p><h2 id="what-this-means-for-you">What this means for you</h2><p>If you're a Vodafone Germany customer, here's what you can probably expect based on Deutsche Telekom's decade of evidence and early Vodafone complaints:</p><p><strong>YouTube, Netflix, and streaming services</strong> will buffer more during evening hours. Quality will automatically downgrade. 4K streaming will become unreliable. These companies may eventually pay Inter.link's fees, but the degradation provides leverage for those negotiations.</p><p><strong>Gaming will become frustrating or unplayable</strong> during peak hours. Latency will spike. Packet loss will make competitive games impossible. You'll blame the game servers, but the problem is your ISP's routing.</p><p><strong>Video calls, remote work, cloud applications</strong>—anything latency-sensitive—will degrade during 7-11 PM peak hours when traffic concentrates through Inter.link's connection points. Your Zoom calls will pixelate. Your remote desktop sessions will lag. Your cloud backups will throttle.</p><p><strong>Smaller content providers, startups, regional services</strong>—anyone who can't or won't pay Inter.link's fees—will work noticeably worse on your Vodafone connection than on competing ISPs. You'll have a two-tiered internet: fast lanes for services that pay, slow lanes for everything else.</p><p>And when you call Vodafone support, they'll run speed tests that show your connection hitting advertised speeds to Vodafone's own servers, and they'll tell you everything looks fine from their end. Because technically, it does. The problem isn't your connection to Vodafone—it's Vodafone's restrictive connections to the rest of the internet.</p><h2 id="the-bigger-picture">The bigger picture</h2><p>Vodafone's exit from public peering isn't an isolated technical decision—it's part of a broader pattern of large telecoms trying to reshape internet economics in their favor. <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/Peering-Consumer-advocates-mobilize-against-Telekom-s-network-brake-10245513.html?ref=coffee.link">Thomas King, CTO of DE-CIX Frankfurt</a>, warned without naming companies directly: "We are currently observing a trend in which large market players are increasingly using their dominant position to monetize not only their Internet access business but also network interconnection."</p><p>The trend is particularly concentrated in Germany, where both major incumbent ISPs now operate restrictive paid peering models while competitors maintain open policies. <a href="https://www.it-administrator.de/vodafone-peering-interlink?ref=coffee.link">IT-Administrator, a leading German IT publication</a>, warned that Vodafone's shift "could reduce transparency, while smaller providers and content providers may face higher entry barriers" and "could impair the diversity and openness of European Internet infrastructure."</p><p>If this model proves profitable for Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom without regulatory consequences, expect other European telecoms to follow. The open internet—where networks cooperate through settlement-free peering to deliver the best possible service—gets replaced by a gatekeeper model where ISPs extract fees from both customers and content providers while delivering worse performance.</p><h2 id="the-internet-you-pay-for-isnt-the-internet-youre-getting">The internet you pay for isn't the internet you're getting</h2><p>Here's the fundamental thing to understand: when you pay Vodafone for internet service, you think you're buying neutral access to the global internet. You're not. You're buying access to Vodafone's network, and <em>Vodafone controls how well that network connects to everything else.</em></p><p>For decades, ISPs and content networks cooperated through settlement-free peering at neutral exchange points, creating the fast, reliable internet we take for granted. That cooperative model is breaking down, replaced by gatekeepers who charge both ends while delivering worse service.</p><p>Vodafone's marketing says the Inter.link migration will give you "lower latencies." The architecture says you're getting longer paths, more hops, and concentration through fewer connection points. Deutsche Telekom's decade of customer misery says you're about to experience systematic service degradation. Early Vodafone complaints say it's already starting.</p><p>The evidence is overwhelming. Vodafone customers should brace for impact. And everyone else should pay attention—because if this model succeeds in Germany, it's coming to your country next.</p><hr><h2 id="sources">Sources</h2><p><strong>Primary Sources:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.vodafone.com/news/technology/vodafone-selects-inter-link-to-enhance-interconnection-with-other-internet-service-providers?ref=coffee.link">Vodafone Press Release: Inter.link Partnership</a> (November 2024)</li><li><a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/Vodafone-leaves-public-internet-exchange-points-11068836.html?ref=coffee.link">Heise Online: Vodafone Leaves Public Internet Exchange Points</a></li><li><a href="https://www.de-cix.net/en/locations?ref=coffee.link">DE-CIX: Global Interconnection Ecosystem</a></li><li><a href="https://inter.link/news/inter.link-launches-major-network-extension-reaching-300-new-data-centers/?ref=coffee.link">Inter.link: Network Infrastructure and Locations</a></li><li><a href="https://inter.link/knowledgebase/peering-policy/?ref=coffee.link">Inter.link: Peering Policy and Network Information</a></li></ul><p><strong>Deutsche Telekom Complaints &amp; Evidence:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.netzbremse.de/en/?ref=coffee.link">Netzbremse: Deutsche Telekom Throttling Documentation</a></li><li><a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2025/05/no-two-tier-internet-coalition-files-complaint-against-deutsche-telekom?ref=coffee.link">Stanford CIS: Coalition Files Complaint Against Deutsche Telekom</a> (April 2025)</li><li><a href="https://epicenter.works/en/content/no-two-tier-internet-complaint-against-deutsche-telekom?ref=coffee.link">Epicenter.works: No Two-Tier Internet Complaint</a></li><li><a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/Peering-Consumer-advocates-mobilize-against-Telekom-s-network-brake-10245513.html?ref=coffee.link">Heise: Consumer Advocates Mobilize Against Telekom's "Network Brake"</a></li><li><a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/Net-neutrality-alliance-files-complaint-against-Telekom-10365039.html?ref=coffee.link">Heise: Net Neutrality Alliance Files Complaint</a></li></ul><p><strong>Customer Complaints:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://forum.vodafone.de/t5/St%C3%B6rungen-im-Kabel-Netz/Massive-Probleme-mit-meinem-Kabelanschluss-seit-Februar-2024/td-p/3243668?ref=coffee.link">Vodafone Community Forum: Massive Problems Since February 2024</a></li><li><a href="https://forum.vodafone.de/t5/Archiv-St%C3%B6rungsmeldungen/Verbindung-Peering-zu-Google-Youtube-sehr-langsam/td-p/1797722?ref=coffee.link">Vodafone Community Forum: YouTube/Google Connection Issues</a></li><li><a href="https://www.vodafonekabelforum.de/viewtopic.php?t=42638&amp;ref=coffee.link">Vodafone Kabel Forum: Regional Peerings Eliminated</a></li></ul><p><strong>Academic &amp; Technical Research:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://labs.ripe.net/author/roberto_di_lallo/is-it-really-worth-peering-at-ixps-a-comparative-study/?ref=coffee.link">RIPE Labs: Is It Really Worth Peering at IXPs?</a></li><li><a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/content/files/2024/08/vanSchewick-2024-Comments-BEREC-Interconnection-Report-20240801-1.pdf?ref=coffee.link">Barbara van Schewick: Comments on BEREC Interconnection Report</a> (August 2024)</li><li><a href="https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/germany?ref=coffee.link">Ookla Speedtest: Germany Performance Data</a></li></ul><p><strong>Regulatory &amp; Legal:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.computerworld.ch/business/telekommunikation/swisscom-zero-settlement-peering-init7-betreiben-2945209.html?ref=coffee.link">Swiss ComCom: Swisscom Zero-Settlement Peering Ruling</a> (December 2024)</li><li><a href="https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/EN/2022/20220228_streaming.html?ref=coffee.link">Bundesnetzagentur: Zero-Rating Prohibition</a> (February 2022)</li></ul><p><strong>Industry Analysis:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.it-administrator.de/vodafone-peering-interlink?ref=coffee.link">IT-Administrator: Vodafone Peering Only via Inter.link</a></li><li><a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/Anniversary-of-the-world-s-largest-Internet-exchange-DE-CIX-turns-30-10459960.html?ref=coffee.link">Heise: DE-CIX Turns 30</a></li></ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                        <p>Denmark’s government on Friday announced an agreement to ban access to social media for anyone under 15, ratcheting up pressure on Big Tech platforms as concerns grow that kids are getting too swept up in a digitized world of harmful content and commercial interests.</p><p>The move would give some parents — after a specific assessment — the right to let their children access social media from age 13. It wasn’t immediately clear how such a ban would be enforced: Many tech platforms already restrict pre-teens from signing up. Officials and experts say such restrictions don’t always work.</p><p>Such a measure would be among the most sweeping steps yet by a European Union government to limit use of social media among teens and younger children, which has drawn concerns in many parts of an increasingly online world.</p><p>Speaking to The Associated Press, Caroline Stage, Denmark’s minister for digital affairs, said 94% of Danish children under age 13 have profiles on at least one social media platform, and more than half of those under 10 do. </p>
    
<p>“The amount of time they spend online — the amount of violence, self-harm that they are exposed to online — is simply too great a risk for our children,” she said, while praising tech giants as “the greatest companies that we have. They have an absurd amount of money available, but they’re simply not willing to invest in the safety of our children, invest in the safety of all of us.”</p>
    
<h2>No rush to legislation, no loopholes for tech giants</h2><p>Stage said a ban won’t take effect immediately. Allied lawmakers on the issue from across the political spectrum who make up a majority in parliament will likely take months to pass relevant legislation. </p><p>“I can assure you that Denmark will hurry, but we won’t do it too quickly because we need to make sure that the regulation is right and that there is no loopholes for the tech giants to go through,” Stage said. Her ministry said pressure from tech giants’ business models was “too massive.” </p><p>It follows a move in December in Australia, where parliament enacted the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/australia-social-media-children-ban-safeguarding-harm-accounts-d0cde2603bdbc7167801da1d00ecd056">world’s first ban on social media for children</a></span> — setting the minimum age at 16.</p><p>That made platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram subject to fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts.</p><p>Officials in Denmark didn’t say how such a ban would be enforced in a world where millions of children have easy access to screens. But Stage noted that Denmark has a national electronic ID system — nearly all Danish citizens over age 13 have such an ID — and plans to set up an age-verification app. Several other EU countries are testing such apps. </p><p>“We cannot force the tech giants to use our app, but what we can do is force the tech giants to make proper age verification, and if they don’t, we will be able to enforce through the EU commission and make sure that they will be fined up to 6% of their global income.”</p>
    
<h2>Aiming to shield kids from harmful content online</h2><p>Many governments have been grappling with ways of limiting harmful fallout from online technologies, without overly squelching their promise. Stage said Denmark’s legislative push was “not about excluding children from everything digital” — but keeping them away from harmful content.</p><p>China — which manufacturers many of the world’s digital devices — has set limits on <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gaming-business-children-00db669defcc8e0ca1fc2dc54120a0b8">online game time</a></span> and <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-internet-restrictions-children-smartphone-limits-8435b530b117b70357856ddf6a5968d1">smart-phone time</a></span> for kids. </p><p>Prosecutors in Paris this week announced an investigation into <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/france-tiktok-suicide-children-investigation-3d8691d1cbc04d13b9d6b97af5e08699">allegations that TikTok allows content promoting suicide</a></span> and that its algorithms may encourage vulnerable young people to take their own lives.</p><p>“Children and young people have their sleep disrupted, lose their peace and concentration, and experience increasing pressure from digital relationships where adults are not always present,” the Danish ministry said. “This is a development that no parent, teacher or educator can stop alone.”</p><p>The EU’s Digital Services Act, which took effect two years ago, forbids children younger than 13 to hold accounts on social media like TikTok and Instagram, video sharing platforms like YouTube and Twitch, and sites like Reddit and Discord, as well as AI companions. </p>
    
<p>Many social media platforms have for years banned anyone 13 or under from signing up for their services. TikTok users can verify their ages by submitting a selfie that will be analyzed to estimate their age. Meta Platforms, parent of Instagram and Facebook, says it uses a similar system for video selfies and AI to help figure out a user’s age.</p><p>Meta and TikTok didn’t respond immediately to requests for comment from the AP.</p><p>“We’ve given the tech giants so many chances to stand up and to do something about what is happening on their platforms. They haven’t done it,” said Stage, the Danish minister. “So now we will take over the steering wheel and make sure that our children’s futures are safe.”</p><p>___</p><p>AP Business Writer Kelvin Chan contributed to this report. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p>Every morning, I wake up and ask myself: why isn’t OCaml more
popular? I mean, the language is not perfect, but the more I use it the
more I feel like this old language had it all figured out, somehow. I
mean, not in the literal sense: you write <code>String.of_X</code>
instead of <code>String.from_X</code> because the language has French
origins. But it is perfect in the sense that it has everything that is
important to me, except popular adoption. OCaml has its quirks, its old
age, but at the same time there is so much I appreciate about it.</p>
<p>I have some experience building amateur and professional software, in
many different languages, and as a result I have collected a list of
characteristics that I’ve come to appreciate over time. I think my
journey into programming is different from many. I learned and adored
functional programming before working in the industry, and while not my
very first language, Haskell was important to me early on. Functional
programming has allowed me to break big, complex problems down into
subproblems that I know how to solve. It has made me a better thinker.
Add to that the static guarantees of Haskell, which makes the mental
overhead much lower than for other languages, and I am also more
productive. Most importantly, with Haskell, I can focus more on the fun
parts of programming.</p>
<p>However, Haskell’s issues lie in its immense complexity and slow
compile times. I did say that Haskell lowers the mental overhead of
programming, but that’s only if you use a small subset of the language.
However because much of the community is very maximalist, introducing a
lot of complexity into the code becomes inevitable. Much of the code you
interact with is too “smart”, and becomes very hard to grok. Its runtime
is also very complex, and there’s always the chance of running into
notorious “space leaks”, that are extremely hard to debug.</p>
<p>At some point, I started exploring a language that is probably the
polar opposite to Haskell: Go. With Go, I learned to appreciate
simplicity and low-levels of abstractions, a good set of tooling, fast
performance and fast compilation speed. I also started to appreciate
good documentation that is easily available offline. The culture around
Go also places a lot of value on simple solutions, which made
interacting with the ecosystem easier. I can jump into any code base and
understand what is happening.</p>
<p>Over time, I also grew to hate the issues that come
with the language being so conservative: it is verbose in its error
handling yet manages to be fragile. At the same time, it doesn’t
have explicit null checks. These factors combined makes Go quite unpleasant and
easy to write buggy code in. I also found myself missing a REPL or fast
way of interacting with the program. The language is “predictably
disappointing”, which I guess is a good thing. However, the solutions to
those disappointments have been around before the language was even
created and I am just left feeling that these solutions could have been
implemented, and the compiler would not be much more complex as a
result. It just genuinely felt like the Go language designers didn’t
want to engage with any of the ideas coming from functional programming.
But I digress.</p>
<p>From these experiences, a list of features I consider to be “good”
features in a general programming language started to emerge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast compile times</li>
<li>Fewer abstractions, and an easy to understand runtime</li>
<li>Strong static guarantees</li>
<li>Functional programming constructs. Especially pattern matching and
sum types.</li>
<li>Good performance</li>
<li>Good documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>And then, enter OCaml. This language just checks so many boxes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong static guarantees. Sum types, polymorphic variants, pattern
matching.</li>
<li>Simpler runtime semantics. OCaml is weird in that it’s a garbage
collected language for systems, similar to Go. A seasoned OCaml
programmer is probably able to gauge what the compiled assembler looks
like just by looking at the code. That is a great quality.</li>
<li>Fast compile times. When using Haskell or Rust, the slow compile
times really kill your productivity. With Dune, OCaml compiles extremely
fast. Faster than Go I believe?</li>
<li>Similar to Go, OCaml can be compiled statically into a single
binary, making it easy to deploy.</li>
<li>Great documentation. OCaml has odig to browse documentation offline,
utop as a REPL to explore code, and also separates interface files from
implementation files. This makes it very pleasant to browse OCaml code.
The types help guide the user.</li>
<li>Automatically inferred types. I didn’t think this would matter, as
writing out the types used to help my thinking. But now that I am more
“fluent”, it is more typing and less code. In OCaml, modules
separate interface files from implementation, and these are a better
place to put types.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m left feeling that the authors of OCaml have good taste. It
is an old language, and there are a few features that could probably be left out
like the OOP-related features, and some libraries in the ecosystem over-complicate things
like in Haskell. But overall, it’s just damn good. There are a lot of
other features I appreciate about OCaml that I didn’t share. But to
summarize why I love it: the right balance between simple and
expressive, good documentation and good tooling.</p>

<h3><strong>AI and Pathfinding</strong></h3>



<p><em>Contributions from </em><strong><em>Aussiemon, Capo, elsid</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>Evil Eye</em></strong></p>



<p>OpenMW’s navmesh-based pathfinding is already more elaborate than Morrowind’s. Some even wish it were less so.</p>



<p>There was, however, a case where it failed. The original content-supplied path grid works as a hint on where roads and bridges are so that wandering characters aren’t ignorant of the infrastructure. This is all well and good until you realise the content might be wrong and put some points inside rocks. Miraculously, Morrowind avoided the problem, so we had to solve it: wandering NPCs will now ignore the points they cannot reach.</p>



<p>Another situation where OpenMW could fall behind Morrowind was sneaking. In out-of-combat situations, Morrowind updates awareness only every so often, and characters don’t have superhuman (or superelvish) reaction time while observing your… exploits. It doesn’t mean the reaction time would reflect that of a real person, but it does the job. Sort of.</p>



<p>OpenMW, meanwhile, would update awareness every frame, which could mean the sneak indicator would be rather unreliable in figuring out whether you’re hidden. 0.50.0 still updates awareness every frame to react to sudden changes in how difficult it is to track the player, but it will cache the random dice roll result used for the relevant check for 5 seconds. This makes Sneak experience farming, err, that is, gaining less challenging.</p>

<h3><strong>Configuration and VFS</strong></h3>

<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8077">#8077</a>] Setting files are now saved when you exit the settings window, rather than only when you exit the game</li>

</ul>



<h3><strong>ESM Format and Saved Games</strong></h3>



<p><em>Contribution from </em><strong><em>S3ctor</em></strong></p>



<p>We took care not to change the saved game format. This means that you should be able to revert to 0.49.0 on your ongoing playthrough if you experience issues in the new release, although this is not really recommended.</p>



<p><strong>Fixes</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8333">#8333</a>] Reading quest status subrecords no longer causes the rest of the quest record data to be discarded</li>
</ul>



<h3><strong>Gameplay</strong></h3>



<p><em>Contributions from </em><strong><em>Aussiemon, Capo, Evil Eye, Foal</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>Kuyondo</em></strong></p>



<p>As usual, and as we’re striving for a reasonably faithful reimplementation of the original experience, we have to sort out minor game mechanics inconsistencies. Do you think this will end at some point? Me neither.</p>



<p>You might already know prison time can improve your Sneak and Security skills. One thing that wasn’t replicated is the improvement counting towards level progress if you’ve chosen one of them as a major or a minor skill. On its own, this may not sound notable, but it was actually implemented by dehardcoding jail skill progression (well, mostly regression). Like the rest of the level progression previously dehardcoded in 0.49.0, it was moved into the built-in scripting.</p>



<p>But there were also more obviously problematic differences solved in this release. For example, Next/Previous Spell key bindings are now able to cope with enchanted items that come in stacks, rather than get stuck equipping the items of this type. Another example is that pickpocketing is now slightly less obnoxiously unfair, as OpenMW’s judicial system will no longer try to indict you for the same crime twice due to a design flaw.</p>



<p><strong>Fixes</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/6039">#6039</a>] Next Spell now skips over items that belong to the same stack as the current item (it would previously get stuck if there were multiple copies)</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/7622">#7622</a>] Ranged attacks will now hit underwater if you’re up close to a target (this matches Morrowind)</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/7649">#7649</a>] Sounds and visual effects of resisted effects no longer play</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/7693">#7693</a>] Potions and ingredients no longer visually end up back in the inventory for a single frame before getting picked up again for convenient consumption (0.49.0 regression)</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/7996">#7996</a>] Instant (zero-duration) effects can now act immediately. For example, instant Cure Poison can immediately cure the instant Poison preceding it</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8303">#8303</a>] Underwater spell projectiles cast by objects will explode rather than immediately disappear (this matches Morrowind)</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8340">#8340</a>] Multi-effect enchantment service price is now noticeably lower and should match Morrowind; it’s now based on the accumulated strength of the final effect rather than the enchantment’s overall strength</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8371">#8371</a>] Silence no longer affects powers</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8383">#8383</a>] Bound helm and boot effects cast on beast race characters are now interrupted immediately</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8399">#8399</a>] Jail-induced major/minor skill increases count as level progress</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8404">#8404</a>] Actors will no longer equip items to all slots when they want to replace their equipped light with a more appropriate shield. This allows the prevent merchant equipping option to work more intuitively for exterior merchants</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8446">#8446</a>] Travel prices are calculated more accurately when the player has multiple followers: instead of calculating the offered price based on the base price for one character and multiplying it, the base price is multiplied first and then used for the offer</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8459">#8459</a>] Spell prices are autocalculated properly for autocalculated spells</li>

<h3><strong>Graphics</strong></h3>



<p><em>Contributions from </em><strong><em>akortunov, AnyOldName3, Aussiemon, Capo, Evil Eye, wareya</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>wazabear</em></strong></p>



<p>0.50.0 comes with improved compatibility with various modded assets, thanks to the skinned geometry implementation being reworked to account for the skinning origin.</p>



<p>Wait, you probably don’t know what any of this means…</p>



<p>We’re not going to give you a course on 3D animation here, but long story short, most animations are based on moving bones around in the object’s “skeleton” (not literal bones, more like points). The object’s geometry is oriented relative to the bones. Spooked yet? More importantly, though, the geometry may be set up by the model artist in a way that it will graciously react to their movement by moving its triangles closer or farther from some bones in a process called skinning. Actors’ bodies and equipment tend to do this. Aside from bone weights and orientations, Morrowind’s (or rather, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=NetImmerse">NetImmerse</a>‘s) skinning data format includes the “base” bone of the geometry and its adjusted orientation. Previous releases of OpenMW would try to get away with ignoring those, but it didn’t work out so well. For example, the sails of some ships in <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42270">abot’s Boats</a> would be shifted vertically. Well, not any more.</p>

<p><em>Wait, is that mod STILL not compatible?</em></p>



<p>0.50.0 also comes with fixes for OpenMW’s very own features: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mapping">normal mapping</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_mapping">parallax mapping</a>.</p>



<p>Terrain normal maps previously erroneously used the OpenGL vertical convention. Like objects, they were supposed to use the DirectX convention. Essentially, they were flipped vertically. No more headache for artists: the convention is now finally consistent between objects and terrain.</p>



<p>Parallax will also no longer be flipped inappropriately — more specifically, when it’s applied to “mirrored” geometry. It will also not abruptly disappear forever when the parallax-mapped object glows due to enchantments and triggered traps.</p>



<p>There aren’t any shiny <em>new</em> graphical features in 0.50.0, but we should have already surpassed Morrowind in various areas here, so it’s not an issue, right?</p>

<h3><strong>Scripting: OpenMW-Lua</strong></h3>



<p><em>Contributions from </em><strong><em>akortunov, Calandiel, DaisyHasaCat, Evil Eye, fallchildren, Foal, S3ctor, trav</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>wazabear</em></strong></p>



<p>So what is it about combat that is no longer locked up in the C++? That would be some of what happens when an attack connects: applying armour and difficulty to the damage, spawning blood, playing hit and miss sounds and damaging armour condition. What this means for modding is that scripts can now intercept attacks that land on a certain target, whether they succeed or fail, alter <em>some of</em> their outcome, and potentially override the mentioned mechanics entirely. Eventually, this functionality will be expanded to cover more of what happens before, upon and after impact.</p>



<p>0.50.0’s API also opens up more of the game world by means of its weather and terrain APIs and region record bindings. The early terrain API, for example, exposes the terrain textures, allowing for such incredible feats as letting the player <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/57130">touch grass</a>, while the weather API lets you manipulate various built-in weather settings.</p>



<p>Additionally, scripts can now access the player’s journal and create entirely custom NPCs. No plugins necessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Important: </strong>OnUpdate handler behaviour has changed for previously skipped paused frames! They are now handled with a simulation time of zero. This will affect scripts that assume simulation time is always positive, so they will need to be updated. It was necessary to allow scripts to react more fluidly to events happening during the pause, like combat music reacting to combat state changes during dialogue.</p>



<p>For a full overview of the current state of OpenMW-Lua, please consult <a href="https://openmw.readthedocs.io/en/openmw-0.50.0/reference/lua-scripting/api.html">the scripting API reference</a>.</p>

<p>Kudos to the international community of our Discord/IRC servers for helping us translate OpenMW!</p>



<p>As you may have heard, the headline feature of this release is, undeniably, the improved gamepad support introduced by our talented new contributor enoznal. By enabling the Controller Menus option in the launcher, you will be able to use the controller action buttons to navigate more conveniently through the slightly altered in-game UI. You are no longer limited to the combination of emulated mouse and A button use available previously. For example, you can brew potions and enchant items entirely without using the emulated mouse. While the alternative UI is not at all reminiscent of Morrowind’s famous official Xbox port, it should be intuitive enough for those familiar with it. The following screenshots use GUI scaling for better readability; the option does not scale UI on its own.</p>

<p><em>At least the Dwemer didn’t dabble in planned obsolescence.</em></p>



<p>This release also introduces Polish translations for user interface lines that are not translated by the game settings. Polish is one of the languages in which Morrowind was officially released, and we expect the sizeable Polish community to appreciate this addition.</p>

<p>Our content file editor’s selection markers got a design overhaul for better usability, while created/cloned instance numbering has been updated to be less eager to take over the numerical IDs used by other instances. This is particularly important when working on content that may override the instances from some other content. Which is actually a lot of content, come to think of it…</p>

<h3><strong>Beyond Morrowind</strong></h3>



<p><em>Major contributions from </em><strong><em>ptmikheev</em></strong><br><em>Contributions from </em><strong><em>Capo</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>cc9cii</em></strong></p>



<p>Didn’t get the memo? As the <a href="https://openmw.org/2025/openmw-0-49-0-released/">0.49.0 release announcement</a> boasted, running Oblivion and later Bethesda open-world engine games is in the engine’s eventual scope.</p>



<p>Petr Mikheev, the OpenMW-Lua pioneer, though mostly retired from his Lua maintenance role, keeps a special interest in advancing OpenMW’s relevant capabilities. During this release cycle, he thought to try his hand at finishing cc9cii’s work on a terrain texturing reimplementation, cleaning it up, fixing various issues and, importantly, implementing texture sampling for distant terrain— as well as implementing distant objects most straightforwardly: by plugging all cell references into OpenMW’s object paging functionality used for Morrowind’s LOD-free world.</p>



<p>That is, yes, any trees you see are full-detail trees. Any trees you <em>think</em> you should see but do not are probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpeedTree">SpeedTree</a> trees.</p>

        <p>We're building infrastructure that manages other people's infrastructure. State corruption can't be "rare." It has to be impossible. That's why we chose OCaml.</p>

        <p><img src="https://stategraph.dev/blog/why-we-chose-ocaml/ocaml-logo.svg" alt="OCaml logo">
            <img src="https://stategraph.dev/blog/why-we-chose-ocaml/ocaml-logo-dark.svg" alt="OCaml logo">
        </p>

        <p>Stategraph stores Terraform state as a dependency graph in PostgreSQL with resource-level locking. The challenge isn't building a database-backed state store. The challenge is ensuring that concurrent operations can never corrupt state, even with concurrent operations/users, that database schema changes break the build instead of production, and that JSON transformations are correct.</p>

        <p>We chose OCaml because its type system catches entire categories of bugs at compile time that would require extensive testing and still slip through in other languages.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Type-safe data structures</h2>

            <p>Here's a scenario every infrastructure engineer has seen. Two Terraform operations run concurrently and both read a resource in an <code>active</code> state. One updates it while the other destroys it. Without proper coordination, you risk marking the resource as <code>destroyed</code> in state while it's still being modified in the cloud.</p>

            <p>Most systems handle this defensively with locks and runtime validation, but race conditions are hard to test and the resulting state corruption usually appears in production, not CI.</p>

            <p>Stategraph tackles this in two ways. Immutability and database-level locking prevent concurrent writes from corrupting state, while OCaml's type system makes the underlying data structures themselves safer by construction. Resources, outputs, and instances are all defined as strongly-typed records, so you can't access a field that doesn't exist or mix up field types. The compiler enforces correctness before anything runs.</p>

            <div role="region" aria-label="Type-safe resource definitions">
                    <p>type t = {</p>
                    <p>  lineage : string;</p>
                    <p>  outputs : Outputs.t option;</p>
                    <p>  resources : Resources.t;</p>
                    <p>  serial : int;</p>
                    <p>  terraform_version : string;</p>
                    <p>  version : int;</p>
                    <p>}</p>
                </div>

            <p>If you try to access <code>state.versions</code> (typo) instead of <code>state.version</code>, you get a compiler error. If you try to assign a string to <code>serial</code>, you get a compiler error. If you forget to handle <code>None</code> in the outputs field, you get a compiler error with exhaustiveness checking.</p>

            <p>This extends throughout the codebase. Every Terraform resource type, every state transition, and every database record is strongly typed. The compiler catches entire categories of bugs at compile time, like accessing non-existent fields, missing null checks, or database schema mismatches.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>The database schema drift problem</h2>

            <p>You're iterating on your database schema by renaming a column, changing a type, or adding a constraint. In most languages, you update the schema, deploy the migration, and hope you caught all the queries that reference the old structure. You didn't because a query somewhere references the old column name. It works in dev with the old schema but crashes in staging with the new schema.</p>

            <p>Stategraph uses typed SQL where every query declares explicit types for its parameters and return values. When you change a query's type signature, every call site in the codebase must be updated to match, and the compiler enforces this.</p>

            <div role="region" aria-label="Type-checked database queries">
                    <p>let insert_resource_sql () =</p>
                    <p>  Pgsql_io.Typed_sql.(</p>
                    <p>    sql</p>
                    <p>    // Ret.bigint</p>
                    <p>    /^ "INSERT INTO resources (state_id, mode, type, name,</p>
                    <p>        provider_id, module_) VALUES ($state_id, $mode,</p>
                    <p>        $type, $name, $provider_id, $module_) RETURNING id"</p>
                    <p>    /% Var.uuid "state_id"</p>
                    <p>    /% Var.text "mode"</p>
                    <p>    /% Var.text "type"</p>
                    <p>    /% Var.text "name"</p>
                    <p>    /% Var.uuid "provider_id"</p>
                    <p>    /% (Var.option @@ Var.text "module_"))</p>
                </div>

            <p>This query expects specific types. The <code>state_id</code> must be a UUID, <code>mode</code> must be text, and <code>module_</code> is optional text. The return value is typed as <code>bigint</code>. If you try to pass a string where a UUID is expected, you get a compiler error. If you forget to handle the optional return value, you get a compiler error.</p>

            <p>When you update a query to match a new schema, the type system ensures every place that calls that query gets updated too. You can't deploy code where query definitions and their usage are out of sync.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>JSON transformations that can't lose data</h2>

            <p>Stategraph ingests Terraform state as JSON, normalizes it into a graph, stores it in PostgreSQL, and reconstructs it back to JSON when Terraform requests it. Every transformation is a place where data can get lost or corrupted, whether from a field you forgot to serialize, a nested structure you flattened incorrectly, or a type that doesn't round-trip.</p>

            <p>Testing can catch some of this, and round-trip tests help, but you're fundamentally relying on test coverage. Missed cases show up when someone's Terraform state comes back missing a field.</p>

            <p>OCaml has a feature called PPX (preprocessor extensions) that generates serialization code automatically. You define the type, and the serializer is generated from the type definition.</p>

            <div role="region" aria-label="Automatic JSON serialization">
                    <p>type aws_instance = {</p>
                    <p>  instance_id : string;</p>
                    <p>  instance_type : string;</p>
                    <p>  ami : string;</p>
                    <p>  availability_zone : string option;</p>
                    <p>  tags : (string * string) list;</p>
                    <p>} [@@deriving yojson]</p>
                    
                    
                    
                </div>

            <p>When you add a field, the serializer is regenerated. When you change a type, the serializer is regenerated. If you forget to handle a case, the exhaustiveness checker catches it at compile time. You don't write serialization tests because the type system guarantees serialization is correct.</p>

            <p>This is how Stategraph handles Terraform's resource types. Every AWS resource, every GCP resource, every Azure resource is an OCaml type with automatic JSON serialization. We don't write serialization code. We don't test round-trips manually. The type system handles it.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Race conditions prevented by default</h2>

            <p>Terraform operations are inherently concurrent. Multiple users apply changes, CI pipelines run in parallel, and drift detection scans resources continuously. Coordinating all of this without data races requires careful mutex management and defensive programming, and it's easy to get wrong.</p>

            <p>OCaml provides immutability by default, so you can't accidentally share mutable state between concurrent operations because there is no mutable state by default. When you want to modify something, you create a new version explicitly. This eliminates entire categories of race conditions.</p>

            <p>One operation can't corrupt another operation's view of state because state is immutable by default. When combined with PostgreSQL's row-level locking at the database layer, concurrent operations compose correctly without manual mutex management or defensive copying.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Error handling with discipline</h2>

            <p>Type safety is only half of what makes Stategraph robust. The other half is discipline in how we use those types.</p>

            <p>We encode errors as variants and exhaustively match every case. We never use a catch-all "else" clause that matches everything. When we add a new error to the system, the compiler tells us every place we aren't handling it. This is how robust systems are built. Systems can fail in far more ways than they succeed, and the compiler ensures we handle all of them.</p>

            <p>This discipline extends throughout the codebase. Every error case is explicit. Every state transition is enumerated. Every optional value is handled. The type system gives us the tools, but discipline is what turns those tools into reliability.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>The difference in practice</h2>

            <p><img src="https://stategraph.dev/blog/why-we-chose-ocaml/runtime-vs-compile-time-dark.svg" alt="Diagram comparing runtime validation where bugs are found in production versus compile-time safety where bugs are prevented by the compiler">
                
            </p>

            <p>The same categories of bugs. Different places to catch them.</p>
        </div>

        

        <div>
            <h2>Production systems that can't afford bugs</h2>

            <p>This isn't academic type theory. Production systems use OCaml for exactly this reason.</p>

            <p>At <a href="https://terrateam.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terrateam</a>, we process thousands of concurrent Terraform operations daily, managing infrastructure for hundreds of organizations where a state corruption bug would cascade across every customer. We're built on OCaml, and the type system catches bugs at compile time that would be production incidents in other languages.</p>

            <p>Jane Street trades billions daily on OCaml infrastructure. Their trading systems handle concurrent market data and execute trades with zero tolerance for race conditions or undefined behavior. They chose OCaml because correctness isn't optional.</p>

            <div>
                <h4>Pattern Recognition</h4>
                <p>Systems that absolutely cannot fail choose languages where certain failures are impossible, not just unlikely. Testing finds bugs, but types prevent entire categories of bugs from existing.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>But who knows OCaml?</h2>

            <p>This is the most common objection, and OCaml developers are rare. This is true.</p>

            <p>But here's what we've found. Engineers who understand distributed systems, type systems, and correctness learn OCaml quickly. The learning curve from Rust, Haskell, or even TypeScript with advanced types is gentler than you'd expect because the concepts transfer even if the syntax is unfamiliar.</p>

            <p>More importantly, OCaml codebases are stable. We're not debugging race conditions or chasing down production crashes from schema drift. We're not writing extensive test suites for serialization edge cases. We're building features while the type system handles the category of bugs that would otherwise consume engineering time.</p>

            <p>When you encode correctness in types, maintenance gets easier instead of harder. New engineers spend less time understanding implicit invariants and more time writing code the compiler verifies.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Correctness as a feature</h2>

            <p>We're building Stategraph to manage Terraform state for infrastructure that runs production applications. State corruption has to be impossible instead of unlikely. Invalid state transitions need to be prevented by the compiler instead of caught by tests. Schema drift needs to break the build instead of production.</p>

            <p>That's what OCaml gives us. It provides a type system that makes entire categories of bugs impossible instead of just unlikely. The compiler proves properties about our code that testing can only approximate.</p>

            <pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 07:09:30 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://prison.josh.mn/lessons">https://prison.josh.mn/lessons</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45844197">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>There are some contemporary piracy services that run ads—for marketing and, well, advertising purposes. This ranges
from PPC to social media campaigns. I opted not to, mostly because I didn't think I could do it tastefully,
and because I'd probably attract users who wouldn't be great customers.</p>

<p>Instead, my marketing relied entirely on word-of-mouth—which meant building tremendous trust with my users,
plus a single growth hack that I'll describe later on this page.</p>

<p>This is all fairly standard startup knowledge—I've worked with more than a handful of Y Combinator companies and I could apply this to all of them—but it's interesting to see how many parallels existed between what I built and what a "real" startup looks like.  </p>

<p>I learned a lot about running a business while operating HeheStreams: customer experience, retention, product design, and the weird parallels between illegal streaming and your typical B2C.  </p>

<p>Think of this as a founder postmortem with felony-level customer support.</p>

<h2>Lessons from Growing a B2C</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>noreply@</code> is absolutely stupid.</strong><br></li>
</ul>

<p>I did everything I could to be visible to customers and encouraged them to talk to me any time. That helped build trust in a product sitting in a sea of shady, fly-by-night operations. I ended every email with some variation of "If you need anything, just reply :)".</p>

<p><strong>Get customers started.</strong>  </p>

<p>After a user subscribed, I sent a sequence of onboarding emails to make sure they were actually using the site: After three days, I'd check whether they'd watched anything and ask if they needed help; after they watched <em>n</em> minutes, I'd send an NPS-style survey ("1–10, how likely are you to recommend...") and if they gave a 9 or 10, I'd invite them to leave a review; if they didn't watch anything within two weeks, I offered a refund and suggestions on where else to watch.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Send fun emails.</strong><br></li>
</ul>

<p>My copywriting was tongue-in-cheek and self-deprecating. It was all me, no bullshit. I treated <em>every</em> message—even transactional emails—as an opportunity to build trust. Users regularly told me they actually enjoyed reading my emails, which is not a thing that should happen.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Be honest about service availability.</strong><br></li>
</ul>

<p>If things went sideways, I owned it. No hiding behind "maintenance windows."</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A customer with a bad taste in their mouth is bad.</strong><br></li>
</ul>

<p>If someone used their entire subscription and then asked for a refund, I'd still honor it—no questions asked. My users were shockingly honest, and I rarely dealt with chargebacks. My abuse detector barely had to do anything over 66 months.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>It's okay to be direct about churn.</strong><br></li>
</ul>

<p>I'd send messages like, "Hey, I saw you didn't renew. Did you find a good place to watch? Anything I could've done better?" People usually responded—nicely, even.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Recommend your competitors if you have to.</strong><br></li>
</ul>

<p>If a user wasn't a good fit, I happily pointed them toward alternatives. It built credibility, even if it lost me a sale.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>You don't need to target everyone.</strong><br></li>
</ul>

<p>I intentionally priced higher than competitors. That filtered in customers who were more tech-savvy and saw HeheStreams as an "investment in their leisure time," not a "cost."</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Be great at one thing, and half-assed at nothing.</strong> </li>
</ul>

<p>I never added generic IPTV or random channels. I focused purely on sports. That probably left money on the table, but it kept quality high.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Say no.</strong><br></li>
</ul>

<p>Say no a lot. Customers can be stupid.</p>

<h2>The growth hack</h2>

<p>My proudest growth hack involved Reddit's API. I filtered posts mentioning phrases like "NBA League Pass," "blackouts," or "where to" on team-specific subreddits. Then I gave my users lists of those posts and encouraged them to comment—transparently—about why they liked HeheStreams, including their referral link.</p>

<p>Each referrer got a $10 credit per subscriber, and new subscribers got $10 off their next month. It worked well.</p>

<h2>Lessons still work</h2>

<p>I've applied these same principles to a Mexican ecotourism business with great success. Some of them will never scale to hundreds of thousands of customers (you can't automate personality or hire for charm), but they work beautifully for small, honest teams. That's enough for me.</p>

<h2>Why word-of-mouth beats ads (especially when you can't run ads)</h2>

<p>I believe that trust mechanics are reflections of self. If they're artificial, people will see right through them.</p>

<h2>The takeaway</h2>

<p>Wouldn't trade the lessons; would strongly advise against the exit strategy. "Acquired" by Alliance for Creativity/Motion Picture Association.</p>

It is, by the standards of such tools, highly compatible with existing code -- so much so that building a full linux distro userspace seems likely within reach with only modest patching effort. The stated performance overheads (<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251028-filcc-vs-clang.html">measured by Dan Bernstein at "about 1-4x cycles"</a>) are by modern standards "probably tolerable" for many workloads (EDIT: <a href="https://gist.github.com/graydon/c769a4d741b1fc955f78271a4fa3d2df">also see a few initial measurements I made with the "optfilc" tools</a> -- I did less-micro benchmarks and found a wider range), especially stuff that's IO bound or not otherwise straining for maximum performance.</p><p>I'm happy to see this work exist. It builds on a long line of <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1543135.1542504">academic</a> and <a href="https://cheri-alliance.org/">industrial</a> work in this space (that Pizlo happily cites), including his own many years of iteration on the subject while at Apple. If I understand correctly, some of those earlier iterations are <a href="https://saaramar.github.io/iBoot_firebloom/">already in production in security sensitive code</a>. I recall talking with Pizlo about these prototypes when I was at Apple too, and I'm pleased to see the work maturing to its current state.</p><p>(He also makes an interesting point that the bounds checking Fil-C inserts can make pointer-twiddling C code safer than pointer-twiddling unsafe Rust. This seems likely true! And it would be interesting to know if there's a way to have the best of both worlds, eg. if his instrumentation pass could be adapted to compile otherwise-full-speed optimized unsafe Rust blocks with a little bit of systematic compiler-injected bounds checking, perhaps derived from Rust's strict pointer provenance? Obviously this wouldn't be appealing for folks who use unsafe blocks for speed, but I think a lot are for other reasons and might enjoy an extra layer of checks. This is well beyond anything I know anymore, sadly I've long since lost track of what rustc can or can't do. Just speculating, but it seems to me that most unsafe Rust code doesn't allocate or free or interact with an allocator at all, so you'd want to drive it from something other than allocator, could probably still omit the GC.)</p><p>Naturally Fil-C has some caveats (if we're comparing to Rust, say, or other PLs with restrictions on mutable aliasing):</p><ol><br><li>It's not going to <em>statically</em> prevent any of the errors it prevents; it's strictly dynamic. So your programs will still crash on memory errors. But almost all programs have paths that crash, and perhaps the density of crashes will be tolerable.</li><br><li>In addition to the stated performance overheads there will be a space overhead, as deferring frees until the GC is sure they're garbage (unreachable) will retain that garbage for a while. On most GCs the amount of memory spent on garbage is tunable: make the GC work more often and there's less retained garbage, but typical GC tuning will put the overhead at 1.5x-2x the memory. <strike>I haven't measured Fil-C-compiled code at all to see what its overheads are here</strike> EDIT: see measurements above, also included memory, looks to be more like 3-6x?) Anyway computers do have a lot of memory these days.</li><br><li>It's not going to do anything much to solve data races or help with <a href="https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/312681.html">local reasoning for correctness</a>. Preventing mutable aliasing has additional correctness advantages beyond being a tool for memory safety. Fearless concurrency remains out of reach. But perhaps it's less fearful since you'll only crash or get data corruption.</li><br><li>There'll be a big obvious switch you can flip -- compile <em>without</em> Fil-C -- to turn the safety back off everywhere to make the program faster and use less memory. There will be a lot of temptation from bosses who like to see better numbers to flip that switch. But perhaps bosses in 2025 are safety conscious enough to leave it on.</li><br></ol><p>In any event, I only mention those caveats because they're the sort of thing that motivated languages like Rust in the first place. There have been memory-safe, bounds-checked and GC'ed AOT-compiled languages for a long time! And I like them! I'm happy to code in Haskell or OCaml or SBCL or Modula-3 or Java or C# or whatever. The main problem motivating Rust was that there was an audience of developers who <em>wouldn't accept those PLs</em> for their use cases. People were very <em>very</em> attached to their C/C++ performance and memory-usage envelopes. Like there are (or were) a lot of people who argue against having frame pointers too. It's weird! The gap between C/C++ and the next-fastest safe PL has never been especially huge, it's never anything like the performance gaps between different generations of hardware. But it persists across time, and it's been enough for decades to sustain the "we have to be unsafe" argument. </p><p>If times have changed and people are now mostly ok with the caveats and will throw the switch to turn safety on, I'm super happy for that to be true! Code that fails more-safely on memory errors is a great thing for human civilization. For people who have huge legacy C/C++ codebases with no ability or desire to rewrite, or even are writing anew but feel constrained to avoid (or just don't like) safer PLs, I hope Fil-C meets their needs. If at some point (say) there's an easy-to-install Debian distro built with this, I'll probably use it.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text_-1266136426" data-emptytext="Text"><p>Memory loss may not simply be a symptom of getting older. New research from Virginia Tech shows that it’s tied to specific molecular changes in the brain and that adjusting those processes can improve memory.</p>
<p>In two complementary studies,&nbsp;<a href="https://sas.vt.edu/people/faculty/jarome-timothy.html">Timothy Jarome</a>, associate professor in the&nbsp;<a href="http://cals.vt.edu/">College of Agriculture and Life Sciences</a>’&nbsp;<a href="http://sas.vt.edu/">School of Animal Sciences</a>, and his graduate students used gene-editing tools to target those age-related changes to improve memory performance in older subjects. The work was conducted on rats, a standard model for studying how memory changes with age.</p>
<p>“Memory loss affects more than a third of people over 70, and it’s a major risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease,” said Jarome, who also holds an appointment in the&nbsp;<a href="https://neuroscience.vt.edu/">School of Neuroscience</a>. “This work shows that memory decline is linked to specific molecular changes that can be targeted and studied.&nbsp;If we can understand what’s driving it at the molecular level, we can start to understand what goes wrong in dementia and eventually use that knowledge to guide new approaches to treatment.”</p>
</div><div id="text_1518939200_270038343" data-emptytext="Text"><h2>Targeting memory loss in two key brain regions</h2>
<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibroneuroscience.org/article/S0306-4522(25)00714-6/abstract">the first study</a>, published in&nbsp;the journal Neuroscience&nbsp;and led by Jarome and doctoral student Yeeun Bae, the team examined a process called K63 polyubiquitination. This process acts as a molecular tagging system that tells proteins inside the brain how to behave. When the system functions normally, it helps brain cells communicate and form memories.</p>
<p>Jarome and his team found that aging disrupts K63 polyubiquitination in two distinct areas of the brain. In the&nbsp;hippocampus, which helps form and retrieve memories, levels of K63 polyubiquitination&nbsp;increase&nbsp;with age. Using the&nbsp;CRISPR-dCas13 RNA editing system&nbsp;to reduce these levels, the researchers were able to improve memory in older rats.</p>
<p>In the amygdala, which is important for emotional memory, the researchers noted that K63 polyubiquitination declines with age. By reducing it even further, they were able to boost&nbsp;memory in older rats.</p>
<p>“Together, these findings reveal the important functions of K63 polyubiquitination in the brain’s aging process,”&nbsp;Jarome said. “In both regions, adjusting this one molecular process helped improve memory.”</p>
</div><div id="text_1356740091_434642113" data-emptytext="Text"><h2>Reactivating a gene that supports memory</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361923025003211?via%3Dihub">A second study</a>, published in&nbsp;the Brain Research Bulletin&nbsp;and led by Jarome with doctoral student Shannon Kincaid, focused on IGF2, a growth-factor gene that supports memory formation. As the brain ages, IGF2 activity drops as the gene becomes chemically silenced in the hippocampus.</p>
<p>“IGF2 is one of a small number of genes in our DNA that’s imprinted, which means it’s expressed from only one parental copy,” Jarome said. “When that single copy starts to shut down with age, you lose its benefit.”</p>
<p>The researchers found that this silencing happens through DNA methylation, a natural process in which chemical tags accumulate on the gene and switch it off. Using a precise gene-editing tool, CRISPR-dCas9, they removed those tags and reactivated the gene. The result was better memory in older rats.</p>
<p>“We essentially turned the gene back on,” Jarome said. “When we did that, the older animals performed much better. Middle-aged animals that didn’t yet have memory problems weren’t affected, which tells us timing matters. You have to intervene when things start to go wrong.”</p>
<p>Together, the two studies show that memory loss is not caused by a single molecule or pathway and that multiple molecular systems likely contribute to how the brain ages.</p>
<p>“We tend to look at one molecule at a time, but the reality is that many things are happening at once,” he said. “If we want to understand why memory declines with age or why we develop Alzheimer’s disease, we have to look at the broader picture.”</p>
<h2>Collaborative, graduate-led research</h2>
<p>Both studies were driven by graduate researchers in Jarome’s lab and supported through collaborations with scientists at Rosalind Franklin University, Indiana University, and Penn State.&nbsp;Yeeun Bae, who completed her doctoral work with Jarome in the&nbsp;<a href="http://sas.vt.edu/">School of Animal Sciences</a>, led the study on K63 polyubiquitination.&nbsp;Shannon Kincaid, a doctoral student in the same program, led the study on IGF2.</p>
<p>“These projects represent the kind of graduate-led, collaborative research that defines our work,” Jarome said. “Our students are deeply involved in designing experiments, analyzing data, and helping shape the scientific questions we pursue.”</p>
<p>The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the American Federation for Aging Research.</p>
<p>“Everyone has some memory decline as they get older,” he said. “But when it becomes abnormal, the risk for Alzheimer’s disease rises. What we’re learning is that some of those changes happening at a molecular level can be corrected — and that gives us a path forward to potential treatments.”</p>

<p><span>By the spring of 2022,</span> Ed Aldag was fed up. The 61-year-old CEO of a multibillion-dollar real estate company called Medical Properties Trust, Aldag is a high-society fixture in the company’s hometown of Birmingham, Alabama, where MPT has donated millions to local nonprofits and where he’s regularly listed as one of the city’s most influential businessmen. But for years, Aldag had watched as MPT faced tough questions from the federal government, investors, and, most recently, a series of articles in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MPT makes money by acting as a landlord: It buys hospitals and then rents the facilities back to providers. Over the previous year, the <em>Journal</em> had published several stories that focused on the company’s finances, including reporting that dug into MPT’s biggest tenant—Steward Health Care, then one of the largest for-profit hospital operators in the nation—and the unusually close financial relationship between the two companies.</p>



<p>The <em>Journal</em>’s pieces raised concerns about whether Steward was struggling—and whether MPT was engaging in secret transactions to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/pe-backed-hospital-chain-got-help-from-major-landlord-as-losses-mounted-11624014000">keep it afloat</a>. <em>Mother Jones</em> and others would later report how<strong> </strong>Steward’s financial mismanagement harmed hundreds of people: We found <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/05/steward-health-care-medical-properties-trust-hospitals-bankruptcy-ralph-de-la-torre/">83 deaths across its 39 hospitals</a>, hundreds of malpractice lawsuits, and more than 700 patient care problems documented in federal hospital inspections. The <em>Journal</em>, meanwhile, was the first to notice this mismanagement at work, revealing that Steward hospitals owed <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/pe-backed-hospital-chain-got-help-from-major-landlord-as-losses-mounted-11624014000?mod=author_content_page_12_pos_7">nearly $1 billion</a> to medical supply companies and other vendors.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>In one tense email exchange in March 2022, Aldag wrote to a PR firm, “We cannot let a deranged pretend journalist tell a false story of MPT.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>That reporting was the beginning of years of intense scrutiny of MPT in the world of finance that hurt the company’s stock price and eventually led, earlier this month, to a trio of <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/markey-sanders-blumenthal-introduce-legislation-to-protect-health-systems-from-predatory-real-estate-investment-trust-deals">Democratic US senators proposing</a> the “Stop Medical Profiteering and Theft (MPT) Act” to impose limits on the company’s business. But it was also the apparent start of an aggressive, previously unreported campaign by Steward, MPT, and other still-unknown actors to silence their critics. Internal documents obtained by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and shared with <em>Mother Jones</em> show that MPT amassed an army of crisis management professionals to protect its reputation, eventually working alongside three different crisis public relations firms, five law firms, and two private intelligence firms. The documents, along with information from sources close to this effort, show a major effort to control the narrative: In one tense email exchange in March 2022, Aldag wrote to a PR firm, “We cannot let a deranged pretend journalist tell a false story of MPT.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of a social media push that used anonymous accounts to discredit and intimidate the growing chorus of journalists, investment analysts, and short sellers who questioned the company, an intelligence firm baited<strong> </strong>MPT’s detractors online.<strong> </strong>And while the <em><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/07/01/metro/steward-health-care-surveillance-intelligence-gathering/">Boston Globe</a></em> and <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/scoop/claims-about-short-seller-made-in-uk-parliament-can-be-traced-back-to-private-intelligence-firm-hired-by-steward-health-care#:~:text=But%20now%2C%20leaked%20communications%20obtained,content%20about%20him%20on%20Twitter.">OCCRP</a> reported last year that Steward paid the British firm Audere International to surveil one particularly provocative MPT critic, new documents show a much broader tracking campaign, funded in part by Steward and other shadowy actors but focused on MPT, targeting a half dozen of the company’s skeptics.</p>







<p>“They were always looking for something explosive that would make things go away,” a source close to Audere wrote in messages reviewed by <em>Mother Jones</em> that were confirmed with the source directly. “Although Steward was the customer, it was clear that MPT was what Audere was protecting.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>An MPT spokesperson did not respond to a detailed list of questions but made clear in an emailed statement that the company disagrees with the many critics questioning its business practices. The company, the spokesperson said, “has unfailingly disclosed each of its transactions as and when required under applicable securities laws.”</p>



<p>The spokesperson also said that as criticism of MPT has mounted, its executives and their families have been harassed, including receiving death threats: “As any responsible company in that position would do, we have periodically engaged advisors to help navigate this situation.” The spokesperson added: “It is critical to note that MPT has never directly or indirectly engaged with detractors on social media, nor have we paid any third-party to do so.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company’s damage control started in earnest with the lead reporter behind the <em>Journal</em>’s stories, Brian Spegele. His reporting on MPT began in 2021, when a number of its tenant hospitals across the country—a Steward hospital in Pennsylvania, and ones owned by other for-profit operators in Wyoming and Rhode Island—all seemed to be running into financial issues. While these facilities struggled, MPT was hitting its highest stock price ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>MPT leaders asked their PR firm to suss out the angle of Spegele’s upcoming article and questioned whether the <em>Journal</em> was working to short their stock.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Spegele emailed MPT with questions about how it was running its business—and how it might be affecting hospitals. He’d heard from insiders that MPT was overpaying for hospitals because higher sale values meant they could charge higher rents. Did the company want to comment? Why had one of their hospitals in Ohio shut down not long after it started renting from MPT? Did the company really have three corporate jets?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In dozens of leaked emails, Aldag strategized with other leaders over how to respond. They brought in the crisis PR firm Joele Frank to help, as well as a law firm that specializes in filing defamation cases against journalists, Clare Locke. They asked their PR firm to speak with Spegele and suss out the angle of his upcoming article and questioned whether the <em>Journal</em> was working to short their stock. Was the paper hinting to investors that MPT was going to fail?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2021, Clare Locke sent a letter to the <em>Journal</em>’s legal team and top editors, threatening to sue the paper before Spegele had even published his next story and demanding that he reveal his sources. The following month, MPT’s stock hit a new high: about $24 per share. Not long after, the paper’s lawyer sent an email to Clare Locke, noting that Spegele had experienced “some security concerns,” and he wanted to discuss them on the phone. (Spegele declined to comment; a <em>Wall Street Journal </em>spokesperson did not answer specific questions but noted, “The safety and security of our reporters is of paramount importance. While we won’t discuss the details of the protective measures we take, we stand by the <em>Journal</em>’s in-depth and consequential reporting on Medical Properties Trust.” Clare Locke and Joele Frank also did not respond to questions.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>Journal</em> published Spegele’s piece in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/hospitals-private-equity-reit-mpt-steward-11644849598?mod=author_content_page_11_pos_7">February 2022</a>. It claimed that MPT was quietly infusing hundreds of millions into Steward through complex loans and other means, enabling its hospitals to continue to pay rent. This meant that MPT’s largest tenant was actually struggling, which boded poorly for MPT, as well. Yet the article also pointed out executives’ excessive spending on things like Aldag’s multimillion-dollar salary and the regular use of the company’s private jets. Investors started emailing and calling MPT, and its stock price began to slide.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“We already know what he is going to say and I refuse to let him tell the story…” Aldag wrote. “We need to devise a plan to be proactive in our storytelling.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Spegele soon started working on another story, about an MPT-owned hospital in California. His continued requests for comment angered Aldag.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m tired of this guy,” Aldag wrote, adding that the former employees Spegele had cited anonymously were “absolutely fake.” Then he called his team to action: “We already know what he is going to say and I refuse to let him tell the story…We need to devise a plan to be proactive in our storytelling outside of the WSJ.” He told his PR advisers that if this wasn’t a project they could take on, he imagined they could find other companies to help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ladies,” he wrote, “it’s time we go on the offensive.”</p>



<p><span>Investment analyst Rob Simone </span>thought there was something to the <em>Journal</em>’s<em> </em>stories. He worked at a research firm called Hedgeye, and soon he started digging into whatever public information he could find about MPT.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He was struck by the fact that MPT seemed to be at the root of Steward’s financial issues—and its hospitals’ increasing problems paying their bills. According to our own analysis, by 2022, at least four health care companies that had lease agreements with MPT had gone bankrupt, shutting down hospitals or throwing them into uncertainty.</p>



<p>Simone told Hedgeye’s paid subscribers in April 2022 that MPT was sinking hospitals instead of helping them, by saddling their operations with leases they couldn’t afford. He claimed that beneath its veneer of success, Steward “appears to be insolvent” and that its dwindling finances likely meant future trouble for MPT, which he suggested was quietly infusing money into Steward to help it pay rent. And he wondered about the compensation that MPT’s board of directors (which includes Aldag and the company’s CFO) had green-lit for executives, while Steward and some of their other tenants were financially struggling. He recommended shorting the stock.</p>



<p>“I just started doing work on this and became fascinated and thought it was a real problem—and that problem kept getting worse, and so I kept writing about it,” Simone told us when we spoke last year. “It never, never, ever improved.”</p>



<p>MPT leadership pilloried Simone’s research on the company’s next earnings call. But Simone’s reports about MPT continued to gain traction on Twitter and investing websites, especially as the company’s stock price started to dip, from around $20 to $15 in the summer of 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>But as more investors began to short MPT and drag down its stock price, Audere’s work increasingly focused on those critical of the publicly traded landlord.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>And Simone wasn’t alone. A writer who called himself @BigRiverCapita1 was making similar claims on social media and Wall Street blogs. The account was anonymous but clearly well versed in finance, pointing out past bankruptcies of MPT’s tenants and questioning whether these hospitals were struggling, shutting down, or cutting back patient care due to their pricey leases with MPT.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Around then is when Audere, the British private intelligence firm, got involved. According to OCCRP and the <em>Boston Globe,</em> Steward had already been paying Audere to surveil its critics for a few years—eventually spending more than $7 million on these operations. But as Big River’s posts and Simone’s research spread, and more investors began to short MPT and drag down its stock price, Audere’s work increasingly focused on those critical of the publicly traded landlord, even as its tenant Steward remained Audere’s client, according to leaked documents and sources close to Audere. (An Audere spokesperson told <em>Mother Jones</em> that the company cannot answer questions about its confidential work, but that Audere “takes its legal and regulatory compliance obligations seriously and acts in accordance with the same.”)</p>



<p>In June 2022, Audere hired a contractor to start looking into these critics, leaked emails show. They named the operation “Project Morden.” They told the contractor they had two main goals: Dig into why Rob Simone was writing about MPW (they referred to MPT by its stock ticker symbol), and identify the person behind @BigRiverCapita1:</p>

Great to see you earlier.

As discussed, please find attached: (1) Rob Simone background and (2) WS' article, featuring
Apollo Global Management Inc.

To reiterate, our aim is to:

1. Understand Rob Simone's: (1) intentions regarding MPW, (2) whether this is a long-term investigation project for him or just temporarily, (3) what else is he planning to publish on MPW and (4) whether this is his own interest or past to him from his boss?
2. Identify who is behind the Twitter account: @BigRiverCapita 1
Linked to the above, please let me know what time on Wednesday you would like to speak.

Many thanks and all the best,

<p>A strategy memo noted that “multiple financial professionals believe that RS [Rob Simone] does not have the capacity to drive MPW downward.” Still, the firm demanded an aggressive approach to Big River and Simone, whom they deemed Target 1 and Target 2.</p>



<p>“Uncover the subjects (sic) vulnerabilities and pressure points,” the memo urged, suggesting the contractor unearth details about “career, integrity, personal life and identify any potential misconduct.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Anonymous Twitter accounts started to follow and harass Simone, asking if he had security and even tweeting, “his life [was] in danger.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>And that, Simone said, is when the trouble started.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonymous Twitter accounts started to follow and harass him, asking if he had security and even tweeting that “his life [was] in danger.” Simone’s company, Hedgeye, grew concerned about this safety and provided him with enhanced security, but neither they nor Simone ever figured out who was behind the accounts. One tweet even warned&nbsp;that if he didn’t stop reporting and tweeting about MPT, “he could end up like Daphne,” an allusion to the murder of the Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed after reporting on a Steward hospital deal in Malta in 2017.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MPT’s leaders also began to meticulously track their detractors. By October 2022, they were keeping tabs on all the skeptics dialing in to their public earnings calls and even discussed not taking their questions: “Please make us a list of all the bad actors that listened in,” Aldag wrote to top executives in an email. They sent back a lengthy list that included nearly 20 professional financial analysts, including Simone.</p>






<p>The following month, MPT received Audere’s intelligence reports over email. And soon, Audere further ramped up its campaign against Simone, even hiring a contractor to create a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230411163951/https://hedgespy.medium.com/">fake blog</a> written from the perspective of a woman trying to hold investment analysts to account. But its true goal was to criticize just one player: Hedgeye. It was called “Hedge Spy.” (After <em>Mother Jones </em>and <em>Reveal</em> mentioned this contractor’s work in previous reporting, the blog was <a href="https://hedgespy.medium.com/">taken down</a> from the internet.)</p>



<p>Initially the blog was populated with stories that cast doubt on a variety of firms, as the contract writer explained to Audere in emails reviewed by <em>Mother Jones</em>. “The more general content will disguise the blog’s objective,” wrote the contractor.</p>



<p>The contractor also launched a Reddit account, Loud-Peanut-7716, whose goal was “to actively engage in discussions and facilitate the conversations concerning Hedgeye.” In an email to Audere, the contractor listed some of the Reddit posts trying to discredit Simone’s firm:</p>



<p>“Can you recommend any research platforms? I tried Hedgeye but I don’t trust them after their recent dirty tricks stalking and intimidating their competitors”</p>



<p>“They don’t care about making us rich, they want to make THEMSELVES rich! DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!”</p>



<p><span>At the start of 2023,</span> a new critic took on MPT, publishing a series of reports with cheeky titles and provocative tweets that alleged MPT was committing a brazen financial fraud.</p>



<p>That voice was a British investor named Fraser Perring. Perring runs a short-selling firm called Viceroy Research that makes big financial bets on companies it thinks will fail, digging deep into their financials to see if they might be hiding something. He has tens of thousands of followers on social media, where he often posts his findings and claims of corporate wrongdoing.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Management soon would help fuel a conspiracy theory that was already growing at MPT: that their critics were working together to short their stock.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In January of that year, Viceroy published the first of what would be several reports on MPT. Titled “Medical Properties (dis)Trust,” the report arrived at many of the same conclusions that had been swirling around Wall Street: Steward was going belly up, and MPT seemed to be secretly funneling it money to stave off bankruptcy. And perhaps more clearly than anyone before, Viceroy accused MPT of “round-tripping”: Not only was it loaning money to help Steward pay rent, but it was then recording this rent as new earnings and not disclosing it, all to maintain the illusion that it was a healthy landlord.</p>



<p>Viceroy’s report sent MPT executives into a tizzy. Leaked documents show the company was scrutinizing Perring’s tweets alleging round-tripping, with executives furiously sharing them with one another and one of their PR firms compiling them all.</p>



<p>Management soon would help fuel a conspiracy theory that was already growing at MPT: that their critics—from Simone to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>—were working together to short their stock and bring them down.</p>



<p>Around that time, social media trolling of Simone and Perring ramped up. On top of that, reporting from the <em>Boston</em> <em>Globe</em> and OCCRP shows that a security firm contracted by Audere videotaped Perring at his home and watched him around his neighborhood—even following him and his daughter on their way back from school. When MPT <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67117032/medical-properties-trust-inc-v-viceroy-research-llc/">sued Viceroy</a> the following month for defamation, it denied all of Perring’s findings, writing that they were “malicious fiction” and had “caused serious harm to MPT.” But during litigation, according to <a href="https://viceroyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1-3.pdf">court documents</a>, Viceroy’s lawyers said an impostor had called Perring’s bank in the weeks leading up to MPT’s suit and pretended to be him. It’s unclear who was behind the impostor, who was able to gain access to Perring’s financial transactions; soon those details were included in a report sent to Audere. No money was stolen, but in reports to Audere the impersonator tried to figure out what Perring was spending his money on. (MPT, which agreed to settle the defamation case last December, said in a statement that it hired Audere in late 2022 for work unrelated to Perring.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>A few months later, when JP Morgan recommended that investors view the company’s stock with caution, emails show that MPT’s top executives circulated a lengthy list of analysts they believed were somehow connected to each other. They named five different investment funds and investors, and the many possible ways they were “connected”—to each other, to a <em>Journal</em> reporter, to Hedgeye, to Viceroy, even to liberal megadonor George Soros. And they wondered if anyone in their “army of advisors” had an in with regulators. Included on that email chain was exactly that kind of connection, someone who used to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: Mick Mulvaney.</p>



<p>Mulvaney, who also had been President Donald Trump’s acting chief of staff, was helping to run a consulting firm called Actum. Leaked emails show that MPT brought Actum on to help it “combat” what they saw as people conspiring to target the company. To counter their criticisms, Actum drafted a white paper praising MPT, calling it a company “investing in the future of health care and communities.” (Actum did not respond to questions from <em>Mother Jones</em>.)</p>



<p>Reputation management is common among publicly traded companies, notes Jo-Ellen Pozner, a professor of business at Santa Clara University who studies corporate conduct and ethics. But the scale and expense of the effort to manage MPT’s PR crises is “unequivocally not normal,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>After years of high rents to MPT, hospitals had failed to pay on-call doctors, nurse staffing agencies, repairmen, and suppliers of everything from blood to hospital beds.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>“The fact that these folks were so willing to waste company resources—spend significant amounts of money that could have been diverted to more productive uses—to investigate journalists, to investigate investment analysts, it suggests to me that they are spying, and think that everybody else is doing the same,” Pozner said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While MPT focused on its value and reputation, patient care issues at its Steward hospitals began to reach crisis levels. Under the weight of years of high rents to MPT, these facilities had failed to pay on-call doctors, nurse staffing agencies, repairmen, and suppliers of everything from blood to hospital beds. Eventually, some Steward hospitals couldn’t afford to keep paying MPT rent and closed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These troubles further drove MPT’s stock price down. In October 2023, when it dipped below $5, Aldag recorded a message to shareholders, telling them he remained confident in “MPT’s proven business model” for investing in and improving hospitals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At one of them, St. Elizabeth’s in Massachusetts, a crisis had begun to unfold. The hospital owed more than $500,000 to a company that made devices used to stem internal bleeding called embolism coils; the supplier recently had come to repossess the coils.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two weeks after Aldag posted the video reassuring shareholders, a first-time mom named Sungida Rashid delivered a baby girl at St. Elizabeth’s. Hours later, Rashid began to bleed severely, doctors discovered they didn’t have the embolism coil needed to treat her, and <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/01/25/business/steward-health-care-mother-death/">she died</a>. Her family’s tragedy would set in motion articles and hearings and subpoenas trying to understand the financial dealings of MPT and Steward. It had taken years—and a mother’s life—for the story to finally come to light.&nbsp;</p>
