<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/orwell_george.shtml">George Orwell</a>‘s novella <em><a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/Animal_Farm/0.html">Animal Farm</a></em> (1945) was a political fable. The cleverly portrayed animals who chase off the farmer and try to run the farm as a utopia slowly begin to replicate all the attitudes and practices against which they had rebelled. The story, summarized <a href="https://interestingliterature.com/2020/05/a-summary-and-analysis-of-george-orwells-animal-farm/">here,</a> satirizes the Soviet Union’s transition from revolution to totalitarianism under Joseph Stalin (1878–1953). In fact, the animal characters and incidents are often allusions to <a href="https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/what-some-examples-allusions-book-animal-farm-349433">historical Soviet figures and events.</a></p>

<p>His Preface, <a href="https://orwell.ru/library/novels/Animal_Farm/english/efp_go">“The Freedom of the Press,”</a> was omitted from the first edition of the book, then disappeared, and <a href="https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/orwells-proposed-introduction-to-animal-farm">was not rediscovered until 1971.</a> From it, we learn that Orwell had considerable difficulty getting his fable published. That wasn’t principally because of wartime issues. There was a shortage of books and his was highly readable. Rather, British intellectuals of the day did not wish to hear any criticism of Stalin or allusions to his atrocities:</p>



<p>Obviously it is not desirable that a government department should have any power of censorship (except security censorship, which no one objects to in war time) over books which are not officially sponsored. But the chief danger to freedom of thought and speech at this moment is not the direct interference of the MOI or any official body. If publishers and editors exert themselves to keep certain topics out of print, it is not because they are frightened of prosecution but because they are frightened of public opinion. In this country intellectual cowardice is the worst enemy a writer or journalist has to face, and that fact does not seem to me to have had the discussion it deserves…</p>

<p>At this moment what is demanded by the prevailing orthodoxy is an uncritical admiration of Soviet Russia. Everyone knows this, nearly everyone acts on it. Any serious criticism of the Soviet régime, any disclosure of facts which the Soviet government would prefer to keep hidden, is next door to unprintable. And this nation-wide conspiracy to flatter our ally takes place, curiously enough, against a background of genuine intellectual tolerance. For though you arc not allowed to criticise the Soviet government, at least you are reasonably free to criticise our own. Hardly anyone will print an attack on Stalin, but it is quite safe to attack Churchill, at any rate in books and periodicals. And throughout five years of war, during two or three of which we were fighting for national survival, countless books, pamphlets and articles advocating a compromise peace have been published without interference. More, they have been published without exciting much disapproval. So long as the prestige of the USSR is not involved, the principle of free speech has been reasonably well upheld. There are other forbidden topics, and I shall mention some of them presently, but the prevailing attitude towards the USSR is much the most serious symptom. It is, as it were, spontaneous, and is not due to the action of any pressure group. </p>



<p>Orwell, it should be said, was very much a man of the Left. But he was not a totalitarian. That combination perhaps enabled him to publish some of the most broadly appealing  popular-level dissections of the evils of totalitarian rule in English.</p>



<p>For example, he offers us a significant insight in the passage above. The censorship he had to address was not a conspiracy or even a campaign; it was spontaneous. Every right-thinking intellectual somehow <em>knew</em> that a candid assessment of Soviet rule was, well, just <em>not the done thing!…</em></p>



<p>Why not? Well, gentle reader, if you have ever encountered such an environment, you will know — or suspect anyway — that most of the people who know for sure which political views need censoring could not ably defend their opinion. Their defense is, precisely, groupthink. They don’t need to think much about it individually. And they don’t. In fact, if you challenge them on their censorship, they may act aggrieved, as if they were the victims of a calculated personal injury. It’s doubtless all the more tiresome if, as Orwell found, the groupthinkers are held up as the leading intellectuals of the day:</p>



<p>But now to come back to this book of mine. The reaction towards it of most English intellectuals will be quite simple: ‘It oughtn’t to have been published.’ Naturally, those reviewers who understand the art of denigration will not attack it on political grounds but on literary ones. They will say that it is a dull, silly book and a disgraceful waste of paper. This may well be true, but it is obviously not [th]e whole of the story. One does not say that a book ‘ought not to have been published’ merely because it is a bad book. After all, acres of rubbish are printed daily and no one bothers. The English intelligentsia, or most of them, will object to this book because it traduces their Leader and (as they see it) does harm to the cause of progress. If it did [th]e opposite they would have nothing to say against it, even if its literary faults were ten times as glaring as they are. The success of, for instance, the Left Book Club over a period of four or five years shows how willing they are to tolerate both scurrility and slipshod writing, provided that it tells them what they want to hear.</p>



<p>And he ends his Preface on a high note,</p>



<p>I know that the English intelligentsia have plenty of reason for their timidity and dishonesty, indeed I know by heart the arguments by which they justify themselves. But at least let us have no more nonsense about defending liberty against Fascism. If liberty means anything at all it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.</p>



<p>Orwell would doubtless be pleased that millions of people worldwide have offered a much more positive assessment of <em>Animal Farm.</em> Many of us might also find key points of comparison between his situation and the shrill calls for censorship that we hear so often today.</p>

<center><i>This is the story of a woman who made amazing contributions
to society,<br>
in spite of intense ostracism and stigmatization just for trying
to be herself, <br>
and how she did it by taking on a secret new identity, and living
her life in "stealth mode".</i></center>

<center>#</center>

<p>
<a href="http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/Awards/ElectronicDesign/HallOfFame.html">Lynn Conway is a 
<span>famed pioneer of 
microelectronics chip design</span></a>.
Her innovations during the 1970's at the Xerox Palo Alto Research
Center (PARC) have impacted chip design worldwide. Many high-tech
companies and computing methods have foundations in her work.</p>

<p>Thousands of chip designers learned their craft from Lynn's
textbook <i>Introduction to VLSI Systems</i>, which she co-authored
with Prof. Carver Mead of Caltech. Thousands more did their first
VLSI design projects using the government's MOSIS prototyping
system, which is based directly on Lynn's work at PARC. 
<span>
<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9046420">
Much of the modern silicon chip design revolution is based on her work</a></span>.</p>

<p>Lynn went on to win many awards and high honors, including
election as a Member of the National Academy of Engineering, the
highest professional recognition an engineer can receive.</p>

<center>#</center>

<p>What no one knew till recently is that Lynn also did earlier
pioneering research at IBM in the 1960's. Fresh out of grad school,
she invented a powerful method for issuing multiple out-of-order
instructions per machine cycle in supercomputers. By solving this
fundamental computer architecture problem way back in 1965, she
made possible the creation of the first true superscalar computer,
and participated in its design at IBM. Lynn called her invention
dynamic instruction scheduling (DIS).</p>

<p>By the 90's, chips held enough transistors so that entire superscalar
computers could be put on single chips. Lynn's DIS invention suddenly
became used in almost all the powerful new PC chips, making them
much more powerful than they'd otherwise have been. Lynn's work
thus had yet another big impact on the modern information technology
revolution.</p>

<p>Most computer engineers thought DIS was a generalization of
decades of work, and had no idea it had been invented in 1965.
It caused Lynn great angst to see her wonderful invention so widely
used, and described in all the computer architecture textbooks,
without anyone knowing it was her idea.</p>

<center>#</center>

<p>How could this oversight have happened? Why did Lynn remain
silent for over three decades about her IBM work?</p>

<p>The answer is that women like Lynn have lived, especially in
the past, in a holocaust of stigmatization, persecution and violence.
They could not reveal their past identities without risking great
physical danger to themselves, and great harm to their careers
and their personal relationships.</p>

<p>You see, Lynn was born and raised as a boy. It was a terrible
mistake, because Lynn had the brain-sex and gender identity of
a girl. However, back in the forties and fifties there wasn't
any knowledge about such things, and Lynn was forced to grow up
as a boy. She did the best she could at it, but suffered terribly
from what was happening to her. She was still a boy and had a
boy's name when she worked at IBM.</p>

<p>After years and years of trying to find help, she finally connected
with the pioneering physician Harry Benjamin, M.D. in 1966, shortly
after he'd published his seminal textbook <i>The Transsexual Phenomenon</i>.
That text was the first to describe the true nature of, and medical
solutions for, Lynn's mis-gendering affliction.</p>

<p>With Dr. Benjamin's help, Lynn began medical treatments in
1967. She became one of the very early transsexual women to undergo
hormonal and surgical sex reassignment to have her body completely
changed from that of a boy into that of a woman. Sadly, just before
Lynn underwent sex reassignment surgery in 1968, she was fired
by IBM for being transsexual and lost all connections to her important
work there.</p>

<center>#</center>

<p>Lynn's case was a first at IBM. The idea that a professional
person would seek a "sex change" totally shocked IBM's
management. Most transsexual women seeking help back then were
from among those who worked as "female impersonators"
or as prostitutes. Only those who were sure they could fully pass
as women, who were totally desperate and who had nothing to lose,
dared to change gender back then. When top IBM management learned
what Lynn was doing, she was fired in a maelstrom of animosity.
It is almost certain that the decision was made by T. J. Watson,
Jr., himself.</p>

<p>Lynn had managed to put together some fragile bits of support
and help from her family and friends. However, when IBM fired
her everyone lost confidence in what she was doing and her support
system collapsed. Lynn went abroad for her surgery, all alone.
She had lost not only her career and professional reputation,
but also her family, relatives, friends and colleagues. She faced
a frighteningly uncertain future without a soul in the world to
help her other than her doctors.</p>

<center>#</center>

<p>When Lynn returned, she made her social transition and took
on her new name. She started her career all over again as a lowly
contract programmer without a past. A gritty survivor, her adjustment
in her new role went completely against the dire predictions of
the IBM executives and all the family and the friends who had
deserted her. All alone she went out into the world, made new
friends and worked hard to succeed in her new life.</p>

<p>Amazingly, Lynn became so happy, and so full of life and hope
after her transformation, that her career took off like a rocket.
Moving up through a series of companies, she landed a computer
architecture job at Memorex in 1971. In 1973, she was recruited
by Xerox's exciting new Palo Alto Research Center, just as it
was forming.</p>

<p>By 1978, just 10 years after her gender transition, Lynn was
already on the verge of international fame in her field for her
VLSI innovations. By then she was writing the seminal textbook
on the subject, and was heading off to M. I. T. to teach the first
prototype course on VLSI systems.</p>

<p>Within two years, universities all over the world were adopting
her text for similar courses. The Department of Defense started
a major new program to sponsor research to build on her work.
Scores of startup companies began incubating and forming to commercialize
the knowledge. All this happened without people catching on to
Lynn's secret past. She could never have survived and done it
if they had.</p>

<center>#</center>

<p>In the 80's and 90's, Lynn went on to enjoy a wide-ranging,
influential career, and a wonderfully adventurous, fulfilling
and happy personal life. She is now Professor of Electrical Engineering
and Computer Science, Emerita, at the University of Michigan in
Ann Arbor, where she also served for many years as Associate Dean
of Engineering. She now lives on country property in rural Michigan
with her husband Charlie. They've been together since 1987.</p>

<p>However, for 31 years after her transition, Lynn carefully
remained in "stealth mode". Only her closest friends
knew about her past. Lynn knew of other transsexual women who
had been socially ostracized, ghettoized, beaten, gang-raped,
murdered or driven to suicide when "read" or otherwise
discovered by brutal, hateful people.</p>

<p>For years Lynn lived with an ever-present sense of danger,
fearful that exposure of her past could cause her to lose her
civil rights, legal rights and employment rights, and to suffer
estrangements in her professional and personal relationships.</p>

<center>#</center>

<p>In 1999, computer historians finally stumbled into Lynn's early
IBM work. They tracked it down to her, and her past was revealed
amongst her colleagues. Frightened at first, she gradually realized
times might have changed enough that she needn't be afraid to
be "out" now. She certainly has nothing at all to be
ashamed of, and is indeed very proud of the successes in her personal
life as well as those in her career.</p>

<p>At the same time, Lynn was dismayed that transsexual women
are still treated so inhumanely by parents, relatives, employers,
the legal system and society at large. The total rejection of teenage 
transgender and transsexual girls-to-be by their families is especially tragic,
since it often happens just as they first cry out for
help, and can doom them to years of marginalized existence.</p>

<p>Lynn began to think that her story might help somehow. Societal
views are partly a media problem. Images of transsexualism routinely
come from stories of "transition". That's a time when
media can focus on prurient, somewhat shocking and often embarrassing
aspects of someone's gender change. The stories seem superficially
sympathetic, but often convey a sad, dreary image. Readers are
left feeling sorry for the "poor things", and "certainly
wouldn't want it to happen in their family"!</p>

<p>What doesn't come through is the miracle of release from entrapment
in a male body that the transsexual girl experiences, and the
happiness she finds as a woman later on. Folks never learn about
the tens of thousands of post-operative women living among us
who are very successful and fully accepted as regular gals. The
public simply never sees these successes.</p>

<div><p>Why is this? Because almost all these women live in stealth,
just as Lynn did, fearing what might happen if their pasts were
revealed. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of young pre-operative
transsexuals live in fear and doubt about their futures. They
are often excommunicated by their families and lose their jobs,
as had happened to Lynn, when they identify their problem and
seek medical help. </p><p>

Lynn is the first truly successful case to come out of long-term
stealth and tell her story. That story should give hope to young
transsexuals. It should help parents see possibilities for happiness for a 
transsexual daughter-to-be, especially if they were to support
their child's efforts to transform a "boy's" body
and become a woman early enough in life. It should also give employers
pause for thought before firing someone - just because of their
transsexualism. </p></div>

<p>The day will come when gender transition is no longer be seen
as a sad, somewhat shameful and tragic event, but instead as a
wonderful life-giving miracle for those so unfortunate as to have
been mis-gendered at birth. Lynn hopes to live to see that day.</p>

<p dir="auto">AI Town is a virtual town where AI characters live, chat and socialize.</p>
<p dir="auto">This project is a deployable starter kit for easily building and customizing your own version of AI town. Inspired by the research paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf" rel="nofollow"><em>Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior</em></a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The primary goal of this project, beyond just being a lot of fun to work on, is to provided a platform with a strong foundation that is meant to be extended. The back-end engine natively supports shared global state, transactions, and a journal of all events so should be suitable for everything from a simple project to play around with to a scalable, multi-player game. A secondary goal is to make a JS/TS framework available as most simulators in this space (including the original paper above) are written in Python.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Run the code</h3>
<p dir="auto">To run both the front and and back end:</p>

<p dir="auto">You can now visit <a href="http://localhost:%5BPORT_NUMBER%5D" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:[PORT_NUMBER]</a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you'd rather run the frontend in a separate terminal from Convex (which syncs
your backend functions as they're saved), you can run these two commands:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npm run dev:frontend
npm run dev:backend"><pre>npm run dev:frontend
npm run dev:backend</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">See package.json for details, but dev:backend runs <code>npx convex dev</code></p>
<p dir="auto">*Note: The simulation will pause after 5 minutes if the window is idle.
Loading the page will unpause it. If you want to run the world without the
browser, you can comment-out the heartbeat check in <code>convex/engine.ts</code></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Various commands to run / test / debug</h3>
<p dir="auto"><strong>To add a new world, seed it, and start it running</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: you can add <code>--no-push</code> to run these commands without first syncing
the functions. If you already have <code>npm run dev</code> running, this will be faster.
If you remove it, it'll push up the latest version of code before running the
command.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npx convex run init:reset"><pre>npx convex run init:reset</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>To go one iteration at a time, you can create a world with</strong></p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npx convex run --no-push init:resetFrozen

# for each iteration
npx convex run --no-push engine:tick '{&quot;worldId&quot;:&quot;<your world id>&quot;,&quot;noSchedule&quot;:true}'"><pre>npx convex run --no-push init:resetFrozen

<span><span>#</span> for each iteration</span>
npx convex run --no-push engine:tick <span><span>'</span>{"worldId":"&lt;your world id&gt;","noSchedule":true}<span>'</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>To freeze the back end, in case of too much activity</strong></p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npx convex run --no-push engine:freezeAll

# when ready to rerun (defaults to latest world)
npx convex run --no-push engine:unfreeze"><pre>npx convex run --no-push engine:freezeAll

<span><span>#</span> when ready to rerun (defaults to latest world)</span>
npx convex run --no-push engine:unfreeze</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>To clear all databases</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Many options:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Go to the dashboard <code>npx convex dashboard</code> and clear tables from there.</li>
<li>Adjust the variables in <a href="https://github.com/a16z-infra/ai-town/blob/main/convex/crons.ts"><code>crons.ts</code></a> to automatically clear
up space from old journal and memory entries.</li>
<li>Run <code>npx convex run --no-push testing:debugClearAll</code> to wipe all the tables.</li>
<li>As a fallback, if things are stuck, you can check out the <code>origin/reset-town</code>
git branch. Doing <code>npm run dev</code> from there will clear your schema, stop your
functions, and allow you to delete your tables in the dashboard.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">To delete all vectors from the Pinecone index, you can run:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npx convex run --no-push lib/pinecone:deleteAllVectors"><pre><code>npx convex run --no-push lib/pinecone:deleteAllVectors
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>NOTE</strong>: If you share this index between dev &amp; prod, or between projects,
it will wipe them all out. You generally don't need to be deleting vectors from
Pinecone, as each query is indexed on the userId, which is unique between worlds
and backend instances.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>To Snoop on messages</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Run the following in a side terminal</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npx convex run testing:listMessages --no-push --watch"><pre>npx convex run testing:listMessages --no-push --watch</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Or to watch one player's state:</p>

Remember to update <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY</code> and <code>CLERK_SECRET_KEY</code> by copying secrets from Clerk's production instance -<code>cat .env.prod | fly secrets import</code> to upload secrets. Also remember to update <code>CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT</code> and <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Customize your own simulation</h2>
<p dir="auto">NOTE: every time you change character data, you should re-run <code>npx convex run testing:debugClearAll --no-push</code> and then <code>npm run dev</code> to re-upload everything to Convex. This is because character data is sent to Convex on the initial load. However, beware that <code>npx convex run testing:debugClearAll --no-push</code> WILL wipe all of your data, including your vector store.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Create your own characters and strories: All characters and stories, as well as their spirtesheet references are stored in <a href="https://github.com/a16z-infra/ai-town/blob/main/convex/characterdata/data.ts#L4">data.ts</a>. You can start by changing character descriptions.</li>
<li>Updating spritesheets: in <code>data.ts</code>, you will see this code:</li>
</ol>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="  {
    name: 'f1',
    textureUrl: '/assets/32x32folk.png',
    spritesheetData: f1SpritesheetData,
    speed: 0.1,
  },..."><pre lang="export"><code>  {
    name: 'f1',
    textureUrl: '/assets/32x32folk.png',
    spritesheetData: f1SpritesheetData,
    speed: 0.1,
  },...
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You should find a sprite sheet for your character, and define sprite motion / assets in the corresponding file (in the above example, <code>f1SpritesheetData</code> was defined in f1.ts)</p>
<ol start="3" dir="auto">
<li>Update the background (environment): <code>convex/maps/firstmap.ts</code> is where the map gets loaded. The easiest way to export a tilemap is by using <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/" rel="nofollow">Tiled</a> -- Tiled export tilemaps as a CSV and you can convert CSV to a 2d array accepted by firstmap.ts</li>

<p>Dell's Australia arm has been slapped with a $10 million AUD (about $6.49 million) fine for "making false and misleading representations on its website about discount prices for add-on computer monitors," the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) announced today. The Australian regulator said the company sold 5,300 monitors this way.</p>
<p>As Ars Technica previously reported, the ACCC launched <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/dell-in-hot-water-for-making-shoppers-think-overpriced-monitors-were-discounted/">litigation against Dell Australia</a> in November. In June, the Australian Federal Court <a href="https://www.judgments.fedcourt.gov.au/judgments/Judgments/fca/single/2023/2023fca0588" data-uri="05854df1c1e3192c7a6baccebbf109c8">declared</a> that Dell Australia made shoppers believe monitors would be cheaper if bought as an add-on item.</p>
<p>Here's how the "misleading representations" worked. Shoppers of Dell Australia's website who were buying a computer would see an offer for a Dell display with a lower price next to a higher price with a strikethrough line. That suggested to shoppers that the price they'd pay for the monitor if they added it to their cart now would be lower than the monitor's usual cost. But it turns out the strikethrough prices weren't the typical costs. Sometimes, the lower price was actually <em>higher</em> than what Dell Australia typically charged.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Dell-jpg.jpg" data-height="874" data-width="654"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Dell-jpg-640x855.jpg" width="640" height="855" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Dell-jpg.jpg 2x"></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>"In some cases, consumers paid more for the add-on monitor advertised as 'discounted' than they would have paid if they had bought it as a stand-alone product, which is shocking," ACCC commissioner Liza Carver said in a statement in June.</p>
<p>Dell Australia's website would use savings-signaling lingo, such as: "Includes x% off," "Total Savings" plus a dollar amount, and "Get the best price for popular accessories when purchased with this product," the ACCC noted.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Dell Australia also admitted to overstating "discounts customers received" since "monitors were not sold for the strikethrough price for most of the relevant time" and that it "contravened the Australian Consumer Law," according to ACCC's announcement today.</p>
<p>These tricky methods led to shoppers spending over $2 million AUD (about $1.3 million) on Dell monitors from August 2019 to December 2021, according to the ACCC.</p>
<p>“We took this action against Dell Australia because consumers rely on accurate information about prices and discounts to make purchasing decisions," Carver said in a statement today.</p>
<p>Dell Australia was already ordered by Australia's Federal Court to provide full or partial refunds to customers. The ACCC said Dell has already started contacting customers about giving full or partial refunds.</p>
<p>A Dell spokesperson told Ars Technica today that Dell is also paying customers interest and "taking steps to improve our pricing processes to ensure this sort of error does not happen again." Dell didn't specify its exact steps, but in June, Australia's Federal Court ordered Dell Australia to hire an "independent compliance professional."</p>
<p>A Dell spokesperson also told Ars:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are pleased that this is now behind us, and our focus can return to serving our Australian customers. As we acknowledged in November 2022 when the ACCC commenced these proceedings, due to an error in Dell's pricing processes, there was incorrect information displayed on our website about the pricing and savings associated with certain monitors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, for shoppers, even if Dell makes good on its word and eliminates tactics that make typical or bad prices seem like deals, the practice is common among consumer tech vendors. I often see OEMs list products, like laptops and monitors, with discounted prices <em>before</em> they've actually been released. And online marketplaces are flooded with strikethrough prices that represent what the product might have cost <em>years</em> ago.</p>
<p>Dell Australia may promise to make it easier to spot its actual deals, but it's best to make your own price comparisons or use a price tracker like <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/" data-uri="8379f2468ee2483f463d89cdbcdc3028">PCPartPicker</a> or <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/camelizer" data-uri="6f2b6aaa9b5247ef1624625dd07701e8">The Camelizer</a> (which also comes as a handy browser plugin) and avoid buyer's remorse.</p>

<p>Late Friday, some of the world’s largest record labels, including Sony and Universal Music Group, filed a lawsuit against the Internet Archive and others for the <a href="https://great78.archive.org/">Great 78 Project</a>, a community effort for the preservation, research and discovery of 78 rpm records that are 70 to 120 years old. As a non-profit library, we take this matter seriously and are currently reviewing the lawsuit with our legal counsel.</p>

<p>Of note, the <a href="https://great78.archive.org/">Great 78 Project</a> has been in operation since 2006 to bring free public access to a largely forgotten but culturally important medium. Through the efforts of dedicated librarians, archivists and sound engineers, we have preserved hundreds of thousands of recordings that are stored on shellac resin, an obsolete and brittle medium. The resulting preserved recordings retain the scratch and pop sounds that are present in the analog artifacts; noise that modern remastering techniques remove.</p>



<p><strong>Statement from Brewster Kahle, digital librarian of the Internet Archive:</strong><br>“When people want to listen to music they go to Spotify. When people want to study sound recordings as they were originally created, they go to libraries like the Internet Archive. Both are needed. There shouldn’t be conflict here.”</p>



<p>These preservation recordings are used in teaching and research, including by university professors like Jason Luther of Rowan University, whose students use the Great 78 collection as the basis for researching and writing podcasts for use in class assignments (<a href="https://blog.archive.org/2021/06/09/university-professor-leverages-78rpm-record-collection-from-the-internet-archive-for-students/">University Professor Leverages 78rpm Record Collection From the Internet Archive for Student Podcasts</a>, June 9, 2021). While this mode of access is important, usage is tiny—on average, each recording in the collection is only accessed by one researcher per month.</p>

<p>A Montana state court <a href="https://westernlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023.08.14-Held-v.-Montana-victory-order.pdf">today sided</a> with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/montana-calls-un-climate-report-hearsay-at-landmark-youth-led-climate-trial/">young people who sued the state</a> for promoting the fossil fuel industry through its <a href="https://leg.mt.gov/bills/2023/billpdf/HB0971.pdf">energy policy</a>, which they alleged prohibits Montana from weighing greenhouse gas emissions in approving the development of new factories and power plants. This prohibition, 16 plaintiffs ages 5 to 22 successfully argued, violates their constitutional right to a "clean and healthful environment in Montana for present and future generations."</p>
<p>Experts previously predicted that a win for youths in Montana would set an important legal precedent for how courts can hold states accountable for climate inaction. The same legal organization representing Montana's young plaintiffs, Our Children's Trust, is currently pursuing similar cases in four other states, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/08/14/youths-win-montana-climate-trial/">The Washington Post reported</a>.</p>
<p>The Post described this landmark case as "the nation’s first constitutional and first youth-led climate lawsuit to go to trial."</p>
<p>To climate activists, it illustrates the power of a court hearing directly from young people describing experiences with immense loss caused by climate change. Today's order followed five days of emotional testimony from young plaintiffs describing harms caused by the state's climate inaction.</p>
<p>Montana tried to argue that adjusting its energy policy and other statutes would have “no meaningful impact or appreciable effect,” the Post reported, because climate change is a global issue. Montana Assistant Attorney General Michael Russell described the testimony as a “week-long airing of political grievances that properly belong in the Legislature, not a court of law,” according to the Post. Notably, the state did not meaningfully attempt to dispute climate science.</p>
<p>However, "undisputed testimony established" that the state "could evaluate 'greenhouse gas emissions and corresponding impacts to the climate in the state' when evaluating fossil fuel activities," judge Kathy Seeley wrote in the Montana 1st Judicial District Court <a href="https://westernlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023.08.14-Held-v.-Montana-victory-order.pdf">order</a>. The state had no compelling interest not to conduct climate analyses and consider remedies, Seeley wrote.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Experts <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/young-people-in-historic-climate-trial-rest-their-case/">told Scientific American</a> that Montana's emissions are significant given its population size, emitting in 2019 "about 32 million tons of carbon dioxide." That's "about as much as Ireland, which has a population six times larger," Scientific American reported. Young people suing alleged that Montana had "never denied a permit for a fossil fuel project," the Post reported.</p>
<p>Because of this powerful youth testimony, the court ruled that the state's energy policy's limitation on environmental impact reviews was unconstitutional.</p>
<p>"Montana's greenhouse gas emissions and climate change have been proven to be a substantial factor in causing climate impacts to Montana's environment and harm and injury to the youth plaintiffs," Seeley wrote.</p>
<p>As a result of the order, any Montana statutes prohibiting climate impact analysis and remedies are now invalid and permanently enjoined.</p>
<p>"This is a monumental decision," Phil Gregory, the plaintiffs' attorney, told the Post. Another attorney for plaintiffs and executive director of Our Children's Trust, Julia Olson, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-youth-montana-trial-c7fdc1d8759f55f60346b31c73397db0?taid=64da64ccb5e4dd0001f844bc&amp;utm_campaign=TrueAnthem&amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_source=Twitter">told AP</a> that the ruling was a "huge win for Montana, for youth, for democracy, and for our climate."</p>
<p>Montana is expected to appeal the ruling, according to Emily Flower, a spokesperson for the state's Attorney General Austin Knudsen, who called the ruling "absurd."</p>
<p>“Montanans can’t be blamed for changing the climate—even the plaintiffs’ expert witnesses agreed that our state has no impact on the global climate," Flower said. "Their same legal theory has been thrown out of federal court and courts in more than a dozen states. It should have been here as well, but they found an ideological judge who bent over backward to allow the case to move forward and earn herself a spot in their next documentary.”</p>
<p>Youth plaintiffs did not ask for any damages beyond their attorneys' fees and costs, which were awarded by the court. To young people suing, winning is seemingly just about pushing the state to embrace climate science and mitigate known harms moving forward.</p>
<p>“As fires rage in the West, fueled by fossil fuel pollution, today’s ruling in Montana is a game-changer that marks a turning point in this generation’s efforts to save the planet from the devastating effects of human-caused climate chaos,” Olson told AP.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div face="garamond, palatino, geneva">

<p>My name is Jonah Katz; I'm an associate professor of linguistics at West Virginia University. I work in a large department that includes all of the world languages and literatures at WVU in addition to its 'basic' and applied linguistics programs. On August 10, 2023, the WVU provost recommended dissolving our department and all of its academic programs and faculty lines, including the only Linguistics programs in the state of West Virginia (our MA and undergrad minor). All of the tenured and untenured faculty in the department are to be laid off, including the linguistics faculty. All of the foreign language and literature programs at the university are to be discontinued; the president of the university publicly stated that foreign-language classes will be replaced with online apps or remote classes at other universities. I'm asking linguists to help us publicize what's happened here and advocate on our behalf. We are a very small program (4 faculty in basic linguistics and 4-5 more in applied linguistics/TESOL), but punch well above our weight in both research output and external grant funding. In fact, on the same day WVU wrote to tell us our department is cancelled and we are fired, they ran a front-page <a href="https://wvutoday.wvu.edu/stories/2023/08/10/wvu-linguists-sound-out-how-intensity-and-duration-of-speech-shape-pronunciation-rethinking-language-learning">article</a> on the university website celebrating the NSF grant that Sergio Robles-Puente and I recently received, and lauding our innovative research and intensive student mentoring. That grant will now need to be discontinued or moved to another institution.
</p><p>The reason given for this egregious violation of ethical and professional norms is that the university faces a dire budget crisis, and the administration has no choice but to cut academic programs in order to close their structural budget deficit. But the administration's own financial data, gathered at great cost with external consultants and publicly posted <a href="https://provost.wvu.edu/files/d/bf3ef02f-e90a-4e43-a316-d295fa489067/academic-transformation-public-data-table_july-17-2023-100.pdf">here</a>, clearly indicate that the department as a whole (p. 7) has generated operating profits of more than $800,000 in each of the last three years, even without counting our grant income, which is substantial (our NSF project is just one of several large external grants that faculty in our department have been awarded in the past several years). This is not a financial decision: it is an ideological one, as our president's public comments make clear.
</p><p>The story of how the university got into such a catastrophic financial position to begin with is a long and complex one, and tangential to my message here. But for those interested, <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/why-is-west-virginia-u-making-sweeping-cuts?">this exposé</a> in the Chronicle of Higher Education (unfortunately paywalled for many readers) and this <a href="https://wvufacts.wordpress.com/">anonymous report</a> by WVU faculty demonstrate convincingly that skyrocketing administrative personnel costs and excessive debt associated with a failed growth strategy are two of the major drivers (declining enrollment, COVID, and inadequate state funding also played a role).
</p><p>To be honest, I don't know if anything that we can do will help the situation. The leadership of the university has made up its mind, they have the backing of state politicians and the board they appointed to oversee the university, and they will not be swayed by appeals to reason or ideals. What they may respond to is public pressure, and to that end I am asking my colleagues to share what is happening here as widely as you can through all available media and professional networks. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and we need a whole lot of disinfectant at my institution. You could also consider writing to the people who made these decisions and their enablers, and if you represent an organization like a department or institute, consider doing so publicly in an open letter. Let them know what you think of the decision to eliminate all foreign language, literature, and linguistics classes at a public land-grant state flagship, and to fire all faculty regardless of merit, longevity, or tenure. Let them know how this will affect the reputation of West Virginia University and the state that it represents. Let them know how it will affect young people's prospects and their choices in one of the poorest and least-educated states in the country, where huge numbers of our most talented and driven young people are already leaving to seek better educational and professional opportunities. Thank you for your time, and to my many wonderful colleagues who have reached out this week to ask how you can help. I am lucky beyond belief to work in such a supportive, principled, and collaborative field, and to have so many amazing mentors and colleagues. Linguists really are the best. 

</p></span></div><p><span face="garamond, palatino, geneva">University leadership directly in charge of this process include President Gordon Gee ( Gordon.Gee@mail.wvu.edu ) and Provost Maryanne Reed ( Maryanne.Reed@mail.wvu.edu ). The WVU Board of Governors is a politically appointed body that is supposed to oversee the administration of the university, and will eventually need to approve the provost's recommendations. They can be contacted via Special Assistant Valerie Lopez ( Valerie.Lopez@mail.wvu.edu ). Governor Jim Justice appointed most of the Board and has strongly supported Gee during his term.

"A lot of people who are disabled or have neurodivergence or mental health concerns or caring for somebody that they love, it just makes it a lot more possible to do your best work when you have the flexibility to work from your home or go into an office in your city a few times a week or month."</p><p>Rosenthal told Insider that as of Monday, Grindr has given employees an opportunity to send in questions about the company's new policy but still has not addressed union organizers.</p><p>Grindr CEO George Arison told staff that the decision was "many months" in the making, per a memo <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/grindr-uses-return-to-work-order-to-thwart-union-complaint-says" data-analytics-product-module="body_link"><u>obtained by Bloomberg.</u></a></p><p>In a statement to Insider, a company spokesperson said the company began "the process of transitioning away from 'remote-first' to hybrid" in April and that employees were informed of a future switch to hybrid work during an all-hands meeting in June — before the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://time.com/6296516/grindr-union-tech-layoffs-lgbt/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link"><u>unionization effort was announced</u></a>.</p><p>However, employees told <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/12/business/grindr-rto-union.html" data-analytics-product-module="body_link"><u>The New York Times</u></a> that the company told them to expect the transition after one or two quarters. Rosenthal told Insider that they were not at the all-hands meeting but said many employees expected that remote workers would be allowed to stay remote based on company communications.</p><p>"We were told that we were going to hire new workers in these specific cities, but specifically that this was not going to affect existing employees," Rosenthal said.</p><p>The company spokesperson also said that the decision to move to a hybrid-work model has "nothing to do with the NLRB election petition" and said, "We respect and support our team members' rights to make their own decision about union representation."</p><p>Grindr is just one of the latest companies to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wfh-work-from-home-decreases-productivity-18-percent-study-rto-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link"><u>urge employees to return to the office</u></a>. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-senior-leader-office-remote-work-grow-faster-better-job-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link"><u>Amazon</u></a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-threatens-staff-not-coming-office-three-days-week-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link"><u>Apple</u></a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-starbucks-forcing-employees-back-office-your-company-unlikely-next-2023-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link"><u>Disney</u></a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-microsoft-ibm-companies-hybrid-work-office-collaboration-flexibility-happiness-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link"><u>Google</u></a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-rehiring-workers-from-layoffs-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link"><u>Meta</u></a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-emailed-twitter-staff-office-is-not-optional-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link"><u>X</u></a> (formerly <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/x-could-be-a-positive-move-for-musk-twitter-2023-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link"><u>Twitter</u></a>), and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-making-workers-employees-return-to-office-rto-wfh-hybrid-2023-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link"><u>dozens of other </u></a>businesses are asking their white-collar employees to work in the office at least part of the time.</p><p>That model is unpopular <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/i-do-not-miss-office-life-2023-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link"><u>among many workers</u></a>, who say they would <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-remote-workers-would-take-pay-cut-to-keep-wfh-2023-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link"><u>take a pay cut over an in-person job.</u></a> According to a recent <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/need-to-hire-workers-in-a-hot-job-market-let-them-do-some-remote-work-506f72e6?mod=hp_lead_pos8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link"><u>Wall Street Journal</u></a> report, employers forcing a return to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/employees-work-from-home-benefits-as-good-as-raise-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link"><u>in-person work</u></a> are seeing slower hiring rates.</p><p>Quinn McGee, an employee organizer at Grindr United CWA, told Vice the demands sent by Grindr — which McGee said has refused to meet with employees about the union drive — were "dehumanizing."</p><p>"To tell me that I have two weeks to decide whether or not to uproot my family's life for a job that won't come to the table and speak with me as an adult — it's dehumanizing," McGee told the publication.</p><p>Rosenthal, who lives in New York, told Insider that they are being asked to move to Los Angeles as a member of the design team.

ChatGPT makes us very productive. Personally, in my early 40s, I feel my brain is back in 20s.</p><p>2. I no longer feel the need to hire juniors. This is a short-term positive and maybe a long-term negative.
[[EDIT: I may have implied a wrong meaning. To clarify - nobody's going yet because of ChatGPT. It is just raising the bar high and higher. What took me years to learn, this thing can do already and much more. And I cannot predict the financial future of OpenAI or the markets in general.]]</p><p>A lot of stuff I used to delegate to fellow humans are now being delegated to ChatGPT. And I can get the results immediately and at any time I want. I agree that it cannot operate on its own. I still need to review and correct things. I have do that even when working with other humans. The only difference is that I can start trusting a human to improve, but I cannot expect ChatGPT to do so. Not that it is incapable, but because it is restricted by OpenAI.</p><p>And I have gotten better at using it. Calling myself a prompt-engineer sounds weird.</p><p>With all the good, I am now experiencing the cons, stress and burnout:</p><p>1. Humans work 9-5 (or some schedule), but ChatGPT is available always and works instantly. Now, when I have some idea I want to try out - I start working on it immediately with the help of AI. Earlier I just used to put a note in the todo-list and stash it for the next day.</p><p>2. The outputs with ChatGPT are so fast, that my "review load" is too high. At times it feels like we are working for ChatGPT and not the other way around.</p><p>3. ChatGPT has the habit of throwing new knowledge back at you. Google does that too, but this feels 10x of Google. Sometimes it is overwhelming. Good thing is we learn a lot, bad thing is that if often slows down our decision making.</p><p>4. I tried to put a schedule to use it - but when everybody has access to this tech, I have a genuine fear of missing out.</p><p>5. I have zero doubt that AI is setting the bar high, and it is going to take away a ton of average-joe desk jobs. GPT-4 itself is quite capable and organisations are yet to embrace it.</p><p>And not the least, it makes me worry - what lies with the future models. I am not a layman when it comes to AI/ML - have worked with it until the past few years in the pre-GPT era.</p><p>Has anybody experienced these issues? And how do you deal with those?</p><p>* I could not resist asking ChatGPT the above - couple of strategies it told me were to "Seek Support from Others" and "Participating in discussions or groups focused on ethical AI". *</p></div></td></tr>        <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span><span><span>Losing the ability to see clearly, and losing the ability to think or remember clearly, are two of the most dreaded, and preventable, health issues associated with getting older. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Now, a new study lends further weight to the idea that vision problems and dementia are linked.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>In a sample of nearly 3,000 older adults who took vision tests and cognitive tests during home visits, the </span></span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2023.2854?guestAccessKey=35220a9e-e304-4ca1-a14e-c221ea092c34&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=071323"><span><span>risk of dementia was much higher among those with eyesight problems</span></span></a><span><span> – including those who weren’t able to see well even when they were wearing their usual eyeglasses or contact lenses. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The research was published recently in <em>JAMA Ophthalmology</em> by a team from the </span></span><a href="https://www.umkelloggeye.org/"><span><span>Kellogg Eye Center at Michigan Medicine</span></span></a><span><span>, the University of Michigan’s academic medical center. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Based on data from a nationally representative study of older adults conducted in 2021 through the </span></span><a href="https://isr.umich.edu/"><span><span>U-M Institute for Social Research</span></span></a><span><span>, it adds to a growing pile of studies that have suggested a link between vision and dementia. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><em><span><span><a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/many-older-adults-lack-clear-eyesight-even-glasses#:~:text=New%20research%20shows%20that%2028,lenses%2C%20or%20other%20visual%20aids.">SEE ALSO: Many older adults lack clear eyesight, even with glasses</a></span></span></em></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>All of the older adults in the study were over the age of 71, with an average age of 77. They had their up-close and distance vision, and their ability to see letters that didn’t contrast strongly with their background, tested by a visiting team member using a digital tablet. They also took tests of memory and thinking ability, and provided health information including any existing diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease or another form of dementia.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Just over 12% of the whole group had dementia. But that percentage was higher – nearly 22% -- among those who had impaired vision for seeing up close.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>In addition, one-third (33%) of those with moderate or severe distance vision impairment, including those who were blind, had signs of dementia. So did 26% of those who had trouble seeing letters that didn’t contrast strongly against a background</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Even among those with a mild distance vision issue, 19% had dementia.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>After the researchers adjusted for other differences in health status and personal characteristics, people with moderate to severe distance vision issues were 72% more likely than those with no vision issues to have dementia. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The gaps were smaller, but still large, for other types of vision impairment&nbsp;</span></span></span>– <span><span><span> except mild problems with distance vision, where there was no statistical difference.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Those who had more than one kind of vision impairment were also 35% more likely to have dementia than those with normal vision.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The study b</span></span></span><span><span>uilds on previous studies that had similar findings but relied on self-reported vision abilities rather than objective testing, or that were not representative of the United States population. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><em><span><span><a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/vision-impairment-associated-mortality">SEE ALSO: Vision Impairment is Associated with Mortality</a></span></span></em></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>It also builds on previous work about cataract surgery that showed lower rates of dementia over time in adults who had had their distance vision restored by having surgery. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The authors, led by ophthalmologists Olivia Killeen, M.D., M.S. and Joshua Ehrlich, M.D., M.P.H., write, “</span></span><span><span><span>Prioritizing vision health may be key to optimizing both sight and overall health and well-being.</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Randomized trials are warranted to determine whether optimizing vision is a viable strategy to slow cognitive decline and reduce dementia risk.”</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>But in the meantime, in an </span></span><a href="https://jamanetwork-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2023.3008"><span><span>accompanying editorial</span></span></a><span><span>, Sheila West, Ph.D., of the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins Medicine, wrote that the new study adds to accumulating evidence about the link between vision and cognitive issues. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“Equitable access to vision care services that prevent, reverse, or at least stave off progression of loss of sight is a worthy goal regardless of the potential impact on dementia and may be especially critical for those experiencing cognitive decline,” she wrote.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The study is based on data from </span></span><a href="https://www.nhats.org/"><span><span>the National Health and Aging Trends Study</span></span></a><span><span>, which is based at the U-M Institute for Social Research and the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><em><span><span><a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/early-signs-alzheimers-most-older-adults-see-value-screening-havent-been-tested">SEE ALSO: Early signs of Alzheimer’s: Most older adults see the value of screening but haven’t been tested</a></span></span></em></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Last year, Ehrlich and colleagues </span></span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2791268"><span><span>published a paper in JAMA Neurology</span></span></a><span><span> that used another ISR-based survey of older adults – the Health and Retirement Study – to estimate the percentage of Americans with dementia whose condition is likely related to their vision loss. They calculated that 1.8 percent of all cases are vision-related, equating to more than 100,000 of the 6 million Americans with dementia. This study suggested that vision impairment should be considered alongside other more commonly recognized modifiable dementia risk factors. That study was funded by the </span></span><span><span>U-M Center to Accelerate Population Research in Alzheimer's through funding from the National Institute on Aging. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Killeen recently completed the </span></span><a href="https://ihpi.umich.edu/education-training/NCSP"><span><span>National Clinician Scholars Program</span></span></a><span><span> at the U-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation and is now at Duke University. Ehrlich is an assistant professor of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at Michigan Medicine and a research assistant professor at ISR, where he is a co-investigator of NHATS, as well as a member of IHPI.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The study’s authors also include Yunshu Zhou, M.S.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>In addition to the National Institute on Aging grant that supports NHATS, and the U-M funding that supports the National Clinician Scholars Program, the study was funded by an unrestricted grant to the U-M Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences by Research to Prevent Blindness</span></span></span></span></p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Outlines</strong> 〰 is a library for neural text generation. You can think of it as a
more flexible replacement for the <code>generate</code> method in the
<a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers">transformers</a> library.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Outlines</strong> 〰 helps developers <em>guide text generation</em> to build robust
interfaces with external systems. Provides generation methods that
guarantee that the output will match a regular expressions, or follow
a JSON schema.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Outlines</strong> 〰 provides <em>robust prompting primitives</em> that separate the prompting
from the execution logic and lead to simple implementations of few-shot
generations, ReAct, meta-prompting, agents, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Outlines</strong> 〰 is designed as a <em>library</em> that is meant to be compatible the
broader ecosystem, not to replace it. We use as few abstractions as possible,
and generation can be interleaved with control flow, conditionals, custom Python
functions and calls to other libraries.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Outlines</strong> 〰 is <em>compatible with all models</em>. It only interfaces with models
via the next-token logits. It can be used with API-based models as well.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Outlines</strong> is available on PyPi:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Guided generation</h2>
<p dir="auto">The first step towards reliability of systems that include large language models
is to ensure that there is a well-defined interface between their output and
user-defined code. <strong>Outlines</strong> provides ways to control the generation of
language models to make their output more predictable.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Early stopping</h3>
<p dir="auto">You can stop the generation after a given sequence has been found:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="import outlines.text.generate as generate

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Prompting</h2>
<p dir="auto">Writing prompts by concatenating strings in pure Python quickly becomes
cumbersome: the prompt building logic gets entangled with the rest of the
program, and the structure of the rendered prompt is obfuscated.<strong>Outlines</strong>
makes it easier to write and manage prompts by encapsulating templates inside
"template functions".</p>
<p dir="auto">These functions make it possible to neatly separate the prompt logic from the
general program logic; they can be imported from other modules and libraries.</p>
<p dir="auto">Template functions require no superfluous abstraction, they use the Jinja2
templating engine to help build complex prompts in a concise manner:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Description</h2>
<p dir="auto">Trafilatura is a <strong>Python package and command-line tool</strong> designed to gather text on the Web. It includes discovery, extraction and text processing components. Its main applications are <strong>web crawling, downloads, scraping, and extraction</strong> of main texts, metadata and comments. It aims at staying <strong>handy and modular</strong>: no database is required, the output can be converted to various commonly used formats.</p>
<p dir="auto">Going from raw HTML to essential parts can alleviate many problems related to text quality, first by avoiding the <strong>noise caused by recurring elements</strong> (headers, footers, links/blogroll etc.) and second by including information such as author and date in order to <strong>make sense of the data</strong>. The extractor tries to strike a balance between limiting noise (precision) and including all valid parts (recall). It also has to be <strong>robust and reasonably fast</strong>, it runs in production on millions of documents.</p>
<p dir="auto">This tool can be <strong>useful for quantitative research</strong> in corpus linguistics, natural language processing, computational social science and beyond: it is relevant to anyone interested in data science, information extraction, text mining, and scraping-intensive use cases like search engine optimization, business analytics or information security.</p>

<p><em>Note: I've gone ahead and updated the featured image, so it doesn't seem like this has something to do with Discord "directly". It was not my intention to leave an impression like that, but this still affects every single Discord user who was using the Discord.io service!</em></p>



<p>An unidentified individual has listed the data of 760,000 <a href="https://discord.io/servers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord.io</a> (the site is dead at the moment, so you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220329132537/https://discord.io/servers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">see an Archive.org snapshot here</a>) users for sale on a darknet forum. This discovery was brought to light by <a href="https://t.me/dataleak/3057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the "Information Leaks" Telegram channel</a>, associated with the Russian service for tracking vulnerabilities, data leaks, and monitoring fraudulent online resources.</p>



<p>For clarity, Discord.io is/was a platform that allows you to create custom, personal Discord invites.&nbsp;The offered database comprises details like email addresses, hashed passwords, and other user-specific data.</p>



<p>UPDATE: Discord.io team has now confirmed that the breach is real; an update is added at the bottom of the article!</p>



<p>To vouch for the authenticity of the data, the seller presented a sample which was then reviewed by cybersecurity experts. Their evaluation confirmed that the sample logins are genuine, matching real Discord users. And just to make it clear - genuine, as in the corresponding email addresses from the leak, were verified to be associated with real Discord accounts through several password recovery tests.</p>



<p>The implication here is that malevolent parties can exploit this data for phishing schemes, spamming, or other deceptive undertakings.</p>

<p><strong>This does look to be real, though. I tried reaching out to the Discord.io team <a href="https://discord.com/invite/fa2mdsZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on their Discord server</a>, and two minutes after joining, every single channel got manually deleted.</strong></p>

<p>As of now, Discord itself has not provided an official response to the situation. </p>



<p>However, for users of the platform, the advisable course of action is to promptly change passwords and activate two-factor authentication on their accounts to bolster security.</p>



<p><em>Note: We have reached out to Discord for comments and are awaiting their response.</em></p>



<h3>Discord.io team confirms the breach is real; here's what you need to know</h3>



<p>The team behind Discord.io has officially confirmed the data breach. In a detailed statement on Discord, they provided <a href="https://discord.com/channels/232335047170981890/1140679839347646614/1140685631471755389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a comprehensive account of the events</a> that led to the breach, what data was compromised, and the subsequent actions they've taken.</p>



<p><em>Timeline of Events:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Monday, August 14, 2023, 12:51 AM CET</strong>: A preview of the Discord.io user database appears on BreachForums.</li>



<li><strong>Monday, August 14, 2023, 4:30 PM CET</strong>: Discord.io team becomes aware of the breach.</li>



<li><strong>Monday, August 14, 2023, 4:36 PM CET</strong>: The breach's legitimacy is confirmed.</li>



<li><strong>Monday, August 14, 2023, 4:40 PM CET</strong>: All Discord.io services commence shutdown.</li>
</ul>



<p><em>Data Compromised in the Breach:</em></p>



<p><strong>Non-Sensitive Information:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Internal user ID</li>



<li>Avatar details</li>



<li>User status (e.g., moderator, admin, has ads, banned, public)</li>



<li>Coin balance and current streak in the free minigame</li>



<li>API key (relevant for a limited number of users)</li>



<li>Registration and last payment dates, including premium membership expiration</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Potentially Sensitive Information:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Usernames, either from signup or the current Discord username</li>



<li>Discord ID</li>



<li>Email address associated with the account</li>



<li>Billing address (pertaining to a select few users who provided this before the adoption of Stripe for payments)</li>



<li>Salted and hashed passwords (mainly concerning users prior to 2018 when Discord.io began exclusively using Discord for logins)</li>
</ul>



<p><em>Data That Remained Secure:</em></p>



<ul>
<li>Anything not explicitly mentioned in the compromised list.</li>



<li>Payment details, which are securely stored with partners Stripe and PayPal.</li>
</ul>



<p><em>Further Actions &amp; Notes:</em></p>



<ul>
<li>All existing premium subscriptions have been canceled, with the team set to contact subscribers individually.</li>



<li>As of their last update, the Discord.io team hasn't established contact with the culprits nor discerned if the database has been shared with the public.</li>



<li>A list of servers that once used Discord.io's service has been made available, though it might contain outdated or inactive links.</li>



<li>Users wishing to get in touch are encouraged to send a helpdesk request, with "Support" for general queries and "Admin" for sensitive matters. Given the gravity of the situation, the team cautions that they might not be able to address every message but appreciate user patience and understanding.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>No computer algebra system implements a complete decision process for the integration of mixed transcendental and algebraic functions.</p>
<p>The integral from the excellent paper of Schultz may be solved by Maple if you convert the integrand to RootOf notation (Why this is not done internally in Maple is an interesting question?)</p>
<pre><code>int(convert((29*x^2+18*x-3)/(x^6+4*x^5+6*x^4-12*x^3+33*x^2-16*x)^(1/2),RootOf),x);
</code></pre>
<p>My experiments suggest Maple has the best implementation of the Risch-Trager-Bronstein algorithm for the integration of purely algebraic integrals in terms of elementary functions (ref: table 1, section 3 of Sam Blake, <em>A Simple Method for Computing Some Pseudo-Elliptic Integrals in Terms of Elementary Functions</em>, arXiv:<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04910" rel="noreferrer">2004.04910</a>). However, Maple's implementation does not integrate expressions containing parameters or nested radicals (both of which has some support in AXIOM and FriCAS).</p>
<p>It would seem that some significant progress has been made in computing the logarithmic part of a mixed transcendental-algebraic integral by Miller [1]. Though, as far as I know, no computer algebra system has implemented his algorithm. It is also not clear if Miller's algorithm can deal with parameters, for example, the Risch-Trager-Bronstein algorithm has difficulties with the following pseudo-elliptic integral</p>
<p><span>$$\int\frac{\left(p x^2-q\right) \left(p x^2-x+q\right)dx}{x \left(p x^2+2 x+q\right) \sqrt{2 p^2x^4+2 p x^3+(4 p q+1) x^2+2 q x+2 q^2}} = - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\log (x) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\log \left(\sqrt{2} y +2 p x^2+x+2q\right) - \frac{3}{\sqrt{5}}\tanh ^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{5} y}{3 p x^2+3 q+x}\right),$$</span>
where <span>$y=\sqrt{2 p^2 x^4+2 p x^3+(4 pq+1)x^2+2 q x+2 q^2}$</span>. My heuristic in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04910.pdf" rel="noreferrer">previously-linked paper</a> computes this integral quickly with the substitution <span>$u=\frac{px^2+q}{p x}$</span>.</p>
<p>In regards to the mixed algebraic-transcendental case of the Risch-Trager-Bronstein algorithm, an integral which cannot be solved with Maple, Mathematica, AXIOM or FriCAS (and possibly other CAS) is</p>
<p><span>$$\int \frac{\left(\sqrt{x}+1\right) \left(e^{2x \sqrt{x}} -a\right) \sqrt{a^2+2 a x e^{2 \sqrt{x}} +cx e^{2 \sqrt{x}} +x^2 e^{4 \sqrt{x}}}}{x \sqrt{x}e^{\sqrt{x}} \left(a+x e^{2 \sqrt{x}} \right)} dx.$$</span></p>
<p>This integral is interesting as it returns two distinct messages from AXIOM and FriCAS suggesting their respective implementations are incomplete. FriCAS returns</p>
<pre><code>(1) -&gt; integrate(((-a+exp(2*x^(1/2))*x)*x^(-3/2)*(1+x^(1/2))*(a^2+2*a*exp(2*x^(1/2))*x+c*exp(2*x^(1/2))*x+exp(4*x^(1/2))*x^2)^(1/2))/(exp(x^(1/2))*(a+exp(2*x^(1/2))*x)),x)

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Years before she was even sure the <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-nasas-james-webb-space-telescope-matters-so-much-20211203/">James Webb Space Telescope</a> would successfully launch, <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~eilers/">Christina Eilers</a> started planning a conference for astronomers specializing in the early universe. She knew that if — preferably, when — JWST started making observations, she and her colleagues would have a lot to talk about. Like a time machine, the telescope could see farther away and farther into the past than any previous instrument.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Eilers (and the rest of the astronomical community), her planning was not for naught: JWST launched and deployed without a hitch, then started scrutinizing the early universe in earnest from its perch in space a million miles away.</p>
<p>In mid-June, about 150 astronomers gathered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for Eilers’ JWST “First Light” conference. Not quite a year had passed since JWST <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/two-weeks-in-the-webb-space-telescope-is-reshaping-astronomy-20220725/">started sending images</a> back to Earth. And just as Eilers had anticipated, the telescope was already reshaping astronomers’ understanding of the cosmos’s first billion years.</p>

<p>One set of enigmatic objects stood out in the myriad presentations. Some astronomers called them “hidden little monsters.” To others, they were “little red dots.” But whatever their name, the data was clear: When JWST stares at young galaxies — which appear as mere red specks in the darkness — it sees a surprising number with cyclones churning in their centers.</p>
<p>“There seems to be an abundant population of sources we didn’t know about,” said Eilers, an astronomer at MIT, “which we didn’t anticipate finding at all.”</p>
<p>In recent months, a torrent of observations of the cosmic smudges has delighted and confounded astronomers.</p>
<p>“Everybody is talking about these little red dots,” said <a href="https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/xiaohui-fan">Xiaohui Fan</a>, a researcher at the University of Arizona who has spent his career searching for distant objects in the early universe.</p>
<p>The most straightforward explanation for the tornado-hearted galaxies is that large black holes weighing millions of suns are whipping the gas clouds into a frenzy. That finding is both expected and perplexing. It is expected because JWST was built, in part, to find the ancient objects. They are the ancestors of billion-sun behemoth black holes that seem to appear in the cosmic record inexplicably early. By studying these precursor black holes, such as three record-setting youngsters discovered this year, scientists hope to learn where the first humongous black holes came from and perhaps identify which of two competing theories better describes their formation: Did they grow extremely rapidly, or were they simply born big? Yet the observations are also perplexing because few astronomers expected JWST to find so many young, hungry black holes — and surveys are turning them up by the dozen. In the process of attempting to solve the former mystery, astronomers have uncovered a throng of bulky black holes that may rewrite established theories of stars, galaxies and more.</p>
<p>“As a theorist, I have to build a universe,” said <a href="http://www2.iap.fr/users/volonter/">Marta Volonteri</a>, an astrophysicist specializing in black holes at the Paris Institute of Astrophysics. Volonteri and her colleagues are now contending with the influx of giant black holes in the early cosmos. “If they are [real], they completely change the picture.”</p>
<h2><strong>A Cosmic Time Machine </strong></h2>
<p>The JWST observations are shaking up astronomy in part because the telescope can detect light reaching Earth from deeper in space than any earlier machine.</p>

<p>“We built this absurdly powerful telescope over 20 years,” said <a href="https://www.granttremblay.com/">Grant Tremblay</a>, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. “The whole point of it originally was to look deep into cosmic time.”</p>
<p>One of the mission’s goals is to catch galaxies in the act of forming during the universe’s first billion years (out of its roughly 13.8-billion-year history). The telescope’s initial observations from last summer <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/standard-model-of-cosmology-survives-jwsts-surprising-finds-20230120/">hinted at a young universe</a> full of strikingly mature galaxies, but the information astronomers could wring from such images was limited. To really understand the early universe, astronomers needed more than just the images; they hungered for the spectra of those galaxies — the data that comes in when the telescope breaks incoming light into specific hues.</p>
<p>Galactic spectra, which JWST started to send back in earnest at the end of last year, are useful for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, they let astronomers nail down the galaxy’s age. The infrared light JWST collects is reddened, or redshifted, meaning that as it traverses the cosmos, its wavelengths are stretched by the expansion of space. The extent of that redshift lets astronomers determine a galaxy’s distance, and therefore when it originally emitted its light. Nearby galaxies have a redshift of almost zero. JWST can handily make out objects beyond a redshift of 5, which corresponds to roughly 1 billion years after the Big Bang. Objects at higher redshifts are significantly older and farther away.</p>

<p>Second, spectra give astronomers a sense of what’s happening in a galaxy. Each hue marks an interaction between photons and specific atoms (or molecules). One color originates from a hydrogen atom flashing as it settles down after a bump; another indicates jostled oxygen atoms, and another nitrogen. A spectrum is a pattern of colors that reveals what a galaxy is made of and what those elements are doing, and JWST is providing that crucial context for galaxies at unprecedented distances.</p>
<p>“We’ve made such a huge leap,” said <a href="https://users.ox.ac.uk/~phys2391/">Aayush Saxena</a>, an astronomer at the University of Oxford. The fact that “we’re talking about chemical composition of redshift 9 galaxies is just absolutely remarkable.”</p>
<p>(Redshift 9 is mind-bogglingly distant, corresponding to a time when the universe was a mere 0.55 billion years old.)</p>
<p>Galactic spectra are also perfect tools for finding a major perturber of atoms: giant black holes that lurk at the hearts of galaxies. Black holes themselves are dark, but when they feed on gas and dust, they rip atoms apart, making them beam out telltale colors. Long before JWST’s launch, astrophysicists hoped the telescope would help them spot those patterns and find enough of the early universe’s biggest and most active black holes to solve the mystery of how they formed.</p>
<h2><strong>Too Big, Too Early</strong></h2>
<p>The mystery began more than 20 years ago, when a team led by Fan spotted one of <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/300944">the most distant galaxies</a> ever observed — a brilliant quasar, or a galaxy anchored to an active supermassive black hole weighing perhaps billions of suns. It had a redshift of 5, corresponding to around 1.1 billion years after the Big Bang. With further sweeps of the sky, Fan and his colleagues repeatedly broke their own records, pushing the quasar redshift frontier to <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/324111">6 in 2001</a> and eventually to <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abd8c6/meta">7.6 in 2021</a> ­­— just 0.7 billion years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>The problem was that making such gigantic black holes seemed impossible so early in cosmic history.</p>
<p>Like any object, black holes take time to grow and form. And like a 6-foot-tall toddler, Fan’s supersize black holes were too big for their age — the universe wasn’t old enough for them to have accrued billions of suns of heft. To explain those overgrown toddlers, physicists were forced to consider two distasteful options.</p>

<p>The first was that Fan’s galaxies started off filled with standard, roughly stellar-mass black holes of the sort supernovas often leave behind. Those then grew both by merging and by swallowing up surrounding gas and dust. Normally, if a black hole feasts aggressively enough, an outpouring of radiation pushes away its morsels. That stops the feeding frenzy and sets a speed limit for black hole growth that scientists call the Eddington limit. But it’s a soft ceiling: A constant torrent of dust could conceivably overcome the outpouring of radiation. However, it’s hard to imagine sustaining such “super-Eddington” growth for long enough to explain Fan’s beasts — they would have had to bulk up unthinkably fast.</p>
<p>Or perhaps black holes can be born improbably large. Gas clouds in the early universe may have collapsed directly into black holes weighing many thousands of suns — producing objects called heavy seeds. This scenario is hard to stomach too, because such large, lumpy gas clouds should fracture into stars before forming a black hole.</p>
<p>One of JWST’s priorities is to evaluate these two scenarios by peering into the past and catching the fainter ancestors of Fan’s galaxies. These precursors wouldn’t quite be quasars, but galaxies with somewhat smaller black holes on their way to becoming quasars. With JWST, scientists have their best chance of spotting black holes that have barely started to grow — objects that are young enough and small enough for researchers to nail down their birth weight.</p>
<p>That’s one reason a group of astronomers with the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey, or CEERS, led by Dale Kocevski of Colby College, started working overtime when they first noticed signs of such young black holes popping up in the days following Christmas.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of impressive how many of these there are,” wrote <a href="https://www.rit.edu/directory/jsksps-jeyhan-kartaltepe">Jeyhan Kartaltepe</a>, an astronomer at the Rochester Institute of Technology, during a discussion on Slack.</p>
<p>“Lots of little hidden monsters,” Kocevski replied.</p>

<h2><strong>A Growing Crowd of Monsters </strong></h2>
<p>In the CEERS spectra, a few galaxies immediately leapt out as potentially hiding baby black holes — the little monsters. Unlike their more vanilla siblings, these galaxies emitted light that didn’t arrive with just one crisp shade for hydrogen. Instead, the hydrogen line was smeared, or broadened, into a range of hues, indicating that some light waves were squished as orbiting gas clouds accelerated toward JWST (just as an approaching ambulance emits a rising wail as its siren’s soundwaves are compressed) while other waves were stretched as clouds flew away. Kocevski and his colleagues knew that black holes were just about the only object capable of slinging hydrogen around like that.</p>

<p>“The only way to see the broad component of the gas orbiting the black hole is if you’re looking right down the barrel of the galaxy and right into the black hole,” Kocevski said.</p>
<p>By the end of January, the CEERS team had managed to crank out a preprint describing two of the “hidden little monsters,” as they called them. Then the group set out to systematically study a wider swath of the hundreds of galaxies collected by their program to see just how many black holes were out there. But they got scooped by another team, led by Yuichi Harikane of the University of Tokyo, just weeks later. Harikane’s group searched 185 of the most distant CEERS galaxies and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11946">found 10</a> with broad hydrogen lines — the likely work of million-solar-mass central black holes at redshifts between 4 and 7. Then in June, an analysis of two other surveys led by <a href="https://people.phys.ethz.ch/~mattheej/Welcome.html">Jorryt Matthee</a> of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich identified 20 more “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05448">little red dots</a>” with broad hydrogen lines: black holes churning around redshift 5. An analysis <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01230">posted in early August</a> announced another dozen, a few of which may even be in the process of growing by merging.</p>
<p>“I’ve been waiting for these things for so long,” Volonteri said. “It’s been incredible.”</p>
<p>But few astronomers anticipated the sheer number of galaxies with a big, active black hole. The baby quasars in JWST’s first year of observations are more numerous than scientists had predicted based on the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abbe11/meta">census of adult quasars</a> — between 10 times and 100 times more abundant.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Zoom says it will walk back a recent change to its terms of service that allowed the company to use some customer content to train its machine learning and artificial intelligence models.</p><p>The move comes after recent criticism on social media from customers who are concerned about the privacy implications of Zoom using data in such a manner.</p><h2>Backing Down on Data Use Plans</h2><p>"Following feedback, Zoom made the decision to <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/en/terms/" target="_blank">update its Terms of Service</a> to reflect Zoom does not use any of your audio, video, chat, screen sharing, attachments or other communications-like Customer Content (such as poll results, whiteboard and reactions) to train Zoom or third-party artificial intelligence models," a spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. "Zoom has accordingly updated its Terms of Service and product to make this policy clear."</p><p>Zoom's decision — and the reason for it — is sure to add to the growing debate about the privacy and security implications of technology companies using customer data to train AI models.</p><p>In Zoom's case, the company recently introduced two generative AI features — Zoom IQ Meeting Summary and Zoom IQ Team Chat Compose — that offer AI-powered chat composition and automated meeting summaries. The terms of an updated service policy that the company announced earlier this year gave Zoom the right to use some customer data behind these services <span>for training the AI models </span>— without needing customer consent.</p><p>Specifically, Zoom's policy gave the company a "perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable" right to use customer data for a wide range of purposes including machine learning, artificial intelligence, training, and testing. It also allowed Zoom the unbridled right to do virtually anything with the data including to "redistribute, publish, import, access, use, store, transmit, disclose" the data.</p><p>After customers <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7094259387493453825/" target="_blank">pushed back on social media</a> Zoom initially revised its policy earlier this month to give customers the right to opt out of having their data used for AI training. "Zoom will not use audio, video or chat Customer Content to train our artificial intelligence models without your consent," the company said.</p><h2>Delicate Balance</h2><p>On August 11, the company again revised its terms of service, this time to scrub virtually all references to the use of artificial intelligence. The newly revised policy still gives Zoom all "rights, title, and interest" to a lot of service generated data including telemetry data, product usage data, and diagnostic data. But the company will not user customer content to train AI models.</p><p>Zoom's experience highlights the delicate balance tech companies must strike between innovation and user trust when integrating AI into their products and services. Numerous technology companies have been using customer data for years to improve user experiences and introduce new features and functions, says Shomron Jacob, head of machine learning at iterate.ai. "Data is often called the "new oil" in the digital age because of its invaluable role in training and refining AI models to improve user experiences, functionalities, and new features," Jacob says. "Companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have long used user data to tailor their services and improve their AI algorithms."</p><p>However, given the increasing scrutiny of the privacy, security, and ethical implications surrounding AI, there's a rising expectation for transparency and user consent, he says. While companies will likely continue to use customer data like they have been, there is going to be increased pressure on them to provide clear user opt-outs, to anonymize data and to ensure that personal and sensitive information remain protected.</p><p>"Moreover, regulatory frameworks like [the] GDPR in Europe and CCPA in California set data collection and usage standards," Jacob says. "As these regulations become more stringent and widespread, tech companies must navigate the dual challenges of leveraging user data for AI improvements while ensuring strict compliance and safeguarding user trust."</p></div></div>]]></description>

    <h2><a href="https://go.dev/blog/">The Go Blog</a></h2>
    

    
      
      
      
      <p>Go 1.21 includes new features to improve compatibility.
Before you stop reading, I know that sounds boring.
But boring can be good.
Back in the early days of Go 1,
Go was exciting and full of surprises.
Each week we cut a new snapshot release
and everyone got to roll the dice
to see what we’d changed
and how their programs would break.
We released Go 1 and its compatibility promise
to remove the excitement,
so that new releases of Go would be boring.</p>
<p>Boring is good.
Boring is stable.
Boring means being able to focus on your work,
not on what’s different about Go.
This post is about the important work we shipped in Go 1.21
to keep Go boring.</p>
<h2 id="go1">Go 1 Compatibility</h2>
<p>We’ve been focused on compatibility for over a decade.
For Go 1, back in 2012, we published a document titled
“<a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1compat">Go 1 and the Future of Go Programs</a>”
that lays out a very clear intention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is intended that programs written to the Go 1 specification
will continue to compile and run correctly, unchanged,
over the lifetime of that specification. …
Go programs that work today should continue to work
even as future releases of Go 1 arise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few qualifications to that.
First, compatibility means source compatibility.
When you update to a new version of Go,
you do have to recompile your code.
Second, we can add new APIs,
but not in a way that breaks existing code.</p>
<p>The end of the document warns,
“[It] is impossible to guarantee that no future change will break any program.”
Then it lays out a number of reasons why programs might still break.</p>
<p>For example, it makes sense that if your program depends on a buggy behavior
and we fix the bug, your program will break.
But we try very hard to break as little as possible and keep Go boring.
There are two main approaches we’ve used so far: API checking and testing.</p>
<h2 id="api">API Checking</h2>
<p>Perhaps the clearest fact about compatibility
is that we can’t take away API, or else programs using it will break.</p>
<p>For example, here’s a program someone has written
that we can’t break:</p>
<pre><code>package main

import "os"

func main() {
    os.Stdout.WriteString("hello, world\n")
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can’t remove the package <code>os</code>;
we can’t remove the global variable <code>os.Stdout</code>, which is an <code>*os.File</code>;
and we also can’t remove the <code>os.File</code> method <code>WriteString</code>.
It should be clear that removing any of those would
break this program.</p>
<p>It’s perhaps less clear that we can’t change the type of <code>os.Stdout</code> at all.
Suppose we want to make it an interface with the same methods.
The program we just saw wouldn’t break, but this one would:</p>
<pre><code>package main

import "os"

func main() {
    greet(os.Stdout)
}

func greet(f *os.File) {
    f.WriteString(“hello, world\n”)
}
</code></pre>
<p>This program passes <code>os.Stdout</code> to a function named <code>greet</code>
that requires an argument of type <code>*os.File</code>.
So changing <code>os.Stdout</code> to an interface will break this program.</p>
<p>To help us as we develop Go, we use a tool that maintains
a list of each package’s exported API
in files separate from the actual packages:</p>
<pre><code>% cat go/api/go1.21.txt
pkg bytes, func ContainsFunc([]uint8, func(int32) bool) bool #54386
pkg bytes, method (*Buffer) AvailableBuffer() []uint8 #53685
pkg bytes, method (*Buffer) Available() int #53685
pkg cmp, func Compare[$0 Ordered]($0, $0) int #59488
pkg cmp, func Less[$0 Ordered]($0, $0) bool #59488
pkg cmp, type Ordered interface {} #59488
pkg context, func AfterFunc(Context, func()) func() bool #57928
pkg context, func WithDeadlineCause(Context, time.Time, error) (Context, CancelFunc) #56661
pkg context, func WithoutCancel(Context) Context #40221
pkg context, func WithTimeoutCause(Context, time.Duration, error) (Context, CancelFunc) #56661
</code></pre>
<p>One of our standard tests checks that the actual package APIs match those files.
If we add new API to a package, the test breaks unless we add it to the API files.
And if we change or remove API, the test breaks too. This helps us avoid mistakes.
However, a tool like this only finds a certain class of problems, namely API changes and removals.
There are other ways to make incompatible changes to Go.</p>
<p>That leads us to the second approach we use to keep Go boring: testing.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>The most effective way to find unexpected incompatibilities
is to run existing tests against the development version of the next Go release.
We test the development version of Go against
all of Google’s internal Go code on a rolling basis.
When tests are passing, we install that commit as
Google’s production Go toolchain.</p>
<p>If a change breaks tests inside Google,
we assume it will also break tests outside Google,
and we look for ways to reduce the impact.
Most of the time, we roll back the change entirely
or find a way to rewrite it so that it doesn’t break any programs.
Sometimes, however, we conclude that the change is
important to make and “compatible” even though it does
break some programs.
In that case, we still work to reduce the impact as much as possible,
and then we document the potential problem in the release notes.</p>
<p>Here are two examples of that kind of subtle compatibility problems
we found by testing Go inside Google but still included in Go 1.1.</p>
<h2 id="struct">Struct Literals and New Fields</h2>
<p>Here is some code that runs fine in Go 1:</p>
<pre><code>package main

import "net"

var myAddr = &amp;net.TCPAddr{
    net.IPv4(18, 26, 4, 9),
    80,
}
</code></pre>
<p>Package <code>main</code> declares a global variable <code>myAddr</code>,
which is a composite literal of type <code>net.TCPAddr</code>.
In Go 1, package <code>net</code> defines the type <code>TCPAddr</code>
as a struct with two fields, <code>IP</code> and <code>Port</code>.
Those match the fields in the composite literal,
so the program compiles.</p>
<p>In Go 1.1, the program stopped compiling, with a compiler error
that said “too few initializers in struct literal.”
The problem is that we added a third field, <code>Zone</code>, to <code>net.TCPAddr</code>,
and this program is missing the value for that third field.
The fix is to rewrite the program using tagged literals,
so that it builds in both versions of Go:</p>
<pre><code>var myAddr = &amp;net.TCPAddr{
    IP:   net.IPv4(18, 26, 4, 9),
    Port: 80,
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since this literal doesn’t specify a value for <code>Zone</code>, it will use the
zero value (an empty string in this case).</p>
<p>This requirement to use composite literals for standard library
structs is explicitly called out in the <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1compat">compatibility document</a>,
and <code>go vet</code> reports literals that need tags
to ensure compatibility with later versions of Go.
This problem was new enough in Go 1.1
to merit a short comment in the release notes.
Nowadays we just mention the new field.</p>
<h2 id="precision">Time Precision</h2>
<p>The second problem we found while testing Go 1.1
had nothing to do with APIs at all.
It had to do with time.</p>
<p>Shortly after Go 1 was released, someone pointed
out that <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/time/#Now"><code>time.Now</code></a>
returned times with microsecond precision,
but with some extra code,
it could return times with nanosecond precision instead.
That sounds good, right?
More precision is better.
So we made that change.</p>
<p>That broke a handful of tests inside Google that
were schematically like this one:</p>
<pre><code>func TestSaveTime(t *testing.T) {
    t1 := time.Now()
    save(t1)
    if t2 := load(); t2 != t1 {
        t.Fatalf("load() = %v, want %v", t1, t2)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This code calls <code>time.Now</code>
and then round-trips the result
through <code>save</code> and <code>load</code>
and expects to get the same time back.
If <code>save</code> and <code>load</code> use a representation
that only stores microsecond precision,
that will work fine in Go 1 but fail in Go 1.1.</p>
<p>To help fix tests like this,
we added <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/time/#Time.Round"><code>Round</code></a> and
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/time/#Time.Truncate"><code>Truncate</code></a> methods
to discard unwanted precision,
and in the release notes,
we documented the possible problem
and the new methods to help fix it.</p>
<p>These examples show how
testing finds different kinds of incompatibility
than the API checks do.
Of course, testing is not a complete guarantee
of compatibility either,
but it’s more complete than just API checks.
There are many examples of problems we’ve found
while testing that we decided did break the compatibility
rules and rolled back before the release.
The time precision change is an interesting example
of something that broke programs but that we released
anyway.
We made the change because the improved precision
was better and was allowed within the documented behavior of the function.</p>
<p>This example shows that sometimes, despite significant effort
and attention, there are times when changing Go means
breaking Go programs.
The changes are, strictly speaking, “compatible” in the sense
of the Go 1 document, but they still break programs.
Most of these compatibility issues can be placed
in one of three categories:
output changes,
input changes,
and protocol changes.</p>
<h2 id="output">Output Changes</h2>
<p>An output change happens when a function gives a different output
than it used to, but the new output is just as correct as, or even more correct than,
the old output.
If existing code is written to expect only the old output, it will break.
We just saw an example of this, with <code>time.Now</code> adding nanosecond precision.</p>
<p><strong>Sort.</strong> Another example happened in Go 1.6,
when we changed the implementation of sort
to run about 10% faster.
Here’s an example program
that sorts a list of colors by length of name:</p>
<pre><code>colors := strings.Fields(
    `black white red orange yellow green blue indigo violet`)
sort.Sort(ByLen(colors))
fmt.Println(colors)

Go 1.5:  [red blue green white black yellow orange indigo violet]
Go 1.6:  [red blue white green black orange yellow indigo violet]
</code></pre>
<p>Changing sort algorithms often changes
how equal elements are ordered,
and that happened here.
Go 1.5 returned green, white, black, in that order.
Go 1.6 returned white, green, black.</p>
<p>Sort is clearly allowed to return equal results in any order it likes,
and this change made it 10% faster, which is great.
But programs that expect a specific output will break.
This is a good example of why compatibility is so hard.
We don’t want to break programs,
but we also don’t want to be locked in
to undocumented implementation details.</p>
<p><strong>Compress/flate.</strong> As another example, in Go 1.8 we improved
<code>compress/flate</code> to produce smaller outputs,
with roughly the same CPU and memory overheads.
That sounds like a win-win, but it broke a project inside Google
that needed reproducible archive builds:
now they couldn’t reproduce their old archives.
They forked <code>compress/flate</code> and <code>compress/gzip</code>
to keep a copy of the old algorithm.</p>
<p>We do a similar thing with the Go compiler,
using a fork of the <code>sort</code> package (<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/go1.21.0/src/cmd/dist/buildtool.go#22" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">and others</a>)
so that the compiler produces the same results
even when it is built using earlier versions of Go.</p>
<p>For output change incompatibilities like these,
the best answer is to write programs and tests
that accept any valid output,
and to use these kinds of breakages
as an opportunity to change your testing strategy,
not just update the expected answers.
If you need truly reproducible outputs,
the next best answer is to fork the code
to insulate yourself from changes,
but remember that
you’re also insulating yourself from bug fixes.</p>
<h2 id="input">Input Changes</h2>
<p>An input change happens when a function changes which inputs it accepts
or how it processes them.</p>
<p><strong>ParseInt.</strong> For example, Go 1.13 added support for
underscores in large numbers for readability.
Along with the language change,
we made <code>strconv.ParseInt</code> accept the new syntax.
This change didn’t break anything inside Google,
but much later we heard from an external user
whose code did break.
Their program used numbers separated by underscores
as a data format.
It tried <code>ParseInt</code> first and only fell back to checking for underscores if <code>ParseInt</code> failed.
When <code>ParseInt</code> stopped failing, the underscore-handling code stopped running.</p>
<p><strong>ParseIP.</strong> As another example, Go’s <code>net.ParseIP</code>,
followed the examples in early IP RFCs,
which often showed decimal IP addresses with leading zeros.
It read the IP address 18.032.4.011 address as 18.32.4.11, just with a few extra zeros.
We found out much later that BSD-derived C libraries
interpret leading zeros in IP addresses as starting an octal number:
in those libraries, 18.032.4.011 means 18.26.4.9!</p>
<p>This was a serious mismatch
between Go and the rest of the world,
but changing the meaning of leading zeros
from one Go release to the next
would be a serious mismatch too.
It would be a huge incompatibility.
In the end, we decided to change <code>net.ParseIP</code> in Go 1.17
to reject leading zeros entirely.
This stricter parsing ensures that when Go and C
both parse an IP address successfully,
or when old and new Go versions do,
they all agree about what it means.</p>
<p>This change didn’t break anything inside Google,
but the Kubernetes team was concerned about
saved configurations that might have parsed before
but would stop parsing with Go 1.17.
Addresses with leading zeros
probably should be removed from those configs,
since Go interprets them differently from
essentially every other language,
but that should happen on Kubernetes’s timeline, not Go’s.
To avoid the semantic change,
Kubernetes started using its own forked copy
of the original <code>net.ParseIP</code>.</p>
<p>The best response to input changes is to process user input
by first validating the syntax you want to accept
before parsing the values,
but sometimes you need to fork the code instead.</p>
<h2 id="protocol">Protocol Changes</h2>
<p>The final common kind of incompatibility is protocol changes.
A protocol change is a change made to a package
that ends up externally visible
in the protocols a program uses
to communicate with the external world.
Almost any change can become externally visible
in certain programs, as we saw with <code>ParseInt</code> and <code>ParseIP</code>,
but protocol changes are externally visible
in essentially all programs.</p>
<p><strong>HTTP/2.</strong> A clear example of a protocol change is when
Go 1.6 added automatic support for HTTP/2.
Suppose a Go 1.5 client is connecting to an HTTP/2-capable
server over a network with middleboxes that happen to
break HTTP/2.
Since Go 1.5 only uses HTTP/1.1, the program works fine.
But then updating to Go 1.6 breaks the program, because Go 1.6
starts using HTTP/2, and in this context, HTTP/2 doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Go aims to support modern protocols by default,
but this example shows that enabling HTTP/2 can break programs
through no fault of their own (nor any fault of Go’s).
Developers in this situation could go back to using Go 1.5,
but that’s not very satisfying.
Instead, Go 1.6 documented the change in the release notes
and made it straightforward to disable HTTP/2.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.6#http2">Go 1.6 documented two ways</a> to disable HTTP/2:
configure the <code>TLSNextProto</code> field explicitly using the package API,
or set the GODEBUG environment variable:</p>
<pre><code>GODEBUG=http2client=0 ./myprog
GODEBUG=http2server=0 ./myprog
GODEBUG=http2client=0,http2server=0 ./myprog
</code></pre>
<p>As we’ll see later, Go 1.21 generalizes this GODEBUG mechanism
to make it a standard for all potentially breaking changes.</p>
<p><strong>SHA1.</strong> Here’s a subtler example of a protocol change.
No one should be using SHA1-based certificates for HTTPS anymore.
Certificate authorities stopped issuing them in 2015,
and all the major browsers stopped accepting them in 2017.
In early 2020, Go 1.18 disabled support for them by default,
with a GODEBUG setting to override that change.
We also announced our intent to remove the GODEBUG setting in Go 1.19.</p>
<p>The Kubernetes team let us know that
some installations still use private SHA1 certificates.
Putting aside the security questions,
it’s not Kubernetes’s place to force these enterprises to
upgrade their certificate infrastructure,
and it would be extremely painful to fork <code>crypto/tls</code>
and <code>net/http</code> to keep SHA1 support.
Instead, we agreed to keep the override in place longer than we had planned,
to create more time for an orderly transition.
After all, we want to break as few programs as possible.</p>
<h2 id="expanded-godebug-support-in-go-121">Expanded GODEBUG Support in Go 1.21</h2>
<p>To improve backwards compatibility even in these subtle cases
we’ve been examining, Go 1.21 expands and formalizes the use of GODEBUG.</p>
<p>To begin with, for any change that is permitted by Go 1 compatibility but
still might break existing programs,
we do all the work we just saw to understand potential
compatibility problems, and we engineer the change to keep as many existing
programs working as possible.
For the remaining programs, the new approach is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We will define a new GODEBUG setting that allows
individual programs to opt out of the new behavior.
A GODEBUG setting may not be added if doing so is infeasible, but that should be extremely rare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GODEBUG settings added for compatibility will be maintained for a minimum
of two years (four Go releases). Some, such as <code>http2client</code> and <code>http2server</code>,
will be maintained much longer, even indefinitely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When possible, each GODEBUG setting has an associated
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/runtime/metrics/"><code>runtime/metrics</code></a> counter
named <code>/godebug/non-default-behavior/&lt;name&gt;:events</code>
that counts the number of times a particular program’s behavior
has changed based on a non-default value for that setting.
For example, when <code>GODEBUG=http2client=0</code> is set,
<code>/godebug/non-default-behavior/http2client:events</code> counts the
number of HTTP transports that the program has configured without HTTP/2 support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A program’s GODEBUG settings are configured to match the Go version
listed in the main package’s <code>go.mod</code> file.
If your program’s <code>go.mod</code> file says <code>go 1.20</code> and you update to
a Go 1.21 toolchain, any GODEBUG-controlled behaviors changed in
Go 1.21 will retain their old Go 1.20 behavior until you change the
<code>go.mod</code> to say <code>go 1.21</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A program can change individual GODEBUG settings by using <code>//go:debug</code> lines
in package <code>main</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All GODEBUG settings are documented in a <a href="https://go.dev/doc/godebug#history">single, central list</a>
for easy reference.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach means that each new version of Go should be the best possible
implementation of older versions of Go, even preserving behaviors that were
changed in compatible-but-breaking ways in later releases when compiling old code.</p>
<p>For example, in Go 1.21, <code>panic(nil)</code> now causes a (non-nil) runtime panic,
so that the result of <a href="https://go.dev/ref/spec/#Handling_panics"><code>recover</code></a> now reliably
reports whether the current goroutine is panicking.
This new behavior is controlled by a GODEBUG setting and therefore dependent
on the main package’s <code>go.mod</code>’s <code>go</code> line: if it says <code>go 1.20</code> or earlier,
<code>panic(nil)</code> is still allowed.
If it says <code>go 1.21</code> or later, <code>panic(nil)</code> turns into a panic with a <code>runtime.PanicNilError</code>.
And the version-based default can be overridden explicitly by adding a line like this to package main:</p>
<pre><code>//go:debug panicnil=1
</code></pre>
<p>This combination of features means that programs can update to newer toolchains
while preserving the behaviors of the earlier toolchains they used,
can apply finer-grained control over specific settings as needed,
and can use production monitoring to understand which jobs make
use of these non-default behaviors in practice.
Combined, those should make rolling out new toolchains even
smoother than in the past.</p>
<p>See “<a href="https://go.dev/doc/godebug">Go, Backwards Compatibility, and GODEBUG</a>” for more details.</p>
<h2 id="go2">An Update on Go 2</h2>
<p>In the quoted text from “<a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1compat">Go 1 and the Future of Go Programs</a>”
at the top of this post, the ellipsis hid the following qualifier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At some indefinite point, a Go 2 specification may arise,
but until that time, [… all the compatibility details …].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That raises an obvious question: when should we expect the
Go 2 specification that breaks old Go 1 programs?</p>
<p>The answer is never.
Go 2, in the sense of breaking with the past
and no longer compiling old programs,
is never going to happen.
Go 2 in the sense of being the major revision of Go 1
we started toward in 2017 has already happened.</p>
<p>There will not be a Go 2 that breaks Go 1 programs.
Instead, we are going to double down on compatibility,
which is far more valuable than any possible break with the past.
In fact, we believe that prioritizing compatibility
was the most important design decision we made for Go 1.</p>
<p>So what you will see over the next few years
is plenty of new, exciting work, but done in a careful,
compatible way, so that we can keep your upgrades from
one toolchain to the next as boring as possible.</p>

  </li>
</ul>
<p>
In this article, I will explain why Elixir has a dot when calling anonymous functions. I have explained this elsewhere in forums and mailing lists but I guess an article makes it more official.</p>
<p>
In other words, Elixir has this:</p>
<pre><code><span>some_fun</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7980475631-1">fn</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7980475631-1">end</span><span>
</span><span>some_fun</span><span>.</span><span data-group-id="7980475631-2">(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span data-group-id="7980475631-2">)</span><span>
</span><span>#=&gt; 3</span></code></pre>
<p>
Note the dot between the variable and the arguments. The main reason for this choice is because functions in Elixir have to be identified by name and arity (the number of arguments it receives).</p>
<h2>
A fictional language</h2>
<p>
In order to understand why the dot is required, let’s consider a fictional language that runs on the Erlang VM. Functions in the Erlang VM are identified by their name and their arity. In other words, we don’t have functions that receive a variadic number of arguments, they are always fixed.</p>
<p>
Consequently, the following is not possible in Elixir:</p>
<pre><code><span>plus</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1907624653-1">fn</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="1907624653-2">(</span><span data-group-id="1907624653-2">)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="1907624653-3">(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span data-group-id="1907624653-3">)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="1907624653-1">end</span><span>

</span><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="1907624653-4">(</span><span data-group-id="1907624653-4">)</span><span> </span><span>#=&gt; 0</span><span>
</span><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="1907624653-5">(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span data-group-id="1907624653-5">)</span><span> </span><span>#=&gt; 3</span></code></pre>
<p>
But let’s imagine for a second this actually worked. Our functions have multiple arities and we don’t need a dot to call them. Now let’s proceed and define a function, called <code>sum</code>, that adds all elements in a list. Our initial implementation could look like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span><span> </span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="7838510565-1">(</span><span>list</span><span data-group-id="7838510565-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7838510565-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>plus</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7838510565-3">fn</span><span>
    </span><span data-group-id="7838510565-4">(</span><span data-group-id="7838510565-4">)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>
    </span><span data-group-id="7838510565-5">(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span data-group-id="7838510565-5">)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="7838510565-3">end</span><span>

  </span><span>Enum</span><span>.</span><span>reduce</span><span data-group-id="7838510565-6">(</span><span>list</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="7838510565-7">(</span><span data-group-id="7838510565-7">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7838510565-8">fn</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="7838510565-9">(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span data-group-id="7838510565-9">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7838510565-8">end</span><span data-group-id="7838510565-6">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="7838510565-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Notice how I am calling <code>plus</code> with a variadic number of arguments: first to get the initial <code>reduce</code> argument and then to reduce each element. Calling <code>sum([1, 2, 3])</code> would return 6.</p>
<p>
Let’s keep moving forward with this fictional language. We figure out the <code>plus</code> implementation is actually quite useful and decide to move it to its own function:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span><span> </span><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="5778145769-1">(</span><span data-group-id="5778145769-1">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>
</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="5778145769-2">(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span data-group-id="5778145769-2">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>

</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="5778145769-3">(</span><span>list</span><span data-group-id="5778145769-3">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="5778145769-4">do</span><span>
  </span><span>Enum</span><span>.</span><span>reduce</span><span data-group-id="5778145769-5">(</span><span>list</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="5778145769-6">(</span><span data-group-id="5778145769-6">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="5778145769-7">fn</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="5778145769-8">(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span data-group-id="5778145769-8">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="5778145769-7">end</span><span data-group-id="5778145769-5">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="5778145769-4">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
The refactoring was a success as we just moved the definition out and everything still works. Note we didn’t have to change the actual <code>sum</code> logic, as we can use <code>plus()</code> to call a function stored in a variable or a function defined in the same module/context.</p>
<p>
This is how languages like Clojure, Scheme, and Haskell behave. You could even go as far as doing something akin to:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span><span> </span><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="5887257432-1">(</span><span data-group-id="5887257432-1">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>
</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="5887257432-2">(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span data-group-id="5887257432-2">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>

</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="5887257432-3">(</span><span>list</span><span data-group-id="5887257432-3">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="5887257432-4">do</span><span>
  </span><span># A one-off plus implementation</span><span>

<p>
And now <code>sum([1, 2, 3])</code> will return 7 due to the wrong initial value. In the example above, we introduced a variable <code>plus</code> and it shadowed the call to the <code>plus</code> function defined in the module. In other words, identifiers in those languages refer to both variables and functions and <strong>they can be used interchangeably</strong>. You know if a variable or a function will be used by analyzing the scope.</p>
<p>
These languages are similar to Lisp-1 languages because there is a single namespace for both variables and function names.</p>
<h2>
Back to Elixir</h2>
<p>
In order to understand the limitation within Elixir, let’s try to do the same change. Imagine we have this code, which is valid Elixir:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span><span> </span><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="5201765688-1">(</span><span data-group-id="5201765688-1">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>
</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="5201765688-2">(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span data-group-id="5201765688-2">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>

</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="5201765688-3">(</span><span>list</span><span data-group-id="5201765688-3">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="5201765688-4">do</span><span>
  </span><span>Enum</span><span>.</span><span>reduce</span><span data-group-id="5201765688-5">(</span><span>list</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="5201765688-6">(</span><span data-group-id="5201765688-6">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="5201765688-7">fn</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="5201765688-8">(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span data-group-id="5201765688-8">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="5201765688-7">end</span><span data-group-id="5201765688-5">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="5201765688-4">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
And we want to introduce a one-off sum implementation without changing the actual <code>sum</code> call, as we did in the previous section:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span><span> </span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="9875814501-1">(</span><span>list</span><span data-group-id="9875814501-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="9875814501-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>plus</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>??</span><span>?
</span><span>
  </span><span>Enum</span><span>.</span><span>reduce</span><span data-group-id="9875814501-3">(</span><span>list</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="9875814501-4">(</span><span data-group-id="9875814501-4">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="9875814501-5">fn</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="9875814501-6">(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span data-group-id="9875814501-6">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="9875814501-5">end</span><span data-group-id="9875814501-3">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="9875814501-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Unfortunately, there is no possible implementation of <code>???</code> in Elixir that makes the code above work. That’s because anonymous functions in Elixir only have a single arity… so we can implement <code>plus()</code> or <code>plus(x, y)</code> but not both. In other words, because functions in the Erlang VM are identified by name and arity, such that definitions with the same name and different arities are effectively different functions, we can’t fully leverage the benefits of Lisp-1 languages.</p>
<h2>
Once again: why the dot?</h2>
<p>
With the context above, I had to answer the following question when designing Elixir: should anonymous functions have a dot when invoked or not?</p>
<p>
We could skip the dot when calling anonymous function in Elixir but I believe doing so would be a net negative. If <code>plus()</code> allowed invoking a module function and calling a function in a variable, we would introduce the ambiguity found in Lisp-1 languages but without reaping all benefits of said languages.</p>
<p>
Therefore, we made it so Elixir is a Lisp-2 language, where variables and function names live in two distinct namespaces. That’s ultimately the difference between Lisp-1 and Lisp-2, the number of “namespaces” they offer. Since they live in different namespaces, we need distinct function call syntaxes for each namespace. Although this is often seen as “uncommon”, it comes with some benefits. Let’s take a look at our sample code again but with a different perspective:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span><span> </span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="8143195322-1">(</span><span>list</span><span data-group-id="8143195322-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8143195322-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>plus</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>??</span><span>?
</span><span>
  </span><span>Enum</span><span>.</span><span>reduce</span><span data-group-id="8143195322-3">(</span><span>list</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="8143195322-4">(</span><span data-group-id="8143195322-4">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8143195322-5">fn</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="8143195322-6">(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span data-group-id="8143195322-6">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8143195322-5">end</span><span data-group-id="8143195322-3">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="8143195322-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
In Elixir, it is not possible to introduce a variable named <code>plus</code> that will change the behaviour of the <code>plus(...)</code> function calls right below it. This eliminates the chance of naming conflicts and can be a comforting guarantee when reading and writing code! On the other hand, Lisp-1 languages require you to analyze what is in scope in order to determine what is the exact code that <code>plus(...)</code> will invoke. Which approach you prefer, expressiveness vs clarity, is the crux of the Lisp-1 vs Lisp-2 debate.</p>
<p>
If we didn’t have the dot when calling anonymous functions in Elixir, we would have the worst of both worlds: we would lose clarity but be unable to fully leverage the expressiveness found in Lisp-1 languages.</p>
<h2>
But Erlang!</h2>
<p>
At this point, developers familiar with Erlang may point out that the dot is not required in Erlang. That’s because variables and function names in Erlang have different syntaxes, which puts them in distinct namespaces by definition. Variables start in uppercase, while function names in lowercase. Here is how an anonymous function in Erlang looks like:</p>
<pre><code><span>Var</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>fun</span><span data-group-id="6228624603-1">(</span><span>X</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Y</span><span data-group-id="6228624603-1">)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>X</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>Y</span><span> </span><span>end</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>Var</span><span data-group-id="6228624603-2">(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span data-group-id="6228624603-2">)</span><span>.</span></code></pre>
<p>
Similarly, Erlang has the same guarantees as Elixir in that it is not possible to introduce a variable that affects function calls happening within the same function - as the syntaxes differ:</p>
<pre><code><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="9793753473-1">(</span><span data-group-id="9793753473-1">)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>
</span><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="9793753473-2">(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>B</span><span data-group-id="9793753473-2">)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>A</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>B</span><span>.</span><span>

</span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="9793753473-3">(</span><span>List</span><span data-group-id="9793753473-3">)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span>
  </span><span>Plus</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>?</span><span>?</span><span>?</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>% no such thing</span><span>
  </span><span>lists</span><span>:</span><span>foldl</span><span data-group-id="9793753473-4">(</span><span>fun</span><span data-group-id="9793753473-5">(</span><span>X</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Y</span><span data-group-id="9793753473-5">)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="9793753473-6">(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span data-group-id="9793753473-6">)</span><span> </span><span>end</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>plus</span><span data-group-id="9793753473-7">(</span><span data-group-id="9793753473-7">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Plus</span><span data-group-id="9793753473-4">)</span><span>.</span></code></pre>
<p>
Similarly, to pass a module function as an anonymous function, explicit conversion is required (as in Lisp-2 languages):</p>
<pre><code><span>Var</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>fun</span><span> </span><span>plus</span><span>/</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>Var</span><span data-group-id="5925623578-1">(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span data-group-id="5925623578-1">)</span><span>.</span></code></pre>
<p>
Which is the same as in Elixir:</p>
<pre><code><span>var</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>plus</span><span>/</span><span>2</span><span>
</span><span>var</span><span>.</span><span data-group-id="5257980081-1">(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span data-group-id="5257980081-1">)</span></code></pre>
<p>
In other words, the languages semantics are precisely the same. They simply use different syntactical constructs to disambiguate. The fact Elixir uses the dot and Erlang does not, does not add new capabilities to any of them. Other languages may not require the dot when calling anonymous functions either, but they may still use different syntaxes when calling those different namespaces.</p>
<p>
Does this mean all languages running on the Erlang VM need to have those exact same semantics? Not necessarily. A statically typed language, for example, could support multiple arities in the same anonymous function and track how the different arities are used statically to still emit efficient code. Or even forbid multiple arities for the same name altogether!</p>
<h2>
Summing up</h2>
<p>
I hope this clarifies one of the most asked parts about the Elixir syntax and answers “Why the dot?”.</p>
<p>
TL;DR: given the lack of Tabs vs Spaces discussions nowadays, I resurface the Lisp-1 vs Lisp-2 debate to keep programming forums active.</p>

            <article>
    
    <section>
        <p>I’m a little embarrassed to write this post as I’m normally very careful about stuff like this, but this week I was successfully tricked by a <a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org/">dark pattern</a>. From <a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org/">darkpatterns.org</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dark Patterns</strong> are tricks used in websites and apps that make you do things that you didn’t mean to, like buying or signing up for something.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="musescore">MuseScore</h2>
<p>The site that got me is <a href="https://musescore.com/">musescore.com</a>, which is the online music score sharing platform that complements the free <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MuseScore">MuseScore</a> scorewriter program. The MuseScore website provides downloadable scores for music in the public domain, MuseScore users’ original compositions, and arrangements of copyrighted works. Public-domain music is available to download with a free account, but to download original compositions or arrangements of copyrighted works, you need a paid subscription.</p>
<p>The ethics of this business model, and copyright in general, are a whole other can of worms that I won’t get into here, but I do want to note that even if they hadn’t engaged in deceptive design practices, you should definitely boycott them because their Director of Strategy <a href="https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1417085393762099200">publicly threatened to get someone deported for alleged copyright violations</a> — I only learned about this when doing research for this blog post but it’s absolutely vile.</p>
<h2 id="taking-the-bait">Taking the bait</h2>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to download an arrangement of the jazz standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn_Leaves_(1945_song)">Autumn Leaves</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kosma">Joseph Kozma</a> for piano and violin to play along with my partner. To download user-created arrangements, you must pay for a “PRO” subscription, but MuseScore offers a <a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/forced-continuity">1-week free trial which automatically converts into a yearly paid subscription at the end of the trial period</a>. No problem — I just wanted to download this one score, so I signed up for the free trial intending to download it and immediately cancel.</p>
<p>It turns out MuseScore uses a tricky <a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/roach-motel">‘roach motel’</a> dark pattern — it’s easy to get into the free trial, but it’s hard to get out. In fact, when you create your account and start the free trial, you are <em>unable to manage your subscription settings</em> for at least one hour. <a href="https://help.musescore.com/hc/en-us/articles/209540009">MuseScore claims this is because “your account is being set up”</a> but this is obviously bullshit as you can immediately begin using all of your account features — downloading scores, editing your profile, etc. — except for editing your subscription. The real reason you are locked out of editing your subscription is obvious: MuseScore hopes you’ll start the trial, download one or two scores, then forget about it until you get hit with the automatic yearly charge at the end of the trial period. Unfortunately, that’s exactly just what happened to me because I forgot to set a reminder to cancel the trial, foolishly trusting my faulty human memory; I was charged for the yearly subscription on Monday morning.</p>
<h2 id="getting-off-the-hook">Getting off the hook</h2>
<p>This sucks, but there’s little to be done about it — I should’ve set a reminder! I immediately logged in to cancel the auto-renewal so that I don’t get hit with the renewal fee in a year, and MuseScore is using even more dark patterns in the subscription cancellation dialog box, which I’ve included a screenshot of below.</p>
<p><img src="https://gadanidis.ca/images/musescore_cancellation_dialog.png" title="The dialog box to end the MuseScore subscription. There are two buttons, one reading 'I want to keep my benefits' and the other reading 'I do not want my benefits'."></p>
<p>At the top it says “your benefits will remain active for the current paid period” — they’d better, given how much I was just charged for the yearly subscription! However, to end the subscription you have to click the button that says “I do not want my benefits”, which makes it seem like you’ll immediately lose access if you click on it (you don’t). This is known as <a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/confirmshaming">‘confirmshaming’</a> and is intended to discourage you from cancelling.</p>
<p>The buttons are also styled in a misleading way: The button you need to click, “I do not want my benefits”, is styled like a cancel button which you’d expect to close the window without taking any action (coloured the same as the background, on the right side of the screen). In contrast, the “I want to keep my benefits” button, which is styled like a confirmation button (presented in a more prominent colour, on the left side of the screen) is actually the ‘cancel’ button, which does not end the subscription. If you don’t read the text carefully, it would be easy to think that your subscription has already been cancelled and this dialog box is to decide whether you want to keep the benefits for the remainder of the subscription period.</p>
<h2 id="getting-some-money-back">Getting some money back</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://musescore.com/legal/terms">MuseScore terms of service</a> state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if you cancel your subscription during the first fourteen (14) days of your subscription term you will receive a refund of the difference between the then-in-effect and current subscription fee to which You are subscribed and the then-in-effect and current monthly subscription fee. Your account will not auto-renew for any recurring periodic charges at the end of the subscription term. As a courtesy to you we will convert your Account to a free account at the end of the 30-day period.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can’t actually cancel your subscription online; you can only cancel the auto-renewal. To cancel your actual subscription and get a partial refund, you have to submit a support request (another <a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/roach-motel">roach motel</a>).</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Musescore/comments/pp39b6/regarding_refund/">this Reddit post</a>, though, it seems MuseScore neglects to actually inform you about their own terms of service when you request a refund, and they instead offer you a 35% refund, far below what you are actually entitled to. I didn’t want to deal with any of that so I included a quotation from the ToS in my refund request, and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In line with the ToS, please cancel my subscription and refund the difference between the yearly subscription fee and the current monthly subscription fee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not to be deterred, though, the support desk <em>still</em> told me that they talked to the head office and were able to negotiate a special offer for me: either a free extension of my subscription or a 35% refund. They even did the button thing again! The option they want you to click (no refund) is in green and on the left, while the refund option (which is actually less than you’re entitled to) is in grey and on the right.</p>
<p><img src="https://gadanidis.ca/images/musescore_email.png" title="Screenshot of an email from MuseScore support offering me either 10 extra months or a 35% refund by clicking one of two buttons, with text beneath noting that the maximum refund is actually 60 USD."></p>
<p>To access the maximum refund you’re entitled to, which gets just a passing mention beneath the two more prominent options, there’s no button. You have to email back again, which I did, and the refund has finally just gone through.</p>
<h2 id="coda">Coda</h2>
<p>I’m disappointed in myself for getting tricked, but I’m even more disappointed to see an online service associated with a <a href="https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore">free and open source scorewriter</a> engaging in such misleading, dishonest, and anti-human design practices.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, deceptive business practices seem to be par for the course for <a href="https://mu.se/">Muse Group</a>, MuseScore’s parent company. They were recently in the news after acquiring the popular audio-editing software <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27727150">quietly adding spyware</a>. They apologized and pinky-promised they wouldn’t do it again, but you should probably switch to <a href="https://github.com/tenacityteam/tenacity">Tenacity</a> anyway. And if you’re looking for open-source music transcription software to replace MuseScore, you can’t do better than <a href="https://lilypond.org/">GNU LilyPond</a>.</p>

<p>Stack Exchange is one of the greatest compendia of human knowledge ever produced. Where else can you ask questions and get answers from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange?ref=thediff.co#Notable_users">ten different Fields Medalists</a>? (Not to mention Peter Shor of Shor's algorithm <a href="https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/5373/why-did-the-alexandrine-become-the-natural-metre-for-french-verse-drama-where/5399?ref=thediff.co#5399">explaining why French and English renaissance poetry use different metres</a>? You can even use it to see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15445285/how-can-i-connect-to-a-tor-hidden-service-using-curl-in-php?ref=thediff.co">a snapshot of the early efforts</a> behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)?ref=thediff.co">a once-thriving e-commerce site</a>.) Plus, all of this knowledge is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/licensing?ref=thediff.co">Creative Commons-licensed</a>, so anyone can "remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially," as long as they give credit. As a consequence, it's a big chunk of the programming-specific data ingested by AI models.</p>
<p>And, as a result of <em>that</em>, Stack Exchange has seen a material decline in usage. The first sign was the most ominous Google Trends graph I've ever seen:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.thediff.co/content/images/2023/08/so_vs_chatgpt.png" alt="so_vs_chatgpt" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>(This one cuts off at the beginning of December, because if it's extended any further it re-scales until Stack Overflow is just a flat line.)</p>
<p>Q&amp;A sites like Stack Exchange combine two kinds of businesses that are usually distinct, but have historically been incredibly powerful together: two-sided networks and SEO plays. The two-sidedness of two-sided networks is always a bit blurred (some fraction of Uber riders own cars, the vast majority of Airbnb users have homes—with at least one unoccupied bed when they're staying at an Airbnb), and, at least for programming, that’s the case here as well. Stack Exchange’s most well known forum, Stack Overflow, must maintain a critical mass in two groups: people with questions about programming and people with answers. And, luckily for them, programming is an incredibly heterogeneous space, where many people end up mastering one set of technologies but get stuck using another one. So, if a site is big enough, someone can be a beginner in one set of questions and an expert when it comes to providing a different set of answers.</p>
<p>On the SEO side, this kind of content naturally generates pages that rank well in search (and Stack Exchange has done its work to ensure that they get the credit they deserve). In long-tail SEO, there are often either zero good results for a query or exactly one. And SEO has many feedback loops. For example, search engines use autocomplete to guide users towards the queries they're trying to write. And those autocompletes are at least partially influenced by what information is available. So queries tend to converge on the phrasing used by the most prominent site that answers them.</p>
<p>One takeaway from this is that if you want to look at the health of a company with this kind of model, you actually have several options: revenue and traffic will be fairly backwards-looking—the way to get revenue from job ads is <em>to have had traffic in the past</em>, and the way to get traffic is <em>to have had good answers and questions even further in the past</em>. By looking at specific kinds of questions we can even look at the historical shape of technology trends and at the granular impact of AI on developer behavior.</p>
<p>Very fortunately for us, Stack Exchange is committed to transparency, and offers a <a href="https://archive.org/details/stackexchange">quarterly data dump of all questions and answers</a>. So, if you're truly curious, you can track trends in tags over time. For example, here's a chart of the volume of questions about programming languages:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.thediff.co/content/images/2023/08/so_pl.png" alt="so_pl" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>There are a few things worth remarking on: question volume generally grew until about 2014, and then stabilized for a while before going into a gentle decline. There's a seasonal pattern that's common for informational, non-commercial queries: a big drop associated with the holidays, a moderate rise in late spring and in mid-December (coinciding with exam season).<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> There was a surge in question volume during Covid, as a combination of pandemic hobby projects and hasty reworking of existing infrastructure to accommodate work-from-home (for B2B software) and the shift from brick-and-mortar to digital (for consumer-facing products).</p>
<p>And then ChatGPT hit: the holiday lull never really ended; question volume in January 2022 was running at basically the same pace as December 2020, but in 2023 the question volume only recovered about half of the holiday drop, and then went almost straight down from there. Question volume in May 2023 was about half the level of November 2022, was below the holiday drops typical throughout mid to late 2010s, and was around the level of late 2011.</p>
<p>The earlier slowdown makes some sense. Like <a href="https://www.thediff.co/archive/its-hard-to-build-a-durable-business-selling-durable-goods/">the durable goods business</a>, question volume is some function of 1) new features, new edge cases, new performance bottlenecks, etc., and 2) the one-time effect of answering questions <em>everyone</em> has when they're new to a language. "<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/252703/what-is-the-difference-between-pythons-list-methods-append-and-extend?ref=thediff.co">What is the difference between <code>append()</code> and <code>extend()</code>?</a>" only needs to be asked once, and will be answered forevermore, so any Q&amp;A site that wins its vertical should, in fact, show a peak in question volume that doesn't imply a peak in utility.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>You can see this pattern clearly by looking at languages that have been in use for a long time. Here's Java, for example:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.thediff.co/content/images/2023/08/so_java.png" alt="so_java" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Questions about Java had already declined by almost three quarters from their peak <em>before</em> the introduction of ChatGPT, and are down another 25% since. For something that was adopted a bit later, like React, question volume had just managed to reach the plateau where all the questions beginners ask had been thoroughly answered when ChatGPT hit, and the result was a larger drop of around a third year-over-year:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.thediff.co/content/images/2023/08/so_react.png" alt="so_react" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>But there are some counterexamples, with telling commonalities. Consider this set of technologies (in this case, we're zooming in on recent months and normalizing so the various trends are readable):</p>
<p><img src="https://www.thediff.co/content/images/2023/08/so_proprietary.png" alt="so_proprietary" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>There really isn't much to see here. Which is surprising! A new competitor was introduced, rapidly got massive mindshare, and yet it didn't have much of an impact on user behavior! What's probably going on is that these are ecosystems controlled by individual companies, which has a paradoxical effect: it means there's an economic incentive to provide excellent up-to-date documentation, but it also means that some knowledge is locked up inside organizations rather than being posted about on Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>Now consider another set of queries: the ones revolving around cloud hosting services like AWS, Azure, and GCP. In this case, what we see is that question volume is roughly flat year-over-year.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p><img src="https://www.thediff.co/content/images/2023/08/so_infra.png" alt="so_infra" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Two features set these apart:</p>
<ol>
<li>They're products with a fairly high launch cadence, whose offerings have materially changed since GPT-4's September 2021 knowledge cutoff. ChatGPT is great at answering "How do I do X?" questions, but if X was invented after the model was trained, it's flummoxed.</li>
<li>Infrastructure problems are often more situational. If writing a program is analogous to designing a plane, the infrastructure-related questions are a lot closer to asking how to repair an engine in mid-flight. It's harder to refactor something that's already running at scale, so many of the questions that arise will need more context, and perhaps more back-and-forth. (There's a somewhat similar split with questions about Git, because the two categories of questions are 1) I have no idea how to use this, and 2) I thought I knew how to use it but it's hopelessly broken.)</li>
</ol>
<p>And there is one other category that has helped Stack Overflow AI-proof itself: AI tools themselves!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.thediff.co/content/images/2023/08/so_ailibs.png" alt="so_ailibs" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>It's a delightful-but-temporary irony that the biggest thing Stack Overflow has a competitive advantage in is helping people build clones of the tools that are causing the site so much trouble in the first place. These products are new enough that there weren't many answers in the training data, or, in the case of Langchain, any answers whatsoever (it launched in October 2022, making it a colicky newborn of a library).</p>
<p>ChatGPT isn't just changing the way people ask questions about languages. It also seems to be changing the pace of adoption. One obstacle to switching platforms is that, in general, you know the one you're switching <em>from</em> better than you know the one you're switching <em>to</em>. The basic trade is to accept something like an 80% drop in productivity for a few months in exchange for, say, a 20% increase in productivity indefinitely thereafter. If new frameworks are faster to learn, and in particular if there's a trivial way to answer "How do I convert this code using library X to code using library Y instead," that switching process is accelerated. And even though this is happening in part because people are using ChatGPT rather than Stack Overflow, it shows up in the Stack Overflow data. Here's how the transition from Tensorflow to Pytorch is going:</p>

<p>Stack Overflow remains a great tool for knowledge creation and aggregation. It's unfortunate for the company that the single best way to search that priceless corpus of knowledge involves using someone else's service, probably paying them $20, and sending exactly $0 of that back to Stack Overflow. But it's hard to imagine Stack Overflow existing in the first place without being vulnerable to this: the site taps into what is, in pure dollar terms, one of the most valuable pools of human capital in existence. They knew that they weren't in a position to dictate terms to their users, and ensured that users were getting credit and could freely share the information they had. This has happened before: encyclopedias were a nice, slow-growth business for about a century. And then Microsoft licensed the contents of the Funk &amp; Wagnalls Encyclopedia, put them on CD-ROM with color illustrations, and started selling Encarta in 1993. And, soon after that, they realized that the near-zero marginal cost of CD-ROMs meant that computers could be pitched as educational, a nice bit of market segmentation that coincidentally obliterated the encyclopedia business' pricing power. And then the same problem happened to Microsoft, when Wikipedia supplanted Encarta.</p>
<p>It's just fundamentally hard to be in the business of selling information at a time when information aggregation and delivery mechanisms are somewhat hardware-bound and hardware keeps improving. This risk is generally invisible until it's unavoidable; generative AI spent a long time as a novelty product whose most useful product was <a href="https://twitter.com/jamieabrew/status/695060640931549184?ref=thediff.co">surreal humor</a>. And then suddenly, they could write code, and a few months after that, they could write code at a human level, faster than people could. (Though, as with the surrealist humor, it took some handholding and iteration to come up with the right prompts and edit things into good working order.) The company is <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/07/27/announcing-overflowai/?ref=thediff.co">launching its own AI tools</a>, mostly around search. Better search does help Q&amp;A sites directly, by making it more likely that someone will find the answer to the question they should have asked and less likely that they'll add a low-quality question that gets a rude answer in return. They're also making it easier to incorporate answers into the usual flow of work.</p>
<p>But they seem to be sticking with human-written text as the core offering. When someone's asking a question because they want to be in a position to independently produce the answer and to fully understand the principles behind it, a good Stack Overflow answer will beat what ChatGPT produces. But even though that's the most socially-valuable service Stack Overflow offers, it's not a good description of the typical user interaction, where the task at hand is less "I want to finally understand the Rust borrow checker" and more like "I want to fix this bug so I can finally log off." And LLMs are a better way to access Stack Overflow's knowledge base in order to provide that answer—it's visible right there in the data.</p>
<hr>
<p>The data analysis for this post would have taken much longer without Stack Exchange. And, if the site didn't exist, ChatGPT would have had a <em>lot</em> more trouble answering questions and providing code to build the web app you can use to interact with that data. Paying subscribers can access the tool that generated these charts, and generate their own charts of Stack Overflow trends.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Students aren't the main users of Stack Overflow, at least in my experience, but shifts in their participation will still show up on the chart even if the typical user is a full-time professional; the seasonality of the overall economy is the sum of non-overlapping seasons for other businesses: homebuying is stronger at the start of the year, travel and construction towards the middle, and retail in the fourth quarter. <a href="#fnref1">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn2"><p>This pattern also shows up at the individual level: when you first start studying a topic, you can passively absorb knowledge without necessarily having many questions; a good tutorial is probably one that answers every question it would raise for the typical reader, unless the question is deliberately left as an exercise. As you advance, you have enough knowledge to notice that things don't seem to make sense, or are done in counterintuitive ways. And then, once you've learned something really well, you have fewer questions about the topic as such and more about applications, intersections with other domains, etc. Often the difference between intermediate and expert skill at something is being able to answer a question with “Yes, that way would have made sense and if we were starting over we would have done it like that, but now we’re stuck with it.” <a href="#fnref2">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn3"><p>There's some kind of weird seasonal effect where search volume tends to drop in April relative to earlier in the year. The reasons for this are mysterious, but it repeats. <a href="#fnref3">↩︎</a></p>

<h3 id="the-other-x">The Other X</h3>
<p>Steel company Cleveland Cliffs has <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cleveland-cliffs-proposes-acquire-u-193200326.html?ref=thediff.co">made an offer to acquire US Steel at a 42% premium</a>. If this offer goes through, it will end US Steel's life as a public company, which started with a bang in 1901 when it was put together through the largest buyout ever and then taken public as the largest IPO ever, making it the first company with a $1bn enterprise value ($1.4bn, to be exact). It's underperformed a bit since then; the company's current enterprise value is $6.5bn.</p>
<p>The last few years have been an amazing cycle for the steel business; they've responded to mostly-low demand by curtailing investment, so when demand finally picked up during the post-Covid boom, earnings followed. One result of that is that steel companies are, optically, incredibly cheap; the offer still values the company at just 8.6x earnings, and that excludes any cost savings from a merger. (Which, in fairness, could be limited; the press release notes that the United Steelworkers have approved the deal, presumably because there aren't too many layoffs planned.) Of course, the cycle is a cycle, but even so, consensus estimates put the deal at 10.5x 2025's estimated earnings. One of the things that drives low long-term returns for cyclical businesses is that, when the cycle is good, it's easy to pencil out a plan for a merger where it's immediately accretive and the excess debt from the acquisition is paid down in just a few years. But that also means that a cyclical upswing has two simultaneous forces: companies use their excess cash to finally pay down debt (since the start of 2020, US Steel has reduced its net debt from $3.6bn to $1.3bn). Meanwhile, low leverage and high earnings make companies a tempting target for acquirers, so their financial leverage can end up rising right when operating leverage starts cutting in the wrong direction.</p>
<h3 id="refinancing-china">Refinancing China</h3>
<p>Last year, <em>The Diff</em> <a href="https://www.thediff.co/archive/how-to-make-another-reserve-currency/">noted two problems with China trying to create a reserve currency</a>: there's a shortage of renminbi-denominated risk-free assets, and there's far too much off-balance-sheet debt issued by entities associated with lower-level governments. The post proposed that China could centralize some of this debt, issuing bonds on behalf of the central government in order to pay off province-level borrowing (a negotiation that would presumably involve some transfer of decision-making ability in the other direction). China isn't doing that, exactly, but <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-11/china-to-shift-139-billion-of-troubled-lgfv-debt-to-provinces?ref=thediff.co">is pushing provinces to raise $139bn in order to pay off local debt</a>. One function this serves is to move debt onto the balance sheet, which means it makes China's financial system more legible to outsiders—but also means that insiders get to see which local governments achieved their growth targets through good management and which ones just borrowed their way to success.</p>
<h3 id="the-activist-short-death-spiral">The Activist Short Death Spiral</h3>
<p>In January, short seller Hindenburg Research issued a negative report on the Adani complex of companies. That's cost the companies some market value, but hasn't led to a full-blown crisis just yet. But the crisis is getting closer: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5b0cafdb-52ec-404e-9efc-a9630acc9315?ref=thediff.co">Adani's auditor, Deloitte, has resigned, saying it can't properly understand certain inter-group transactions</a> ($, <em>FT</em>). This is sometimes the way large, complex, levered entities die: once skepticism gets expressed, it becomes riskier to deal with them; even if the auditors believe that the odds of fraud are only, say, 5%, that makes it a poor risk-reward to audit them. And a second auditor has less information than the first, and thus a wider confidence interval for what Deloitte thought the odds were. Meanwhile, lenders will <em>also</em> rethink their loans—any given lender might be confident that the company is fine, but also might worry that if other lenders don't think so, and might decline to roll over their loans accordingly. Just as many companies, from coffee shops to phone designers, eventually evolve into banks, some companies continuously add complexity until they're vulnerable to a bank run.</p>
<h3 id="rebundling">Rebundling</h3>
<p>Some of the large-but-not-largest streaming companies, including Paramount and Warner Bros. Discover, have <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/08/streaming-bundle-future.html?ref=thediff.co">mused publicly about bundling with other companies' streaming offerings</a>. One of the surprises about the streaming business is that even though it's existence for over a decade and a half, we're still learning about how the economics actually work. Part of that is because the streaming bundle exists in the context of other bundles whose economics are more mature, meaning that certain IP libraries were late or intermittent to streaming and that some of the industry's structure was determined by the cohort of determined contrarians who made streaming work in the first place. (They were right about trends in home broadband and in customer expectations for on-demand entertainment, but turned out to be wrong so far about whether or not ads worked.) That legacy creates legal and economic friction around the streaming business, so companies are still iterating.</p>
<h3 id="fitness-bands">Fitness Bands</h3>
<p><em>The Verge</em> has a story in an undersupplied category: products that used to be popular and slowly faded away. In this case, they're writing about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23820207/fitness-bands-less-popular-wearables-smartwatches?ref=thediff.co">where all the fitness bands went</a>. It's a classic durables story: for a while, the products kept getting cheaper and better, which meant that every seller had an incentive to clear out their inventory as quickly as possible. Past a certain point, sensors were so cheap that fitness bands could be an app in a more general-purpose smartwatch, and it was easier for Apple to incorporate the relevant subset of Fitbit than for Fitbit to somehow recreate the whole Apple ecosystem. The other option was subscription, but even there it's difficult to get the economics exactly right (though Apple is, naturally, trying): every subscription fitness product wants people to keep all of their fitness in one ecosystem, but that either means lots of integrations across different platforms that may have the same incentive for lock-in, or requiring customers to do a lot of data entry in order to use the product.</p>

    <p>If carcinization happens when languages evolve to be more like Rust, then what do you call
it when Rust evolves to be more like Java? Caffeination?</p>









<p>Over this summer, I’ve had a decent amount of time to kill.
What better way to spend a beautiful hot summer than sitting inside, staring at core dumps in a
supposedly memory-safe language?
I built a garbage collector - in short, a piece of software that manages allocations for another,
more exciting piece of software.
The cool part: I made it in Rust, for Rust - a language designed to eliminate garbage
collection and which provides few facilities for making it work properly.
Not only that, I managed to make my garbage collector work with relatively few compromises, which
I’ll describe in further detail lower down.</p>

<p>If you don’t like reading, don’t care about the journey to implement it, or just want to get a
sales pitch for the final result, check out the source code on GitHub
<a href="https://github.com/claytonwramsey/dumpster">here</a>.
You can also download it directly from <a href="https://crates.io/crates/dumpster">crates.io</a>.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>If you’re familiar with the details of Rust and its standard library, feel free to skip this
section.</p>

<p>The core backing behind Rust’s memory model is <em>affine typing</em> and the <em>borrow checker</em>.
Values may only be bound to one identifier at a time, and borrows (a.k.a. references) may not
outlive the scope binding their referent.</p>

<p>For example, the following code is invalid:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>];</span>
<span>let</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{x:?}"</span><span>);</span> <span>// compile error - x has already been moved</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Normally, we work around this by borrowing against a binding, such as by making <code>y = &amp;x</code> in the
example above.
However, we often need to share some heap-allocated value without knowing which binding will live
the longest.
The solution to this problem is shared ownership via garbage collection.</p>

<p>Rust’s standard library offers two simple reference-counted garbage collectors: the single-threaded
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/index.html"><code>Rc</code></a> and its atomically-indexed counterpart
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code>Arc</code></a>.
They operate by maintaining a reference count in each heap allocation.
Under most circumstances, these work great, but they can’t handle cyclic references.
Combined with interior mutability, it’s trivial to refute them.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::{</span><span>cell</span><span>::</span><span>OnceCell</span><span>,</span> <span>rc</span><span>::</span><span>Rc</span><span>};</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span><span>(</span><span>OnceCell</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Rc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Foo</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>);</span>

<span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>Rc</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>Foo</span><span>(</span><span>OnceCell</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>()));</span>
<span>x</span><span>.0</span><span>.set</span><span>(</span><span>Rc</span><span>::</span><span>clone</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>));</span>
<span>// My foo has a reference to itself. It can never be freed!</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is why people actually get paid money to build garbage collectors.
If using a reference counter were all you needed, a number of people working at Oracle would be out
of a job.</p>

<h2 id="battle-plan">Battle plan</h2>

<p>We’d like to create some <code>Gc</code> data structure with a similar API to <code>Rc</code> and <code>Arc</code>, which can accept
nearly any data type contained within, and still manage to detect and collect cycles.</p>

<p>We have a few weapons at our disposal:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code>Drop</code></strong>: Every non-copiable data type in Rust can implement the <code>Drop</code> trait to ensure some
code is called every time it is dropped.
In our case, we can implement <code>Drop</code> for <code>Gc</code> to try to glean some knowledge about when an
allocation becomes inaccessible.</li>
  <li><strong>Traits</strong>: We can construct some trait (in our case, let’s call it <code>Collectable</code>) as a mandatory
requirement to be contained in a <code>Gc</code>.
Creating this trait has some major downsides (libraries upstream of <code>dumpster</code> can’t implement it)
but it’s a necessary evil.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, our formidable tools are matched by equally formidable challenges:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Undetectable moves</strong>. When a value is moved in Rust, there is no way to detect that fact from
within that value.
If we had some sort of trait like <code>OnMove</code> which could allow for a function to be called every
time it had moved, we could use it to detect when a <code>Gc</code> moved inside another <code>Gc</code>, making it
unrooted, and allowing us to create a simple mark-sweep collector.
At this rate, though, we would just reinvent C++’s copy constructors.</li>
  <li><strong>Variable-sized data</strong>. I foolishly decided to make it so that <code>Gc</code> could store <code>?Sized</code> types,
which is more flexible for library users (enabling things like <code>Gc&lt;[T]&gt;</code>).</li>
  <li><strong>Type erasure</strong>. In a typical Rust program, generics are implemented via monomorphization, and
no type information is retained at runtime.
This makes it harder to clean up an allocation without prior context.</li>
</ul>

<p>With these two, relatively simple tools, we have enough to build a collector which can handle just
about any data type inside.</p>

<h2 id="my-approach">My approach</h2>

<p>We need to detect whether a <code>Gc</code> is reachable without actually scanning the stack.
I’ll start with a few definitions, using graph-theoretical language.</p>

<ol>
  <li>An allocation graph \(G = (V, E, r)\) is a directed graph with a root node \(r \in V\) whose
indegree is zero.</li>
  <li>A node \(v\) in an allocation graph is said to be <em>accessible</em> if and only if there exists a
path from \(r\) to \(v\) in the graph.</li>
</ol>

<p>It should be clear to see why these definitions are useful to us.
We can imagine each node being one allocation, pretending that all data not indirected through a
<code>Gc</code> is part of an imaginary allocation for the root.
Additionally, each <code>Gc</code> acts as an edge connecting two allocations.
If an allocation is accessible in the graph-theoretical sense, it’s still possible for a program to
reach it, and if not, it’s safe to free that allocation.
Note that the indegree of a node is precisely equal to the reference count of its corresponding
allocation.</p>

<p>I’ll roughly outline our approach to determining whether some node \(n: \neq r\) is accessible.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find \(W\), the set of all descendants of \(n\).
Construct the subgraph \(H\) of \(G\) whose vertex set is \(W\), preserving all edges
connecting nodes in \(W\).</li>
  <li>Find the set of nodes \(A \subseteq W\) for which the indegree of each \(a \in A\) in \(H\)
is <em>not</em> equal to its indegree in \(G\).</li>
  <li>For each \(a \in A\), mark it and its descendants as accessible.</li>
  <li>If and only if \(n\) was marked as accessible, it is accessible.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s a serpentine implementation in pseudocode, if that’s what you prefer.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>is_accessible</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>):</span>
    <span>counts</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>n</span><span>:</span> <span>n</span><span>.</span><span>indegree</span><span>()}</span>

            <span>dfs</span><span>(</span><span>m</span><span>,</span> <span>counts</span><span>)</span>

    <span>counts</span><span>[</span><span>n</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>1</span>


<span>def</span> <span>mark</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>reachable</span><span>):</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>a</span> <span>not</span> <span>in</span> <span>reachable</span><span>:</span>

            <span>mark</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>reachable</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It should be pretty clear to see that <code>is_accessible</code> runs in \(O(|V| + |E|)\) time.</p>



<p>Our single-threaded <code>Gc</code> will behave much like an <code>Rc</code>, but with some minor details changed.</p>

<p>First, we define a <code>Gc</code> and the allocation it points to, a <code>GcBox</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Gc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>?</span><span>Sized</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>ptr</span><span>:</span> <span>NonNull</span><span>&lt;</span><span>GcBox</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>#[repr(C)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>GcBox</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>?</span><span>Sized</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>ref_count</span><span>:</span> <span>Cell</span><span>&lt;</span><span>usize</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

</code></pre></div>

<p>I, being very clever, decided to use a sentinel value of 0 for the reference count when an
allocation is being cleaned up (to prevent spurious double-frees).</p>

<p>However, this code has a problem - how the hell are we supposed to implement <code>is_accessible</code>?</p>

<h3 id="trait-hackery">Trait hackery</h3>

<p>Our pseudocode for <code>is_accessible</code> required us to be able to access the set of edges going out from
a node.
Doing so is kind of hard.
If we were writing this in C, we would scan the allocation on the heap, looking for data that
looked like they could be pointers into other allocations.
In Rust, though, we can be a lot more precise by adding a small constraint to every
garbage-collected type.</p>

<p>If the garbage collector wasn’t enough, we’re bringing the visitor pattern over from Java.
We force every garbage-collected value to implement the <code>Collectable</code> trait, which will delegate
some <code>Visitor</code> to each of its garbage-collected fields.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Gc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Collectable</span> <span>+</span> <span>?</span><span>Sized</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>// same as before ...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>Collectable</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>accept</span><span>&lt;</span><span>V</span><span>:</span> <span>Visitor</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>visitor</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>V</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>Visitor</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>visit_gc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Collectable</span> <span>+</span> <span>?</span><span>Sized</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>gc</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>Gc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>For example, an array might implement it by delegating to <code>accept</code> on each of its elements.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Collectable</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Collectable</span> <span>for</span> <span>[</span><span>T</span><span>]</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>accept</span><span>&lt;</span><span>V</span><span>:</span> <span>Visitor</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>visitor</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>V</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.iter</span><span>()</span><span>.for_each</span><span>(|</span><span>elem</span><span>|</span> <span>elem</span><span>.accept</span><span>(</span><span>visitor</span><span>));</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can now write code that finds the outgoing edges from each allocation by simply applying a
visitor to the allocation.
I ended up writing two visitors - one for the <code>dfs</code> step and one for the <code>mark</code> step.</p>

<p>I would have liked to make <code>Collectable</code> object-safe, but that would also require <code>Visitor</code> to be
object safe.
That, in turn, would cause every garbage collector to be coercible to <code>Gc&lt;dyn Collectable&gt;</code>, which
would only be possible on nightly, making it impossible to write a stable crate.</p>

<h3 id="bulk-dropping">Bulk dropping</h3>

<p>A cursory analysis of the implementation of <code>Drop</code> above shows that the call to <code>is_accessible</code> runs
in linear time with respect to the total number of <code>Gc</code>s existing.
You would be excused for thinking that <code>drop</code>, as written, runs in linear time.
However, the call to <code>drop_in_place</code> could also result in another <code>Gc</code> being dropped, yielding
a quadratic-time cleanup.
This is unacceptable, especially since our first call to <code>is_accessible</code> actually did all the work
of determining whether the allocations are reachable from the original one - if the original
allocation being freed was inaccessible, any allocation referred to by it should also be
inaccessible.</p>

<p>We can save our time on marking by a pretty simple method: we’ll do one more pass through the
reference graph, recording a pointer to each allocation to be destroyed and its implementation of
<code>drop</code>. Then, once we’ve found every inaccessible allocation, we’ll drop them all in one quick go.</p>

<p>There’s one final problem, though: each <code>Gc</code> owned by a dropped value could itself try to manipulate
the reference counts of its pointees, resulting in undefined behavior, or worse, slow code.
However, all problems in computer science can be solved by adding more state or more indirection.
We opt to solve it with extra state this time, creating a thread-local value called <code>COLLECTING</code>.</p>

<p>When we do a bulk-drop, we set <code>COLLECTING</code> to <code>true</code>.
Then, when we call <code>drop</code> on a <code>Gc</code>, it checks the state of <code>COLLECTING</code>.
If <code>COLLECTING</code> is true, the <code>Gc</code> does nothing when dropped (not even affecting its reference
count).
To handle outbound edges to still-accessible allocations, we add one more traversal before the final
cleanup to handle outbound edges.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at what the code for that roughly looks like now.</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p><code>collect</code> is the function we’ll write to check if the allocation is accessible and perform a bulk
cleanup if needed.
There’s one more problem before we can implement <code>collect</code>, though: our psuedocode required us to be
able to store each allocation as a key in <code>counts</code> and also to access the allocation’s neighbors.
This means we have to use a little bit of type erasure to achieve our ends.
I won’t go into too much detail, but we need to be able to do two things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Store pointers to allocations as keys in a hash-map.</li>
  <li>Reconstruct a stored pointer using type information to make it possible to do work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to the limitations of Rust, these are actually mutually exclusive.
Because it’s undefined behavior (due to provenance issues) to compare the raw data in pointers, we
can’t erase a pointer and then use it as a key in a hash-map.
However, we can’t just get a pointer to the first byte of the allocation, because our allocation
could be <code>?Sized</code>.</p>

<p>As a result, my implementation actually has two different kinds of erased pointers: a thin pointer
which can be used for comparisons and a fat pointer which can be used to reconstruct a pointer to
any type.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>AllocationId</span><span>(</span><span>NonNull</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Cell</span><span>&lt;</span><span>usize</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>);</span> <span>// used as a key in hash-maps</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>ErasedPtr</span><span>([</span><span>usize</span><span>;</span> <span>2</span><span>]);</span>              <span>// used as a reconstructible pointer to the allocation</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then, all the functions which need to know the type information of the allocation (such as <code>dfs</code> and
<code>mark</code>) can be stored opaquely as function pointers, and when called, they can “rehydrate” the
<code>ErasedPtr</code> passed in with type information.</p>

<p>Below, I’ve included an example of how it can be used to implement <code>dfs</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>dfs</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Collectable</span> <span>+</span> <span>?</span><span>Sized</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>I won’t include the implementation of <code>collect</code> here because it’s lengthy and not even the
final revision of the cleanup algorithm, but you can trust me that it works.
After much gnashing of teeth and tearing of hair, this is finally enough to achieve bulk dropping,
making calling <code>drop()</code> on a <code>Gc</code> a linear-time operation.</p>

<h3 id="amortizing">Amortizing</h3>

<p>What’s that, you say?
You need your reference operations to work in \(O(1)\) time?
Why are programmers these days so picky?</p>

<p>Luckily, it isn’t too hard to make our garbage-collection efforts terminate in average-case
\(O(1)\) time.
Instead of calling <code>collect</code> directly, we’ll just punt the allocation, which may be inaccessible,
into a set of “dirty” allocations.
In my code, I call that set a dumpster.
Then, once every \(|E|\) times an allocation is dropped, we’ll go through the whole dumpster and
collect them all in \(O(|E|)\) time.
Amortized across all allocations, that’s technically \(O(1)\), enabled by the same accounting
wizardry that makes array-backed lists useful and that caused the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

<p>To save ourselves a little bit of work, whenever an allocation is accessed (such as by dereferencing
or cloning), we can yank the allocation away from that same dirty set since it was just proven to be
accessible.</p>

<h2 id="are-we-concurrent-yet">Are we concurrent yet?</h2>

<p>So far, the garbage collector I’ve been outlining to you has been a single-threaded collector, which
can only store thread-local garbage-collected values.
I’m told that all code worth writing ends up being concurrent, so we have to do better than that.
Lucky for us, this algorithm can be made to operate concurrently with little effort, assuming that
only one thread collects at a time.</p>

<p>However, even if only one thread is collecting, we can still run into some nasty concurrency issues.
Let’s imagine that we have 2 allocations, \(a\) and \(b\), plus the imaginary “root” allocation
\(r\), where \(a\) can only be accessed from \(r\) and \(b\) can only be accessed from
\(a\).</p>

<pre><code>flowchart LR
  r("r")

  a --&gt; b
  r --&gt; a
</code></pre>

<p>Now, consider performing a depth-first search starting from \(a\).
First, we record that \(a\) has 1 unaccounted-for-reference in <code>counts</code>.
Then, we move on to looking at \(b\) because it’s one of \(a\)’s children.</p>

<p>However, between when we record \(a\)’s reference count and examine \(b\), another malicious
thread mutates \(b\), adding a back-reference from \(b\) to \(a\).</p>

<pre><code>flowchart LR
  r("r")

  a --&gt; b
  b --&gt; a
  r --&gt; a
</code></pre>

<p>Then, the depth-first search will return to \(a\), decrement the number of unaccounted references,
and assume that all incoming references to \(a\) and \(b\) were totally accounted for (and
therefore inaccessible).
Then the garbage collector would happily destroy \(a\) and \(b\)’s allocations, leaving a
dangling reference to the heap, potentially causing a use-after-free or other gnarly memory errors.</p>

<h3 id="resolving-concurrency">Resolving concurrency</h3>

<p>The simplest solution to this concurrency issue is to just wrap everything in a big fat lock by
forcing every single operation involving a <code>Gc</code> to acquire a single global mutex, preventing any
sort of concurrency bugs at all.
However, that’s ridiculously slow.</p>

<p>We’d like to have an approach that only needs to achieve mutual exclusion over a small subset of
all allocations if at all possible.
To do so, let’s take a closer look at our concurrency problem: we can see that we only really get
erroneous results when another thread mutates the subgraph \(H\) as we interact with it.
The solution is quite clever - we tag every <code>Gc</code> with a special number, which I’ll call a collecting
tag.</p>

<p>First, we’ll add a global atomic integer called the <code>COLLECTING_TAG</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>COLLECTING_TAG</span><span>:</span> <span>AtomicUsize</span> <span>=</span> <span>AtomicUsize</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Whenever we create or clone a new <code>Gc</code>, we’ll annotate it with the current value of
<code>COLLECTING_TAG</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// this new `Gc` type is intended to be `Sync`.</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Gc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Collectable</span> <span>+</span> <span>Send</span> <span>+</span> <span>Sync</span> <span>+</span> <span>?</span><span>Sized</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Collectable</span> <span>+</span> <span>Send</span> <span>+</span> <span>Sync</span> <span>+</span> <span>?</span><span>Sized</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Gc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>new</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Gc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// (other bookkeeping hidden)</span>

        <span>Gc</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>ptr</span><span>:</span> <span>/* initialization of GcBox&lt;T&gt; */</span><span>,</span>
            <span>tag</span><span>:</span> <span>COLLECTING_TAG</span><span>.load</span><span>(</span><span>Ordering</span><span>::</span><span>Relaxed</span><span>),</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, at the start of the collection process, we’ll increment the value of <code>COLLECTING_TAG</code> just
before we call <code>dfs</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>collect</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>COLLECTING_TAG</span><span>.fetch_add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>Ordering</span><span>::</span><span>Relaxed</span><span>);</span>
    <span>// carry on with DFS and such</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Lastly, whenever we encounter a <code>Gc</code> during the <code>dfs</code> process, we’ll check its tag.
If the tag is equal to the current value of <code>COLLECTING_TAG</code>, that means the <code>Gc</code> was created after
<code>dfs</code> started.
If so, then whatever spot we found the <code>Gc</code> in must have been accessible, and we can mark it as so.
To prevent us from visiting the same edge twice (due to shenanigans), we’ll also update the tag
on every edge we visit to the value of <code>COLLECTING_TAG</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s return to our broken example to show how this modification fixes it.
We return to our reference graph with \(a\) pointing to \(b\) and \(r\) pointing to \(a\).
Since every <code>Gc</code> must be annotated with a tag, let’s say they’re all tagged with 0.</p>

<pre><code>graph LR
  r("r")

  r -- "0" --&gt; a
  a -- "0" --&gt; b
</code></pre>

<p>Next, when <code>dfs</code> begins, <code>COLLECTING_TAG</code> is incremented to 1.
As a result, the new reference created by a malicious thread must be tagged with 1.</p>

<pre><code>graph LR
   r("r")
   r -- "0" --&gt; a
   a -- "0" --&gt; b
   b -- "1" --&gt; a
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when <code>dfs</code> visits the edge pointing from \(b\) to \(a\), it sees that the reference is
labeled with a tag of 1, and therefore both \(b\) and \(a\) must be accessible - no accidental
early deallocations here.</p>

<h3 id="moving-in-and-out">Moving in and out</h3>

<p>We might hope that tagging the pointers is sufficient to prevent all concurrency bugs.
However, this is sadly not enough.
To show why, we’ll begin with an example.</p>

<p>First, let’s imagine an allocation called \(x\), which contains two optional references to itself.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>X</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x1</span><span>:</span> <span>Mutex</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Gc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>X</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>x2</span><span>:</span> <span>Mutex</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Gc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>X</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<p>At the start of our example, there will be only one <code>Gc</code> pointing from inside \(x\) to itself, and
the other slot that can hold a <code>Gc</code> will be empty.
\(x\) is accessible directly from the root allocation \(r\), and all existing references are
tagged with 0.
For the sake of clarity, I’ll draw the arrow representing the first slot in \(x\) with a solid
line and the second slot with a dashed line.</p>

<p>This problem stumped me for a decent while.
It seems impossible to prevent other threads from do-si-do-ing every <code>Gc</code> pointing to an allocation
in order to fool our search.
Luckily, there is a way through.
Since tagging every <code>Gc</code> worked out for us before, we’ll try tagging every allocation.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#[repr(C)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>GcBox</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Collectable</span> <span>+</span> <span>Send</span> <span>+</span> <span>Sync</span> <span>+</span> <span>?</span><span>Sized</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, every time a <code>Gc</code> is dereferenced, we’ll update the tag in the allocation to the current
value of <code>COLLECTING_TAG</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Collectable</span> <span>+</span> <span>Send</span> <span>+</span> <span>Sync</span> <span>+</span> <span>?</span><span>Sized</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>ops</span><span>::</span><span>Deref</span> <span>for</span> <span>GcBox</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Whenever <code>dfs</code> observes that the tag on an allocation is equal to <code>COLLECTING_TAG</code>, that means that
the allocation was accessed, and therefore accessible.
In order to shuffle references around in our above example, the malicious thread would have to
dereference a <code>Gc</code>, notifying the search and preventing an early deallocation.</p>

<p>In fact, this is enough to prove that <code>dfs</code> will <em>never</em> incorrectly mark an allocation as
inaccessible, even under concurrent execution.
This blog post is already rather long, so I’ll only provide a rough sketch of the proof.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem: <code>dfs</code> will never erroneously mark an allocation as inaccessible.</strong></p>

<p>Proof:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If <code>dfs</code> encounters a <code>Gc</code> created after <code>dfs</code> begins, it will know that the referent is
accessible.</li>
  <li>Due to (1), if <code>dfs</code> marked some allocation \(a\) as inaccessible, it must have only visited
<code>Gc</code>s pointing to \(a\) which existed before <code>dfs</code> began.</li>
  <li>Weakening the statement from (2), if <code>dfs</code> marked some allocation \(a\) as inaccessible, it
must have only visited <code>Gc</code>s pointing to \(a\) which existed when \(a\)’s reference count was
recorded.</li>
  <li><code>dfs</code> never visits a <code>Gc</code> while it points from the root allocation \(r\) to any other
allocation.</li>
  <li><code>dfs</code> must visit every <code>Gc</code> which pointed to an allocation at the point when its reference count
was recorded in order to mark it as inaccessible.</li>
  <li>Due to (4) and (5), if \(a\) is marked as inaccesssible, any <code>Gc</code> which at any point connected
\(r\) to \(a\) must have been moved to connect another node (not \(r\)) to \(a\).</li>
  <li>Due to (6), there is no lifetime <code>'x</code> which can borrow against a <code>Gc</code> pointing from \(r\) to
\(a\) and last between when <code>dfs</code> first visits \(a\) and when it last visits \(a\).</li>
  <li>The final <code>Gc</code> to move into \(a\) before <code>dfs</code> must have been moved while another borrow
against a <code>Gc</code> pointing from \(r\) to \(a\) existed.
Let the lifetime of that borrow be <code>'y</code>.</li>
  <li>Because <code>'y</code> lasts longer than the final move, <code>'y</code> can be extended to last arbitrarily long,
even until after <code>dfs</code> has finished visiting every <code>Gc</code> pointing to \(a\).</li>
  <li>Due to (7), <code>'y</code> must not have existed before <code>dfs</code> first visited \(a\).
Therefore, if \(a\) is erroneously marked as inaccessible, a <code>Gc</code> pointing to \(a\) must have
been dereferenced to generate a borrow with lifetime <code>'y</code>.</li>
  <li>If a <code>Gc</code> pointing to \(a\) was dereferenced before the last time <code>dfs</code> visited a <code>Gc</code> pointing
to \(a\), then <code>dfs</code> would have observed that \(a\)’s tag had changed.
Therefore, if an allocation was erroneously marked as inaccessible, it must have been marked as
accessible.
Therefore no allocations were ever erroneously marked as inacessible by <code>dfs</code>.
QED.</li>
</ol>

<p>This proof is relatively handwavy, but it should be possible for an astute reader to fill in the
details.
I will leave it to such astute readers to prove the complementary proof to this; namely, that <code>dfs</code>
will never erroneously mark an allocation as accessible.</p>

<p>I also think that it’s really cool that the entire mechanism of the correctness of this approach is
totally supported by Rust’s borrow checking semantics.
It makes the whole thing feel like it fits right in.</p>

<h3 id="its-the-weak-ones-that-count">It’s the weak ones that count</h3>

<p>There’s one more cause for memory safety issues from concurrency.
If an allocation is freed because its reference count reached zero, it could still be accessible
by another thread because it was stored in the global dumpster.
We can’t guarantee that we’ve obliterated all references to that allocation from every other
thread’s memory, so it seems like we’re hosed.</p>

<p>However, there’s no problem in computer science that can’t be solved by adding more state.
Taking a leaf from <code>Rc</code>’s book and adapting it liberally, we annotate each allocation with a “weak”
reference count, which is the number of times it’s referenced by a dumpster or cleanup thread.
We’ll rename our original reference count to be the strong count instead.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#[repr(C)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>GcBox</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Collectable</span> <span>+</span> <span>Send</span> <span>+</span> <span>Sync</span> <span>+</span> <span>?</span><span>Sized</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>strong</span><span>:</span> <span>AtomicUsize</span><span>,</span>
    <span>weak</span><span>:</span> <span>AtomicUsize</span><span>,</span>
    <span>tag</span><span>:</span> <span>AtomicUsize</span><span>,</span>
    <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then, when dropping the last strong reference to a <code>Gc</code>, we first check that its weak reference
count is nonzero before we can deallocate it.
If not, it’s the cleanup threads’ problem to take care of it.</p>

<p>Whenever an allocation is removed from a dumpster and about to be thrown away by a thread running
a cleanup procedure, the thread decrements the weak count of the allocation and checks if both the
weak and strong count have reached zero.
If so, that thread can then safely destroy the allocation.</p>

<h3 id="deadlocked">Deadlocked!</h3>

<p>Imagine that we want to create a <code>Gc&lt;Mutex&lt;()&gt;&gt;</code>, and then drop a <code>Gc</code> pointing to it while the
<code>Mutex</code> is locked.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>gc1</span> <span>=</span> <span>Gc</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>Mutex</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(()));</span>
<span>let</span> <span>gc2</span> <span>=</span> <span>gc1</span><span>.clone</span><span>();</span>

<span>let</span> <span>guard</span> <span>=</span> <span>gc1</span><span>.lock</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
<span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>gc2</span><span>);</span> <span>// suppose this triggers a cleanup</span>
<span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>guard</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>While traversing the reference graph, the <code>dfs</code> visitor would attempt to visit the mutex, lock it,
and try to carry on.
However, since the same thread that triggered the allocation still holds a guard to that mutex, the
thread would deadlock disastrously.
Lucky for us, we know that any allocation with a held mutex guard must still be accessible (due to
<code>Mutex</code>’s excellent API), so we can be certain that if we fail to acquire a mutex, we have immediate
proof that an allocation is accessible.</p>

<p>To take advantage of that, we’ll make visiting a collectable type a fallible operation, and make it
so that failing to acquire a lock also fails the visit.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>Collectable</span> <span>{</span>

<h3 id="sharing-your-dumpsters">Sharing your dumpsters</h3>

<p><img src="https://claytonwramsey.github.io/assets/img/dumpster/garbagetruck.jpg" alt="
    A hand-drawn garbage truck in ink on a white background.
    It's crudely done, as if drawn by the sort of person who knows what perspective is but doesn't
    quite understand how it works.
"></p>

<p>You’ve made it this far into this (admittedly rather lengthy) post.
Enjoy this hand-drawn picture by yours truly.</p>

<p>When implementing this garbage collector, one of the biggest bottlenecks with concurrent performance
is accessing the one, global dumpster every single time a <code>Gc</code> is dropped.
If using a <code>Mutex&lt;HashMap&gt;</code>, this will remove nearly all parallelism from the whole system and
make you wonder why you paid all that money for a 16-core computer.</p>

<p>As a result, any sane person might lean for a concurrent hashmap.
There are many Rust implementations - I tried
<a href="https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/chashmap"><code>chashmap</code></a> but gave up on it due to a
<a href="https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/chashmap/-/issues/3">rare panic bug</a>, and then I tried
<a href="https://github.com/xacrimon/dashmap"><code>dashmap</code></a>, which worked fine but was too slow as thread
counts increased.</p>

<p>The heart of the issue is that concurrently updating any data structure is going to be slow.
Even so-called “concurrent” data structures which use clever sharded locks have this issue - there’s
always some contention overhead.
The best workaround to concurrency slowdowns is to just not do things concurrently.
We can fix this by making every thread have its own dumpster, and then having a global collection
of to-be-cleaned allocations which I’ll call the <em>garbage truck</em>.
Whenever another allocation is marked dirty, we can check if this thread’s dumpster is full
according to some heuristic, and if so, transfer all the allocations from this thread’s dumpster
to the garbage truck.
I’ve included some pseudocode for the whole process below.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>dumpster</span> <span>=</span> <span>set</span><span>()</span> <span># local to this thread
</span><span>garbage_truck</span> <span>=</span> <span>mutex</span><span>(</span><span>set</span><span>())</span> <span># global to all threads
</span>
<span>def</span> <span>mark_dirty</span><span>(</span><span>allocation</span><span>):</span>
    <span>dumpster</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>allocation</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>is_full</span><span>(</span><span>dumpster</span><span>):</span>
        <span>garbage_truck</span><span>.</span><span>lock</span><span>()</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>trash_bag</span> <span>in</span> <span>dumpster</span><span>:</span>
            <span>garbage_truck</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>trash_bag</span><span>)</span>
        <span>garbage_truck</span><span>.</span><span>unlock</span><span>()</span>
        <span>dumpster</span> <span>=</span> <span>set</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If <code>is_full</code> returns <code>true</code> rarely enough, there will be almost no contention over the garbage
truck.
This means that the concurrency overhead is vastly reduced and we get to pocket some great
performance returns.</p>

<h2 id="okay-but-how-fast-is-it">Okay, but how fast is it?</h2>

<p>In short, this garbage collector runs pretty fast!</p>

<p>In the end, I made two different garbage collector implementations - one which is thread-local,
saving us from all the concurrency headaches, and another thread-safe one that has all the bells and
whistles at the cost of some performance.
Borrowing from <a href="https://github.com/matklad/once_cell"><code>once_cell</code></a>’s API, the former lives in the
<code>unsync</code> module of the crate and the latter in <code>sync</code>.</p>

<p>Next, I collected all the garbage collectors I could find in order to compare them.
I selected all the ones which had a similar API to <code>dumpster</code>, were published on
<a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, and actually worked.</p>

<p>I excluded the ones that didn’t have a <code>dumpster</code>-like API because it would have been a pain to set
up a benchmarking harness to handle them.
If you feel this is poor diligence, you can go benchmark them yourself.
I also included <code>Rc</code> and <code>Arc</code>, even though they don’t collect cycles, because they’re a decent
baseline for the minimum performance of a garbage collector.
During my research, I also found that <code>bacon-rajan-cc</code> doesn’t initiate collections of its own
accord, so I added a version of each of <code>dumpster</code>’s garbage collectors which doesn’t automatically
trigger collections in the spirit of competitive fairness.
Those versions are labeled as “manual.”
Lastly, I found that <code>gcmodule</code> simply stack-overflows and sometimes segfaults when facing extremely
large collection loads, so I removed it from the benchmark set.</p>

<p>As my benchmark, I decided to do the very simplest thing I could think of: have a bunch of
allocations randomly add and remove references to each other in a loop, dropping and creating new
allocations as well.
To account for random noise, I ran 100 trials of each garbage collector doing 1 million operations.
Each operation is either the creation of a reference or a deletion.</p>

<p>First, I ran a benchmark of all the garbage collectors, measuring pure single-threaded performance.
I’ve shown my benchmark results as a set of violin plots below, relating runtime to frequency.</p>

<p><img src="https://claytonwramsey.github.io/assets/img/dumpster/single_threaded.png" alt="
    A violin plot, titled &quot;Single-threaded GC comparison.&quot;
    The x-axis is labeled &quot;Runtime for 1M ops (ms),&quot; and the y-axis is labeled &quot;Garbage collector,&quot;
    with various collectors labeled on the ticks.
    In order, the garbage collectors on the y-axis are Arc, Rc, shredder, bacon-rajan-cc, gc,
    dumpster (sync/manual), dumpster (sync), dumpster (unsync/manual), and dumpster (unsync).
    The x-axis ranges from 0 ms to 4000 ms. All of the violins, except for shredder's, are very near
    to the left side.
    The violin labeled &quot;shredder&quot; is far off to the right side, with a mean of roughly 3700ms.
"></p>

<p>This plot doesn’t tell us much other than that <code>shredder</code> is slow.
To take a closer look, let’s remove <code>shredder</code> from the list and see what we find.</p>

<p><img src="https://claytonwramsey.github.io/assets/img/dumpster/single_threaded_sans_shredder.png" alt="
    The same violin plot as before, but now shredder's violin and y-axis label have been removed.
    The x-axis now varies from 40 to 160 ms.
    The violin labeled Rc is furthest to the left, followed by Arc, bacon-rajan-cc, dumpster
    (unsync), dumpster (unsync/manual), dumpster (sync/manual), gc, and finally dumpster (sync).
"></p>

<p><code>dumpster</code>’s unsync implementation is in a decent position, beat out only by the non-cycle-detecting
allocators and <code>bacon-rajan-cc</code>.
<code>bacon-rajan-cc</code> has very little overhead and is quite performant.</p>

<p>I think there are two main reasons why the concurrent version of the garbage collector is much
slower than the single-threaded one.
First, moving allocations from a thread-local dumpster to the global garbage truck takes some time.
Second, the <code>dfs</code> operation in a concurrent environment must record the current set of children of
an allocation, typically in a separate heap-allocated structure, to prevent some concurrency bugs.
It’s certainly possible to mitigate the losses from the first issue, but the second is harder to
handle.</p>

<p>My guess as to why the concurrent version is significantly slower when using automatic collection
triggering is that it’s a consequence of my testing harness. Currently, it runs all the tests in
a loop, so the single-threaded benchmark could run directly after the multi-threaded one and be
forced to clean up some of its garbage.</p>

<p>In any event, let’s move on to the results from the multi-threaded benchmark.</p>

<p><img src="https://claytonwramsey.github.io/assets/img/dumpster/scaling.png" alt="
    A scatter plot, titled &quot;Parallel garbage collector scaling.&quot;
    The x-axis is labeled &quot;Number of threads&quot; and varies from 1 to 16.
    The y-axis is labeled &quot;Time for 1M ops (ms)&quot; and varies from 0 to 3500.
    On the legend, there are four series: dumpster (sync), dumpster (sync/manual), shredder, and
    Arc.
    The points associated with shredder's series start out at 3500ms for 1 thread, scaling
    asymptotically down to roughly 1800ms at 6 threads.
    All other points are very close to zero.

<p>The only other concurrent garbage collector available for me to test against was <code>shredder</code>, and it
looks like it wasn’t much of a competition.</p>

<p><img src="https://claytonwramsey.github.io/assets/img/dumpster/scaling_sans_shredder.png" alt="
    A scatter plot, titled &quot;Parallel garbage collector scaling (sans shredder).&quot;
    The x-axis remains the same as before, but now the y-axis only goes up to 200ms.
    &quot;shredder&quot; has been removed from the legend, but otherwise it is the same as the previous image.
    The points associated with dumpster (sync) and dumpster (sync/manual) start out at roughly
    80 ms for 1 thread, jump up to about 110 ms for 2 threads, then decrease asymptotically to
    around 70 ms for 16 threads.
    Meanwhile, the points associated with Arc start out at roughly 70 ms for 1 thread and decrease
    asymptotically with the thread count to around 25 ms for 15 threads.
"></p>

<p><code>dumpster</code> doesn’t scale as smoothly as I’d like with thread count, but it’s a relief that
performance does actually improve with thread count, except for the jump from one thread to two.
I think being only 3x slower than Arc is a decent victory, especially for a project that I wasn’t
paid any money to do.
I’m not much of an expert at high-performance computing in concurrent situations, so trying to
optimize this further would likely just be an adventure in trying random things and seeing if they
yield an improvement.
If anyone out there has clever ideas on how to optimize this approach, let me know!
My email is on the “About” page.</p>

<h2 id="coda">Coda</h2>

<p>Over the last few months, I built a garbage collector for Rust from scratch.
I implemented a novel (ish) algorithm of my own design, got it to work in both single-threaded and
multi-threaded contexts, and showed that it was actually pretty performant.</p>

<p>The implementation of this crate is now <a href="https://crates.io/crates/dumpster">up on crates.io</a> and
available for anyone to download.
It’s licensed under the GNU GPLv3.</p>

<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://wisha.page/">Wisha</a>, <a href="https://seniormars.github.io/">Charlie</a>,
and <a href="https://shreyasminocha.me/">Shreyas</a> for reviewing this post, fielding my bad questions, and
putting up with me rambling about this for nearly two months straight.</p>

<h2 id="postscript">Postscript</h2>

<p>I have a few things that I thought were interesting along the way but didn’t quite have a good spot
to include in the story above, so they’ll all be mish-mashed in here.</p>

<h3 id="ode-to-bad-good-ideas">Ode to bad good ideas</h3>

<p>The final, polished solution you see in this blog post is actually quite far from my original idea.
In particular, almost all of my first ideas for handling concurrency didn’t work.
Here’s a quick roll of them all:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wrap a <code>Mutex</code> around every single allocation’s reference count and hold them while doing <code>dfs</code></li>
  <li>Save on space in <code>Gc</code>s by tagging only the lowest bit instead of adding an entire <code>usize</code></li>
  <li>Make everything enable dynamic dispatch so we can have real Java-like objects</li>
  <li>Clean up allocations locally on every thread</li>
  <li>Avoid directly dropping allocations and instead cleverly decrement their reference count</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cool-nightly-tricks">Cool nightly tricks</h3>

<p><code>Rc</code> and the other pointer types are somewhat “blessed” in that they can access nightly features
from the Rust compiler and still be consumed by stable projects.
<code>dumpster</code> has no such blessings.</p>

<p>I would like to implement <code>CoerceUnsized</code> unconditionally for all my garbage collectors, but that’s
simply not possible on stable yet.</p>

<p>Likewise, pending the implementation of strict provenance, there’s actually no way for a stable
crate to manipulate the address portion of a fat pointer.
This means that even if I found some space optimization using lower bit tagging, I wouldn’t be able
to use it because it’s gated behind a nightly feature.</p>

<h3 id="another-path-to-gcdyn-t">Another path to <code>Gc&lt;dyn T&gt;</code></h3>

<p>Without the ability to coerce <code>Gc</code> as an unsized type, I can’t make <code>Collectable</code> object safe due to
the function signature of <code>accept</code>, which forces <code>Visitor</code> to also be object-safe, forcing <code>visit</code>
operations to also be object-safe.</p>

<p>I’ve thought of a slightly different approach, though.
We can make <code>Visitor</code> a single concrete type, and that makes <code>Collectable</code> trivially object-safe.
The downside here is that I would then have to store all 5 of my current visitor implementations in
the same structure, and that loses a lot of my nice type safety features and adds a large runtime
penalty.
I’m not very happy with that idea, though.</p>

<h3 id="miri-rules">Miri rules</h3>

<p>I would probably not have been able to finish this project without
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri"><code>cargo miri</code></a>.
If you haven’t heard of it, you should download it right now and run all of your Rust projects with
it.
It’s such a fantastic tool for debugging unsafe code that I wish I could have it in other languages,
too - valgrind is a poor substitute for it when using C.</p>

<h3 id="testing-and-debugging">Testing and debugging</h3>

<p>Early on, I had just a few handwritten tests.
The first reference graph that I found that gave me trouble looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>graph LR
  a --&gt; b
  b --&gt; d
  d --&gt; a
  a --&gt; c
  c --&gt; d
</code></pre>

<p>However, once I had simple graphs with multiple cycles down, it was hard to come up with new tests.
As a result, I resorted to fuzzing, using the same approach as my benchmark - randomly generating
references and then seeing if they got cleaned up properly.</p>

<p>Debugging the results of those fuzzed tests absolutely sucked, though.
The experience of trying to find the source of an issue was awful, so I ended up having to make
some (crude) tools to make the process easier.
Eventually, I had settled on printing out the reference graph at choice times during the run of my
tests and then visualizing them to get a good guess of what was wrong.
However, when making the concurrent implementation, printing something can change the execution
behavior of the program.
Not only that, it’s not always obvious what the issue is.
I had one bug which only occurred after several thousand operations had completed, resulting in
reference graphs that looked like this:</p>

Go through each warning and explain why it is a Big Problem and needs to be addressed, telling a 20-minute story of how each warning mattered in a previous version of the programming language.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      


<div id="summary">
<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
<p>I parse HackerNews (HN) “Ask HN: Who is hiring?” posts from 2013 to time of
writing and analyse them to better understand the trends in the data job
market with a focus on the fate of data science. Here are my main conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It is likely that the Data Scientist role is in a long term decline and that
skills such as data mining and visualisation are also out of favour. I argue
from data that the Data Scientist role is poorly differentiated and that its
responsibilities are being eroded by better specified roles such as ML
Engineer and Data Engineer.</p></li>
<li><p>It is likely that the ML Engineer role has seen a sustained increase in
demand which is now on par with the Data Scientist role but trending in the
opposite direction (upward!). The ML Engineer is positioned as an AI aligned
role focused on deploying custom models to production. It is a continuity of
the data engineer which, in contrast, is focused on data preparation and
other infrastructural concerns.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you do not have time to read the whole post I suggest skipping to the
“Discussion and conclusions” section for a fuller discussion including a
<em>caveat emptor</em> section.</p>
</div>
<div id="motivation-and-introduction">
<h2>MOTIVATION AND INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>I have worked in “big data”, “data science” or something adjacent for around
12 years, and in that time I have observed these fields (and their
associated roles) change a lot. I had never thought about it much because it
was never very difficult to find work, however, recent times have been a bit
different because my neck of the woods – nestled within some subset of
“data science” jobs – has been rather quite, and the few jobs popping up have
been rather specialised. I would not find the lull concerning – especially
given the back drop of an economic down turn – if it wasn’t for a suspicion
I’ve had for some time that the field is long overdue a refactoring. Some
conjecture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>“Data science” roles are not exchangeable: you couldn’t swap the role
description from two companies in the same domain and expect it to approximate
the needs of either in most cases.</p></li>
<li><p>“Data scientists” are not exchangeable: you couldn’t swap out equally
senior data scientists in the same domain and expect to get similar skills.</p></li>
<li><p>For most consumers of it, “data science” is a functional requirement, and
its commoditisation is strongly desirable.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Granted 1-3 above, the factoring of the “data science” job market into a better
defined set of roles for which the converse of 1 and 2 hold, seems all but
inevitable. I wanted to investigate whether this was afoot, and if so, to what
extent. I decided an exploratory analysis of the job market was in order.</p>
<p>In this post I’m going to be using HN job posting data with a lick of old
school NLP and statistics to analyse how noun phrases featuring a controlled
list of terms have changed since 2013. I’ll start by explaining the data and
how it is processed. I’ll then jump straight into exploratory analysis.
Finally, I’ll investigate some specific hypotheses regarding how “data science”
and associated roles are defined, and then end with a discussion of the
results.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-and-processing">
<h2>DATA AND PROCESSING</h2>
<p>You can download the final processed data used in this portion of the analysis
<a href="https://emiruz.com/post/2023-08-12-data-jobs/data/compile.csv">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> is to tech and practice what
“Paris fashion week” is to fashion. HN hosts an automated monthly recurring
post titled
<a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;query=%22Ask%20HN%3A%20Who%20is%20hiring%22&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=story">“Ask HN: Who is hiring?”</a>
in which hundreds of companies post job opportunities all over the world. As a
data source for job postings, it is unlikely that HN is representative of any
given IT job market. Those who post are more likely to be start-ups or
scale-ups, the tech and mission is likely to be trendy, the base of operation
is most likely to be somewhere cool, and so on. However, in so far as HN is an
<em>avant-garde</em> community, its adoption of tech and practices likely foreshadow
adoption writ large.</p>
<p>Collecting data from HN is easy because they make it available via a free
public <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">Firebase API</a>. The common URL
prefix for the API is:</p>
<pre><code>https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0</code></pre>
<p>All the hiring posts of interests are automatically created on a schedule by a
user called “whoishiring”. So I can easily find all these posts using the
following endpoint:</p>
<pre><code>/user/whoishiring.json</code></pre>
<p>Thereafter its just a matter of iteratively collecting the top level comments
from every “Ask HN: Who is hiring?” post using the <em>/item/{item_id}.json</em>
endpoint.</p>
<p>Once the data is collected, I extract all noun phrases matching the following
set of constraints:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Must be two words. E.g. data science, ml engineer, ai platform, etc. The
main reason is that it becomes exponentially difficult to pair down noun
phrases which mean the same thing if they can be any length. E.g. “data
engineer” versus “data engineer job”.</p></li>
<li><p>The first word must be in the following list: statistical, deeplearning,
data, nlp, llm, mlops, ai, ml. Note that the expansions of the acronyms are
reduced to acronyms in the text prior to this stage.</p></li>
<li><p>The second word must be a noun.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the code below “pairs” is the operative function. Note that I also do some
adhoc contraction of phrases into their standard acronyms or forms to reduce
the incidence of terms which mean the same but have different names.</p>

  { table(.$year, .$term) } %&gt;%

<div id="analysis">
<h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
<div id="directions-of-change">
<h2>Directions of change</h2>
<p>There are a large number of spurious and uncommon terms in the cross-tabulation
above. A useful way of cutting through the noise is to imagine the data as
residing in a high dimensional space (wherein each term is a dimension of each
year), and then considering along which axes the data tends to vary most;
otherwise known as principal component analysis (PCA). There are however two
problems with using PCA in this example:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Principal components (PCs) are not easy to interpret especially when the
principal vectors are as long as they are here.</p></li>
<li><p>The fitting procedure is sensitive to outliers, and outliers (particularly
large fractions in this case) are likely in this sort of analysis due to
happenstances of parsing text.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I can remedy (1) by using sparse PCA (PCA with regularisation) to reduce PC
vectors to just a few non-zero components, and I can remedy (2) by using a
fitting procedure for sparse PCA robust to outliers. It is trivial to implement
in R as follows:</p>
<pre><code>require(sparsepca)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Loading required package: sparsepca</code></pre>
<pre><code>pca &lt;- robspca(crosstab, k=5, verbose=F, alpha=1e-2)

row.names(pca$loadings) &lt;- colnames(crosstab)
summary(pca)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##                          PC1   PC2   PC3   PC4   PC5
## Explained variance     0.001 0.001 0.000 0.000 0.000
## Standard deviations    0.036 0.027 0.008 0.007 0.006
## Proportion of variance 0.518 0.294 0.027 0.020 0.016
## Cumulative proportion  0.518 0.812 0.838 0.858 0.874</code></pre>
<p>Note that despite the huge number of terms, over 80% of the variance can be
explained in just two components. The non-zero constituents of the first PC
are:</p>
<pre><code>pca$loadings[,1][pca$loadings[,1]!=0] %&gt;% round(2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##        data mining data visualization        ml engineer 
##              -0.11              -1.07               1.11</code></pre><p>
That is, over 50% of the variance in the cross tabulation is positively aligned
with “ml engineer” and negatively aligned with “data mining” and “data
visualization”. I can see this effect clearly by plotting the series. All
of them exhibit a clear trend.

<p>I can similarly investigate the second principal component which accounts for a

aligned with “data scientist”. As before I visualise the series (below) and
confirm that there are clear trends in both. Note the peak at which the “data

<h2>Role definitions</h2>
<p>In the following analysis I define three response terms related to whether a
post contains mention of ML Engineer, Data Engineer and Data Scientist
respectively. I’ve added the Data Engineer role into considerations because I
am curious about how it is distinguished from the ML Engineer. I also define a
collection of other terms that I think should distinguish the data scientist
from the others. That is, I expect that the engineering roles will be more
closely associated with the infrastructure and concepts, whilst the data
science role will be more associated with the verbs and artefacts. The dataset
is implemented as follows:</p>
<pre><code>txt   &lt;- read.csv("data/texts.csv")$txt

dt &lt;- 
  tibble(
    
    # Response
    is_ml = grepl("(ml|machine learning) engineers*($|[^a-z0-9])", txt),
    is_de = grepl("data engineers*($|[^a-z0-9])", txt),
    is_ds = grepl("data scientists*($|[^a-z0-9])", txt),

    # Concepts
    AI = grepl(" ai |artificial intelligence", txt),
    
    # Infrastructure
    pipeline = grepl("pipeline", txt),

    cloud    = grepl("cloud", txt),

    optimize  = grepl("optimi[sz]", txt),
    visualize = grepl("visuali[sz]", txt),
    decide    = grepl("decision|decide", txt),

    experiment = grepl("experiment", txt),
    model      = grepl("model", txt)

) %&gt;% filter(is_ml | is_ds | is_de)</code></pre>
<p>Note that the data is filtered for recency to include only posts since 2021,
in which period there are 681 posts mentioning “ML Engineer”,
1197 mentioning “Data Engineer” and 1020 mentioning
“Data Scientist”. I’ll now model each response using a logistic regression to
get some sense of how terms line up with roles.</p>
<div id="ml-engineer">
<h3>ML Engineer</h3>
<p>The ML Engineer is the role most closely positively aligned with “AI”,
“deployment”, “experimentation”, “research” and “modelling”. It is negatively
aligned with “pipeline”, “infrastructure” and “analysis”. This fits the
impression that ML Engineer is the new role most aptly aligned to “AI” which
emphasises above all the deployment of custom models to production.</p>

<div id="discussion-and-conclusions">
<h2>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<p>It serves to start with the <em>caveat emptor</em>. The study relies on HN being a
fairly accurate bellweather for trends in IT practices broadly. I think this is
the case but herein it is stated without evidence. Throughtout the study period
there are posts missing (for reasons unknown to me) which may therefore under
represent those months. I have no idea whether the proportions of roles hired
is very seasonal, but I rely on it not being the case in light of missing
months. Further, the last year or two have seen a general global economic
downturn. This may change the proportions of roles companies are hiring for,
which may inflate/deflate figures in 2022/2023 which may not hold in the longer
run.</p>
<p>There are also more technical problems. The data processing heavily leans on
NLP and the extraction of noun phrases constrained around a short control
vocabulary. Missing out key terms, or just failing to parse the text properly
may change the relative distribution of terms. Besides this, many companies
post frequently, and many posts contain multiple roles in the same text which
will likely contribute to the confounding of terms with roles.</p>
<p>Bare in mind also that this is more of an intelligence analysis which uses some
statistics, the implication being that the judgment rests on the consilience of
the conclusions herein with those from other sources, rather than the power and
correctness of the study.</p>
<p>With the caveats out of the way. I’d reason about the results as follows in so
far as it pertains to my original objective of better understanding what is
happening with the data science job market.</p>
<div id="data-science-is-in-decline-and-vaguely-defined">
<h3>1. Data science is in decline and vaguely defined</h3>
<p>It is likely that the Data Scientist role is in a long term downward
trend and that skills such as data mining and visualisation are also out of
favour. This is evidenced by a consistent downward slope for the term “data
scientist” since 2015, whilst other data roles retained or increased their
share of mentions as shown in the plot below.</p>
<div><p><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-14"></span>
<img src="https://emiruz.com/post/2023-08-12-data-jobs/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" alt="Data scientist role over time  in contrast to other data jobs." width="672"></p><p>
Figure 4: Data scientist role over time in contrast to other data jobs.
</p>
</div>
<p>Further, the second principal component which accounts for about 30% of
explained variance is associated mostly with the “data scientist” term making
the case that (1) it is a significant HN trend (i.e.&nbsp;the correlation
structure of other terms align with it), (2) it is relatively orthogonal to
other changes (in terms of direction of variance, not trend) and (3) it is
outsized in comparison to other trends.</p>
<p>In contrast to the ML/Data Engineer role, the Data Scientist role is difficult
to distinguish. Of the terms which I had tried, the Data Scientist is only
closely aligned with “analysis”, but not with “research”, “experimentation”,
“decision”, “insight”, “discovery”, “visualization” and so on. I speculate that
the Data Scientist role was more of a catch all bucket which encompassed data
engineering, deployment and other responsibilities, and now that better aligned
roles are are being sought after, there is less work for data scientists to do.</p>
<p>Finally, the Data Scientist role doesn’t appear to be aligned with “artificial
intelligence” related terms. In so far as these are poised to define how data
roles are marketed, I would take this to be another negative indicator for the
prospect of the data science role.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-ml-engineer-is-up-and-coming-ai-aligned-and-better-specified">
<h3>2. The ML Engineer is up and coming, AI aligned and better specified</h3>
<p>It is likely that the ML Engineer role has seen a sustained increase in demand
which is now on par with “Data Scientist” (as a fraction of mentions) but
trending in the opposite direction (upwards). This is evidenced in the plots
above but also in that the trend when combined with changes in “data
visualization” and “data mining” accounts for more than 50% of explained
variance. I.e. it is a significant trend for the correlation structure of all
terms considered.</p>
<p>Much like the Data Engineer role, the ML Engineer is fairly well defined. It is
closely positively aligned with “AI”, “deployment”, “experimentation”,
“research” and “modelling”, but unaligned with data engineering and data
science terms such as “pipeline”, “infrastructure” and “analysis”. I therefore
suspect that ML Engineers will specialise towards the training of custom models
and their deployment to production.</p>

Camargo, Jr. Positive association between altitude and suicide in 2584 U.S.counties. <em>High Alt. Med. Biol.</em> 12: 31–35 2011.—Suicide is an important public health problem worldwide. Recent preliminary studies have reported a positive correlation between mean altitude and the suicide rate of the 48 contiguous U.S.states. Because intrastate altitude may have large variation, we examined all 2584 U.S. counties to evaluate whether an independent relationship between altitude and suicide exists. We hypothesized that counties at higher elevation would have higher suicide rates. This retrospective study examines 20 yr of county-specific mortality data from 1979 to 1998. County altitude was obtained from the U.S. Geologic Survey. Statistical analysis included Pearson correlation, <em>t</em> tests, and multivariable linear and logistic regression. Although there was a negative correlation between county altitude and all-cause mortality (<em>r</em> = −0.31, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001), there was a strong positive correlation between altitude and suicide rate (<em>r</em> = 0.50, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). Mean altitude differed in the 50 counties, with the highest suicide rates compared to those with the lowest rates (4684 vs. 582 ft, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). Controlling for percent of age &gt;50 yr, percent male, percent white, median household income, and population density of each county, the higher-altitude counties had significantly higher suicide rates than the lower-altitude counties. Similar findings were observed for both firearm-related suicides (59% of suicides) and nonfirearm-related suicides. We conclude that altitude may be a novel risk factor for suicide in the contiguous United States.</p><p><strong>Key Words: </strong><span>altitude, suicide, firearm, obesity, hypoxia</span></p></div><div id="s001"><h2 id="s001title">Introduction</h2><p>I<span>n</span> 2002 <span>there were at least</span> 1.5 <span>million deaths</span> worldwide from self-inflicted injuries, which made it the 14th most common cause of death (Mathers and Loncar, <a href="#B16" rid="B16">2006</a>). In the next 20 yr, suicide is expected to reach over 2 million deaths and will rank 12th in the world as a cause of mortality (Mathers and Loncar, <a href="#B16" rid="B16">2006</a>). Recognized risk factors for suicide include older ages, male sex, white race, low income, owning firearms, isolation, divorce, serotonin dysfunction, incarceration, substance abuse, and reduced levels of cholesterol (Stack, <a href="#B26" rid="B26">2000</a>; Ellison and Morrison, <a href="#B8" rid="B8">2001</a>; Goldsmith, <a href="#B10" rid="B10">2001</a>; Hemenway and Miller, <a href="#B12" rid="B12">2002</a>; Singh and Siahpush, <a href="#B25" rid="B25">2002</a>; Zill et al., <a href="#B34" rid="B34">2004</a>; Dumais et al., <a href="#B7" rid="B7">2005</a>; Daly et al., <a href="#B6" rid="B6">2007</a>). Psychiatric illness, mood disorders, and sociocultural issues are also important risk factors (Nock, <a href="#B19" rid="B19">2010</a>). Alcoholism has been associated with high suicide rates in Euopean countries, and impulsiveness and political violence are associated with suicide in southeast Asian countries (Maris, <a href="#B15" rid="B15">2001</a>). For unexplained reasons, suicide rates are higher in the western United States (CDC, <a href="#B4" rid="B4">1997</a>).</p><p>Increased altitude has recently been shown to have a protective association with certain medical illnesses, with apparent decreases in mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease receiving dialysis (Winkelmayer et al., <a href="#B31" rid="B31">2009</a>), coronary artery disease (Baibas et al., <a href="#B1" rid="B1">2005</a>; Faeh et al., <a href="#B9" rid="B9">2009</a>), and stroke (Faeh et al., <a href="#B9" rid="B9">2009</a>). By contrast, increased altitude may enhance psychiatric disorders, such as panic attacks (Roth et al., <a href="#B22" rid="B22">2002</a>). We (Cheng et al., <a href="#B5" rid="B5">2005</a>) have hypothesized a positive correlation between the mean altitude and suicide rate of the 48 contiguous United States. Because intrastate altitude may have wide variations, we have examined all 2584 contiguous U.S. counties to evaluate whether an independent relationship between altitude and suicide exists. We hypothesized that counties at high elevation would have higher suicide rates.</p></div><div id="s002"><h2 id="s002title">Methods</h2><p>This retrospective study used mortality data assembled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC mortality data are based on the underlying cause of death, which is defined by the World Health Organization as “the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury.” (CDC Suicide Mortality, <a href="#B3" rid="B3">2009</a>). Suicide was selected by CDC staff from the conditions entered by the physician on the cause of death section of the original death certificate. When more than one cause or condition was entered by the physician, the underlying cause was determined by the sequence of conditions on the certificate, provisions of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), and associated selection rules and modifications. For analysis of injury mortality data, the causes of death were classified by both intent and mechanism. The focus of the present study was death from self-inflicted injury, and the mechanism was either firearm-related or nonfirearm-related.</p><p>Accordingly, we used the Ninth International Classification of Disease (ICD9) codes to identify suicide deaths (ICD9 codes 950–959) and deaths from any cause (ICD9 codes 000–999.9). The suicide rates reported are age-adjusted deaths (&gt;5 yr), with deaths per 100,000 at the county level for the contiguous 48 states during the 20-yr span of ICD 9 classification from1979 to 1998. Counties with unreliable suicide rates were defined by the CDC as having ≤20 cumulative deaths during this 20-year interval. All counties with unreliable data (<em>n</em> = 484 of 3068; 15.8%) were excluded from the primary analysis.</p><p>Covariates include percentage of people of age &gt;50 yr, male, white, and median household income and population density, with all these variables obtained from the 1990 U.S. Census (U.S. Population Census, <a href="#B29" rid="B29">2009</a>). The 1990 Census was chosen, since this was midway in the 20-yr period that we used to extract mortality data from the CDC.</p><p>County elevation for all 2584 counties was obtained from the U.S. Geologic Survey (U.S. Geological County Survey, <a href="#B28" rid="B28">2009</a>). The latitude and longitude coordinates of the center of each U.S. county were joined to the National Elevation Database (NED) to determine and represent the elevation for each county. NED is a seamless database composed of the best raster elevation data only for the 48 contiguous U.S. states; NED's vertical accuracy is reported as 8 ft (root mean square error) (National Elevation Database, <a href="#B17" rid="B17">2009</a>).</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Stata 10.0 from StataCorp in College Station, Texas, USA. The specific tests were Pearson correlation, Student's <em>t</em> test, and multivariable linear and logistic regression. In addition to the primary analysis on altitude and suicide mortality, we examined altitude and all-cause mortality. We also performed a sensitivity analysis to examine if the altitude–suicide finding was modified by the firearm status (yes or no) of the suicide death. All <em>p</em> values are two-tailed, with <em>p</em> &lt; 0.01 considered statistically significant.</p></div><div id="s003"><h2 id="s003title">Results</h2><p>During the 1979–1998 span, there were 596,704 (1.4%) suicide deaths in the United States, among 42,868,100 total deaths. Overall, the median age-adjusted suicide rate per 100,000 in a U.S. county was 14 (interquartile range [IQR], 12–17). The median suicide rate across counties was higher among men (24, IQR 21–29) than women (6, IQR 5–7). When only the suicide rate by firearms was considered, the median rate was 10 per 100,000 (IQR, 8–12), while the nonfirearm median rate was 4 (IQR 3–5).</p><p>With regard to primary exposure, county elevation, the overall median value across counties was 892 ft (IQR 463–1594 ft). With regard to covariates, the median of the percentage of counties that was of age &gt;50 yr was 27% (IQR 24–31%). The median value for other factors was male 49% (IQR 48–50%), white 94% (IQR 81–98%), median family income $22,662 (IQR $19,623–$26,802), and population density 38 (IQR 16–90) individuals per square mile.</p><p>Despite a negative correlation (<em>r</em> = −0.31, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) between county altitude and the all-cause mortality rate, there was a strong positive correlation (<em>r</em> = 0.50, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) between altitude and suicide rate at the county level (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3114154/figure/f1/" target="figure" rid-figpopup="f1" rid-ob="ob-f1" co-legend-rid="lgnd_f1"><span>Fig. 1</span></a>). Positive correlations were also observed for both firearm-related suicides (<em>r</em> = 0.40, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) and nonfirearm-related suicides (<em>r</em> = 0.31, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). Controlling for five potential confounders (percent of age &gt;50 yr, percent male, percent white, median household income, median family income, and population density of each county), increasing altitude deciles were associated with significantly higher suicide rates (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3114154/table/T1/" target="table" rid-figpopup="T1" rid-ob="ob-T1" co-legend-rid=""><span>Table 1</span></a>).

The ratio in average suicide rates between the 50 highest and lowest counties was 4.2 (30.5:7.2). Mean altitude greatly differed between the 50 counties with the highest suicide rates compared with those with the lowest rates (4684 vs. 582 ft, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Because the Mountain Region (CDC region 8) is already known to have high suicide rates (CDC, <a href="#B4" rid="B4">1997</a>), we repeated this analysis, after removing the CDC Mountain Region, and then determined the 50 counties with the highest suicide rates and the 50 counties with the lowest suicide rates in the United States. The ratio between suicide rates remained high (25.5:7.3 = 3.5). Without the Mountain Region, mean altitude differed between the 50 counties with the highest suicide rates compared with those with the lowest rates, respectively (2075 vs. 497 ft, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Because 59% of suicides involve firearms, we restricted the analysis to suicide by firearms only. We then compared the 50 counties with the highest firearm suicide rates with the 50 counties with the lowest firearm suicide rates. The ratio of the suicide rates in these two groups of counties also was elevated (22.6:2.9 = 7.8). The mean altitude again differed between the 50 counties with the highest firearm suicide rates compared with those with the lowest firearm suicide rates (4098 vs. 324 ft, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001).</p><p>It could be argued that altitude-related suicide may be owing to more firearm usage at higher altitude, and suicide per se may be unrelated to altitude. However, we also found a positive relationship between altitude and nonfirearm-related suicide. There was a 12.5-fold (10.0:0.8) difference in suicide rate between the counties with the 50 highest nonfirearm suicides versus those with the lowest nonfirearm suicides, and the mean altitude in the 50 counties with the highest and lowest nonfirearm suicide rates was 3699 ft versus 954 ft (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001).</p><p>All the results in the previous analyses have been calculated using the reliable suicide data from 2584 counties. As noted under Methods, 484 counties did not have reliable data available owing to their having ≤20 suicide deaths in a 20-yr span; consequently, they were excluded from our analyses. Perchance, these missing data would affect the association between altitude and suicide. When these unreliable suicide rates were used, in lieu of removing them from the analysis, the positive correlation between county elevation and suicide rate persisted (<em>r</em> = 0.45, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001).</p></div><div id="s004"><h2 id="s004title">Discussion</h2><p>Using U.S. national data from 1978 to 1998, we found that county altitude had a significant positive association with overall suicide rates, firearm-related suicide rates, and nonfirearm-related suicides. Altitude was associated with overall suicide rate even after controlling for five potential confounders. The correlation between altitude and suicide could be mitigated by a positive correlation between altitude and all-cause mortality over the same period. On the contrary, we found a significant negative correlation between altitude and all-cause mortality, a finding that highlights the novelty and strength of the observed relationship between altitude and suicide. Using a different methodology, a similar, strong positive correlation between altitude and suicide rates has recently been reported by Kim and colleagues, (<a href="#B13" rid="B13">2011</a>) using all counties in the United States as well as all 233 counties in South Korea.</p><p>Our previous abstract work on altitude and suicide (Cheng et al., <a href="#B5" rid="B5">2005</a>) was done by comparing mean state altitude with suicide data for entire states and was repeated by others using peak altitude for each state and state capital city elevations (Haws et al., <a href="#B11" rid="B11">2009</a>). Although both studies reported strong correlations (<em>r</em> = 0.75 and 0.74, respectively), they were inconclusive. In these studies the mean or highest state altitude (Cheng et al., <a href="#B5" rid="B5">2005</a>; Haws et al., <a href="#B11" rid="B11">2009</a>) or the elevation of the state capital city (Haws et al., <a href="#B11" rid="B11">2009</a>) was used to represent the altitude of the entire state. However, because U.S. states vary greatly in altitude and the foregoing methodology severely minimizes this variation, we considered these initial findings to be of a preliminary nature only. For example, New York varies from sea level to 5344 ft and California from −282 to 14,505 ft. With such heterogeneity in elevation on a state basis, it would be difficult to conclude that elevation might be related to suicide, despite the strong ecologic correlation. Counties vary much less in altitude than an entire state. For this reason, we thought that reexamining this association on a county level would address this limitation.</p><p>If there were no link between altitude and suicide, there is little reason why the 50 counties with the highest suicide rates should differ in elevation when compared to the counties with the 50 lowest suicide rates. We found, however, that there was an almost 8-fold difference in altitude in these two groups of counties. When suicides were divided by firearm status (yes or no), the difference in altitude between the 50 counties with the highest and lowest suicide rates was 4.3 and 3.8, respectively. Prior reports of increased suicides in the U.S. Mountain Region (e.g., Colorado) have prompted speculation that the excess is owing to greater access to firearms, increased isolation, or reduced income (CDC, <a href="#B4" rid="B4">1997</a>). Even after controlling for these variables in our analysis, the positive correlation between altitude and suicide still exists, which suggests that the increased suicide rate in the regions with greatest altitude, such as the Mountain Region, may be owing to, at least in part, its altitude per se.</p><p>Although a discussion of potential mechanisms is speculative at this juncture, we believe it appropriate to guide further investigation into this novel finding. For example, altitude is a well-known cause of hypoxia, and the greater the elevation, the greater the hypoxia. Chronic hypoxia also is thought to increase mood disturbances, especially in patients with emotional instability (Shukitt and Banderet, <a href="#B23" rid="B23">1988</a>; Nicholas et al., <a href="#B18" rid="B18">2000</a>; Nock et al., <a href="#B19" rid="B19">2010</a>). The relationship between mood and hypoxia is complex, because oxygen therapy, while beneficial to pulmonary function in hypoxic patients with sleep apnea, was found not to improve mood (Yu et al., <a href="#B33" rid="B33">1999</a>).</p><p>Humans have well-known physiologic responses to mild and moderate chronic hypoxia, such as increased 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and a shift to the right in the hemoglobin–oxygen dissociation curve (Winslow, <a href="#B32" rid="B32">2007</a>); but not all people respond equally to hypoxia or increased altitude owing to variations in hemoglobin affinity for oxygen and other mechanisms (Winslow, <a href="#B32" rid="B32">2007</a>). If the mechanism of the suicide–altitude relationship were hypoxia, we would anticipate that there may be increased mood disturbances at high altitude in those with sleep apnea (Peppard et al., <a href="#B20" rid="B20">2009</a>) or moderate or heavy smokers at high altitude.</p><p>Future studies may or may not confirm the altitude–suicide association in other parts of the world. Should the association not be present in some other locations with comparable variation in altitude, it is possible that our findings are owing to conditions that are more common in the United States. For example, although obesity rates are rising worldwide, they have been high in the United States for decades (Peppard et al., <a href="#B20" rid="B20">2009</a>). Obesity is known to cause increased hypoxia owing to sleep apnea and thereby may create a mood disturbance (Rigby et al., <a href="#B21" rid="B21">2004</a>); one might anticipate that the altitude–suicide finding might be heightened in obese individuals. Known periodic breathing at high altitude may further exacerbate the effects of sleep apnea and nocturnal hypoxia (West et al., <a href="#B30" rid="B30">1986</a>, Khoo et al., <a href="#B14" rid="B14">1996</a>; Bloch, <a href="#B2" rid="B2">2010</a>).</p><p>A potential limitation regarding the altitude–suicide finding is heterogeneity in altitude within counties. Although the problem is obviously worse when considering entire states (Cheng et al., <a href="#B5" rid="B5">2005</a>), it is a lesser concern even for large counties. However, the consistency of the association across different measures of altitude [i.e., when measured at both the state level (Cheng et al., <a href="#B5" rid="B5">2005</a>; Haws et al., <a href="#B11" rid="B11">2009</a>) and now the county level] suggests that the association is not spurious. We addressed other potential limitations in the analysis (e.g., contribution of Mountain states, exclusion of unreliable data), and the altitude–suicide finding was very robust.</p><p>Despite the strong association between suicide and altitude, other factors may be responsible for this association that are directly related to high altitude per se, for example, low barometric pressure (Shukitt et al., <a href="#B24" rid="B24">1998</a>). Many demographic, psychiatric, and sociocultural factors are associated with suicide, and association between high altitude and suicide is speculative. But when other risk factors were considered, the strong association between altitude and suicide was still present in suicides overall and in suicides both with and without firearms. This strong association (<em>r</em> = 0.50) is rendered even stronger by the overall negative association between all deaths and altitude (<em>r</em> = −0.31).</p><p>In summary, altitude is strongly associated with suicide rates in the United States. This novel finding is not explained by county differences in demographic factors, income, or geographic isolation. Future studies might focus on the individual differences between these high and low altitude areas, both at the biochemical level (e.g., glycolysis, serotonin metabolism, oxygen transport) and the level of the entire organism (e.g., differences in arterial oxygen compared with pulse oximetry, body mass index, sleep apnea, smoking, or behavioral distinctions). Ultimately, this mechanistic search might help clinicians to identify individuals at high altitude who may be amenable to relocation to lower altitude areas, oxygen therapy, or special monitoring and intervention (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, <a href="#B27" rid="B27">2009</a>).</p></div><div id="s005"><h2 id="s005title">Acknowledgments</h2><!--/article/back/sec/--><p>Dr. Camargo was supported in part by NIH U01 MH-88278 (Bethesda, Maryland, USA).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>DEF CON</span> A bomb threat against Caesars Forum, the main venue for this week's DEF CON hacking convention, led to the halls being cleared on Saturday evening and the building searched by fire crews and police officers.</p>
<p>The timing was very bad, coming in the evening of the main party night for the event. The conference Goons, the red-shirted volunteers who serve as guides and organizers, were praised by attendees for managing the evacuation with aplomb, but when it became clear that the search for the suspect device was going to be hard to find, the DEC CON team cancelled the evening's festivities at Caesars, to the disappointment of thousands.</p>
<p>"Last night we were asked to evacuate the building due to a report of a suspicious package. Local police and fire departments conducted a thorough investigation and ultimately determined that the package was safe," the organizers said.</p>

    

<p>"They also conducted additional sweeps of the building as a precaution before allowing our team to return and prepare for today’s con. We are working quickly to keep the original schedule on track, but please check here for additional updates before arriving at DEF CON."</p>

        


        

<p>The event kicked off on August 10 and wrapped up by August 13.</p>
<p>Presumably the hoax caller thought of themselves as a merry prankster, rather than the selfish idiot who ruined everyone's night - particularly the timing for those in the Track Four hall who were enjoying <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> and who were forced to miss the crucial last 10 minutes of the movie. While tricks and pranks are something of a tradition, they only get respect if they are clever and intricate, not some fool showing they could use a telephone.</p>

</div>
<p>It's not like security at the show wasn't heavy enough. The event was patrolled regularly by security guards in body armor with handguns, tasers, the occasional police dog, and a host of other equipment that was a bit of an overkill for a bunch of peaceable hackers.</p>
<p>Dubbed by some as "Gravy SEALs," by the end of the show they were visibly warming up, and this hack saw several of them accepting stickers from attendees.</p>
<h3>The great badge fiasco</h3>
<p>The badge situation at the conference's start did peeve quite a few people, and one of them may have been the wazzock behind the bomb hoax.</p>
<p>DEF CON badges are legendary. Usually consisting of a circuit board, a port or too, and an interesting puzzle to solve or challenge to complete – such as a scavenger hunt – they are highly collectable and can fetch high prices if resold. So it came as a shock to many when they were told that the badges weren't available in large numbers and were given paper badges.</p>

        

<p>What made this particularly hard to swallow was that DEF CON really jacked up its prices this year. Last year's tickets cost $360 each, whereas this year the price rose to $440. While the venue was much better than previous years, and the DJ lineup in the chillout rooms was much improved, not getting the prized badge annoyed many people – some of whom got up early to queue in the infamous LineCon queue to pick one up.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/08/14/defcon.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/08/14/defcon.jpg?x=648&amp;y=486&amp;infer_y=1" alt="defcon" title="defcon" height="486" width="648"></a></p><p>DEF CON 31: from tiny acorns mighty oak trees grow</p>
</div>
<p>Officially the excuse was that production and shipping problems had led to the shortage. However, two Goons told this hack that the issue had been one of oversupply at previous conventions, and that only those who had preordered their tickets were guaranteed a badge.</p>
<p>Some more did show up during the show, but were quickly grabbed by attendees, leading to jokes about LineCon 2. Still, it's not a good look and left a sour taste in the mouth of some.</p>
<h3>My god, it's full of hackers!</h3>
<p>The badge kerfuffle certainly didn't seem to put too many people off attending.</p>
<p>While official attendance figures haven't been released, sources close to the matter tell us that over 30,000 people attended DEF CON this year, compared to about 20,000 for Black Hat. The halls were noticeably fuller than past years and on day one only one hall was open for speakers and the lines were very long.</p>
<p>But the new venue had space for almost everyone to get in or stand at the back. This is a huge improvement over previous years, where you'd have to get in line more than half an hour before some talks.</p>

</ul>
<p>This wasn't true everywhere however. The queues for the AI Village were initially immense, and for some others, including the Blacks in Cybersecurity Village. The Aerospace Village was seldom not jam packed, and even lines for the official merchandising room were immense.</p>

<p>Still, the quality of the talks was better than average, even if the timing wasn't. On the Friday 0900, opening sessions we covered included the Veilid keynote, but at the same time DEF CON founder Jeff Moss, aka Dark Tangent, hosted the opening speech and then sat down for an extra 30 minutes with the Secretary of the DHS Alejandro Mayorkas to discuss the policy and practice of America's online government role and how it interacts with the security community.</p>
<p>Also in the same time slot was the official start of the AI hacking challenge and separate session on the Security Research Legal Defense Fund – an initiative to provide free legal advice and support for white-hat hackers who are being prosecuted for conducting legitimate research in a way that could break onerous laws like the DMCA.</p>
<h3>Doctorow's prescription for a new internet</h3>
<p>And speaking of the DMCA and other restrictive laws, Cory Doctorow was on form with a talk entitled "An audacious plan to halt the internet's enshitification."</p>
<p>His argument is that a lack of antitrust laws, specifically allowing companies to sell goods below cost to drive out competition and a relaxed attitude to mega mergers, has left almost every major market in the US – from broadband to media to even candy makers, in the hands of a few corporations who then abuse their market position.</p>
<p>When the internet first became a thing it was a great disruptor, he pointed out, because open standards allowed free competition and a thriving state of innovation. Then the very companies that benefited from things like being able to reverse-engineer APIs and coding, such as Apple, Google, and Facebook, have since supported laws to ban such practices and ensure their continued dominance.</p>

        

<p>As this has happened the internet has in many ways gone backwards. Originally envisaged as a way to cut out the middleman and reduce costs and speed transaction, this plan worked - for a while. Now it's back with a vengeance and the middlemen hold the whip hand, for the moment, and are squeezing consumers, businesses, and now their own workers hard.</p>
<p>"Remember when tech workers dreamed of working for a big company before striking out on their own to start and put that big company out of business? Then that dream shrank, to working for a few years, quitting and doing a fake startup to get hired back by your old boss in the world's most inefficient way to get a raise," he said.</p>
<p>"Next it shrank even further, you're working for a tech giant your whole life but you get free kombucha and massages. And now that dream is over and all that's left is work with a tech giant until they fire your ass, like those 12,000 Googlers who got fired six months after a stock buyback that would have paid their salaries for the next 27 years. We deserve better than this."</p>

</div>
<p>While President Carter might have started the move against antitrust enforcement, his Democratic successor President Biden has become the first occupant of the White House to try and stop this consolidation. FTC chair Lina Khan might have had a couple of high-profile failures, he opined, but many more smaller cases and some corporate consolidations have been dropped or suspended</p>
<p>And it's becoming a bipartisan issue that's making strange bedfellows in the normally closed ranks of bipartisan politics in America.</p>
<p>"There's a bill in Congress right now called the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1073?s=1&amp;r=38">America Act</a> that will break up Facebook and Google and its sponsors are Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)!"</p>
<p>This appears to be a global phenomenon too. The EU and even China are working on interoperability and breaking up companies that get too big and powerful for free markets. The tide seems to be shifting, yet there remains a long way to go.</p>
<h3>War stories</h3>
<p>The War Stories track, held this year in Harrah's, produced two standout talks.</p>
<p>The first, from EFF security analyst and top boffin Cooper Quintin, covered the Dark Caracal spyware slinger. Cooper and his team have been tracking this miscreant for over six years now and it appears that the protagonist is a worker with the Lebanese government intelligence agency who freelances in crime in their spare time.</p>
<p>When first spotted they weren't very good, forgetting to register the domain for one of their command and control servers for the Bandook spyware which allowed the EFF to bag it first and then monitor traffic. The criminal has since come back with a better Bandook 2 version, which is harder to track.</p>
<p>But recently the EFF team noticed something odd - Dark Caracal was hitting a huge number of targets in the Dominican Republic and infecting them with Clop ransomware. Cooper speculated that the Dominican Republic was targeted because it's low tech and Interpol and others aren't too focussed on the country right now, as they have bigger fish to fry.</p>
<p>He speculated that we are seeing a new breed of cyber mercenaries that are crossing over from national state spyware into more lucrative fields and said this could be the biggest threat for 30 years. That seems a little pessimistic, but this is going to be an area to watch.</p>
<p>Another great talk was from Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at WithSecure, about the history between his native Finland (NATO's newest member) and Russia. He described how, at the start of the 20th Century, Finland was forced to give up land to Russia in exchange for independence and that - rather than live under Russian rule - a man and his family packed up their house (and sauna) and moved West to freedom.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/08/14/mikko.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/08/14/mikko.jpg?x=648&amp;y=391&amp;infer_y=1" alt="mikko" title="mikko" height="391" width="648"></a></p><p>Don't make us go sisu on you</p>
</div>
<p>That man was Mikko's ancestor and the CRO's mother became one of the first women to operate Finland's computer infrastructure, and she taught her son all about coding. What follows is one of the best talks on the history of Russian computer crime this hack has seen in a long time.</p>
<p>Russia pioneered this stuff, first on Bluetooth and then on other platforms - almost always avoiding interfering in their own country but wreaking havoc elsewhere. Unlike shy Western agencies who hate being exposed, the Russian operatives are very blatant and as long as its operators stay within the borders of the largest country in the world they are almost always safe.</p>
<p>This talk is well worth a look once the video comes out and the organizers have already started <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/@DEFCONConference">putting content up</a> for free. If you couldn't make it to the sweaty hell that was Las Vegas this year, you can still get the data without paying Black Hat rates. ®</p>

This article is written without reference to and supersedes the original.</em></p><figure><figcaption>The tail section of Bashkirian Airlines flight 2937 lies in a field where it came to rest outside Überlingen, Germany. (Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives)</figcaption></figure><p id="fc3c">It is perhaps one of the saddest stories in the history of commercial aviation: a plane full of a Russian republic’s brightest young students — her aspiring artists, musicians, and athletes — ripped so cruelly from the sky, their hopes and dreams scattered across the fields of southern Germany. It is a story of split-second decisions, made amid a fog of confusion in the dead of night, which sent two airliners careening into one another at 35,000 feet. It is a story of a tragedy which could have been avoided, and of a man in the throes of grief who sought his own perverted justice in the murder of the air traffic controller he deemed responsible.</p><p id="2f2c">The tragic tale of the Überlingen disaster and its aftermath comes across like a modern-day Shakespearean drama. But the crash was also about a fundamental blind spot in the global air traffic control system, a gap whose existence authorities had failed to close. And it was perhaps a distant echo of the collapse of the USSR, a reminder that the Russian and Western aviation industries still possessed divergent impulses, whose untimely intersection could plant the seeds of disaster. Now, twenty years after the accident, long after the closure of its final chapters, we can look back upon the events of the 1st of July 2002 from both perspectives — literary and scientific — to tell the story of a profound human tragedy and the deficient system which made it inevitable.</p><figure><figcaption>The city of Ufa as it appears today. (UNESCO)</figcaption></figure><p id="8621">Far to the east of Moscow, in the rolling hills along the margin of the Ural Mountains, lies the city of Ufa, capital of the autonomous Republic of Bashkortostan. Like most of the Russian interior, it fell on hard times during the 1990s, as the collapse of the Soviet Union devastated the local manufacturing industry and plunged thousands into poverty. Even by 2002, as Russia’s economy started to turn around, travel opportunities for the people of Ufa were limited.</p><p id="b847">It was therefore quite a cause for celebration when the city’s special UNESCO-affiliated school announced that its parent agency, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, would organize a field trip to a planned UNESCO youth festival on Spain’s prestigious Costa Dorada. A few dozen of the school’s top students were selected, some for their academic prowess, others for their skill in art, music, athletics, and other fields. Others bought their way in: the parents of some schoolchildren paid several hundred dollars apiece to send their children on the trip, a substantial sum of money which some could only afford at the expense of their own planned vacations.</p><figure><figcaption>This photo appears to show the children in Moscow before their flight to Barcelona. (Mayday)</figcaption></figure><p id="2a8f">The school group, including some 44 children between the ages of 8 and 18, traveled to Moscow on June 29th, 2002, where they planned to catch a commercial flight to Barcelona. But their bus driver accidentally took them to the wrong airport — Moscow has several — and they missed the flight.</p><p id="7511">While most travelers could simply go to the check-in counter and arrange to board a later flight, the group of 44 kids and five adult chaperones would need special accommodation. Stuck in Moscow while the trip organizers frantically searched for a transportation solution, the children toured the Red Square, the Kremlin, and other national landmarks, snapping photos of each other’s smiling faces in front of the high, red walls. They could not have known that their unexpected layover in the capital would be the first link in a deadly chain of events that would shock the world.</p><p id="be5c">After two days in Moscow, the school group received a lucky break: a local airline, having heard of the plight of the kids from Ufa, was able to arrange a charter flight to Barcelona on the night of July 1st. The company in question was Bashkirian Airlines, the de facto flag carrier of the Republic of Bashkortostan, which had split off from a regional Aeroflot subsidiary in 1992 and now carried passengers throughout central Russia and to popular holiday destinations abroad, including Barcelona. Between its local connections and its experience with the destination airport, it was ideally positioned to carry out the flight on short notice. And so, late on the night of the 1st of July, the kids and their chaperones boarded a Bashkirian Airlines Tupolev Tu-154 at Moscow’s Domodedovo International Airport.</p><figure><figcaption>Konstantin Kaloyev and his sister Diana before the accident. (Unknown author via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure><p id="13bb">They were joined by eight passengers who were not part of the school group, but had also missed earlier flights to Barcelona. A family of four from Belarus is thought to have been among them. Also on board were Svetlana Kaloyeva and her two children, Konstantin, 10, and Diana, 4, who were on their way to visit their father Vitaly Kaloyev, an architect from the North Caucasus town of Vladikavkaz who was working in Barcelona that summer on a vacation home for a Russian oligarch. Added onto the school group, the five other unaffiliated passengers, and the twelve crewmembers, the Kaloyev family brought the total number of people on board to 69.</p><figure><figcaption>RA-85816, theTupolev Tu-154 involved in the accident. (Torsten Maiwald)</figcaption></figure><p id="c78a">Although their three-engine Tupolev Tu-154 was designed in the 1960s in the Soviet Union, this particular example was much newer, having been produced in Russia in 1995, and was equipped with some of the latest technology. Nevertheless, a large cockpit crew was required to fly it. That night, there would be no less than five pilots aboard, including 52-year-old Captain Aleksandr Gross; 41-year-old Instructor Captain Oleg Grigoriev, the chief pilot at Bashkirian Airlines, who was overseeing Gross as he familiarized himself with the procedures at Barcelona; 50-year-old Navigator Sergei Kharlov; 37-year-old Flight Engineer Oleg Valeev; and 41-year-old First Officer Murat Itkulov. However, Instructor Captain Grigoriev was sitting in the right seat performing the duties of pilot not flying, so First Officer Itkulov simply rode along in the jump seat without being assigned any specific duties. Also on board were four flight attendants and three other Bashkirian Airlines employees riding behind as passengers, totaling twelve crewmembers.</p><figure><figcaption>The route of flight 2937 with the location of the Zürich ACC. (Google + own work)</figcaption></figure><p id="ce51">All seemed routine as the Bashkirian Tu-154, operating under the flight number BTC 2937, departed Moscow and headed west across Europe, cruising at 36,000 feet. One air traffic control sector gave way to another, and by 23:30 Central European time they were over southern Germany, passing overhead Munich. At that time, anticipating its imminent entrance into neighboring airspace controlled from Zürich, Switzerland, the Munich area controller handed the flight over to his Zürich-based counterpart.</p><p id="4ac0">That night, a single controller was handling all the airspace within the Zürich air traffic control sector. The facility handled all mid- and high-level traffic in an area covering northeastern Switzerland and southwestern Germany, as well as approach services for aircraft descending into airports in St. Gallen and Friedrichshafen. Tonight, all of these duties fell on the shoulders of just one man: Danish-born air traffic controller Peter Nielsen. Normally, this would not be a particularly stressful arrangement. Traffic in the region at this hour was usually light, since all the nearby major airports had closed for the night, leaving only high-level transiting aircraft bound for other parts of Europe. At the facility, it had become common practice for one of the two controllers on duty to take an extended rest in the break room during the middle of the night shift once the last planes had landed in St. Gallen and Friedrichshafen, and tonight was no exception. The other qualified controller left the control room at 23:15, and their assistant left ten minutes later, leaving only Nielsen and another assistant who was not authorized to control aircraft.</p><figure><figcaption>The work station where Peter Nielsen was working that night. (BFU)</figcaption></figure><p id="4daa">For Nielsen, this wasn’t an unusual situation, and he anticipated no difficulties controlling the two or three aircraft that were typically in his airspace at this time of night. But on the night of July 1st, there were additional complications. The air traffic control company had recently decided to make modifications to the way it divided the upper level airspace, necessitating several changes to the computer hardware that kept the control center running. Part way through Nielsen’s shift, a group of technicians arrived to install the update, and he was informed that his work station’s main computer would have to be shut down, causing his displays to operate in fallback mode — a secondary condition in which several features provided by the main computer became unavailable. In fallback mode, the system which automatically correlated an aircraft’s radar return with its filed flight plan would not work, forcing him to enter the information manually, and the Short-Term Conflict Alert light, which illuminates when the system predicts that two planes will pass too close, would be rendered inoperative. But Nielsen had no idea what features would be lost in fallback mode, nor did he have any obvious way of finding out. And as if that wasn’t enough, a few minutes later the technicians informed him that they would also have to disconnect the control center’s direct telephone landline to neighboring centers. The glitches were adding up, but with so few planes in the air, how dangerous could it be?</p><figure><figcaption>(Google + own work)</figcaption></figure><p id="15ec">But, just moments after the Tu-154 entered Zürich airspace, Nielsen faced another complication: an Airbus A320 belonging to German charter airline Aero Lloyd contacted Zürich, reporting that their flight had been delayed and they wanted to perform a late approach to Friedrichshafen Airport. When the second controller went off duty, no one had anticipated that an aircraft would try to land at Friedrichshafen after its nominal closing time, so Nielsen was forced to abruptly switch his focus to the approach sector, which normally wouldn’t have been his responsibility. It would have been possible to call and wake the second controller, who normally handled approach services, but for just one plane, it didn’t seem worth it. After all, with the Aero Lloyd plane already lined up for approach, all Nielsen needed to do was tell Friedrichshafen that it was coming. He picked up the direct landline to the Friedrichshafen control tower, but it had been disconnected. He tried using the regular phone system to call a posted phone number for the tower, but that didn’t work either. This was starting to become more complicated than he had anticipated.</p><figure><figcaption>An example of a TCAS display with aircraft of various threat levels. (BFU)</figcaption></figure><p id="498a">Meanwhile on board the Tu-154, the pilots spotted another plane in the distance, appearing on the situational display of their Traffic Collision Avoidance System. The system, or TCAS (tee-cas), incorporates altitude, speed, and heading information broadcast by the transponders of nearby aircraft, compares it to the aircraft’s own trajectory, and automatically assesses the relative threat of a collision. If the planes’ projected paths come too close, both airplanes’ collision avoidance systems will simultaneously issue opposite “resolution advisories,” telling one plane to climb and the other to descend. But so far, this other plane was still more than 10 nautical miles away, too distant for the system to suggest such drastic action.</p><p id="c766">Despite the distance, however, Instructor Captain Grigoriev could already see the plane’s flashing anti-collision lights blinking against the blackness of the moonless night. “Here, visually,” he said, pointing out the window. “[And] here it’s showing us zero,” he added, referring to the TCAS display, where the number representing the height difference between his aircraft and the intruder indicated zero feet.</p><figure><figcaption>A9C-DHL, the Boeing 757 involved in the accident. (Koen Gladines)</figcaption></figure><p id="76d6">This other plane was in fact DHL flight 611, a Boeing 757 cargo plane hauling packages from Bergamo, Italy to Brussels, Belgium. The flight had departed earlier that day from Bahrain, where DHL has its own local subsidiary airline, and was now on the second leg of its trip after a scheduled cargo swap in Bergamo. In command were two experienced pilots: 47-year-old Captain Paul Phillips, and 34-year-old First Officer Brant Campioni. Although they lived in Bahrain, they were originally from the UK and Canada, respectively. No one else was on board.</p><p id="bb68">Phillips and Campioni had made contact with Nielsen at 23:21 and were cleared five minutes later to climb to 36,000 feet in accordance with their flight plan. Unbeknownst to the crew or the controller, this put DHL flight 611 and Bashkirian Airlines flight 2937 on course to cross paths at the same height above an undefined point near Lake Constance on the Swiss-German border.</p><p id="4437">Now, at 23:34 and 24 seconds, First Officer Campioni said, “Excuse me, I’ll use the facilities,” and got up to go to the bathroom.</p><p id="961a">Eighteen seconds later, an automated voice called out, “TRAFFIC, TRAFFIC.” Captain Phillips’ attention was suddenly drawn to his TCAS display, where he saw an unidentified aircraft approaching from the right at approximately the same altitude. He watched it attentively, waiting to see if TCAS would issue a resolution advisory.</p><figure><figcaption>The route of DHL flight 611. (Google + own work)</figcaption></figure><p id="647e">At exactly the same moment, the same automated voice called out “TRAFFIC, TRAFFIC” in the cockpit of the Tupolev.</p><p id="05d3">“There, fucking traffic,” Instructor Captain Grigoriev said.</p><p id="6796">In the control center, Peter Nielsen suddenly noticed that the two planes appeared to be on a collision course. The Short-Term Conflict Alert light would have illuminated two minutes ago, but it wasn’t working, and Nielsen had noticed the conflict quite late. He quickly rolled his chair from the approach control station, where he had been speaking to the Aero Lloyd flight, back to the upper sector station. Leaning into the mic, he contacted the Tupolev and said, “Bravo Tango Charlie 2937, descend flight level 350, expedite, I have crossing traffic.”</p><p id="68c6">“Descend!” Grigoriev immediately ordered.</p><p id="8ac6">The instant he said this, the TCAS computer, detecting an imminent collision, issued a resolution advisory, and the robotic voice called out, “CLIMB! CLIMB!”</p><p id="bcb3">Captain Gross was already pushing his yoke forward to descend when First Officer Itkulov, observing from the jump seat, called out, “Climb, it says!”</p><p id="7aa5">“He’s guiding us down!” Grigoriev emphatically replied.</p><p id="9a3d">It was a situation for which they had never been trained: a controller telling them to descend to avoid another aircraft, while TCAS simultaneously instructed them to climb. It would obviously be impossible to comply with both. So which order should they trust? Which took priority?</p><figure><figcaption>The relative positions of the two planes as they approached one another. (BFU)</figcaption></figure><p id="adca">Meanwhile on the Boeing 757, Captain Phillips received an opposite resolution advisory. “DESCEND! DESCEND!” the robotic voice called out, and he immediately pushed his yoke forward to reach the target descent rate. The instruction came concurrently with Nielsen’s identical instruction to the Tupolev, causing him to miss this critical exchange. Both planes were now descending toward each other at a closing speed of more than 1,300 kilometers per hour.</p><p id="9963">Hearing the sound of the alarms, First Officer Campioni hurried back to the cockpit. Glancing out the window, he could clearly see the lights of the Tupolev at approximately their 2:00 position, blinking in the void. “Traffic right there,” he announced. But it was impossible to tell, without any visual reference point, whether the plane was above them or below them. All they could do was trust the TCAS resolution advisory.</p><p id="84ad">But as flight 611 descended, the projected separation distance between the two planes wasn’t changing. “INCREASE DESCENT,” the TCAS commanded. Phillips pushed forward on his yoke even harder.</p><figure><figcaption>This timeline shows just how quickly events unfolded. Communications involving the 757 are on the left, and those involving the Tupolev are on the right. (BFU)</figcaption></figure><p id="348d">In the control center, Peter Nielsen hadn’t received any acknowledgement of his instruction to the Tupolev. “Bravo Tango Charlie 2937, descend level 350, expedite descent!” he repeated.</p><p id="d55d">“Expedite descent level 350, Bravo Tango Charlie 2937,” Instructor Captain Grigoriev acknowledged.</p><p id="e5a2">For the pilots of the Tupolev, this second order removed any doubt about whom to obey. Captain Gross immediately pitched down even more, faithfully following the command to “expedite.”</p><p id="bdff">Ten seconds later, Nielsen hurriedly added, “Ja, you have traffic at your two o’clock, now at 360.” But from the perspective of the Tupolev, the traffic was at their 10:00 position, not their 2:00 position, and his misleading transmission led to confusion in the cockpit.</p><p id="d5cb">“It’s going below us!” said Navigator Kharlov.</p><p id="7f9c">“Where is it?” Grigoriev asked, peering out the window.</p><p id="4645">“Here on the left side!” said First Officer Itkulov.</p><p id="d0f8">“INCREASE CLIMB!” came the robotic voice of the TCAS.</p><p id="6bf8">“It says ‘climb’!” Itkulov repeated. But they kept descending, accelerating through -1,800 feet per minute.</p><p id="e0c2">As the Tupolev pilots frantically tried to work out what to do, Peter Nielsen, thinking he had ordered the Russian jet out of harm’s way, slid his chair back over to the approach control station, where the Aero Lloyd flight was calling him yet again. At his other station, First Officer Campioni on the Boeing 757 could be heard announcing over the radio, “Dilmun six hundred, TCAS descent!” But Nielsen never heard him.</p><figure><figcaption>A dramatized CGI animation of the moment of the collision from Mayday: Season 2 episode 4, “Deadly Crossroads.” In reality the left wing separated first, followed by the forward fuselage a full three seconds later.</figcaption></figure><p id="3ab3">Aboard the 757, it suddenly became apparent that the Tupolev, which just a few seconds ago appeared far away, was rapidly closing on their position. “Descend!” First Officer Campioni shouted. “Fuck, descend hard!”</p><p id="5918">At the same moment, the Tupolev pilots saw the Boeing 757 hurtling out of the night, headed straight for them. “Oh shit,” Captain Gross exclaimed, hauling back on his control column and pushing the engines to full power. On the 757, Captain Phillips pushed his yoke all the way to the stop in a desperate attempt to dive. And for a moment, 71 lives hung in the balance.</p><p id="2544">But it was already too late. At 23:35 and 32 seconds, the vertical tail of the 757 slammed into the underside of the Tupolev’s left wing as it passed overhead.</p><p id="c65f">“I told you it was coming from the left!” one of the Russian pilots managed to scream over the horrible roar of the impact.</p><p id="db99">Sliced nearly in two by the 757’s tailfin, its left wing ripped clean from its root, the Tu-154 began to disintegrate within seconds, spinning itself apart in a great cloud of fire. It rolled rapidly to the left, and then the fuselage failed and the plane broke in half, its cockpit and forward cabin folding back and ripping away, while the tail section and right wing, engulfed in flames, arced like a falling star across the night sky over Lake Constance.</p><figure><figcaption>The Mayday animation continues with both planes’ uncontrolled plunges toward the ground.</figcaption></figure><p id="fe16">On board the 757, the pilots felt a massive jolt, and then the plane yawed and rolled sharply as the loss of its vertical tail fatally compromised its directional stability. As it careened into this extreme maneuver, aerodynamic forces ripped off both engines, and the plane began to plunge from the sky, corkscrewing down into the dark forest below. The pilots likely fought until the end, but there was nothing they could do. About two minutes after the collision, DHL flight 611 plowed nose-first into a forest outside the village of Taisersdorf, instantly killing both crewmembers.</p><p id="ce2d">At the same time, local residents in the town of Überlingen and neighboring villages heard an explosion in the sky and looked up to see burning pieces of the shattered Tupolev raining down over an area encompassing more than 200 square kilometers. A dinner party near Owingen was interrupted when the flaming remains of the center section and right wing crashed down in the hostess’s rear garden. Nearby, the tail section slammed into a road and a field in front of a boarding school for disabled children, and about 300 meters away the severed cockpit fell to earth in an apple orchard. Other pieces of debris from both planes — the remains of the left wing, sections of the fuselage ceiling, a landing gear fairing, the tip of the 757’s stabilizer — fell like hail across a zone approximately 20 kilometers long.</p><figure><figcaption>Map of the distribution of major wreckage components. (BFU)</figcaption></figure><p id="90c9">As witnesses rushed outside, already struck with terror by the sight of the burning plane falling from 35,000 feet, they came across something even more horrible: the bodies of dozens of children, strewn for kilometers over streets, fields, and forests. The headmaster of the boarding school emerged to find about twenty dead children on his property; others found bodies in their yards, on the streets in front of their houses, and scattered in the fields around the shattered remnants of the fuselage. Not one among them had survived the fall — in fact, investigators would later determine that 40 of the 69 passengers and crew aboard the Tupolev were ejected from the plane before it hit the ground. This was a sight which would stay forever with those who witnessed it. The horror of a plane crash is bad enough when the victims are adults — but to be faced with such carnage wrought upon children is an experience which simply cannot be described.</p><figure><figcaption>Officials examine the tail section of the fallen Tupolev. (Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives)</figcaption></figure><p id="afa4">◊◊◊</p><p id="914d">Within about 15 to 20 minutes of the crash, a witness contacted Germany’s Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation, or BFU, reporting a collision of two planes over Überlingen. Upon confirming that a crash had indeed taken place, the BFU launched one of the most significant investigations in the history of modern German aviation.</p><p id="15b2">As dawn broke over Lake Constance, investigators were already on the scene, confronting a vast crash site unlike any they had previously encountered. Thousands of people worked to cordon off the area, locate wreckage, and recover human remains. It would ultimately take several days to find all the bodies, confirming a grim, self-evident truth: that none of the 71 people on board the two planes had survived. Among the dead were one Briton and one Canadian — the DHL pilots — as well as four Belarusians and 65 Russians. Forty-eight of them were children.</p><p id="515b">In the city of Ufa, home to most of the dead, the population was left in a state of shock. In addition to the talented artists and athletes, several of the victims were the children of high-ranking officials in Bashkortostan, including members of the administration of the President of the Republic. Local authorities declared a period of mourning; businesses shut their doors, festivals were cancelled, and radio stations only played sad classical music. One restaurateur who tried to put on a pop song was nearly run out of town, so intense was the city’s collective grief.</p><figure><figcaption>A reconstruction of the exact configuration in which the planes came together. (BFU)</figcaption></figure><p id="41c0">Meanwhile, by examining the wreckage, BFU investigators were able to conclude that the planes collided at an angle close to 90 degrees, and that the tail of the 757 sliced through the fuselage and left wing of the Tu-154 from underneath. The Tu-154 subsequently broke up in flight, while the 757 lost control and crashed nearby. But the mystery only deepened: how could two relatively new airplanes, both equipped with the latest Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems, collide in the tightly controlled airspace of Central Europe? Western media, apparently citing the Swiss air traffic control agency, suggested that the Russian pilots had failed to follow the controller’s instruction to descend. Russian authorities lashed out at the reports, implying that the controller was at fault for telling them to descend in the first place. It was only several days later that Swiss authorities admitted that controller Peter Nielsen had only warned the Tupolev crew 50 seconds before the collision, and that they appeared to have complied within a relatively short period.</p><figure><figcaption>The Tupolev’s forward fuselage section lies crumpled in an orchard. (BFU)</figcaption></figure><p id="6e87">The answers to the mystery lay in the planes’ black boxes, which recorded the critical conversations on both flight decks in the minutes leading up to the collision. The BFU noted that both flight recorders on the 757 cut out nine seconds after it hit the Tupolev, when the engines separated from the wings, leading to a loss of power. The Tupolev’s flight data recorder also ceased operation three seconds after the collision when the fuselage broke in two, but investigators were horrified to discover that the cockpit voice recorder, mounted in the cockpit and powered by a backup battery, continued to record for a further two minutes as the severed cockpit plunged toward the ground.</p><p id="bd91">Their disturbing final contents aside, the black boxes revealed the fundamental misunderstanding which led to the crash. Unaware that TCAS was about to issue a resolution advisory, Peter Nielsen ordered the Russian crew to descend, while TCAS simultaneously told them to climb and instructed the 757 to descend. The Russian crew, faced with a choice between the controller and their TCAS, chose to obey the controller and descended directly into the path of the 757. This raised three primary questions: could either crew still have prevented the collision, why did the Russian crew choose not to obey their TCAS, and why did the controller allow the situation to become so critical before intervening?</p><figure><figcaption>An aerial view of the forward fuselage. (FlightGlobal)</figcaption></figure><p id="437d">To answer the first question, investigators carried out a second-by-second analysis of the last minute of the two flights, from the time the crews became aware of a conflict up until the moment of the collision.</p><p id="35c8">It should be noted that both aircraft were operating on the same radio frequency, and in theory could have heard every relevant ATC communication. But a series of timing coincidences prevented either crew from realizing what was taking place. Captain Phillips on the 757 might have heard Nielsen’s order for the Tupolev to descend had it not come at exactly the same moment as his own TCAS resolution advisory, which obviously commanded greater attention. First Officer Campioni wasn’t in the cockpit at the time and could not have heard it either. The same thing happened all over again during the controller’s second order for the Tupolev to descend, which corresponded temporally with the order from Phillips’ own TCAS to “increase descent.” In this dynamic environment, Phillips’ brain would have prioritized the more immediate command from the TCAS before considering the overall situation. And again, Campioni hadn’t put his headset back on yet and couldn’t have heard the transmission.</p><p id="926f">Subsequently, the 757 crew waited 23 seconds to inform air traffic control that they were in a TCAS descent, a delay which some felt was inappropriately long. But it seemed that Captain Phillips was primarily concerned with achieving the required rate of descent, and First Officer Campioni was neither in his seat nor wearing his headset until shortly before the transmission was in fact issued. The coincidental fact that Campioni decided to go to the bathroom right before the TCAS came to life evidently contributed to the lateness of the message, and in fact had he been in the cockpit throughout the event he might have been able to inform Nielsen in time to avert the collision, but that this did not happen could only be put down to random chance.</p><figure><figcaption>One of the 757’s engines came to rest in this cornfield, totally flattened by the force of the impact. (BFU)</figcaption></figure><p id="1068">Although Nielsen didn’t hear the 757’s “TCAS descent” call, it was recorded on the CVR of the Tupolev, and yet none of her crewmembers reacted either. Investigators theorized that amid the animated conversation and high stress levels in the Tupolev cockpit, the pilots simply didn’t hear it. This was the only communication which occurred between ATC and the 757 during the entire time the Tupolev was in Zürich airspace, hence there was no other opportunity for the crew to hear what the 757 was doing.</p><p id="1829">The BFU also noted that a misleading cue from the controller could have convinced the crew that descending was indeed the only way to avoid the collision. When Nielsen reported that the crossing traffic was at flight level 360 — that is, 36,000 feet — it was actually passing through 35,600 feet and descending rapidly. By placing it at 360, he put it above the Tupolev, which had already begun its own descent a few seconds earlier, when it was actually slightly below. This discrepancy occurred because Nielsen’s radar display only updated once every 12 seconds, and was still showing the 757 at 35,900 feet when he issued the transmission, rendering him unaware that it was descending.</p><figure><figcaption>An aerial view of the Tu-154’s tail section. (Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives)</figcaption></figure><p id="658a">Based on statements made on both cockpit voice recordings, it appeared that both crews were able to visually locate the other aircraft from an early stage, and in the case of the Tupolev this occurred even before the resolution advisory was issued. The blinking anti-collision lights against the moonless sky were in fact quite easy to see, even from a great distance, but judging the relative height of the planes and their future trajectories under such conditions was completely impossible. The human brain relies on points of reference to determine an object’s relative motion, but the conditions that night presented none. Only in the last few seconds before the collision would the planes have been large enough in the field of view for their respective crews to have understood their relative positions. Consequently, both crews did take evasive actions about two or three seconds before impact, but by then it was too late for their inputs to take effect.</p><figure><figcaption>The Tupolev’s tail came to rest across a rural road. (Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives)</figcaption></figure><p id="1cc0">Considering these facts, it could not be said that either crew was in a good position to avoid the other plane, either by visually anticipating a collision or by understanding the situation through overheard ATC communications. The more important question, therefore, was why the Tupolev pilots chose to obey ATC over their TCAS.</p><p id="c72c">In fact, this decision was deeply rooted in both the history of TCAS and the unique circumstances of aviation in Russia. It was a decision born not of faulty judgment, but of a fundamental cultural misunderstanding between the Russian crew and the Western engineers and regulators who designed the TCAS and then mandated its use.</p><p id="df11">Although traffic collision avoidance systems had been required in the United States since 1993 and in the European Union and the Middle East since 2000, at the time of the accident they were not required in Russia. In fact, the only reason the accident Tu-154 even had a TCAS was so that it could fly to destinations in Europe — after all, back home in Russia, where most traffic wasn’t equipped with the system, it would have been of little use. Training on the system was therefore quite sparse. Bashkirian Airlines didn’t have access to a Tu-154 simulator equipped with TCAS, and it’s not clear such a thing even existed. In the absence of an appropriately outfitted simulator, the pilots only received theoretical training on TCAS, followed by a brief demonstration of the system in a plane parked on the ground. Furthermore, the pilots gained minimal TCAS experience in the line of duty because they rarely flew to Europe — in fact, so far in 2002 the two captains put together had a mere 16 flights into airspace where TCAS was active. They almost certainly had never encountered so much as a TCAS traffic alert, let alone a full-on resolution advisory, and this would have been their first time responding to one, either in training or in real life.</p><figure><figcaption>The crash site of the 757. (Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives)</figcaption></figure><p id="930c">In addition to their unfamiliarity with the system, the airline’s Tu-154 operating manual contained language which contradicted that used by the manufacturer and undermined the very purpose of TCAS. As it was conceived in America, TCAS is a last line of defense, a surefire way to prevent a collision if the principles of air traffic control and “see and avoid” should prove inadequate. As such, there is no circumstance under which a TCAS resolution advisory should be disregarded, as its very activation implies that other means of collision avoidance have already failed. In fact, guidance issued by the US Federal Aviation Administration explicitly stated that a TCAS resolution advisory overrides even an order from air traffic control. But most everywhere else, the rules were nowhere near as clear-cut. Official guidance from the International Civil Aviation Organization, or ICAO, which signatory nations use to create their own regulations, did not say what to do if TCAS and ATC issued conflicting avoidance instructions. Similarly, European regulations failed to cover this scenario.</p><p id="2f76">But in Russia, the regulations not only lacked clarity, but appeared to directly contradict those suggested by ICAO. Notably, the Bashkirian Airlines Tu-154 operating manual said the following: <em>“For the avoidance of in-flight collisions … the visual control of the situation in the airspace by the crew and the correct execution of all instructions issued by ATC [is] to be regarded as the most important tool. TCAS is an additional instrument which ensures the timely determination of oncoming traffic, the classification of the risk and, if necessary, planning of an advice for a vertical avoidance manoeuvre.”</em> And after minimizing the importance of TCAS as a last line of defense, the manual went on to say, <em>“The ATC service [is] to be the basic system for the collision avoidance. Nevertheless, in case of no link with ATC, the TCAS will help the crew avoid a collision,” </em>implying that TCAS only needs to be followed in the absence of input from ATC. This advice was in line with the policies that existed under the Soviet Union, when controllers wielded a level of absolute authority that they never held in the West, but it did not correspond well to modern principles of traffic separation.</p><figure><figcaption>The damage to the 757’s tail where it struck the Tupolev. (BFU)</figcaption></figure><p id="6ad7">In practice, the idea that anything can override a TCAS resolution advisory defeats the purpose of the system, which is to prevent a collision after all other means of safe separation are exhausted. But the pilots of the Tu-154 certainly never considered it this way, and in their minds there would have been little ambiguity as to the precedence of Nielsen’s command to descend over the TCAS instruction to climb. This logic would have fallen apart had they recalled that TCAS would send an opposite instruction to the other plane, but their experience with the system was so limited that they probably forgot. First Officer Itkulov, who repeatedly called attention to the TCAS order to climb, may have remembered this fact, but he never clearly articulated it, and no one listened to him anyway.</p><p id="a2cf">It is also worth noting that the ATC order, unlike the TCAS resolution advisory, corresponded to the pilots’ conception of the way traffic conflicts are typically resolved in Russia. While the airplane on the left is expected to give way under Western right-of-way rules, Russian rules hold that both planes must change course, with the plane on the left — the 757 — climbing, while the plane on the right — the Tupolev — descends. In a TCAS environment, right of way is not very meaningful, but for these pilots it would have been the acting principle during 95% of their careers, and it would have reinforced the apparent correctness of Nielsen’s order.</p><figure><figcaption>One of the Tupolev’s wings came to rest in front of this house. (BFU)</figcaption></figure><p id="09a6">It was now apparent why the Tupolev pilots made their decision, and that this decision was entirely in line with their training. The largest remaining question then was why Peter Nielsen allowed the situation to escalate to the point of TCAS becoming involved in the first place.</p><p id="9189">The roots of Nielsen’s predicament go back to the very structure of the Swiss air traffic control system. For most of history, Switzerland’s air traffic control services were run by the state, but in 2001 this service was privatized, becoming an independent company known as Skyguide. Although the government still owned 99% of the shares in Skyguide, it did not receive government funding and was expected to support itself financially through contracts. This reorganization came at a time when air traffic controllers were in high demand across Europe due to an estimated 12% continent-wide shortfall in ATC personnel. Consequently, in the year before the accident, the number of controllers on duty in Zürich during the night shift was reduced from three to two.</p><p id="fd75">Back when three controllers were present, it had become common practice for one controller to take an extended break during the middle of the night. This habit was not officially sanctioned but had been tolerated by management for years. But when the standard night shift roster was reduced to two controllers, this practice continued, even though it left just one controller on duty through the middle of the night shift. This violated Skyguide rules, which required separate controllers to work the approach and upper sectors, but given that all nearby airports were closed to landing traffic by 23:00, no one seemed to think it would be a big problem if there wasn’t a dedicated approach controller during this time of night.</p><figure><figcaption>Part of the center fuselage section also fell near that same house. (BFU)</figcaption></figure><p id="4d9b">Most of the time, the workload at night was low enough that one controller could handle it without difficulty, and Peter Nielsen had become accustomed to this arrangement. But the addition of the maintenance work significantly increased his workload by disabling systems that would normally assist him with his duties. In combination with the unexpected arrival of the Aero Lloyd flight to Friedrichshafen, this directly contributed to the accident. Under normal circumstances, it would have been easy enough for Nielsen to call the Friedrichshafen tower to hand over control of the Aero Lloyd flight, then return his attention to the upper sector. But with the direct phone lines down, he and his assistant had to search for alternative means of communication, which occupied his attention for the first three out of the five minutes leading up to the collision. However, calling the approach controller, who was likely asleep in another part of the building, would have been even less efficient.</p><p id="4cd1">It also could not be ignored that the optical Short-Term Conflict Alert, which would normally have drawn his attention to the developing situation, was not working due to the disconnection of the main computer. And on top of this, the fact that the planes would cross paths in between scheduled waypoints meant that it was not obvious that their flight plans would conflict until the planes began to visibly converge on radar.</p><figure><figcaption>Another view of the Tu-154’s tail section. (Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives)</figcaption></figure><p id="358a">By the time Nielsen noticed the conflict, the planes were already closer together than the minimum allowed by regulations, and even if he had successfully averted the collision at that moment, this fact alone meant there would probably have been an investigation. At this point, he decided to contact the plane to which he had spoken most recently, which was the Tupolev, and because its flight plan showed it was scheduled to do so soon anyway, he chose to instruct it to descend. These spur of the moment decisions planted the seeds of disaster, but Nielsen had no way of predicting the confusion his order would cause. The TCAS resolution advisories had not yet been issued, nor could he have been aware that they would be issued less than one second after the end of his transmission. Although controllers are prohibited from issuing instructions which contradict a TCAS resolution advisory, the pilots must tell the controller about the advisory before this rule is applicable, and neither crew did so until much later.</p><figure><figcaption>The 757’s other engine came to rest in a different field. (BFU)</figcaption></figure><p id="465d">Once the Tu-154 crew had acknowledged his instructions to descend, Nielsen believed that the conflict was resolved. If he had watched the radar screen a few seconds longer, he would have noticed the 757 begin to descend as well, but before he could do so, the Aero Lloyd flight called him again. He spent the next 30 seconds or so informing this flight how to contact Friedrichshafen without an official control handover having taken place. Around the time that this conversation began, an aural alert sounded in the control center, calling out “CONFLICT, CONFLICT,” to warn that the distance between the planes was less than 6.5 nautical miles. However, no one present in the room could recall hearing the alarm, and even if Nielsen had noticed it, he would have disregarded it, believing that he had already put the planes on course to correct the situation.</p><p id="38df">Almost concurrently with these events, the 757’s first officer called to report that they were in a TCAS descent, but because he was at a different work station talking to a different plane, Nielsen didn’t hear the transmission. At that point, disaster became all but inevitable. In fact, by the time Nielsen next turned his attention back to the upper sector, the collision had already taken place. Just 50 seconds had passed since his first instruction to the Tupolev.</p><figure><figcaption>The tail section partially burned over both before and after impact. (BFU)</figcaption></figure><p id="0dfd">One final chance to prevent the collision was also foiled by the maintenance work. Heartbreakingly, controllers in neighboring Karlsruhe saw the collision coming, but they did not have the authority to speak to planes in another sector without permission from the responsible controller. The Karlsruhe controllers tried several times to call Nielsen in the minute before the crash, but the landlines were down and they couldn’t get through. By the time they gave up on this effort, it was too late to prevent the crash even by breaking the rules. The controllers were forced to watch, helpless, as the two planes collided and then disappeared from radar, knowing that dozens of people were dying before their eyes, and that there was nothing they could do to save them.</p><figure><figcaption>The Tupolev’s severed left wing landed in yet another field. (BFU)</figcaption></figure><p id="f0fd">Having already absolved the two crews of blame, the BFU was forced to conclude that Nielsen didn’t hold any personal responsibility for the disaster either — every decision he made was relatively sensible under the circumstances, with the exception of his mistaken report that the 757 was at the Tupolev’s 2:00 position. However, this slip-up did not contribute to the accident, since the Tu-154 crew already had the 757 in sight.</p><p id="6d0c">In the end, systemic deficiencies at the Zürich control center prevented Nielsen from doing his job safely and led more or less directly to the disaster. Skyguide had come to tolerate single-controller operations without conducting any risk assessment, believing that the practice was common throughout Europe. Skyguide also did not assess the potential risks involved in the maintenance work, and it failed to inform controllers of the work’s potential side effects. It was this apparent lack of interest in safety which created the circumstances for the accident to occur. That night, Nielsen was doing the jobs of three people — supervisor, upper sector controller, and approach controller — with inadequate information and multiple inoperative systems. Such a situation should never be allowed to develop, and Skyguide ultimately bore responsibility for the fact that it did.</p><figure><figcaption>A diagram of the 2001 Japan Airlines mid-air incident. (ARAIC Japan)</figcaption></figure><p id="80f9">In its final report on the accident, the BFU painted a picture of a series of wild coincidences which, in the presence of systemic deficiencies, led to disaster. But to come away from the report believing that the Überlingen collision was a one-off would be incorrect. In fact, the lack of clarity in many parts of the world about the relative authority of an ATC order and a TCAS resolution advisory was already known to the industry. In January 2001, this very same loophole nearly led to what would have been the worst air disaster of all time. As a Japan Airlines Boeing 747 with 427 people on board climbed toward 39,000 feet after takeoff from Tokyo, an overwhelmed trainee controller allowed it to embark on a collision course with another Japan Airlines flight, a DC-10 carrying 250 passengers and crew. As the planes drew near each other, the controller instructed the 747 to descend, but three seconds later, its TCAS instructed it to climb.</p><p id="e0d0">Trusting the controller over the automated system, the pilots of the 747 put their plane into a descent, unaware that the DC-10, having received a TCAS advisory to descend, was doing the same. Amid the confusion, the trainee controller’s supervisor attempted to order the 747 to climb, but her transmission was lost in the chaos of the moment. As the two planes descended directly toward each other, the crew of the 747 suddenly caught sight of the DC-10 and executed a last-second evasive maneuver, pitching steeply downward in a desperate effort to avoid a collision. Seconds later, the 747 passed just 135 meters underneath the DC-10, avoiding disaster, but only by the narrowest of margins.</p><figure><figcaption>This drinks cart was thrown into the 747’s attic during the avoidance maneuver. (ARAIC Japan)</figcaption></figure><p id="efae">The evasive maneuver was so abrupt that flight attendants, passengers, and loose objects were thrown into the ceiling, only to crash down again two seconds later. The violent change in direction injured 100 people, nine of them seriously, including a woman who suffered a broken leg. Damage to the cabin interior, particularly the ceiling, was extensive; most notably, a drinks cart, shown above, was thrown through the cabin ceiling and into the attic behind the first class lounge, where it remained for the rest of the flight. In the end, the 747 safely returned to Tokyo, and the injured passengers were released for medical treatment, many of them unaware that they had come frighteningly close to death.</p><figure><figcaption>An artist’s impression of the near miss, by Wikimedia user Anynobody.</figcaption></figure><p id="0c6f">Within a short time after the near miss, it became apparent that one plane had obeyed its TCAS while the other followed a conflicting instruction from ATC. The potential danger of this type of misunderstanding should have been plainly apparent. But by the time of the Überlingen disaster 17 months later, nothing had fundamentally changed.</p><p id="e308">Part of the problem was that the system by which such changes make their way around the world is very slow-moving. Japanese investigators would have had to issue a recommendation to the International Civil Aviation Organization; ICAO would then have had to adopt the new guidance; this guidance would have to have been propagated to signatory nations; those nations would have had to agree to adopt the new wording into their own regulatory systems; and then the new concept would have had to be passed on to pilots during recurrent training. Even if ICAO had immediately begun proceedings to clarify the relative precedence of TCAS resolution advisories and ATC commands (which it does not seem they did), it’s not clear that the changes would have reached the Bashkirian Airlines crew in time to prevent the accident. This is especially true considering that Russia’s TCAS-related regulations already diverged even from the original, flawed ICAO guidance, suggesting that bringing Russian rules into compliance would be quite difficult. On the other hand, had the two Japanese airliners actually collided, almost assuredly resulting in the deaths of an unprecedented 677 people, it’s quite likely that no one would ever make the same mistake again, even if ICAO did nothing. In this way, it becomes apparent how fatal accidents command much swifter change than near misses even in the absence of any conscious decision by regulators to treat them as such.</p><figure><figcaption>Part of the Tu-154’s landing gear fairing which was ripped off during the collision. (BFU)</figcaption></figure><p id="fa5c">In the years since the disaster over Überlingen, prescribed responses to TCAS resolution advisories have been standardized around the world, systems have been introduced which can alert controllers directly whenever a resolution advisory is issued to an aircraft, and TCAS is now capable of reversing its commands if one aircraft does not comply. Thanks to these changes, it is unlikely that a similar accident will happen again. And 20 years later, the Überlingen disaster remains the only major midair collision involving two planes with properly operating traffic collision avoidance systems.</p><p id="6a42">On the legal side, fault for the accident was officially placed on Skyguide, and several Skyguide officials were charged with manslaughter. Although they were found guilty, no real punishment was handed down — three Skyguide managers who tolerated rule violations were given suspended prison sentences, while a fourth was ordered to pay a small fine, a judgment widely considered inadequate. However, the company itself was forced to pay compensation to the victims and take corrective actions to improve its safety culture. It has managed Swiss airspace without incident ever since, as a vase of white flowers in memory of the victims permanently watches over the work station where Peter Nielsen once sat, forever reminding controllers of their responsibility to the public.</p><p id="9cc5">And the story of the Überlingen disaster should have ended there, with the necessary changes having been made to ensure the safety of future air travelers. But in fact, one tragic twist remained in store.</p><figure><figcaption>Vitaly Kaloyev at the memorial to his wife and kids.</figcaption></figure><p id="f4e8">◊◊◊</p><p id="55a3">Vitaly Kaloyev, the Russian architect, was waiting for his family in the airport in Barcelona when he received the unimaginable news: their plane had crashed, and there were no survivors. Stunned by the loss of his wife and two young children, Kaloyev immediately traveled to Germany, where he arrived in Überlingen the day after the accident. Consumed by grief, he joined the search for the remains of his four-year-old daughter Diana, against the recommendation of authorities. By some stroke of luck, her body was found intact, lying on the forest floor beside the pearl necklace Kaloyev had given to her. She was the youngest of the 71 victims, not even old enough to begin school. It seemed beyond cruel that she should lie dead in a forest in Germany while her bereaved father wept over her lifeless body.</p><figure><figcaption>Vitaly Kaloyev, right, confronts the CEO of Skyguide, left. (Keystone)</figcaption></figure><p id="7a20">Kaloyev subsequently returned to his native Vladikavkaz, where he buried his wife and children side by side and erected a sprawling shrine to their memory. It is never easy to move on from such a profound grief, but Kaloyev found it especially difficult. He could be found lingering by the memorial at any time of day and in any weather, for months on end. He barely slept or ate, and how could he? Everything which gave his life meaning had been taken away.</p><p id="0613">As the events which led to the crash started to become clear, Kaloyev became fixated on a singular goal: to convince Skyguide to apologize for its role in the accident. He attended gatherings of victims’ relatives and press conferences in Germany, where he confronted Skyguide officials and demanded that they apologize. But Skyguide, embroiled in lawsuits over the accident, had instructed its spokespeople not to admit any fault until a verdict had been handed down. Instead, the company offered him a total of 160,000 Swiss francs in compensation for his loss, on the condition that he refrain from any lawsuits. This is standard procedure in the West, and Europeans and Americans tend to respond to the practice by rolling their eyes, muttering obscenities about the company in question, and then suing to increase the payout. But in the cultures of the North Caucasus, there is an expectation that such a high-stakes dispute will end with either an admission of guilt and a request for forgiveness, or with justified revenge by the injured party. Not only would a failure to apologize be considered a damnable provocation, but the failure of the injured party to respond proportionately would be considered a dereliction of his duty as a man.</p><figure><figcaption>Vitaly Kaloyev and his family’s grave. (The Los Angeles Times)</figcaption></figure><p id="163b">Kaloyev soon changed course and asked instead if it would be possible to meet Peter Nielsen, to speak with him and convince him to apologize instead. But this too was denied — Nielsen was in no fit state to speak to the unstable relative of a Überlingen victim. And so Kaloyev drifted back and forth between Germany and Vladikavkaz, growing progressively angrier as the legal proceedings dragged on without any conclusion. Many in Russia felt that the slow pace of justice amounted to a coverup, and Kaloyev agreed. This was another cultural misunderstanding — in Russia, following an accident, everyone involved is usually arrested immediately and then released if they are not found at fault. In contrast, Western nations don’t typically arrest aviation professionals for making mistakes, unless gross negligence can be demonstrated, and company officials will only be charged after lengthy investigations. Kaloyev, however, had no patience for this lenient approach, and in late 2003 or early 2004, he decided to take matters into his own hands.</p><figure><figcaption>An undated photo of a young Peter Nielsen. (Lars Lindskov)</figcaption></figure><p id="d4a5">Having hired a private investigator to find Peter Nielsen’s address, Kaloyev arrived in Zürich in February 2004 and checked into a hotel. A few days later, on the 24th of February, he traveled to Nielsen’s house, armed with a 22-centimeter jack knife and photographs of his dead family members.</p><p id="fdd0">Initially, Kaloyev sat down in Nielsen’s garden, seemingly unsure what to do. When Nielsen eventually emerged to investigate, he did not respond kindly to the presence of Kaloyev on his property. Nielsen had been affected deeply by the crash, to the point where he required medical treatment for acute PTSD, and this unexpected visitation only rubbed salt in his wounds. A brief, unfriendly conversation ensued. Kaloyev then got up in Nielsen’s face and showed him the photos of the bodies of his children. Backed into a corner, Nielsen pushed them aside. It was at that moment that Kaloyev apparently snapped: blinded by rage, he stabbed Nielsen several times in the chest, mortally wounding him. He then ran away down the street, blood still dripping from his reddened hands, as Nielsen died in the arms of his family.</p><p id="ff3e">The following day, police arrested Kaloyev in his hotel room and charged him with premeditated killing. Public reactions to the revelation of the murder varied significantly. Europeans were largely outraged, while the response within Russia was much more mixed. Many people, while denouncing the murder, nevertheless sympathized with Kaloyev’s plight. A significant minority outright endorsed the killing, which drew heated condemnation from the other side, including from another man who also lost his entire family in the crash, who said he could see no justification for Kaloyev’s actions.</p><figure><figcaption>Vitaly Kaloyev speaks to reporters after his release from prison. (AFP)</figcaption></figure><p id="a7ae">In court, Kaloyev initially denied intending to kill Nielsen, but could not explain why he had brought the knife if his only goal was to talk. Later, he expressed no remorse for the murder, which he considered to be justified under his North Caucasus code of honor. In the end, a Swiss court, considering the mitigating circumstances, sentenced him to eight years for manslaughter. Even this relatively light sentence was seen by many Russians as too harsh, and the government began to put pressure on its Swiss counterpart to reduce the punishment. Switzerland ultimately caved under the pressure, and Kaloyev was released from prison without a clear explanation in 2007, having served only two years out of his eight year sentence.</p><figure><figcaption>A large crowd of reporters and well-wishers welcomed Kaloyev back home to Vladikavkaz.

Although Russians overall were split on whether he was a hero or a criminal, his home province did not hesitate to pull out all the stops to celebrate his release. People cheered for him in the streets and stores refused to take his money when he shopped for groceries. Journalists selected him as Vladikavkaz’s “Man of 2007,” and the leader of North Ossetia-Alania appointed him Deputy Construction Minister for the autonomous republic. “<em>I don’t really take offense at people who call me a murderer,</em>” Kaloyev told the Los Angeles Times upon his return. “<em>People who say that would betray their own children, their own motherland… I protected the honor of my children and the memory of my children.”</em></p><figure><figcaption>Victims’ family members gather around the Tupolev’s tail after the crash. (AFP)</figcaption></figure><p id="88c4">All of this fanfare ignored the fact that Nielsen was never found at fault in the accident in the first place. As Russian nationalists hailed Kaloyev as a hero for carrying out “justice” on behalf of the victims, few could explain what Nielsen had actually done wrong, besides issuing a relatively late warning to the Tupolev crew. The way this particular segment of Russian society reacted to the crash and the murder was an ugly reflection of a national tendency to blame whoever happens to be present at the moment of a tragedy, while those responsible for creating the unsafe condition go unnamed and unpunished.</p><p id="7196">No doubt buoyed by his celebrity status, Kaloyev eventually recovered from his crippling grief, remarried, and had two more children, who are both three years old as of this writing. He retired from his post as Deputy Construction Minister in 2016, but he continues to live a fairly comfortable life in Vladikavkaz. In contrast, Nielsen’s family, hurt beyond words by Kaloyev’s callous and misguided revenge, returned to their native Denmark and retreated from the public eye.</p><figure><figcaption>A memorial near the site of the crash evokes the pearl necklace which belonged to Diana Kaloyeva.

It is also a reminder that cultural norms play as much of a role in aviation safety as they do in our perception of justice. As the two planes sped toward each other that night, a sequence of events took place in which eight people in three different locations all tried to avert disaster as best they could, only for their divergent expectations to steer them inexorably into the jaws of catastrophe. And as so often seems to happen, the most innocent among us paid the price, leaving in their wake a trail of broken dreams and broken families. Shedding more blood did not and cannot make those dreams whole again. They have vanished with the children of Ufa, like so many tears in the rain.</p><p id="6030">_____________________________________________________________</p><p id="7a57"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CatastrophicFailure/comments/sqsjf5/the_crash_of_bashkirian_airlines_flight_2937_and/?" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Join the discussion of this article on Reddit!</a></p><p id="bb9a">Visit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AdmiralCloudberg/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">r/admiralcloudberg</a> to read and discuss over 200 similar articles.</p><p id="5c8a">You can also <a href="https://www.patreon.com/Admiral_Cloudberg" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">support me on Patreon.</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

   <p>Law enforcement officers in Kansas raided the office of a local newspaper and a journalist's home on Friday, prompting outrage over what First Amendment experts are calling a likely violation of federal law. </p>   <p>The police department in Marion, Kansas — a town of about 2,000 — raided the <em>Marion County Record</em> under a search warrant signed by a county judge. Officers confiscated computers, cellphones, reporting materials and other items essential to the weekly paper's operations. </p>   <p>"It took them several hours," Eric Meyer, the <em>Marion County Record</em>'s co-owner and publisher, told NPR. "They forbid our staff to come into the newspaper office during that time."</p>   
   <p>Local authorities said they were investigating the newsroom for "identity theft," according to the warrant. The raid was linked to alleged violations of a local restaurant owner's privacy, when journalists obtained information about her driving record. </p>   <h3>Publisher says raid contributed to his mother's death</h3>   <p>Meyer's mother, Joan Meyer, collapsed and died one day after police raided her home, the <a href="http://marionrecord.com/direct/updated_illegal_raids_contribute_to_death_of_newspaper_co_owner+5447raid+555044415445443a20496c6c6567616c20726169647320636f6e7472696275746520746f206465617468206f66206e657773706170657220636f2d6f776e65723c212d2d2d2d3e?">Record reported</a> in an update. She was the newspaper's co-owner.</p>   <p>Joan Meyer was 98 and was "otherwise in good health for her age," the newspaper said. But, it added, she had been unable to eat or sleep after police entered her home Friday under a search warrant.</p>   <p>Joan Meyer "tearfully watched during the raid as police not only carted away her computer and a router used by an Alexa smart speaker but also dug through her son Eric's personal bank and investments statements to photograph them," according to the <em>Record</em>.</p>   <p>Without the devices, she was left unable to stream shows onto her TV or use devices if she needed help, the newspaper said. It also alleged that during the police operation, officers seized a number of devices that went beyond the search warrant's scope and were unrelated to their apparent investigation.</p>   <p>Officers came to Meyer's home around the same time police seized computers, cellphones and other equipment during a search of the <em>Record's</em> offices. </p>   
   <p>Another injury occurred, the newspaper said, when police chief Gideon Cody "forcibly grabbed" a cellphone from reporter Deb Gruver, alleging that the act injured Gruver's finger that had previously been dislocated.</p>   <h3>The raid appears to violate federal law</h3>   <p>Newsroom raids are rare in the United States, said Lynn Oberlander, a First Amendment attorney.</p>   <p>"It's very rare because it's illegal," Oberlander said. "It doesn't happen very often because most organizations understand that it's illegal."</p>

   <p>Several media law experts told NPR the raid appears to be a violation of federal law, which protects journalists from this type of action. The Privacy Protection Act of 1980 broadly prohibits law enforcement officials from searching for or seizing information from reporters. </p>   <p>Oberlander said exceptions to the Privacy Protection Act are "important but very limited." </p>   <p>One such exception allows authorities to raid a newsroom if the journalists themselves are suspected to be involved in the crime at hand. In a statement sent to NPR, Marion Police Chief Gideon Cody cited this exception to justify his department's raid of the <em>Marion County Record</em>. </p>   <p>"It is true that in most cases, [the Privacy Protection Act] requires police to use subpoenas, rather than search warrants, to search the premises of journalists unless they themselves are suspects in the offense that is the subject of the search," Cody said.</p>   <p>But Oberlander said that exception doesn't apply when the alleged crime is connected to newsgathering — which appears to be the case in Marion. </p>   <p>"It raises concern for me," Oberlander said. "It normalizes something that shouldn't be happening — that Congress has said should not happen, that the First Amendment says should not happen."</p>

   <p>Ken White, a First Amendment litigator, said police raids of newsrooms used to be more common in the U.S., which led Congress to bolster federal protections against such searches.</p>   <p>White said the police raid of the <em>Marion County Record</em> could also be a violation of the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from "unreasonable" searches and seizures by the government. The search warrant in Marion, signed by county magistrate judge Laura Viar on Friday morning, allowed officers to confiscate a wide range of items, from computers and hardware to reporting documents. </p>   
   <p>"It's an abuse of power by the police and it's a serious dereliction of duty by the judge who signed off on it," White said.  </p>   <p>Viar could not immediately be reached for comment. </p>   <h3>Identity theft allegations</h3>   <div id="res1193676145">

   <p>Meyer, the <em>Marion County Record</em>'s publisher, said local restaurateur Kari Newell accused the paper of illegally obtaining drunk-driving records about her. </p>   <p>But the paper, Meyer said, received this information about Newell from a separate source, independently verified it on the Kansas Department of Revenue's Division of Vehicles website — and decided not to publish it. The paper instead opted to notify local police. </p>   <p>The search warrant, as published by the <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2023/08/11/police-stage-chilling-raid-on-marion-county-newspaper-seizing-computers-records-and-cellphones/">Kansas Reflector</a> and verified by the police chief, specifically allowed officers to confiscate documents and records pertaining to "the identity theft of Kari Newell." The warrant also ties the search to "unlawful acts concerning computers" that were used to access the Kansas Department of Revenue records website.</p>   <p>"We never attempted to steal anyone's identity," Meyer said. </p>   <p>Jeff Kosseff, a law professor at the United States Naval Academy who specializes in the First Amendment, said he was surprised the county judge found there was sufficient probable cause to sign off on the search warrant. Kosseff said there would need to be "a whole lot more for this to be a correct decision."</p>   <p>"I can't imagine a scenario in which all of these other protections would be overcome to allow a raid on a newsroom," Kosseff said, referencing the First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment and the Privacy Protection Act. "This raid has been more than just potentially compromising sources. This has threatened the ability of the newsroom to operate altogether — and that's why we have these protections."</p>   <p>James Risen, former director of the Press Freedom Defense Fund, called the raid an "outrageous abuse of power by the local authorities." </p>   
   <p>Risen said all authorities involved in the raid should be investigated for carrying it out. </p>   <p>"There's lots of precedent for bad behavior of local officials against the press," Risen said. "In each case, it has to be called out and stopped if we're going to protect the First Amendment in this country."</p>   <p>Meyer said the confiscation of the paper's computers and phones makes it difficult to continue operations — but the paper, which has five full-time staffers, still plans to publish its weekly edition this Wednesday.</p>   <p>And, Meyer added, he's working with an attorney to challenge the police's right to inspect the items they confiscated.</p>   <p>"We cannot let this stand. They cannot put us out of business over this," Meyer said. "That just is too bad of a precedent to set for the United States, to allow anything like that to happen."</p>   <p><em>Emily Olson contributed reporting.</em></p>

  <section><p>Joan Meyer, the 98-year-old co-owner of a small Kansas newspaper, collapsed and died at her home on Saturday, a day after police raided her home and the <a href="http://marionrecord.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Marion County Record</a>'s office, the newspaper said. Meyer had been "stressed beyond her limits and overwhelmed by hours of shock and grief," the Record said, calling the raids illegal.</p><p>Marion Police Chief Gideon Cody on Saturday defended the raid and said that once all the information is available, "the judicial system that is being questioned will be vindicated." Police have not shared an update since Meyer's death was announced.</p><p>Police took Meyer's computer and a router used by an Alexa smart speaker during the raid at her home, according to the paper. Officers at the Record's office seized personal cellphones, computers, the newspaper's file server and other equipment. Cody also allegedly forcibly grabbed reporter Deb Gruver's cellphone, injuring a finger that had previously been dislocated.</p>    
  <p>"Our first priority is to be able to publish next week," publisher Eric Meyer said. "But we also want to make sure no other news organization is ever exposed to the Gestapo tactics we witnessed today. We will be seeking the maximum sanctions possible under law."</p><p>The federal <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-661-privacy-protection-act-1980" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Privacy Protection Act</a> protects journalists and newsrooms from most searches by law enforcement, requiring police usually to issue subpoenas rather than search warrants.&nbsp;</p>

    

<p>"It is true that in most cases, it requires police to use subpoenas, rather than search warrants, to search the premises of journalists unless they themselves are suspects in the offense that is the subject of the search," Cody said.&nbsp;</p><p>Friday's raid was conducted on the basis of a search warrant. The search warrant, posted online by the <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2023/08/11/police-stage-chilling-raid-on-marion-county-newspaper-seizing-computers-records-and-cellphones/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kansas Reflector</a>, indicates police were investigating identity theft and unlawful acts concerning computers. It also indicated police were looking for documents and records pertaining to local restauranteur Kari Newell.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the Record, Newell had accused the newspaper of illegally obtaining drunk driving information about Newell and supplying it to Marion Councilwoman <a href="https://www.marionks.net/people/ruth-herbel" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ruth Herbel</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"The Record did not seek out the information," the newspaper wrote. "Rather, it was provided by a source who sent it to the newspaper via social media and also sent it to Herbel."</p>

    
    

<p>The Record verified the information about Newell through public records but did not plan to publish it, believing that the information had "been intentionally leaked to the newspaper as part of legal sparring between Newell and her estranged husband," the paper wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>"The victim asks that we do all the law allows to ensure justice is served," Cody said. "The Marion Kansas Police Department will [do] nothing less."</p><p>The Kansas Bureau of Investigation assisted in the investigation "into allegations of illegal access and dissemination of confidential criminal justice information," the bureau said in a statement.&nbsp;</p><p>"Director Mattivi believes very strongly that freedom of the press is a vanguard of American democracy... But another principle of our free society is equal application of the law," the bureau said, adding, "No one is above the law, whether a public official or a representative of the media."</p><p>Police have fallen under scrutiny due to the search, with free speech advocates expressing concern about its implications.&nbsp;</p><p>The raid appears to have violated federal law and the First Amendment, according to Seth Stern, advocacy director of&nbsp;<a href="https://freedom.press/news/fpf-statement-on-alarming-police-raid-of-kansas-newspaper/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Freedom of the Press Foundation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"This looks like the latest example of American law enforcement officers treating the press in a manner previously associated with authoritarian regimes," Stern said Friday. "The anti-press rhetoric that's become so pervasive in this country has become more than just talk and is creating a dangerous environment for journalists trying to do their jobs."</p>

    
    

<p>PEN America on Saturday said law enforcement should be held accountable for violating the Record's rights.&nbsp;</p><p>"Journalists rely on confidential sources to report on matters of vital public concern," Shannon Jankowski, PEN America's journalism and disinformation program director, said in a statement. "Law enforcement's sweeping raid on The Marion County Record and confiscation of its equipment almost certainly violates federal law and puts the paper's very ability to publish the news in jeopardy."</p>
