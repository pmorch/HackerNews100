<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article id="article-body"><div><p><span>T</span>oday, I am resigning from the National Science Board and the Library of Congress Scholars Council.&nbsp;</p><p>Even as the White House threatens the foundational tenets of <a href="https://time.com/6693684/donald-trump-constitutional-bullying-democracy-threat-president-lawsuit/">constitutional democracy</a> and continues to <a href="https://time.com/7273450/trump-administration-gut-health-institutions/">slash funding</a> for essential social services, it is tempting to hope that the public institutions charged with promoting and protecting knowledge will, nevertheless, soldier on with their mission. I did.&nbsp;</p><p>Since January 2025, scientists and librarians, program officers and policy analysts at the National Science Foundation, the Library of Congress, and other federal offices and agencies have focused on their work, despite an increasingly hostile political environment. We’ve also seen civil servants fired and <a href="https://time.com/7267383/donald-trump-department-education/">accused</a> of not making the mark, vendors’s contracts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/politics/doge-musk-contracts-agencies.html">ignored</a>, and grants and fellowships <a href="https://time.com/7216299/nih-budget-cuts-science-research-funding/">cancelled</a>.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Perseverance has its limits. The erosion of these institutions’ integrity—and the growing realization that it is impossible to fulfill their missions in good faith—has made the cost of continuing untenable. This is why I must step away from my work with two federal institutions I care deeply about. </p><p>In both these roles, over the past few years, I've been asked to serve on diverse bodies that offer guidance about how the Executive and Legislative branches can be stewards of knowledge and create structure to enable discovery, innovation, and ingenuity. In the instance of the National Science Board, this ideal has dissolved so gradually, yet so completely, that I barely noticed its absence until confronted with its hollow simulacrum.</p><p>I have encountered increasing barriers to the exercise of honest counsel. These repeated obstacles of procedural circumvention, particularly insidious to those of us who have long advocated for more democratic and inclusive knowledge systems, represent not just personal frustration, but institutional regression.</p></div><div><p>Freedom of expression is not merely an abstract principle, or even a constitutional right, but a practical necessity for meaningful advisory work. In Ray Bradbury's <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, published as short stories in the late 1940s and as a novel in 1953, warned not only of the destruction of books, but of a society in which people had lost the desire to read them. <a href="https://time.com/7284644/trumps-erasure-of-women/">The parallel today</a> is not only the administration’s <a href="https://time.com/7209261/communications-by-federal-health-agencies-will-be-temporarily-reviewed-by-trump-appointees/">effort</a> to destroy and suppress knowledge, but also the institution’s willingness to accept the cultivated <a href="https://time.com/7209300/trumps-biological-truth-executive-order-is-not-true/">irrelevance</a> of it—a challenge that undermines any serious effort to conduct research, inform policy, or guide public institutions.</p><div><p>The National Science Foundation (NSF)—established as an independent agency through the National Science Act of 1950 and marking its 75th anniversary this week—<a href="https://time.com/7259548/why-government-should-pay-for-university-research-costs/">traces its roots</a> to Vannevar Bush’s landmark <a href="https://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/2023-04/EndlessFrontier75th_w.pdf">report</a>, “Science, the Endless Frontier,” addressed to President Harry S. Truman. But we might also see the establishment of this premier research institution as reflecting a response to fears depicted by Bradbury. The NSF can be understood not only as a catalyst of scientific promise for national purpose, but also as a guarded response to fears about centralized control over knowledge and thought, shaped by the dark shadows of the Third Reich and the emerging Red Scare.</p><p>The NSF’s investments have shaped some of the most transformative technologies of our time—from <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/precious-time">GPS</a> to <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/impacts/internet#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20National%20Science%20Foundation,email%20message%20using%20the%20ARPANET.">the internet</a>—and supported vital research in the social and behavioral sciences that helps the nation understand itself and evaluate its progress toward its democratic ideals. So in 2024, I was honored to be appointed to the National Science Board, which is charged under 42 U.S. Code § 1863 with establishing the policies of the Foundation and providing oversight of its mission. </p></div></div><div><p>But the meaning of oversight changed with the arrival of <a href="https://time.com/7222251/doge-musk-federal-workers-government/">DOGE</a>. That historical tension—between the promise of scientific freedom and the peril of political control—may now be resurfacing in troubling ways. Last month, when a National Science Board <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=311196#:~:text=April%2025%2C%202025,as%20Director%20of%20the%20Foundation.">statement</a> was released on occasion of the April 2025 resignation of Trump-appointed NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan, it was done so without the participation or notice of all members of the Board.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Last week, as the Board held its 494th meeting, I listened to NSF staff say that DOGE had by fiat the authority to give thumbs up or down to grant applications which had been systematically vetted by layers of subject matter experts.</p><p>Our closed-to-the-public deliberations were observed by Zachary Terrell from the DOGE team. Through his Zoom screen, Terrell showed more interest in his water bottle and his cuticles than in the discussion. According to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01312-8"><em>Nature</em></a> Terrell, listed as a "consultant" in the NSF directory, had accessed the NSF awards system to block the dispersal of approved grants. The message I received was that the National Science Board had a role to play in name only. </p></div></div><div><p>This episode reflects a deeper concern: the erosion of meaningful guidance. I was still free to discuss my concerns at the board meeting, but it was increasingly clear that it was just a performance without any impact. The advisory body had been transformed into a ceremonial assemblage. Consultation occurred without consequence. When grant applications are vetoed and whole organizations restructured, the freedom to speak becomes meaningless when disconnected from the possibility of being heard.</p><p>All of this is threatened by the creeping normalization of authoritarian approaches to <a href="https://time.com/6985760/autocrats-weaponize-chaos-essay/">knowledge management</a> and <a href="https://time.com/6969851/academic-freedom-is-more-important-than-ever-now/">academic freedom</a>. The National Science Board has not been disbanded like so many other statutorily established, independent agencies in the federal government. But preservation of form provides little consolation when function has been strategically neutralized, mirroring the backsliding that scholars have thoroughly documented: maintaining legitimacy for institutions that no longer honor their founding purposes. This hollowing out is not just about governance in the abstract, it has material consequences for which research questions get asked, which datasets get produced, which knowledge gets produced, and which perspectives shape our understanding of pressing societal challenges. It has consequences for the integrity of knowledge itself.</p></div><div><p>The second institution from which I am departing is also demonstrating symptoms of democratic decay. In 2023, I was appointed by the Librarian of Congress to the Scholars Council, which advises the Kluge Chairs program, the Kluge Prize for the Study of Humanity, and other library programming intended to get ideas out of the stacks and into society by “reinvigorat[ing] the interconnection between thought and action,” “bridging the divide between knowledge and power,” and “narrow[ing] the gap between thinkers and doers.”</p><p>Last week, the Librarian of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden, was summarily <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/politics/hayden-library-of-congress-dei.html">dismissed</a> via an email addressed to “Carla” from a White House HR administrator. The Trump Administration claimed that she was fired for “things she had done at the Library of Congress in the pursuit of DEI and putting inappropriate books in the library for children.” It is true that Hayden was repeatedly on record as saying the Library should be for <em>all</em> Americans. And it is <a href="https://www.loc.gov/about/frequently-asked-questions/#:~:text=The%20Library%20of%20Congress%20is%20a%20research%20library%2C%20and%20books,with%20a%20photo%20on%20it.">false</a> that the Library, which is intended to hold <em>all</em> books published in the United States, lends books to <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/05/09/congress/trump-carla-hayden-firing-congress-00340034">children</a>. The ouster of Hayden is part of a broader pattern of political targeting of women and Black public servants across the federal government.</p></div><div><p>Dr. Carla Hayden was a leader in the digitization of libraries and a steadfast advocate for their public mission. Her dismissal signals more than a routine personnel shift—it reflects a deeper contest over who controls the curation and dissemination of knowledge in the digital age. That contest became even more apparent two days later, when the Trump Administration <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/10/trump-u-s-copyright-official-00340306">fired</a> her direct report, Shira Perlmutter, the Register of Copyrights. Perlmutter’s office had just released a <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/ai/Copyright-and-Artificial-Intelligence-Part-3-Generative-AI-Training-Report-Pre-Publication-Version.pdf">report</a> concluding that while generative AI poses novel challenges to copyright law, these could be addressed through voluntary licensing and market-based solutions—rather than statutory changes to the fair use doctrine. At a time when questions about AI and intellectual property are front of <a href="https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/Subtitle_C_Communications_4e3fbcc3bc.pdf?ref=404media.co">mind</a>, the Library of Congress’s oversight of the U.S. copyright system is more consequential than ever.</p><p>The steady accumulation of procedural adjustments, each seemingly minor, stand to systematically and collectively alter the purpose and impact of our institutions. The dismissal of Hayden, who took the helm of the Library of Congress with a vow to extend its resources to <em>all </em>of us, represents not merely a personnel change but a statement about what kind of knowledge stewardship is deemed acceptable.</p></div><div><p>To watch these changes unfold without naming them for what they are is to participate in a collective amnesia about how knowledge infrastructures shape power relations. Like the shopkeeper in an authoritarian society <a href="https://hac.bard.edu/amor-mundi/the-power-of-the-powerless-vaclav-havel-2011-12-23">described</a> by Vaclav Havel in his essay “The Power of the Powerless,” who participates in his own oppression through small daily acts of complicity, placing a party slogan in his window not out of conviction but out of habit. To remain on advisory boards that have been stripped of meaningful advisory function is to become that shopkeeper, to lend legitimacy to a process that has been systematically delegitimized.</p><p>What then, is the responsible course of action? For me, the answer now lies in refusal, the withdrawal of participation from systems that require dishonesty as the price of belonging. My resignation represents such a refusal, not a surrender of responsibility but an assertion of it.</p></div><div><p>This is not to condemn those who remain. There is value in continued presence, in bearing witness, in working for reform from within. But there comes a point when presence itself becomes an endorsement, when working within the system becomes indistinguishable from working for it.</p><p>In her Nobel <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1993/morrison/lecture/">lecture</a> in 1993, the writer Toni Morrison observed:</p><p><em>"Oppressive language does more than represent violence; it is violence; does more than represent the limits of knowledge; it limits knowledge. Whether it is obscuring state language or the faux-language of mindless media; whether it is the proud but calcified language of the academy or the commodity driven language of science; whether it is the malign language of law-without-ethics, or language designed for the estrangement of minorities, hiding its racist plunder in its literary cheek—it must be rejected, altered and exposed."</em></p><p>The aim of my resignation is to break free of powers that seek to limit knowledge and silence voice. To signal that certain boundary lines have been crossed. To insist that advisory roles must expand knowledge and be more than appendages to predetermined decisions.</p></div><p>I follow political economist Albert O. Hirschman, in his seminal <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674276604">work</a> <em>Exit, Voice, and Loyalty</em>, who offered a framework for understanding responses to institutional decline. Exit (leaving) and voice (speaking up) need not be mutually exclusive strategies. My resignations are both, an exit that amplifies the voice of others. By departing these advisory roles, I aim to speak more clearly in my own language about what they have become and what they ought to be. This is not an abandonment of loyalty to these institutions' missions, but rather, its highest expression.</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

    <p>How high is the stress I am talking about? You are commuting all you think is that you might snap today, you might quit today. That is what I am calling a high-stress work environment. You know after a certain point the job becomes disposable and you are making a list in your head of who you are going to say "fuck you" to as you storm out of the building.</p>
<p>The reality in this environment is that everyone is stressed and you are not unique. The person pressing you is being pressed on by another guy. Everyone hates their job and everyone likes the movie "Office Space" daydreaming about quitting and dating Jennifer Aniston, who happens to be beautiful but stupid enough to not see that.</p>
<p>The reality is that if you quit, you DO NEED these connections to get a new job in the form of a recommendation. Do not snap at people. You may think the job is disposable, but the reality is that the memory is not. You will always be "that guy". You will always be the person who said "fuck you" to them, even though you were both in a pile of shit neck-deep.</p>
<p>So, prioritize relationships. If you are doing something, forget about deadlines or significance, think of the other person who is begging you and how it impacts them. Every relationship is a human relationship, so do not let the "professional environment" corrupt that.</p>

Subject: screen: Multiple Security Issues in Screen (mostly affecting release
 5.0.0 and setuid-root installations)

Hello list,

these issues in Screen have been shared with the distros mailing list on
2025-04-30 and publication is due today. We also offer a rendered
version of this report on our blog [1].

1) Introduction
===============

In July 2024, the upstream Screen maintainer asked us [2] if we could
have a look at the current Screen code base. We treated this request
with lower priority, since we already had a cursory look at Screen a few
years earlier, without finding any problems. When we actually found time
to look into it again, we were surprised to find a local root exploit in
the Screen 5.0.0 major version update affecting distributions that ship
it as setuid-root (Arch Linux and NetBSD). We also found a number of
additional, less severe issues that partly also affect older Screen
versions still found in the majority of distributions.

Attached to this email you can find two sets of patches for the issues
described in this report, one for screen-4.9.1 and another for
screen-5.0.0. These patch sets apply against the screen-4.9.1 and
screen-5.0.0 release tarballs, respectively. Due to difficulties in the
communication with upstream we do not currently have detailed
information about bugfixes and releases published on their end.

The next section provides an overview of the Screen configurations and
versions found on common Linux and UNIX distributions. Section 3)
discusses each security issue we discovered in detail. Section 4) takes
a look at possible further issues in Screen's setuid-root
implementation. Section 5) gives general recommendations for the
improvement of Screen's security posture. Section 6) points out problems
we encountered during the coordinated disclosure process for these
issues. Section 7) provides an affectedness matrix which gives a quick
overview of the situation on various Linux and UNIX systems.

2) Overview of Screen Configurations and Versions
=================================================

In August 2024 a version 5.0.0 major release of Screen was published by
upstream. By now Arch Linux, Fedora 42 and NetBSD 10.1 ship this new
version of Screen. A lot of refactoring changes made their way into this
Screen release that are in some cases dating back more than ten years.
Some of the issues discussed in this report have only been introduced in
the 5.0.0 release of Screen, while others also affect Screen 4.9.1 (and
older), which is still the version found in the majority of Linux and
UNIX distributions at the time of writing.

Any source code references in this report are based on the upstream
5.0.0 release tag [3], unless noted otherwise. Affectedness information
is provided for both the current 5.0.0 release and the more widespread
4.9.1 Screen release for each vulnerability discussed below.

NOTE: At the time of writing we often experienced HTTP 502 "Bad Gateway"
errors trying to access Screen's Git web front end. Retrying a few
seconds later usually resolved the error.

About the Screen Multi-User Mode
--------------------------------

Screen offers a multi-user mode which allows to attach to Screen
sessions owned by other users in the system (given the proper
credentials). These multi-user features are only available when Screen
is installed with the setuid-root bit set. This configuration of Screen
results in highly increased attack surface, because of the complex
Screen code that runs with root privileges in this case.

A Screen multi-user session is identified by its name, which needs to
have a `&lt;user&gt;/` prefix. The following command line would create such a
session:

    user1$ screen -S user1/my-multi-user-session

To manage access to a multi-user session, Screen maintains access
control lists (acls) that can be configured in Screen's configuration
file (`~/.screenrc`), or by sending commands to a running Screen session
(see `screen(1)` man page [4]). These acls are based on the account
names of other users and can optionally be protected by a password.
Access can be restricted to "read-only", a mode in which no input can be
passed to the terminal.

Of the systems we looked into, only Arch Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD
install Screen with the setuid-root bit set. On Gentoo Linux the
setuid-root bit is optionally assigned if the "multiuser" USE flag is
set. Some distributions install Screen with a setgid bit assigned to let
it run with specific group credentials. This is the case on Gentoo Linux
by default, which installs Screen as setgid-utmp, allowing Screen to
create login records in the system-wide utmp database. Fedora Linux
installs Screen as setgid-screen, which allows Screen to place sockets
into a system-wide directory in `/run/screen`.

3) Security Issues
==================

3.a) Local Root Exploit via `logfile_reopen()` (CVE-2025-23395)
---------------------------------------------------------------

This issue affects Screen 5.0.0 when it runs with setuid-root
privileges. The function `logfile_reopen()` [5] does not drop privileges
while operating on a user supplied path. This allows unprivileged users
to create files in arbitrary locations with `root` ownership, the
invoking user's (real) group ownership and file mode 0644. All data
written to the Screen PTY will be logged into this file. Also already
existing files can be abused for logging in this manner: the data will
be appended to the file in question, but the file mode and ownership
will be left unchanged.

Screen correctly drops privileges when it initially opens the logfile.
The privilege escalation becomes possible as soon as Screen believes it
is necessary to reopen the logfile. Screen checks this by calling
`stolen_logfile()` [6] before writing to the file. The call to
`logfile_reopen()` happens when the link count of the originally opened
logfile drops to zero, or if it unexpectedly changes in size. This
condition can be triggered at will on the end of the unprivileged user.

This is a reproducer which shows how to achieve a basic local root
exploit on an affected system:

    # create a Screen session using a custom logfile path
    (shell1) user$ screen -Logfile $HOME/screen.log
    # enter the key combination to enable logging to the configured path
    (screen) user$ &lt;ctrl-a&gt; H
    
    # in another shell remove the logfile that Screen just created and
    # replace it by a symlink to a privileged location
    (shell2) user$ rm $HOME/screen.log; ln -s /etc/profile.d/exploit.sh \
        $HOME/screen.log
    
    # back in the Screen session, echo an exploit command which will be logged to
    # the now redirected logfile.
    #
    # This needs to be done via `echo` for adding a leading newline to prevent the
    # bash prompt from breaking the exploit. Similarly the trailing semicolon
    # is necessary to prevent following control characters from becoming part of
    # the shell command.
    (screen) user$ echo -e "\nchown $USER /root;"
    
    # now perform a new login as root and watch the exploit being executed.
    # you will likely see a range of shell errors during login as well.
    root# ls -lhd /root
    drwxr-x--- 5 user root 4.0K Dec 30  2020 .

This is just one naive approach to achieve a local root exploit, which
is not very well hidden (because of strange error messages) and requires
the actual `root` user to login to trigger it. There are likely many
other ways to exploit this, however, for example by writing new
configuration files for tools like `sudo`, or by appending code to
privileged shell scripts found in /usr/bin and similar locations.

### Bugfix

The problem was introduced via an old commit 441bca708bd [7], which has
only now become part of the 5.0.0 release. In this commit the
`lf_secreopen()` function was removed, which was considered unneeded.

Patch 0001 in the attached screen-5.0.0-patches.tar.gz addresses the
issue by reintroducing the secure file handling during logfile reopen.

### Affected Distributions

#### Arch Linux

Arch Linux is fully affected by this issue, since it ships the version
5.0.0 release and assigns the setuid-root bit. Screen is not installed
by default on Arch, however.

#### Fedora Linux

The affected 5.0.0 version is only found in the recently released Fedora
42. Screen runs with setgid-screen credentials there, to be able to
write in the `/run/screen` directory. A private directory with mode 0700
is created in there for each user that runs a Screen multi-user session.
Due to this, the exploit will not allow to write in other users' session
directories, it will only be possible to create files directly in
`/run/screen`. The only attack vector we can imagine here is to cause a
local DoS scenario by claiming the names of other users' session
directories, should they not yet exist. Another attack vector could be
to try and fill up the free disk space of the /run file system (a TMPFS)
to break other system services.

#### Gentoo Linux

Gentoo Linux is not affected in its stable Screen ebuild, which is still
based on Screen version 4.9.1.

When using Gentoo's unstable 'app-misc/screen-9999' ebuild, then the
affected version 5.0.0 will be installed, however. If the "multiuser"
USE flag is also set, then the setuid-root bit will be applied,
resulting in a fully vulnerable Screen.

Without this USE flag, Screen runs as setgid-utmp on Gentoo Linux, which
allows to use this exploit to overwrite the `/var/log/wtmp` database.
This makes it possible to violate the integrity of the database or even
to craft login entries which could adversely influence other privileged
programs in the system that rely on this information.

#### FreeBSD

FreeBSD still uses version 4.9.1. If Screen were to be upgraded to 5.0.0
then FreeBSD would be affected as well, since Screen is installed as
setuid-root by default.

#### NetBSD

On NetBSD the affected Screen 5.0.0 version can be installed and it will
by default run with setuid-root privileges. This makes it fully affected
by the issue.

3.b) TTY Hijacking while Attaching to a Multi-User Session (CVE-2025-46802)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This issue is found in the `Attach()` function when the `multiattach`
flag is set (i.e. Screen attempts to attach to a multi-user session).
The function performs a `chmod()` [8] of the current TTY to mode 0666.
The path to the current TTY is stored in the `attach_tty` string:

    if ((how == MSG_ATTACH || how == MSG_CONT) &amp;&amp; multiattach) {
        /* snip */
        if (chmod(attach_tty, 0666))
            Panic(errno, "chmod %s", attach_tty);
        tty_oldmode = tty_mode;
    }

Fortunately the TTY path which is calculated within Screen is
sufficiently probed for correctness. In particular, `isatty()` needs to
be true for FD 0 (which is used for determining the TTY path) and the
resulting path needs to reside in /dev. Otherwise this `chmod()` would
have led to another local root exploit.

The original TTY mode is restored towards the end of the function in
line 284 [9]. We are not completely sure about the purpose of this
temporary permission change, maybe it is supposed to allow the Screen
daemon of the target session (which might have different credentials) to
access the client's TTY for the purposes of the attach procedure.

The issue with this temporary TTY mode change is that it introduces a
race condition allowing any other user in the system to open the
caller's TTY for reading and writing for a short period of time. We made
some simple tests based on Linux's inotify API, and we managed to open
affected TTYs every second or third attempt using a simple Python script
this way.

The impact of this issue is that an attacker can intercept data typed
into the TTY and also inject data into it. An attacker could attempt to
mislead the owner of the TTY into entering a password, or gain other
sensitive information. Also, control sequences can be injected into the
affected TTY which adds further possibilities to confuse the victim or
to exploit issues in an involved terminal emulator.

There also exist return paths in the `Attach()` function where the
original mode is never restored again. This happens in line 160 [10],
for instance, where the process explicitly exits if the target session
is not found and the "quiet" command line argument has been set. A
simple reproducer of this aspect is as follows:

    # inspect the current TTY permissions, which are safe
    user$ ls -l `tty`
    crw--w---- 1 user tty 136, 1 Feb  5 12:18 /dev/pts/1
    # attempt to attach to some non-existing session of the root user.
    # note that this only works if the target user's session directory (e.g.
    # in $HOME/.screen) already exists, otherwise the logic terminates early
    # and the `chmod()` does not happen.
    user$ screen -r -S root/some-session -q
    # observe the now unsafe TTY permissions
    user$ ls -l `tty`
    crw-rw-rw- 1 user tty 136, 1 Feb  5 12:19 /dev/pts/1

The `Panic()` function, which is mostly used in `Attach()` to stop
process execution, correctly restores the old TTY mode [11]. Only code
paths that use `return` or `eexit()` suffer from this missing TTY mode
restore.

### Bugfix

We assume that the problematic `chmod()` calls are most likely only
remnants of past times, when this insecure approach was used to grant
the target Screen session access to the new client's PTY. These days
Screen passes the PTY file descriptor securely via the UNIX domain
socket to the target session.

Thus to fix this, the temporary `chmod()` to mode 666 can be dropped.
This is what is done in patch 0001 in the attached
screen-4.9.1-patches.tar.gz and patch 0004 in the
screen-5.0.0-patches.tar.gz.

Shortly before the publication of this report it was pointed out to us
that this patch likely breaks some reattach use cases [12] in Screen. We
can confirm this problem, but at the same time found out that this
specific use case was obviously already broken before, even in Screen
4.9.1 [13]. For this reason we decided not to move the publication date
again or to adjust this patch in a hurry with uncertain results. The
patch still fixes the security issue and upstream can now fix this
regression, that already seems to have existed earlier, in the open.

### Affected Distributions

Unlike the previous issue, this one is not limited to the current 5.0.0
release. The observed behaviour has been present in Screen versions
since at least the year 2005. All Linux distributions and BSDs we
checked suffer from this, if they provide multi-user support in Screen
by installing it setuid-root.

This issue theoretically also affects Screen if it is *not* installed
setuid-root, because the caller always has permission to modify the mode
of its own TTY. Screen refuses to continue the operation, however, if
the target session is not owned by the caller and no root privileges are
available. The problematic code still triggers when a user attempts for
some reason to join a multi-user session owned by itself. An example
invocation that leads to this would be `screen -r -S $USER/some-session
-q`. Systems that are affected by this lighter variant of the issue are
marked as partly affected in section 7).

3.c) Screen by Default Creates World Writable PTYs (CVE-2025-46803)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In Screen version 5.0.0 the default mode of pseudo terminals (PTYs)
allocated by Screen was changed from 0620 to 0622, thereby allowing
anyone to write to any Screen PTYs in the system. Security-wise this
results in some of the issues that have been outlined in issue 3.b),
without the information leak aspects, however.

The history of the default PTY mode in Screen is rather complex. Let's
have a look at the situation in version 4.9.1 (and a lot of older
versions):

- There is a 0622 default mode in the code in process.c line 207 [14].
  This is only a fallback that should not become active unless the code
  is compiled in unusual ways.
- A default mode of 0620 is applied in configure.ac line 811 [15], which
  results in a safe default when compiling Screen using autotools.
- In acconfig.h line 81 [16] the following is stated:
  
  &gt; define PTYMODE if you do not like the default of 0622, which allows public write to your pty.
  
  Thus in this version there is an inconsistency between the default
  mode on autoconf level and the default on source code level, but in
  the end the (safe) autoconf default wins.

Now let's look at the situation in Screen version 5.0.0:

- The configure.ac file was rewritten from scratch in commit df1c012227 [17].
  This change drops the 0620 default mode on autoconf level.
- In a follow-up commit 78a961188f7 [18] the pty-mode configure switch
  was reintroduced, this time with default mode 0622.
- Thus in version 5.0.0 there is no longer a mismatch between the source
  code level default and the autoconf level default, but the default is
  now unsafe.

### Bugfix

We couldn't find any Screen release notes for version 5.0.0, except for
a few ChangeLog entries. It seems it was not a deliberate decision to
change the default PTY Mode to 0622.

Patch 0002 in the attached screen-5.0.0-patches.tar.gz addresses the
issue by restoring the safe default PTY mode in the configure.ac script.
Note that you will need to run `autoreconf` to make the change
effective.

We recommend to packagers to actively pass the configure switch
`--with-pty-mode=0620` to make this choice explicit, also on older
releases of Screen.

### Affected Distributions

Gentoo Linux and Fedora Linux pass an explicit safe `--with-pty-mode` to
Screen's configure script. For distributions other than the ones listed
as affected below, we did not check if they are either doing the same,
or if they are relying on the safe default present in older Screen
releases.

#### Arch Linux

On Arch Linux the package build does not pass the `--with-pty-mode`
switch, resulting in the new default being applied, thus making Screen
on current Arch Linux vulnerable to this issue.

#### NetBSD

NetBSD is affected by this issue the same way as Arch Linux is.

3.d) File Existence Tests via Socket Lookup Error Messages (CVE-2025-46804)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a minor information leak when running Screen with setuid-root
privileges that is found in older Screen versions, as well as in version
5.0.0. The code in screen.c starting at line 849 [19] inspects the
resulting `SocketPath` with root privileges, and provides error messages
that allow unprivileged users to deduce information about the path that
would otherwise not be available.

An easy way to achieve this is by using the `SCREENDIR` environment
variable. Following is an example that works on current Arch Linux:

    # this can be used to test whether /root/.lesshst exists and is a regular file
    user$ SCREENDIR=/root/.lesshst screen
    /root/.lesshst is not a directory.
    
    # this allows to deduce that the directory /root/.cache exists
    user$ SCREENDIR=/root/.cache screen
    bind (/root/.cache/1426.pts-0.mgarch): Permission denied
    
    # this tells us that the path /root/test does not exist
    user $ SCREENDIR=/root/test screen
    Cannot access /root/test: No such file or directory

### Bugfix

Patch 0002 in the attached screen-4.9.1-patches.tar.gz and patch 0005 in
the attached screen-5.0.0-patches.tar.gz address the problem by only
outputting generic error messages when Screen is installed setuid-root
and when the target path is not controlled by the real UID of the
process.

### Affected Distributions

All distributions we considered are affected.

3.e) Race Conditions when Sending Signals (CVE-2025-46805)
----------------------------------------------------------

In socket.c lines 646 [20] and 882 [21] time-of-check/time-of-use
(TOCTOU) race conditions exist with regards to sending signals to user
supplied PIDs in setuid-root context.

The `CheckPid()` function [22] drops privileges to the real user ID and
tests whether the kernel allows to send a signal to the target PID using
these credentials. The actual signal is sent later via `Kill()`,
potentially using full root privileges. By this time, the PID that was
previously checked could have been replaced by a different, privileged
process. It might also be possible to trick the (privileged) Screen
daemon process into sending signals to itself, since a process is always
allowed to send signals to itself.

Currently this should only allow to send SIGCONT and SIGHUP signals,
thus the impact is likely only in the area of a local denial of service
or a minor integrity violation.

The issue affects both Screen version 5.0.0 and older version 4
releases, when Screen is installed setuid-root. This issue results from
an incomplete fix [23] for CVE-2023-24626: before this incomplete fix,
the signals in question could be sent to arbitrary processes even
without winning a race condition.

### Bugfix

Patch 0003 in the attached screen-4.9.1-patches.tar.gz and patch 0006 in
the attached screen-5.0.0-patches.tar.gz address the problem by sending
the actual signal with real UID privileges, just like `CheckPid()` does.

### Affected Distributions

All distributions we considered are affected.

3.f) Bad `strncpy()` Use Leads to Crashes when Sending Commands
---------------------------------------------------------------

We believe this is a non-security issue, but one that still should be
fixed with priority. The issue is only found in Screen version 5.0.0.

In commit 0dc67256 [24] a number of `strcpy()` calls have been replaced
by `strncpy()`. The author obviously was not aware of the unfortunate
semantics that `strncpy()` has. This function is not intended for safe
string handling, but to maintain zero padded buffers of fixed length.
For this reason, `strncpy()` does not stop writing data to the
destination buffer when the first `\0` byte is encountered, but it
writes out zeroes until the buffer is completely filled.

Apart from leading to bad performance, this also triggers a bug in
attacher.c line 465. The following change has been applied there:

    -      strcpy(p, *av);
    +      strncpy(p, *av, MAXPATHLEN);
           p += len;

These lines are part of the following for loop, which processes command
line parameters to send them to a running Screen session.

    for (; *av &amp;&amp; n &lt; MAXARGS - 1; ++av, ++n) {
            size_t len;
            len = strlen(*av) + 1;
            if (p + len &gt;= m.m.command.cmd + ARRAY_SIZE(m.m.command.cmd) - 1)
                    break;
            strncpy(p, *av, MAXPATHLEN);
            p += len;
    }

The call to `strncpy()` always passes `MAXPATHLEN` bytes as destination
buffer size. This is correct for the first iteration of the `for` loop,
when `p` points to the beginning of the `struct Message.command.cmd`
buffer declared in screen.h line 148 [25]. It is no longer correct for
following iterations of the `for` loop, however, when `p` is incremented
by `len`. This means future `strncpy()` calls will write an excess
amount of `\0` bytes beyond the end of the buffer.

The result of this can be observed on current Arch Linux when passing
more than one command argument to a running Screen instance:

    # create a new screen session
    user$ screen -S myinstance
    
    # and detach from it again
    (screen) user$ &lt;Ctrl A&gt; d
    
    # now try to send a command to the running session
    user$ screen -S myinstance -X blankerprg /home/$USER/blanker
    *** buffer overflow detected ***: terminated
    Aborted (core dumped)

The two command arguments lead to two iterations in the `for` loop described
above; the second iteration will trigger the buffer overflow detection. The
visible error only occurs when Screen is compiled with the `_FORTIFY_SOURCE`
feature enabled. Otherwise no errors are seen, not even when compiling with
`-fsanitize=address`, likely because after the end of the target buffer
another long buffer `char message[MAXPATHLEN * 2]` follows (thus only
application payload data is overwritten).

This issue allows the caller to overwrite `MAXPATHLEN` bytes of memory
following the `cmd` buffer with zeroes, which can cause integrity
violation in Screen, particularly when it runs setuid-root. Since an
equally sized buffer `writeback[MAXPATHLEN]` follows in memory, there
should be no possibilities to exploit this issue to the advantage of an
attacker, however.

To fix this, `MAXPATHLEN` needs to be replaced by the actually remaining
amount of bytes in `p`. Furthermore ideally all `strncpy()` calls should
be replaced by `snprintf(target, target_size, "%s", source)` to avoid
the unintended effect of zero padding the target buffer.

We wondered how this issue could be present in Screen 5.0.0 for such a
long time without anybody noticing. One part of the explanation likely
is that Screen version 5.0.0 is only present in few distributions so
far. Another aspect is that perhaps only few users are using this
feature to send commands to running Screen sessions. We still found a
report from not too long ago on the screen-users mailing list [26] that
seems to refer to exactly this issue.

### Bugfix

Patch 0003 in the attached screen-patches-5.0.0.tar.gz addresses this
problem by changing `strncpy()` to `snprintf()` and by properly passing
the amount of remaining space in the target buffer.

### Affected Distributions

All distributions shipping screen-5.0.0 are affected.

4) Possible Further Issues in Screen's setuid-root Implementation
=================================================================

While working on the bugfix for issue 3.e), we also noticed that the
original (incomplete) bugfix for CVE-2023-24626 introduced a regression
to the multi-user mode in Screen when the target session is running as
non-root. In this case the target session drops privileges to some UID X
and then attempts to send a signal to some UID Y (of the client), which
will always fail.

This shows that there are actually three different UIDs to be considered
in Screen's multi-user mode: effective UID 0 to perform privileged
operations, the real UID of the user creating the session and the real
UID of the user attaching to a session. We don't believe that the
current Screen code takes this properly into account.

This also brought to our attention that Screen multi-user sessions
created by `root` will "drop privileges" to the real UID of the creating
user, which will be UID 0, and thus effectively perform no privilege
drop at all.

5) General Recommendations
==========================

From the changes in Screen 5.0.0 we can see that there have been
attempts for a longer time to refactor the code base, which was still
written in K&amp;R style C before that. During this refactoring some of the
long established security logic has been broken, however, which led to
issues 3.a) and 3.c). Before doing further refactoring, some kind of
test suite could be helpful to verify various security properties of the
implementation. Also anybody who works on this code base obviously
should have knowledge about the many dangers that linger in setuid-root
binaries.

Even after fixing the issues we identified during our review, there are
still many areas left that make us worry as outlined in the previous
section. There is also a range of file system operations where security
is hanging by a thread.

There is furthermore a broad design issue in Screen: it runs with
elevated privileges all the time, and only selectively drops privileges
for operations that are considered dangerous. For a robust setuid-root
program this should be the other way around: privileges should be
dropped by default and only raised for operations that actually require
elevated privileges.

To make Screen acceptable for running setuid-root we suggest to
implement a design change in this regard and to carefully review each
privileged operation that remains for its security. We also suggest to
add logic to remove any environment variables except those that are
explicitly allowed in the setuid-root context. Other environment
variables like PATH should be sanitized to point only to trusted system
directories.

Given all this, we don't recommend to install Screen setuid-root at all
at the moment (neither version 5.0.0 nor the older 4.9 versions). An
alternative could be to offer the multi-user feature only in an opt-in
fashion, e.g. by allowing only members of a trusted group to run a
multi-user version of Screen.

6) Problematic Coordinated Disclosure Process and Upstream Status
=================================================================

When we reported these issues to upstream in February 2025, we offered
the usual coordinated disclosure process based on our policy [27].
Upstream expressed a lot of interest in keeping the issues private to
develop bugfixes before publication. A time frame of one to two months
was communicated to us for this purpose. We were not too happy with this
long embargo period, but we understand that many upstreams are lacking
resources, thus we agreed to these terms.

About a month later some activity ensued on upstream's end and discussions
about bugfixes started. These discussions were not too fruitful, but we
still believed that upstream would be able to deal with the issues - given it
was upstream itself that asked us to perform a security review for Screen.

No further communication happened, however, until about two weeks before
the maximum 90 days embargo period we offer, when we inquired upstream
about the current status and pointed out the publication date coming
close. We had to find out that upstream did not use the long time period
up to this point to work on the bugfixes. Meanwhile further
distributions like NetBSD updated to Screen 5.0.0, becoming fully
affected by issue 3.a), unaware of the risk.

It was only at this point that we realized that upstream was not
sufficiently familiar with the Screen code base, not capable of fully
understanding the security issues we reported and that they did not
clearly state that they need more help than us only reviewing patches
they come up with.

The communication with upstream became increasingly problematic:
upstream suddenly wanted to publish bugfixes earlier than we suggested,
even though many issues were still unaddressed. We tried to dissuade
upstream and quickly involved the distros mailing list [28] to make
other distributors aware of the issues. We exceptionally suggested a
publication date beyond our maximum 90 days embargo to the list, to
accommodate for the chaotic situation that the embargo ended up in.

After some further not very productive attempts to develop patches in
cooperation with upstream, we decided to take the matter into our own
hands. We developed the missing bugfixes and adjusted and properly
documented the patches that had already been drafted by upstream. In
doing this, we deduced that a dedicated upstream would likely have been
able to complete the coordinated disclosure process within about two
weeks.

We are not satisfied with how this coordinated disclosure developed, and
we will try to be more attentive to such problematic situations early on
in the future. This experience also sheds light on the overall situation
of Screen upstream. It looks like it suffers from a lack of manpower and
expertise, which is worrying for such a widespread open source utility.
We hope this publication can help to draw attention to this and to
improve this situation in the future.

8) Timeline
===========

2024-07-01: A review request from upstream was forwarded to us [2].
2025-01-08: We started working on the review.
2025-02-07: We privately reported the issues to the Screen upstream by email, offering coordinated disclosure.
2025-02-07: Upstream expressed that they will need 1 - 2 months of time to work on the issues, likely requiring most of the 90 days maximum embargo period we offered.
2025-02-11: We created private bugs [29] in the GNU Savannah bug tracker to deal with each finding.
2025-03-11: Some discussions started in the private GNU Savannah bugs about patches for a couple of the findings.
2025-04-29: After nearly a month without visible activity, and the 90 days maximum embargo time approaching, we asked upstream for the current status and procedures for publication of the report.
2025-04-30: Upstream started taking up work again, trying to come up with fixes until the end of the 90 day embargo period. We offered advice on the various patches in the private GNU Savannah bugs.
2025-04-30: Following some unclarity in the discussion with upstream regarding CVE assignment, we decided to assign CVEs for the security relevant issues.
2025-04-30: Upstream declared its intention to publish something on the weekend, while bugfixes were still missing. We urged them not to do this. In the light of this we quickly forwarded a draft of this report to the distros mailing list [28] to give other distributors the chance to react to these findings before they go public.
2025-05-05: Although we did not get a clear answer, upstream ended up not publishing one-sidedly. Given the chaotic situation we suggested a publication date of 2025-05-12 to the distros mailing list, which was a few days after the 90 days maximum embargo period we usually offer upstream.
2025-05-07: Further attempts to develop the missing bugfixes in cooperation with upstream seemed futile. We started to develop all necessary patches on our own, some of them based on patches that had already been discussed in the upstream Savannah bugs. We shared the finished and tested patches for screen 4.9.1 and screen 5.0.0 with the distros mailing list and upstream.
2025-05-08: Upstream complained about wrong `Author:` tags in some of the patches we distributed (we did not receive formally finished patches from upstream, only copy/paste snippets). Thus we adjusted the authorship information for these patches to accommodate for this complaint and shared the updated result with the distros mailing list again.
2025-05-12: Publication of the report happened as planned on our blog and on the oss-security mailing list.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Exclusive</span> European software vendor Nextcloud has accused Google of deliberately crippling its Android Files application, which it says has more than 800,000 users.</p>
<p>The problem lies with the "<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/storage#all-files-access">All files access</a>" permission, where broad access to files on a device is required. While most applications can make do with Google's more privacy-friendly storage access tools, such as Storage Access Framework (SAF) or the MediaStore API, others require more permissions – hence the "All files access" privilege.</p>
<p>Nextcloud's Android Files app is a file synchronization tool that, according to the company, has long had permission to read and write all file types. "Nextcloud has had this feature since its inception in 2016," it said, "and we never heard about any security concerns from Google about it."</p>

    

<p>That changed in 2024, when someone or something at Google's Play Store decided to revoke the permission, effectively crippling the application. Nextcloud was instructed to use "a more privacy-aware replacement."</p>

        


        

<p>According to Nextcloud, "SAF cannot be used, as it is for sharing/exposing our files to other apps ... MediaStore API cannot be used as it does not allow access to other files, but only media files."</p>
<p>Attempts to raise the issue with Google resulted in little more than copy-and-pasted sections of the developer guide. "Despite multiple appeals from our side and sharing additional background, Google is not considering reinstating upload for all files," Nextcloud said.</p>

        

<p>The issue seems to stem from the Play Store. While a fully functional version is available on F-Droid, the Play Store edition is subject to Google's imposed limitations. Regarding the All files access permission, Google's developer documentation <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/storage#all-files-access">states</a>: "If you target Android 11 and declare All files access, it can affect your ability to publish and update your app on Google Play."</p>
<p>Nextcloud is clearly aggrieved by the change, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/14334">as are its users</a>.</p>
<p>"This might look like a small technical detail but it is clearly part of a pattern of actions to fight the competition," it said. "What we are experiencing is a piece of the script from the big tech playbook."</p>

</ul>
<p>Nextcloud cites examples, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2008/01/21/microsoft_seeks_dismissal_wordperfect_lawsuit/">allegations</a> leveled at Microsoft over the once-popular WordPerfect word processor, which were eventually <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2014/04/28/victory_for_microsoft_as_supremes_decline_to_hear_novells_wordperfect_whine/">snuffed out</a> in 2014, or the antics of Apple and Meta that have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/23/meta_apple_dma_ruling/">attracted scrutiny</a> from regulators.</p>
<p>In 2021, Nextcloud and other companies <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/02/nextcloud_onedrive_interview/">filed a complaint</a> in the EU regarding alleged anti-competitive behavior from Microsoft. "We are now four years in, and nothing has happened," the company said. "What do you think happens to a company that releases no updates to their app in four years?"</p>

        

<p>Are there nefarious actors at play here, an automated process that auto-rejects apps with elevated access requirements, or is it just simple incompetence? "Either way," Nextcloud said, "it results in companies like ours just giving up, reducing functionality just to avoid getting kicked out of their app store."</p>
<p>"The issue is that small companies – like ours – have pretty much no recourse," it added. Nextcloud went on to criticize oversight processes as slow-moving, with fines that sound hefty but amount to little more than a slap on the wrist.</p>
<p>"Big Tech is scared that small players like Nextcloud will disrupt them, like they once disrupted other companies. So they try to shut the door."</p>
<p>Nextcloud told us the app's installed audience is 824,000 on Android - customers that used the app in the last 30 days.</p>
<p><i>The Register</i> repeatedly asked Google to comment, but it failed to respond. ®</p>

Plus some were hired away because of the good leaderboard scores.</p><p>Article of the winner (just google "Ilya Rice: How I Won the Enterprise RAG Challenge") is considered by some companies as one of the best resources on building document-based AI systems.

Cold outreach works, the not so secret is that the message should be appealing.

                  <p>I start by building products for myself that I know solve my problem, so at least I have a user of 1. Then I try to get to 10 users personally through my personal network. This helps me validate how easy acquisition and onboarding will be. Then to get from 10 to 100 I post more widely about the product on social media. My current product <a href="https://humancrm.io/" rel="nofollow">https://humancrm.io</a> is at 16 users. I am adding about a user a week currently. All the while I work on SEO and backlinks. Once I get to 100 users then I'll probably start more bulk marketing to get to 1000.</p>

                  <p>The basic (marketing) problem is find where your users hang out and go meet them there. Usually for these kinds of products your customers will congregate somewhere online, reaching them though can be very tough. Try and drill down super narrow (if you can’t find a large community together ). Don’t try to convert new people, find people who are searching for a solution.</p>

                  <p>Education marketing is the trench warfare of marketing. Unless you are a big conglomerate, this is a terrible strategy.  "Finding people who are searching for a solution" is maneuver warfare. It's the best strategy, and the only one that should be employed by SMEs. OP is looking for 100 people when in reality they should be looking for 5 people who already know they want the solution you are offering. If the product/service works, these five people will become sales reps for you. NB. The trick is not selling the product to these five people. It is finding these five people.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In my book <a href="https://odinbook.com/">Understanding the Odin Programming Language</a> I wrote that “Odin incorporates some of my favorite C best practices, straight into the language”. But I didn’t really elaborate on the details. Let’s do that here!</p><p>This brings me to talking a bit about a previous job I had. Back in 2021 I worked at a place called <a href="https://ruby0x1.github.io/machinery_blog_archive/">Our Machinery</a>. We were creating a whole game engine in plain C. We used a very comfortable and powerful way to program C.</p><p>We relied on concepts such as:</p><ul><li>Custom allocators</li><li>Temporary allocators</li><li>Tracking allocators</li><li>Designated initializers</li><li>Zero is initialized</li><li>Cache friendly programming</li></ul><p>While working there, I stumbled upon Odin. I read a bit about it. It seemed to incorporate all these things. In many ways it seemed like a language built around the specific way in which we programmed C at my job. Since I liked that way of programming, it almost seemed like a language built for me!</p><h2 id="custom-allocators">Custom allocators</h2><p>At my job we had implemented our own <code>Allocator</code> interface in C. An allocator provides a custom way in which one can do dynamic memory allocations. C programmers are used to <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>. But you can make allocators that provide more advanced allocation strategies. Our <code>Allocator</code> interface made it possible to reason about allocators in a uniform way and pass them around to functions.</p><p>If a function accepted a parameter of type <code>Allocator</code>, then it was a hint that its return value was dynamically allocated.</p><p>This is exactly how it works in Odin. But the <code>Allocator</code> interface <a href="https://pkg.odin-lang.org/base/runtime/#Allocator">is built into the language’s <code>base</code> library collection</a>! This meant that Odin’s <code>base</code> and <code>core</code> libraries support these allocators too. At my job, the <code>Allocator</code> interface was only supported in our own code: The C standard library didn’t support any of that. But in Odin, my own code <em>and</em> the <code>core</code> libraries can reason about custom allocators, making the concept even more powerful.</p><blockquote><p>In Odin, <code>core</code> and <code>base</code> are two collections of libraries that come with the compiler. Some refer to them as the “standard library” of Odin. But they are shipped as source with the compiler. You are encouraged to make copies of the packages inside <code>core</code>, making it possible to tailor those packages to your own needs. So it’s more of a “default library” than a “standard library”. There’s a sensible default, but you’re free do things however you want.</p></blockquote><h2 id="temporary-allocators">Temporary allocators</h2><p>Temporary memory allocators provide a way to do dynamic memory allocations that are only needed for a short while. What’s “a short while”? Video games have a very convenient “short while”: A single frame.</p><p>At my C job we had a temporary allocator that I used <em>a lot</em>. Gone was the need to manually <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> strings and arrays that were only needed for a short while. Just use the temp allocator. It’ll be gone the next frame! And it’s more efficient: The temp allocator allocates into pre-allocated blocks of memory.</p><p>I was happy to discover that Odin came with exactly this functionality. There’s a built in temp allocator available under the name <code>context.temp_allocator</code>. And again, the <code>core</code> libraries and my code uses the same <code>Allocator</code> interface. So I can just pass <code>context.temp_allocator</code> into any <code>core</code> library procedure that accepts an <code>Allocator</code> parameter. Whatever that procedure allocates will then be temporary. Nice!</p><blockquote><p>Odin lets you choose when to clear the temp allocator. You do that by putting <code>free_all(context.temp_allocator)</code> somewhere in your code. In a video game, I’d put it as the last line of the “main game loop”.</p></blockquote><h2 id="tracking-allocators">Tracking allocators</h2><p>Manual memory management may seem hard. How do you know if you’re leaking memory?</p><p>At my C job we had a special tracking allocator that could wrap any other allocator. It recorded when an allocation happened, and recorded when it was deallocated. That way we could display a warning on shutdown, if anything hadn’t been deallocated.</p><p>This is exactly how the tracking allocator that comes with Odin works. Just plop the code below at the top of your <code>main</code> procedure. It’ll print a list of memory leaks on shutdown.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span><span>track</span><span>:</span> <span>mem</span><span>.</span><span>Tracking_Allocator</span>

</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><blockquote><p>You’ll also need to do <code>import "core:mem"</code> and <code>import "core:fmt"</code> at the top of the file. The code above is from the <a href="https://odin-lang.org/docs/overview/#tracking-allocator">Odin overview</a>.</p></blockquote><h2 id="zero-is-initialized-zii">Zero is initialized (ZII)</h2><p>ZII, short for zero is initialized, means that you try to make the zero-value of memory valid in as many situations as possible.</p><p>In Odin all variables are automatically zero initialized. Not just integers and floats. But all structs as well. Their memory is filled with zeroes when those variables are created. So if <code>Some_Type</code> is a struct, then you can just write the following line to declare and zero-initialize a variable of that type:</p><p>This makes ZII extra powerful! There is little risk of variables accidentally being uninitialized. You can lean on that zero initialization. Also, the whole <code>core</code> library of Odin relies on ZII as well. So it feels very natural throughout the whole language and its ecosystem.</p><blockquote><p>You can skip zero initialization by writing <code>x: Some_Type = ---</code>. You rarely need to do so, but it can be a good idea in some specific, performance sensitive situations. It’s great that zero initialization is opt out, instead of opt in. That way we get way less bugs due to uninitialized memory.</p></blockquote><h2 id="designated-initializers">Designated initializers</h2><p>This is a feature built into both C and Odin. The code below will create a variable <code>x</code> of type <code>My_Type</code>. It’ll initialize the field <code>number</code> to <code>7</code>. Any non-mentioned field will be zero-initialized. This plays very well together with the “zero is initialized” concept.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span><span>My_Type</span> <span>::</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>

</span></span><span><span>	<span>number</span> <span>=</span> <span>7</span><span>,</span>	
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="cache-friendly-programming">Cache friendly programming</h2><p>The CPU has some memory inside it that is very fast. It’s called a cache. If you keep the cache filled with whatever data the CPU might need next, then your program will run very fast.</p><p>At my C job we had an entity-component-system (ECS) that used what is known as “Structure of Arrays” (SoA). That’s a memory layout that can, in certain circumstances, help fill your CPU cache with relevant data. Anyone who has written SoA data types in C knows it’s not very fun.</p><p>However, Odin comes with built in SoA support. Just put <code>#soa</code> in front of an array declaration. It’ll automatically re-arrange the memory layout for you.</p><p>As an example, the following code uses the “default layout”. Also known as “Arrays of Structures” (AoS):</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span><span>Person</span> <span>::</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>	<span>health</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>	<span>age</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>people</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>128</span><span>]</span><span>Person</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The memory layout of the <code>people</code> array looks like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>people[0].health
</span></span><span><span>people[0].age
</span></span><span><span>people[1].health
</span></span><span><span>people[1].age

</span></span><span><span>people[4].health
</span></span><span><span>people[4].age
</span></span><span><span>... etc
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you add <code>#soa</code> in front of <code>[128]Person</code>, like so:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span><span>Person</span> <span>::</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>	<span>health</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span>

</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>people</span><span>:</span> <span>#</span><span>soa</span><span>[</span><span>128</span><span>]</span><span>Person</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>then the memory layout of <code>people</code> will instead look like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>people[0].health
</span></span><span><span>people[1].health
</span></span><span><span>people[2].health
</span></span><span><span>people[3].health
</span></span><span><span>people[4].health
</span></span><span><span>... and 123 more health items
</span></span><span><span>people[0].age
</span></span><span><span>people[1].age
</span></span><span><span>people[2].age
</span></span><span><span>people[3].age
</span></span><span><span>people[4].age
</span></span><span><span>... and 123 more age items
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Achieving this in C is manual work. But here you just add <code>#soa</code>.</p><p>Now, don’t go putting <code>#soa</code> everywhere, just because you can. It will still make the code a bit trickier to write (you need to use <code>#soa</code> pointers etc instead of normal pointers). The code will also be a bit harder to debug. Put it in if you have proof of a clear performance benefit.</p><blockquote><p>By the way, I discourage anyone who is making their own video game from making an ECS. It’s usually not a good idea. Perhaps it’s a good idea for some massive game engines. But for a small project it might just make your code harder to write and thereby your game worse. I feel like people who write an ECS before starting on their gameplay code are people who actually don’t want to make games: They want to make general purpose game engines. That’s fine, but make sure you’re not lying to yourself about what it is you want to do. If you want to make a game, then just make a game. Write the code that you need for the problem at hand, don’t pretend to be a giant game engine company.</p></blockquote><h2 id="finally-simplicity">Finally: Simplicity</h2><p>Odin is very simple language. The reason my job used C over C++ was partially because of the simplicity of C. But we did sometimes miss some modern ideas of C++. However, C++ is a massive beast. We didn’t want to open that can of worms.</p><p>Odin retains the simplicity of C while bringing along some nice modern things, such as generics and (explicit) overloading. But the language is still kept small and simple. And it is meant to remain so. Very few language features have been added to Odin over the last few years. It’s mostly the <code>core</code> libraries that are getting major changes at this point.</p><h2 id="not-everyone-has-my-programming-background">Not everyone has my programming background</h2><p>Learning Odin came naturally to me, due to it being so similar to the way in which I wrote C code.</p><p>You may come from a different background. If these things are unfamiliar to you, but you still want to learn Odin, then perhaps you’d benefit from reading my book <a href="https://odinbook.com/">Understanding the Odin Programming Language</a>. It’s meant to be a reader-friendly intro to the language. The book tries to give you the insights I already had when I discovered Odin.</p><h2 id="thanks-for-reading">Thanks for reading!</h2><p>Why not drop by <a href="https://discord.gg/4FsHgtBmFK">my Discord server</a>? On there you can ask me questions as well as discuss Odin and game development.</p><p>Have a nice day!</p><p>/Karl Zylinski</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Modern large language models (LLMs) often encounter communication bottlenecks on current hardware, rather than purely computational constraints. Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) tackles this challenge by using low-rank matrices in the key-value (KV) layers, thereby allowing compressed latent KV states to be cached. This approach significantly reduces the KV cache size relative to traditional multi-head attention, leading to faster inference. Moreover, MLA employs an up-projection matrix to increase expressiveness, trading additional computation for reduced communication overhead. Although MLA has demonstrated efficiency and effectiveness in Deepseek V2/V3/R1, many major model providers still rely on Group Query Attention (GQA) and have not announced any plans to adopt MLA. In this paper, we show that GQA can always be represented by MLA while maintaining the same KV cache overhead, but the converse does not hold. To encourage broader use of MLA, we introduce TransMLA, a post-training method that converts widely used GQA-based pre-trained models (e.g., LLaMA, Qwen, Mixtral) into MLA-based models. After conversion, the model can undergo additional training to boost expressiveness without increasing the KV cache size. Furthermore, we plan to develop MLA-specific inference acceleration techniques to preserve low latency in transformed models, thus enabling more efficient distillation of Deepseek R1.

<p dir="auto"><strong>wtfis</strong> is a commandline tool that gathers information about a domain, FQDN or IP address using various OSINT services. Unlike other tools of its kind, it's built specifically for human consumption, providing results that are pretty (YMMV) and easy to read and understand.</p>
<p dir="auto">This tool assumes that you are using free tier / community level accounts, and so makes as few API calls as possible to minimize hitting quotas and rate limits.</p>
<p dir="auto">The project name is a play on "whois".</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><section><h2>A conversation about AI for science with Jason Pruet, Director of the Laboratory’s National Security AI Office.</h2><p>March 31, 2025</p></section><div><p><a href="https://cdn.lanl.gov/files/1663-45-qa-jason-pruet_2f929.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download a print-friendly version of this article.</a></p><p>Jason Pruet is working with teams across the Laboratory to help prepare for a future in which artificial intelligence will reshape the landscape of science and security. Five years ago, he viewed AI as just another valuable tool, but because of recent advances in the power of large AI models, Pruet now believes AI will be broadly disruptive. He no longer views the technology as just a tool, but as a fundamental shift in how scientists approach problems and make discoveries. The global race humanity is now in is about how to harness the technology’s potential while mitigating its harms.</p><p><strong>1663: </strong>&nbsp;This year, the Lab invested more in AI-related work than at any point in history. You’ve spoken about government investment in AI in terms of returning to a post–World War II paradigm of science for the public good. Can you expand on that?</p><p><strong>JP:</strong> &nbsp;Before World War II, the government wasn’t really involved in science the way we think of it today. But after WWII, Vannevar Bush, a key figure behind the Manhattan Project, laid the groundwork for permanent government support of science and engineering. I’m paraphrasing here, but he had this beautiful quote where he said, “Just as it’s been the policy of the government to keep the frontiers of exploration open for everyone, so it’s the policy of the government that the frontiers of knowledge are open for everyone.”</p><p>That uniquely American idea helped build the American Century. After the war, Los Alamos leadership realized that the future of security and science depended on the ability to study energetic particles and nuclear reactions. The problem was that no university could do it because they didn’t have the means to build these giant machines. And the Lab couldn’t do it without the support of the universities, so they made a deal where the Atomic Energy Commission would pay for these giant facilities, like the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Without that kind of infrastructure, the country had no credible way of being a scientific superpower anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>For a variety of reasons, government support for big science has been eroding since then. Now, AI is starting to feel like the next great foundation for scientific progress. Big companies are spending billions on large machines, but the buy-in costs of working at the frontiers of AI are so high that no university has the exascale-class machines needed to run the latest AI models. We’re at a place now where we, meaning the government, can revitalize that pact by investing in the infrastructure to study AI for the public good.</p><p><strong>1663: </strong>&nbsp;That’s a fascinating parallel. You mentioned the massive infrastructure required for cutting-edge AI research. Is that something universities can collaborate on with Los Alamos?</p><p><strong>JP:</strong> &nbsp;Exactly. Part of what we’re doing with the Lab’s machines, like Venado—which has 2500 GPUs—is giving universities access to that scale of computing. The scale is just completely different. A typical university might have 50 or 100 GPUs.<br>Right now, for example, we have partnerships with the University of California, the University of Michigan, and many other universities where researchers can tap into this infrastructure. That’s something we want to expand on. Having university collaboration will be critical if the Department of Energy is going to have a comprehensive AI program at scale that is focused on national security and energy dominance.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1663:</strong> &nbsp;What changed in the last few years to enable this rapid progress? Is it just bigger models, or is there something else at play?</p><p><strong>JP:</strong> &nbsp;One of the biggest shifts came from a 2017 paper called “Attention Is All You Need,” written by a small group of Google researchers. This paper introduced the transformer architecture, which allowed for a huge leap in how we could scale AI models. It turns out that the bigger the model, the better it performs. Transformers also allow for mixing different types of information—text, images, equations—all within a single framework.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1663:</strong> &nbsp;Has your perspective on AI shifted since the development of the transformer model?</p><p><strong>JP:</strong> &nbsp;Definitely. There was a time when I wouldn’t have advocated for government investment in AI at the scale we’re seeing now. But the weight of the evidence has become overwhelming. Large models— “frontier models”—have shown such extraordinary capabilities with recent advances in areas as diverse as hypothesis generation, mathematics, biological design, and complex multiphysics simulations. The potential for transformative impact is too significant to ignore.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1663:</strong> &nbsp;Can you describe where we are on the trajectory of AI development?</p><p><strong>JP:</strong> &nbsp;That’s a tricky question because we really don’t understand the full potential of this technology yet. The AI community uses different benchmarks to test the capabilities: one each for math, verbal reasoning, symbolic reasoning, theory of mind, the bar exam. Over the last two years, we’ve more or less run out of benchmarks where AI isn’t better than humans. An exception is for a particular class of abstract reasoning, though I’d be surprised if that benchmark doesn’t also fall in the next year.&nbsp;</p><p>The basic problem with this technology is that we don’t fully understand it. We have no predictive ability to say, “Oh, if I do 10 times more compute, then this will happen.” My colleague Juston Moore has emphasized that there would be a great strategic advantage for the nation that first develops an ability to scientifically understand AI models. Absent that, there’s a deep argument within the community about whether we’re near the top or the bottom. What is clear is that the speed of progress is faster than anyone could have predicted, and there’s no indication that it will slow anytime soon.</p><p><strong>1663:</strong> &nbsp;Is it fair to think of this moment as an international arms race over AI?</p><p><strong>JP:</strong> &nbsp;I want to start with a historical analogy. In the industrial revolution, the focus shifted from humans and animals doing manual labor to building machines for mechanical labor. In the AI revolution, we’re going from cognitive labor being done by humans to cognitive labor being done by machines. If you’ve played with the most recent AI tools, you know: They’re very good coders, very good legal analysts, very good first drafters of writing, very good image generators. They’re only going to get better. Viewed through the lens of machines becoming the basis for the next generation of cognitive labor, it’s obvious what the strategic significance of these tools is.</p><p>So yes, it’s becoming more likely that AI will be a means by which nations gain strategic and potentially decisive advantages. China’s leadership sees AI as a general-purpose technology, much like electricity or the internal combustion engine—something that can drive progress across many areas of life, from the economy to defense. After DeepMind’s AlphaGo defeated the Chinese grandmaster Ke Jie in May 2017, within three to six months, China’s government launched a national AI strategy. What China saw from that was that if your goal is strategic dominance through subtle means, then for the first time in human history, we have a technology that can do that.</p><p>Let me give you another example of how AI is already changing power structures. I have a friend, Chuck Mielke, who works here at the Lab and often reviews papers written by researchers from rural Chinese universities. For years, he’d get these papers, and they were so hard to get through, so hard to understand. Then, suddenly, new AI technologies came out, and the papers he received were beautifully written and argued. For decades, the U.S. has had a structural advantage because English is the dominant language in scientific literature. AI eroded that overnight.&nbsp;</p><p>All that said, I’m increasingly uncomfortable viewing this through the lens of a traditional arms race. Many thoughtful and respected people have emphasized that AI poses enormous risks for humanity. There are credible reports that China’s leadership has come to the same view, and that internally, they are trying to better balance the potential risks rather than recklessly seek advantage. It may be that the only path for managing these risks involves new kinds of international collaborations and agreements.</p><p><strong>1663: </strong>&nbsp;What’s the message you want scientists at the Lab to take away from all of this?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JP:</strong> &nbsp;My sense is that most of our researchers have a deep appreciation of the significance of these technologies. Whether it’s for scientific research, manufacturing, operations, or even legal and public affairs, AI is going to be the driving force behind how we do things moving forward. This isn’t just a tool; it’s a fundamental shift in how we approach problems and make discoveries. We’re at a point now where the potential of the technology has been demonstrated to such an extent that the question is really about the pace of adoption. The recent release by OpenAI of new models capable of pretty good step-by-step reasoning only reinforces this view.</p><p><strong>1663:</strong> &nbsp;How does that make you feel?</p><p><strong>JP:</strong> &nbsp;Like we’re behind. The ability to use machines for general-purpose reasoning represents a seminal advance with enormous consequences. This will accelerate progress in science and technology and expand the frontiers of knowledge. It could also pose disruptions to national security paradigms, educational systems, energy, and other foundational aspects of our society. As with other powerful general-purpose technologies, making this transition will depend on creating the right ecosystem. To do that, we will need new kinds of partnerships with industry and universities.</p><p><strong>1663:</strong> &nbsp;Do you think we’re heading toward a future where every country will develop its own AI capabilities?</p><p><strong>JP: </strong>&nbsp;For nations that can afford it, yes. Countries like the UK, China, and France have already been clear about their intentions to develop their own sovereign AI capabilities. The United Arab Emirates invested billions of dollars from its sovereign wealth funds because it recognized the significance of this technology. It’s like—you can’t have somebody else control your oil, you can’t have somebody else control your food, and now, you can’t have somebody else control your AI.</p><p>To get back to the Vannevar Bush thing we were discussing earlier: One could say, “Why don’t we just let private industry build these giant engines for progress and science, and we’ll all reap the benefits?” The problem is that if we’re not careful, it could lead us to a very different country than the one we’ve been in. We certainly need to partner with industry. Because they are so far ahead and are making such giant investments, that is the only possible path. But at the same time, we’ll need to figure out how to preserve Vannevar’s pact.</p><h3 id="ask">People also ask</h3><ul>  <li><strong>What are some of the risks of AI?</strong> The doomsday scenario is that AI becomes more powerful than humans, posing an existential risk to humanity, but far more likely, nearer term concerns include job replacement, privacy breaches, and threats to security. All of these risks and more factored into the decision for Los Alamos National Laboratory to invest heavily in understanding and shaping the technology to prevent harm and help realize its vast potential for improving the world.</li>  <li><strong>How can AI help in my job?</strong> From automating processes to drafting memos or optimizing supply chains—AI can help accelerate many aspects of a wide variety of modern jobs. As one expert at Los Alamos National Laboratory puts it, “AI isn’t just a tool; it’s a fundamental shift in how we approach problems.” The task ahead for many workers will be adopting it quickly, smartly, and securely. &nbsp;</li></ul></div><section><h4>Share</h4><ul><li><a title="Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lanl.gov%2Fmedia%2Fpublications%2F1663%2F0125-qa-jason-pruet"></a></li><li><a title="Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lanl.gov%2Fmedia%2Fpublications%2F1663%2F0125-qa-jason-pruet&amp;text="></a></li><li><a title="LinkedIn" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lanl.gov%2Fmedia%2Fpublications%2F1663%2F0125-qa-jason-pruet"></a></li><li><a title="Pinterest" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lanl.gov%2Fmedia%2Fpublications%2F1663%2F0125-qa-jason-pruet&amp;media=&amp;description="></a></li><li><a title="Email" href="mailto:?subject='Check%20out%20this%20great%20article'&amp;body=Check%20out%20this%20article%20I%20found%20on%20Los%20Alamos%20National%20Laboratory's%20website:%20https://www.lanl.gov/media/publications/1663/0125-qa-jason-pruet"></a></li></ul></section></section></div>]]></description>

And even if this is a “local-only, no-cloud” assistant, the principles still apply. </p><p>Here’s why:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Models drift</strong><span> — even locally. If you fine-tune, you need to track it.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Prompt engineering is messy</strong><span> — your logic might change weekly.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Debugging hallucinations?</strong><span> Good luck without logs or prompt versions.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Dataset validation?</strong><span> — how do we really know that dataset we’ve just created is good enough?</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Evaluation the fine-tuned model</strong></p></li></ul><p>Let’s not forget that the building part of this system is happening on the cloud. Building the dataset, fine-tuning the model, deploy the model the model to a model registry</p><p>The irony of building an “on-device Siri” is that… it starts online.</p><p><span>Not cloud-based inference — but online </span><em>development</em><span>.</span><br><span>This is the part where MLOps earns its name.</span></p><p>When you build a voice assistant that runs locally, you still need:</p><ul><li><p>A fine-tuning dataset with function-calling principles in mind</p></li><li><p>A testing suite for common interactions</p></li><li><p>An evaluation strategy for real-world usage</p></li></ul><p>This is the first place people cut corners. They scrape a few prompts, convert them into JSON, and call it a dataset. Then they fine-tune, and wonder why the model breaks on anything slightly off-pattern.</p><p><span>A better approach is to </span><strong>version the dataset</strong><span>, test multiple edge cases, and label failure modes clearly. Ask:</span></p><ul><li><p>How diverse are your command phrasings?</p></li><li><p>Do you include rare or ambiguous intents?</p></li><li><p>Do you cover common errors like repetitions, hesitations, or mic glitches?</p></li></ul><p><span>Fine-tuning is deceptively simple. It works. Until it doesn’t.</span><br><span>The model improves on your examples — but gets worse everywhere else.</span></p><p>This is where experiment tracking matters. Use simple MLOps principles like:</p><ul><li><p>Version every checkpoint</p></li><li><p><span>Test on </span><strong>unseen commands</strong><span>, not just your eval set</span></p></li><li><p>Compare against your zero-shot baseline</p></li></ul><p><span>And most importantly, validate the hybrid system — </span><strong>LLM + function caller + speech parser</strong><span> — not just the LLM alone.</span></p><p>You don’t ship a local agent before stress-testing it. Build a script that runs through:</p><ul><li><p>100+ common voice commands</p></li><li><p>Wrong mic inputs</p></li><li><p>Conflicting functions</p></li><li><p>Empty or partial user phrases</p></li><li><p>Multiple accents and speech patterns (if you use Whisper or STT)</p></li></ul><p><span>Catch regressions </span><strong>before</strong><span> you put the model on-device.</span></p><p>This is where people relax. Don’t.</p><p>Deploying a model offline doesn’t mean it’s safe from bugs. It means you lose visibility.</p><p>So the only way to survive this phase is to prepare for it:</p><ul><li><p><span>Run your system on </span><strong>multiple devices</strong><span>, with different specs and OS versions</span></p></li><li><p>Use test users (not just friends) and ask them to break it</p></li><li><p>Track logs locally and offer a way for testers to export logs manually (opt-in)</p></li></ul><p>Here’s the system in 3 major phases:</p><p><span>Before we can train a model to call functions like </span><code>lock_screen()</code><span> or </span><code>search_google("ML Vanguards")</code><span>, we need to teach it how those calls </span><em>look</em><span> in a natural conversation. This part handles:</span></p><ul><li><p>Building a dataset using prompts and LLMs</p></li><li><p>Using templates to simulate human-like voice requests, simulating different core functions of your system</p></li><li><p>Automatically verifying outputs with a test engine</p></li><li><p>Creating a clean dataset for function-calling fine-tuning</p></li></ul><p><span>This is the most overlooked part in most LLM tutorials: </span><strong>how do you teach a model to behave in your context?</strong><span> Not by downloading </span><strong>alpaca</strong><span> data. You have to create your own, structured, specific, and validated.</span></p><blockquote><p>We don’t want “chatbot vibes.” We want deterministic, parseable function calls from real intent.</p></blockquote><p><span>Once we have the dataset, we fine-tune a small base model (like LLaMA 3.1 8B) using LoRA adapters. The goal is not general reasoning, it’s </span><em>precision</em><span> on our task: map spoken intent to exact API calls.</span></p><p>We use:</p><ul><li><p>Unsloth for fast, GPU-efficient fine-tuning</p></li><li><p>Supervised instruction tuning (SFT) with a custom loss</p></li><li><p>Weights &amp; Biases to track experiments</p></li><li><p>Export to GGUF for 4-bit quantized inference</p></li></ul><p><span>This step allows us to deploy the model efficiently on consumer hardware, laptops, phones, even </span><strong>Raspberry PIs (will be a BONUS chapter about this)</strong><span>  , without needing a GPU at inference time.</span></p><p>The final piece ties it all together. We connect:</p><ul><li><p>Whisper for speech-to-text</p></li><li><p>Our fine-tuned LLM for function parsing</p></li><li><p><span>A small toolset of real functions: </span><code>lock_screen()</code><span>, </span><code>get_battery_status()</code><span>, etc.</span></p></li></ul><p>The result? A working agent that:</p><ul><li><p>Listens to your voice</p></li><li><p>Converts it into structured function calls</p></li><li><p>Executes them on your machine</p></li><li><p><span>Does all of this </span><em>without touching the cloud</em></p></li></ul><p><strong>This system can run in real time, without network access, with full control and observability.</strong></p><p>Building AI systems that run locally doesn’t mean leaving rigor. In fact, it demands more of it.</p><p>You don’t have the fallback of logging everything to some remote server. You can’t ship half-baked models and patch them later with “just a new prompt.” Once it’s on-device, it’s on you.</p><p>So we start with MLOps. Not dashboards. Not tooling. Just a thinking framework:</p><ul><li><p>How do we avoid silent failures?</p></li><li><p>How do we make changes traceable?</p></li><li><p>How do we catch issues before the user does?</p></li></ul><p>This first lesson was about that thinking process.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>It's time to update your Macs again! This time, I'm not burying the lede. <b>CVE-2025-31250</b>, which was patched in today's releases of macOS Sequoia 15.5 et al., allowed for…</p>
    <ol>
      <li>…any <b>Application A</b> to make macOS show a permission consent prompt…</li>
      <li>…appearing as if it were coming from any <b>Application B</b>…</li>
      <li>…with the results of the user's consent response being applied to any <b>Application C.</b></li>
    </ol>
    <p>These did not have to be different applications. In fact, in most normal uses, they would all likely be the same application. Even a case where Applications B and C were the same but different than Application A would be relatively safe (if somewhat useless from Application A's perspective). However, prior to this vulnerability being patched, a lack of validation allowed for Application B (the app the prompt <em>appears</em> to be from) to be different than Application C (the <em>actual</em> application the user's consent response is applied to).</p>
    <p>Spoofing these kinds of prompts is not exactly new. In fact, <a href="https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/macos-hardening/macos-security-and-privilege-escalation/macos-security-protections/macos-tcc/macos-tcc-bypasses/index.html#tcc-request-by-arbitrary-name">the HackTricks wiki has had a tutorial on how to perform a similar trick on their site for a while.</a> However, their method requires:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>the building of an entire fake app in a temporary directory,</li>
      <li>the overriding of a shortcut on the Dock, and</li>
      <li>the simple hoping that the user clicks on the (now) fake shortcut.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This vulnerability requires <strong><em>none of the above.</em></strong></p>
    <h2>TCC</h2>
    <p>As I explained in <a href="https://wts.dev/posts/tcc-sql-injection/#TCC">my first ever article on this site,</a> TCC is the core permissions system built into Apple's operating systems. It is used by sending messages to the <code>tccd</code> daemon (or rather, by using functions in the private <code>TCC</code> framework). The framework is a private API, so developers don't call the functions directly (instead, public API's call the functions under-the-hood as needed). However, all this wrapping cannot hide the fact that the control mechanism is still simply sending messages to the daemon.</p>
    <p>The daemon uses Apple's public (but proprietary) <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xpc">XPC API</a> for messaging (specifically the lower-level dictionary-based API). Prior to this vulnerability being patched, any app with the ability to send XPC messages to <code>tccd</code> could send it a specifically-crafted message that, as described above, would make it display a permission prompt as if it were from one app but then apply the user's response to a completely separate app. But how was this possible, and was it even hard? Before I answer these questions, we need to detour into what will, at first, seem like a completely unrelated topic.</p>
    <h2>Apple Events</h2>
    <h3>What are Apple Events?</h3>
    <p><b>Apple Events</b> are a method of inter-process communication on macOS. As of writing, if you <a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=site:developer.apple.com+%22apple+events%22&amp;udm=14">search <code>site:developer.apple.com "apple events"</code> on Google,</a> one of the very first results will likely be <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/mac/pdf/Interapplication_Communication/Intro_to_Apple_Events.pdf">this PDF document titled <cite>Introduction to Apple Events</cite>.</a> Skimming through this PDF, you could be forgiven for thinking the contents are at all relevant to modern-day programming. You might find it strange that it starts at Chapter 3, but you may then <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl:https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/mac/pdf/Interapplication_Communication&amp;udm=14">search and find the other PDFs that comprise the book.</a></p>
    <p>Looking closer at the book, you might start to get confused at some of the code snippets. It's not until looking closer that you realize… <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/mac/pdf/Interapplication_Communication/Scripting_Components.pdf">some of this code is Pascal.</a> You may then hurriedly search the name of the book and find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inside-Macintosh-Interapplication-Communication-Technical/dp/0201622009">an Amazon listing</a> that includes the publication date: <time datetime="1993-01-01">January 1, 1993</time>. This is an old book. It predates Mac OS X, and is actually from the era prior (now retroactively known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS">Classic Mac OS</a>). So wait, if this protocol is that old, why am I talking about it now, in 2025, in the context of modern macOS?</p>
    <p>The situation I described above happened to me as I was searching for resources on Apple Events. I was looking into the protocol because really… Apple Events are <em>still</em> part of macOS. While the new kernel introduced with Mac OS X required the technology to be re-architected, the concept and general use still exists to this day.</p>
    <p>The most common use-case for Apple events today is automation (telling a app to perform a specific action or set of actions). This can be scripted through the use of Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/MacAutomationScriptingGuide/HowMacScriptingWorks.html">Open Scripting Architecture.</a> The primary language used for these scripts is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptLangGuide/introduction/ASLR_intro.html">AppleScript,</a> but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_OSA">JavaScript can also be used.</a> This is similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Script_Host">Windows Script Host</a> on Windows. And, like on Windows, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlnuk8W2A0Y">this scripting has been used as a vector for malware.</a></p>
    <h3>Apple Events and TCC</h3>
    <p>So what does this have to do with TCC? Well, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/701/?time=2195">as of macOS Mojave 10.14, the sending of Apple Events by an app requires specific user consent via TCC.</a> However, attempting to add Apple Events to TCC likely posed a challenge to Apple. Note that much of the following is speculation and I don't want to have to dig up old versions of TCC to validate my theories. However, I do believe they are likely fairly accurate.</p>
    <p>As I explained in my previous article, TCC stores user consent results in an SQLite database file located at <code>[User Home  Folder]/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db</code>. While it might seem strange to have such sensitive data stored out in the open, this file (and the directory containing it) are generally well-protected. However, this setup <em>has</em> been exploited multiple times in the past. You might already see the potential flaw. Let's put a pin in that and we'll come back to it later on in the article.</p>
    <p>Back to the database: among other columns, each row of <code>TCC.db</code> has</p>
    <ol>
      <li>a column for the app requesting a permission (or rather <q>service</q>, as TCC would call it),</li>
      <li>a column for the service the app requested, and</li>
      <li>a column for the user's consent response.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This model works great when there is a single resource behind a service. However, with Apple Events, the resource could be any receiving app. Apple's engineers <em>could</em> have simply added an <q>Apple Events</q> service which, when permission is granted to an application, would allow it to send Apple Events to <em>any</em> app. However, this would still leave the door open for abuse. Instead Apple decided to limit user consent for the sending of Apple Events on a per-receiving-app basis. But how could they do this?</p>
    <p>Rows in <code>TCC.db</code> that denote user consent responses for Apple Events use a <em>fourth</em> column: the <q>indirect object</q> column. An identifier for the receiving app is placed in this column. While I have only ever seen it used with Apple Events, <a href="https://www.rainforestqa.com/blog/macos-tcc-db-deep-dive">there is apparently one other service, <code>FileProviderDomain</code>, that uses it.</a> It's unclear to me if this column existed prior to the Mojave update, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was added <em>for</em> Apple Events, and the uses for other services came later. I could be wrong, but, again, I don't want to dig up old TCC releases to check. I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.</p>
    <p>Anyway, as many consent interactions with TCC do not require the use of this column, the TCC daemon handles messages that do and don't require it (among the many other functions of the daemon) separately. This is done through the string value of the <code>function</code> key in the XPC dictionary messages sent to the daemon. Specifically, the <code>TCCAccessRequestIndirect</code> function of the daemon handles messages that need to use the <q>indirect object</q> column in the resulting row that would be appended to the database.</p>
    <p>The <code>TCCAccessRequestIndirect</code> function included a logic bug that resulted in the behavior I described at the start of this article: where a sender could specify one app which would be used to build and display the user consent prompt while also specifying another that would actually be inserted into the database as the one that requested the service. This bug did not exist in other access-request functions.</p>

      }
  }</uint8></code></pre>
    <p>The above code may seem complicated, but really, not all of it is necessary or relevant. The logic bug itself was quite simple. Put simply, when sending an XPC dictionary message to <code>tccd</code> for the <code>TCCAccessRequestIndirect</code> function (and with a <code>target_prompt</code> of <code>2</code>)…</p>
    <ol>
      <li>…the name of the bundle at the path passed via the <code>target_path</code> key would be used for the GUI consent prompt…</li>
      <li>…while the bundle represented by the bundle ID passed via the <code>target_identifier</code> key would be the actual one inserted into the database.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Additionally, despite this specifically being a function <em>for</em> access requests with indirect objects, you could just specify an empty string as the indirect object and use the function for several other TCC services that didn't use that column. As for why the TCC daemon has two different fields that can be specified separately when they (logically) should always refer to the same thing: I have no idea. And while this vulnerability would still require the user to respond in the affirmative, it ultimately opened up a way to spoof TCC prompts as if they were coming from any other app on the user's machine. That was obviously not ideal.</p>
    <h2>Exploiting this Vulnerability</h2>
    <h3>Limitations and Quirks</h3>
    <p>Another limitation of this vulnerability was that it could only be used with a specific set of TCC services. However, this included many of the major ones such as Microphone, Camera, and the like. Consent prompts for access to specific directories could also be spoofed, but additional layers of security around files made it not very useful (although, unrelated, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/05/01/analyzing-cve-2025-31191-a-macos-security-scoped-bookmarks-based-sandbox-escape/">Apple did recently patch a filesystem-based sandbox escape</a>).</p>
    <p>An interesting factor of this vulnerability is that a malicious app could use it and have the user's consent result ultimately apply to <em>another</em> app. While this might not seem useful at first, it might be helpful for sophisticated attacks wherein an attacker has found a way to control another app, but still needs that app to have user consent to a TCC service in order to actually utilize it to its full potential.</p>
    <h3>Timing The Exploit</h3>
    <p>Timing <em>when</em> to show a spoofed prompt is key when exploiting this vulnerability. If a TCC consent prompt were to <em>randomly</em> appear to a user, they would likely view it with suspicion and click <q>Don't Allow</q>. However, if one were to appear at the correct time, the user might end up clicking <q>Allow</q>.</p>
    <p>But when exactly is <q>the correct time</q>? I'll answer that question with a question: did you know that, on macOS, an app can often easily <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsworkspace/runningapplications">view the list of running applications</a> and can even <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsworkspace/frontmostapplication">see which one is currently on top?</a> All a malicious app would have to do is lie in wait for a specific app to launch and/or become the <q>frontmost</q> app, and only <em>then</em> show a spoofed prompt with the name of that app. As it would appear when the user opens or switches to the app, they might be tricked into thinking the prompt came from that app.</p>
    <p>For example, an attacker could wait for the user to open FaceTime before showing a spoofed consent prompt for Camera permissions (hoping that the user doesn't see the FaceTime window already using their camera underneath the prompt). A potentially more fruitful path would be to wait until the user opens Voice Memos and then spoof a prompt for Microphone access. There are several other hypothetical scenarios, but those are two that come to mind. There is one more, though, that could chain into a complete TCC bypass.</p>
    <h3>Revisiting An Old Exploit</h3>
    <p>The astute among you might have wondered earlier: <q>if the location of the <code>TCC.db</code> database is dependent on the user's home folder, how is that determined?</q>. The answer to your question depends on <em>when</em> you're asking. Prior to updates released in mid-July of 2020, <a href="https://medium.com/@mattshockl/cve-2020-9934-bypassing-the-os-x-transparency-consent-and-control-tcc-framework-for-4e14806f1de8">the <code>tccd</code> daemon simply used the <code>HOME</code> environment variable</a> This vulnerability (<a href="http://x.com/mattshockl/status/1480612268857507841">retroactively named $HOMERun by the researcher</a>), opened up a trivial TCC bypass that was as simple as planting a fake <code>TCC.db</code> in the correct path off of a fake home folder and then setting the value of the <code>HOME</code> environment variable to that fake home folder.</p>
    <p>After the above was patched, the TCC daemon now queries the operating system's user info directory for the user's home folder. This is the proper way it should be done, as it is much more resistant to exploits. But it is not completely resistant. <a href="https://wojciechregula.blog/post/change-home-directory-and-bypass-tcc-aka-cve-2020-27937/">Wojciech Reguła, who I mentioned in one of my previous write-ups, found a way to abuse the plugin system of the GUI user info directory editor built into macOS,</a> while <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/01/10/new-macos-vulnerability-powerdir-could-lead-to-unauthorized-user-data-access/">the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team found a bypass they called <q>powerdir</q> using built-in import and export commands.</a></p>
    <p>There are two things an app generally needs to change the user's home folder. The first is root access. Neither of the above were able to bypass this requirement, and neither was this vulnerability able to do so. However, both of the above were able to bypass the second requirement: user consent to a specific TCC service. While this vulnerability cannot <em>completely</em> bypass this requirement, it <em>can</em> be used to present the user with a spoofed consent prompt for that specific TCC service, hoping that they click <q>Allow</q>.</p>
    <img alt="A dialog box that reads 'System Settings would like to administer your computer. Administration can include modifying passwords, networking, and system settings.'" src="https://wts.dev/posts/tcc-who/consent-prompt.png" height="700">
    <p>Consider the above prompt. Would you click <q>Allow</q>? If you've read this far in the article your answer is probably <q>no</q>. But think about if you hadn't read this article. If this prompt appeared <em>when you opened the System Settings app</em>, would you click <q>Allow</q> then? Maybe something else would tip you off. Maybe you would wonder <q>shouldn't the System Settings app already have permission to do this?</q> Perhaps, if you were skeptical enough, you would still click <q>Don't Allow</q>. But I don't think that's what <em>everyone</em> would do.</p>
    <p>In this hypothetical example, if you were unfortunate enough to be tricked by the above prompt and click <q>Allow</q> you would be giving some unknown app half of what it needs to ultimately change your home folder, plant a fake <code>TCC.db</code>, and bypass the real database. Those who read <a href="https://wts.dev/posts/tcc-sql-injection/">my first article</a> might wonder about <code>REG.db</code>, the database that keeps track of all valid <code>TCC.db</code> databases. Well, unfortunately, TCC provides a function for any app to simply add an entry to <code>REG.db</code>. Thus, even if it would have stood in the way of this exploit, it can be effectively thwarted by simply adding an entry with the path to the planted <code>TCC.db</code>.</p>
    <p>After receiving the tricked consent above, all the malicious app would need to do is find a way to escalate to root and use that (and the above) to modify the user info directory and change the user's home folder.</p>
    <p>To be transparent, I did not automate this process. I leave that as an exercise for the reader, if they so desire. However, I did manually play around with changing my home folder (and adding entries to <code>REG.db</code>) and did observe TCC using both my real database and one I planted (behaving differently with each as their contents diverged). This makes sense, as operating from any home folder is a legitimate use case for TCC.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, changing the user's home folder and planting a fake <code>TCC.db</code> (while also potentially adding an entry for it in <code>REG.db</code>) will likely be a viable exploit path now and into the future. Attackers and security researchers will just have to find new ways of breaking their way into modifying the user info directory.</p>
    <h2>Timeline</h2>
    <p>Something interesting to note is this: despite this not being my second ever article, this <em>was</em> the second ever bug I reported to Apple. It's taken a <em>long</em> time for Apple to ultimately patch this. By far, of the bugs I have reported (and that Apple has patched) this one has taken the longest amount of time to be patched:</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <h3>Miscellaneous Additions</h3>
    <p>For those wondering, yes TCC is the system behind the <q>Privacy &amp; Security</q> pane (renamed from <q>Security &amp; Privacy</q>) in the System Settings app. More specifically, the Apple-Events-related consent results appear under the <q>Automation</q> section. The <q>Privacy &amp; Security</q> pane, as a whole, provides a GUI allowing for users to review the consent they have given and (often) allowing them to revoke specific consent responses.</p>
    <p>Something ironic that I found is that if an attacker was able to successfully trick a user into allowing it to send Apple Events, the consent result would not appear in System Settings. This would make it so the user would be unable to revoke their consent through the GUI. There is a (fairly undocumented) <abbr title="command line interface">CLI</abbr> tool called <code>tccutil</code> they could use to revoke their consent, but I doubt most users know about it. I've only found it documented by Apple in two places: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1906/_index.html">an old Technical Q&amp;A</a> and <a href="https://it-training.apple.com/tutorials/support/sup125/">an IT training page.</a></p>
    <p>On another note, <a href="https://objective-see.org/blog/blog_0x7F.html">Apple's Endpoint Security framework recently added support for monitoring modifications to the TCC database.</a> If it works as expected, an app using the framework could provide users with the ability to recognize spoofed prompts by, at the very least, notifying them immediately after the fact which app they <em>actually</em> just gave their consent to. That is, if it's being used in the small window between when Apple implemented these events in their Endpoint Security framework and when they patched this vulnerability.</p>
    <h3>Apple's Fix</h3>
    <p>So, what was Apple's fix? To be honest, I'm not entirely sure. When writing this section originally, I downloaded the macOS Sequoia 15.5 RC update file, extracted the <code>tccd</code> binary from it, and performed some brief static analysis to determine what had changed. I came away with a theory of what it was doing at runtime, but I waited for the final release to confirm. It turns out that my original theory was wrong, and the patch Apple had made was quite a bit more complex. Looking closer, it appears they have addressed several issues with the original vulnerability. Not only can an app no longer spoof a TCC prompt in this way, the ability to simply specify an empty string for the indirect object appears similarly hampered.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, it appears these types of messages are now silently dropped by <code>tccd</code> and no action is taken. I'll probably end up looking through the patch more in order to fully understand it (and I wouldn't be surprised if others do as well), but from some brief probing I have done post-update it does seem to be a good patch. If it's not, I'm sure you'll see another update from me or whoever else finds their way around it at some point in the future. If there is something Apple missed, hopefully it doesn't take them another year to patch it!</p>
    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>If there's anything I've learned through security research, it's that if I want this vulnerability to pop I should give it a fancy name. I'm not really creative person, so I'll just pick the first thing that comes to my head.</p>
    <p>I'll call this vulnerability: <q>TCC, Who?</q>.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We introduce the Byte Latent Transformer (BLT), a new byte-level LLM architecture that, for the first time, matches tokenization-based LLM performance at scale with significant improvements in inference efficiency and robustness. BLT encodes bytes into dynamically sized patches, which serve as the primary units of computation. Patches are segmented based on the entropy of the next byte, allocating more compute and model capacity where increased data complexity demands it. We present the first FLOP controlled scaling study of byte-level models up to 8B parameters and 4T training bytes. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of scaling models trained on raw bytes without a fixed vocabulary. Both training and inference efficiency improve due to dynamically selecting long patches when data is predictable, along with qualitative improvements on reasoning and long tail generalization. Overall, for fixed inference costs, BLT shows significantly better scaling than tokenization-based models, by simultaneously growing both patch and model size.

    <p><strong>Startups Need to Take Security Seriously</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Timeline &amp; Responsible Disclosure</strong>: Upon identifying these vulnerabilities, I reached out to the Cerca team via email on <strong>February 23, 2025</strong>. The next day (<strong>Feb 24</strong>), we held a productive video call to discuss the vulnerabilities, potential mitigations, and next steps. During our conversation, the Cerca team acknowledged the seriousness of these issues, expressed gratitude for the responsible disclosure, and assured me they would promptly address the vulnerabilities and inform affected users.</em></p>

<p><em>Since then, I have reached out multiple times (on <strong>March 5</strong> and <strong>March 13</strong>) seeking updates on remediation and user notification plans. Unfortunately, as of today’s publication date (<strong>April&nbsp;21,&nbsp;2025</strong>), I have been met with radio silence. To my knowledge, Cerca has not publicly acknowledged this incident or informed users about this vulnerability, despite their earlier assurances to me. They also never followed up with me following our call and ignored all my follow up emails.</em></p>

<p><em>However, I was able to independently confirm that the vulnerabilities detailed in this blog post have since been patched,  enabling me to responsibly publish these findings.</em></p>

<p>Too few people know how to make secure apps – and the rush to market puts consumers at risk. Some of my friends were saying that they’d gotten texts from this new dating app called Cerca. Obviously, dating apps require a lot of personal information, so I wanted to make sure that my friends’ data was safe before they started using this app.</p>

<p><img src="https://alexschapiro.com/blog/assets/images/cerca-security/introtext.jpg" alt="Text telling users to download Cerca"></p>

<p>I downloaded the app and booted up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Proxy">Charles Proxy</a> (using the iPhone app) to intercept the network requests and see what this app was doing under the hood.</p>

<p>First things first, let’s log in. They only use OTP-based sign in (just text a code to your phone number), so I went to check the response from triggering the one-time password. <strong>BOOM</strong> – the OTP is directly in the response, meaning anyone’s account can be accessed with just their phone number.</p>

<p><img src="https://alexschapiro.com/blog/assets/images/cerca-security/otpresponse.png" alt="Screenshot of OTP response revealing the one-time password vulnerability"></p>

<p>However, I now needed to figure out a way to determine who has an account—I don’t just want to guess phone numbers. So I went to the <code>api.cercadating.com</code> endpoint and used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing">directory fuzzer</a> to enumerate paths, hoping to find relevant endpoints. I couldn’t access any part of the site without the relevant app header:</p>

<p><img src="https://alexschapiro.com/blog/assets/images/cerca-security/app-version.png" alt="App version information required by the API"></p>

<p>So I passed that header through using <a href="https://github.com/OJ/gobuster">Gobuster</a> and to my (semi) surprise all endpoints were exposed, thanks to finding the <code>/docs</code> endpoint which served <code>openapi.json</code>!</p>

<p><img src="https://alexschapiro.com/blog/assets/images/cerca-security/gobusterdocs.png" alt="Screenshot of the found /docs endpoint fro Gobuster"></p>

<p>I powered up Burp Suite and used the match-and-replace tools to always pass that app-version header, along with the bearer token I extracted from Charles proxy. Here is where it gets even more interesting.</p>

<p><img src="https://alexschapiro.com/blog/assets/images/cerca-security/allendpoints.png" alt="Screenshot showing all API endpoints exposed"></p>

<p>Some unprotected endpoints seemed to affect only business logic—such as this one I could use to force two people to match with each other:</p>

<p><img src="https://alexschapiro.com/blog/assets/images/cerca-security/matchendpoint.png" alt="Screenshot of the match endpoint used to force user matches"></p>

<p>But others, like the get user profile endpoint (<code>user/{user_id}</code>), seemed more interesting. This endpoint takes a valid user ID and returns all sorts of personal information (including the phone numbers necessary for total account takeover, thanks to the OTP vulnerability). I wrote a quick Python script to figure out valid user IDs, and then <strong>BANG</strong> – I’m in. I could enumerate over all users; the response format looked something like this:</p>

<p>Now not only could I figure out all valid phone numbers linked to an account (which can then be taken over using the OTP misconfiguration), but all of this PII is out there without OTP sign in needed! But it gets worse – the <code>national_id_verified</code> field seems especially concerning. Sure enough, they store your passport or ID information in the system too, like this:</p>

<p>This is only available to the signed-in user, but since I could sign in as any user, I could see anyone’s ID information if they had submitted it (again, I did not do this). Not only could I see <strong>anyone’s personal messages with potential dates</strong>, I may be able to see their <strong>passport information</strong>! I ran a quick script to see how many users I could get information about, how many were registered as Yale students (I assume more were Yale students and maybe just didn’t fill in their university), and how many users had input their ID information. The script basically just counted how many valid users it saw; if after 1,000 consecutive IDs it found none, then it stopped. So there could be more out there (Cerca themselves claimed 10k users in the first week), but I was able to find 6,117 users, 207 who had put their ID information in, and 19 who claimed to be Yale students.</p>

<p>This is an insane leak!! I have access to <strong>sexual preferences, intimate messages, and all sorts of PII from (according to Cerca themselves) tens of thousands of unsuspecting users</strong>. Cerca, in their privacy policy, says that “We use encryption and other industry-standard measures to protect your data,” but that is clearly misleading. This poses significant risks to user safety and privacy. Considering that I’m just a college student looking at this casually, it’s entirely possible other critical vulnerabilities may exist (though complete account takeover sets a pretty high bar).</p>

<p>The fallout from this vulnerability is a complete invasion of privacy with potentially very harmful real-world consequences. People need to learn how to make secure apps, and not claim their apps are safe when they aren’t. Especially for a dating app! You can’t expect all users to do the checking that I did in this article. Who knows how many people already had access to all this data before I found it? Someone out there could’ve already downloaded a full database of 6,000+ users’ personal info and intimate chats, ready to exploit it. If someone with malicious intent got their hands on this info it could lead to identity theft, stalking, blackmail – you name it. These types of vulnerabilities are really scary, <strong>they can ruin lives overnight</strong>. People need to prioritize securing user data, not just shipping an app they think can go viral. And I did not set out to find this vulnerability to write this blog post, but since Cerca has not responded to any of my mails since our call nor alerted any of their users, I thought that this was a fair post to publish. Not looking to pwn anyone, just want a safer internet!</p>

"They'd search someone, handcuff them, then shoot them", before cutting off the plastic handcuffs used to restrain people and "planting a pistol" by the body, he said.</p><p>The new testimony includes allegations of war crimes stretching over more than a decade, far longer than the three years currently being examined by a judge-led public inquiry in the UK.</p><p>The SBS, the Royal Navy's elite special forces regiment, is also implicated for the first time in the most serious allegations - executions of unarmed and wounded people.</p><p>A veteran who served with the SBS said some troops had a "mob mentality", describing their behaviour on operations as "barbaric".</p><p>"I saw the quietest guys switch, show serious psychopathic traits," he said.  "They were lawless. They felt untouchable."</p><p>Special Forces were deployed to Afghanistan to protect British troops from Taliban fighters and bombmakers. The conflict was a deadly one for members of the UK's armed forces – 457 lost their lives and thousands more were wounded.</p><p>Asked by the BBC about the new eyewitness testimony, the Ministry of Defence said that it was "fully committed" to supporting the ongoing public inquiry into the alleged war crimes and that it urged all veterans with relevant information to come forward. It said that it was "not appropriate for the MoD to comment on allegations" which may be in the inquiry's scope.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2>'Psychotic murderers' in the regiment</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>The eyewitness testimony offers the most detailed public account of the killings to date from former members of UK Special Forces (UKSF), the umbrella group which contains the SAS, SBS and several supporting regiments.</p><p>The testimony, from more than 30 people who served with or alongside UK Special Forces, builds on years of reporting by BBC Panorama into allegations of extrajudicial killings by the SAS.</p><p>Panorama can also reveal for the first time that then Prime Minister David Cameron was repeatedly warned during his tenure that UK Special Forces were killing civilians in Afghanistan.</p><p>Speaking on condition of anonymity because of a de facto code of silence around special forces operations, the eyewitnesses told the BBC that the laws of war were being regularly and intentionally broken by the country's most elite regiments during operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan.</p><p>Those laws state that on such operations people can be deliberately killed only when they pose a direct threat to the lives of British troops or others. But members of the SAS and SBS were making their own rules, the eyewitnesses said.</p><p>"If a target had popped up on the list two or three times before, then we'd go in with the intention of killing them, there was no attempt to capture them," said one veteran who served with the SAS, referring to people who had been previously captured, questioned and then released.</p><p>"Sometimes we'd check we'd identified the target, confirm their ID, then shoot them," he said. "Often the squadron would just go and kill all the men they found there."</p><p>One witness who served with the SAS said that killing could become "an addictive thing to do" and that some members of the elite regiment were "intoxicated by that feeling" in Afghanistan. There were "lots of psychotic murderers", he said.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250428-123652-7bc49a8f4-web-2.20.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3056/live/a6b669b0-2cc4-11f0-a654-3fbec6ba11e7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3056/live/a6b669b0-2cc4-11f0-a654-3fbec6ba11e7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3056/live/a6b669b0-2cc4-11f0-a654-3fbec6ba11e7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3056/live/a6b669b0-2cc4-11f0-a654-3fbec6ba11e7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3056/live/a6b669b0-2cc4-11f0-a654-3fbec6ba11e7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3056/live/a6b669b0-2cc4-11f0-a654-3fbec6ba11e7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3056/live/a6b669b0-2cc4-11f0-a654-3fbec6ba11e7.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3056/live/a6b669b0-2cc4-11f0-a654-3fbec6ba11e7.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A meeting at Downing Street in 2011 between UK Prime Minister David Cameron, wearing a dark suit and tie, and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who is wearing a dark suit and shirt and an embroidered chapan, an Afghan coat or cape, with purple and green stripes.

"They'd go in and shoot everyone sleeping there, on entry. It's not justified, killing people in their sleep."</p><p>A veteran who served with the SBS told the BBC that after bringing an area under control, assault teams would sweep through the area shooting anyone on the ground, checking the bodies and killing anyone left alive. "It was expected, not hidden. Everyone knew," he said.</p><p>Intentionally killing wounded people who do not pose a threat would be a clear breach of international law. But the SBS veteran told Panorama that wounded people were routinely killed. He described one operation during which a medic was treating someone who had been shot but was still breathing. "Then one of our blokes came up to him. There was a bang. He'd been shot in the head at point-blank range," he said.</p><p>The killings were "completely unnecessary," he added. "These are not mercy killings. It's murder."</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>More junior members of assault teams were told by more senior SAS operators to kill male detainees, according to the testimony, using instructions such as "he's not coming back to base with us" or "this detainee, you make sure he doesn't come off target".</p><p>Detainees were people who had surrendered, been searched by special forces, and were typically handcuffed. British and international law forbid troops from deliberately killing unarmed civilians or prisoners of war.</p><p>A former SAS operator also described learning of an operation in Iraq during which someone was executed.</p><p>"It was pretty clear from what I could glean that he posed no threat, he wasn't armed. It's disgraceful. There's no professionalism in that," the former operator said. The killing was never properly investigated, he added. According to the SAS veteran, the problem started long before the regiment moved across to Afghanistan and "senior commanders were aware of that".</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250428-123652-7bc49a8f4-web-2.20.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8cd6/live/be96f6f0-2cdb-11f0-992a-53cdd61a1eb7.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8cd6/live/be96f6f0-2cdb-11f0-992a-53cdd61a1eb7.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8cd6/live/be96f6f0-2cdb-11f0-992a-53cdd61a1eb7.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8cd6/live/be96f6f0-2cdb-11f0-992a-53cdd61a1eb7.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8cd6/live/be96f6f0-2cdb-11f0-992a-53cdd61a1eb7.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8cd6/live/be96f6f0-2cdb-11f0-992a-53cdd61a1eb7.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8cd6/live/be96f6f0-2cdb-11f0-992a-53cdd61a1eb7.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8cd6/live/be96f6f0-2cdb-11f0-992a-53cdd61a1eb7.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="A night-vision image of troops firing their weapons in a desert landscape"></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>One SAS veteran said that killing could be an "addictive thing to do"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>The testimony, as well as new video evidence obtained by the BBC from SAS operations in Iraq in 2006, also supports previous reporting by Panorama that SAS squadrons kept count of their kills to compete with one another.</p><p>Sources told the BBC that some members of the SAS kept their own individual counts, and that one operator personally killed dozens of people on one six-month tour of Afghanistan.</p><p>"It seemed like he was trying to get a kill on every operation, every night someone got killed," a former colleague said. The operator was "notorious in the squadron, he genuinely seemed like a psychopath," the former colleague added.</p><p>In one incident that sources say became infamous inside the SAS, the operator allegedly slit the throat of an injured Afghan man after telling an officer not to shoot the man again. It was "because he wanted to go and finish the wounded guy off with his knife," another former colleague said. "He wanted to, you know, blood his knife."</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><ul><li><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp3q5xl9wqwo">Top UK Special Forces general oversaw blocking of Afghan 'war-crime' witnesses to Britain</a></li></ul></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Knowledge of the alleged crimes was not confined to small teams or individual squadrons, according to the testimony. Within the UK Special Forces command structure, "everyone knew" what was happening, said one veteran.</p><p>"I'm not taking away from personal responsibility, but everyone knew," he said. "There was implicit approval for what was happening."</p><p>To avoid scrutiny of the killings, eyewitnesses said, members of the SAS and SBS would plant so-called "drop weapons" on the bodies of the dead, to make it look as though they had been armed in the photographs routinely taken by special forces teams at the scene.</p><p>"There was a fake grenade they'd take with them onto target, it couldn't detonate," said a former SAS operator. Another veteran said operators would carry AK-47 rifles which had a folding stock because they were easier to fit into their rucksacks and "easier to bring onto a target and plant by a body".</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2>Reports were 'fiction'</h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Officers would then help to falsify post-operational reports in order to avoid scrutiny for the actions of assault teams on the ground, according to the testimony.</p><p>"We understood how to write up serious incident reviews so they wouldn't trigger a referral to the military police," one of the veterans said.</p><p>"If it looked like a shooting could represent a breach of the rules of conflict, you'd get a phone call from the legal adviser or one of the staff officers in HQ. They'd pick you up on it and help you to clarify the language. 'Do you remember someone making a sudden move?' 'Oh yeah, I do now.' That sort of thing. It was built into the way we operated."</p><p>The reports were "a fiction", another UKSF veteran said.</p><p>An intelligence officer who worked with the SBS described reports which said they had been caught in a firefight, while the photos showed bodies with "multiple clean headshots".</p><p>Falsified paperwork could help prevent an investigation by the Royal Military Police, but British special forces operations generated deep concern from Afghan commanders and Afghan government officials.</p><p>David Cameron - who made seven visits to Afghanistan as prime minister between June 2010 and November 2013, the period now under scrutiny by the SAS public inquiry, was repeatedly made aware of the concerns by Afghan President Hamid Karzai, according to multiple people who attended the meetings.</p><p>Mr Karzai "consistently, repeatedly mentioned this issue", former Afghan national security adviser Dr Rangin Dadfar Spanta told Panorama. He said Lord Cameron could have been left in no doubt that there were allegations of civilians, including children, being killed during operations carried out by UK Special Forces.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250428-123652-7bc49a8f4-web-2.20.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/539a/live/c77020c0-2ce6-11f0-8ff1-59f5dcf8e9f5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/539a/live/c77020c0-2ce6-11f0-8ff1-59f5dcf8e9f5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/539a/live/c77020c0-2ce6-11f0-8ff1-59f5dcf8e9f5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/539a/live/c77020c0-2ce6-11f0-8ff1-59f5dcf8e9f5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/539a/live/c77020c0-2ce6-11f0-8ff1-59f5dcf8e9f5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/539a/live/c77020c0-2ce6-11f0-8ff1-59f5dcf8e9f5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/539a/live/c77020c0-2ce6-11f0-8ff1-59f5dcf8e9f5.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/539a/live/c77020c0-2ce6-11f0-8ff1-59f5dcf8e9f5.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="A head-and-shoulders portrait of Bruce Houlder, a white man with grey hair, wearing a navy suit, a pink shirt and a blue tie, looking to the side of the camera with the background out of focus"></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Former director of service prosecutions Bruce Houlder said he hoped the inquiry would examine what Mr Cameron knew</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Afghan president was "so consistent with his complaints about night raids, civilian casualties and detentions that there was no senior Western diplomat or military leader who would have missed the fact that this was a major irritant for him," said Gen Douglas Lute, a former US ambassador to Nato.</p><p>Gen Lute said it would have been "extraordinarily unusual if there were a claim against British forces that the British chain of command was not aware of".</p><p>A spokesperson for Lord Cameron told Panorama that "to the best of Lord Cameron's recollection" the issues raised by President Karzai were about Nato forces in general and that "specific incidents with respect to UK Special Forces were not raised".</p><p>The spokesperson also said that it was "right that we await the official findings of the Inquiry", adding that "any suggestion that Lord Cameron colluded in covering up allegations of serious criminal wrongdoing is total nonsense."</p><p>Unlike many other countries, including the US and France, the UK has no parliamentary oversight of its elite special forces regiments.
