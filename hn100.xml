                                        <p>Amid uncertainty about frozen research aid from the National Institutes of Health, the University of Pittsburgh has put its Ph.D. admissions on ice. The school confirmed Friday that there would be no new Ph.D. offers of admission while Pitt works to understand how reduced federal aid could impact the institution.</p><p>The move comes as research universities across the country battle against the National Institutes of Health over a policy to <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/health-science-tech/2025-02-10/pitt-cmu-national-institute-health-funding" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">reduce the funding cap for ancillary research expenses</a> like building construction and maintenance as well as support staff.</p><p>The policy would reduce the cap for those indirect research costs to 15%. Pitt’s current rate is 59%. A federal judge <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/health-science-tech/2025-02-21/nih-funding-indirects-judge-stay" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">extended a temporary pause</a> on implementation of that policy Friday. But Pitt’s decision to halt admissions was made earlier in the week.</p><p>"After the announcement that NIH indirect costs would be capped at 15%, the University’s Office of the Provost temporarily paused additional Ph.D. offers of admission until the impacts of that cap were better understood,” a Pitt spokesperson said in a statement to WESA.</p><p>The pause applies to all Pitt departments, not just medical and scientific research programs. University leadership is evaluating how reduced funding could impact the school, and it’s not clear when Ph.D. offers will resume.</p><p>“The University is in the process of completing that analysis and expects to be in a position to resume offers soon," the spokesperson said.</p><p>Emails obtained by WESA show Pitt faculty informing a Ph.D. applicant about the pause, explaining that the timeline and decision-making process is unclear. The email indicates that the applicant had upcoming plans to tour the campus and was highly recommended by the department for admission.</p><p>Pitt is not the first research university to take such a drastic measure as it tries to find its financial footing amid the Trump administration’s first month. The University of Southern California paused admissions in some of its departments last week, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/19/trump-funding-freeze-grad-student-postdoc-acceptances-paused-nih-research/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">according to STAT</a>.</p><p>And <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2025/02/15/graduate-student-admissions-temporarily-paused-as-university-monitors-federal-funding/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">according to the Vanderbilt Hustler</a>, the student newspaper at Vanderbilt University, a dean at the Tennessee school announced a pause on graduate student admissions last week. The school later told the paper that admissions were not paused but steps were being taken to “balance program admissions with current student needs.”</p><p>The NIH announced the cuts earlier this month, sending shockwaves through Pittsburgh’s life sciences sector. The University of Pittsburgh said in a statement shortly after the announcement that such cuts would harm the institution's mission “irreparably.”</p><p>A <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/health-science-tech/2025-02-21/nih-grants-indirects-trump-pittsburgh" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">WESA analysis</a> found that if the indirect cost cuts were implemented for the 2024 fiscal year, the University of Pittsburgh would have seen a $115 million drop in indirect funds. Carnegie Mellon University, another major research hub in Pittsburgh, would have seen a $3 million drop. It’s unclear how the cuts would impact the schools’ 2025 budget.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, despite the courts holding off implementation of the funding cuts, WESA has found grants from the NIH are <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/health-science-tech/2025-02-21/nih-funding-indirects-judge-stay" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">already lagging significantly behind this year compared to the first few weeks of 2024</a>. Between Inauguration Day and Feb. 15, roughly $781 million have been awarded to projects at research institutions nationwide. That’s a nearly 56% decrease compared to the same period in 2024 when $1.8 billion was awarded.</p><p>And with almost all grant review meetings on indefinite hold at NIH, former staffers tell WESA the plunge in funding is likely to continue.</p>

      <h2>Understand what people need</h2>

      <p>We must begin digital projects by exploring and pinpointing the needs of the people who will use the service, and the ways the service will fit into their lives. Whether the users are members of the public or government employees, policy makers must include real people in their design process from the beginning. The needs of people — not constraints of government structures or silos — should inform technical and design decisions. We need to continually test the products we build with real people to keep us honest about what is important.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Early in the project, spend time with current and prospective users of the service</li>
  <li>Use a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors; be thoughtful about the time spent</li>
  <li>Test prototypes of solutions with real people, in the field if possible</li>
  <li>Document the findings about user goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences</li>
  <li>Share findings with the team and agency leadership</li>
  <li>Create a prioritized list of tasks the user is trying to accomplish, also known as “user stories”</li>
  <li>As the digital service is being built, regularly test it with potential users to ensure it meets people’s needs</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Who are your primary users?</li>
  <li>What user needs will this service address?</li>
  <li>Why does the user want or need this service?</li>
  <li>Which people will have the most difficulty with the service?</li>
  <li>Which research methods were used?</li>
  <li>What were the key findings?</li>
  <li>How were the findings documented? Where can future team members access the documentation?</li>
  <li>How often are you testing with real people?</li>
</ul>

    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h6>PLAY 2</h6>
      <h2>Address the whole experience, from start to finish</h2>

      <p>We need to understand the different ways people will interact with our services, including the actions they take online, through a mobile application, on a phone, or in person. Every encounter — whether it’s online or offline — should move the user closer towards their goal.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Understand the different points at which people will interact with the service – both online and in person</li>
  <li>Identify pain points in the current way users interact with the service, and prioritize these according to user needs</li>
  <li>Design the digital parts of the service so that they are integrated with the offline touch points people use to interact with the service</li>
  <li>Develop metrics that will measure how well the service is meeting user needs at each step of the service</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What are the different ways (both online and offline) that people currently accomplish the task the digital service is designed to help with?</li>
  <li>Where are user pain points in the current way people accomplish the task?</li>
  <li>Where does this specific project fit into the larger way people currently obtain the service being offered?</li>
  <li>What metrics will best indicate how well the service is working for its users?</li>
</ul>

    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h6>PLAY 3</h6>
      <h2>Make it simple and intuitive</h2>

      <p>Using a government service shouldn’t be stressful, confusing, or daunting. It’s our job to build services that are simple and intuitive enough that users succeed the first time, unaided.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Use a simple and flexible design style guide for the service. Use the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards">U.S. Web Design System</a> as a default</li>
  <li>Use the design style guide consistently for related digital services</li>
  <li>Give users clear information about where they are in each step of the process</li>
  <li>Follow accessibility best practices to ensure all people can use the service</li>
  <li>Provide users with a way to exit and return later to complete the process</li>
  <li>Use language that is familiar to the user and easy to understand</li>
  <li>Use language and design consistently throughout the service, including online and offline touch points</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What primary tasks are the user trying to accomplish?</li>
  <li>Is the language as plain and universal as possible?</li>
  <li>What languages is your service offered in?</li>
  <li>If a user needs help while using the service, how do they go about getting it?</li>
  <li>How does the service’s design visually relate to other government services?</li>
</ul>

    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h6>PLAY 4</h6>
      <h2>Build the service using agile and iterative practices</h2>

      <p>We should use an incremental, fast-paced style of software development to reduce the risk of failure. We want to get working software into users’ hands as early as possible to give the design and development team opportunities to adjust based on user feedback about the service. A critical capability is being able to automatically test and deploy the service so that new features can be added often and be put into production easily.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Ship a functioning “minimum viable product” (MVP) that solves a core user need as soon as possible, no longer than three months from the beginning of the project, using a “beta” or “test” period if needed</li>
  <li>Run usability tests frequently to see how well the service works and identify improvements that should be made</li>
  <li>Ensure the individuals building the service communicate closely using techniques such as launch meetings, strategy rooms, daily standups, and team chat tools</li>
  <li>Keep delivery teams small and focused; limit organizational layers that separate these teams from the business owners</li>
  <li>Release features and improvements multiple times each month</li>
  <li>Create a prioritized list of features and bugs, also known as the “feature backlog” and “bug backlog”</li>
  <li>Use a source code version control system</li>
  <li>Give the entire project team access to the issue tracker and version control system</li>
  <li>Use code reviews to ensure quality</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>How long did it take to ship the MVP? If it hasn’t shipped yet, when will it?</li>
  <li>How long does it take for a production deployment?</li>
  <li>How many days or weeks are in each iteration/sprint?</li>
  <li>Which version control system is being used?</li>
  <li>How are bugs tracked and tickets issued? What tool is used?</li>
  <li>How is the feature backlog managed? What tool is used?</li>
  <li>How often do you review and reprioritize the feature and bug backlog?</li>
  <li>How do you collect user feedback during development? How is that feedback used to improve the service?</li>
  <li>At each stage of usability testing, which gaps were identified in addressing user needs?</li>
</ul>

    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h6>PLAY 5</h6>
      <h2>Structure budgets and contracts to support delivery</h2>

      <p>To improve our chances of success when contracting out development work, we need to work with experienced budgeting and contracting officers. In cases where we use third parties to help build a service, a well-defined contract can facilitate good development practices like conducting a research and prototyping phase, refining product requirements as the service is built, evaluating open source alternatives, ensuring frequent delivery milestones, and allowing the flexibility to purchase cloud computing resources.</p>

<p><a href="https://techfarhub.cio.gov/handbook/">The TechFAR Handbook</a> provides a detailed explanation of the flexibilities in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) that can help agencies implement this play.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Budget includes research, discovery, and prototyping activities</li>
  <li>Contract is structured to request frequent deliverables, not multi-month milestones</li>
  <li>Contract is structured to hold vendors accountable to deliverables</li>
  <li>Contract gives the government delivery team enough flexibility to adjust feature prioritization and delivery schedule as the project evolves</li>
  <li>Contract ensures open source solutions are evaluated when technology choices are made</li>
  <li>Contract specifies that software and data generated by third parties remains under our control, and can be reused and released to the public as appropriate and in accordance with the law</li>
  <li>Contract allows us to use tools, services, and hosting from vendors with a variety of pricing models, including fixed fees and variable models like “pay-for-what-you-use” services</li>
  <li>Contract specifies a warranty period where defects uncovered by the public are addressed by the vendor at no additional cost to the government</li>
  <li>Contract includes a transition of services period and transition-out plan</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What is the scope of the project? What are the key deliverables?</li>
  <li>What are the milestones? How frequent are they?</li>
  <li>What are the performance metrics defined in the contract (e.g., response time, system uptime, time period to address priority issues)?</li>
</ul>

    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h6>PLAY 6</h6>
      <h2>Assign one leader and hold that person accountable</h2>

      <p>There must be a single product owner who has the authority and responsibility to assign tasks and work elements; make business, product, and technical decisions; and be accountable for the success or failure of the overall service. This product owner is ultimately responsible for how well the service meets the needs of its users, which is how a service should be evaluated. The product owner is responsible for ensuring that features are built and managing the feature and bug backlogs.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>A product owner has been identified</li>
  <li>All stakeholders agree that the product owner has the authority to assign tasks and make decisions about features and technical implementation details</li>
  <li>The product owner has a product management background with technical experience to assess alternatives and weigh tradeoffs</li>
  <li>The product owner has a work plan that includes budget estimates and identifies funding sources</li>
  <li>The product owner has a strong relationship with the contracting officer</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Who is the product owner?</li>
  <li>What organizational changes have been made to ensure the product owner has sufficient authority over and support for the project?</li>
  <li>What does it take for the product owner to add or remove a feature from the service?</li>
</ul>

    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h6>PLAY 7</h6>
      <h2>Bring in experienced teams</h2>

      <p>We need talented people working in government who have experience creating modern digital services. This includes bringing in seasoned product managers, engineers, and designers. When outside help is needed, our teams should work with contracting officers who understand how to evaluate third-party technical competency so our teams can be paired with contractors who are good at both building and delivering effective digital services. The makeup and experience requirements of the team will vary depending on the scope of the project.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Member(s) of the team have experience building popular, high-traffic digital services</li>
  <li>Member(s) of the team have experience designing mobile and web applications</li>
  <li>Member(s) of the team have experience using automated testing frameworks</li>
  <li>Member(s) of the team have experience with modern development and operations (DevOps) techniques like continuous integration and continuous deployment</li>
  <li>Member(s) of the team have experience securing digital services</li>
  <li>A Federal contracting officer is on the internal team if a third party will be used for development work</li>
  <li>A Federal budget officer is on the internal team or is a partner</li>
  <li>The appropriate privacy, civil liberties, and/or legal advisor for the department or agency is a partner</li>
</ol>

    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h6>PLAY 8</h6>
      <h2>Choose a modern technology stack</h2>

      <p>The technology decisions we make need to enable development teams to work efficiently and enable services to scale easily and cost-effectively. Our choices for hosting infrastructure, databases, software frameworks, programming languages and the rest of the technology stack should seek to avoid vendor lock-in and match what successful modern consumer and enterprise software companies would choose today. In particular, digital services teams should consider using open source, cloud-based, and commodity solutions across the technology stack, because of their widespread adoption and support by successful consumer and enterprise technology companies in the private sector.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Choose software frameworks that are commonly used by private-sector companies creating similar services</li>
  <li>Whenever possible, ensure that software can be deployed on a variety of commodity hardware types</li>
  <li>Ensure that each project has clear, understandable instructions for setting up a local development environment, and that team members can be quickly added or removed from projects</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.obamawhitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/egov_docs/memotociostechnologyneutrality.pdf">Consider open source software solutions</a> at every layer of the stack</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What is your development stack and why did you choose it?</li>
  <li>Which databases are you using and why did you choose them?</li>
  <li>How long does it take for a new team member to start contributing?</li>
</ul>

    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h6>PLAY 9</h6>
      <h2>Deploy in a flexible hosting environment</h2>

      <p>Our services should be deployed on flexible infrastructure, where resources can be provisioned in real-time to meet spikes in traffic and user demand. Our digital services are crippled when we host them in data centers that market themselves as “cloud hosting” but require us to manage and maintain hardware directly. This outdated practice wastes time, weakens our disaster recovery plans, and results in significantly higher costs.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Resources are provisioned on demand</li>
  <li>Resources scale based on real-time user demand</li>
  <li>Resources are provisioned through an API</li>
  <li>Resources are available in multiple regions</li>
  <li>We only pay for resources we use</li>
  <li>Static assets are served through a content delivery network</li>
  <li>Application is hosted on commodity hardware</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Where is your service hosted?</li>
  <li>What hardware does your service use to run?</li>
  <li>What is the demand or usage pattern for your service?</li>
  <li>What happens to your service when it experiences a surge in traffic or load?</li>
  <li>How much capacity is available in your hosting environment?</li>
  <li>How long does it take you to provision a new resource, like an application server?</li>
  <li>How have you designed your service to scale based on demand?</li>
  <li>How are you paying for your hosting infrastructure (e.g., by the minute, hourly, daily, monthly, fixed)?</li>
  <li>Is your service hosted in multiple regions, availability zones, or data centers?</li>
  <li>In the event of a catastrophic disaster to a datacenter, how long will it take to have the service operational?</li>
  <li>What would be the impact of a prolonged downtime window?</li>
  <li>What data redundancy do you have built into the system, and what would be the impact of a catastrophic data loss?</li>
  <li>How often do you need to contact a person from your hosting provider to get resources or to fix an issue?</li>
</ul>

    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h6>PLAY 10</h6>
      <h2>Automate testing and deployments</h2>

      <p>Today, developers write automated scripts that can verify thousands of scenarios in minutes and then deploy updated code into production environments multiple times a day. They use automated performance tests which simulate surges in traffic to identify performance bottlenecks. While manual tests and quality assurance are still necessary, automated tests provide consistent and reliable protection against unintentional regressions, and make it possible for developers to confidently release frequent updates to the service.</p>

      <h2>Manage security and privacy through reusable processes</h2>

      <p>Our digital services have to protect sensitive information and keep systems secure. This is typically a process of continuous review and improvement which should be built into the development and maintenance of the service. At the start of designing a new service or feature, the team lead should engage the appropriate privacy, security, and legal officer(s) to discuss the type of information collected, how it should be secured, how long it is kept, and how it may be used and shared. The sustained engagement of a privacy specialist helps ensure that personal data is properly managed. In addition, a key process to building a secure service is comprehensively testing and certifying the components in each layer of the technology stack for security vulnerabilities, and then to re-use these same pre-certified components for multiple services.</p>

<p>The following checklist provides a starting point, but teams should work closely with their privacy specialist and security engineer to meet the needs of the specific service.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Contact the appropriate privacy or legal officer of the department or agency to determine whether a System of Records Notice (SORN), Privacy Impact Assessment, or other review should be conducted</li>
  <li>Determine, in consultation with a records officer, what data is collected and why, how it is used or shared, how it is stored and secured, and how long it is kept</li>
  <li>Determine, in consultation with a privacy specialist, whether and how users are notified about how personal information is collected and used, including whether a privacy policy is needed and where it should appear, and how users will be notified in the event of a security breach</li>
  <li>Consider whether the user should be able to access, delete, or remove their information from the service</li>
  <li>“Pre-certify” the hosting infrastructure used for the project using FedRAMP</li>
  <li>Use deployment scripts to ensure configuration of production environment remains consistent and controllable</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Does the service collect personal information from the user?  How is the user notified of this collection?</li>
  <li>Does it collect more information than necessary? Could the data be used in ways an average user wouldn’t expect?</li>
  <li>How does a user access, correct, delete, or remove personal information?</li>
  <li>Will any of the personal information stored in the system be shared with other services, people, or partners?</li>
  <li>How and how often is the service tested for security vulnerabilities?</li>
  <li>How can someone from the public report a security issue?</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Use data to drive decisions</h2>

      <p>At every stage of a project, we should measure how well our service is working for our users. This includes measuring how well a system performs and how people are interacting with it in real-time. Our teams and agency leadership should carefully watch these metrics to find issues and identify which bug fixes and improvements should be prioritized. Along with monitoring tools, a feedback mechanism should be in place for people to report issues directly.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Monitor system-level resource utilization in real time</li>
  <li>Monitor system performance in real-time (e.g. response time, latency, throughput, and error rates)</li>
  <li>Ensure monitoring can measure median, 95th percentile, and 98th percentile performance</li>
  <li>Create automated alerts based on this monitoring</li>
  <li>Track concurrent users in real-time, and monitor user behaviors in the aggregate to determine how well the service meets user needs</li>
  <li>Publish metrics internally</li>
  <li>Publish metrics externally</li>
  <li>Use an experimentation tool that supports multivariate testing in production</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What are the key metrics for the service?</li>
  <li>How have these metrics performed over the life of the service?</li>
  <li>Which system monitoring tools are in place?</li>
  <li>What is the targeted average response time for your service? What percent of requests take more than 1 second, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, and 8 seconds?</li>
  <li>What is the average response time and percentile breakdown (percent of requests taking more than 1s, 2s, 4s, and 8s) for the top 10 transactions?</li>
  <li>What is the volume of each of your service’s top 10 transactions? What is the percentage of transactions started vs. completed?</li>
  <li>What is your service’s monthly uptime target?</li>
  <li>What is your service’s monthly uptime percentage, including scheduled maintenance? Excluding scheduled maintenance?</li>
  <li>How does your team receive automated alerts when incidents occur?</li>
  <li>How does your team respond to incidents? What is your post-mortem process?</li>
  <li>Which tools are in place to measure user behavior?</li>
  <li>What tools or technologies are used for A/B testing?</li>
  <li>How do you measure customer satisfaction?</li>

      <h2>Default to open</h2>

      <p>When we collaborate in the open and publish our data publicly, we can improve Government together. By building services more openly and publishing open data, we simplify the public’s access to government services and information, allow the public to contribute easily, and enable reuse by entrepreneurs, nonprofits, other agencies, and the public.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Offer users a mechanism to report bugs and issues, and be responsive to these reports</li>
  <li>Provide datasets to the public, in their entirety, through bulk downloads and APIs (application programming interfaces)</li>
  <li>Ensure that data from the service is explicitly in the public domain, and that rights are waived globally via an international public domain dedication, such as the “Creative Commons Zero” waiver</li>
  <li>Catalog data in the agency’s enterprise data inventory and add any public datasets to the agency’s public data listing</li>
  <li>Ensure that we maintain the rights to all data developed by third parties in a manner that is releasable and reusable at no cost to the public</li>
  <li>Ensure that we maintain contractual rights to all custom software developed by third parties in a manner that is publishable and reusable at no cost</li>
  <li>When appropriate, create a versioned API for third parties and internal users to interact with the service directly</li>
  <li>When appropriate, publish source code of projects or components online</li>
  <li>When appropriate, share your development process and progress publicly</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>How are you collecting user feedback for bugs and issues?</li>
  <li>If there is an API, what capabilities does it provide? Is it versioned? Who uses it? How is it documented?</li>
  <li>If the codebase has not been released under an open source license, explain why.</li>
  <li>What components are made available to the public as open source?</li>
  <li>What datasets are made available to the public?</li>

	<p>Penn directed department chairs to significantly reduce admissions rates across graduate programs in the face of federal research funding cuts, multiple faculty members told The Daily Pennsylvanian.
</p>
<p>On Friday, Penn notified department chairs that it will cut admissions across graduate programs, a decision faculty members say was made after programs had already accepted students. Professors expressed frustration over the lack of transparency from the University, with some attributing the cuts to broader funding issues — including a proposed $240 million <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2025/02/penn-uncertainty-remains-nih-funding-lawsuit-research" target="_blank">funding reduction</a> from the National Institutes of Health — and warned that the decision will impact Penn’s research and educational mission, particularly within the School of Arts and Sciences.

</center>

		
<p>Requests for comment were left with a University spokesperson and a spokesperson from the Office of the Provost.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>A Penn professor, who requested anonymity due to fear of retribution, told the DP that the decision appeared to be “last minute” and came after departments had already informed the University of the students who were selected for graduate programs.&nbsp;
				</p>

	
	
<p>“We go through hundreds of applications, we interviewed dozens of finalists, and basically all that work was just for naught,” the professor said. “We just wasted half of those people’s time because our list just got cut by more than half.”
</p>
<p>The professor added that the University “pulled the rug out” from many faculty members, some of whom had already offered acceptances to students they had thought were admitted — only to now face the possibility of having to cut those students from the program. The professor said that their department — which submitted its choices for admits to its graduate program on Feb. 14 — will be forced to rescind the acceptances of 10 of the 17 students.
	</p>

</center>
	<hr>

			  		
<p>“This whole thing about rescinding offers is just absolutely deplorable,” the professor said.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The DP could not confirm how many schools and departments will be affected by these cuts to admissions at the time of publication. In statements and interviews with the DP, SAS faculty members said that all departments within the school have been notified to reduce the size of their graduate programs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Another Penn professor — who also requested anonymity due to a fear of retribution — wrote in a statement to the DP that SAS called an emergency meeting on Friday evening to address the admissions cuts and “decide on collective action.”
</p>
<p>“On the whole, people were very upset, complaining about lack of transparency and consultation and about decisions being imposed by the [Penn] administration without proper explanation,” the professor wrote.
</p>
<p>The professor noted that many faculty members voiced concerns about how the University’s actions will impact Penn’s “educational mission” and were upset about a “lack of proportionality between the relatively small percentage of the lost income versus the large 35% cut in [graduate] programs.”
</p>
<p>While the University did not inform the departments why it was instituting funding cuts, a professor noted that it could be a response to 1968 Wharton graduate and President Donald Trump’s executive actions, <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2025/01/penn-graduate-worker-union-rally-contract" target="_blank">graduate students’ unionization efforts</a>, or simply because “[Penn doesn’t] believe in the humanities.”
</p>
<p>While some graduate chairs at the Friday meeting expressed concerns over graduate programs “being punished for unionization,” the majority of faculty members did not “seem to agree” that the cuts were in response to organized labor efforts, according to a professor who attended the meeting.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Penn has seen a recent uptick in campus union organizing. In May 2024, Penn’s graduate student workers <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2024/05/penn-graduation-issue-graduate-workers-union-roundup" target="_blank">voted to unionize</a> by an overwhelming majority. Last month, following continued engagement from union groups, around 200 people gathered at a <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2025/01/penn-graduate-worker-union-rally-contract" target="_blank">rally in front of College Hall</a> in support of securing a graduate student worker contract with the University.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>A Perelman School of Medicine professor, who requested anonymity due to fear of retribution, said that the school was told to make cuts to Ph.D. programs prior to the NIH funding cuts, but additional cuts have been implemented following executive actions from the Trump administration. The professor expressed concern that Penn may have to cut other programs within the school to account for the loss of federal funding.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>On Feb. 7, the NIH<a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2025/02/penn-uncertainty-remains-nih-funding-lawsuit-research" target="_blank"> proposed a funding cut</a> that could cost Penn $240 million. While a judge temporarily halted the changes following Penn and 12 other universities bringing a lawsuit against the NIH, the cut — a 15% cap on indirect costs — could stunt the development of graduate programs.
		</p>

		
<p>Indirect funding typically covers overhead research expenses, including equipment, facilities, and administrative expenditures that cannot be claimed as direct costs. Although the NIH does not fund individual graduate programs, indirect grants support academic staff, and cuts could spread departmental resources thin.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In a Feb. 11 <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2025/02/penn-jameson-addresses-lawsuit-nih-funding-cuts" target="_blank">statement</a> responding to the NIH funding cut, Interim Penn President Larry Jameson reiterated the University’s commitment to ongoing research.
</p>
<p>“I want to emphasize that Penn has long been a leader in research, resilience, and adaptation,” Jameson wrote in an email to the Penn community. “Our community is strong, and we will continue our groundbreaking research, advocate forcefully, and take the steps needed to sustain our mission.”

 		<p>I think it is important to have a bias for action. Like anything else, this is something you can make a habit of. Moving forward allows you to make progress. I don’t know about you, but I’ve frozen up in the past not knowing what the right path was for me. Moving forward, even the smallest possible step, helped break that stasis.</p>
<p>One habit I like is to ask for no, not yes. Note that this is based on my experience at small companies (&lt; 200 employees) where a lot of my experience has been. I’m not sure how it’d work in a big company, non-profit, or government.</p>
<p>When you have something you want to do and that you feel is in scope for your position, but you want a bit of reassurance or to let the boss know what you are up to, it’s common to reach out and ask them for permission. Don’t. Don’t ask for a yes. Instead, <strong>offer a chance to say no, but with a deadline</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s see how this works.</p>
<p>Suppose I want to set up a new GitHub action that I feel will really improve the quality of our software. This isn’t whimsy, I’ve done some research and tested it locally. I may have even asked a former colleague how they used this GitHub action.</p>
<p>But I’m not quite sure. I want to let my boss know that I’ll be modifying the repository.</p>
<p>I could say “hey, boss, can we install action X? It’ll help with the XYZ problems we’ve been having.”</p>
<p>If you have a busy boss (and most people do), this is going to require a bit of work on their part to say “yes”.</p>
<p>They’ll want to review the XYZ problem, think about how X will solve it and maybe do some thinking or prioritization about how this fits in with other work. Or maybe they’ll want you to share what you know. It may fall off their plate. You will probably have to remind them a few times to get around to saying “yes”. It might be a more pressing issue for you</p>
<p>Now, let’s take the alternative approach.”Hey, boss, I am going to install action X, which should solve the XYZ problems we’ve been having. Will take care of this on Monday unless I hear differently from you.”</p>
<p>Do you see the change in tone?</p>
<p>You are saying (without being explicit) that you “got it” and are going to handle this issue. The boss can still weigh in if they want to, but they don’t have to. If they forget about it or other issues pop up, you still proceed. This lets you keep moving forward and solving problems while keeping the boss informed and allowing them to add their two cents if it is important enough.</p>
<p>You can also use this approach with a group of people.</p>
<p>By the way, the deadline is critical too. Which would you respond to more quickly, if it was Jan 15, all other things being equal and assuming a response was needed?</p>
<ul>
<li>“I’m going to do task X.”</li>
<li>“I’m going to do task X on Jan 17.”</li>
<li>“I’m going to do task X on Feb 15.”</li>
</ul>
<p>I would respond to the second one, which has a deadline in the near future. I think that is the way most folks work.</p>
<p>Again, pursue this approach for problems you feel are in the scope of your role but that you want to inform the boss about. It’s great when you want to <strong>offer</strong> a chance for feedback, but you are confident enough in the course of action that you don’t <strong>need</strong> feedback.</p>

<p>
    This is a list of software and ideas developed or maintained by the OpenBSD
    project, sorted in order of approximate introduction. Some of them are
    explained in detail in our <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/events.html">research papers</a>.
</p><hr>

<h3>Concepts</h3>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ipsec.4">ipsec(4)</a>:
	Started by John Ioannidis, Angelos D. Keromytis, Niels Provos, and
	Niklas Hallqvist, imported February 20, 1997.  OpenBSD was the first
	free operating system to provide an IPSec stack.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/inet6.4">inet6(4)</a>:
	First complete integration and adoption of IPv6 led by
	"Itojun" (Dr. Junichiro Hagino) [WIDE/KAME], Craig Metz [NRL], and
	Angelos D. Keromytis starting Jan 6, 1999.
	Almost fully operational Jun 6, 1999 during the
	<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/hackathons.html">first OpenBSD hackathon</a>.
	OpenBSD 2.7.
    </li><li><strong>Privilege separation</strong>:
	First implemented by
	<a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html">Niels Provos</a>
	and Markus Friedl in OpenSSH in March 2002, released with OpenBSD 3.2.
	The concept is now used in many OpenBSD programs, for example
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.8">dhclient(8)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpd.8">dhcpd(8)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dvmrpd.8">dvmrpd(8)</a>,

    </li><li><strong>Privilege revocation</strong>:
	Related to the work on privilege separation, some programs were refactored
	to drop privileges while holding onto a tricky resource such as a raw socket,
	reserved port, or modification-locked bpf(4) descriptor,
	for example
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ping.8">ping(8)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/traceroute.8">traceroute(8)</a>,
	etc.
    </li><li><strong>Stack protector</strong>:
	Developed since 2001 as "propolice" by Hiroaki Etoh. Integrated, and
	implemented for additional hardware platforms, by Federico G. Schwindt,
	Miod Vallat and Theo de Raadt.  OpenBSD 3.3 was the first operating
	system to enable it systemwide by default.
    </li><li><strong>W^X</strong>:
	First used for sparc, sparc64, alpha, and hppa in OpenBSD 3.3.
	Strictly enforced by default since OpenBSD 6.0: a program can only
	violate it if the executable is marked with <code>PT_OPENBSD_WXNEEDED</code>
	and it is located on a filesystem mounted with the <code>wxallowed</code>
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mount.8">mount(8)</a> option.
    </li><li><strong>GOT and PLT protection</strong> by ld.so:
	first done as part of the W^X work in OpenBSD 3.3, by Dale Rahn and
	Theo de Raadt. The GOT and PLT regions are read-only outside of ld.so
	itself. Extended to the .init/.fini sections (constructors and
	destructors) in OpenBSD 3.4.
    </li><li><strong>ASLR</strong>:
	OpenBSD 3.4 was the first widely used operating system to
	provide it by default.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/gcc-local.1">gcc-local(1)</a>
	__attribute__((__bounded__)) static analysis annotation
	and checking mechanism:
	Started by Anil Madhavapeddy on June 26, 2003
	and ported to GCC 4 by Nicholas Marriott.
	First released with OpenBSD 3.4.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/malloc.3">malloc(3)</a>
	randomization implemented by Thierry Deval. Guard pages and randomized (delayed) free added by Ted Unangst.
	Reimplemented by <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/eurobsdcon2009/otto-malloc.pdf">Otto Moerbeek</a>
	for OpenBSD 4.4.
    </li><li><strong>Position-independent executables (PIE)</strong>:
	OpenBSD 5.3 was the first widely used operating system to enable it
	globally by default, on seven hardware platforms.
	Implemented in November 2008 by
	<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/nycbsdcon08-pie/">Kurt Miller</a>
	and enabled by default by
	<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/asiabsdcon2015-pie-slides.pdf">Pascal Stumpf</a>
	in August 2012.
    </li><li><strong>Random-data memory</strong>:
	the ability to specify that a variable should be initialized
	at load time with random byte values (placed into a new ELF
	<b>.openbsd.randomdata</b> section) was implemented in
	OpenBSD 5.3 by Matthew Dempsky.
    </li><li><strong>Stack protector per shared object</strong>:
	using the random-data memory feature, each shared object was given its
	own stack protector cookie in OpenBSD 5.3 by Matthew Dempsky.
    </li><li><strong>Static-PIE</strong>:
	Position-independent static binaries for /bin, /sbin and ramdisks.
	Implemented for OpenBSD 5.7 by Kurt Miller and Mark Kettenis.
    </li><li><strong>SROP</strong>
	(<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sigreturn.2">sigreturn(2)</a>
	oriented programming) mitigation: attacks researched by
	<a href="https://www.cs.vu.nl/~herbertb/papers/srop_sp14.pdf">Eric Bosman</a>
	and Herbert Bos in 2014, solution implemented by Theo de Raadt in May 2016,
	enabled by default since OpenBSD 6.0.
    </li><li><strong>Library order randomization</strong>:
	In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc.8">rc(8)</a>, re-link
	<code>libc.so</code>, <code>libcrypto</code>, and <code>ld.so</code>
	on startup, placing the objects in a random order.
	Theo de Raadt and Robert Peichaer, May 2016,
	enabled by default since OpenBSD 6.0 and 6.2.
    </li><li>Kernel-assisted lazy-binding for W^X safety in multi-threaded programs.
	A new syscall <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/kbind.2">kbind(2)</a>
	permits lazy-binding to be W^X safe in multi-threaded programs.
	Implemented for OpenBSD 5.9 by Philip Guenther in July 2015.
    </li><li>Process layouts in memory tightened to remove execute permission from
	all segmented, non-instruction data and to remove write permission from
	data that is only modified during loading and relocation.
	By combining the RELRO (Read-Only after Relocation) design from the
	GNU project with the original ASLR work from OpenBSD 3.3 and
	strict lazy-binding work from OpenBSD 5.9, this is applied to not
	just a subset of programs and libraries but rather to all programs
	and libraries.
	Implemented for OpenBSD 6.1 by Philip Guenther in August 2016.
    </li><li>Use of <strong>fork+exec in privilege separated programs</strong>. The
	strategy is to give each process a fresh &amp; unique address space for
	ASLR, stack protector -- as protection against address space discovery attacks.
	Implemented first by
	Damien Miller (<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> 2004),
	Claudio Jeker (<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a>, 2015),
	Eric Faurot (<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd.8">smtpd(8)</a>, 2016),
	Rafael Zalamena (various, 2016), and others.
    </li><li><strong>trapsleds</strong>:
	Reduction of incidental NOP instructions/sequences in the instruction
	stream which could be useful potentially for ROP attack methods to
	inaccurately target gadgets. These NOP sequences are converted into
	trap sequences where possible. Todd Mortimer and Theo de Raadt, June
	2017.
    </li><li><strong>Kernel relinking at boot</strong>:
	the .o files of the kernel are relinked in random order from a
	link-kit, before every reboot. This provides substantial interior
	randomization in the kernel's text and data segments for layout and
	relative branches/calls.  Basically a unique address space for each
	kernel boot, similar to the userland fork+exec model described above
	but for the kernel.  Theo de Raadt, June 2017.
    </li><li>Rearranged i386/amd64 register allocator order in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/clang.1">clang(1)</a>
	to reduce polymorphic RET instructions:
	Todd Mortimer, November 20, 2017.
    </li><li>Reencoding of i386/amd64 instruction sequences to avoid
	embedded polymorphic RET instructions.  Enhancements to
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/clang.1">clang(1)</a>
	Todd Mortimer, April 28, 2018 and onwards.
    </li><li><b>MAP_STACK</b> addition to
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mmap.2">mmap(2)</a>
	allows opportunistic verification that the stack-register
	points at stack memory, therefore catching pivots to non-stack
	memory (sometimes used in ROP attacks).
	Theo de Raadt, April 12, 2018.
    </li><li><b>RETGUARD</b> is a replacement for the <b>stack-protector</b>
	which uses a per-function random cookie (located in the read-only ELF
	<b>.openbsd.randomdata</b> section) to consistency-check the
	return address on the stack.  Implemented for amd64 and arm64
	by Todd Mortimer in OpenBSD 6.4, for mips64 in OpenBSD 6.7, and
	powerpc/powerpc64 in OpenBSD 6.9.  amd64 system call stubs also
	protected in OpenBSD 7.3.
    </li><li><b>MAP_CONCEAL</b> addition to
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mmap.2">mmap(2)</a>
	disallows memory pages to be written to core dumps, preventing
	accidental exposure of private information.
	Theo de Raadt, Mark Kettenis and Scott Soule Cheloha,
	February 2, 2019.
    </li><li>Similar to the opportunistic verification in <b>MAP_STACK</b>,
	system-calls can no longer be performed from PROT_WRITE memory.
	Theo de Raadt, June 2, 2019.
    </li><li>System calls may only be performed from selected code regions
        (main program, ld.so, libc.so, and sigtramp).  The libc.so region
	is setup by <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/msyscall.2">msyscall(2)</a>.
	Theo de Raadt, November 28, 2019.<br>
	This mechanism was removed because later work on immutable memory +
	pinned system calls was even better.
    </li><li>Permissions (RWX, MAP_STACK, etc) on address space regions can be
	made immutable, so that <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mmap.2">mmap(2)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mprotect.2">mprotect(2)</a> or
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/munmap.2">munmap(2)</a> fail with
	EPERM. Most of the program static address space is now automatically
	immutable (main program, ld.so, main stack, load-time shared libraries,
	and dlopen()'d libraries mapped without RTLD_NODELETE).  Programmers
	can request non-immutable static data using the "openbsd.mutable" section,
	or manually bring immutability to (page aligned heap objects) using
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mimmutable.2">mimmutable(2)</a>.
	Theo de Raadt, Dec 4, 2022.
    </li><li>sshd random relinking at boot. Theo de Raadt. Jan 18, 2023.
    </li><li>Some architectures now have non-readable code ("xonly"), both from
	the perspective of userland reading its own memory, or the kernel
	trying to read memory in a system call.  Many sloppy practices in
	userland code had to be repaired to allow this.  The linker option
	<b>--execute-only</b> is enabled by default. In order of
	development: arm64, riscv64, hppa, amd64,
	powerpc64, powerpc (G5 only), octeon.
	sparc64 (sun4u only, unfinished).
	Mark Kettenis, Theo de Raadt, Visa Hankala, Miod Vallat,
	Dave Voutila, George Koehler in kernel and base, and
	Theo Buehler, Robert Nagy, Christian Weisgerber in ports.
	Dec 2022 - Feb 2023, still ongoing.
    </li><li>On all architectures which lack hardware-enforcement of xonly,
	system calls are now prevented from reading (via copyin/copyinst)
	inside the program's main text, ld.so text, sigtramp text, or
	libc.so text.
	Theo de Raadt, Jan 2023.
    </li><li>Architectures which lack xonly mmu-enforcement can still benefit
	from switching to --execute-only binaries if the cpu generates
	different traps for instruction-fetch versus data-fetch.  The
	VM system will not allow memory to be read before it was
	executed which is valuable together with library relinking.
	Architectures switched over include loongson.
	Theo de Raadt, Feb 2023.
    </li><li>ld.so and crt0 register the location of the
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/execve.2">execve(2)</a>
	libc syscall stub with the kernel using
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pinsyscall.2">pinsyscall(2)</a>,
	after which the kernel only accepts an execve call from that
	specific location. Theo de Raadt, Feb 2023. Made redundant by
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pinsyscalls.2">pinsyscalls(2)</a>
        which handles all system calls.
    </li><li>Mandatory enforcement of indirect branch targets (BTI on arm64,
        IBT on Intel amd64), unless a linker flag (-Wl,-z,nobtcfi) requests
        no enforcement.
    </li><li>The kernel and ld.so register the precise entry location of
	every system call used by a program, as described in the
	new ELF section <b>.openbsd.syscalls</b> inside ld.so and
	libc.so.  ld.so uses the new syscall
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pinsyscalls.2">pinsyscalls(2)</a>
        to tell the kernel the precise entry location of system calls in libc.so.
	Since all syscall entries are now known to the kernel, the
	pininsyscall(SYS_execve) interface becomes redundant.
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/msyscall.2">msyscall(2)</a> mechanism
	also becomes redundant (and is removed a bit later), because immutable
	memory + pinsyscalls together are cheaper and more effective targeting.
	Theo de Raadt, Jan 2024.
    </li><li><b>-fret-clean</b> is a clang extension that, upon return from a function
	cleans the return value off the stack (one of many information leaks which
	can be used to determine where functions in a different DSO reside).
	The kernel, libc, libcrypto, and ld.so(1) are compiled with this option.
	amd64 only, for now.

<h2>
Why Icons Alone Aren’t Enough
</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_a7eb7cf1ab024efcb17c380ef69c53f4/_image_cache/8b6170ad-2d4d-4c3b-ade6-6f278b48b825.svg" width="800" height="650">
</p>
<p>
I’m a firm believer in text labels.
</p>
<p>
Interfaces are over-stuffed with icons. The more icons we have to scan over, the more brain power we put toward making sense of them rather than using the tools they represent. This slows us down, not just once, but over and over again.
</p>
<p>
While it may feel duplicative to add a text label, the reality is that few icons are self-sufficient in communicating meaning.
</p>
<h2>
The Problems that Icons Create
</h2>
<p>
<b>1. Few icons communicate a clear, singular meaning immediately</b>
</p>
<p>
It’s easy to say that a <i>good</i> icon will communicate meaning — or that if an icon needs a text label, it’s not doing its job. But that doesn’t take into consideration the burden that icons — <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i> — put on people trying to navigate interfaces.
</p>
<p>
Even the simplest icons can create ambiguity. While a trash can icon reliably communicates “delete,” what about the common pencil icon. Does it mean create? Edit? Write? Draw? Context can help with disambiguation, but not always, and that contextual interpretation requires additional cognitive effort.
</p>
<p>
When an icon’s meaning isn’t immediately clear, it slows down our orientation within an interface and the use of its features. Each encounter requires a split-second of processing that might seem negligible but accumulates across interactions.
</p>
<p>
<b>2. The more icons within an interface, the more difficult it can be to navigate.</b>
</p>
<p>
As feature sets grow, we often resort to increasingly abstract or subtle visual distinctions between icons. What might have worked with 5-7 core functions becomes unmanageable at 15-20 features. Users must differentiate between various forms of creation, sharing, saving, and organizing - all through pictorial representation alone.
</p>
<p>
The burden of communication increases for each individual icon as an interface’s feature set expands. It becomes increasingly difficult to communicate specific functions with icons alone, especially when distinguishing between similar actions like creating and editing, saving and archiving, or uploading and downloading.
</p>
<p>
<b>3. Icons function as an interface-specific language within a broader ecosystem.</b>
</p>
<p>
Interfaces operate within other interfaces. Your application may run within a browser that also runs within an operating system. Users must navigate multiple levels of interface complexity, most of which you cannot control. When creating bespoke icons, you force users to learn a new visual language while still maintaining awareness of established conventions.
</p>
<p>
This creates particular challenges with standardized icon sets. When we use established systems like Google’s Material Design, an icon that represents one function in our interface might represent something entirely different in another application. This cross-context confusion adds to the cognitive load of icon interpretation.
</p>
<h2>
Why Text Labeling Helps Your Interface
</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_a7eb7cf1ab024efcb17c380ef69c53f4/_image_cache/e517c845-e798-4eef-af64-079e7ae3aa8e.svg" width="800" height="650"></p>
<p>
<b>1. Text alone is usually more efficient.</b>
</p>
<p>
Our brains process familiar words holistically rather than letter-by-letter, making them incredibly efficient information carriers. We’ve spent our lives learning to recognize words instantly, while most app icons require new visual vocabulary.
</p>
<p>
Scanning text is fundamentally easier than scanning icons. A stacked list of text requires only a one-directional scan (top-to-bottom), while icon grids demand bi-directional scanning (top-to-bottom and left-to-right). This efficiency becomes particularly apparent in mobile interfaces, where similar-looking app icons can create a visually confusing grid.
</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_a7eb7cf1ab024efcb17c380ef69c53f4/_image_cache/dee196a0-9ba7-4324-8a62-86808dba2d9d.svg" width="800" height="650"></p>
<p>
<b>2. Text can make icons more efficient.</b>
</p>
<p>
The example above comes from <a href="http://www.magnolia-made.com/" target="_blank">Magnolia</a>, an application I designed. On the left is the side navigation panel without labels. On the right is the same panel with text labels. Magnolia is an extremely niche tool with highly specific features that align with the needs of research and planning teams who develop account briefs. Without the labels, the people who we created Magnolia for would likely find the navigation system confusing.
</p>
<p>
Adding text labels to icons serves two purposes: it clarifies meaning and provides greater creative freedom. When an icon’s meaning is reinforced by text, users can scan more quickly and confidently. Additionally, designers can focus more on the unity of their interface’s visual language when they’re not relying on icons alone to communicate function.
</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_a7eb7cf1ab024efcb17c380ef69c53f4/_image_cache/5ba58f0b-6f27-493b-a156-69a0eeb34649.svg" width="899" height="651"></p>
<p>
<b>3. Icons are effective anchors in text-heavy applications.</b>
</p>
<p>
Above is another example from <a href="http://www.magnolia-made.com/" target="_blank">Magnolia</a>. Notice how the list of options on the right (Export, Regenerate, and History) stands out because of the icons, but the text labels make it immediately clear what these things do.
</p>
<p>
See, this isn’t an argument for eliminating icons entirely. Icons serve an important role as visual landmarks, helping to differentiate functional areas from content areas. Especially in text-heavy applications, icons help pull the eye toward interactive elements.
</p>
<p>
The combination of icon and text label creates clearer affordances than either element alone.
</p>
<h2>
Finding the Balance
</h2>
<p>
Every time we choose between an icon and a text label, we’re making a choice about cognitive load. We’re deciding how much mental energy people will spend interpreting our interfaces rather than using them. While a purely iconic interface might seem simple and more attractive, it often creates an invisible tax on attention and understanding.
</p>
<p>
The solution, of course, isn’t found in a “perfect” icon, nor in abandoning icons entirely. Icons remain powerful tools for creating visual hierarchy and differentiation. Instead, we need to be more thoughtful about when and how we deploy them. The best interfaces recognize that icons and text aren’t competing approaches but complementary tools that work best in harmony.
</p>
<p>
This means considering not just the immediate context of our own interfaces, but the broader ecosystem in which they exist. Our applications don’t exist in isolation — they’re part of a complex digital environment where users are constantly switching between different contexts, each with its own visual language.
</p>
<p>
The next time you’re tempted to create yet another icon, or to remove text labels, remember: the most elegant solution isn’t always the one that <i>looks</i> simple — it’s the one that makes communication and understanding <i>feel</i> simple.

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>“A republic, if you can keep it.”</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>--Benjamin Franklin's response to Elizabeth Willing Powel's question: "Well, Doctor, what have we got, a republic or a monarchy?"</p>
</div><div id="cs_control_7611227">
<p><b><i>Monday, September 17, 1787: The Convention Today</i></b></p><p paraeid="{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{32}" paraid="1682256536">The day began with a prepared speech from Franklin (PA) who, eighty-one years old and painfully afflicted with gout and kidney stone, was unable to read it himself and delegated that task to Wilson (PA). </p>
<p paraeid="{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{46}" paraid="1054480062">While the speech was formally addressed to Washington (VA), the Convention’s president, its purpose was to convince the three delegates who had announced their refusal to sign the Constitution—Gerry (MA), Randolph (VA), and Mason (VA)—to abandon their opposition. Franklin began on a note of humility. “I confess that there are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them. For having lived long, I have experienced many instances of being obliged by better information, or fuller consideration, to change opinions even on important subjects, which I once thought right, but found to be otherwise. It is therefore that, the older I grow, the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment, and to pay more respect to the judgment of others.” </p>
<p paraeid="{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{80}" paraid="1831610571">“In these sentiments, Sir, I agree to this Constitution, with all its faults, if they are such; because I think a General Government necessary for us, and there is no form of government, but what may be a blessing to the people if well administered; and believe further, that this is likely to be well administered for a course of years, and can only end in despotism, as other forms have done before it, when the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic government.”  </p>
<p paraeid="{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{90}" paraid="1258863415">He didn’t think another Convention (which Mason and Randolph had argued for) would do any better than the first had. He admitted that the men in the room were all well-reasoned and had a diversity of opinions, making it difficult to find common ground. “From such an assembly can a perfect production be expected? It therefore astonishes me, sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does.... Thus I consent, Sir, to this Constitution, because I expect no better, and because I am not sure, that it is not the best.” </p>
<p paraeid="{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{114}" paraid="157634583">“On the whole, Sir, I cannot help expressing a wish that every member of the Convention, who may still have objections to it, would with me, on this occasion, doubt a little of his own infallibility, and to make manifest our unanimity, put his name to this instrument.” </p>
<p paraeid="{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{120}" paraid="2117331119">Franklin then moved for the form of the signing to be such: “Done in Convention by the unanimous consent of the States present, the seventeenth of September, &amp;c. In witness whereof, we have hereunto subscribed our names.” </p>
<p paraeid="{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{130}" paraid="972683271">This form had actually been thought up by Gouverneur Morris (PA), who had given it to Franklin so that Franklin’s esteem would lend it credence. The wording of the form doesn’t explicitly state that the signer is endorsing the Constitution. It only means that the signer is affirming that the states present in the Convention unanimously approved the Constitution. The idea was to get Gerry, Mason, and Randolph to sign by making their personal objections irrelevant to their signatures. </p>
<p paraeid="{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{150}" paraid="729640072">Gorham (MA) then motioned for Congress to be given the power to increase the size of the House of Representatives from one representative for every 40,000 people to one for every 30,000. (Mind that Congress would not have been required to increase the House to such a size, but just given the option to do so.) Proposals such as this one had repeatedly failed, but King (MA) and Carroll (MD) seconded him. </p>
<p paraeid="{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{164}" paraid="1319186782">Now, on this last day of the Convention, Washington (VA) spoke for the only time. While he said it was typically inappropriate for him, as president of the Convention, to offer his opinion, he felt called to support Gorham’s motion. He thought increasing the size of the House of Representatives would increase the “security of the rights and the interests of the people.” After Washington’s speech, no one spoke in opposition to the motion, and it passed unanimously. Jacob Shallus, the scribe who had the day before handwritten the engrossed copy of the Constitution, corrected the text to reflect this final amendment. </p>
<p paraeid="{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{198}" paraid="1378118405">Randolph gave a brief speech where (much like one from two days earlier) he was almost apologetic about refusing to sign the Constitution, but left open the possibility that he might support the Constitution when Virginia considered ratifying it. He stated, “Nine States [the minimum number for the Constitution to take effect] will fail to ratify the plan, and confusion must ensue.” </p>
<p paraeid="{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{216}" paraid="2102259563">G. Morris and Williamson (NC) gave speeches encouraging the holdouts to sign. Hamilton (NY) spoke similarly, with Madison (VA) summarizing him thus: “No man’s ideas were more remote from the plan than his own were known to be; but is it possible to deliberate between anarchy and convulsion on one side, and the chance of good to be expected from the plan on the other?” </p>
<p paraeid="{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{228}" paraid="1828567102">Blount (NC) stated that his signature should not be taken as a sign of his support for the Constitution but just as his affirmation that the Constitution had been unanimously approved by the states at the Convention. </p>
<p paraeid="{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{244}" paraid="18537606">Franklin gave a second speech where he personally begged Randolph to sign. Randolph said that Franklin’s proposed form for the signatures didn’t make a difference: signing the Constitution would imply that he supported it, and he didn’t. Madison writes that “He [Randolph] repeated, that, in refusing to sign the Constitution, he took a step which might be the most awful of his life; but it was dictated by his conscience, and it was not possible for him to hesitate, — much less, to change.” Randolph thought that presenting the Constitution to the American people to only accept or reject in total, without amendments, would cause all the “anarchy and civil convulsions” which the soon-to-be signers professed to want to avoid. Gerry gave a speech to the same effect. </p>
<p paraeid="{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{9}" paraid="1168694754">Charles Cotesworth Pinckney (SC) did not like the ambiguity in Franklin’s proposed form for the signatures. He supported the Constitution and intended his signature to be a sign of that support. </p>
<p paraeid="{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{19}" paraid="2066198772">Ingersoll (PA) took a middle position: his signature would not indicate his support for the Constitution, but neither would it merely be his attestation to the Convention’s unanimity. His signature would be his “recommendation” that the Convention’s final product, “all things considered, was the most eligible.” </p>
<p paraeid="{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{45}" paraid="1837245824">Franklin’s motion (related to the form of the signing) passed 10–1, with South Carolina’s vote divided on account of C.C. Pinckney and Butler wanting the form to be more emphatically supportive. </p>
<p paraeid="{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{55}" paraid="2006718381">The Convention then voted to deposit their official journals (which ended up being much less detailed than Madison’s personal notes) with Washington.  </p>
<p paraeid="{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{61}" paraid="611006880">The delegates then proceeded to sign the engrossed copy of the United States Constitution. Thirty-eight men signed thirty-nine names—Dickinson (DE) was ailing with a headache and had asked Read (DE) to sign for him two days earlier. Despite so many personal appeals, Gerry, Randolph, and Mason still refused to sign. Hamilton, as the only New Yorker present at this point, signed in a personal capacity, since New York could not be effectively represented in the Convention by only one delegate. The signatures were grouped by state, with Pennsylvania’s eight being the most. The listing of state names next to the signatures appears to be in the hand of Hamilton. Rhode Island, the only state not to send delegates to the Convention, is not listed. </p>
<p paraeid="{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{95}" paraid="328781109">After the signing, the Convention adjourned for a final time. </p>
<p paraeid="{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{101}" paraid="2133607111">The signatures did not have any legal significance. The Constitution was clear: it would only go into effect when nine of the thirteen states chose to ratify it. As hard as the past four months had been, the real challenge lay ahead, in convincing the American people to embrace the government that these men had authored. </p>
<p paraeid="{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{111}" paraid="401102845">As the last names were being signed, Franklin, in a personal aside to some other members, made an observation about the chair that Washington had been sitting in as he presided over the Convention. The chair had an emblem of half of a sun. Franklin noted that artists often have a hard time distinguishing between a rising and a setting sun in their artwork. “I have often and often, in the course of the session, and the vicissitudes of my hopes and fears as to its issue, looked at that behind the President, without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting: but now at length, I have the happiness to know, that it is a rising and not a setting sun.” </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p><span>A bill headed to the Senate floor in Utah would </span><a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/utah-ai-police-bill/"><span>require officers</span></a><span> to disclose if a </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/05/what-can-go-wrong-when-police-use-ai-write-reports"><span>police report was written by generative AI</span></a><span>. </span><span>The bill, <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/SB0180.html">S.B. 180</a>, requires a department to have a policy governing the use of AI. This policy would mandate that police reports created in whole or in part by generative AI have a disclaimer that the report contains content generated by AI and requires officers to legally certify that the report was checked for accuracy.</span></p>
<p><span>S.B. 180 is unfortunately a necessary step in the right direction when it comes to regulating the rapid spread of police using generative AI to write their narrative reports for them. EFF will continue to monitor this bill in hopes that it will be part of a larger conversation about more robust regulations. Specifically, Axon, the makers of tasers and the salespeople behind a </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/axon-acquires-fusus-ai-surveillance-retail-healthcare/"><span>shocking amount of police and surveillance tech</span></a><span>, has recently rolled out a new product, </span><a href="https://www.police1.com/police-products/police-technology/software/report-writing/revolutionizing-police-report-writing-axons-draft-one-transforms-the-tedious-into-the-effortless"><span>Draft One</span></a><span>, which uses body-worn camera audio to generate police reports. This product is spreading quickly in part because it is integrated with other </span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/12/08/police-reform-body-cameras-axon-motorola/"><span>Axon products which are already omnipresent in U.S. society</span></a><span>. <br></span></p>
<p><span>But it’s going to take more than a disclaimer to curb the potential harms of AI-generated police reports. <br></span></p>
<p><span>As we’ve previously cautioned, the public should be skeptical of AI’s ability to accurately process and distinguish between the wide range of languages, dialects, vernacular, idioms, and slang people use. As online content moderation has shown, software may have a passable ability to capture words, but it often</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/04/content-moderation-broken-let-us-count-ways"> <span>struggles with content and meaning</span></a><span>. In a tense setting such as a traffic stop, AI mistaking a metaphorical statement for a literal claim could fundamentally change the content of a police report.</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, so-called</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/how-avoid-ai-apocalypse-one-easy-step"> <span>artificial intelligence</span></a><span> taking over consequential tasks and decision-making has the power to obscure human agency. Police officers who deliberately exaggerate or lie to shape the narrative available in body camera footage now have even more of a veneer of plausible deniability with AI-generated police reports. If police were to be caught in a lie concerning what’s in the report, an officer might be able to say that they did not lie: the AI simply did not capture what was happening in the chaotic video.</span></p>
<p><span>As this technology spreads without much transparency, oversight, or guardrails, we are likely to see more cities, counties, and states push back against its use. Out of fear that AI-generated reports would complicate and compromise cases in the criminal justice system,prosecutors in King County, Washington (which includes Seattle) </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/10/prosecutors-washington-state-warn-police-dont-use-gen-ai-write-reports"><span>have instructed</span></a><span> officers not to use the technology for now. <br></span></p>
<p><span>The use of AI to write police reports is troubling in ways we are accustomed to, but also in new ways. Not only do we not yet know how widespread use of this technology will affect the criminal justice system, but because of how the product is designed, there is a chance we won’t even know if AI has been used even if we are staring directly at the police report in question. For that reason, it’s no surprise that lawmakers in Utah have introduced this bill to require some semblance of transparency. We will likely see similar regulations and restrictions in other states and local jurisdictions, and possibly even stronger ones.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Amazon recently changed the wording on their website when it comes to buying <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/storefront?storeType=browse&amp;node=154606011&amp;nodl=0&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=ter000-20&amp;linkId=929ad6761676da6a2e0bcb2ef290e121&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank">Kindle ebooks</a>.</p>
<p>As the screenshot above shows, they now have a disclaimer under the buy now button that says, “By placing your order, <strong>you’re purchasing a license to the content</strong> and you agree to the Kindle Store Terms of Use”.</p>
<p>It also says that same thing when shopping for Kindle ebooks directly from the store on Kindle ereaders and Kindle apps.</p>




<p>The funny thing is they only appear to be doing that in the US. I checked Amazon UK and Amazon CA and both show the old disclaimer that just says, “By clicking the above button, you agree to the Kindle Store Terms of Use”.</p>
<p>If you click the terms of use link you’ll find a page full of legal disclaimers indicating you’re buying a license to access Kindle content, but they don’t openly disclose it on product pages under the buy button like on the Amazon US website.</p>
<p>I read somewhere about a new law that was passed in California where companies have to “conspicuously” disclose that customers are buying a license when it comes to digital media like ebooks, so that’s likely the reason why Amazon made the change.</p>
<p>But not all ebook stores are following the same path. Kobo still just has a link to their terms of sale page when you go to checkout. Apple doesn’t say anything about licenses at all when trying to buy an ebook from them. Google doesn’t say anything about it on their ebook product pages, but they do say you’re purchasing a license before confirming the purchase, with a link to their terms of service.</p>
<p>Some people still don’t know that when buying digital content you’re buying a license to view said content, not the actual content itself. You don’t actually “own” the ebooks you purchase; you just own the rights to view them. It’s a distinction that applies to digital media since you can’t physically own it. </p>
<p>I think it’s a good idea for companies to openly disclose that fact before buying. Nobody is going to read through those ridiculous TOS pages before purchasing something.</p>

This would ripple into a career that's making my living 16 years later.</p><p>I remember downloading XAMPP and installing it to get a local MySQL and PhpMyAdmin server. A few clicks in Dreamweaver later, I somehow had a connection file that would connect to my local MySQL server. I started playing around with it and creating different forms. The MySQL query generators on Dreamweaver were so simple that you could, with a few clicks, have a full on CRM.</p><p>I ended up coding a test score reporting system for my middle school class and the school somehow trusted me and started using it. This made me possibly the most hated person in the school because parents could now see their kids scores every day and there was no more "Oh the teacher hasn't given out the scores yet." But it was good times, and I was so excited about it.</p><p>Many years later, I now run a startup and have transitioned into using Node.js but MySQL is still my bread and butter. I still remember that day when I discovered the SELECT query.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>I think about Dreamweaver once a year, last time I used it was around 2004, I guess.

I made some cool browser games with it and it sparked an interest for programming on top of designing (try making a car steer correctly in a topdown view when math and stuff is not your strongest point).</p>

                  <p>What's even more interesting is when you look at some of those tools, many of them were actually way more straightforward to use to design websites without much coding than what we have today. Just like how we had all those CRUD rapid app development tools that would build the app for you just from a database model (Access, PowerBuilder, Delphi, FoxPro...).

                  <p>I heard recently during the big government purge that a lot of the actual mechanics of that purge functioned by revoking people's Dreamweaver licenses, and that a lot of .gov websites run on Dreamweaver. Probably the US government is singlehandedly keeping Dreamweaver alive through large annual contracts for new features. I don't have any concrete sources on this, it was just Twitter gossip, but it makes a lot of sense to me—Dreamweaver provides the ability for non-technical government employees to edit the site, low system requirements for the servers, and presumably enough Enterprise features to ensure template homogeneity across an org as large as USG.</p>

Moreover, all current web browsers do a much better job at rendering web pages from HTML than do WYSIWYG editors do at turning text into HTML.</p><p>I don't think many appreciate how sophisticated web browsers are these days. Now consider that browsers such as Firefox and Chromium are open source, their code could be used to develop HTML editors.</p><p>The question I keep asking is why aren't there a plethora of HTML editors out there that harness the algorithms these browsers already use for their own development.</p><p>As you suggest, producing a good HTML editor is very hard work, if it weren't then there'd be many good editors out there but there aren't. Take wordprocessors with a 'save as HTML' option and one will find the code they produde ranges from almost unusable to abominable.</p><p>Same goes for email editors that produce HTML-formatted emails. For example, Thunderbird has about the worst HTML editor around, it's brain-dead and full of bugs, and it's been like that for decades. It's as if those at Mozilla are terrified to touch it for fear that they'll kill it altogether.</p><p>Now keep in mind that Thunderbird actually uses the Firefox engine so what's going on here? With Thunderbird is the browser code completely divorced from its email editor?</p><p>OK, you may well say that's just how is it with Thunderbird, the editor evolved separately to its rendering engine. I'll then say take a good look at BlueGriffon which is quite an excellent HTML editor based on Firefox (despite the fact that it's awkward to use and hasn't been updated in ages). How come its developer can produce good HTML whereas Thunderbird's developers don't seem to have a clue?</p><p>Also, how relevant to this discussion is the fact that BlueGriffon's development has ceased: <a href="http://bluegriffon.org/" rel="nofollow">http://bluegriffon.org/</a>. What's the actual reason for the developer ceasing development (there's likely more than he's stating on his webpage)?</p><p>Right, perhaps somewhere in all that comment lies the path to actual truth of the matter—that is, how difficult it is to actually make a decent HTML editor?</p><p>I've been on the lookout for a good open-source HTML editor for years and I've yet to see a decent discussion, analysis or exposé of the subject. Why not?</p><p>It's still impossible to sort out whether the demand for a decent HTML editor just isn't there or whether it's a too bigger project and not worth the effort.</p><p>I wish those who are truly in the know would put this matter to rest. Many of us who don't wish to delve deep into web browser/editor code would love some answers.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>It is always funny to see "professional" code or tools compared with "toys". In reality, it is precisely the "professional", "enterprise" stuff that turns out to be a giant pile of shit (which we rarely get to see from outside). There are professional businesses storing their main database in Excel, while the amateurs obsess over whether Postgres is scalable enough.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main role="main"><article><div><p>Two weeks ago at the <a href="https://x.com/trailofbits/status/1893008382677659893">DeFi Security Summit</a>, Trail of Bits’ Josselin Feist (@Montyly) was asked if we’d see a billion-dollar exploit in 2025. His response: “If it happens, it won’t be a smart contract, it’ll be an operational security issue.”</p><p>Today, that prediction was validated.</p><h2 id="the-attack">The Attack</h2><p>On February 21, 2025, cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://x.com/gauthamzzz/status/1893004593979859410">Bybit suffered the largest cryptocurrency theft</a> in history when attackers stole approximately $1.5B from their multisig cold storage wallet. At this time, it appears the attackers compromised multiple signers’ devices, manipulated what signers saw in their wallet interface, and collected the required signatures while the signers believed they were conducting routine transactions.</p><p>This hack is one of many that represent a dramatic shift in how centralized exchanges are compromised. For years, the industry has focused on hardening code and improving their technical security practices, but as the ecosystem’s secure development life cycle has matured, attackers have shifted to targeting the human and operational elements of cryptocurrency exchanges and other organizations.</p><p>These attacks reveal an escalating pattern, with each compromise building on the last:</p><ul><li><a href="https://blog.solidityscan.com/wazirx-hack-analysis-8bc8821928e9">WazirX Exchange</a> ($230M, July 2024)</li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@RadiantCapital/radiant-post-mortem-fecd6cd38081">Radiant Capital</a> ($50M, October 2024)</li><li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/bybit-says-exchange-wallet-hacked-1-5-billion-estimated-loss?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=copy">Bybit Exchange</a> ($1.5B, February 2025)</li></ul><p>In each case, the attackers didn’t exploit smart contract or application-level vulnerabilities. Instead, they compromised the computers used to manage those systems using sophisticated malware to manipulate what users saw versus what they actually signed.</p><h2 id="the-dprks-cryptocurrency-theft-infrastructure">The DPRK’s Cryptocurrency Theft Infrastructure</h2><p>These hacks are not isolated incidents. According to <a href="https://x.com/arkham/status/1893033424224411885">Arkham Intelligence</a>, famed researcher <a href="https://x.com/zachxbt">ZachXBT</a> has provided definitive proof linking this attack to North Korea, including detailed analysis of test transactions and connected wallets used ahead of the exploit. These incidents represent the maturation of sophisticated attack capabilities developed by <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-dc3-and-npa-identification-of-north-korean-cyber-actors-tracked-as-tradertraitor-responsible-for-theft-of-308-million-from-bitcoindmmcom">North Korean state-sponsored threat actors</a>, specifically groups tracked as <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-108a%20">TraderTraitor</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/intelligence-reports/east-asia-threat-actors-employ-unique-methods">Jade Sleet</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/north-korea-supply-chain">UNC4899</a>, and <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/threat-assessment-north-korean-threat-groups-2024/">Slow Pisces</a> under the DPRK’s Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB).</p><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/dprk-rgb-structure.png" alt="Figure 1: Organizational structure of DPRK cyber threat actors under the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB).

This chart shows the relationship between different threat groups and their various industry designations. Source: Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, September 2024</figcaption></figure><p>The attack chain typically begins with <a href="https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/security-alert-social-engineering-campaign-targets-technology-industry-employees/">aggressive social engineering campaigns</a> targeting multiple employees simultaneously within an organization. The RGB identifies key personnel in system administration, software development, and treasury roles, then creates detailed pretexts - often elaborate job recruitment schemes - customized to each target’s background and interests. These aren’t mass phishing campaigns; they’re meticulously crafted approaches designed to compromise specific individuals with access to critical systems.</p><p>What makes these attacks particularly concerning is their repeatability. The RGB has built a sophisticated cross-platform toolkit that can:</p><ul><li>Operate seamlessly across Windows, MacOS, and various wallet interfaces</li><li>Show minimal signs of compromise while maintaining persistence</li><li>Function as backdoors to execute arbitrary commands</li><li>Download and execute additional malicious payloads</li><li>Manipulate what users see in their interfaces</li></ul><p><a href="https://github.com/tayvano/lazarus-bluenoroff-research">Each successful compromise</a> has allowed the RGB to refine their tools and techniques. They’re not starting from scratch with each target - they’re executing a tested playbook that’s specifically engineered to defeat standard cryptocurrency security controls when those controls are used in isolation.</p><p>Organizations below a certain security threshold are now at serious risk. Without comprehensive security controls including:</p><ul><li>Air-gapped signing systems</li><li>Multiple layers of transaction verification</li><li>Endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems like CrowdStrike or SentinelOne</li><li>Regular security training and war games</li></ul><p>They are likely to face an adversary that has already built and tested the exact tools needed to defeat their existing protections.</p><h2 id="the-new-reality-of-cryptocurrency-security">The New Reality of Cryptocurrency Security</h2><p>This attack highlights a fundamental truth: no single security control, no matter how robust, can protect against sophisticated attackers targeting operational security. While secure code remains crucial, it must be part of a comprehensive security strategy.</p><p>Organizations must adopt new processes and controls that operate under the assumption that their infrastructure will eventually face compromise:</p><ol><li><strong>Infrastructure Segmentation:</strong> Critical operations like transaction signing require both physical and logical separation from day-to-day business operations. This isolation ensures that a breach of corporate systems cannot directly impact signing infrastructure. Critical operations should use dedicated hardware, separate networks, and strictly controlled access protocols.</li><li><strong>Defense-in-Depth:</strong> Security controls must work in concert - hardware wallets, multi-signature schemes, and transaction verification tools each provide important protections, but true security emerges from their coordinated operation. Organizations need multiple, overlapping controls that can detect and prevent sophisticated attacks.</li><li><strong>Organizational Preparedness:</strong> Technical controls must be supported by comprehensive security programs that include:<ul><li>Thorough threat modeling incorporating both technical and operational risks</li><li>Regular third-party security assessments of infrastructure and procedures</li><li>Well-documented and frequently tested incident response plans</li><li>Ongoing security awareness training tailored to specific roles</li><li>War games and attack simulations that test both systems and personnel</li></ul></li></ol><p>These principles aren’t new - they represent hard-won lessons from years of security incidents in both traditional finance and cryptocurrency. Trail of Bits has consistently advocated for this comprehensive approach to security, providing concrete guidance through several key publications:</p><ul><li><a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/11/27/10-rules-for-the-secure-use-of-cryptocurrency-hardware-wallets/">10 Rules for the Secure Use of Cryptocurrency Hardware Wallets</a> (2018) - Our foundational guidance on hardware wallet security that specifically warned about the risks of hardware wallet compromise and the need for high-assurance workstations - precisely the type of issues exploited in today’s attack.</li><li><a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/06/24/managing-risk-in-blockchain-deployments/">Managing Operational Risk in Blockchain Deployments</a> (2022) - A comprehensive framework highlighting the risks of centralized infrastructure and providing concrete guidance for implementing defense-in-depth approaches to protect high-value cryptocurrency operations.</li><li><a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/08/14/can-you-pass-the-rekt-test/">The Rekt Test - our simple framework for assessing basic security controls</a> (2023) - Our simple but thorough framework for assessing basic security controls, emphasizing the critical importance of proper key management, infrastructure separation, and incident response planning - all factors that proved critical in today’s incident.</li><li><a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/02/05/preventing-account-takeover-on-centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges-in-2025/">Preventing Account Takeovers in Cryptocurrency Exchanges</a> (2025) - A detailed analysis of attack patterns targeting cryptocurrency exchanges that predicted the industry’s pivot from technical exploits toward operational attacks.</li></ul><p>These publications show a clear pattern that’s echoed by recent attacks: sophisticated attackers are increasingly targeting operational security vulnerabilities rather than technical flaws.</p><p>The cryptocurrency industry’s resistance to implementing traditional corporate security controls, combined with the high value of potential targets and this group’s sophisticated capabilities, suggests these attacks are likely to continue unless significant changes are made to how cryptocurrency companies approach operational security.</p><h2 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h2><p>The Bybit hack marks a new era in cryptocurrency security. Industry participants need to recognize the evolving threat landscape and invest additional resources in improving their operational security. No one understands this reality better than the security researchers who have been tracking these attacks.</p><p>Tay <a href="https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1847877033701122395">@tayvano_</a>, a renowned security researcher known for exposing on-chain thefts, dissecting DPRK crypto hacks, and fiercely advocating for better blockchain security practices, summarized the current reality bluntly:</p><blockquote><p>For all these reasons and more, it’s my opinion that once they get on your device, you’re fucked. The end.
If your keys are hot or in AWS, they fuck you immediately.
If they aren’t, they work slightly harder to fuck you.
But no matter what, you’re going to get fucked.</p></blockquote><p>Organizations must protect themselves through a comprehensive defense strategy combining isolation, verification, detection, and robust operational security controls. However, the time for basic security measures has passed. Organizations holding significant cryptocurrency assets must take immediate action:</p><ul><li>Conduct a thorough operational risk assessment using established frameworks like our “<a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/06/24/managing-risk-in-blockchain-deployments/">Managing Operational Risk in Blockchain Deployments</a>”</li><li>Implement dedicated, air-gapped signing infrastructure</li><li>Engage with security teams experienced in defending against sophisticated state actors</li><li>Build and regularly test incident response plans</li></ul><p>The next billion-dollar hack isn’t a matter of if, but when. The only question is: will your organization be ready?</p></div></article></main></div></div>]]></description>

	<p>30 years ago Origin released Ultima VII - The Black Gate and many still
	hold this game in a very high regard. We certainly do!<br>
	Instead of waiting another decade this is the perfect opportunity to release
	our next version. Because of the measures we took to eliminate weird crashes
	it was important to make a new release available.<br>
	By default we will now play the extended intro of Serpent Isle, that we restored
	from an old recording of it. It was cut and slimmed down for the release of
	Ultima VII's Part 2 to conserve precious floppy disk space. A shout out to
	Denis Loubet for creating this masterpiece.<br>
	Two important things were always missing from Exult in regards to the Black
	Gate:<br>
	The sound effects in the intro and the congratulations screen! Both are now
	present!<br>
	Currently we are in the process of merging Ken Cecka's fork of Exult for
	<b>Android</b> (*). While this is not yet finished, Ken created a 1.8 version
	based on our release code.<br>

	You can find the Android, Windows and macOS releases on our
	<a href="https://exult.sourceforge.io/download.php">download page</a> (**).<br>
	Please play with it and tell us of any problem you encounter using the

	<a href="https://github.com/exult/exult/issues">bug tracker</a>.</p>

	<p>A brief list of the most important changes in Exult since v1.6:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Windows builds are by default 64bit</li>
	<li>Exult Studio modernized by porting it to GTK+ 3 (thanks Dragon Baroque)</li>
	<li>Exult Studio now offered as a download for macOS</li>
	<li>Exult shows the proper ending screen for BG (you have beaten Ultima VII in nn days...)</li>
	<li>Sound effects in the BG intro were missing</li>
	<li>Extended intro for SI implemented</li>
	<li>More crashes eliminated caused by cached out objects</li>
	<li>"Gumps pause game" no longer delays usecode events</li>
	<li>Smooth virtual joystick movement on iOS</li>
	<li>iOS shows the mouse cursor when a real mouse device is used</li>
	<li>Screenshots will now be saved in the PNG format</li>
	<li>Status bars can now also be vertical on both sides of the screen</li>
	<li>Updated Windows installer to download and install the audio packs and our mods</li>
	<li>Our options have been reordered</li>
	</ul>

	<p>But we do have known issues:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Antimagic rain caused by the cube generator is still not dissipating as fast as it should</li>
	<li>Exult does not return to the game menu after beating the game (instead it quits)</li>
	<li>Some schedules need more detailed love</li>
	<li>Several bugs that need more in-depth looking at but no plot-stopping bugs</li>
	</ul>
	<p>(*) Follow Ken's fork at his

	<td><p><b><u>Exult 1.6 has been released to celebrate Ultima VII's 28th birthday!</u></b><br></p>
	<p>Almost ten years after the version 1.4.9rc1, 16 years after the last stable version (v1.2) and
	28 years after the official release of Ultima VII - The Black Gate (16 April 1992), we are finally
	ready to release a new version. With many developers busy with their real life and most having moved on,
	it took us this long. We have been busy squashing more of the inexplicable crashes but these changes
	will force us to stop supporting some ancient operating systems.<br>
	That's why we decided to release one last version of Exult, Exult Studio and Exult's tools for the old OS'
	before moving on with development. For really old Windows operating systems (95/98/ME/NT/2000) we prepared
	a legacy download.<br>
	So please grab the new version available on our <a href="https://exult.sourceforge.io/download.php">download page</a>.<br>
	Please play with it and tell us of any problem you encounter using the
	<a href="https://exult.sourceforge.io/forum/index.php">forum</a> or

	<p>A brief list of the most important changes in Exult since v1.4.9rc1:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Shortcut bar with important shortcuts right on top of the screen (thanks Litchie)</li>
	<li>Switch to SDL2 - important for up to date OS'</li>
	<li>NxBR and HQ3x/HQ4x scalers</li>
	<li>Option to drop stacks of items without confirmation</li>
	<li>Some more combat options to make charmed combat more difficult</li>
	<li>Schedules got a work-over and are more closer to the original but not yet perfect</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true" aria-labelledby="file-name-id-wide file-name-id-mobile"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><strong>FFmpeg Assembly Language Lesson One</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Welcome to the FFmpeg School of Assembly Language. You have taken the first step on the most interesting, challenging, and rewarding journey in programming. These lessons will give you a grounding in the way assembly language is written in FFmpeg and open your eyes to what's actually going on in your computer..</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Required Knowledge</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Knowledge of C, in particular pointers. If you don't know C, work through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language" rel="nofollow">The C Programming Language</a> book</li>
<li>High School Mathematics (scalar vs vector, addition, multiplication etc)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>What is assembly language?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Assembly language is a programming language where you write code that directly corresponds to the instructions a CPU processes. Human readable assembly language is, as the name suggests, <em>assembled</em> into binary data, known as <em>machine code</em>, that the CPU can understand. You might see assembly language code referred to as “assembly” or “asm” for short.</p>
<p dir="auto">The vast majority of assembly code in FFmpeg is what's known as <em>SIMD, Single Instruction Multiple Data</em>. SIMD is sometimes referred to as vector programming. This means that a particular instruction operates on multiple elements of data at the same time. Most programming languages operate on one data element at a time, known as scalar programming.</p>
<p dir="auto">As you might have guessed, SIMD lends itself well to processing images, video, and audio which have lots of data ordered sequentially in memory. There are specialist instructions available in the CPU to help us process sequential data.</p>
<p dir="auto">In FFmpeg, you'll see the terms “assembly function”, “SIMD”, and “vector(ise)” used interchangeably. They all refer to the same thing: Writing a function in assembly language by hand to process multiple elements of data in one go. Some projects may also refer to these as “assembly kernels”.</p>
<p dir="auto">All of this might sound complicated, but it's important to remember that in FFmpeg, high schoolers have written assembly code. As with everything, learning is 50% jargon and 50% actual learning.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Why do we write in assembly language?</strong><br>
To make multimedia processing fast. It’s very common to get a 10x or more speed improvement from writing assembly code, which is especially important when wanting to play videos in real time without stuttering. It also saves energy and extends battery life. It’s worth pointing out that video encode and decode functions are some of the most heavily used functions on earth, both by end-users and by big companies in their datacentres. So even a small improvement adds up quickly.</p>
<p dir="auto">You’ll often see, online, people use <em>intrinsics,</em> which are C-like functions that map to assembly instructions to allow for faster development. In FFmpeg we don’t use intrinsics but instead write assembly code by hand. This is an area of controversy, but intrinsics are typically around 10-15% slower than hand-written assembly (intrinsics supporters would disagree), depending on the compiler. For FFmpeg, every bit of extra performance helps, which is why we write in assembly code directly. There’s also an argument that intrinsics are difficult to read owing to their use of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation" rel="nofollow">Hungarian Notation</a>”.</p>
<p dir="auto">You may also see <em>inline assembly</em> (i.e. not using intrinsics) remaining in a few places in FFmpeg for historical reasons, or in projects like the Linux Kernel because of very specific use cases there. This is where assembly code is not in a separate file, but written inline with C code. The prevailing opinion in projects like FFmpeg is that this code is hard to read, not widely supported by compilers and unmaintainable.</p>
<p dir="auto">Lastly, you’ll see a lot of self-proclaimed experts online saying none of this is necessary and the compiler can do all of this “vectorisation” for you. At least for the purpose of learning, ignore them: recent tests in e.g. <a href="https://www.videolan.org/projects/dav1d.html" rel="nofollow">the dav1d project</a> showed around a 2x speedup from this automatic vectorisation, while the hand-written versions could reach 8x.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Flavours of assembly language</strong><br>
These lessons will focus on x86 64-bit assembly language. This is also known as amd64, although it still works on Intel CPUs. There are other types of assembly for other CPUs like ARM and RISC-V and potentially in the future these lessons will be extended to cover those.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are two flavours of x86 assembly syntax that you’ll see online: AT&amp;T and Intel. AT&amp;T Syntax is older and harder to read compared to Intel syntax. So we will use Intel syntax.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Supporting materials</strong><br>
You might be surprised to hear that books or online resources like Stack Overflow are not particularly helpful as references. This is in part because of our choice to use handwritten assembly with Intel syntax. But also because a lot of online resources are focused on operating system programming or hardware programming, usually using non-SIMD code. FFmpeg assembly is particularly focused on high performance image processing, and as you’ll see it’s a particularly unique approach to assembly programming. That said, it’s easy to understand other assembly use-cases once you’ve completed these lessons</p>
<p dir="auto">Many books go into a lot of computer architecture details before teaching assembly. This is fine if that’s what you want to learn, but from our standpoint, it’s like studying engines before learning to drive a car.</p>
<p dir="auto">That said, the diagrams in the later parts of “The Art of 64-bit assembly” book showing SIMD instructions and their behaviour in a visual form are helpful: <a href="https://artofasm.randallhyde.com/" rel="nofollow">https://artofasm.randallhyde.com/</a></p>
<p dir="auto">A discord server is available to answer questions:<br>
<a href="https://discord.com/invite/Ks5MhUhqfB" rel="nofollow">https://discord.com/invite/Ks5MhUhqfB</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Registers</strong><br>
Registers are areas in the CPU where data can be processed. CPUs don’t operate on memory directly, but instead data is loaded into registers, processed, and written back to memory. In assembly language, generally, you cannot directly copy data from one memory location to another without first passing that data through a register.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>General Purpose Registers</strong><br>
The first type of register is what is known as a General Purpose Register (GPR). GPRs are referred to as general purpose because they can contain either data, in this case up to a 64-bit value, or a memory address (a pointer). A value in a GPR can be processed through operations like addition, multiplication, shifting, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">In most assembly books, there are whole chapters dedicated to the subtleties of GPRs, the historical background etc. This is because GPRs are important when it comes to operating system programming, reverse engineering, etc. In the assembly code written in FFmpeg, GPRs are more like scaffolding and most of the time their complexities are not needed and abstracted away.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Vector registers</strong><br>
Vector (SIMD) registers, as the name suggests, contain multiple data elements. There are various types of vector registers:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>mm registers - MMX registers, 64-bit sized, historic and not used much any more</li>
<li>xmm registers - XMM registers, 128-bit sized, widely available</li>
<li>ymm registers - YMM registers, 256-bit sized, some complications when using these</li>
<li>zmm registers - ZMM registers, 512-bit sized, limited availability</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Most calculations in video compression and decompression are integer-based so we’ll stick to that. Here’s an example of 16 bytes in an xmm register:</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
<th>c</th>
<th>d</th>
<th>e</th>
<th>f</th>
<th>g</th>
<th>h</th>
<th>i</th>
<th>j</th>
<th>k</th>
<th>l</th>
<th>m</th>
<th>n</th>
<th>o</th>
<th>p</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">But it could be eight words (16-bit integers)</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
<th>c</th>
<th>d</th>
<th>e</th>
<th>f</th>
<th>g</th>
<th>h</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">Or four double words (32-bit integers)</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
<th>c</th>
<th>d</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">Or two quadwords (64-bit integers):</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">To recap:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>b</strong>ytes - 8-bit data</li>
<li><strong>w</strong>ords - 16-bit data</li>
<li><strong>d</strong>oublewords - 32-bit data</li>
<li><strong>q</strong>uadwords - 64-bit data</li>
<li><strong>d</strong>ouble <strong>q</strong>uadwords - 128-bit data</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The bold characters will be important later.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>x86inc.asm include</strong><br>
You’ll see in many examples we include the file x86inc.asm. X86inc.asm is a lightweight abstraction layer used in FFmpeg, x264, and dav1d to make an assembly programmer's life easier. It helps in many ways, but to begin with, one of the useful things it does is it labels GPRs, r0, r1, r2. This means you don’t have to remember any register names. As mentioned before, GPRs are generally just scaffolding so this makes life a lot easier.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A simple scalar asm snippet</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Let’s look at a simple (and very much artificial) snippet of scalar asm (assembly code that operates on individual data items, one at a time, within each instruction) to see what’s going on:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="mov  r0q, 3  
inc  r0q  
dec  r0q  
imul r0q, 5"><pre><span>mov</span><span>  r0q</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>  </span>
<span>inc</span><span>  r0q  </span>
<span>dec</span><span>  r0q  </span>
<span>imul</span><span> r0q</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>5</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In the first line, the <em>immediate value</em> 3 (a value stored directly in the assembly code itself as opposed to a value fetched from memory) is being stored into register r0 as a quadword. Note that in Intel syntax, the source operand (the value or location providing the data, located on the right) is transferred to the destination operand (the location receiving the data, located on the left), much like the behavior of memcpy. You can also read it as “r0q = 3”, since the order is the same. The “q” suffix of r0 designates the register as being used as a quadword. inc increments the value so that r0q contains 4, dec decrements the value back to 3. imul multiplies the value by 5. So at the end, r0q contains 15.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that the human readable instructions such as mov and inc, which are assembled into machine code by the assembler, are known as <em>mnemonics</em>. You may see online and in books mnemonics represented with capital letters like MOV and INC but these are the same as the lower case versions. In FFmpeg, we use lower case mnemonics and keep upper case reserved for macros.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Understanding a basic vector function</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Here’s our first SIMD function:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="%include &quot;x86inc.asm&quot;

SECTION .text

;static void add_values(const uint8_t *src, const uint8_t *src2)  
INIT_XMM sse2  
cglobal add_values, 2, 2, 2, src, src2   
    movu  m0, [srcq]  
    movu  m1, [src2q]

    paddb m0, m1

    movu  [srcq], m0

    RET"><pre><span>%include</span> <span>"x86inc.asm"</span>

<span>SECTION</span><span> .text</span>

<span>;static void add_values(const uint8_t *src, const uint8_t *src2)  </span>
<span>INIT_XMM sse2  </span>
<span>c</span><span>global</span> <span>add_values</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> src</span><span>,</span><span> src2   </span>
<span>    movu  m0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>srcq</span><span>]</span><span>  </span>
<span>    movu  m1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>src2q</span><span>]</span>

<span>    </span><span>paddb</span><span> m0</span><span>,</span><span> m1</span>

<span>    movu  </span><span>[</span><span>srcq</span><span>],</span><span> m0</span>

<span>    </span><span>RET</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Let’s go through it line by line:</p>

<p dir="auto">This is a “header” developed in the x264, FFmpeg, and dav1d communities to provide helpers, predefined names and macros (such as cglobal below) to simplify writing assembly.</p>

<p dir="auto">This denotes the section where the code you want to execute is placed. This is in contrast to the .data section, where you can put constant data.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=";static void add_values(const uint8_t *src, const uint8_t *src2);  
INIT_XMM sse2"><pre><span>;static void add_values(const uint8_t *src, const uint8_t *src2);  </span>
<span>INIT_XMM sse2</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The first line is a comment (the semi-colon “;” in asm is like “//” in C) showing what the function argument looks like in C. The second line shows how we are initialising the function to use XMM registers, using the sse2 instruction set. This is because paddb is an sse2 instruction. We’ll cover sse2 in more detail in the next lesson.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cglobal add_values, 2, 2, 2, src, src2"><pre><span>c</span><span>global</span> <span>add_values</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> src</span><span>,</span><span> src2</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This is an important line as it defines a C function called “add_values”.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let’s go through each item one at a time:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The next parameter shows it has two function arguments.</li>
<li>The parameter after that shows that we’ll use two GPRs for the arguments. In some cases we might want to use more GPRs so we have to tell x86util we need more.</li>
<li>The parameter after that tells x86util how many XMM registers we are going to use.</li>
<li>The following two parameters are labels for the function arguments.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">It’s worth noting that older code may not have labels for the function arguments but instead address GPRs directly using r0, r1 etc.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    movu  m0, [srcq]  
    movu  m1, [src2q]"><pre><span>    movu  m0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>srcq</span><span>]</span><span>  </span>
<span>    movu  m1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>src2q</span><span>]</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">movu is shorthand for movdqu (move double quad unaligned). Alignment will be covered in another lesson but for now movu can be treated as a 128-bit move from [srcq]. In the case of mov, the brackets mean that the address in [srcq] is being dereferenced, the equivalent of *<em>src in C.</em> This is what’s known as a load. Note that the “q” suffix refers to the size of the pointer *(*i.e in C it represents *sizeof(*src) == 8 on 64-bit systems, and x86asm is smart enough to use 32-bit on 32-bit systems) but the underlying load is 128-bit.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that we don’t refer to vector registers by their full name, in this case xmm0,but as m0, an abstracted form. In future lessons you’ll see how this means you can write code once and have it work on multiple SIMD register sizes.</p>

<p dir="auto">paddb (read this in your head as <em>p-add-b</em>) is adding each byte in each register as shown below. The “p” prefix stands for “packed” and is used to identify vector instructions vs scalar instructions. The “b” suffix shows that this is bytewise addition (addition of bytes).</p>

<p dir="auto">This is what’s known as a store. The data is written back to the address in the srcq pointer.</p>

<p dir="auto">This is a macro to denote the function returns. Virtually all assembly functions in FFmpeg modify the data in the arguments as opposed to returning a value.</p>
<p dir="auto">As you’ll see in the assignment, we create function pointers to assembly functions and use them where available.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Remember cassettes? If you’re old enough, you might remember dropping one into a player, only to have it screech at you when you pressed “play”. We’ve fixed that problem. But why would we bother?</p>

<p>Before the iPod came along, people recorded their favourite tunes straight from the radio. Some of us made home recordings with our sibling and grandparents – precious childhood snippets. </p>

<p>And a few of us even have recordings from that time we travelled to a village in Vanuatu, some 40 years ago, and heard the locals performing in a language that no longer exists.</p>

<p>In the field of linguistics, such recordings are beyond priceless – yet often out of reach, due to the degradation of old cassettes over time. With a new tool, we are able to repair those tapes, and in doing so can recover the stories, songs and memories they hold. </p>

<h2>A digital humanities telescope</h2>

<p>Our digital archive, <a href="https://paradisec.org.au/">PARADISEC</a> (Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures) contains thousands of hours of audio – mainly from musicological or linguistic fieldwork. This audio represents some 1,360 languages, with a major focus on languages of the Pacific and Papua New Guinea. </p>

<p>The PARADISEC research project was started in 2003 as a collaboration between the universities of Melbourne and Sydney, and the Australian National University. </p>

<p>Like a humanities telescope, PARADISEC allows us to learn more about the language diversity around us, as we explained in a 2016 <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-race-to-digitise-language-records-of-the-pacific-region-before-it-is-too-late-55568#comment_988678">Conversation article</a>.</p>

<h2>Lubing the screech</h2>

<p>While many of the tapes we get are in good condition and can be readily played and digitised, others need special care, and the removal of mould and dirt.</p>

<p>We work with colleagues at agencies such as the Solomon Islands National Museum, for whom we recently repaired a set of cassettes that were previously unplayable and just screeched. We’ll be taking those cassettes, now repaired and digitised, back to Honiara in February and expect to pick up more for further treatment. </p>

<p>Screeching happens when a tape is dried out and can’t move through the mechanism easily. The screeching covers the audio signal we want to capture. </p>

<p>In 2019, my colleague Sam King built (with the help of his colleague Doug Smith) a cassette-lubricating machine while working at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. This machine – likely the first of its kind in Australia – allowed us to play many previously unplayable tapes.</p>

<p>Last year, Sam built two versions of an updated machine called the LM-3032 Tape Restorator for PARADISEC, improving on the previous model. Between hand building some parts, 3D printing others and writing code for the controllers, it took him more than a year.</p>

<h2>Preserving culture and heritage</h2>

<p>The LM-3032 Tape Restorator works by applying cyclomethicone (a silicone-based solvent used in cosmetics) to the length of a tape. This leaves behind an extremely thin film of lubrication that allows smoother playback, making digitisation possible. See more details <a href="https://www.paradisec.org.au/blog/2025/01/the-tape-restorator/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Tests have shown this process has no negative long-term effects on the tape. In fact, tapes treated with this method five years ago still play without issues. </p>

<p>This technological wizardry allows us to salvage precious analogue recordings before <a href="https://www.nfsa.gov.au/corporate-information/publications/deadline-2025">it’s too late</a>. For many languages, these may be the only known recordings – stored on a single cassette, in a single location, and virtually inaccessible. Some of the primary research records digitised by PARADISEC have survived long periods of neglect in offices, garages and attics.</p>

<p>The audio below is from a tape that was kept at Fitzroy Crossing in the Kimberley for 40 years. It features beautiful singing in the local Walmajarri language, with guitar accompaniment. The first seven seconds are from the untreated tape, while the rest is from the treated version.</p>

      </p>

<p>Our experience has shown community members truly value finding records in their own languages, and we’re committed to making this process easier for them.</p>

<p>Here’s one testimonial from E’ava Geita, Papua New Guinea’s current acting Solicitor General. In 2015, Geita was overjoyed to hear digitised records capturing PNG’s <a href="https://catalog.paradisec.org.au/collections/search?language_code=kqi">Koita language</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If only you witnessed and captured the reaction in me going through the recordings at home! It is quite an amazing experience! From feeling of awe to emotion to deep excitement! The feeling of knowing that your language has been documented or recorded in a structured way, kept safely somewhere in the world, hearing it spoken 50–60 years ago and by some people you haven’t seen but whose names you only hear in history is quite incredible. It is most heartwarming to know that it is possible to sustain the life of my language. Thank you once again for the opportunity to listen to the records. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered video sharing platform Rumble to be taken offline in the Latin American country within 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his decision, Moraes said Rumble has not complied with court orders, such as appointing a legal representative for <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/brazil/t-19068233">Brazil</a>. Moraes also said the video platform must pay pending legal fines.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Moraes: Rumble must take down platform of Allan Dos Santos</h2>

<p>Rumble has "repeatedly, consciously and willingly not complied, and is trying not to submit to Brazil's legal order and judiciary," Moraes asserted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moraes&nbsp;also said Rumble refused to comply with a court order that mandated the platform take down the channel of Brazilian conservative journalist Allan dos Santos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="69964452" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/69964452_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes in Brasilia, Brazil on August 14, 2024" src="https://static.dw.com/image/69964452_$%7BformatId%7D.jpg"><figcaption>Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes is loathed by the far-right and former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro [FILE: August 14, 2024]<small>Image: Eraldo Peres/AP/picture alliance </small></figcaption></figure>

<p>Dos Santos, who is based in the southern US state of Florida,&nbsp;is a staunch supporter of former <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/jair-bolsonaro/t-48797570">Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro</a>. He is a fugitive in Brazil for his role in spreading disinformation, with Moraes seeking the extradition of Dos Santos.&nbsp;</p><h2>Rumble accuses&nbsp;Moraes of 'unprecedented censorship'</h2>

<p>In response, Rumble said the platform is experiencing "unprecedented censorship in Brazil." The company, which has headquarters in both Canada and Florida, said Morae's orders are "in response to our refusal to censor political dissidents residing in the United States."</p>

<p>Rumble is responsible for the back-services for <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/donald-trump/t-19434433">US President Donald Trump's</a> Truth Social media site.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Rumble and the Trump Media &amp; Technology Group&nbsp;sued Moraes, accusing him of infringing on the free speech protections of the First Amendment of the US constitution. The lawsuit referenced Dos Santos as Political Dissident A.</p>

<p>"Allowing Justice Moraes to muzzle a vocal user on an American digital outlet would jeopardize our country's bedrock commitment to open and robust debate," that lawsuit said. "Neither extraterritorial dictates nor judicial overreach from abroad can override the freedoms protected by the US Constitution and law."</p>

<p>A venture capital company co-founded by current Vice President JD Vance invested in Rumble in 2021. JD Vance has expressed concerns about free speech in countries <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/vance-criticizes-germanys-free-speech-laws-at-cpac-summit/a-71706133">outside of the US such as Germany</a>, and said these concerns would drive foreign policy under the <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/trump-administration-sparks-fears-of-censorship-to-us-arts-scene/a-71675389">Trump administration</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Governments vs X: What does it mean for us?

<p>The crackdown on Rumble in Brazil comes after Moraes ordered the suspension of <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/elon-musk/t-63587027">Elon Musk's</a> <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/x-formerly-twitter/t-38240794">X</a>, also for failing to appoint a legal representative in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Musk was angered by the order, the company eventually complied with Moraes' demands around a month later, with X being brought back online in Brazil.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moraes is a powerful figure in Brazilian politics. Supporters believe his rulings are necessary to protect Brazil's relatively young democracy, whereas detractors believe he is engaged in judicial overreach.&nbsp;</p>

The only thing keeping me inside the Google ecosystem is my university and I hate that since they are paying for it anyway, so it makes absolutely no sense if not for it being the lazy way of doing things. Why choose to be lazy when it's clearly doing more harm than good?
I managed to install android with microg and it has worked flawlessly for 4 years now. There are many options to do this of course, but they all require a lot of time to set up. Still a better alternative than being locked up under Google.</p>

But somehow I have feeling that even if it would be reduced to 0%, it wouldn't make a big difference Cars of US brands are generally terrible, not sure how they fulfill EU emission standards, have poor MPG which with EU gas prices are very expensive in maintenance.
Maybe Japanese, Korean or EU brands manufactured US could do better.</p>

                  <p>LLMs are something everybody can reproduce with enough money, as shown by Musk itself recently: in one year they have Grok3 which is a SOTA model, without having particular talents or innovations, just following the recipe everybody else is using (and this is why you see new companies competing with established companies: all are training transformers with a lot of tokens, basically). So Europe can have their LLMs as well: the important thing is to relax this stupid AI act, that the biggest countries in Europe didn't want (Germany, France, Italy) but that somewhat passed (and it is not impossible that there are external influences and corruptions). About the search engine: Google at this point is almost a joke, to the point it is simpler to redo it right than trying to fix it from the internal. Remember that a lot of key technologies are created by europeans: from Python to Linux, to MySQL and so on. Europe has all the potential needed <i>if the right choices are made</i> to do everything needed.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="articleBody"><section><p>TALLAHASSEE — While Florida insurers claimed to be losing money in the wake of hurricanes Irma and Michael, their parent companies and affiliates were making billions of dollars, according to a study obtained by the Times/Herald.</p><p>The start of the state’s insurance market meltdown came on the heels of those two storms between 2017 and 2019, as companies justified big rate increases to cover their losses.</p><p>But those financial hardships don’t tell the full story, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25540452-affiliated-fee-analysis-executive-summary/" target="_blank">according to the 2022 study</a> that has never been made public and was released to the Times/Herald after a two-year wait for public records.</p><p>The report, the most in-depth dive into the byzantine finances of Florida’s homeowners insurance market, reveals that as the industry was ailing and companies were losing money, executives distributed $680 million in dividends to shareholders while diverting billions more to affiliate companies.</p><p>Executives with most Florida-based insurers were removing so much money from<b> </b>their companies that they violated state regulations, the study’s author concluded.</p><p>The result left some insurers financially weaker — and potentially unable to pay claims — heading into the depths of the state’s insurance crisis.</p><p>State lawmakers never saw the report.</p><p>The state’s then-insurance commissioner and Gov. Ron DeSantis focused on legal reforms making it harder to sue insurers.</p><p>And regulators have not repeated the study since, despite <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25540452-affiliated-fee-analysis-executive-summary/" target="_blank">a recommendation from the report’s author</a>.</p><p>The findings are a “smoking gun” that confirms what <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/12/11/property-insurance-compensation-executives-legislature-special-session/" target="_blank">has long been suspected in Florida’s market</a>, said Doug Quinn, executive director of the watchdog American Policyholder Association.</p><p>“These companies are crying poverty in order to raise premiums or justify insolvency: ‘It’s litigation, it’s fraud,‘” Quinn said. “This is money shifting from their left pocket to the right, and crying poverty while their right pocket bulges.”</p><p>State regulators say the insurance market is different today. In recent years, Florida Insurance Commissioner Mike Yaworsky <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2023/04/28/florida-legislature-insurance-insolvencies-premiums-profits/" target="_blank">has pushed for more oversight of affiliate companies</a>. This year, he’s asking lawmakers to change how insurers pay affiliates.</p><p>While the report is an incomplete picture of insurers' money,<b> </b>Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation said in a statement, the study affirms that the reforms the office wants are warranted.</p><p>But<b> </b>Paul Handerhan, founder of the trade group Federal Association for Insurance Reform, whose members include insurance companies,<b> </b>disputed the idea that executives were deliberately moving money around.</p><p>“This notion that they’re fleecing their policyholders and offshoring the money to their affiliates is just not happening,” Handerhan said. “None of these guys did this as a strategy.”</p><p>During debates in the Legislature over how best to respond to the insurance crisis between 2018 and 2023, some lawmakers asked what role affiliate companies played.</p><p>Rep. Hillary Cassel, R-Dania Beach, said lawmakers and observers had a lack of data about affiliates, known in the industry as “managing general agents,” when they were voting on legislation.</p><p>“All of us informed on the issues knew (managing general agents) were a problem,” said Cassel, a former lawyer for insurance companies who now sues them.</p><p>The Office of Insurance Regulation said in a statement that the study was not given to lawmakers because it was “not a formal examination report.”<b> </b>It was produced months before lawmakers met in emergency legislative sessions in 2022 and left in a “draft” status.</p><p>“Our office does not release every internal analysis of companies to the Legislature,” the office said.</p><p>The Times/Herald requested the report in November 2022, but the office did not turn over the executive summary until December 2024.</p><p>The affiliate structure is nothing new in Florida.</p><p>Profits of insurance companies are limited by regulators to about 4.5% — hardly enticing to investors, considering the risk of hurricanes.</p><p>However, insurance executives in Florida have used financial workarounds to reward investors and themselves.</p><p>While the profits and executive compensation of the insurance company are capped, the profits of affiliate and parent companies are not.</p><p>So executives create sister companies that charge the insurance company for basic services, such as claims handling, underwriting, accounting and issuing policies. (Large national insurers typically handle all of those services internally.)</p><p>Arrangements between insurance companies and affiliates must be approved by the state, and regulations say they must be “fair and reasonable,” which isn’t defined in state law.</p><p>Company structures can appear like a spiderweb of entities. When FedNat Insurance went insolvent in 2022, it was <a href="https://myfloridacfo.com/docs-sf/rehabilitation-and-liquidation-libraries/rehab-documents/insolvency-reports/pc/fednat-insurance-company---2025.pdf?sfvrsn=61714f67_2" target="_blank">one of nine corporations under a parent company</a>.</p><p>When Southern Fidelity Insurance dissolved that year, it was <a href="https://myfloridacfo.com/docs-sf/rehabilitation-and-liquidation-libraries/rehab-documents/insolvency-reports/pc/southern-fidelity-insurance-company---2024.pdf?sfvrsn=52789be4_1" target="_blank">one of six companies under the same umbrella</a>, and its holdings included a hunting lodge maintained at a cost of $485,000 per year. State officials were investigating whether the company “took active measures to conceal these costs” from regulators, according to an October insolvency report.</p><p>Most insurers in Florida have similar arrangements, which are enormously lucrative for some executives who were the <a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/2081759374?sourcetype=Trade%20Journals" target="_blank">highest-paid in the nation in some years</a>.</p><p>But this type of setup can be easily abused and requires greater regulatory scrutiny, according to the <a href="https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/publications-fah.pdf" target="_blank">National Association of Insurance Commissioners</a>.</p><p>That’s because the owner of the insurance company also owns the affiliates, creating an incentive for executives to overcharge the insurance company for services.</p><p>Such abuses have been <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/12/11/property-insurance-compensation-executives-legislature-special-session/" target="_blank">repeatedly found by state officials as the reason why companies go insolvent</a>. In one 2009 insolvency, auditors wrote that executives were “stripping the company of cash” as it was going out of business. The ratings agency AM Best last year found that affiliate relationships<b> </b>were the third-leading cause of insolvencies nationwide between 2000 and 2022, <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2024/12/18/805231.htm" target="_blank">after catastrophe losses and fraud, Insurance Journal reported</a>.</p><p>Still,<b> </b>it’s unlikely Florida<b> </b>regulators knew the full scope of insurance money-shifting arrangements until 2021, when lawmakers <a href="http://laws.flrules.org/files/Ch_2021-077.pdf" target="_blank">gave them the ability</a> to demand more information from insurers and affiliates.</p><p>Using that power,<b> </b>the state’s then-commissioner, David Altmaier, paid a Connecticut-based consultant<b> </b>nearly $150,000<b> </b>to parse through the information the companies provided. Several companies turned over incomplete data, according to the study.</p><p>Between 2017 and 2019, the insurers in the study (minus a couple of outliers) showed a net loss of $432 million.</p><p>Their affiliate companies showed a net income of $1.8 billion.</p><p>With all 53 companies included, the industry recorded $61 million in net income, and affiliates made about $14 billion in net income, according to the study. Those figures likely include national carriers that also provide auto insurance.</p><p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25540452-affiliated-fee-analysis-executive-summary/" target="_blank">The author noted</a> that the affiliates of Florida-based companies were profitable even after they injected<b> </b>$485 million back into the insurers and<b> </b>waived $208 million in fees during the three years, steps made to help keep the insurers afloat.</p><p>In the author’s opinion, 19 of the 30 Florida-based companies that provided data were paying fees<b> </b>to their affiliate companies that were “not fair and reasonable.”</p><p>The numbers in the study are “eye-popping” and raise questions about why regulators would allow such financial arrangements, said Birny Birnbaum, executive director of the Center for Economic Justice and a former chief economist at the Texas Department of Insurance.</p><p>“It’s unclear why (the Office of Insurance Regulation) isn’t doing anything about it,” Birnbaum said.</p><p>Regulators this year are asking lawmakers to define “fair and reasonable” to include the actual cost of the service provided, the overall health of the insurer and how much in dividends were paid out. Regulators asked for that in 2023 <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2023/04/28/florida-legislature-insurance-insolvencies-premiums-profits/" target="_blank">but lawmakers rejected it</a>, claiming it would “upset the apple cart” of Florida’s insurance industry.</p><p>The office’s proposed legislation would also require fees to affiliates be paid in dollar amounts, instead of percentages. Affiliates will typically charge the insurance company fees of between 20% and 34% of premiums, which results in more money for the affiliates when premiums go up.</p><p>The office has canceled or modified some companies’ agreements. In 2023, for example, one company’s contract with an affiliate was canceled after regulators discovered that the affiliate was charging the insurer additional fees on top of the cost of the services being provided, according to the office.</p></section></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>After another round of mass layoffs and reports of slashed stock options for remaining employees, Meta has like clockwork opted to reward its top executives with a substantial bonus increase.</p>
<p>The Facebook giant revealed in a government <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680125000021/meta-20250213.htm" rel="nofollow">filing</a> that its Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee (CNGC) approved a target annual bonus increase for its top executive officers bar CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The bonus was raised from 75 percent of base salary to a whopping 200 percent, effective with the 2025 annual performance period.</p>
<p>"Following this increase, the target total cash compensation for the named executive officers (other than the CEO) falls at approximately the 50th percentile of the Peer Group Target Cash Compensation," the filing notes. It added that prior to the adjustment, those executives were only at or below the 15th percentile in total cash compensation compared to their peers.&nbsp;</p>

    

<p>According to Meta's April 2024 proxy <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/8c7f110d-9cc4-4034-b356-ece89d4cb1c5.pdf" rel="nofollow">statement</a> [PDF], CTO Andrew Bosworth's base salary was $945,000. His actual eligible earnings were slightly lower due to the timing of his raise. However, factoring in a 75 percent target bonus and Meta's 150 percent company performance multiplier for 2023, his total bonus payout amounted to about $1.05 million.</p>

        


        

<p>Assuming Bosworth's salary remains the same, and Meta's company performance percentage stays at 150 percent in 2025, the new 200 percent target bonus would push his bonus to nearly $3 million. That's before any stock-based compensation and other add-ons. And he's not even the highest-paid member of Meta's named executive team.</p>
<p>For balance's sake, and some might find this hard to swallow but, $3 million annual cash compensation for a CTO in Bosworth's position is about right for Silicon Valley; it's nothing outrageous, relatively speaking. The vast majority of his pay package is in shares; in 2023 for instance, he was awarded more than $20 million in stock. The salary, like for many in his role, is the cherry on top of an enormous cake.</p>

        

<p>Some of that bonus cash, though, might be coming from Meta's latest round of layoffs, which saw <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/10/meta_to_toss_5_of/">around 3,700 people</a> - about five percent of its workforce - axed this month. The cut reportedly targeted low performers, and followed a year in which the biz reported a net income of $62.36 billion, a 59 percent year-over-year increase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This comes <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/67a4c030-a7f6-47af-bab0-a998f0a09506" rel="nofollow">reports</a> surfaced this week that Meta has cut back on its yearly distribution of stock options by 10 percent to most staff, though we do note that the corp's share price has climbed 10 percent in the past month, and 46 percent for the past year.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Meta to confirm reports of the stock option cut.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zuckerberg started 2025 by describing Meta's plans for the year as "intense," with massive AI investments lined up as the Facebook maker shifts focus beyond its struggling <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/10/meta_metaverse_report/">metaverse</a> ambitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following OpenAI's announcement that it and its partners plan to invest up to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/22/openai_stargate_ai_datacenter_company/">$500 billion</a> in an AI infrastructure project dubbed Stargate, Zuckerberg announced his own AI spending plans - Meta would pour $60 billion or more to expand its AI infrastructure in 2025.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>"This is a massive effort, and over the coming years it will drive our core products and business, unlock historic innovation, and extend American technology leadership," Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/pfbid0219ude255AKkmk4JAueXZeZ9zpjNYio2tBkd7bNmCaRbJ6iJaVVjypUgDg78CNdq5l" rel="nofollow">said</a> of the effort. Hopefully it will prove more successful than that Metaverse shift for the sake of those executives' bonuses.&nbsp;®</p>

It's about trying to come up with a working solution in a problem domain that you don't fully understand and don't have time to understand.</p><p>It's about skimming <a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/129.html">great oceans of APIs</a> that you could spend years studying and learning, but the market will have moved on by then and that's no fun anyway, so you cut and paste from examples and manage to get by without a full picture of the architecture supporting your app.</p><p>It's about reading between the lines of documentation and guessing at how edge cases are handled and whether or not your assumptions will still hold true two months or two years from now.</p><p>It's about the constant evolutionary changes that occur in the language definition, the compiler, the libraries, the application framework, and the underlying operating system, that all snowball together and keep you in maintenance mode instead of making real improvements. </p><p>It's about getting derailed by hairline fractures in otherwise reliable tools, and apparently being the first person to discover that a PNG image with four bits-per-pixel and an alpha channel crashes the decoder, then having to work around that.</p><p>One approach is to dig in and power through all the obstacles. If you're fresh out of school, there are free Starbucks lattes down the hall, and all your friends are still at the office at 2 AM, too...well, that works. But then you have to do it again. And again. It's always a last second skid at 120 miles per hour with brakes smoking and tires shredding that makes all the difference between success and failure, but you pulled off another miracle and survived to do it again.</p><p>I still like to build things, and if there's no one else to do it, then I'll do it myself. I keep improving the <a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/77.html">the tiny Perl script</a> that puts together this site, because that tiny Perl script is unobtrusive and reliable and lets me focus on writing. I have a handy little image compositing tool that's less than 28 kilobytes of C and Erlang source. I know how it works inside and out, and I can make changes to it in less time than than it takes to coax what I want out of ImageMagick.</p><p>But large scale, high stress coding? I may have to admit that's a young man's game.</p><p><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/154.html" id="perm">permalink</a> <i>October 3, 2012</i></p><h2>previously</h2><ul><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/153.html">Digging Out from Years of Homogeneous Computing</a></li><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/152.html">What's Your Hidden Agenda?</a></li><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/151.html">Minimalism in an Age of Tremendous Hardware</a></li><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/150.html">The Goal is to be Like a Bad Hacker Movie</a></li><li><a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/149.html">Hopefully More Controversial Programming Opinions</a></li></ul></div></div>]]></description>
