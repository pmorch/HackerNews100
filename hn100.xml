<p>Last Updated 27/12/2023</p>

<p>This is a work in progress, both design and implementation. Cake source itself is being used to validate the concepts.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Abstract</h2>

<p>The objective is to statically check code and prevent bugs, including memory bugs. For this task, the compiler needs information that humans typically gather from the context. For example, names like "destroy" or "init" serve as hints, along with documentation and sometimes the implementation itself.</p>

<p>The compiler doesn't read documentation, nor does it operate in the same way as humans. Instead, a formal means of communication with the compiler is necessary. To facilitate this, new qualifiers have been created, and new methods of communication with the compiler have been established.</p>

<p>In the end, we still have the same language, but with a c_type_system++ version of C. This c_type_system++ can be disabled, and the language remains unmodified.</p>

<p>The creation of these rules follows certain principles, one of which is to default to safety.
In cases of uncertainty, the compiler should seek clarification. While C programmers retain the freedom 
to code as they wish, they must either persuade the compiler or disable analysis in specific code sections.
A human factor must be considered to ensure that annotations do not make the work too boring with 
excessive details. In this regard, selecting defaults that cover the most common cases is crucial.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Owner Objects</h2>

<p>An <strong>owner object</strong> is an object referencing another object and managing its lifetime. </p>

<p>The most common type of owner objects are pointers, often referred as <strong>owner pointers</strong>. An owner pointer is created with the qualifier owner, as illustrated in Listing 1:</p>

<p><strong>Listing 1 - Owner Pointer to FILE</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
  FILE *owner f = fopen("file.txt", "r"); 
  if (f)
    fclose(f);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>owner</code> is actually a macro declared in ownership as _Owner. </p>

<p>The ownership mechanism has some rules that will be listed gradually throughout the text.</p>

<p><strong>Rule</strong>: An <strong>owner object</strong> is always the unique owner of the referenced object.</p>

<p><strong>Rule</strong>: When owner objects are copied the ownership is transfered.</p>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> Before the end of its lifetime, owner objects must move the ownership of the objects they own. </p>

<p>For example, in Listing 2, the ownership of the owner pointer <code>f</code> is transferred to <code>f2</code>:</p>

<p><strong>Listing 2 - Assignment of Owner Objects is a Move</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    FILE *owner f = fopen("file.txt", "r");
    FILE *owner f2 = f; /*MOVED*/
    if (f2)
       fclose(f2); /*MOVED*/
}
</code></pre>

<p>Invoking a function <code>fclose</code> is analogous to assignment of the argument <code>f2</code>, resulting in the transfer of ownership of <code>f2</code> to the function parameter.  Listing 3, shows the declaration of <code>fclose</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Listing 3 - Declaration of close</strong></p>

<pre><code>void fclose(FILE *owner p);
</code></pre>

<h3 id="toc_2">Non-pointer owner objects</h3>

<p>We can have other types of <strong>owner objects</strong>. For instance, Berkeley sockets use an integer to identify the socket, as shown in listing 4:</p>

<p><strong>Listing 4 - Non-Pointer owners objects</strong></p>

<pre><code> owner int server_socket =
     socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
 /*...*/
 close(server_socket);
</code></pre>

<p>The location and usage of qualifier owner is similar of const qualifier. For pointers it goes after <code>*</code>, for this socket sample it can be before int.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">View Objects</h3>

<p>A <strong>view object</strong> is an object referencing another object without managing its lifetime. </p>

<p><strong>Rule</strong> The lifetime of the referenced object must be bigger than the lifetime of the view object.</p>

<p>The most common view objects are pointers called <strong>view pointers</strong>. </p>

<p>The view qualifier is not necessary for pointers, since it's the default behavior. When an owner object is copied to a view object, the ownership is not transferred, as shown in Listing 5:</p>

<p><strong>Listing 5 - Calling Function with View Parameters</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void use_file(FILE *f) {}

int main() {
    FILE *owner f = fopen("file.txt", "r");
    if (f) {
        use_file(f); /*NOT MOVED*/
        fclose(f);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When a struct or union have at least one owner object it makes the struct a owner object too.</p>

<p>When a <strong>view</strong> qualifier is used in structs, it makes all members as view objects. Listing 6.</p>

<p><strong>Listing 6 - A view parameter</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct X {   
  char *owner text;   
};  

void f(view struct X x) { /*...*/ }  

int main() {
    struct X x = {};
    f(x); /*NOT MOVED*/    
    free(x.text);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is interesting to compare against const qualifier. 
While const adds a qualifier "const" "view" removes the qualifier "owner".</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">Returning view pointers.</h3>

<p>We cannot return local variables as view pointers.</p>

<pre><code>int * f()
{
   int a = 1;
   return &amp;a;
}
int main()
{
  int * p = f();   
  //warning: function returns address of 
  //local variable [-Wreturn-local-addr]
}
</code></pre>

<p>But we can return static variables and function arguments.</p>

<pre><code>static int a = 1;

int * f()
{   
   return &amp;a;
}
int * f2(int *p) {
   return p;
}

int main()
{
  int * p = f();
  int b = 1;
  p = f2(&amp;b);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Another sample:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int * max(int * p1, int * p2) {  
 return *p1 &gt; *p2 ? p1 : p2;
}

int main(){  
   int * p = NULL;
   int a  = 1;
   {
      int b = 2;
      p = max(&amp;a,  &amp;b);
   }
   printf("%d", *p);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Examining the implementation reveals that the returned view pointer's lifetime can be that of either 'a' or 'b'. Our goal is to set contracts at the declaration level. Following the concept of ensuring safety by default, we assume that the returned view pointers have the shortest scope, limited to the function call.<br>
(Cake is not doing this check at this moment) </p>

<h3 id="toc_5">View pointer as struct members</h3>

<p>Consider this sample.</p>

<pre><code>struct X {  
 struct Y * pY;  
};  
struct Y {  
 char * owner name;  
};  
</code></pre>

<p>An object Y pointed by pY must live longer than object X.<br>
This check must be done at instantiation.</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">Deleting Owner Pointers</h3>

<p><strong>Owner pointers</strong> take on the responsibility of owning the pointed object and its associated memory, treating them as distinct entities. A common practice is to implement a delete function to release both resources, as illustrated in Listing 7:</p>

<p><strong>Listing 7 - Implementing the delete function</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct X { 
  char *owner text; 
};

void x_delete(struct X *owner p) {
  if (p) {
    /*releasing the object*/ 
    free(p-&gt;text);
    
    /*releasing the memory*/ 
    free(p); 
  }
}

int main() {
  struct X * owner pX = calloc( 1, sizeof * pX);
  if (pX) {
    /*...*/;
    x_delete( pX); 
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the object is created on the stack, we can implement a destructor, as shown in Listing 8:</p>

<p><strong>Listing 8 - Implementing a destructor</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct X {
    char *owner text;
};  

void x_destroy(struct X x) {
    free(x.text);
}  

int main() {
    struct X x = {};
    /*...*/
    x_destroy(x); /*x is moved*/
}
</code></pre>

<p>However in C, structs are typically passed by pointer rather than by value. To transfer the ownership of an owner object to a pointer, Cake introduces a new qualifier, <strong>obj_owner</strong>. </p>

<p>A pointer qualified with <strong>obj_owner</strong> is the owner of the pointed object but not responsible for managing its memory.</p>

<p>Listing 9 illustrates how to implement a destructor using a obj_owner pointer parameter.</p>

<p><strong>Listing 9 - Implementing a destructor using obj_owner</strong></p>

<pre><code>struct X {
#include &lt;ownership.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct X {
    char *owner text;
};

void x_destroy(struct X *obj_owner x) {
    free(x-&gt;text);
    /*x is not the owner of the memory*/
}

int main() {
    struct X x = {};
    /*more code*/
    x_destroy(&amp;x); /*x is moved*/
}
</code></pre>

<p>In order to prevent moving from a non owner object, only <code>address of expressions</code> to <code>obj_owner</code> are allowed. For instance, listing 10 shows we cannot move a view pointer.</p>

<p><strong>Listing 10 - Non address of expression or owner pointer.</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct X {
 struct Y * p;
};

void y_destroy(struct Y * obj_owner p);

void f(struct X * x) {
  //Error: parameter 1 requires a pointer to owner object
  //Error: pointed object is not owner
  y_destroy(x-&gt;p); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can copy an owner pointer to an <strong>obj_owner</strong> pointer. In this scenario, only the ownership of the pointed object is transferred, not the memory ownership. Listing 11 illustrates how we can use <code>x_destroy</code> in the implementation of <code>x_delete</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Listing 11 - Using <code>x_destroy</code> to implement <code>x_delete</code></strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct X {
  char *owner text; 
};

void x_destroy(struct X *obj_owner x) {
  free(x-&gt;text); 
}

void x_delete(struct X *owner p) { 
  if (p) {
    x_destroy(p); /* *p is moved*/
    free(p);
  }
}

int main() {
   struct X * owner pX = calloc( 1, sizeof * pX);
   if (pX) {
     /*...*/;
     x_delete( pX); 
   }
 } 
</code></pre>

<p>In C, array types in arguments are pointers. This characteristics is preserved.</p>

<p>To use owner qualifier in array we do. (Just like const)</p>

<pre><code>void f(int a[owner])
{
  free(a);
}
</code></pre>

<p>But I think this is quite uncommon.</p>

<h2 id="toc_7">Static analysis - Checking the rules at compile time</h2>

<p>Let's revisit our first example:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
  FILE *owner f = fopen("file.txt", "r"); 
  if (f)
    fclose(f);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The flow analysis must ensure that when the owner pointer <code>f</code> goes out of scope, it does not own any objects. At the end of the scope, <code>f</code> can be either null or moved, and both states ensure that there are no remaining resources.</p>

<p>To check the ownership rules, the compiler uses six states:</p>

<ul>
<li>uninitialized</li>
<li>moved</li>
<li>null</li>
<li>not-null</li>
<li>zero</li>
<li>not-zero</li>
</ul>

<p>We can print these states using the <strong>static_debug</strong> declaration. We can also assert the variable is at a certain state using the <strong>static_state</strong> declaration. Listing 12 shows this usage:</p>

<p><strong>Listing 12 - Usage of static_state and static_debug</strong></p>

<pre><code>int main() {
 int a;   
 static_state(a, "uninitialized");  
 static_debug(a);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>c:/main.c:4:2: note: static_debug
 4 | static_debug(a);
   | ^~~~~~~~~~~~
 a == "uninitialized"
</code></pre>

<p>As we have just seen, the <strong>uninitialized</strong> state is the state of variables that are declared but not initialized. </p>

<p>The compiler ensures that we don't read uninitialized objects.</p>

<pre><code>void f1(int i);
int main() {
   int i;
   f1(i); //error: uninitialized object 'i'
}
</code></pre>

<p>The other situation were variables becomes <strong>uninitialized</strong> is when moving ownership to function parameters. This prevents bugs like double free or use after free.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct X {
  char * owner text;
};

void x_delete(struct X * owner p)
{
    if (p) {
      free(p-&gt;text);
      free(p);    
    }
}

void f(struct X * p){}

int main() {   
   struct X * owner p = malloc(sizeof(struct X));
   p-&gt;text = malloc(10);
   x_delete(p);
   f(p); //uninitialized object 'p'
}
</code></pre>

<p>When objects are moved within a local scope, the state is "moved" rather than "uninitialized." The "moved" state is similar to the "uninitialized" state. For instance, it's not possible to move an object that has already been moved.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct X {
  char * owner text;
};

void x_delete(struct X * owner p)
{
    if (p)
    {
      free(p-&gt;text);
      free(p);    
    }
}

void f(struct X * p){}

int main() {   
   struct X * owner p = malloc(sizeof(struct X));
   p-&gt;text = malloc(10);
  
   struct X * owner p2 = 0;
   p2 = p; //MOVED
  
   f(p); //error: object 'p' was moved
   x_delete(p2);
}

</code></pre>

<p>The "moved" state was introduced instead of solely relying on the "uninitialized" state because static analysis benefits from having more information on local variables. "Moved" objects may, in some cases, serve as view objects. For example, in listing XX, the x object has been moved to x2, but it is safe to use x as "view" object even after the move.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct X {
  char * owner text;
};

int main() {   
  struct X x = {0};
  //...
  struct X x2 = {0};  
  x2 = x; //MOVED
  free(x2.text);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: The current implementation of cake does not handle all necessary states to ensure the safe usage of moved objects.</p>

<p>A common scenario where uninitialized objects are utilized is when a pointer to an uninitialized object is passed to an "init" function. This situation is addressed by the qualifier <strong>out</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

struct X {
  char * owner text;
};

int init(out struct X *p, const char * text)
{
  //SAFE
  p-&gt;text = strdup(text);
}

int main() {   
  struct X x;
  init(&amp;x, "text");  
  free(x.text);
}
  
</code></pre>

<p>The "out" qualifier is necessary at the caller side and at the implementation.</p>

<p>The caller is informed that the argument must be uninitialized, and the implementation is aware that it can safely override the contents of the object <code>p-&gt;text = strdup(text);</code> without causing a memory leak.</p>

<p>There is no explicit "initialized" state. When referring to initialized objects, it means the state is neither "moved" nor "uninitialized."</p>

<p><strong>Rule</strong> By default, the parameters of a function are considered initialized. The exception is created with out qualifier.</p>

<p>For instance, at set implementation we need free text before assignment.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

struct X {
  char * owner text;
};

int init(out struct X *p, const char * text)
{
  //SAFE
  p-&gt;text = strdup(text);
}

int set(struct X *p, const char * text)
{
  free(p-&gt;text); //NECESSARY
  p-&gt;text = strdup(text);
}

int main() {   
  struct X x;
  init(&amp;x, "text1");
  set(&amp;x, "text2");   
  free(x.text);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule</strong> All objects passed as arguments must be initialized. The exception is when object is out qualified.</p>

<p><strong>Rule</strong>: We cannot pass initialized objects to <strong>out</strong> qualified object.</p>

<p>The <strong>null</strong> state means that owner objects are initialized and not referencing any object. Listing 13 shows a sample using owner pointers:</p>

<p><strong>Listing 13 - Null state</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt; 

int main() {
 void * owner p = nullptr;   
 static_state(p, "null"); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>not-null</strong> state indicates that the object is referencing some object.
The state can be a combination of possibilities like <strong>null</strong> and <strong>not-null</strong>. We can check possible combination using "or".
This particular combination <strong>null or not-null</strong> has a alias <strong>maybe-null</strong> as shown in listing 14.</p>

<p><strong>Listing 14 - not-null and maybe-null state</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main()
{
   void * owner p = malloc(1);
   if (p) {
     static_state(p, "not-null");
   }
   static_state(p, "maybe-null");   
   static_state(p, "null or not-null");
   free(p);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>zero</strong> state is used for non-owner objects to complement and support uninitialized checks.</p>

<p><strong>Rule</strong> Pointer parameters are consider not-null by default. The exception is created using the qualifier <strong>_Opt</strong>.  </p>

<p>To tell the compiler that the pointer can be null, we use the qualifier <strong>_Opt</strong>.</p>

<p>(Currently Cake is only doing null-checks if the -nullchecks option is passed to the compiler, the cake source itself has to move to nullchecks)</p>

<p><strong>Listing 15 - The zero state</strong></p>

<pre><code>int main()
{
   int i = 0;
   static_state(i, "zero");   
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Zero</strong> and <strong>null</strong> are different states. This difference is necessary because, for non-pointers like the socket sample, 0 does not necessarily means null. The compiler does not know the semantics for types that are not pointers. However, you can use <strong>static_set</strong> to override states. In Listing 16, we annotate that server_socket is null, which doesn't mean it is zero but indicates that it is not holding any resources and is safe to return without calling close.</p>

<p><strong>Listing 16 - Usage of static_set</strong></p>

<pre><code>  owner int server_socket =
     socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
  if (server_socket &lt; 0) {  
     static_set(server_socket, "null");
     return;
  }  
 /*...*/
 close(server_socket);
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>not-zero</strong> state is used for non-owner objects to indicate the value if not zero.</p>

<p>Similarly of  <strong>maybe-null</strong>, <strong>any</strong> is a alias for <strong>zero or not-zero</strong> state.</p>

<pre><code>int f();

int main() {   
    int i = f();
    static_state(i, "any");
}

</code></pre>

<p>By the way, the result of functions are never <strong>uninitialized</strong> by convention.</p>

<p>By default, pointers have the state <strong>maybe-null</strong> and other types have the state <strong>any</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Rule</strong>: Function never returns uninitialized objects.</p>

<p>Now let's consider <code>realloc</code> function.</p>

<pre><code>void * owner realloc( void *ptr, size_t new_size ); 
</code></pre>

<p>In the declaration of <code>realloc</code>, we are not moving the ptr. The reason for that is because the <code>ptr</code> may or may not be moved. If the function returns NULL, <code>ptr</code> was not moved. Listing 17 shows how <strong>static_set</strong> can be used.</p>

<p><strong>Listing 17 - Using static_set with realloc</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
int main()
{
  void * owner p = malloc(1);
  void * owner p2 = realloc(p, 2);
  if (p2 != 0)
  {
     // if p2 != 0 it  means p was moved
     static_set(p, "moved");
     p = p2;
  }    
  free(p);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Without the <code>static_set</code> we have this error   </p>

<pre><code>error: memory pointed by 'p' was not released before assignment.
 11 |     p = p2;
</code></pre>

<p>The state of an object is a combination of all possible states. For instance, let's print and check the state of <code>f</code> at listing 17.</p>

<p><strong>Listing 17 - Flow analysis</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
  FILE *owner f = fopen("file.txt", "r");
  if (f)
    fclose(f);  
  static_state(f, "uninitialized or null");  
}
</code></pre>

<p>When objects are moved to functions, the state is  <code>uninitialized</code>  that is the worst scenario of what can happens inside the function. When objects are moved inside the same source the state is <code>moved</code>.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
  FILE *owner f = fopen("file.txt", "r");  
  FILE *owner f2 = f; 
  static_state(f, "moved");  
  fclose(f2);
}  
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> We cannot discard owner objects as showed in listing 18.  </p>

<p><strong>Listing 18 - owner objects cannot be discarded.</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
  //error: ignoring the result of owner type
  fopen("file.txt", "r");   
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> Before the assignment of owner objects, the compiler checks if the owner object is not holding any resource, as shown in Listing 19:</p>

<p><strong>Listing 19 - Check before assignment</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
  FILE * owner file = fopen("file.txt", "r");
  
  //error: memory pointed by 'file' was not 
  //released before assignment.  
  file = fopen("file.txt", "r");
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="toc_8">Function Parameters</h3>

<p>For function parameters, the state of the object is initialized by default.</p>

<p><strong>Listing 20 - States of function parameters</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt; 
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

struct X {
  char *owner text; 
};

void set(struct  X * x, const char * name) {
  free(x-&gt;text);
  x-&gt;text = strdup(name);
}

</code></pre>

<p>When the argument can be uninitialized we use the qualifier _Out.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt; 
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

struct X {
  char *owner text; 
};

void init(out struct X * x) {
  x-&gt;text = strdup("a");
}

void set(struct  X * x, const char * name) {
  free(x-&gt;text);
  x-&gt;text = strdup(name);
}

</code></pre>

<p>After calling init the object may or not be initialized.</p>

<p>At  listing 21, we show how <strong>static_set</strong> can be used to set states. </p>

<p><strong>Listing 21 - Using static_set</strong></p>

<pre><code>TODO
</code></pre>

<p>But when possible we can use assert that works both as static information and runtime check in debug.</p>

<p>Consider the following sample where we have a linked list. Each node has owner pointer to next. The next pointer of the tail of the list is always pointing to null, unless we have a bug. But the compiler does not know <code>list-&gt;tail-&gt;next</code> is null. Using assert we give this inform to the compiler and we also have a runtime check for possible logic bugs.</p>

<p><strong>Listing 22 shows the usage of assert.</strong> </p>

<pre><code>
#include &lt;ownership.h&gt; 
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct node {
 char * owner text;
 struct node* owner next;
};

struct list {
  struct node * owner head;
  struct node * tail;
};

void list_append(struct list* list, struct node* owner node)
{
  if (list-&gt;head == NULL) {
      list-&gt;head = node;
   }
   else {
      assert(list-&gt;tail-&gt;next == 0);
      list-&gt;tail-&gt;next = node;
   }
   list-&gt;tail = node;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> A non-owner object cannot be copied to a owner object. </p>

<p>But, the null pointer constant is converted to a null owner pointer. Se listing 23.</p>

<p><strong>Listing 23 - non owner cannot be copied to owner</strong></p>

<pre><code>FILE * f();
int main() {  
   FILE * owner file = f(); //ERROR   
   FILE * owner file2 = 0;  //OK
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> A view pointer parameter cannot leave the scope with moved/uninitialized objects. Listing 24</p>

<p><strong>Listing 24 - Messing with view parameters</strong></p>

<pre><code>
#include &lt;ownership.h&gt; 
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct X
{
  char * owner name;
};

void x_destroy(struct X * obj_owner p)
{
  free(p-&gt;name); 
}

struct Y
{
   struct X x;
}

void f(struct Y * p) {
   // parameter 'p' is leaving scoped with a uninitialized
   // object 'p.x.name'
   x_destroy(&amp;p-&gt;x);
}
  
int main() {
   struct Y  y = {};
   y.x.name = strdup("a");
   f(&amp;y);
   free(y.x.name);
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, listing 25 is correct, because before the end of scope states of the parameters are restored.</p>

<p><strong>Listing 25 - swap function</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct X
{
  char * owner name;
};

void x_destroy(struct X * obj_owner p)
{
  free(p-&gt;name); 
}

void x_swap(struct X * a, struct X * b) {
  struct X temp = *a;
  *a = *b;
  *b = temp;
}
  
int main() {
   struct X x1 = {};
   struct X x2 = {};
  
   x_swap(&amp;x1, &amp;x2);
  
   x_destroy(&amp;x1);
   x_destroy(&amp;x2);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> When objects are moved to functions, they become uninitialized. This prevents bugs like double free. Listing 26. </p>

<pre><code> int main() {
  void * owner p = malloc(1);
  free(p);
  free(p); //ERROR p is uninitialized
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> moved objects cannot be moved. Listing 27.</p>

<p><strong>Listing 27 - We cannot move a moved or uninitialized object</strong></p>

<pre><code>int * owner p1 = ...;
int * owner p2 = p1;
int * owner p3 = p1; //ERROR p1 was moved
</code></pre>

<pre><code>int * owner f(int * owner p1) {
 int * owner p2 = p1;
 return p1; //ERROR p1 was moved
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> When coping a owner object to to a view object the compiler must check the lifetime. Listing 28</p>

<p><strong>Listing 28 - Lifetime check</strong></p>

<pre><code>void using_file(FILE * f);

struct X { 
  char *owner text; 
};  
  
struct X * owner make_owner();  

int main() {
  struct X *p = 0;  
  {
    struct X * owner p2 = make_owner();  
    p = p2; //error p lives longer than p2  
    free(p2);
  }

  using_file(fopen("file.txt", "r")); //ERROR
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> Returned objects must be valid.</p>

<p><strong>Listing 34 - Assuming returned objects are valid</strong></p>

<pre><code>void* owner malloc(unsigned long size);
void free(void* owner ptr);

struct X { 
  char *owner text; 
};

struct X * owner f();

int main()
{
   struct X * owner pX = f();
   if (pX) {
     static_state(pX-&gt;text, "maybe-null");
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> Arguments must be valid.</p>

<p><strong>Listing 35 - Function Arguments cannot be in a moved or uninitialized state</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt; 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
struct X { 
  char *owner text; 
};

void f(struct X * p);

int main() {
   struct X x;
   f(&amp;x); //ERROR
     
   struct X x1 = {0};
   struct X x2 = x1; //MOVED
   f(&amp;x1); //ERROR
}
</code></pre>

<p>For this reason, an qualifier <code>out</code> can be added to allow passing unitalicized objects.</p>

<pre><code>void  free(void* _Owner p);
char* _Owner strdup(const char* s);

struct X {
    char* _Owner s;
};

void init(_Out struct X *  px)
{
    static_state(px, "maybe-null");
    static_state(px-&gt;s, "uninitialized");
    px-&gt;s = strdup("a");
}

void set(struct X* px, const char* text)
{
    static_state(px, "maybe-null");
    static_state(px-&gt;s, "maybe-null");
    free(px-&gt;s);
    px-&gt;s = strdup(text);
}

int main() {
    struct X x;
    init(&amp;x);
    set(&amp;x, "b");
    free(x.s);
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="toc_9">Ownership Feature Strategy (Inspired by stdbool.h)</h2>

<p>If the compiler supports ownership checks and qualifiers such as _Owner, _View, _Obj_view, etc., it must define  <code>__STDC_OWNERSHIP__</code>. </p>

<p>However, even if the compiler implements ownership, it is not active by default. The objective is to have a smooth transition allowing some files without checks. For instance, a thirty part code inside your project.</p>

<p>For instance, when compiling this file, even if the compiler supports ownership we don't have errors or warnings because the checks are not enabled by default.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main() {
  void * p = malloc(1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>A second define <code>__OWNERSHIP_H__</code>, is used to enable ownership.
This define is set when we include <code>&lt;ownership.h&gt;</code> at beginning. </p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ownership.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main() {
  void * p = malloc(1); //error: missing owner qualifier
}
</code></pre>

<p>The other advantage of having a <code>&lt;ownership.h&gt;</code> is because owner is a macro that can be defined as empty in case the compiler does not support ownership, allowing the same code to be compiled in compilers without ownership support. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Currently cake is using the same headers of VS and GCC that are not aware of ownership. For this reason, <code>ownership.h</code> itself is declaring malloc etc and the second declaration of malloc inside stdlib.h will not complain with the discrepancy of ownership qualifiers between declarations.</p>

The PS5 'Portal' companion device can now do more than just remote play, thanks to a new hack that sees PSP emulation running on the handheld.
</p>
<p>Well, that didn’t take too long. Sony’s remote-play <strong>PlayStation Portal handheld has been hacked</strong> — meaning it can now be used for emulation, <em>perfect for playing back your PSP collection perhaps</em>? </p><p>The $200, <a href="https://overkill.wtf/sony-playstation-portal-project-q/" rel="noreferrer">Android-powered companion device</a> was first launched in November of last year, and since then folks have been curious as to what the device could do beyond its oddly limited PS5 streaming capabilities. </p><figure><img src="https://overkill.wtf/content/images/2024/02/PSPortal_1.jpg" alt="PlayStation Portal" loading="lazy" width="900" height="675" srcset="https://overkill.wtf/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/PSPortal_1.jpg 600w, https://overkill.wtf/content/images/2024/02/PSPortal_1.jpg 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>The PlayStation Portal, being used as Sony intended</span></figcaption></figure><p>Long-time PlayStation hacker Andy Nguyen is one of a handful of enthusiasts who has been working hard on efforts to bring popular PSP emulator <a href="https://www.ppsspp.org/?ref=overkill.wtf" rel="noreferrer">PPSSPP</a> to the device — and now, following a month long effort, the PlayStation Portal can do more than just stream whatever is playing on your PS5.</p><figure><img src="https://overkill.wtf/content/images/2024/02/andy-nguyen-playstation-portal-hack.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="796" height="615" srcset="https://overkill.wtf/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/andy-nguyen-playstation-portal-hack.jpg 600w, https://overkill.wtf/content/images/2024/02/andy-nguyen-playstation-portal-hack.jpg 796w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>The PlayStaton Portal running a PSP game via the PPSSPP emulator</span></figcaption></figure><p>Yep, <a href="https://twitter.com/theflow0/status/1759627938910089575?ref=overkill.wtf" rel="noreferrer">according to Nguyen</a> the Portal can now run the PPSSPP emulator, meaning you can theoretically spin up Lumines or some Vice City Stories on the curious handheld. </p><p>Currently the trio behind this hack state that "<em>there's no release planned in the near future</em>" adding that there is still "<em>much more work to be done</em>".

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview</h2>
<p dir="auto">ENDGAME is a universal dashboard exploit for the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Xbox</a>. This exploit has been carefully engineered to be compatible across all retail kernel and dashboard versions released for the original Xbox. It does not require a game, or even a working DVD drive -- <em>only a memory card.</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Special credit belongs to <a href="https://twitter.com/shutterbug20002" rel="nofollow">@shutterbug2000</a> for the initial discovery of this vector within the dash and the first to demonstrate code execution against it. With further research, ENDGAME was developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/gaasedelen" rel="nofollow">@gaasedelen</a> leveraging an adjacent vulnerability that offered greater control and facilitated a more ubiquitous exploitation strategy.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Disclaimer</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>This project does NOT use any copyrighted code, or help circumvent security mechanisms of an Xbox console.</strong> Upon success, ENDGAME will launch a <a href="http://toogam.bespin.org/xboxmod/site/signxbe.htm" rel="nofollow">habibi</a>-signed XBE from the root of the memory card. It does not patch kernel code or allow you to launch retail-signed executables.</p>
<p dir="auto">By using this software, you accept the risk of experiencing total loss or destruction of data on the console in question.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building</h2>
<p dir="auto">The exploit files can be generated from scratch using Python 3 + NASM on Windows.</p>
<p dir="auto">Example usage is provided below:</p>

<p dir="auto">Successful output should look something like the following:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h2>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Q: Is this a softmod?</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><em>A: No, by itself, ENDGAME is not a softmod. But it will make softmodding significantly more accessible as the community integrates it into existing softmod solutions.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Q: What is new about this exploit?</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><em>A: This exploit will enable people to softmod any revision of the original Xbox without needing a specific game. It will also allow people to easily launch a homebrew XBE (such as the <a href="https://insignia.live/connect" rel="nofollow">Insignia setup assistant</a>, or content scanning tools) by simply inserting a memory card into an unmodded Xbox.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Q: I don't have a memory card, can I use something else?</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><em>A: Yes, any FATX-formatted compatible USB device and controller port dongle should work.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Q: Why am I getting Error 21 after placing my own XBE on the memory card?</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><em>A: Your XBE must be signed using the <a href="http://toogam.bespin.org/xboxmod/site/signxbe.htm" rel="nofollow">habibi</a> key. Several tools can do this, <code>xbedump</code> being the most popular.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Q: Why does my habibi-signed XBE result in a black screen with ENDGAME but not on a modded xbox?</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><em>A: The most common explanation is that your XBE may be using the Debug/XDK <strong>kernel thunk</strong> &amp; <strong>entry point</strong> <a href="https://xboxdevwiki.net/Xbe" rel="nofollow">XOR keys</a> rather than the retail ones, resulting in a crash.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Q: I triggered ENDGAME but my system quickly rebooted to the dash rather than my XBE...</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><em>A: While this should be uncommon, it means the exploit probably crashed. It's recommended to navigate straight to the memory card on a cold boot for successful exploitation.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Q: My XBE requires multiple files and external assets to run, will it work with ENDGAME?</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><em>A: No. Currently, ENDGAME is only structured to copy &amp; execute a standalone XBE.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Q: How does this exploit work?</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><em>A: The exploit targets an integer overflow in the dashboard's handling of savegame images. When the dash attempts to parse the specially crafted images on the memory card, ENDGAME obtains arbitrary code execution.</em></li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Federal Trade Commission is seeking public comment on a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/r207000_impersonation_snprm.pdf">supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking</a> that would prohibit the impersonation of individuals. The proposed rule changes would extend protections of the new <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/r207000_govt_biz_impersonation_rule.pdf">rule on government and business impersonation</a> that is being finalized by the Commission today.</p><p>The agency is taking this action in light of <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/02/nationwide-fraud-losses-top-10-billion-2023-ftc-steps-efforts-protect-public">surging complaints</a> around impersonation fraud, as well as public outcry about the harms caused to consumers and to impersonated individuals. Emerging technology – including AI-generated deepfakes – threatens to turbocharge this scourge, and the FTC is committed to using all of its tools to detect, deter, and halt impersonation fraud.</p><p>The Commission is also seeking comment on whether the revised rule should declare it unlawful for a firm, such as an AI platform that creates images, video, or text, to provide goods or services that they know or have reason to know is being used to harm consumers through impersonation.</p><p>“Fraudsters are using AI tools to impersonate individuals with eerie precision and at a much wider scale. With voice cloning and other AI-driven scams on the rise, protecting Americans from impersonator fraud is more critical than ever,” said FTC Chair Lina M. Khan. “Our proposed expansions to the final impersonation rule would do just that, strengthening the FTC’s toolkit to address AI-enabled scams impersonating individuals.”</p><p>The supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking is being issued in response to comments received during the public comment period on the government and business impersonation rule that pointed to the additional threats and harms posed by impersonation of individuals. As scammers find new ways to defraud consumers, including through AI-generated deepfakes, this proposal will help the agency deter fraud and secure redress for harmed consumers.</p><p><strong>Final Rule on Government and Business Impersonation</strong></p><p>In addition to the supplemental notice, the FTC has finalized the Government and Business Impersonation Rule, which gives the agency stronger tools to combat scammers who impersonate businesses or government agencies, enabling the FTC to directly file federal court cases aimed at forcing scammers to return the money they made from government or business impersonation scams. This is particularly important given the Supreme Court’s <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/19-508_l6gn.pdf">April 2021 ruling in AMG Capital Management LLC v. FTC</a>, which significantly limited the agency’s ability to require defendants to return money to injured consumers.</p><p>Government and business impersonation scams have cost consumers billions of dollars in recent years, and both categories saw significant increases in reports to the FTC in 2023. The rule authorizes the agency to fight these scams more effectively.</p><p>For example, the rule would enable the FTC to directly seek monetary relief in federal court from scammers that:</p><ul><li><strong>Use government seals or business logos</strong>&nbsp;when communicating with consumers by mail or online.</li><li><strong>Spoof government and business emails and web addresses</strong>, including spoofing “.gov” email addresses or using lookalike email addresses or websites that rely on misspellings of a company’s name.</li><li><strong>Falsely imply government or business affiliation</strong>&nbsp;by using terms that are known to be affiliated with a government agency or business (e.g., stating “I’m calling from the Clerk’s Office” to falsely imply affiliation with a court of law).&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>The publication of the final rule comes after the two rounds of public comment in response to an advance notice of proposed rulemaking issued in December 2021, a notice of proposed rulemaking issued in September 2022, and an informal hearing in May 2023.</p><p>The Commission vote to issue the final rule and the supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking and to publish them in the Federal Register was 3-0. Chair Lina M. Khan issued a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/statement-chair-khan-joined-commissioners-slaughter-bedoya-regarding-final-trade-regulation-rule" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="509d98e1-771d-47f3-80b6-77b50e8129b5" data-entity-substitution="canonical">separate statement</a><strong> </strong>that was joined by Commissioners Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro M. Bedoya.</p><p>Both items will appear in the Federal Register shortly. The final rule on government and business impersonation will become effective 30 days from the date it is published in the Federal Register. The public comment period for the SNPRM will be open for 60 days following the date it is published in the Federal Register, and instructions for how to comment will be included in the notice.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Google regularly launches updates to its algorithm to continuously improve search results quality. Think of these updates as a refresh of the system where rankings change: some websites see an improvement while others see a decline.</p>



<p>At HouseFresh, we keep an eye on Google’s news and documentation because these updates can literally make or break our website. That said, we don’t write for Google’s robots and always make editorial decisions with our readers in mind. </p>



<p>We know that at the end of the day, Google will reward us if our readers find our articles <a href="https://x.com/bettylo52207153/status/1746783622386892996?s=46" target="_blank">useful</a>.</p>

<p>Or that’s what we thought.</p>



<p>You might have noticed that no matter what you google, there’s always a selection of the same publishers showing up at the top of the results:</p>





<p>What do BuzzFeed, Rolling Stone, Forbes, Popular Science, and Better Homes &amp; Gardens have in common?&nbsp;</p>



<p>They all know which are the best air purifiers for pet hair:</p>

<p>Another thing they’ve got in common is that they all also seem to know the best cooling sheets for hot sleepers:<br></p>

<p>You could play this game yourself. Other searches you could try are: best gifts for mom, best home saunas, best beard products, best gifts for teens, best cocktail kits… the list goes on.</p>



<p>The problem is, for the most part, these publishers recommend products without firsthand testing and simply paraphrase marketing materials and Amazon listing information.</p>



<p>In the last year, we have waited patiently for the many, many, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/library/platforms/google/google-algorithm-updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MANY Google algorithm updates</a> to impact these results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were hopeful when Google introduced its reviews system with the Products Review Update <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2021/04/product-reviews-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2021</a>. It seemed they were finally doing something about one of the worst aspects of the modern internet: searching for information about products only to have to wade through countless reviews from people who had never even seen the thing.</p>



<p>Two years later, SEO professional Lily Ray <a href="https://twitter.com/lilyraynyc/status/1683589911063015424" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> that (big media) publishers were hit hard by Google’s Product Review updates, prompting a response from Google itself:</p>

<figure><a href="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/publishers-dont-want-to-test.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="821" height="910" src="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/publishers-dont-want-to-test.png" alt="" srcset="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/publishers-dont-want-to-test.png 821w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/publishers-dont-want-to-test-271x300.png 271w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/publishers-dont-want-to-test-768x851.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 821px) 100vw, 821px"></a></figure></div>






<p>In our experience, each rollout of the Products Review Update has shaken things up, generally benefitting sites and writers who actually dedicated time, effort, and money to test products <em>before</em> they would recommend them to the world.</p>



<p>That said, most searches for specific product models don’t just magically start with users searching for specific devices off the top of their heads. There is an immediate step before this: the hours of research reading through lists of product recommendations.</p>



<p>If you have been reading HouseFresh for a while, your first encounter with us was likely a list like <a href="https://housefresh.com/car-air-purifiers/">this one</a> or <a href="https://housefresh.com/air-purifiers-for-cooking-odors/">this one</a> recommending the best devices for a specific issue you were trying to solve. That is how most of our readers find us.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, we’re getting less and less traffic from those pages, and it’s endangering the future of our site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why we’re writing this article.</p>















<h2><span id="lwptoc1"><strong>Big media publishers are inundating the web with subpar product recommendations you can’t trust</strong></span></h2>



<h3><span id="lwptoc2"><strong>Uncovering the cookie-cutter system well-known magazines and newspapers use to trick Google&nbsp;</strong></span></h3>



<p>Savvy <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/do-i-need-seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEOs</a> at big media publishers (<a href="https://futurism.com/sports-illustrated-ai-generated-writers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or third-party vendors hired by them</a>) realized that they could create pages for ‘best of’ product recommendations without the need to invest any time or effort in actually testing and reviewing the products first.</p>



<p><strong>All they had to do was say what they needed to say to pass </strong><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/how-google-manual-reviews/356464/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>a manual check</strong></a><strong> if it came to that.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>So, they peppered their pages with references to a ‘rigorous testing process,’ their ‘lab team,’ subject matter experts ‘they collaborated with,’ and complicated methodologies that seem impressive at a cursory look.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes, they even added photos of ‘tests’ with products covered in Post-it notes, someone holding a tape measure, and people with very ‘scientific’ clipboards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s nothing wrong with wanting to show you’re doing the thing you’re supposed to be doing, but what happens when that’s as far as you go?</p>



<p>Let’s look at one example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are the current top 10 results on Google.com for a query we have completely given up on — <strong>Best Air Purifier for Pets</strong>:</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/best-air-purifiers-for-pets-top10.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="790" src="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/best-air-purifiers-for-pets-top10-1024x790.png" alt="" srcset="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/best-air-purifiers-for-pets-top10-1024x790.png 1024w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/best-air-purifiers-for-pets-top10-300x231.png 300w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/best-air-purifiers-for-pets-top10-768x593.png 768w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/best-air-purifiers-for-pets-top10.png 1418w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure></div>






<p>Right now, the magazine Better Homes &amp; Gardens is ranking at the top of the first page of results.</p>



<p>At a glance, the article shows all the right things:</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bhg-best-list-bs-EEAT-signals.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="874" height="1024" src="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bhg-best-list-bs-EEAT-signals-874x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bhg-best-list-bs-EEAT-signals-874x1024.png 874w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bhg-best-list-bs-EEAT-signals-256x300.png 256w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bhg-best-list-bs-EEAT-signals-768x900.png 768w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bhg-best-list-bs-EEAT-signals.png 1075w" sizes="(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px"></a></figure></div>






<p>If you were to keep scrolling, you’d also find photos of an air purifier inside of a tent, two more mentions of the expert Kenneth Mendez, and four mentions of their lab in Des Moines, Iowa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They say all the right things on the page and are a perfect example of a big media publisher with 40 different pages of ‘best of’ product recommendations in the house cleaning section alone without a single in-depth product review:</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bgh-best-of-pages.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="567" src="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bgh-best-of-pages-1024x567.png" alt="" srcset="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bgh-best-of-pages-1024x567.png 1024w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bgh-best-of-pages-300x166.png 300w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bgh-best-of-pages-768x425.png 768w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bgh-best-of-pages-1536x850.png 1536w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bgh-best-of-pages.png 1622w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure></div>






<p>They mention that they have tested 67 air purifiers in their lab in Des Moines, Iowa, but somehow, they have published zero product reviews and they don’t make their test data available anywhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They do have photos, with the majority of them being credited to Henry Wortock. Remember that name.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“But how do you know they didn’t test these devices?”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Better Homes &amp; Gardens never mentioned conducting tests prior to the Google Product Review Update in <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-releases-july-2022-product-reviews-update-386763" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 2022</a>. You can see clearly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220706122732/https://www.bhg.com/homekeeping/house-cleaning/cleaning-products-tools/best-air-purifiers-cleaner-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> how, on July 6th, there were no mentions of air purifiers being tested. Fast forward to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220726080113/https://www.bhg.com/homekeeping/house-cleaning/cleaning-products-tools/best-air-purifiers-cleaner-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 26th</a> (one day before the announcement of the Google update), and they’re now saying they’ve tested 38 air purifiers. Zero to over 30 devices in just a few weeks without any prior mention of any sort of testing. This is also the first time we see some original photos.</p>



<p>That’s not all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their air purifier recommendations are generally plagued by high-priced and underperforming units, Amazon bestsellers with dubious origins (that also underperform), and even subpar devices from companies that market their products with phrases like ‘the Tesla of air purifiers.’ Any actual product testing would show these air purifiers to be a bad pick. What you hardly ever see in their recommendations are truly affordable and high-performing options, which should be a priority if you’re <a href="https://housefresh.com/corsi-rosenthal-box-review/">trying to help people</a> clean the air in their homes.</p>



<p>For example, Better Homes &amp; Gardens recommends the Molekule Air Mini+ as their best option for small rooms:</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bhg-recommends-molekule.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="936" height="811" src="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bhg-recommends-molekule.png" alt="" srcset="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bhg-recommends-molekule.png 936w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bhg-recommends-molekule-300x260.png 300w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bhg-recommends-molekule-768x665.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"></a></figure></div>






<p>We have no idea how this device made the list considering that Molekule recently <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/10/05/air-purifier-company-files-for-bankruptcy-blames-san-franciscos-homeless-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed for bankruptcy</a>, has <a href="https://www.airpurifiersettlement.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">active class action lawsuits for false advertising</a>, has been recognized by Wirecutter as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/worst-air-purifier-we-ever-tested/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worst air purifier they tested</a>, and received the honor of being labeled as “not living up to the hype” by <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/appliances/air-purifiers/molekule-air-purifier-review-a6711172738/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Reports</a>.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://housefresh.com/molekule-mini-review/">we reviewed this device</a>, we also found it to be one of the worst air purifiers we have ever tested for multiple reasons:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>It took 3x as long to clear our test room of smoke compared to units sold for a third of its price</li>



<li>It’s incredibly noisy, generating 88 dB when running at its top fan speed — equivalent to a leaf blower, which people use while wearing hearing protection!</li>



<li>The filter replacement costs A LOT ($99.99), and you need to change it every six months, so you need to spend an additional $199.98 to use this air purifier for a year</li>



<li>It pulls 61 watts at its top speed, which might not seem like a lot but it is considering you could buy units for a third of the price that won’t consume more than 21 watts</li>
</ul>



<p>We could go on forever. But we can also show you actual firsthand data to back up each of our reasons not to recommend this air purifier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even some shallow desk research powered by Google would show that this product shouldn’t be recommended, but, hey, it’s $360, so it comes with a juicy commission compared to other better quality yet budget products.</p>



<p>But let’s go back to the search results for <strong>Best Air Purifier for Pets </strong>and give Google the chance to rank a truly reliable list of recommendations that live up to their guidelines.</p>



<p>Ranking below Better Homes &amp; Gardens, we have Real Simple, another magazine most people would immediately trust due to their longstanding brand.</p>



<p>When landing on Real Simple, the first thing you’ll notice is how similar the site looks to Better Homes &amp; Gardens. It uses the same template and has all the right signals to communicate that they test products for real:</p>

<p>Another interesting thing is that the photos on this page are credited to the same photographer, Henry Wortock (remember him?)</p>



<p>It even looks like the photos were taken in the same space:</p>

<p>Now, Real Simple doesn’t mention a lab in Des Moines, Iowa, but they do say they acquired 56 air purifiers to test AND they named the same expert: Kenneth Mendez.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly to Better Homes &amp; Gardens, there are no air purifier reviews on the entire site. That’s 56 devices that we just have to trust they actually tested and assessed.</p>



<p>Many of you won’t be surprised by all this because you’ll know that both companies are owned by the same media giant: Dotdash Meredith.</p>



<p>That’s probably why both sites have the same design and feature photos from the same freelance photographer (Henry Wortock). It’s also probably why they couldn’t really be bothered with sourcing another expert to satisfy that specific point in their E-E-A-T checklist (more on that later).</p>



<p>A deeper look inside Google Images shows how Dotdash Meredith is using photos clearly taken at the same time across different publications:</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/dotdash-photoshoot.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="733" height="1024" src="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/dotdash-photoshoot-733x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/dotdash-photoshoot-733x1024.png 733w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/dotdash-photoshoot-215x300.png 215w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/dotdash-photoshoot-768x1073.png 768w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/dotdash-photoshoot-1099x1536.png 1099w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/dotdash-photoshoot-1466x2048.png 1466w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/dotdash-photoshoot.png 1813w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px"></a></figure></div>






<p>Perhaps Dotdash Meredith did pay some lab to test all those devices across all those different websites, and it’s not just a collection of photoshoots their <a href="https://jobs.jobvite.com/dotdash/job/oyFhrfwF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commerce writers</a> can tap into when writing best-of lists.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, it’s clear the team at Dotdash Meredith has worked out what Google needs to see in order to rank best-of lists in top positions without the need to actually publish insightful product reviews or share any evidence of original test data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it’s not just Dotdash Meredith that we need to outrank if we want to recommend the actual best air purifiers for pets.</p>



<p>Let’s scroll down to position number six and see who’s ranking right below Amazon and Reddit:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello, BuzzFeed.</p>



<p>There’s a lot wrong with this list, starting with the fact that it includes a whopping 22 air purifiers and clearly hasn’t even been curated. Similarly to most big media publisher recommendations, BuzzFeed also lists the Molekule Air Mini+.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reading through the list, we found the BuzzFeed team doesn’t even pretend to test the air purifiers. There’s no firsthand research other than curating a list of devices and images from Amazon.com:</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BuzzFeed-Amazon-images.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="511" src="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BuzzFeed-Amazon-images-1024x511.png" alt="" srcset="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BuzzFeed-Amazon-images-1024x511.png 1024w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BuzzFeed-Amazon-images-300x150.png 300w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BuzzFeed-Amazon-images-768x383.png 768w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BuzzFeed-Amazon-images-1536x767.png 1536w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BuzzFeed-Amazon-images-2048x1023.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure></div>






<p>And then pulling in some reviews from Amazon.com as the bulk of their reasoning behind why they picked one air purifier over another:</p>

<p>Some of you might be shocked to see BuzzFeed recommending air purifiers, considering this is far from what BuzzFeed is all about. Others might rightfully think this list must be some sort of joke, expecting to see AI-generated images of air purifiers hugging and feeding cats and dogs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The truth is that BuzzFeed has been struggling to maintain the ranking of this particular page, so it will probably drop off the first page of Google results eventually:</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/buzzfeed-traffic-graph.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="355" src="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/buzzfeed-traffic-graph-1024x355.png" alt="" srcset="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/buzzfeed-traffic-graph-1024x355.png 1024w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/buzzfeed-traffic-graph-300x104.png 300w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/buzzfeed-traffic-graph-768x266.png 768w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/buzzfeed-traffic-graph-1536x532.png 1536w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/buzzfeed-traffic-graph.png 1588w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure></div>






<p><br>But until that day comes, searchers will continue to land on that Amazon.com copy-and-paste page when searching for an air purifier to help with pet odor and dander.</p>



<p>But hey, it’s BuzzFeed. They’re publicly listed and are the parent company of Huffington Post and Complex, so they <em>obviously </em>deserve to be there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right after BuzzFeed, we’ve got a Reddit thread that someone opened four months ago and has good discussions between Redditors:&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are also lots of spammy replies, with this specific one at the top right now for those landing on that page without being logged into Reddit:</p>

<p>Somehow the user has been banned from Reddit, but their comment is still at the top of the thread — we wonder how many other comments this user has published across different subreddits.</p>

<p>After their latest Helpful Content Update, Reddit <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-search-results-ai-spam-cf8c2605" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and LinkedIn</a> started ranking heavily in Google search results.

<h2><span id="lwptoc3"><strong>Private equity firms are utilizing public trust in long-standing publications to sell every product under the sun</strong></span></h2>



<h3><span id="lwptoc4"><strong>In a bid to replace falling ad revenue, publishing houses are selling their publications for parts to media groups that are quick to establish affiliate marketing deals</strong></span></h3>



<p>At position #8, we have Popular Science, a magazine from 1872 that was sold to a private equity firm, North Equity LLC, in 2020. A year later, North Equity <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/recurrent-ventures-named-the-new-parent-company-of-popular-science-the-drive-domino-field--stream-and-other-brands-301312885.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced Recurrent Ventures</a>, a new arm of their business that runs all the media brands they acquired. A few months later, PopSci switched to an <a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/science/popsci-spring-2021-digital-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all-digital format</a>. Two years later, in 2023, PopSci <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/27/23978042/popular-science-digital-magazine-discontinued" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stopped being a magazine</a> altogether.</p>



<p>Of course, most people won’t know that because the site still feels like the PopSci we all know and trust:</p>


<div>

<p>It doesn’t help that they have a ‘Why trust us’ section at the end of all their ‘Best of’ lists that says:</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PopSci-Why-Trust-Us-1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1304" height="680" src="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PopSci-Why-Trust-Us-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PopSci-Why-Trust-Us-1.png 1304w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PopSci-Why-Trust-Us-1-300x156.png 300w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PopSci-Why-Trust-Us-1-1024x534.png 1024w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PopSci-Why-Trust-Us-1-768x400.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1304px) 100vw, 1304px"></a></figure></div>






<p>The vast majority of readers don’t know that the teams behind these product recommendations are far from the team of journalists and editors who built the brand behind the site.</p>



<p>It’s unfortunate because many people will click on that Popular Science article expecting a trustworthy list of products only to find a list of units that haven’t even been tested by PopSci’s team:</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Pop-Sci-methodology.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1319" height="559" src="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Pop-Sci-methodology.png" alt="" srcset="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Pop-Sci-methodology.png 1319w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Pop-Sci-methodology-300x127.png 300w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Pop-Sci-methodology-1024x434.png 1024w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Pop-Sci-methodology-768x325.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1319px) 100vw, 1319px"></a></figure></div>






<p>After reading the article, it quickly becomes clear that every air purifier on the list was selected (and ranked) based on anecdotal experience.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/popsci-anecdotal-product-recommendations.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1172" height="1335" src="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/popsci-anecdotal-product-recommendations.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/popsci-anecdotal-product-recommendations.jpg 1172w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/popsci-anecdotal-product-recommendations-263x300.jpg 263w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/popsci-anecdotal-product-recommendations-899x1024.jpg 899w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/popsci-anecdotal-product-recommendations-768x875.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1172px) 100vw, 1172px"></a></figure></div>






<p>Another thing worth mentioning about this PopSci list of air purifiers is that it’s a completely new page on their site that went live on December 29th, 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This makes it all the more strange for them to be recommending not one but two (2!) Molekule air purifiers. Surely, the writer who researched each device ran into <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/news/2023/10/05/publicly-company-files-chapter-11-with-47m-debt.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the news of Molekule going bankrupt</a> — or the <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/10/05/air-purifier-company-files-for-bankruptcy-blames-san-franciscos-homeless-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ridiculous reasons</a> why they supposedly filed Chapter 11.</p>















<h2><span id="lwptoc5">Shouldn’t ‘best of’ lists be treated as product reviews?</span></h2>



<h3><span id="lwptoc6">Hint: yes, they should, but somehow they’re not&nbsp;</span></h3>



<p>In theory, ‘best of’ product recommendation lists should be treated the same as any product review.</p>



<p>Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/reviews-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation</a> clearly states that:</p>

<p>So, shouldn’t Google be rewarding ranked lists of recommendations “that provide insightful analysis and original research […] written by experts or enthusiasts who know the topic well”?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shouldn’t the reviews system ensure that people don’t end up landing on “thin content that simply summarizes a bunch of products, services, or other things”?</p>



<p>Perhaps we’re mistaken here, but we think the documentation says it plainly and clearly.</p>



<p>Sadly, these are just empty words because Google has a clear bias towards big media publishers.</p>



<p>Their <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/updates/core-updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Core</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/helpful-content-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helpful Content</a> updates are heavily focused on something they call E-E-A-T, which is an acronym that stands for Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SEO world has been obsessed with E-E-A-T <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/eat-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for a few years now</a>, to the point where <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=E-E-A-T%20seo&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is always someone on X</a> (formerly Twitter) discussing how to <em>show</em> experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness. Many of the examples come from <a href="https://riseatseven.com/blog/eeat-on-steroids-how-are-your-money-or-your-life-brands-doing-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dissecting big media publishers</a> like the ones we’ve been discussing in this article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason why SEOs look up to these sites is that Google rewards those sites:</p>


<div>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Interesting to see US News and Forbes benefit from this core update.</p><p>US News is earning top positions for its "cars" and "college" pages, sometimes even outranking the brand itself for its own branded KWs. <a href="https://t.co/qNkQy1HlT8" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/qNkQy1HlT8</a></p></div>— Lily Ray 😏 is on vacation 🌴🧘 (@lilyraynyc) <a href="https://twitter.com/lilyraynyc/status/1533840164539310080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 6, 2022</a></blockquote> 

</div>






<p>And people have been pointing this out for months:</p>


<div>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Genuine question – why are large sites like New York Magazine, CNN, Tom’s Guide, CNET, Forbes, and Business Insider not deemed unhelpful in the extreme when they write unrelated content purely targeting search engines.</p><p>Let me give you my logic.</p><p>Presumably Google ranks these…</p></div>— Sean Kaye (@SeanDoesLife) <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanDoesLife/status/1716935563075559630?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 24, 2023</a></blockquote> 

</div>






<p>Every single big media company (a.k.a. <a href="https://detailed.com/google-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Goliaths</a>) is currently pumping up their bottom line with affiliate earnings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The strategy of Recurrent Ventures for Popular Science seems to be to squeeze as much money as possible from this type of ranked list of recommendations before things start to go south.</p>



<p>You can see here how they have ramped up the pages inside of their ‘Gear’ section, which is where they house the bulk of their ‘best of’ articles — you can also see how their traffic has been declining since the latest Product Review update:</p>

<p>The strategy of Dotdash Meredith for their publications seems to be to optimize resources and maximize profit.</p>



<p>We might one day see the first page of Google results full of copycat recommendations once they roll out their hacks across all their websites, including Verywell, People.com, Health.com, Travel + Leisure, Byrdie, MyDomaine, The Spruce, Lifewire, Southern Living, TreeHugger, Parents.com… and so many other top tier publications.</p>



<p>Oh, wait, that’s already happening:</p>

<p>So, where do we go from here?</p>















<h2><span id="lwptoc8">Google is killing independent sites like ours through inaction</span></h2>



<h3><span id="lwptoc9">While this happens, investment firms and ‘innovative digital media companies’ are selling you bad products&nbsp;</span></h3>



<p>HouseFresh has published over 60 hands-on reviews that were written on the basis of multiple performance tests.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>We can tell you that testing and reviewing products takes a lot of time, money, and effort.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>But if our small team can publish real reviews, then these big publishers and private equity surely have the resources to do the same.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, right now, these companies are using all their resources to publish more and more pages peppered with the right ‘ingredients’ to dish up a tasty E-E-A-T meal for Google.</p>



<p>We have no doubt that these big publications could build their own labs, where they could run actual tests in order to make product recommendations backed by actual firsthand data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CNET bought an entire smart home <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/welcome-to-the-cnet-smart-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2015</a> in order to test products. That was before they were acquired by Red Ventures and found themselves selling the house after reporters told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/2/23582046/cnet-red-ventures-ai-seo-advertisers-changed-reviews-editorial-independence-affiliate-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a> they were feeling pressured to change their reviews to be more favorable to brands that were being advertised on CNET.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How many other ‘parent companies’ are using commerce or shopping editors to pass off promotional articles as editorial content?</p>



<p>It turns out that what we’re seeing now is a result of the brainchild of Alicia Navarro, the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-skimlinks-went-from-link-affiliation-being-worlds-alicia-navarro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skimlinks</a>, a content monetization platform for online publishers. Navarro wrote a series of <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2016/05/17/rise-commerce-editor-does-comtent-hold-key-monetisation-publishers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opinion</a> articles and provided quotes to industry publications, who started introducing the concept of ‘comtent’ in 2016:</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/comtent-ecommerce-editors.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/comtent-ecommerce-editors-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/comtent-ecommerce-editors-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/comtent-ecommerce-editors-300x169.jpg 300w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/comtent-ecommerce-editors-768x432.jpg 768w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/comtent-ecommerce-editors-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/comtent-ecommerce-editors-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure></div>






<p>Someone who voiced their discomfort with the idea of e-commerce editors publishing ‘comtent’ at the time was Brian Lam, founder of The Wirecutter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Months before being acquired by The New York Times, Lam <a href="https://digiday.com/media/newest-rainmaker-publishers-e-commerce-editors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that the Wirecutter had grown to become <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-01/how-a-small-tech-site-found-a-new-way-for-publishers-to-get-paid?leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most successful independent tech sites</a> by publishing 20 to 30 articles a month that would take 30 to 200 hours to research and produce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He said he didn’t believe in a role like that of an e-commerce editor who would be pushing products. “I believe in talented editors on a beat who help people find related gear, not someone specifically meant to find things to push to readers,” Lam added.</p>



<p>We are big fans of The Wirecutter, but we wonder whether their content would be as successful in the eyes of Google today if they were still an independent website. Luckily, they don’t need to worry about it because their site now sits inside the nytimes.com domain — a trusted and well-established media brand.</p>



<p>And it’s not just newer independent sites like HouseFresh that are losing traffic to big media publishers and their e-commerce editors.</p>



<p>Long-standing websites such as <a href="https://www.techgearlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GearLab</a> have also seen their traffic decline in recent months even though they publish product reviews based on objective, independent testing:</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/independent-site-traffic-loss.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="498" src="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/independent-site-traffic-loss-1024x498.png" alt="" srcset="https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/independent-site-traffic-loss-1024x498.png 1024w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/independent-site-traffic-loss-300x146.png 300w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/independent-site-traffic-loss-768x374.png 768w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/independent-site-traffic-loss-1536x748.png 1536w, https://housefresh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/independent-site-traffic-loss.png 1574w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure></div>






<p>We can’t speak for the GearLab team, but this situation just isn’t sustainable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many independent sites will go out of business if this trend continues.</p>











<h2><span id="lwptoc10">We hope to still be here to see things change</span></h2>



<h3><span id="lwptoc11">That’s the reason why we’re writing this article</span></h3>



<p>A few months ago, Futurism <a href="https://futurism.com/sports-illustrated-ai-generated-writers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uncovered</a> how Sports Illustrated was publishing ‘best of’ articles by fake, AI-generated writers. The magazine’s publisher, The Arena Group, washed their hands of it by stating that the “articles in question were product reviews and were licensed content from an external, third-party company, AdVon Commerce.”</p>



<p>We wonder how many of these big media companies and investment firms are hiring intermediaries to develop their ‘affiliate marketing’ arm, whatever the cost.</p>



<p>These Digital Goliaths are utilizing their websites’ authority and the public’s trust in their brands to sell every product under the sun.</p>



<p>They’re buying magazines we love, closing their print operations, turning them into digital-only, laying off the actual journalists who made us trust in their content in the first place, and hiring third-party companies to run the affiliate arm of their sites.</p>



<p>And while they do all this, they’re telling you to buy:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Products from brands that are bankrupt and have class action lawsuits for false advertising against them</li>



<li>Outdated, inefficient, and underpowered air purifiers that won’t actually clean the air in your home</li>



<li>Overpriced devices powered by fancy marketing tactics that will perform as well as units half the price</li>
</ul>



<p>We appreciate how much information Google has shared about <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/ecommerce/write-high-quality-reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what a high-quality review is</a> and about helpful content in general, but these guidelines need to be applied to everyone.</p>



<p>These Digital Goliaths shouldn’t be able to use product recommendations as their personal piggy bank, simply flying through Google updates off the back of ‘the right signals,’ an old domain, or the echo of a reputable brand that is no longer.</p>



<p>As a team that has dedicated the last few years to testing and reviewing air purifiers, it’s disheartening to see our independent site be outranked by big-name publications that haven’t even bothered to check if a company is bankrupt before telling millions of readers to buy their products.</p>



<p>That isn’t helpful content. Especially considering the work of air purifiers can’t be assessed by the naked eye.</p>



<p>Users won’t be able to tell if their air purifier is actually working without subject-matter knowledge and the help of tools to measure air quality. That’s when actual testing and firsthand data become indispensable.</p>



<p>If a magazine they trust tells them the <a href="https://housefresh.com/molekule-mini-review/" data-type="post" data-id="5606">Molekule Air Mini+</a>, the <a href="https://housefresh.com/puroair-hepa-14-240-review/" data-type="post" data-id="21327">PuroAir HEPA 14 240</a>, and the <a href="https://housefresh.com/okaysou-airmax-10l-pro/" data-type="post" data-id="14572">Okaysou AirMax 10L Pro</a> will help with their pet allergies, their asthma flare-ups, the air pollution that gets through the windows, the wildfire smoke blowing in their direction, the mold spores in their damp apartment, or recurring flu outbreaks in their school, then they’ll go and buy one of those useless, overpriced units.</p>



<p>Everybody loses but the investment firm.</p>



<p>We’re talking about only one product here, but we imagine the issues highlighted in this article are rampant across every consumer tech product being recommended by these big media sites.</p>



<p>Google won’t be the gatekeeper forever, but they are the gatekeeper now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ball is in their court.</p>

<h2>Over 14 years of todos recorded in text</h2>


<h3>By <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/">Jeff Huang</a>, updated on 2022-03-21</h3>

<p>
The biggest transition for me when I started college was learning to get organized. There was a point when I couldn't just remember everything in my head. And having to constantly keep track of things was distracting me from whatever task I was doing at the moment.
</p><p>
So I tried various forms of todo lists, task trackers, and productivity apps. They were all discouraging because the things to do kept getting longer, and there were too many interrelated things like past meeting notes, calendar appointments, idea lists, and lab notebooks, which were all on different systems.
</p><p>
I gave up and started just tracking in a single text file and have been using it as my main productivity system for 14 years now. It is so essential to my work now, and has surprisingly scaled with a growing set of responsibilities, that I wanted to share this system. It's been my secret weapon.
</p><p>
<b>Prerequisite</b>: A calendar. The one outside tool I use is an online calendar, and I put everything on this calendar, even things that aren't actually for a fixed time like "make a coffee table at the workshop" or "figure out how to recruit new PhD students" — I'll schedule them on a date when I want to think about it. That way all my future plans and schedule are together, and not a bunch of lists I have to keep track of.
</p><p>
<b>Making the Daily List</b>: Every night before I go to bed, I take all the items on my calendar for the next day and append it to the end of the text file as a daily todo list, so I know exactly what I'm doing when I wake up. This list contains scheduled tasks (2pm meeting with Madonna, 4pm office hours), errands (sign a form, return a book), and work items (review a paper, prepare a presentation). It also lets me think about whether I've got the right amount of work for a day.
</p><p>
Anything I don't want to do tomorrow, I'll shuffle back into my calendar on later dates. If the task is too big, I'll break it down into a piece for tomorrow, and the rest for another date. After years of doing this, I've gotten pretty good at estimating what I can finish in a day. Here's an example with names replaced so you can see what it looks like when I move a day's schedule from my calendar.
</p><p>
<code>2021-11-31
11am meet with Head TAs
- where are things at with inviting portfolio reviewers?
11:30am meet with student Enya (interested in research)

3:45pm advising meet with Oprah
4pm Rihanna talk (368 CIT)
5pm 1:1 with Beyonce #phdadvisee
6pm faculty interview dinner with Madonna
</code>
</p><p>
<b>As a Record</b>: That daily todo list is where I also take notes, so it's a <u>to do</u> list that turns into a <u>what done</u> list. The best thing about these daily lists is I keep them all in a single text file separated by dates, so I have a record of everything I have ever done and when I did it.
</p><p>
My current file was created 9 years ago when I started my current job. It serves as a research notebook, and as meeting minutes. I have 51,690 handwritten lines in one file now, documenting everything I have done as a professor, and nearly every person I have met with, along with notes about what we discussed or ideas I had. Here's what my list looks like at the end of the day, representing work accomplished.
</p><p>

- vote #HIRE

</code>
</p><p>
<b>Shortcuts and Features</b>: I use a consistent writing style so things are easily searchable, with a few shorthands. When I search for "meet with", it shows that I have had over 3,000 scheduled meetings. I have some tags like #idea for new ideas to revisit when I want project ideas, #annual for things to put on my next annual report, #nextui for things to add the next time I run my next UI course.
</p><p>
A text file is incredibly flexible, and at any point, I can quickly glance to see what I've done that day and what's left. I usually keep an empty line between tasks completed and upcoming tasks. When a task is completed, I move the empty line. Any leftover tasks from the current day can go back into the calendar for when I may want to tackle it again, but that is rare because tasks were already sized into what I can do on that day. I can calculate aggregate statistics using the search box, or list all the lines containing a tag, and other operations using my text editor. I use <a href="https://www.ultraedit.com/">Ultraedit</a> because I'm familiar with it, but any text editor would have similar capabilities.
</p><p>
<b>Email</b>: Email is obviously a part of my workflow. Everyone has all sorts of productivity advice about handling it, but I find a simple flagging system is sufficient — flag Red if it's something I need to deal with, flag Orange if I need to deal with it eventually but requires some thinking or someone else to handle it, and flag Yellow for emails I send that I am waiting on a reply for, so I know to follow up later. I'll flag emails as they come in, whenever it's convenient.
</p><p>
At the end of the day, I'll do a quick review of the Orange and Yellows to see if any need to be followed up or should become Red. Some peoples' workflows revolve around obsessively cleaning their Inbox. I don't really care about keeping my inbox empty because then I feel like I have new work to do whenever email comes in.
</p>
<p>So my <b>daily routine</b> looks like</p>
<ol><li>
look at the daily todo list I wrote last night to find out what I'm doing today
</li><li>
do scheduled things on that list during the day
</li><li>
when I have free (unscheduled) time, do the floating tasks on my list and work on Red-flagged emails
</li>
at the end of the day
<li>
do a quick review of Orange/Yellow emails to see if they need any handling
</li><li>
copy the next day's calendar items to the bottom of the text file
</li></ol>

<p>This process has a few <b>nice properties</b>:</p>
<ul><li>
It's easy to immediately see what to do when I wake up
</li><li>
I don't need to remember in my head the things to do later (following up on emails, future tasks)
</li><li>
It's easy to recall what happened in the past and see how much I can actually accomplish in a day
</li><li>
There's no running "todo" list with items that keep pushed back day after day
</li><li>
I use Remote Desktop so everything is accessible from every device
</li></ul>

<p>
My daily workload is completely under my control the night before; whenever I feel overwhelmed with my long-term commitments, I reduce it by aggressively unflagging emails, removing items from my calendar that I am no longer excited about doing, and reducing how much work I assign myself in the future.
</p><p>
It does mean sometimes I miss some questions or don't pursue an interesting research question, but helps me maintain a manageable workload.
</p><p>
So that's it. I would love to hear from you if you try my system, or have some ideas about it!
</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Erlang/OTP is different from most programming environments out there, even those that also use a virtual machine. Erlang has a strong opinion about how your applications should be structured, the level of isolation they should have, and a separation between what Erlang’s VM can do, and what your software can do. It’s not just a programming language, it’s a whole framework for building systems. Understanding its core principles is the key to getting started fast without having to rewrite everything later: it ensures that all applications can fit well together, that updates can be done live, and that your code is easy to instrument and make observable.</p><p>In this chapter, we’ll cover the Erlang virtual machine and the core concepts of OTP at the highest level.</p><h2 id="the-erlang-run-time-system">The Erlang Run-Time System</h2><p>The foundational block for everything is the Erlang virtual machine itself, called BEAM. BEAM is technically a single implementation of the Erlang virtual machine, as there could be others. For example, Erllvm is an implementation over LLVM (using some custom patches to make everything possible), and an older implementation in the 90s was called JAM. The Erlang VM is implemented in C, and contains a lot of fancy stuff: schedulers to run processes, garbage collection, memory allocators, a timer wheel for events, a bunch of smart switches to abstract over operating system features and provide unified interfaces (such as over time management, file-handling drivers, and so on), a few built-in functions that go faster than what Erlang can do on its own (BIFs) and an interface for functions implemented natively in other languages (NIFs) along with special schedulers for them. There’s obviously a lot more, but you can think of all that stuff the way you would with the kernel in BSD or Linux: low level stuff that you need in order to build fancier stuff.</p><p>If all you have is the virtual machine with nothing else, you can’t run Erlang code. You don’t have a standard library, you don’t have libraries to even load code. To get it all going, there’s some tricky bootstrapping going on that we don’t need to understand. Just know that there’s a limited set of pre-loaded Erlang modules that ship with the virtual machine, and those can be used to set up networking and file-handling stuff, which is in turn used to further load and run modules. If you’re interested in knowing more though, please consult <a href="https://happi.github.io/theBeamBook/">The BEAM Book</a> or <a href="http://beam-wisdoms.clau.se/en/latest/">BEAM Wisdoms</a>.</p><p>If you take the virtual machine and the pre-loaded stuff, along with all the little utilities that make code-loading possible, you have what is essentially called the <span>Erlang Run-Time System</span> (ERTS). The Run-Time System, when starting, follows the instructions of a thing called a <span>boot script</span> (which nobody writes by hand) that specifies what to start.</p><p>Erlang, by default, provides boot scripts that load a minimal amount of code required to start a shell and write your own applications. Once this is done, we can start thinking about Erlang, and not just the virtual machine.</p><h2 id="erlang-otp">Erlang/OTP</h2><p>What we have described so far is equivalent to an operating system’s kernel. We now need the foundational blocks for the userspace components. In Erlang, this is essentially what OTP is about. OTP specifies how “components” that run on the virtual machine should be structured. There’s more to the language than just “processes and messages”: there’s one well-defined way to structure your code.</p><div><p>note</p><p>OTP stands for _Open Telecom Platform_, which is literally a meaningless name that was used to get the stuff open-sourced back in the old days of Erlang at Ericsson.</p></div><p>Erlang/OTP systems are structured through components named <span>OTP Applications</span>. Every Erlang version you have installed or system built with it that you use ships with a few OTP Applications. There are basically two variants of OTP applications: <span>Library Applications</span>, which are just collections of modules, and <span>Runnable Applications</span>, which contain a collection of modules, but also specify a stateful process structure stored under a supervision tree. For the sake of clarity, we’re going to use the following terminology for OTP Applications for this entire book:</p><ul><li><span>Library Applications</span>: stateless collections of modules</li><li><span>Runnable Applications</span>: OTP applications that start stateful supervision tree structures with processes running in them</li><li><span>OTP Applications</span>: either <span>Library</span> or <span>Runnable Applications</span>, interchangeably</li></ul><p>By default, the two OTP applications everyone includes are called <code>stdlib</code>, which is a library application that contains the core standard library modules such as <code>list</code> or <code>maps</code>, and <code>kernel</code>, which is a runnable application and sets up the core structure for an Erlang system that relies on OTP applications to work.</p><p>When a node boots, the modules from all required OTP applications are loaded in memory. Then <code>kernel</code> is started. <code>kernel</code> manages the lifecycle of the system from this point on. All other OTP applications and their configuration are handled through it, and so are unique features like distribution and hot code updates. If we go back to the operating system comparison, you can think of the <code>kernel</code> OTP application a bit like you could think of <code>systemd</code> for the Linux kernel (or <code>init</code> if you hate <code>systemd</code> or use a BSD – Windows users can think of it as the service that runs other services)</p><p>In fact, <code>kernel</code> and <code>stdlib</code> are the only two applications you need for a basic working Erlang shell. When you type in <code>erl</code> (or start <code>werl</code> on Windows), this boots up the VM, along with kernel, with <code>stdlib</code> pre-loaded. Everything else is optional and can be loaded at a later time.</p><p>The standard Erlang distribution contains applications such as:</p><ul><li>kernel</li><li>stdlib</li><li>crypto (cryptographic primitives)</li><li>ssl (TLS termination library)</li><li>inets (network services such as FTP or HTTP clients)</li><li>ct (Common Test framework)</li><li>wx (graphic toolkit)</li><li>observer (a control panel to manage your Erlang node, building on <code>wx</code>)</li><li>compiler (the Erlang compiler to build your own project)</li><li>and so on</li></ul><p>All of these are put together into what is called an Erlang <span>release</span>. A release is a collection of OTP applications, possibly bundled together with a full copy of the virtual machine. As such, when you download and install Erlang, you just get a release whose name is something like <span>Erlang/OTP-21.3.4</span>. You’re free to build your own releases, which will take some of the OTP applications in the standard distribution, and then bundle them with some of your own apps.</p><p>So if we were to write an app named <code>proxy</code> that relies on <code>ssh</code> and <code>ssl</code> (which themselves depend on <code>public_key</code>, <code>crypto</code>, <code>stdlib</code>, and <code>kernel</code>), we would make a release with all of these components in it:</p><ul><li>ERTS</li><li>kernel</li><li>stdlib</li><li>crypto</li><li>public_key</li><li>ssl</li><li>ssh</li><li>proxy</li></ul><p>A visual representation of this can be seen in Figure <a href="#figure--fig:proxy-release">1</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://adoptingerlang.org/img/proxy_release_draft.png" alt="Figure 1: Visual representation of building the proxy release"><figcaption><p><span>Figure 1: </span>Visual representation of building the <code>proxy</code> release</p></figcaption></figure><p>Essentially, building an Erlang system is re-bundling the VM, along with some standard applications provided with the default distribution, together with your own apps and libraries.</p><h2 id="living-in-erlang-otp">Living in Erlang/OTP</h2><p>Standard tools developed and used by the community such as Rebar3 operate on the idea that what you write and publish are OTP applications, and as such contain all the functionality required to deal with them. That’s a big shift from a lot of programming languages that only ask of you to have a function named <code>main()</code> somewhere in one of your files. This is why the programming language is often called <code>Erlang/OTP</code> rather than just ‘Erlang’: it’s not just a programming language, it’s a general development framework that mandates some basic structure for everything you do.</p><p>And everyone follows it, whether they are writing embedded software, blockchain systems, or distributed databases. It’s OTP or nothing. Whereas other languages usually mandate nothing specific to get started, but then add some requirements later on (such as when integrating with a package manager), Erlang–and its entire community–expects you to just write OTP applications, which the rest of the tools can handle.</p><p>So the key to getting started fast in Erlang is to know the framework, which is often kept as more advanced material. Here we’re going to do things upside down and start from a fully functional release, and then dig down into its structure. The next chapters will be dedicated to understanding how to work within these requirements.</p></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><strong>Ubiquitously hip. That’s the best way to describe Citroën’s retro light commercial in 2017, a mammoth seven decades since it first appeared on French roads. </strong></p>
<p>A capable workhorse after the end of World War II, it wasn’t meant to be a cool commercial at all. But now, like its equally omnipresent Volkswagen Type 2 rival, it’s a vehicular landmark on streets all over Europe. And just like the VW, it is now most often seen with its side panel or rear doors open dispensing all manner of hot beverages or snacks to passing hipsters.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.adrianflux.co.uk/influx/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Citroe%CC%88n-Type-H-02.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.adrianflux.co.uk/influx/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Citroe%CC%88n-Type-H-02.jpg" alt="Citroen H Van rear"></a></figure>
<p>In production from 1947 to 1981, the Citroën Type H (also called the Type HZ and Type HY) was, functionally, a simple square box for carrying things. However, far from simple mechanically, the H Van was the most advanced light commercial of its period, and borrowed advances from its pioneering Traction Avant relative. The first mass-produced front-wheel drive commercial vehicle, a unitary monocoque body with no separate chassis frame, four-wheel independent suspension, and rack and pinion steering all translated into a beneficial language that spoke to technologically-minded business owners who placed innovative practicality above all else.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.adrianflux.co.uk/influx/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Citroe%CC%88n-Type-H-03.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.adrianflux.co.uk/influx/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Citroe%CC%88n-Type-H-03.jpg" alt="H Van interior"></a></figure>
<p>The French box-on-wheels enjoyed a flat floor, an 850-1,500kg payload (depending on version), a 6ft internal standing height, as well as a side loading door, a feature which would not be standard in the UK for decades. An innovative arrangement of three rear doors – one which lifted up like that of a hatchback car, with two suicide-hinged ones below – meant that goods could be loaded and unloaded under shelter.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.adrianflux.co.uk/influx/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Citroe%CC%88n-Type-H-04.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.adrianflux.co.uk/influx/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Citroe%CC%88n-Type-H-04.jpg" alt="H Van ad"></a></figure>
<p>The floor could take the weight of a horse, while enclosed van, pick-up and stripped-down body for coach-built derivative versions were available. Myriad wheelbase lengths were available, too, and with its wheels pushed out to its corners like the original Mini, the H Van boasted a relatively low centre of gravity for a commercial vehicle, which aided handling.</p>
<p>Not that you’d be going fast enough to experience the ultimate in roadholding. Even though the first H Vans were fitted with a large 1.9-litre petrol engine similar to those of the Traction Avant and DS, it was only bestowed with 35bhp and a top speed of 47mph.</p>
<p>A brace of 42bhp 1.6-litre and 50bhp 1.9-litre diesel engines appeared later, but were still far from powerful enough to dislodge the syrup which is now drizzled over the crepes now served from many an H Van. But whatever the engine flavour, the H Van’s recipe undoubtedly worked: 473,279 examples of Citroën’s corrugated commercial darling were made over an incredible 34-year period.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.adrianflux.co.uk/influx/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Citroe%CC%88n-Type-H-05.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.adrianflux.co.uk/influx/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Citroe%CC%88n-Type-H-05.jpg" alt="H van side"></a></figure>
<p>Of course, it’s that distinctive ribbed bodywork – borne of German ‘Junker’ aircraft and requiring uncomplicated low-cost pressing tools – and the pig-like snout which have elevated the Citroën Type H above other commercial vehicles. Now ever present in urban and festival landscapes, it has a retro look which endures seven decades after it first appealed to those delivery drivers, vendors, and animal-carrying famers of the 1950s.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.adrianflux.co.uk/influx/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Citroe%CC%88n-Type-H-06.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.adrianflux.co.uk/influx/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Citroe%CC%88n-Type-H-06.jpg" alt="Red H Van"></a></figure>
<p>A sure sign of a cult vehicle, the H van still inspires, too: <a href="http://en.typeh.eu/">FC Automobili</a> has launched a limited 70-set run of fibreglass kits to transform Citroën’s current Relay van into an €42,900 H Van tribute. With a total of six conversions and much more loadspace on offer, there may well be twice the body style choice of the original, but there’s certainly only a fraction of the distinctly French brutal elegance.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.adrianflux.co.uk/influx/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Citroe%CC%88n-Type-H-07a.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.adrianflux.co.uk/influx/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Citroe%CC%88n-Type-H-07a.jpg" alt="New H Van"></a></figure>
<p>But why has the boxy Citroën transcended time to become a bona-fide cult vehicle? While new-found retro appeal is one answer, adaptability is another. “The addition of crepe plates in a French van serving coffee made sense, and our summers have never been so busy!” say Mark and Sally from catering company <a href="http://www.vanchaud.co.uk/">Van Chaud</a>, who have operated a restored and converted food-vending 1969 H Van since 2012, bitten by the vintage Citroën bug after running a 2CV parts business.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.adrianflux.co.uk/influx/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Citroe%CC%88n-Type-H-08.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.adrianflux.co.uk/influx/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Citroe%CC%88n-Type-H-08.jpg" alt="H Van chaud"></a></figure>
<p><strong>There</strong><strong>’</strong><strong>s no doubt that very few commercial vehicles combine the style and long-lasting appeal of the Citro</strong><strong>ë</strong><strong>n Type H. And while its technology and make-up may no longer be cutting edge, it offers a crowd-pleasing allure and rugged beauty which has won it many fans. We raise a glass (or a plastic lidded coffee cup) to the Citro</strong><strong>ë</strong><strong>n Type H and wish it many happy returns. </strong><strong>‘</strong><strong>Bon Anniversaire</strong><strong>’ – </strong><strong>here</strong><strong>’</strong><strong>s to 70 years of Citro</strong><strong>ë</strong><strong>n’</strong><strong>s cult and cosmopolitan commercial!</strong></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>The <a title="JavaScript Set" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set">JavaScript <code>Set</code></a> was introduced to the language in the ES2015 spec, but it has always seemed incomplete. That's about to change.</p>

<p>Sets are collections of values where each value may only appear once. In the ES2015 version of the <code>Set</code>, the available functionality revolved around creating, adding to, removing from, and checking the membership of a <code>Set</code>. If you wanted to operate on or compare more than one set, you had to write your own functions. Thankfully, <a title="TC39" href="https://tc39.es/">TC39</a>—the committee established to work on the ECMAScript spec—and the browsers have been working on this. We are now seeing functions like <code>union</code>, <code>intersection</code> and <code>difference</code> in JavaScript implementations.</p>

<p>Before we look at the new functionality, let's recap what JavaScript Sets can do now and then we'll jump into the <a title="new Set functions" href="https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/union-intersection-difference-javascript-sets/#what-are-the-new-set-functions">new Set functions</a> and the <a title="JavaScript engines that support them" href="https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/union-intersection-difference-javascript-sets/#support">JavaScript engines that support them</a> below.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at what the ES2015 version of the JavaScript <code>Set</code> can do. It's easiest to do so with some examples.</p>

<p>You can <a title="construct a Set" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/Set">construct a <code>Set</code></a> without any arguments, which gives you an empty <code>Set</code>. Or, you can provide an iterable, like an array, to initialise the <code>Set</code>.</p>

<figure><pre><code>const languages = new Set(["JavaScript", "TypeScript", "HTML", "JavaScript"]);</code></pre></figure>
<p><code>Set</code>s can only contain unique values, so the <code>Set</code> above has three members. You can check this with the <a title="size property" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/size"><code>size</code> property</a>.</p>
<figure><pre><code>languages.size;

// =&gt; 3</code></pre></figure>
<p>You can add more elements to the <code>Set</code> with the <a title="add function" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/add"><code>add</code> function</a>. Adding an element that is already in the <code>Set</code> doesn't do anything.</p>
<figure><pre><code>languages.add("JavaScript");

languages.add("CSS");

languages.size;

// =&gt; 4</code></pre></figure>
<p>You can remove elements from the <code>Set</code> with <a title="delete" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/delete"><code>delete</code></a>.</p>
<figure><pre><code>languages.delete("TypeScript");

languages.size;

// =&gt; 3</code></pre></figure>
<p>You can check if an element is a member of the <code>Set</code> with the <a title="has function" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/has"><code>has</code> function</a>. One of the benefits of a <code>Set</code> is that this check can be done in constant time (<strong>O(1)</strong>), whereas the time to check if an element is in an <code>Array</code> varies by the length of the <code>Array</code> (<strong>O(n)</strong>). Using <code>Set</code>s for tasks like this is a <a title="clean way to write intentional efficient code" href="https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/what-is-clean-code/#example-4">clean way to write intentional efficient code</a>.</p>
<figure><pre><code>languages.has("JavaScript");

// =&gt; true

languages.has("TypeScript");

// =&gt; false</code></pre></figure>
<p>You can <a title="loop through a Set's elements using forEach" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/forEach">loop through a <code>Set</code>'s elements using <code>forEach</code></a> or a <code>for...of</code> loop. Elements are sorted in the order they were added to the <code>Set</code>.</p>
<figure><pre><code>languages.forEach(element =&gt; console.log(element));

// "JavaScript"

// "HTML"

// "CSS"</code></pre></figure>
<p>You can also get an iterator from the <code>Set</code> using the <a title="keys" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/keys"><code>keys</code></a> and <a title="values" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/values"><code>values</code></a> functions (<a title="which are actually equivalent" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/keys#using_keys">which are actually equivalent</a>) as well as the <a title="entries" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/entries"><code>entries</code></a> function.</p>

<p>Finally, you can empty a Set with the <a title="clear" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/clear"><code>clear</code></a> function.</p>
<figure><pre><code>languages.clear();

languages.size;

// =&gt; 0</code></pre></figure>
<p>That's a good reminder of what you can do with the ES2015 spec version of a <code>Set</code>:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>Set</code>s provide methods to deal with a collection of unique values</li>
  <li>It is efficient to add elements to a <code>Set</code> and to test for their presence in the <code>Set</code></li>
  <li>Converting an <code>Array</code> or other iterable to a <code>Set</code> is an easy way to filter out duplicates</li>

<p>This implementation misses out on operations between <code>Set</code>s, though. You might want to create a <code>Set</code> that contains all the items from two other <code>Set</code>s (a union of two <code>Set</code>s), find out what two <code>Set</code>s have in common (intersection), or find out what isn't present in one Set that is in another (difference). Until recently, you would have had to provide your own functions.</p>

<p>The <code>Set</code> methods proposal adds the following methods to <code>Set</code> instances: <code>union</code>, <code>intersection</code>, <code>difference</code>, <code>symmetricDifference</code>, <code>isSubsetOf</code>, <code>isSupersetOf</code>, and <code>isDisjointFrom</code>.</p>

<p>Some of these methods are akin to some SQL joins, which we will use to illustrate the results alongside the code. Let's see some examples of what each function does.</p>

<p>You can try out any of the code examples below in Chrome 122+ or Safari 17+.</p>

<p>A union of sets is a set that contains all the elements present in either set.</p>
<figure><pre><code>const frontEndLanguages = new Set(["JavaScript", "HTML", "CSS"]);

const backEndLanguages = new Set(["Python", "Java", "JavaScript"]);

const allLanguages = frontEndLanguages.union(backEndLanguages);

// =&gt; Set {"JavaScript", "HTML", "CSS", "Python", "Java"}</code></pre></figure>
<p>In this example, all the languages from the first two sets are in the third set. As with other methods that add elements to the <code>Set</code>, duplicates are removed.</p>

<p>This is the equivalent of a SQL <code>FULL OUTER JOIN</code> between two tables.</p>

<p>The difference between the set you are working with and another set is all the elements present in the first set and not present in the second set.</p>
<figure><pre><code>const frontEndLanguages = new Set(["JavaScript", "HTML", "CSS"]);

const backEndLanguages = new Set(["Python", "Java", "JavaScript"]);

const onlyFrontEnd = frontEndLanguages.difference(backEndLanguages);

// =&gt; Set {"HTML", "CSS"}&nbsp;

const onlyBackEnd = backEndLanguages.difference(frontEndLanguages);

// =&gt; Set {"Python", "Java"}</code></pre></figure>
<p>In finding the difference between sets, it matters which set you call the function on and which is the argument. In the example above, removing the back-end languages from the front-end languages results in "JavaScript" being removed and returning "HTML" and "CSS" in the resultant set. Whereas removing the front-end languages from the back-end languages still results in "JavaScript" being removed, and returns "Python" and "Java".</p>

<p>A difference is like performing a <code>LEFT JOIN</code>.</p>

<p>The symmetric difference between two sets is a set that contains all the elements that are in one of the two sets, but not both.</p>
<figure><pre><code>const frontEndLanguages = new Set(["JavaScript", "HTML", "CSS"]);

const backEndLanguages = new Set(["Python", "Java", "JavaScript"]);

const onlyFrontEnd = frontEndLanguages.symmetricDifference(backEndLanguages);

<p>In this case, the elements in the resultant sets are the same, but note that the order is different. Set order is determined by the order the elements are added to the set and the set on which the function is performed will have its elements added first.</p>

<p>A symmetric difference is like a FULL OUTER JOIN excluding any elements that are in both tables.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this means the proposal will graduate to stage 4 of the process, perhaps even in time to join the ES2024 spec before it is finalised.</p>

<p>While you need older JavaScript engine support, there are polyfills you can use to upgrade to spec-compliant implementations of these functions. They are available in <a title="core-js" href="https://github.com/zloirock/core-js#new-set-methods">core-js</a> or as individual packages per function in the <a title="es-shims project" href="https://github.com/es-shims">es-shims project</a> (for example, the <a title="set.prototype.union package" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/set.prototype.union">set.prototype.union package</a> can be used for union functionality).</p>

<p>If you've written your own implementation of any of these functions, I would recommend first upgrading to the polyfills, before phasing them out as the support becomes more widespread.</p>

<p>The JavaScript <code>Set</code> has long been incomplete but these 7 new functions round out the implementation nicely.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
						
					
			<p>A report by Chinese technology outlet, <a href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/7776705?from=edn_maintab_index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UDN</a>, suggests that AMD's Zen 5 CPUs will be entering TSMC fabs in Q2 followed by mass production in Q3 2024.</p>
<h2>AMD &amp; TSMC Prepping Up Production Facilities For Next-Gen Zen 5 CPUs Based on 4nm &amp; 3nm Nodes, Volume Production Reportedly In Q3 2024</h2>
<p>The Zen 5 CPU architecture is going to be a big deal for AMD in 2024 as it will power multiple lines of CPU families including Granite Ridge "Ryzen Desktop", Strix Point "Ryzen Mobile" &amp; Turin "EPYC Server". All of these CPU families will play a major role and it looks like these chips are entering the TSMC fabs for production next quarter followed by volume production in Q3 2024, as reported by UDN.</p>
<p>The outlet also specifically points out the AMD Zen 5 "<a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-2nm-zen-6-morpheus-3nm-zen-5-nirvana-core-architectures-for-future-epyc-cpus-leak-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nirvana</a>" CPU core which is the standard Zen 5 architecture design while the "<a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-to-utilize-samsung-4nm-tsmc-3nm-nodes-for-next-gen-chips-zen-5c-possibly-codenamed-prometheus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prometheus</a>" Zen 5C cores will aim the dense-compute segment in client and server chips. Interestingly, the Zen 5 "Nirvana" CCD is mentioned to be produced on the TSMC 3nm process node however we know from previous reports that Zen 5 will be using the 4nm node while Zen 5C will be made using the 3nm process.</p>
<p>It might be possible that UDN has confused the Zen 5C "Prometheus" core with Zen 5 "Nirvana". It was just last month when it was rumored that <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-next-gen-zen-5-granite-ridge-cpus-enter-mass-production-coming-to-am5-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD's Zen 5 "Granite Ridge" CPUs had already entered the mass production stage</a> though the company hasn't revealed anything about its next-gen desktop CPU plans at major events such as CES 2024. The only upcoming event that we can think of for an unveil would be Computex 2024 which will be held in June so that's still four months to go.</p>
<blockquote><p>As AMD is actively planning to launch new product lines, TSMC will also begin preparations for mass production of AMD's new products this year.&nbsp;The legal person pointed out that among the AMD Zen 5 architecture platform, the most critical core computing chip is manufactured by TSMC using the 3nm process. In addition, the HPC platform MI300 series has been put into mass production using TSMC’s 4nm and 5nm processes. The order momentum continues unabated, and TSMC’s advanced process order momentum from Advanced Micro Devices this year is very strong.</p>
<p>Industry analysis shows that the mass production of the 3nm process will take a relatively long time. It is estimated that AMD's new 3nm process Zen 5 architecture platform will enter the wafer mass production stage around the second quarter. By then, the production capacity is expected to increase month by month.</p>

<p>Not a whole lot about AMD's Zen 5 core architecture is known at the moment but from what the company has officially stated, it will offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced performance and efficiency</li>
<li>Re-pipelined front-end and wide issue</li>
<li>Integrated AI and Machine Learning optimizations</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we cannot confirm the legitimacy of UDN's report but they do have a strong record based on their previous industry stories and reports from their own insiders / industry analysts. Regardless of that, AMD's Zen 5 CPUs are something that everyone in the tech community should be excited for as they usher the next chapter of Ryzen and EPYC CPUs with stronger performance, efficiency and brand new features. Expect more information in the coming months.</p>

Most studies show that caffeine increases cognitive ability, memory and speed at performing intellectual tasks. </p><p>But there's 2 reasons the science doesn’t cut the mustard.</p><p><strong>First,</strong><span> lots of these studies ask participants to do constrained tasks (like pointless brainteasers) in a set time. </span></p><ul><li><p><span>This type of environment clearly doesn't account for the complexity of real life, where different tasks have to be prioritised, and </span><a href="https://zantafakari.substack.com/p/how-i-won-my-10-year-battle-with" rel="">procrastination is rife</a><span>. </span></p></li><li><p>Sure, if you told me I had to do 100 sums as fast as I could, caffeine would probably make me do them faster. But you clearly can't extrapolate that result easily.</p></li><li><p><span>Despite that, people make this illogical leap </span><em>all the fucking time.</em><span> They take “productivity” results in the narrow domain of doing a task in a scientific experiment, and assume it applies </span><em><span>to being productive in general. </span><strong>It does not.</strong></em></p></li></ul><p><strong>Second,</strong><span> these experiments suffer from the </span><a href="https://zantafakari.substack.com/p/5-the-perils-of-the-cohort-study" rel="">perils of the cohort study</a><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-141012714" href="https://zantafakari.substack.com/p/the-case-against-caffeine#footnote-6-141012714" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span><span>: they take the average outcome of </span><em>all</em><span> participants to determine whether the result of the experiment is positive or negative. </span></p><ul><li><p><span>But with biological variability, the average answer is </span><em>almost never</em><span> the answer for any single person. </span></p></li><li><p><span>This is a fundamental disservice to the individual, which led Nassim Taleb to coin the aphorism </span><strong>"Never cross a river that is </strong><em><strong>on average</strong></em><strong> 4 feet deep".</strong></p></li></ul><p><span>At this point, many of you might be thinking: </span><em>Zan, you sneaky weasel.

And I'm definitely not writing a scientific review. </p><p>What I'm sharing is the minority perspective. A perspective which may benefit more people than the standard narrative of caffeine consumption in our culture allows.</p><p>What I'm encouraging is for people to understand that we're all different. </p><p><em><strong>Like me</strong></em><span>, you might be relying on caffeine on the basis of false assumptions or group effects that don’t apply </span><em><strong>to</strong></em><span> </span><em><strong>you</strong></em><span>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Extreme Video Compression With Prediction Using Pre-trainded Diffusion Models</h2>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Prerequisites</h3>
<p dir="auto">Python 3.8 and conda, get <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/" rel="nofollow">Conda</a>
CUDA if want to use GPU
Environment</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="conda create -n $YOUR_PY38_ENV_NAME python=3.8
conda activate $YOUR_PY38_ENV_NAME
pip install -r requirements.txt"><pre><code>conda create -n $YOUR_PY38_ENV_NAME python=3.8
conda activate $YOUR_PY38_ENV_NAME
pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compress</h3>
<p dir="auto">For our project, the input is in the form of an array with a shape of (B, T,  C, H, W), where each frame in the array has a fixed size of 128x128. The number of frames in each video is 30, resulting in a shape of (B, 30, 3,128, 128). Before using this project, you may need to preprocess your video data accordingly.In the code, we provide an example array "city_bonn.npy" with a shape of (46, 30, 3, 128, 128). This array contains 46 videos from the city of Bonn in the Cityscape dataset. Below is an example command.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can control which videos to process by choosing the values for start_idx and end_idx. Ensure that the selected range does not exceed the value of B (the number of videos in your dataset).</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python city_sender.py --data_npy &quot;data_npy/city_bonn.npy&quot; --output_path &quot;your path&quot; --start_idx 0 --end_idx 1 "><pre><code>python city_sender.py --data_npy "data_npy/city_bonn.npy" --output_path "your path" --start_idx 0 --end_idx 1 
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Benchmark</h3>
<p dir="auto">In the Benchmark section, we provide code for computing compression metrics for H.264 and H.265. The input for this code should be 30 frames of 128x128 image frames, preferably named in the format "frame%d."</p>
<p dir="auto">the folder structure of dataset is like</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="/your path/
- frame0.png
- frame1.png
- ...
- frame29.png"><pre><code>/your path/
- frame0.png
- frame1.png
- ...
- frame29.png
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">For project_str, this is simply a string used to distinguish your data.Here we are using "uvg."</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python bench.py --dataset &quot;your path&quot; --output_path &quot;your path&quot; --project_str uvg"><pre><code>python bench.py --dataset "your path" --output_path "your path" --project_str uvg
</code></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Checkpoint</h2>
<p dir="auto">Regarding the checkpoints, we utilize two sets of them. One set includes "checkpoint_900000.pt," which is used for the video generation part. The other set contains six groups of checkpoints, and these checkpoints will be used for the image compression part, corresponding to six different compression qualities.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">checkpoints of image compression models</h3>
<p dir="auto">The six weights need to be moved to the "checkpoints/neural network" folder.</p>

              <p><strong>Email to all unaffected users:</strong></p>
<p>Wyze Friends,</p>
<p>On Friday morning, we had a service outage that led to a security incident. Your account and over 99.75% of all Wyze accounts were not affected by the security event, but we wanted to make you aware of the incident and let you know what we are doing to make sure it doesn’t happen again.</p>
<p>The outage originated from our partner AWS and took down Wyze devices for several hours early Friday morning. If you tried to view live cameras or Events during that time, you likely weren’t able to. We’re very sorry for the frustration and confusion this caused.</p>
<p>As we worked to bring cameras back online, we experienced a security issue. Some users reported seeing the wrong thumbnails and Event Videos in their Events tab. We immediately removed access to the Events tab and started an investigation.</p>
<p>We can now confirm that as cameras were coming back online, about 13,000 Wyze users received thumbnails from cameras that were not their own and 1,504 users tapped on them. Most taps enlarged the thumbnail, but in some cases an Event Video was able to be viewed. All affected users have been notified. Your account was not one of the accounts affected.</p>
<p>The incident was caused by a third-party caching client library that was recently integrated into our system. This client library received unprecedented load conditions caused by devices coming back online all at once. As a result of increased demand, it mixed up device ID and user ID mapping and connected some data to incorrect accounts.</p>
<p>To make sure this doesn’t happen again, we have added a new layer of verification before users are connected to Event Videos. We have also modified our system to bypass caching for checks on user-device relationships until we identify new client libraries that are thoroughly stress tested for extreme events like we experienced on Friday.</p>
<p>We know this is very disappointing news. It does not reflect our commitment to protect customers or mirror the other investments and actions we have taken in recent years to make security a top priority at Wyze. We built a security team, implemented multiple processes, created new dashboards, maintained a bug bounty program, and were undergoing multiple 3rd party audits and penetration testing when this event occurred.</p>
<p>We must do more and be better, and we will. We are so sorry for this incident and are dedicated to rebuilding your trust.</p>

              <p>I like that this time there was an email sent to everyone identifying all the different conditions/categories of people affected (or not). I see this as a step in the right direction and something that everyone was asking for to be done differently for any future issues, so it is good to see this now. Thank you for listening to our feedback requesting you do this in the future (I certainly [strongly] requested this in the past, so thanks), and deciding to implement it.</p>
<p>I also appreciate that you didn’t postpone sending this and didn’t decide to wait until normal business hours to send us your results (ie: Tuesday Morning). You told us you were doing a full investigation and would tell us the results <em>as soon as</em> you could give us the facts. I guess your “as soon as” was totally literal because you finished the investigation and even though it’s the middle of the night on a weekend night going into a holiday, you sent out the message now anyway because it was ready and felt you shouldn’t postpone it. That’s encouraging. There may be some people not happy about middle-of-the-night notifications, but I think it was the right call for something like this (besides, who doesn’t know how to use do-not-disturb, especially for something like emails while they sleep?).</p>
<p>While this was serious enough that working through the holiday weekend should be a given (especially for fixing things), I am still glad that you worked through the holiday weekend and late into the night and being thorough enough with the investigation that you identified every single account affected and every account that had a wrong thumbnail/event and every account that clicked on an event. The thoroughness is appreciated and letting me/us know which group/category each of my accounts fall under is appreciated so I am not just sitting around wondering.</p>
<p>(Edit update: Dave just stated the investigation isn’t over yet: “This investigation is not wrapped up yet, we will continue to discuss as a leadership team and evaluate what needs to change to better protect our users” which means you sent out this update after just the mid-analysis, without making us wait even longer. I’m not sure if this means that we’ll get another update or not toward the completion. There is more information I’d love to hear, but I am glad you didn’t make us wait longer for this information that was currently known and ready.)</p>
<p>I think bypassing cache for checks on user-device relationship is a good move for now considering cache issues have come up twice now, though in different ways. Yes, please do stress test the caching, preferably with a 3rd party contractor before using caching again.</p>
<p>I think the response this time was an improvement and increasingly transparent. Certainly more than most other companies who have leaked my information. A friend of mine recently shared with me this site: <a href="https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf">https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf</a> where there is a list of recent breaches of protected health care information constantly being hacked, stolen or leaked, with tens of thousands of victims constantly happening. It was a little terrifying how often our protected health and other information is constantly being hacked/stolen and we basically never even hear anything about it. I didn’t realize they were happening ALL THE TIME, like 10s of thousands multiple times per week and nobody even mentions it, and we get few to no details at all. I appreciate that this message proactively identified every affected user and let us know and even let those unaffected know. I for sure much prefer being notified than left in the dark (as being left in the dark seems to be standard).</p>

<p>What is the name of the caching library in question and what kind of bug would lead to a condition where a key would return a different value depending on load? Is this bug publicly documented?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>

              <p>I was wondering that also.</p>
<p>I know wyze recently started using Momento for caching of events and stuff:</p>

<p>But im not sure if they also use it for account stuff like that.</p>
<p>Definitely seems like a weird issue.  It makes sense that it could happen when pushing a code change, but I don’t see how that could happen due to high demand.  Unless Momentos system goes into a different state when in high demand (after AWS came back up all the queued tasks flooded the system) and the bug occurred in there.</p>
<p>Caching is very complicated though so anything’s possible lol.</p>
<p>I do appreciate the details we have been given and the email sent to everyone.  That’s more than most companies will do and shows that wyze is listening to our feedback.  Thank you.</p>

<p>I assume this is talking about new dashboards used exclusively by their security team for monitoring things, etc? And not referencing anything for us to use.</p>
<p>Though I would LOVE to have a fancy Wyze Dashboard (in the app or the web portal) that I could customize with all of my Wyze stuff on it! Maybe that needs to be a wishlist item! For now, I just imported most of my Wyze stuff into Home Assistant and make custom Wyze dashboards for myself there instead. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/facebook_messenger/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>I just received mine. It may take some time before emails are received by all. Emails were sent to every account, affected and unaffected. That must be millions of emails.</p>

              <p>Jason said on Reddit that they sent all the affected emails first, and the unaffected emails last and that those ones may take a lot of time to get out to everyone (Wyze has millions of users), so those affected should probably already have the email, and if you haven’t gotten one yet, you can probably pretty safely assume that you are not in the affected group and will be getting the email listed first up above.</p>
<p>I would say if you don’t have one with 24-48 hours then it could be worth asking for more info about how to tell if you were affected if you didn’t get an email.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">





<p>
The GCC 14 release series differs from previous GCC releases in
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-14/changes.html">a number of ways</a>. Some of these are a result
of bug fixing, and some old behaviors have been intentionally changed
to support new standards, or relaxed in standards-conforming ways to
facilitate compilation or run-time performance.
</p>

<p>
Some of these changes are user visible and can cause grief when
porting to GCC 14. This document is an effort to identify common issues
and provide solutions. Let us know if you have suggestions for improvements!
</p>

<h2 id="c">C language issues</h2>

<h3 id="warnings-as-errors">Certain warnings are now errors</h3>

<blockquote cite="https://archive.org/details/PC-Mag-1988-09-13/page/n115/mode/2up">
  Function prototyping was added, first to help enforce type checking
  on both the types of the arguments passed to the function, and also
  to check the assignment compatibility of the function return type.
  
</blockquote>

The initial ISO C standard and its 1999 revision removed support for
many C language features that were widely known as sources of
application bugs due to accidental misuse.  For backwards
compatibility, GCC 13 and earlier diagnosed use of
these features as warnings only.  Although these warnings have been
enabled by default for many releases, experience shows that these
warnings are easily ignored, resulting in difficult to diagnose bugs.
In GCC 14, these issues are now reported as errors, and no output file
is created, providing clearer feedback to programmers that something
is wrong.

<p>
Most components of the GNU project have already been fixed for
compatibility, but not all of them have had releases since fixes were
applied.  Programs that bundle parts
of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/">gnulib</a> or
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/">autoconf-archive</a>
may need to update these sources files from their upstream versions.

</p><p>
Several GNU/Linux distributions have shared patches from their porting
efforts on relevant upstream mailing lists and bug trackers, but of
course many programs that exhibit these historic C compatibility
issues are dormant today.

</p><h4 id="implicit-int">Implicit <code>int</code> types (<code>-Werror=implicit-int</code>)</h4>

In most cases, simply adding the missing <code>int</code> keyword
addresses the error.  For example, a flag variable like

<pre>  static initialized;
</pre>

becomes:

<pre>  static <ins>int</ins> initialized;
</pre>

<p>If the return type of a function is omitted, the correct type to
add can be <code>int</code> or <code>void</code>, depending on
whether the function returns a value or not.

</p><p>In some cases the previously implied <code>int</code> type was not
correct.  This mostly happens in old-style function definitions, when
argument types are not declared outside the parameter list.  Using the
correct type may be required to avoid int-conversion errors (see
below).  In the example below, the type of <code>s</code> should be
<code>const char *</code>, not <code>int</code>:

</p><pre>  write_string (fd, s)
  {
    write (1, s, strlen (s));
  }
</pre>

The corrected standard C source code might look like this (still
disregarding error handling and short writes):

<pre>  <ins>void</ins>
  write_string (<ins>int</ins> fd, <ins>const char *</ins>s)
  {
    write (1, s, strlen (s));
  }
</pre>

<h4 id="implicit-function-declaration">Implicit function declarations (<code>-Werror=implicit-function-declaration</code>)</h4>

It is no longer possible to call a function that has not been
declared.  In general, the solution is to include a header file with
an appropriate function prototype.  Note that GCC will perform further
type checks based on the function prototype, which can reveal further
type errors that require additional changes.

<p>
For well-known functions declared in standard headers, GCC provides
fix-it hints with the appropriate <code>#include</code> directives:

</p><pre>error: implicit declaration of function ‘strlen’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
    5 |   return strlen (s);
      |          ^~~~~~
note: include ‘&lt;string.h&gt;’ or provide a declaration of ‘strlen’
  +++ |+#include &lt;string.h&gt;
    1 |
</pre>

<p>
On GNU systems, headers described in standards (such as the C
standard, or POSIX) may require the definition of certain
macros at the start of the compilation before all required
function declarations are made available.
See <a href="https://sourceware.org/glibc/manual/html_node/Feature-Test-Macros.html">Feature Test Macros</a>
in the GNU C Library manual for details.

</p><p>
Some programs are built with <code>-std=c11</code> or
similar <code>-std</code> options that do not contain the
string <code>gnu</code>, but still use POSIX or other
extensions in standard C headers such as <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>.
The GNU C library automatically suppresses these extensions in
standard C mode, which can result in implicit function declarations.
To address this, the <code>-std=c11</code> option can be
dropped, <code>-std=gnu11</code> can be used instead,
or <code>-std=c11 -D_DEFAULT_SOURCE</code> can be used re-enable
common extensions.  Alternatively, projects using using Autoconf
could enable <code>AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS</code>.

</p><p>
If undeclared functions from the same project are called and there is
no suitable shared header file yet, you should add a declaration to a
header file that is included by both the callers and the source file
containing the function definition.  This ensures that GCC checks that
the prototype matches the function definition.  GCC can perform type
checks across translation units when building with options such as
<code>-flto -Werror=lto-type-mismatch</code>, which can help with
adding appropriate prototypes.

</p><p>
In some rare cases, adding a prototype may change ABI in inappropriate
ways.  In these situations, it is necessary to declare a function
without a prototype:

</p><pre>  void no_prototype ();
</pre>

However, this is an obsolete C feature that will change meaning in C23
(declaring a function with a prototype and accepting no arguments,
similar to C++).  Usually, a prototype with the default argument
promotions applied can be used instead.

<p>
When building library code on GNU systems,
<a href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.42/ld/Options.html#index---allow-shlib-undefined">it was possible to call
  undefined (not just undeclared) functions</a>
and still run other code in the library, particularly if ELF lazy binding
was used.  Only executing the undefined function call would result in a
lazy binding error and program crash.

</p><h4 id="missing-parameter-types">Typos in function prototypes (<code>-Werror=declaration-missing-parameter-type</code>)</h4>

Incorrectly spelled type names in function declarations are treated as
errors in more cases, under a
new <code>-Wdeclaration-missing-parameter-type</code> warning.  The
second line in the following example is now treated as an error
(previously this resulted in a warning not controlled by a specific
<code>-W…</code> option):

<pre>  typedef int *int_array;
  int first_element (intarray);
</pre>

The fix is to correct the spelling mistake:

<pre>  typedef int *int_array;
  int first_element (<ins>int_array</ins>);
</pre>

GCC will type-check function arguments after that, potentially
requiring further changes.  (Previously, the function declaration was
treated as not having a prototype.)

<h4 id="return-mismatch">Incorrect uses of the <code>return</code> statement (<code>-Werror=return-mismatch</code>)</h4>

GCC no longer accepts <code>return</code> statements with expressions
in functions which are declared to return <code>void</code>, or
<code>return</code> statements without expressions for functions
returning a non-<code>void</code> type.

<p>
To address this, remove the incorrect expression (or turn it into a
statement expression immediately prior to the <code>return</code>
statements if the expression has side effects), or add a dummy return
value, as appropriate.  If there is no suitable dummy return value,
further changes may be needed to implement appropriate error handling.

</p><p>
Previously, these mismatches were diagnosed as
a <code>-Wreturn-type</code> warning.  This warning still exists, and
is not treated as an error by default.  It now covers remaining
potential correctness issues, such as reaching the closing
brace <code>}</code> of function that does not
return <code>void</code>.

</p><p>
By default, GCC still accepts returning an expression of
type <code>void</code> from within a function that itself
returns <code>void</code>, as a GNU extension that matches
standard C++ rules in this area.

</p><h4 id="int-conversion">Using pointers as integers and vice versa (<code>-Werror=int-conversion</code>)</h4>

GCC no longer treats integer types and pointer types as equivalent in
assignments (including implied assignments of function arguments and
return values), and instead fails the compilation with a type error.

<p>
It makes sense to address missing <code>int</code> types, implicit
function declarations, and incorrect <code>return</code> statement
usage prior to tackling these <code>int</code>-conversion issues.
Some of them will be caused by missing types treated
as <code>int</code>, and the default <code>int</code> return type of
implicitly declared functions.

</p><p>To fix the remaining <code>int</code>-conversions issues, add casts
to an appropriate pointer or integer type.  On GNU systems, the
standard types
<code>intptr_t</code> and <code>uintptr_t</code> (defined
in <code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code>) are always large enough to store all
pointer values.  If you need a generic pointer type, consider
using <code>void *</code>.

</p><p>In some cases, it may be more appropriate to pass the
address of an integer variable instead of a cast of the variable's
value.

</p><h4 id="incompatible-pointer-types">Type checking on pointer types (<code>-Werror=incompatible-pointer-types</code>)</h4>

GCC no longer allows implicitly casting all pointer types to all other
pointer types.  This behavior is now restricted to the <code>void *</code>
type and its qualified variations.

<p>
To fix compilation errors resulting from that, you can add the
appropriate casts, and maybe consider using <code>void *</code>
in more places (particularly for old programs that predate the
introduction of <code>void *</code> into the C language).

</p><p>
Programs that do not carefully track pointer types are likely to
contain aliasing violations, so consider building
with <code>-fno-strict-aliasing</code>.  (Whether casts
are written manually or performed by GCC automatically does not make a
difference in terms of strict aliasing violations.)

</p><p>
A frequent source of incompatible function pointer types involves
callback functions that have more specific argument types (or less
specific return types) than the function pointer they are assigned to.
For example, old code which attempts to sort an array of strings might
look like this:

</p><pre>#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int
compare (char **a, char **b)
{
  return strcmp (*a, *b);
}

void
sort (char **array, size_t length)
{
  qsort (array, length, sizeof (*array), compare);
}
</pre>

To address this, the callback function should be defined with the
correct type, and the arguments should be cast as appropriate before
they are used (as calling a function through a function pointer of an
incorrect type is undefined):

<pre>int
compare (<ins>const void *a1</ins>, <ins>const void *b1</ins>)
{
  <ins>char *const *a = a1;</ins>
  <ins>char *const *b = b1;</ins>
  return strcmp (*a, *b);
}
</pre>

<p>
A similar issue can arise with object pointer types.  Consider a
function that is declared with an argument of type
<code>void **</code>, and you want to pass the address of a variable
of type <code>int *</code>:

</p><pre>extern int *pointer;
extern void operate (int command, void **);

operate (0, &amp;pointer);
</pre>

In these cases, it may be appropriate to make a copy of the pointer
with the correct <code>void *</code> type:

<pre>extern int *pointer;
extern void operate (int command, void **);

<ins>void *pointer1 = pointer;</ins>
operate (0, &amp;pointer<ins>1</ins>);
<ins>pointer = pointer1;</ins>
</pre>

As mentioned initially, adding the cast here would not eliminate any
strict aliasing violation in the implementation of
the <code>operate</code> function.  Of course in general, introducing
such additional copies may alter program behavior.

<p>
Some programming styles rely on implicit casts between related object
pointer types to implement C++-style <code>struct</code> inheritance.
It may be possible to avoid writing manual casts with
the <code>-fplan9-extensions</code> option and unnamed
initial <code>struct</code> fields for the base type in
derived <code>struct</code>s.

</p><p>
Some programs use a concrete function pointer type such as
<code>void (*) (void)</code> as a generic function pointer type
(similar to <code>void *</code> for object pointer types), and rely on
implicit casts to and from this type.  The reason for that is that C
does not offer a generic function pointer type, and standard C
disallows casts between function pointer types and object pointer
types.  On most targets, GCC supports implicit conversion
between <code>void *</code> and function pointer types.  However, for
a portable solution, the concrete function pointer type needs to be
used, together with explicit casts.

</p><h4 id="autoconf">Impact on Autoconf and build environment probing in general</h4>

Most <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">Autoconf</a>
probes that check for build system features are written in such a way
that they trigger a compiler error if a feature is missing.  The new
errors may cause GCC to fail compiling a probe when it worked before,
unrelated to the actual objective of the probe.  These failed probes
tend to disable program features together with their tests,
resulting in silently dropping features.

<p>
In cases where this is a concern, generated <code>config.log</code>,
<code>config.h</code> and other source code files can be compared
using <code>diff</code>, to ensure there are no unexpected
differences.

</p><p>
This phenomenon also impacts similar procedures that are part of CMake, Meson,
and various build tools for C extension modules of scripting
languages.

</p><p>
Autoconf has supported C99 compilers since at least version 2.69 in
its generic, core probes.  (Specific functionality probes may have
issues addressed in more recent versions.)  Versions before 2.69 may
have generic probes (for example for standard C support) that rely on
C features that were removed in C99 and thus fail with GCC 14.

</p><h4 id="errors-as-warnings">Turning errors back into warnings</h4>

<p>
Sources that cannot be ported to standard C can be compiled
with <code>-fpermissive</code>, <code>-std=gnu89</code>,
or <code>-std=c89</code>.  Despite their names, the latter two options
turn on support for pre-standard C constructs, too.  With the
<code>-fpermissive</code> option, programs can use C99 inlining
semantics and features that were removed from C99.  Alternatively,
individual errors can be downgraded to warnings using
the relevant <code>-Wno-error=…</code> option, or disabled completely
with <code>-Wno-…</code>.  For example,
<code>-Wno-error=incompatible-pointer-types</code> turns off most type
checking for pointer assignments.

</p><p>
Some build systems do not pass the <code>CFLAGS</code> variable to all
parts of the builds, and may require setting <code>CC</code> to
something like <code>gcc -fpermissive</code> instead.  If the build
system does not support whitespace in the <code>CC</code> variable, a
wrapper script like this may be required:

</p><pre>#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/bin/gcc -fpermissive "$@"
</pre>

<h4 id="c-code-generators">Accommodating C code generators</h4>

C code generators that cannot be updated to generate valid standard C
can emit
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Diagnostic-Pragmas.html"><code>#pragma GCC diagnostic warning</code></a>
directives to turn these errors back into warnings:

<pre>#if defined __GNUC__ &amp;&amp; __GNUC__ &gt;= 14
#pragma GCC diagnostic warning "-Wimplicit-function-declaration"
#pragma GCC diagnostic warning "-Wincompatible-pointer-types"
#pragma GCC diagnostic warning "-Wint-conversion"
#pragma GCC diagnostic warning "-Wreturn-mismatch"
#endif
</pre>

Not included here are <code>-Wimplicit-int</code>
and <code>-Wdeclaration-missing-parameter-type</code> because they
should be straightforward to address in a code generator.

<h4 id="warnings-as-errors-future-directions">Future directions</h4>

This section concerns potential future changes related to language
features from the C standard and other backwards compatibility
hazards.  These plans may change and are mentioned here only to give
guidance which source-level changes to prioritize for future
compatibility.

<p>
It is unclear at which point GCC can enable the C23 <code>bool</code>
keyword by default (making the <code>bool</code> type available
without including <code>#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;</code>).
Many programs define their own <code>bool</code> types, sometimes with
a different size than the built-in <code>_Bool</code> type.  A
further complication is that even if the sizes are the same, a custom
<code>bool</code> typically does not have trap representations,
while <code>_Bool</code> and the new <code>bool</code> type do.  This
means that there can be subtle compatibility issues, particularly when
processing untrusted, not necessarily well-formed input data.

</p><p>
GCC is unlikely to warn about function declarations that are not
prototypes by default.  This means that there is no stringent reason
to turn

</p><pre>void do_something ();
</pre>

into

<pre>void do_something (void);
</pre>

except for diagnosing extraneous ignored arguments as errors.  A
future version of GCC will likely warn about calls to functions
without a prototype which specify such extraneous arguments
(<code>do_something (1)</code>, for example).  Eventually, GCC will
diagnose such calls as errors because they are constraint violations
in C23.

<p>
GCC will probably continue to support old-style function definitions
even once C23 is used as the default language dialect.

</p><h2 id="cxx">C++ language issues</h2>


<p>Some C++ Standard Library headers have been changed to no longer include
other headers that were being used internally by the library.
As such, C++ programs that used standard library components without
including the right headers will no longer compile.
</p>
<p>
The following headers are used less widely in libstdc++ and may need to
be included explicitly when compiling with GCC 14:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code>
  (for <code>std::copy_n</code>, <code>std::find_if</code>,
  <code>std::lower_bound</code>,
  <code>std::remove</code>, <code>std::reverse</code>,
  <code>std::sort</code> etc.)
</li>
<li> <code>&lt;cstdint&gt;</code>
  (for <code>std::int8_t</code>, <code>std::int32_t</code> etc.)
</li>
</ul>

        To invoke htmz, you need a hyperlink (or form) having these attributes:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          href (or action) pointing to the
          <strong>resource URL</strong>
          <code><span>href</span>="<span>/flower.html</span>⋯</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Continuing within the href:
          <strong>destination ID selector</strong>
          <code>⋯<span>#my-element</span>"</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          And a <strong>target</strong> attribute with this value
          <code><span>target=<strong>htmz</strong></span></code>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <pre><code><!--
--><span>&lt;!-- Loads /flower.html onto #my-element --&gt;</span>
&lt;<span>a href</span>="<i>/flower.html</i><b>#my-element</b>" <span>target=<strong>htmz</strong></span>&gt;Flower&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;<!--
--></code></pre>
      <p>
        While this looks like an abuse of the URL fragment (it is), there is no
        other use for the URL fragment in this context, so it was repurposed as
        the destination ID selector. And it already looks like a CSS ID
        selector.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>⚠ Important note:</b> The loaded content
        <strong>replaces</strong> the selected destination. It may not be
        intuitive at first, but htmz does <em>not</em> insert the content into
        the destination. The rationale is that replacement is a more powerful
        operation. With replacement, you can <i>replace</i>,
        <i>delete</i> (replace with nothing), and <i>insert-into</i> (replace
        with the same container as original).

      <h2>What does it do exactly?</h2>
      <p>htmz does one thing and one thing only.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Enable you to load HTML resources within <em>any element</em> in the
          page.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Think tabbed UIs, dual-pane list-detail layouts, dialogs, in-place
        editors, and the like.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This idea is not new.</em> Dividing web pages into independently
        reloading parts has been a thing since mid-1990s. They were called
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/present/frames.html"><b>frames</b></a>, namely, &lt;iframe&gt;s, &lt;frame&gt;s, and &lt;frameset&gt;s.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>htmz is a generalisation of HTML frames.</strong> — Load
        HTML resources within <del>any frame</del> <ins>any element</ins> in the
        page.

      <h2>Advanced usage</h2>
      <p>
        Naturally, only <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> elements
        can target and invoke htmz (as of current HTML5). This is fine; it’s
        semantic, after all. However, HTML offers a couple more features that
        work well with htmz.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Per-button action &amp; target</h3>
        <p>
          If you want to override the form’s action on a per-button basis, use
          the
          <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>’s
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#formaction" target="_blank"><code>formaction</code></a>
          attribute.
        </p>
        <pre><code><!--
-->&lt;<span>form action</span>="<i>/default</i><b>#my-target</b>" <span>target</span><b>=<span>htmz</span>&gt;</b>
  &lt;<span>button</span>&gt;Default form action&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span>button formaction</span>="<i>/button</i><b>#my-target</b>"&gt;
    Different button action
  &lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span>button formaction</span>="<i>/another-action</i><b>#another-target</b>"&gt;
    Another action
  &lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span>form</span>&gt;<!--
--></code></pre>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Base target value</h3>
        <p>Tired of adding <code>target=htmz</code> to every link and form?</p>
        <p>
          Using the
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base" target="_blank">base</a>
          element, set htmz as the default target for all relative links. Add
          this at the top of your page.
        </p>
        <pre><code><!--
-->&lt;<span>base target</span><b>=<span>htmz</span>&gt;</b><!--
--></code></pre>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Clean target values</h3>
        <p>
          Don’t like the look of <code>target=htmz</code> at all? Prefer using
          the real target as the value?
        </p>
        <p>
          We can do a hack that enables you to write the target ID selector in
          the target attribute itself! Like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code><!--
--><span>&lt;!-- Loads /flower.html onto #my-element --&gt;</span>
&lt;<span>a href</span>="<i>/flower.html</i>" <span>target</span>="<b>#my-element</b>"&gt;Flower&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;<!--
--></code></pre>
        <p>
          The key is to add an iframe with a <em>matching name</em>, and modify
          the htmz snippet accordingly.
        </p>
        <pre><code><!--
-->&lt;<span>iframe hidden name</span>="<b>#my-element</b>" <span>onload</span>="htmz(<span>this</span>)"&gt;&lt;/<span>iframe</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;
  <span>function</span> htmz(frame) {
    document.<span>querySelector</span>(frame.name) <span>// use the iframe's name instead of the URL hash</span>
      ?.<span>replaceWith</span>(...frame.contentDocument.body.children);
  }
&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;
<!--
--></code></pre>
        <p>
          You can even
          <a href="https://github.com/Kalabasa/htmz/blob/master/examples/cf_clean_target_tabs/worker.js" target="_blank">automate the generation of matching target iframes</a>.

        <h3>Scripting / interactivity</h3>
        <p>
          If you need something more interactive than the request-response
          model, you may try the htmz companion scripting language:
          <b>javazcript</b>. Sorry, I meant JavaScript, a scripting language
          designed to make HTML interactive.
        </p>
        <p>
          htmz does not preclude you writing JS or using UI libraries to enhance
          interaction. You could, say, enhance a single form control with
          <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/" target="_blank">vanillaJS</a>, but
          the form
          <em>values</em>
          could still be submitted as a regular HTTP form with htmz.
        </p>
        <p>That said, htmz is extensible!</p>

      <h2><abbr title="Freemptively answered questions">FAQ</abbr></h2>

      <section>
        <h3 id="how">How does it work?</h3>
        <p>
          htmz is an iframe named "htmz". You invoke htmz by loading a
          URL into the iframe via target=htmz. By using an iframe, we lean on
          the browser’s native capability to fetch the URL and parse the HTML.
          After loading the HTML resource, we take the resulting DOM via an
          onload handler.
        </p>
        <p>htmz is essentially a <strong>proxy target</strong>.</p>
        <p>
          Like how a proxy server forwards requests to some specified server,
          proxy target htmz forwards responses into some specified target.
        </p>
        <pre><code><!--
--><span>&lt;!-- The ideal:
     GET /flower.html =&gt; #my-element            --&gt;</span>
&lt;<span>a href</span>="<i>/flower.html</i>" <span>target</span>="<b>#my-element</b>"&gt;Flower&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;

<span>&lt;!-- Actual:
     GET /flower.html =htmz&gt; #my-element        --&gt;</span>
&lt;<span>a href</span>="<i>/flower.html</i><b>#my-element</b>" <span>target</span>=<strong>htmz</strong>&gt;Flower&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;<!--
--></code></pre>
        <p>
          When you load a URL into the htmz iframe, the onload handler kicks in.
          It extracts your destination ID selector from the URL hash fragment
          and transplants the iframe’s contents (now containing the loaded HTML
          resource) into your specified destination.
        </p>
        <p>
          htmz only runs when you invoke it. It does not continually parse your
          DOM and scan it for special attributes or syntax, nor does it attach
          listeners in your DOM. It’s a proxy not a VPN.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>So it’s just another JavaScript framework?</h3>
        <p>Oh my! Not the f-word!!!</p>
        <p>
          On a more serious note, I would say that rather than a JS one, it’s
          more of an HTML micro-f*******k. It does use JS, but only the minimum
          necessary.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Is htmz a library or a framework?</h3>
        <p>htmz is a snippet. ✂️</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>What does htmz mean?</h3>
        <p>
          HTMZ stands for
          <i>
            <b>H</b>tml with <b>T</b>argeted <b>M</b>anipulation <b>Z</b>ones.
          </i>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Is this a joke?</h3>
        <p>
          This started as a
          <i>
            “Do I really need htmx? Can’t I do the load-link-into-target thing
            with current web? Sounds a lot like frames.”
          </i>
          and ended up with this.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, it isn’t quite a joke, but a response to htmx. I wanted to try
          htmx. The premise sounded great (<i>Why should you only be able to replace the entire screen?</i>), then I saw that it was 16kB of JavaScript. Huh. Then there’s
          special syntax everywhere. Huh. I don’t want to learn a whole new set
          of instructions and Turing-complete DSLs specific to those
          instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless of joke status, htmz seems fine as a library. It feels
          kinda powerful for its tiny size. (But really it’s the browser that’s
          doing the heavy lifting!) Nonetheless, there are limitations.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>What are the limitations?</h3>
        <p>
          The main direct limitation is having only one destination per
          response. However, this can be fixed by writing an extension. ;)
        </p>
        <p>
          A more general but classic limitation is the request-response model.
          The Web 1.0 model. This might mean putting more UI logic in the web
          server. This can be a good thing or a bad thing, as it can mean either
          consolidation or fragmentation of UI logic, which respectively
          decreases or increases complexity. It really depends on your goal and
          style.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="6H6ODGNZWRCLJF2DYXRQ6GXQ5I">GlobalFoundries would receive $3.1 billion in federal grants and loans to expand its Upstate New York computer chip plant and modernize a factory in Vermont, according to a preliminary deal the White House plans to announce today.</p><p id="5NLNOJKW7JHOLNS6OBIC5JDMSM">The massive package of subsidies would be the largest award to date to a manufacturer competing for aid from the $52 billion federal CHIPS and Science Act.</p><p id="OPKOMP7NSFEKBEXZRAQRPJGLGE">GlobalFoundries would receive $1.5 billion in grants and $1.6 billion in federal loans under a preliminary, non-binding agreement, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.</p><p id="T6SGBRWJAJEXHP5VRNGLJA7BGY">In return for the subsidies, GlobalFoundries said it would invest about $12.5 billion in the projects, most of which would be spent to expand the company’s Fab 8 in Malta, in Saratoga County.</p><p id="MPV5MGM355EDXBBTADT5IOBFSA">The big subsidies for GlobalFoundries offer a preview to the kind of announcement that President Joe Biden’s administration is <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/business/2024/01/micron-awaits-big-decision-on-how-much-feds-will-kick-in-for-100-billion-chip-plant.html" target="_blank">expected to make soon for Micron Technology</a>, which plans to build a much larger complex of computer chip plants in Central New York.</p><p id="CWXNVRVQ6BBCHAPJSSKBSEWZLA">The GlobalFoundries expansion would create up to 1,500 manufacturing jobs and 9,000 construction jobs over the next 10 years, federal officials said.</p><p id="Q7JBXQKIUJEZFBCIEF2JQQRIEA">Most of the new jobs would be created in Upstate New York, where GlobalFoundries is building a new plant to triple production capacity, said U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.</p><p id="GJFPE3HYEFFYXPXBLK3KQ7W2R4">The jobs would be on top of the 2,500 at the company’s existing plant in Malta, he said.</p><p id="Z4O2B2Y6URCNVNR6Z5FLFW5LQE">GlobalFoundries is one of only four companies in the world outside of China – and the only one in the United States – with the capacity to operate large-scale foundries that produce semiconductors used in both consumer and military applications.</p><p id="SQQ7VW7EOVEW3AHBBS26JOS6UU">The Saratoga County plant produces chips considered vital to national security, supplying more than 200 customers.</p><p id="WUK6FQE3YRA3HMGVLKWSNOVVOM">GlobalFoundries has signed a long-term deal to produce chips at its Upstate New York campus for Lockheed Martin, the nation’s largest defense contractor. The plant also has a long-term agreement to supply chips to General Motors for its cars and trucks.</p><p id="4OZOPNWI5JBUJHGRBN5BUU4CR4">“This is a huge day for not just Upstate New York and the Capital region and New York state, but for America as well,” Schumer said in a White House conference call with reporters. “By doing this, we will never have the kind of (chip) shortages we once had.”</p><p id="3TV242MIH5GA7FJVS3TU7VWRZA">U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the Saratoga County plant will make “high-value chips” that are currently not made in the United States.</p><p id="4IA6EF3UGZHLDAYSISN7QDQNGU">The 300-millimeter chips are essential for national security because U.S. defense companies and auto manufacturers have no other domestic sources, Raimondo said during the call with reporters.</p><p id="APIWEZY4WZCQJMHXLO3VZUSUJU">“I can’t emphasize how important this is,” she said. “As we all remember, very recently during the pandemic we faced a shortage of chips, which led to shutdowns and layoffs and furloughs of thousands of hard-working Americans in auto manufacturing sites all across the country.”</p><p id="Z3A4CTPNXRBANI4OSGLI3QE5UM">As part of today’s agreement, GlobalFoundries would receive a $10 million grant to expand a workforce development program in Saratoga County for manufacturing and construction workers, a Commerce Department official said.</p><p id="LD5RJUMM25ALZDO4ADHKMJMCG4">Schumer said the deal includes a commitment from GlobalFoundries to continue to provide a $1,000-per-employee annual subsidy for childcare and to extend the benefit to construction workers who build the new plant.</p><p id="2RVICDYPQZCRHAJ4MQJC2MEHLQ">The massive financial deal is a milestone in the CHIPS program that could provide clues as to how a deal would be structured between <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/topic/micron/" target="_blank">Micron Technology</a> and the federal government for a complex of chip plants in Central New York.</p><p id="WGZBZ7FMV5CDVGUSDLTJCHODP4">Micron <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/politics/cny/2023/08/micron-applies-for-federal-chips-act-aid-for-100-billion-central-new-york-project.html" target="_blank">applied to the U.S. Department of Commerce in August</a> for subsidies to support construction of up to four manufacturing plants at White Pine Commerce Park in the town of Clay.</p><p id="6SRSO5TELVGF7LR2D5MXPGKHQA">Micron said it would invest up to $100 billion in the plants over 20 years, creating up to 9,000 direct jobs and up to 40,000 more construction and spinoff jobs in other industries.</p><p id="6EKVMMRQMVEZFM5TCMXIKTAWR4">If GlobalFoundries receives a $1.5 billion federal grant for a roughly $12 billion investment, Micron might expect subsidies totaling at least $10 billion for its $100 billion project if the same percentages are applied.</p><p id="GYUQ2FV6PVH5FIUCIBMNNZCYRQ">Those subsidies are expected to come as federal grants, loans and loan guarantees.</p><p id="SNI53QWMOJBHDIMTT5EMGBEIWM">Other big semiconductor companies could be in line for similar financial incentive packages.</p><p id="F3DFE4FYUVB6DKOIIKLUB42VEM">Intel, which plans to invest up to $100 billion in an Ohio project similar to Micron’s in Central New York, is negotiating with federal officials on a deal for $10 billion in loans and grants, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-16/intel-in-talks-for-more-than-10-billion-in-chips-act-incentives?sref=cd8Qmg5A" target="_blank">Bloomberg reported Friday</a>, citing sources it did not identify.</p><p id="Y5US3OZRYNFAPIKEQO57HLZVHA">Separately, the Treasury Department is in the process of establishing rules for the companies to apply for a 25% investment tax credit. The tax credit would apply to construction and equipment costs.</p><p id="MJK6LALYYRDHNPRME73II4WV6U">Under the CHIPS and Science Act authored by Schumer, the Senate majority leader, the limit for grants is $3 billion per project.</p><p id="ENNNDIU6PFC67MSYFGPIEV2JDY">But those limits could be waived by President Biden if officials determine the project is essential for national security.</p><p id="VK2ILS2LLVFP3GG6NWXTDMXPQQ">Micron and Commerce Department officials have declined to discuss the status of secret negotiations over the company’s application.</p><p id="VZ36OFDO35EQZJDC34TFWGYELQ"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-expects-make-chips-funding-awards-coming-eight-weeks-raimondo-2024-02-05/" target="_blank">Raimondo said earlier this month</a> that she expects her department to announce several large CHIPS grant awards over the next six to eight weeks.</p><p id="J7IP2MDVONDG5JJCWAE2H4JYNU">The grants for GlobalFoundries would come from a separate <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/strategic-importance-legacy-chips" target="_blank">$2 billion fund in the CHIPS Act set aside for legacy chips</a>, older generation computer chips used in large quantities in autos, airplanes, home appliances and other consumer electronics.</p><p id="BPQU6PG5CBC5NINV6X5MUL6SJI">Micron makes leading-edge or cutting-edge memory chips that are more sophisticated and used in smartphones, data centers, quantum computing and artificial intelligence applications.</p><p id="O4HQGYETORALBORECV5NHYK4RQ">The CHIPS and Science Act set aside $39 billion in subsidies for leading-edge chip subsidies.</p><p id="2DMXDNV7KVCRFO2J4DZXU4FTRE">Other leading-edge chip makers include Intel, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. – all of which have committed to building new plants in the United States.</p><p id="YDDXCVOVDZEWLHKMC2YTKGLSSA">All told, the Commerce Department says it is negotiating with about 160 large companies who have applied for grants and loans. An additional 600 companies have submitted statements of interest in CHIPS funding.</p><p id="R7OWB6BLXVBYTECQC2QNHGPFRI">Schumer said he wrote the CHIPS and Science Act with the idea of transforming Upstate New York into a global hub for semiconductor manufacturing, research and development. A series of chips projects are underway in the Thruway corridor stretching from Albany to Buffalo.</p><p id="FRSY5JETEVBKVE3C6JPLZONDVE">Some industry officials have complained about the slow pace of the negotiations for federal subsidies.</p><p id="PP3NJBCR2VBMFL3E2I2RMSYOBQ">Until today, only two companies had struck preliminary deals for smaller amounts of CHIPS Act money. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/11/business/economy/biden-chips-bae-systems.html" target="_blank">BAE Systems would receive up to $35 million in incentives </a>to modernize its plant in New Hampshire.</p><p id="6RX67EISYRBV5CINVZZXEY4WEA">Separately, <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2024/01/microchip-wins-72-million-federal-chips-act-grant-oregons-first-for-gresham-expansion.html" target="_blank">Microchip Technology Inc. agreed to a deal for about $162 million</a> in subsidies to support expansions of plants in Colorado and Oregon.</p><p id="I463NHWHBZGTJGQEHV3LWPLQMU">Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/intel-delays-20-billion-ohio-project-citing-slow-chip-market-713bde9e" target="_blank">Intel said it would delay construction</a> on the $20 billion chip manufacturing plant it started to build near Columbus, Ohio.</p><p id="XJBF4K4265CVFJYFH775Y75XPQ">Intel blamed the decision on slowing demand for its chips and delays in securing federal grants from the CHIPS Act. The company is building the first two of its four planned chip plants near Columbus.</p><section><ul data-testid="list"><li><a href="https://www.syracuse.com/opinion/2024/02/granting-tax-breaks-for-all-housing-is-irresponsible-public-stewardship-your-letters.html">Granting tax breaks for all housing is irresponsible public stewardship (Your Letters)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.syracuse.com/business/2024/02/proposal-to-expand-tax-breaks-for-new-housing-in-onondaga-county-receives-pushback.html">Proposal to expand tax breaks for new housing in Onondaga County receives pushback</a></li><li><a href="https://www.syracuse.com/business/2024/02/micron-offering-paid-summer-internships-for-central-ny-college-students.html">Micron offering paid summer internships for Central NY college students</a></li><li><a href="https://www.syracuse.com/business/2024/01/cost-to-build-sewer-line-in-clay-more-than-doubles-and-its-not-because-of-micron.html"> Cost to build sewer line in Clay more than doubles – and it’s not because of Micron</a></li><li><a href="https://www.syracuse.com/opinion/2024/01/chinas-open-source-chips-threaten-us-semiconductor-push-guest-opinion-by-david-paterson.html">China’s open-source chips threaten US semiconductor push (Guest Opinion by David Paterson)</a></li></ul></section><p id="METHAQZJYZGOBFBRJ6KKIZUTB4"><i>Got a tip, comment or story idea?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p><strong>Disclaimer: This article covers Firefox v89, and there are some improvements today.</strong></p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/89.0/releasenotes/" rel="nofollow">release of Firefox v89</a> in 2021, there was a tremendous amount of controversy(<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/npdb3p/firefox_890_release_proton_ui_lets_help_each/" rel="nofollow">reddit</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27353684" rel="nofollow">HN</a>) over the UI, and this repository quickly gained popularity for addressing most of the issues.<br>
<a href="https://www.waterfox.net/" rel="nofollow">Waterfox</a> and <a href="https://floorp.app/" rel="nofollow">Floorp</a> browsers also set my theme as the default.</p>
<p>Between writing <a href="https://github.com/black7375/Firefox-UI-Fix/wiki/%5BArticle%5D-0.-Firefox-UI-UX-history">that last post</a> and hesitating to write it, time has passed, it's 2023, and Mozilla has decided to <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2023/07/06/firefox-support-for-windows-7-8-and-8-1/" rel="nofollow">end support for Windows 7 and Windows 8</a>.
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/115.0/system-requirements/" rel="nofollow">Firefox v115</a> is the last version to support legacy Windows and will be available <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-users-windows-7-8-and-81-moving-extended-support#firefox:linux:fx122" rel="nofollow">until September 2024</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, mozilla has cleaned up a lot of legacy code, and this project also required me to do a lot of work and remove features related legacy Windows.
So it seems like a good time to write this post.</p>
<p>Since this article also covers UI on legacy windows, I don't think it should put it off any longer than that.</p>
<p>What was better than the Proton UI in version 89?<br>
Let's dive right in.</p>
<h2>Principles</h2>
<p>For me, there are 3 big and 16 small criteria for UI/UX design.<br>
I don't have the data or the environment to do A/B testing, so I have no choice but to predict user behavior, which is very important.<br>
I had to think deductively, using various theories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitiveness: Be easy to understand and use.
<ul>
<li>Simplicity: Remove unnecessary things or make it simple to reduce cognitive burdens.</li>
<li>Visibility: Key features are visible for ease of operation.</li>
<li>Accustomably: Reduce the amount of learning to adapt quickly.</li>
<li>Consistency: Reduce the exception for easier remembrance.</li>
<li>Predictability: Reducing anxiety by making you think it's controllable.</li>
<li>Affordance: Provides clues how to manipulate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Efficiency: The goal should be achieved quickly and accurately.
<ul>
<li>Clearly: The distinction shuold be well-recognized.</li>
<li>Proximal: Close enough to move quickly.</li>
<li>Bulky: Large size is easy to recognize or move.</li>
<li>Snappy: Smooth and no janky for responsive</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flexibility: Accepting requirements and minimizing mistakes
<ul>
<li>Accessibility: Accommodate a wide range regardless of age, disability, etc.</li>
<li>Functional: Accommodate a wide range of features to meet needs.</li>
<li>Contextual: Exist naturally in each situation.</li>
<li>Harmonious: Exist naturally in each elements.</li>
<li>Pleasure: Pursue satisfaction for fun or creatively.</li>
<li>Compatibility: consider lower version APIs, higher version roadmaps, upstream or OS, RTL, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>I'd write down what the problem was that made me start this project and made people uncomfortable.</p>

<p>When I tried the developer edition of version 89, I was in for a big shock.<br>
This is because, despite the neat first impression, it was just too uncomfortable.</p>
<p>There were three main issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tab: Tabs that look like buttons</li>
<li>Padding: It's too big</li>
<li>Icons: It's hard to read on its own</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<h3>Why Tab(Accustomably, Affordance)</h3>
<h4>Accustomably</h4>
<p>Often referred to as <a href="https://lawsofux.com/jakobs-law/" rel="nofollow">Jakob’s Law</a>, when they encounter a new app, they expect it to behave the same way as the traditional UX they already know.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25581533/292626388-082e321b-1f5c-41f9-9f05-cecbeaa45beb.png" alt="Other Browsers Tab">
</p>
<p>Certainly, Firefox's new tab UI seems like a difficult adjustment.<br>
But saying that you shouldn't change your UI simply because you're not used to it can stifle progress and lead to decisions that only follow trends.<br>
You can be a fast follower, but you have to be careful because it stifles innovation.</p>
<h4>Affordance</h4>
<p>Okay, so it makes sense to provide another rationale.</p>
<p>I can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology" rel="nofollow">Gestalt psychology</a> to describe the problem.</p>
<p>

<h4>Case Studies: Apple Safari</h4>
<p>Apple has announced at WWDC that macOS 12 Monterey is getting an all new Safari browser.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25581533/292630910-6ec6dd07-857c-451c-8a55-b7dea8508e64.png" alt="New Safari UI">
</p>
<p>However, after many complaints from users, Apple came up with a compromise in Beta3 tabs that look like buttons.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/14/macos-monterey-safari-redesign/" rel="nofollow">macOS Monterey Beta 3: Apple Redesigns Safari Tab Interface Following Complaints</a></li>

</ul>
<p>

</p>
<p>But it still failed, and Apple eventually declared a complete rollback to classic tabs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/27/apple-releases-safari-15-1-macos-big-sur-catalina/" rel="nofollow">Apple Releases Safari 15.1 for macOS Big Sur and macOS Catalina</a></li>

</p>
<p>Apple isn't necessarily right, but the <strong>"button-like tab"</strong> can be criticized, given that it's not easy to roll back to the beginning many times.</p>
<h3>Why is too much space bad? (Visibility, Proximal, Bulky, Contextual)</h3>
<h4>Visibility</h4>
<p>The first is intuitively understandable.<br>
The web browser is a web content viewer and should not interfere with showing content.</p>
<p>But Proton UI is losing out due to a lot of padding.<br>
This is fatal on devices with small screens, such as 13-inch laptops.</p>

<h4>Proximal &amp; Bulky</h4>
<p>There is a logical way to explain this.<br>
It's <a href="https://lawsofux.com/fittss-law/" rel="nofollow">Fitts's Law</a>.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25581533/292635837-304b7e23-0fb1-4774-b88f-c850db8e0a13.png" alt="Fitts’s Law">
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law" rel="nofollow">Fitts's Law</a> predicts that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target.<br>
The formula and explanation for Fitts's Law is as follows:</p>
<p><math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="080c9ba51392f75a3caa653870454759">$$\begin{eqnarray}

</ul>
<p><math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="080c9ba51392f75a3caa653870454759">$a$</math-renderer> and <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="080c9ba51392f75a3caa653870454759">$b$</math-renderer> are constants, so they don't matter.<br>
In other words, <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="080c9ba51392f75a3caa653870454759">$ID$</math-renderer> is what matters, and the <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="080c9ba51392f75a3caa653870454759">$\log_{2}$</math-renderer> can be omitted, as can the constants.</p>
<p>The ratio of <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="080c9ba51392f75a3caa653870454759">$\frac{2D}{W}$</math-renderer> that is left over is important here.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="080c9ba51392f75a3caa653870454759">$2:1$</math-renderer>, so reducing the distance is the first step</li>
<li>Maximize the width, but not the distance</li>
<li>Fill in the extra space, to prevent padding from getting too large</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let's compare which UI is easier to click.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25581533/292637069-0368aba6-6836-4a7b-86a3-2b15ebc70b05.png" alt="Proton padding">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25581533/292637072-c089afcd-26d7-406b-bbe3-df586e614bd4.png" alt="Photon padding">
</p>
<p>As you might expect, <code>Photon(v88)</code> is easier to press.</p>
<ol>
<li>The <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="080c9ba51392f75a3caa653870454759">$W$</math-renderer> in the <code>Amazon</code> icon is larger</li>
<li>The <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="080c9ba51392f75a3caa653870454759">$W$</math-renderer> in the menu is a little smaller, but the <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="080c9ba51392f75a3caa653870454759">$D$</math-renderer> is much smaller.</li>
</ol>
<p>Especially for the <code>Amazon</code> icon, the loss makes the clickable area look smaller than it actually is.<br>
It's a good idea to fill in the padding area to make the icon look bigger.</p>
<h4>Contextual</h4>
<p>In this situation, Mozilla <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/compact-mode-workaround-firefox" rel="nofollow">deprecated the compact UI</a>.</p>
<p>But there was something even worse..<br>
Try to spot the difference in the following screenshot.</p>

<p>That's a little hard, isn't it?
The answer is that the tab bar and toolbar are slightly different heights.</p>
<p>In v89, these were <code>Compact UI</code>, <code>Normal UI</code>, and <code>Touch UI</code>, respectively. Indeed!!!<br>
The difference between each UI was almost meaningless.</p>
<h4>Case Studies: Google Chrome</h4>
<p>It's also interesting to compare this to the UI spacing in the most popular browser, Chrome.</p>

<h2>Redesign Tabs</h2>
<p>There's more to creating tabs than just how they look.<br>
Here we'll take a look at some of the <code>Lepton Theme</code> tab design choices.</p>
<h3>Tab states</h3>
<ul>
<li>Simplicity, Consistency, Predictability, Affordance, Clearly, Functional, Harmonious, Compatibility</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the states of the tabs you know?</p>
<ol>
<li>Selected</li>
<li>Multiple Selected</li>
<li>Hover (Mouse up)</li>
<li>Text overflow</li>
<li>Tab overflow (Tab scroll mode)</li>
<li>Reaching tab resizing</li>
<li>Sound &amp; Muted</li>
<li>Autoplay Block</li>
<li>PIP(Picture In Pictuure)</li>
<li>Pinned</li>
<li>Container</li>
<li>No favicon</li>
<li>Changed title</li>
<li>Loading</li>
<li>Unloaded</li>
<li>Crashed</li>
<li>Shared</li>
<li>Theme</li>
<li>UI Density</li>
<li>...ETC</li>
</ol>
<p>All of this needs to be <strong>presented consistently</strong> within <code>36px</code> to <code>240px</code>.<br>
This seems like a complicated problem.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at some common mistakes in the Proton UI.</p>
<p>Which tab is the selected tab?</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25581533/292642217-8092d3f4-d33b-47b5-b1e6-f71a87bce387.png" alt="What is selecte?">
</p>
<p>The correct answer is to the left.<br>
The first(<code>Photon</code>) and third(<code>Lepton</code>) are easy to recognize because they are connected to the toolbar.<br>
To reduce visual overload, Lepton shortens the container indicator's in the background tab to make them shorter.</p>
<p>But secondly(<code>Proton</code>), it's hard to tell which tab is selected between the highlighted background color and the bar at the top.<br>
The top bar is the container tab indicator, which feels similar to the selected tabs in predecessor UI, <code>Photon</code>.</p>
<p>But what about when it's <code>Selected</code>, <code>Multiple selected</code>, <code>Hovered</code>, or <code>General</code>?</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25581533/292642607-70c1600f-172f-40b3-b3d7-e2237a0e7c60.png" alt="Other selected states">
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<code>Photon</code>:
<ul>
<li>Connected with a toolbar to recognize <code>Selected</code>
</li>
<li>Easily distinguish between <code>Multiple selected</code> and <code>Hovered</code> with the color of the top context line</li>
<li>
<code>Multiple selected</code>'s background color is distinct from <code>Selected</code>, and <code>Hovered</code>'s background color is closer to <code>General</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<code>Proton</code>:
<ul>
<li>
<code>Selected</code> and <code>Multiple selected</code> look almost exactly the same</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<code>Lepton</code>:

</li>
<li>They all have different background colors to distinguish them</li>

<h3>Utilizing space</h3>
<p><code>Lepton</code> also has a smart and efficient behavior based on the width of the tab.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25581533/292645331-5ffe61ce-e8c5-49e5-abc8-46ad90387a07.png" alt="Full width">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25581533/292645354-61e95b09-20eb-49a7-ad38-3422ac46dea1.png" alt="Width reaches end">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25581533/292645401-ce4804af-4368-4d20-8658-026513cc2849.png" alt="Width reaches end with hover">
</p>
<ol>
<li>Like <code>Proton</code>, it shows all the close buttons when there is enough width.</li>
<li>If the tab reaches the end and runs out of width, similarly hide the close button on the background tab.<br>
The size of the close button has been reduced to reduce accidental clicks.</li>
<li>You can still close it by hovering over the background tab.</li>
</ol>
<p>Adjust the padding and gradient so that the tab titles are also effectively visible.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25581533/292646141-c562986d-fcdc-4225-b8aa-7041354e99cf.png" alt="Effective width">

</p>
<ol>
<li>
<code>Lepton</code> sees the <code>New</code> text on the last. By using an optical illusion to save space.</li>
<li>
<code>Lepton</code> is a wiki with the words clearly visible. (Adjust only when width is insufficient)</li>
<li>
<code>Lepton</code> shows more of web contents</li>
<li>
<code>Photon</code> and <code>Lepton</code> have tab separators</li>
</ol>
<h3>Distributions</h3>
<p>There are certain criteria for what constitutes a good UI for each person, but it's also a matter of "taste" to some extent.</p>
<p>The following are all good examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lepton with common tabs to match Proton</li>
<li>Photon tabs with context lines at right angles</li>
<li>Original proton tabs</li>
</ol>
<p>So I've picked three cases to match the concept of distributions.</p>

<h3>More cases</h3>

<ol>
<li>Menus and panels will definitely shrink in size.<br>

<li>The global menu also have icons.</li>
<li>Add icons to the menu of each bookmark library folder and responds when it is opened.</li>
<li>Add icons for different case layouts.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Theme</h2>
<h3>System default theme</h3>
<p>Lepton provides a UI that adapts to different OS and their settings.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25581533/292660579-0c83b0b3-1786-4fbf-b85b-93a629ca50d8.png" alt="Each os">
</p>
<ol>
<li>Windows 7: Follow the aero window design closely</li>
<li>Windows 8.1: Just like Windows7, I've made sure that the title board blends in nicely.</li>
<li>Windows 10 Light: I followed Windows 10's <code>Legacy Edge</code> colors to make it look the best for Windows 10.</li>
<li>Windows 10 Dark: Same as above</li>
<li>Windows 10 Dark + Accent titlebar: Windows 10 has a titlebar accent color setting. If it is enabled, you should follow it.</li>
<li>MacOS Light: On a Mac, it should follow the color of the Mac.</li>
<li>MacOS Dark: Same as above</li>
</ol>
<p>If you're using Windows 11, you can use the <code>userChrome.compatibility.os.win11</code> option to use Windows 11 colors similar to Edge.</p>
<p>It works well on Linux, of course, and fixes color issues and non-native titlebar button issues.</p>
<p>

<h3>Improvement proton theme</h3>

  <p>More darkmode</p>

<p>Finally, I've made sure that the colors apply well if you're using a custom theme rather than the default theme.<br>
It would be great if you could infuse enough of your personality into the products you use.</p>

<h4>Animations</h4>
<p>Animations make the UI feel smoother and more natural.<br>
But sometimes it also makes the behavior feel <strong>"slow"</strong>.</p>
<p>Therefore, I designed it like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Follow the <a href="https://firefoxux.github.io/photon/motion/duration-and-easing.html" rel="nofollow">easing curve of photon</a>, accelerating rapidly at the beginning and decelerating smoothly at the end</li>
<li>Follow the above principle and shorten the duration of the starting animation to make it feel like it's reacting <strong>"fast"</strong>.</li>
<li>Follow the above principle and lengthen the duration of the exit animation to make it feel like a <strong>"soft"</strong>.</li>
<li>Larger objects have a longer duration than small</li>
<li>The duration inside the nested object should also be long</li>
</ol>
<p>The limitations of the GIF format make it look choppy, but it's actually smoother</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This theme takes into account customs, psychology, and research findings and inherits the best of the existing themes.<br>
It also supports OS, dark mode, custom themes and interactions to suit your situation.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some things we can't do due to the limitations of CSS, like <a href="https://github.com/black7375/Firefox-UI-Fix/wiki/%5BArticle%5D-0.-Firefox-UI-UX-history#explanation-4">page action button behavior</a>.</p>
<p>Now, you should have a better idea of the goal of my theme:<br>
<strong>"🦊 I respect proton UI and aim to improve it."</strong></p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Some fractals -- for instance those associated with the Mandelbrot and quadratic Julia sets -- are computed by iterating a function, and identifying the boundary between hyperparameters for which the resulting series diverges or remains bounded. Neural network training similarly involves iterating an update function (e.g. repeated steps of gradient descent), can result in convergent or divergent behavior, and can be extremely sensitive to small changes in hyperparameters. Motivated by these similarities, we experimentally examine the boundary between neural network hyperparameters that lead to stable and divergent training. We find that this boundary is fractal over more than ten decades of scale in all tested configurations.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article" role="article">
      <p>I used to be a big fan of Spotify. I was such a fan that I went to extraordinary lengths to get access to it while I lived in Tunisia, years before I was technically allowed to use it there.</p>
<p><img alt="" decoding="async" height="382" src="https://blog.raed.dev/images/spotify/spotify_1.png.jpg" width="1287" fetchpriority="high" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.raed.dev/images/spotify/spotify_1.png.jpg 1287w, https://blog.raed.dev/images/spotify/spotify_1@987w.jpeg 987w, https://blog.raed.dev/images/spotify/spotify_1@687w.jpeg 687w"></p>
<p>I liked the early desktop application; it felt like a better iTunes. Without the hassle of piracy.</p>
<p><img alt="" decoding="async" height="546" src="https://blog.raed.dev/images/spotify/spotify_3.png.jpg" width="998" fetchpriority="high" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.raed.dev/images/spotify/spotify_3.png.jpg 998w, https://blog.raed.dev/images/spotify/spotify_3@698w.jpeg 698w"></p>
<h3 id="side-note">Side note</h3>
<p>Growing up in Tunisia, piracy was the norm. Our debit cards didn’t work internationally, and publishing companies never thought of us as a viable market to bother with. Access to any form of culture was exclusively done through eMule, LimeWire, torrents, and MEGA. It was a pain, but the alternative was to pay someone in the gray market to do it for you. And you just bought pirated movies, albums, games, etc.</p>
<p>That changed for me when I was able to open Spotify, click on a track, and it just worked.<br> Spotify was so convenient that it made up for the hoops I needed to jump through just to get access to it.</p>
<p>The convenience of having almost any music you could think of, the seamless blending of my local MP3s and the Spotify catalog, and the added bonus of discovering new tracks were all worth the hassle for the teenage me.
I had to set up VPNs, create multiple accounts for free trials, download shady patched builds… And it was all worth it.</p>
<p>In 2015, I moved to Europe, and with my VISA card in hand, I finally was able to subscribe to Spotify Premium.</p>
<p>No more hoops. I could finally use Spotify in a legit way and, more importantly, help support the artists I like.</p>
<p>I then started using the mobile app. It made me forget about my old iPod Nano. Then there was a redesign, another, pricing changes, introduction of podcasts, and now audiobooks?</p>
<h2 id="falling-out-of-love-with-spotify">Falling out of love with Spotify</h2>
<p>Today, I dread opening the Spotify app. The main screen is littered with podcasts I don’t care about, nor have I ever listened to. It keeps pushing playlists that feel generic, bland, more based on demographics than my years of consistent listening history. And there is nothing I can do about it.</p>
<p><img alt="" decoding="async" height="611" src="https://blog.raed.dev/images/spotify/spotify_2.png.webp" width="1600" fetchpriority="high" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.raed.dev/images/spotify/spotify_2.png.webp 1600w, https://blog.raed.dev/images/spotify/spotify_2@1300w.webp 1300w, https://blog.raed.dev/images/spotify/spotify_2@1000w.webp 1000w, https://blog.raed.dev/images/spotify/spotify_2@700w.webp 700w"></p>
<p>The main screen on Spotify is not user-customizable. There is no way for me to signal that I truly, really don’t care about that podcast and I haven’t cared about it once since you have been pushing it for the last 18 months!</p>
<p>Today, I have to scroll for a long time before finding anything remotely interesting on the Spotify main page. The alternative is plain old search and playing on repeat the same dozen curated playlists.</p>
<p>The lack of customization feels like a slap. Like Spotify designers telling me “you don’t know what you want, we know better,” but the problem is they don’t, and they haven’t for a long time.</p>

<p>I used to cherish music, I used to religiously collect, catalog and enjoy every album on my iPod. I could navigate the endless folders and find that exact song that I needed for that precise moment.</p>
<p>Spotify killed that, I listen to what it suggests and just accept that it will go away when it decides to rotate it out. Spotify trained me not to look too hard, to let the flow be, and if that awesome song is gone or removed, don’t worry, we still have a million more.</p>

<p>Spotify really doesn’t want to be limited to music; they want all of your audio.
When Spotify announced their walled-garden podcast platform, they explained that they needed to break away from the open podcasting standards because they were building features so innovative that it would be impossible to port back to RSS and independent players.</p>
<p>Years later and Spotify has only introduced some feedback forms that were used (and quickly dropped) by a couple of podcasts. The walled-garden stayed though. And the dark patterns they keep using to boost the numbers have only pushed me away.</p>
<p>Oh, and yes, the podcasts now have ads, even when you pay for Premium. That is some great innovation.</p>

<p>I might have been naive, but when I started paying for Spotify Premium, I thought my money was going to the artists that I was listening to. Turns out I’m too stupid to understand how this complex mechanics of deals and pools and what they dubbed the “Streaming Economy”. <a href="https://allthisistrue.substack.com/p/your-spotify-wrapped-and-instafests">Your Spotify Wrapped and InstaFests Suck, and Here’s Why</a></p>
<p>I thought that if, for a month, I listened to one artist, then Spotify would take a cut, but then all my monthly subscription would go to them.</p>
<p>Instead, my subscription is probably pooled according to some black box formula and ends up paid to some of their top performers like Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, or The Weeknd. While the indie artist I have been obsessed with gets literally nothing because they don’t meet a certain arbitrary threshold.</p>
<p>Today I realized that I don’t find joy in Spotify anymore. I’m no longer that teen that wanted to show everyone this amazing music app on his bulky laptop.
Today I exported my data, I canceled my subscription, and I mourn the app that Spotify was and could have been.</p>

      <p>Roughly two miles deep in the Pacific Ocean, on a dark and rocky outcrop near Costa Rica nicknamed El Dorado Hill, scientists from the Schmidt Ocean Institute observed the miracle of life—pinkish octopus hatchlings emerging from their warm, potato-shaped eggs.</p>

<p>These babies were the centerpiece of a two-part discovery <a href="https://schmidtocean.org/scientists-discover-four-new-species-of-deep-sea-octopus/">announced</a>&nbsp;earlier this month: Biologists found four new species of octopus, which have not yet been formally described, and examined an underwater ecosystem of hydrothermal vents, offering clues as to where more deep ocean species may be living.</p>

<p>“It was unexpected to find so many species of octopus in a small area, first, and second, at 3,000 meters depth,” <a href="https://schmidtocean.org/person/jorge-cortes-nunez-2">Jorge Cortés-Núñez</a>, a researcher at the University of Costa Rica and co-chief scientist with the Schmidt Ocean Institute, tells <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfAZWxiOT3Q">DW News</a>.</p>

<p>One part of the discovery came last June, when researchers <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-find-rare-deep-sea-octopus-nurseries-180982477/">spotted the rare hatchery</a> for the first time. Using a remotely operated vehicle named SuBastian, they identified two hydrothermal springs, two octopus nurseries and one <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-walking-fish-can-teach-us-about-human-evolution-180968111/">skate</a> nursery in the area. The second expedition, which occurred in December, verified for the team that these octopus nurseries seem to be active year-round.</p>

<p>Curled up on the black seafloor, defensively wrapped in their tentacles and facing sucker-side out, the cephalopod mothers had chosen this location strategically. Octopuses do not eat while brooding their eggs—a process that can sometimes <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/octopus-mom-waits-record-4-years-for-eggs-to-hatch-1.2722807">take years</a> in the cold, deep ocean. But by brooding near the region’s vast array of hydrothermal vents, which discharge water at <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S096706371730256X#:~:text=Benthic%20octopods%20cluster%20on%20bare,108%20%CE%BCM).">around 54 degrees Fahrenheit</a>, they seem to <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-hot-springs-draw-the-worlds-largest-gathering-of-deep-sea-octopuses-180982803/">shorten the incubation period</a> and give their offspring a better chance of survival.</p>

<p>For some scientists, the discovery of these hydrothermal habitats has been as exciting as finding the creatures they warmed. Only one other deep-sea octopus hatchery had ever been discovered before, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S096706371730256X#:~:text=Benthic%20octopods%20cluster%20on%20bare,108%20%CE%BCM).">off the Californian coast</a>. The fact that cephalopods—which are usually solitary creatures—are being found congregating near vents, scientists say, could open new doors to octopus study and discovery.</p>

<p>“It was less than a decade ago that low-temperature hydrothermal venting was confirmed on ancient volcanoes away from mid-ocean ridges,” <a href="https://www.bigelow.org/about/people/borcutt.html">Beth Orcutt</a>, a scientist at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences and a lead scientist aboard Schmidt Ocean Institute’s research vessel<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://schmidtocean.org/rv-falkor/">Falkor (too)</a></em>, says in a <a href="https://schmidtocean.org/scientists-discover-four-new-species-of-deep-sea-octopus">statement</a>. “These sites are significantly difficult to find, since you cannot detect their signatures in the water column.”</p>

<p>The new species spotted near the vents has been dubbed the “Dorado” octopus after the outcrop where it was found, making it the only one of the four to receive an unofficial nickname. Initial tests show the Dorado octopus shares many similarities with the pearl octopus (<em>Muusoctopus robustus</em>)—the most common species found among the vents <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/massive-colony-1000-brooding-octopuses-found-california-180970664/">off the Californian coast</a>, reports <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/four-new-octopus-species-discovered-in-the-deep-sea/"><em>Scientific American</em></a>’s<em> </em>Ashley Balzer Vigil. The species displays short arms and small eyes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the other three species were found farther away from the vent ecosystem. Two of them also display traits indicative of the medium-sized octopuses that belong to the <em>Muusoctopus </em>genus, boasting two rows of suckers on their longer arms, no ink sacs and, notably, bigger eyes than the Dorado octopus.</p>

<p>The fourth species, however, continues to puzzle the team. Its bumpy, pale skin and single row of suckers per arm are not easy-to-place traits, as <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fiorella-Vasquez">Fiorella Vásquez</a> and <a href="https://schmidtocean.org/person/janet-voight/">Janet Voight</a>, the two lead researchers tasked with classifying the specimens, tell <em>Scientific American.</em></p>

<p>In all, about 310 deep-sea specimens were collected across the June and December expeditions and taken to the Museum of Zoology at the University of Costa Rica. This marks one of the first times that all specimens from an octopus discovery are remaining within the Latin American country where they were found, rather than being transported to the United States or Europe, <a href="https://www.popsci.com/environment/new-octopus-species/"><em>Popular Science</em></a>’s Laura Baisas reports.</p>

<p>“The impact of the <em>R/V Falkor (too)</em> expeditions on understanding the deep Pacific waters of Costa Rica will last into the future and hopefully create awareness that evolves into policies to protect the deep sea of the country,” says Cortés-Núñez in the statement. “I hope that the expedition serves as an inspiration for new generations. We need more international collaborations to advance knowledge of our deep-sea heritage.”</p>

The way to streamline software lies in disciplined methodologies and a return to the essentials.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">Memory requirements of today’s workstations typically jump substantially – from several to many megabytes—whenever there’s a new software release. When demand surpasses capacity, it’s time to buy add-on memory. When the system has no more extensibility, it’s time to buy a new, more powerful workstation. Do increased performance and functionality keep pace with the increased demand for resources? Mostly the answer is no.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">About 25 years ago, an interactive text editor could be designed with as little as 8,000 bytes of storage. (Modern program editors request 100 times that much!) An operating system had to manage with 8,000 bytes, and a compiler had to fit into 32 Kbytes, whereas their modern descendants require megabytes. Has all this inflated software become any faster? On the contrary. Were it not for a thousand times faster hardware, modern software would be utterly unusable.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">Enhanced user convenience and functionality supposedly justify the increased size of software, but a closer look reveals these justifications to be shaky. A text editor still performs the reasonably simple task of inserting, deleting, and moving parts of text; a compiler still translates text into executable code; and an operating system still manages memory, disk space, and processor cycles. These basic obligations have not changed with the advent of windows, cut-and-paste strategies, and pop-up menus, nor with the replacement of meaningful command words by pretty icons.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">The apparent software explosion is accepted largely because of the staggering progress made by semiconductor technology, which has improved the price/performance ratio to a degree unparalleled by any other branches of technology. For example, from 1978 to 1993 Intel's 80x86 family of processors increased power by a factor of 335, transistor density by a factor of 107, and price by a factor of about 3. The prospects for continuous performance increase are still solid, and there is no sign that software’s ravenous appetite will be appeased anytime soon." This development has spawned numerous rules, laws, and corollaries, which are—as is customary in such cases—expressed in general terms; thus they are neither provable nor refutable. With a touch of humor, the following two laws reflect the state of the art admirably well:<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">·<span>      </span></span><span lang="EN-US">Software expands to fill the available memory. (Parkinson)<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">·<span>      </span></span><span lang="EN-US">Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware becomes faster. (Reiser)<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">Uncontrolled software growth has also been accepted because customers have trouble distinguishing between essential features and those that are just “nice to have.” Examples of the latter class: those arbitrarily overlapping windows suggested by the uncritically but widely adopted desktop metaphor; and fancy icons decorating the screen display, such as antique mailboxes and garbage cans that are further enhanced by the visible movement of selected items toward their ultimate destination. These details are cute but not essential, and they have a hidden cost.<o:p></o:p></span></p><h2><span lang="EN-US">CAUSES FOR “FAT SOFTWARE”<o:p></o:p></span></h2><p><span lang="EN-US">Clearly, two contributing factors to the acceptance of ever-growing software are (1) rapidly growing hardware performance and (2) customers’ ignorance of features that are essential-versus-nice to have. But perhaps more important than finding reasons for tolerance is questioning the causes: <i>What drives software toward complexity?</i><o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">A primary cause of complexity is that software vendors uncritically adopt almost any feature that users want. Any incompatibility with the original system concept is either ignored or passes unrecognized, which renders the design more complicated and its use more cumbersome. When a system’s power is measured by the number of its features, quantity becomes more important than quality. Every new release must offer additional features, even if some don't add functionality.<o:p></o:p></span></p><h2><span lang="EN-US">All features, all the time<o:p></o:p></span></h2><p><span lang="EN-US">Another important reason for software complexity lies in monolithic design, wherein all conceivable features are part of the system's design. Each customer pays for all features but actually uses very few. Ideally, only a basic system with essential facilities would be offered, a system that would lend itself to various extensions. Every customer could then select the extensions genuinely required for a given task.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">Increased hardware power has undoubtedly been the primary incentive for vendors to tackle more complex problems, and more complex problems inevitably require more complex solutions. But it is not the inherent complexity that should concern us; it is the self-inflicted complexity. There are many problems that were solved long ago, but for the same problems we are now offered solutions wrapped in much bulkier software.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">Increased complexity results in large part from our recent penchant for friendly user interaction. I've already mentioned windows and icons; color, gray-scales, shadows, pop-ups, pictures, and all kinds of gadgets can easily be added.<o:p></o:p></span></p><h2><span lang="EN-US">To some, complexity equals power.<o:p></o:p></span></h2><p><span lang="EN-US">A system’s ease of use always should be a primary goal, but that ease should be based on an underlying concept that makes the use almost intuitive. Increasingly, people seem to misinterpret complexity as sophistication, which is baffling —the incomprehensible should cause suspicion rather than admiration.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">Possibly this trend results from a mistaken belief that using a somewhat mysterious device confers an aura of power on the user. (What it does confer is a feeling of helplessness, if not impotence.) Therefore, the lure of com- plexity asa sales incentive is easily understood; complexity promotes customer dependence on the vendor.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">It’s well known, for example, that major software houses have heavily invested—with success—in customer service, employing hundreds of consultants to answer customer calls around the clock. Much more economical for both producer and consumer, however, would be a product based on a systematic concept—that is, on generally valid rules of inference rather than on tables of rules that are applicable to specific situations only—coupled with systematic documentation and a tutorial. Of course, a customer who pays—in advance—for service contracts is a more stable income source than a customer who has fully mastered a product’s use. Industry and academia are probably pursuing very different goals; hence, the emergence of another “law”:<o:p></o:p></span></p><ul type="disc"><li><span lang="EN-US">Customer dependence is more profitable than customer education.<o:p></o:p></span></li></ul><p><span lang="EN-US">What I find truly baffling are manuals—hundreds of pages long—that accompany software applications, programming languages, and operating systems. Unmistakably, they signal both a contorted design that lacks clear concepts and an intent to hook customers.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">This lack of lucid concepts can’t alone account for the software explosion. Designing solutions for complicated problems, whether in software or hardware, is a difficult, expensive, and time-consuming process. Hardware’s improved price/performance ratio has been achieved more from better technology to duplicate (fabricate) designs than from better design technique mastery. Software, however, is <i>all</i> design, and its duplication costs the vendor mere pennies.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><strong><span lang="EN-US">GOOD ENGINEERING IS CHARACTERIZED BY A GRADUAL, STEPWISE REFINEMENT OF PRODUCTS<o:p></o:p></span></strong></p><p><span lang="EN-US">Initial designs for sophisticated software applications are invariably complicated, even when developed by competent engineers. Truly good solutions emerge after iterative improvements or after redesigns that exploit new insights, and the most rewarding iterations are those that result in program simplifications. Evolutions of this kind, however, are extremely rare in current software practice—they require time-consuming thought processes that are rarely rewarded. Instead, software inadequacies are typically corrected by quickly conceived <i>additions </i>that invariably result in the well-known bulk.<o:p></o:p></span></p><h2><span lang="EN-US">Never enough time<o:p></o:p></span></h2><p><span lang="EN-US">Time pressure is probably the foremost reason behind the emergence of bulky software. The time pressure that designers endure discourages careful planning. It also discourages improving acceptable solutions; instead, it encourages quickly conceived software additions and corrections. Time pressure gradually corrupts an engineer’s standard of quality and perfection. It has a detrimental effect on people as well as products.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">The fact that the vendor whose product is first on the market is generally more successful than the competitor who arrives second, although with a better design, is another detrimental contribution to the computer industry. The tendency to adopt the “first” as the de facto standard is a deplorable phenomenon, based on the same time pressure.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">Good engineering is characterized by a gradual, stepwise refinement of products that yields increased performance under given constraints and with given resources. Software's resource limitations are blithely ignored, how- ever: Rapid increases in processor speed and memory size are commonly believed to compensate for sloppy software design. Meticulous engineering habits do not pay off in the short run, which is one reason why software plays a dubious role among established engineering disciplines.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">Abstraction can work only with languages that postulate strict, static typing of variables and functions. In this respect, C fails.<o:p></o:p></span></p><h2><span lang="EN-US">LANGUAGES AND DESIGN METHODOLOGY<o:p></o:p></span></h2><p><span lang="EN-US">Although software research, which theoretically holds the key to many future technologies, has been heavily supported, its results are seemingly irrelevant to industry. Methodical design, for example, is apparently undesirable because products so developed take too much “time to market.” Analytical verification and correctness-proof techniques fare even worse; in addition, these methods require a higher intellectual caliber than that required by the customary “try and fix it” approach. To reduce soft- ware complexity by concentrating only on the essentials is a proposal swiftly dismissed as ridiculous in view of customers’ love for bells and whistles. When “everything goes” is the modus operandi, methodologies and disciplines are the first casualties.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">Programming language methodologies are particularly controversial. In the 1970s, it was widely believed that program design must be based on well-structured methods and layers of abstraction with clearly defined specifications. The abstract data type best exemplified this idea and found expression in then-new languages such as Modula-2 and Ada. Today, programmers are abandoning well-structured languages and migrating mostly to C. The C language doesn’t even let compilers perform secure type checking, yet this compiler task is by far most helpful to program development in locating early conceptual mistakes, Without type checking, the notion of abstraction in programming languages remains hollow and academic. Abstraction can work only with languages that postulate strict, static typing of every variable and function. In this respect, C fails—it resembles assembler code, where “everything goes.”<o:p></o:p></span></p><h2><span lang="EN-US">Reinventing the wheel?<o:p></o:p></span></h2><p><span lang="EN-US">Remarkably enough, the abstract data type has reappeared 25 years after its invention under the heading <i>object oriented</i>. This modern term’s essence, regarded by many as a panacea, concerns the construction of class (type) hierarchies, Although the older concept hasn’t caught on without the newer description “object oriented,” programmers recognize the intrinsic strength of the abstract data type and convert to it. To be worthy of the description, an object-oriented language must embody strict, static typing that cannot be breached, whereby programmers can rely on the compiler to identify inconsistencies. Unfortunately, the most popular object-oriented language, C++, is no help here because it has been declared to be upwardly compatible with its ancestor C. Its wide acceptance confirms the following “laws”:<o:p></o:p></span></p><ul type="disc"><li><span lang="EN-US">Progress is acceptable only if it’s compatible with the current state.<o:p></o:p></span></li><li><span lang="EN-US">Adhering to a standard is always safer.<o:p></o:p></span></li></ul><p><span lang="EN-US">Given this situation, programmers struggle with a language that discourages structured thinking and disciplined program construction (and denies basic compiler support). They also resort to makeshift tools that chiefly add to software's bulk.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">What a grim picture; what a pessimist! the reader must be thinking. No hint of computing’s bright future, heretofore regarded as a given. This admittedly somber view is realistic; nonetheless, given the will, there is a way to improve the state of the art.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">PROJECT OBERON<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">Between 1986 and 1989, Jurg Gutknecht and I designed and implemented a new software system—called Oberon—for modern workstations, based on nothing but hardware. Our primary goal was to show that software can be developed with a fraction of the memory capacity and processor power usually required, without sacrificing flexibility, functionality, or user convenience.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">The Oberon system has been in use since 1989, serving purposes that include document preparation, software development, and computer-aided design of electronic circuits, among many others. The system includes:<o:p></o:p></span></p><ul type="disc"><li><span lang="EN-US">storage management,<o:p></o:p></span></li><li><span lang="EN-US">a file system,<o:p></o:p></span></li><li><span lang="EN-US">a window display manager,<o:p></o:p></span></li><li><span lang="EN-US">a network with servers,<o:p></o:p></span></li><li><span lang="EN-US">a compiler, and<o:p></o:p></span></li><li><span lang="EN-US">text, graphics, and document editors.<o:p></o:p></span></li></ul><p><span lang="EN-US">Designed and implemented—from scratch—by two people within three years, Oberon has since been ported to several commercially available workstations and has found many enthusiastic users, particularly since it is freely available.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">Our secondary goal was to design a system that could be studied and explained in detail, a system suitable as a software-design case study that could be penetrated top-down, and whose design decisions could be stated explicitly. (Indeed, there is a lack of published case studies in soft- ware construction, which becomes all the more evident when one is faced with the task of teaching courses.) The result of our efforts is a single book that describes the entire system and contains the source code of all modules.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">How is it possible to build a software system with some five man-years of effort and present it in a single book?<o:p></o:p></span></p><h2><span lang="EN-US">Three underlying tenets<o:p></o:p></span></h2><p><span lang="EN-US">First, we <i>concentrated on the essentials</i>.<i> </i>We omitted anything that didn’t fundamentally contribute to power and flexibility. For example, user interaction in the basic system, is confined to textual information—no graphics, pictures, or icons.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">Secondly, we wanted to use a truly object<i>-oriented programming language</i>, one that was type-safe. This, coupled with our belief that the first tenet must apply even more stringently to the tools than to the system being built, forced us to design our own language and to construct its compiler as well. It led to Oberon, a language derived fromModula-2 by eliminating less essential features (like subrange and enumeration types) in addition to features known to be unsafe (like type transfer functions and variant records).<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">Lastly, to be simple, efficient, and useful, we wanted a system to be <i>flexibly extensible</i>. This meant that new modules could be added that incorporate new procedures based on calling existing ones. It also meant that new data types could be defined (in new modules), compatible with existing types. We call these extended types, and they constitute the only fundamental concept that was added to Modula-2.<o:p></o:p></span></p><h2><span lang="EN-US">Type extension<o:p></o:p></span></h2><p><span lang="EN-US">If, for example, a type <i>Viewer</i> is defined in a module called Viewers, then a type <i>TextViewer</i> can be defined as an extension of Viewer (typically, in another module that is added to the system). Whatever operations apply to Viewers apply equally to TextViewers, and whatever properties Viewers have, TextViewers have as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">Extensibility guarantees that modules may later be added to the system without requiring either changes or recompilation. Obviously, type safety is crucial and must cross module boundaries.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">Type extension is a typical object-oriented feature. To avoid misleading anthropomorphisms, we prefer to say “TextViewers are compatible with Viewers,” rather than “TextViewers inherit from Viewers.” We also avoid introducing an entirely new nomenclature for well-known concepts; for example, we stick to the term <i>type</i>, avoiding the word <i>class</i>; we retain the terms <i>variable</i> and <i>procedure</i>, avoiding the new terms <i>instance</i> and <i>method</i>. Clearly, our first tenet—concentrating on essentials—also applies to terminology.<o:p></o:p></span></p><h2><span lang="EN-US">Tale of a data type<o:p></o:p></span></h2><p><span lang="EN-US">An example of a data type will illustrate our strategy of building basic functionality in a core system, with features added according to the system’s extensibility.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">In the system’s core, the data type <i>Text</i> is defined as character sequences with the attributes of font, offset, and color. Basic editing operations are provided in a module called <i>TextFrames</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">An electronic mail module is not included in the core, but can be added when there is a demand. When it is added, the electronic mail module relies on the core system and imports the types <i>Text</i> and <i>TextFrame</i> displaying texts. This means that normal editing operations can be applied to received e-mail messages. The messages can be modified, copied, and inserted into other texts visible on the screen display by using core operations. The only operations that the e-mail module uniquely provides are receiving, sending, and deleting a message, plus a command to list the mailbox directory.<o:p></o:p></span></p><h2><span lang="EN-US">Operation activation<o:p></o:p></span></h2><p><span lang="EN-US">Another example that illustrates our strategy is the activation of operations. Programs are not executed in Oberon; instead, individual procedures are exported from modules. If a certain module <i>M</i> exports a procedure <i>P</i>, then <i>P</i> can be called (activated) by merely pointing at the string <i>M.P</i> appearing in any text visible on the display, that is, by moving the cursor to <i>M.P</i> and clicking a mouse but- ton. Such straightforward command activation opens the following possibilities:<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">1.<span>     </span></span><span lang="EN-US">Frequently used commands are listed in short pieces of text. These are called <i>tool-texts</i> and resemble customized menus, although <i>no special menu software</i> is required. They are typically displayed in small viewers (windows).<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">2.<span>     </span></span><span lang="EN-US">By extending the system with a simple graphics editor that provides captions based on Oberon texts, commands can be highlighted and otherwise decorated with boxes and shadings. This results in pop-up and/or pull-down menus, buttons, and icons that are “free” because the basic command activation mechanism is reused.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">3.<span>     </span></span><span lang="EN-US">A message received by e-mail can contain commands as well as text. Commands are executed by the recipient’s clicking into the message (without copying into a special command window). We use this feature, for example, when announcing new or updated module releases. The message typically contains receive commands followed by lists of module names to be downloaded from the network. The entire process requires only a few mouse clicks.<o:p></o:p></span></p><h2><span lang="EN-US">Keeping it simple<o:p></o:p></span></h2><p><span lang="EN-US">The strategy of keeping the core system simple but extensible rewards the modest user. The Oberon core occupies fewer than 200 Kbytes, including editor and compiler. A computer system based on Oberon needs to be expanded only if large, demanding applications are requested, such as CAD with large memory requirements. If several such applications are used, the system does not require them to be simultaneously loaded. This economy is achieved by the following system properties:<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">1.<span>     </span></span><i><span lang="EN-US">Modules can be loaded on demand. </span></i><span lang="EN-US">Demand is signaled either when a command is activated—which is defined in a module not already loaded—or when a module being loaded imports another module not already present. Module loading can also result from data access. For example, when a document that contains graphical elements is accessed by an editor whose graphic package is not open, then this access inherently triggers its loading.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">2.<span>     </span></span><i><span lang="EN-US">Every module is in memory at most once. </span></i><span lang="EN-US">This rule prohibits the creation of linked load files (core images). Typically, linked load files are introduced in operating systems because the process of linking is complicated et and time-consuming (sometimes more so than compilation). With Oberon, linking cannot be separated from loading. This is entirely acceptable because the intertwined activities are very fast; they happen automatically the first time a module is referenced.<o:p></o:p></span></p><h2><span lang="EN-US">The price of simplicity<o:p></o:p></span></h2><p><span lang="EN-US">The experienced engineer, realizing that free lunches never are, will now ask, <i>Where is the price for this economy hidden?</i> A simplified answer is: in a clear conceptual basis and a well-conceived, appropriate system structure.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">If the core—or any other module—is to be successfully extensible, its designer must understand how it will be used. Indeed, the most demanding aspect of system design is its decomposition into modules. Each module is a part with a precisely defined interface that specifies imports and exports.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">Each module also encapsulates implementation techniques. All of its procedures must be consistent with respect to handling its exported data types. Precisely defining the right decomposition is difficult and can rarely be achieved without iterations. Iterative (tuning) improvements are of course only possible up to the time of system release.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">It is difficult to generalize design rules. If an abstract data type is defined, carefully deliberated basic operations must accompany it, but composite operations should be avoided. It’s also safe to say that the long-accepted rule of specification before implementation must be relaxed. Specifications can turn out to be as unsuitable as implementations can turn out to be wrong.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">IN CONCLUDING, HERE ARE NINE LESSONS LEARNED from the Oberon project that might be worth considering by anyone embarking on a new software design:<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">1.<span>     </span></span><span lang="EN-US">The exclusive use of a strongly typed language was the most influential factor in designing this complex system in such short time. (The manpower was a small fraction of what would typically be expended for comparably sized projects based on other languages.) Static typing (a) lets the compiler pinpoint inconsistencies before program execution; (b) lets the designer change definitions and structures with less danger of negative consequences; and (c) speeds up the improvement process, which could include changes that might not otherwise be considered feasible.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">2.<span>     </span></span><span lang="EN-US">The most difficult design task is to find the most appropriate decomposition of the whole into a module hierarchy, minimizing function and code duplications. Oberon is highly supportive in this respect by carrying type checks over module boundaries.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">3.<span>     </span></span><span lang="EN-US">Oberon’s type extension construct was essential for designing an extensible system wherein new modules added functionality <i>and</i> new object classes integrated compatibly with the existing classes or data types. Extensibility is prerequisite to keeping a system streamlined from the outset. It also permits the sys- tem to be customized to accommodate specific applications at any time, notably without access to the source code.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">4.<span>     </span></span><span lang="EN-US">In an extensible system, the key issue is to identify those primitives that offer the most flexibility for extensions, while avoiding a proliferation of primitives.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">5.<span>     </span></span><span lang="EN-US">The belief that complex systems require armies of designers and programmers is wrong. A system that is not understood in its entirety, or at least to significant degree of detail by a single individual, should probably not be built.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">6.<span>     </span></span><span lang="EN-US">Communication problems grow as the size of the design team grows. Whether they are obvious or not, when communication problems predominate, the team and the project are both in deep trouble.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">7.<span>     </span></span><span lang="EN-US">Reducing complexity and size must be the goal in every step—in system specification, design, and in detailed programming. A programmer's competence should be judged by the ability to find simple solutions, certainly not by productivity measured in “number of lines ejected per day.” Prolific programmers contribute to certain disaster.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">8.<span>     </span></span><span lang="EN-US">To gain experience, there is no substitute for one’s own programming effort. Organizing a team into man- agers, designers, programmers, analysts, and users is detrimental. All should participate (with differing degrees of emphasis) in all aspects of development. In particular, everyone—including managers—should also be product users for a time. This last measure is the best guarantee to correct mistakes and perhaps also to eliminate redundancies.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">9.<span>     </span></span><span lang="EN-US">Programs should be written and polished until they acquire publication quality. It is infinitely more demanding to design a publishable program than one that “runs.” Programs should be written for human. readers as well as for computers. If this notion contradicts certain vested interests in the commercial world, it should at least find no resistance in academia.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">With Project Oberon we have demonstrated that flexible and powerful systems can be built with substantially fewer resources in less time than usual. The plague of software explosion is not a “law of nature.” It is avoidable, and it is the software engineer’s task to curtail it.<o:p></o:p></span></p><h2>References<o:p></o:p></h2><p><span lang="EN-US">1.<span>     </span></span><span lang="EN-US">E, Perratore et al, “Fighting Fatware,” Byte, Vol. 18, No. 4, Apr. 1993, pp. 98-108.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">2.<span>     </span></span><span lang="EN-US">M, Reiser, <i>The Oberon System</i>, Addison-Wesley, Reading, Mass., 1991.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">3.<span>     </span></span><span lang="EN-US">N.
