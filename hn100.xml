<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>We need to talk about the Google Ngram Viewer n-grams. They are wrong. [D.R.H.]</p><section><p>Here's the Ngram's idea of the frequency of the word <strong><span>said</span></strong>:</p> 
<p><img src="https://cdn.etymonline.com/pictures/7e45901b5b1856dffde4625ce1b5783a.png"></p> 
<p>It doesn't look like an indicator of the diachronic change in the popularity of a very common English verb during the 20th century. It looks like the temperature graph of the last ice age. Younger people, rest assured that English authors in the 1970s did not all stop using "said" and then start again.</p> 
<p>Talia Felix and I plow in Google Books every day, researching. It is a marvel of a resource, but we know by experience how ineptly assembled that database is. And how many booby-traps lie hidden in it.</p> 
<p>I cannot tell you much about how AI works. But I can tell you how AI handles something I know how to handle. Here's another example. "The Great Toast Famine of '77"</p> 
<p><img src="https://cdn.etymonline.com/pictures/ebe7cc61ca9a9a7052b6eb2cbdf5417d.png"></p> 
<p>Ngram says <strong><span>toast</span></strong> almost vanishes from the English language by 1980, and then it pops back up.</p> 
 
<p><strong>WHY THAT'S WRONG</strong></p> 
<p>There's a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Ngram+inaccurate&amp;sca_esv=563166832&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiEE5ncmFtIGluYWNjdXJhdGUyBRAAGKIEMgUQABiiBDIFEAAYogQyBRAAGKIESM8HUFVYrwVwAXgBkAEAmAGzAaABmQKqAQMwLjK4AQPIAQD4AQHCAgoQABhHGNYEGLAD4gMEGAAgQYgGAZAGCA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">long-documented flaw</a> in the Ngram formula, inherited from Google Books. The error makes a vast number of English words appear to be diminishing in use through the 20th century only to revive around 1980.</p> 
<p>A rough gist of an explanation for it seems to be that Google Books' corpus is heavily academic. The printed matter Google sucked up from universities had a disproportion of modern scientific and academic journals in it. The articles in those journals and textbooks lean on the same few words (as academics are wont to do when they write).</p> 
<p>That not only bloats the scores for those few words, it falsely drives down the other words. That creates that mid-20th-century "dip" in the Ngram of almost every word.</p> 
<p><strong><span>Said</span></strong> likely appears less often in academic writing than in other writing, such as a novel or a newspaper. But academic papers use words such as, say, <strong><span>graph</span></strong>, a good deal more often. And here's what the Ngram for <strong><span>graph</span></strong> looks like in the 20th century:</p> 
<p><img src="https://cdn.etymonline.com/pictures/2a6e1c82c744e08c1f00ec63f2afaa6e.png"></p> 
<p>See? No dip.</p> 
<p>That's just one error. Here's another: If you look at an Ngram for <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=fuck" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the F-word</a>, you'll see very little use of it until modern times, which is expected. But the number of hits for it jumps up as you go back past about 1820, and keeps rising into the late 1700s (if you could see it). Those are all the word <strong><span>suck</span></strong>, written with the old "long " <strong>-s-</strong> — the printer's <strong>-ſ-</strong>. It looks like a lower-case <strong>-f-</strong>, in worn-down fonts on cheap paper in old libraries. The use of that character faded out about 1820. Sometimes only context tells you whether it is an <span>-f-</span> or an <span>-s-</span>. AI has no clue.</p> 
<p>Here's another: Google Books fails to recognize identity in variant spellings. The Ngram for <strong>authorise</strong> is different from that for <strong>authorize</strong>, and neither counts <strong>authorizes</strong>. Google doesn't count plural forms in the noun Ngrams. It can't tell <strong>dog</strong> from <strong>dogs</strong>.</p> 
<p>Worse, many of Google Books' files are misdated. On a battered library book, an "1896" on the cover page can look like "1800" to a digital scanner. A stack of Bible tracts from the 1910s long appeared in Google Books as published in 1799. That date did appear on all their covers — on the logo of the Bible tract society that printed them, as the date of its founding. I hardly trust Google Books dated search results to be right five times in a row. <a href="https://youtu.be/GG8qDmoR3dw?si=jxMQnyuu8fUJmLl8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">We even made a video about it</a>.</p> 
 
<p><strong>BUT PEOPLE WANT THEM</strong></p> 
<p>The text of Etymonline is built entirely from print sources, and is done entirely by human beings. Ngrams are not. They are unreliable, a sloppy product of an ignorant technology, one made to sell and distract, one never taught the difference between "influence" and "inform."</p> 
<p>Why are they on the site at all? Because now, online, pictures win and words lose. The war is over; they won. Just remember: Ngrams are unreliable. Even if the world now prefers Ngram reality, where the word "said" went into eclipse with Jimmy Carter, you're allowed to be smarter than that.</p> 
<p>When you see an Ngrams on etymonline or anywhere else, admire it as decorative, whimsical, a gourami tank in a restaurant, abstract art on hotel walls, blueprints for roller-coasters. And where the Ngrams disagree with etymonline on a first date, presume we're right and they're wrong.</p></section></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">Why is it that so many companies that rely on monetizing the data of their users seem to be extremely hot on AI? If you ask Signal president Meredith Whittaker (and I did), she’ll tell you it’s simply because “AI is a surveillance technology.”</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/amNriUZNP8w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023</a>, Whittaker explained her perspective that AI is largely inseparable from the big data and targeting industry perpetuated by the likes of Google and Meta, as well as less consumer-focused but equally prominent enterprise and defense companies. (Her remarks lightly edited for clarity.)</p>
<p>“It requires the surveillance business model; it’s an exacerbation of what we’ve seen since the late ’90s and the development of surveillance advertising. AI is a way, I think, to entrench and expand the surveillance business model,” she said. “The Venn diagram is a circle.”</p>
<p>“And the use of AI is also surveillant, right?” she continued. “You know, you walk past a facial recognition camera that’s instrumented with pseudo-scientific emotion recognition, and it produces data about you, right or wrong, that says ‘you are happy, you are sad, you have a bad character, you’re a liar, whatever.’ These are ultimately surveillance systems that are being marketed to those who have power over us generally: our employers, governments, border control, etc., to make determinations and predictions that will shape our access to resources and opportunities.”</p>
<p>Ironically, she pointed out, the data that underlies these systems is frequently organized and annotated (a necessary step in the AI dataset assembly process) by the very workers at whom it can be aimed.</p>
<p>“There’s no way to make these systems without human labor at the level of informing the ground truth of the data — reinforcement learning with human feedback, which again is just kind of tech-washing precarious human labor. It’s thousands and thousands of workers paid very little, though en masse it’s very expensive, and there’s no other way to create these systems, full stop,” she explained. “In some ways what we’re seeing is a kind of Wizard of Oz phenomenon, when we pull back the curtain there’s not that much that’s intelligent.”</p>

<p>Not all AI and machine learning systems are equally exploitative, though. When I asked if Signal uses any AI tools or processes in its app or development work, she confirmed that the app has a “small on-device model that we didn’t develop, we use it off the shelf, as part of the face blur feature in our media editing toolset. It’s not actually that good… but it helps detect faces in crowd photos and blur them, so that when you share them on social media you’re not revealing people’s intimate biometric data to, say, Clearview.”</p>
<p>“But here’s the thing. Like… yeah, that’s a great use of AI, and doesn’t that just disabuse us of all this negativity I’ve been throwing out onstage,” she added. “Sure, if that were the only market for facial recognition… but let’s be clear. The economic incentives that drive the very expensive process of developing and deploying facial recognition technology would never let that be the only use.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    
                    <p><em>Use 3D to visualize matrix multiplication expressions, attention heads with real weights, and more.</em></p>

<p>Matrix multiplications (matmuls) are the building blocks of today’s ML models. This note presents <a href="https://bhosmer.github.io/mm/ref.html">mm</a>, a visualization tool for matmuls and compositions of matmuls.</p>

<p>Because mm uses all three spatial dimensions, it helps build intuition and spark ideas with less cognitive overhead than the usual squares-on-paper idioms, especially (though not only) for visual/spatial thinkers.</p>

<p>And with three dimensions available for <em>composing</em> matmuls, along with the ability to load trained weights, we can visualize big, compound expressions like attention heads and observe how they actually behave, using im.</p>

<p>mm is fully interactive, runs <a href="https://bhosmer.github.io/mm/">in the browser</a> or <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wZIoU20eRWKtRNCW7e5Iugm3MhfaE1f7">notebook iframes</a> and keeps its complete state in the URL, so links are shareable sessions (the screenshots and videos in this note all have links that open the visualizations in the tool). This <a href="https://bhosmer.github.io/mm/ref.html">reference guide</a> describes all of the available functionality.</p>

<p>We’ll first introduce the visualization approach, build intuition by visualizing some simple matmuls and expressions, then dive into some more extended examples:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Pitch</strong> - why is this way of visualizing better?</li>
  <li><strong>Warmup - animations</strong> - watching the canonical matmul decompositions in action</li>
  <li><strong>Warmup - expressions</strong> - a quick tour of some fundamental expression building blocks</li>
  <li><strong>Inside an attention head</strong> - an in-depth look at the structure, values and computation behavior of a couple of attention heads from GPT2 via <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT">NanoGPT</a></li>
  <li><strong>Parallelizing attention</strong> - visualizing attention head parallelization with examples from the recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.19370.pdf">Blockwise Parallel Transformer</a> paper</li>
  <li><strong>Sizes in an attention layer</strong> - what do the MHA and FFA halves of an attention layer look like together, when we visualize a whole layer as a single structure? How does the picture change during autoregressive decoding?</li>
  <li><strong>LoRA</strong> - a visual explanation of this elaboration of the attention head architecture</li>
  <li><strong>Wrapup</strong> - next steps and call for feedback</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="1-pitch">1 Pitch</h2>

<p><a href="https://bhosmer.github.io/mm/ref.html">mm</a>’s visualization approach is based on the premise that <em>matrix multiplication is fundamentally a three-dimensional operation</em>.</p>

<p>When we wrap the matmul around a cube this way, the correct relationships between argument shapes, result shape and shared dimensions all fall into place.</p>

<p>Now the computation makes <em>geometric sense</em>: each location <code>i, j</code> in the result matrix anchors a vector running along the depth dimension <code>k</code> in the cube’s interior, where the horizontal plane extending from row <code>i</code> in <code>L</code> and a vertical plane extending from column <code>j</code> in <code>R</code> intersect. Along this vector, pairs of <code>(i, k)</code> <code>(k, j)</code> elements from the left and right arguments meet and are multiplied, and the resulting products are summed along <code>k</code> and the result is deposited in location <code>i, j</code> of the result.</p>

<p>This is the <em>intuitive</em> meaning of matrix multiplication:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>project</strong> two orthogonal matrices into the interior of a cube</li>
  <li><strong>multiply</strong> the pair of values at each intersection, forming a grid of products</li>
  <li><strong>sum</strong> along the third orthogonal dimension to produce a result matrix.</li>
</ol>

<p>For orientation, the tool displays an arrow in the cube’s interior that points towards the result matrix, with a blue vane coming from the left argument and a <strong>r</strong>ed vane coming from the <strong>r</strong>ight argument. The tool also displays white guidelines to indicate the row axis of each matrix, though they’re faint in this screenshot.</p>

<p>The layout constraints are straightforward:</p>

<ul>
  <li>left argument and result must be adjoined along their shared <strong>height</strong> (i) dimension</li>
  <li>right argument and result must be adjoined along their shared <strong>width</strong> (j) dimension</li>
  <li>left and right arguments must be adjoined along their shared (left width/right height) dimension, which becomes the matmul’s <strong>depth</strong> (k) dimension</li>
</ul>

<p>This geometry gives us a solid foundation for visualizing all the standard matmul decompositions, and an intuitive basis for exploring nontrivially complex <em>compositions</em> of matmuls, as we’ll see below.</p>

<h2 id="2-warmup---animations">2 Warmup - animations</h2>

<p>Before diving into some more complex examples, we’ll run through a few intuition builders to get a feel for how things look and feel in this style of visualization.</p>

<h3 id="2a-dot-product">2a Dot product</h3>

<p>First, the canonical algorithm - computing each result element by taking the dot product of the corresponding left row and right column. What we see in the animation is the sweep of multiplied value vectors through the cube’s interior, each delivering a summed result at the corresponding position.</p>

<p>Here, <code>L</code> has blocks of rows filled with 1 (blue) or -1 (red); <code>R</code> has column blocks filled similarly. <code>k</code> is 24 here, so the result matrix (<code>L @ R</code>) has blue values of 24 and red values of -24 (<a href="https://bhosmer.github.io/mm/index.html?params=%7B%22expr%22%3A%22L%20%40%20R%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22L%20%40%20R%22%2C%22epilog%22%3A%22none%22%2C%22left%22%3A%7B%22name%22%3A%22L%22%2C%22matmul%22%3Afalse%2C%22h%22%3A32%2C%22w%22%3A24%2C%22init%22%3A%22expr%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%22%2C%22min%22%3A-1%2C%22max%22%3A1%2C%22dropout%22%3A0%2C%22expr%22%3A%22-2%20*%20(Math.trunc(i%20%2F%208)%20%25%202)%20%2B%201%22%2C%22folder%22%3A%22open%22%7D%2C%22right%22%3A%7B%22name%22%3A%22R%22%2C%22matmul%22%3Afalse%2C%22h%22%3A24%2C%22w%22%3A32%2C%22init%22%3A%22expr%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%22%2C%22min%22%3A-1%2C%22max%22%3A1%2C%22dropout%22%3A0%2C%22expr%22%3A%22-2%20*%20(Math.trunc(j%20%2F%208)%20%25%202)%20%2B%201%22%2C%22folder%22%3A%22open%22%7D%2C%22anim%22%3A%7B%22fuse%22%3A%22none%22%2C%22speed%22%3A48%2C%22hide%20inputs%22%3Afalse%2C%22alg%22%3A%22dotprod%20(row%20major)%22%2C%22spin%22%3A0%2C%22folder%22%3A%22open%22%7D%2C%22block%22%3A%7B%22i%20blocks%22%3A1%2C%22j%20blocks%22%3A1%2C%22k%20blocks%22%3A1%7D%2C%22layout%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22blocks%22%2C%22gap%22%3A5%2C%22scatter%22%3A0%2C%22molecule%22%3A1%2C%22blast%22%3A0%2C%22polarity%22%3A%22negative%22%2C%22left%20placement%22%3A%22left%22%2C%22right%20placement%22%3A%22top%22%2C%22result%20placement%22%3A%22front%22%2C%22folder%22%3A%22open%22%7D%2C%22deco%22%3A%7B%22legends%22%3A6%2C%22shape%22%3Atrue%2C%22spotlight%22%3A2%2C%22row%20guides%22%3A1%2C%22flow%20guides%22%3A0.5%2C%22lens%20size%22%3A0.5%2C%22magnification%22%3A10%2C%22interior%20spotlight%22%3Afalse%2C%22axes%22%3Afalse%2C%22folder%22%3A%22closed%22%7D%2C%22viz%22%3A%7B%22sensitivity%22%3A%22semilocal%22%2C%22min%20size%22%3A0.196%2C%22min%20light%22%3A0.4%2C%22max%20light%22%3A0.6%2C%22elem%20scale%22%3A1%2C%22zero%20hue%22%3A0.77%2C%22hue%20gap%22%3A0.74%2C%22hue%20spread%22%3A0.04%2C%22folder%22%3A%22open%22%7D%2C%22diag%22%3A%7B%22url%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22cam%22%3A%7B%22x%22%3A-54.145594172414235%2C%22y%22%3A48.55110882721702%2C%22z%22%3A37.42031544768185%2C%22target%22%3A%7B%22x%22%3A0%2C%22y%22%3A0%2C%22z%22%3A0%7D%7D%2C%22folder%22%3A%22closed%22%2C%22compress%22%3Afalse%7D">open in mm</a> - long click or control-click to inspect values):</p>

<p>Switching to randomly initialized arguments, we see patterns analogous to those we saw with matrix-vector products - only this time the patterns are horizontal, corresponding to the fact that each intermediate vector-matrix product is a row-scaled replica of the right argument.</p>

<h2 id="3-warmup---expressions">3 Warmup - expressions</h2>

<p>How can we extend this visualization approach to <em>compositions</em> of matmuls? Our examples so far have all visualized a single matmul <code>L @ R</code> of some matrices <code>L</code> and <code>R</code> - what about when <code>L</code> and/or <code>R</code> are themselves matmuls, and so on transitively?</p>

<p>It turns out we can extend the approach nicely to compound expressions. The key rules are simple: the subexpression (child) matmul is another cube, subject to the same layout constraints as the parent, and the result face of the child is <em>simultaneously</em> the corresponding argument face of the parent, like a covalently shared electron.</p>

<p>Within these constraints, we’re free to arrange the faces of a child matmul however we like. Here we use the tool’s default scheme, which generates alternating convex and concave cubes - this layout works well in practice to maximize use of space and minimize occlusion. (Layouts are completely customizable, however - see the <a href="https://bhosmer.github.io/mm/ref.html">reference</a> for details.)</p>

<p>In this section we’ll visualize some of the key building blocks we find in ML models, to gain fluency in the visual idiom and to see what intuitions even simple examples can give us.</p>

<h3 id="3a-left-associative-expressions">3a Left-associative expressions</h3>

<p>We’ll look at two expressions of the form <code>(A @ B) @ C</code>, each with its own distinctive shape and character. (Note: mm adheres to the convention that matrix multiplication is left-associative and writes this simply as <code>A @ B @ C</code>.)</p>

<p>First we’ll give <code>A @ B @ C</code> the characteristic FFN shape, in which the “hidden dimension” is wider than the “input” or “output” dimensions. (Concretely in the context of this example, this means that the width of <code>B</code> is greater than the widths of <code>A</code> or <code>C</code>.)</p>

<h3 id="3b-right-associative-expressions">3b Right associative expressions</h3>

<p>Next we’ll visualize a right-associative expression <code>A @ (B @ C)</code>.</p>

<p>In the same way left-associative expressions extend horizontally - sprouting from the left argument of the root expression, so to speak - right-associative chains extend vertically, sprouting from the root’s right argument.</p>

<p>One sometimes sees an MLP formulated right-associatively, i.e. with columnar input on the right and weight layers running right to left. Using the matrices from the 2-layer FFN example pictured above - suitably transposed - here’s what that looks like, with <code>C</code> now playing the role of the input, <code>B</code> the first layer and <code>A</code> the second layer (<a href="https://bhosmer.github.io/mm/index.html?0=A%20%40%20(B%20%40%20C)&amp;1=A%20%40%20(B%20%40%20C)&amp;2=none&amp;12=closed&amp;64=true&amp;3.1=A&amp;3.4=false&amp;3.5=32&amp;3.6=96&amp;3.7=row%20major&amp;3.8=&amp;3.9=-1&amp;3.10=1&amp;3.11=0&amp;3.0=-2%20*%20(Math.trunc(j%20%2F%208)%20%25%202)%20%2B%201&amp;3.12=open&amp;13.1=B%20%40%20C&amp;13.4=true&amp;13.5=32&amp;13.6=32&amp;13.7=col%20major&amp;13.8=&amp;13.9=-1&amp;13.10=1&amp;13.11=0&amp;13.2=none&amp;14.15=inherit&amp;16.17=1&amp;18.19=positive&amp;18.20=right&amp;18.21=top&amp;18.22=back&amp;23.1=B&amp;23.4=false&amp;23.5=96&amp;23.6=32&amp;23.7=col%20major&amp;23.8=&amp;23.0=-2%20*%20(Math.trunc(j%20%2F%208)%20%25%202)%20%2B%201&amp;23.9=-1&amp;23.10=1&amp;23.11=0&amp;23.12=open&amp;24.1=C&amp;24.4=false&amp;24.5=32&amp;24.6=64&amp;24.7=expr&amp;24.8=&amp;24.0=-2%20*%20(Math.trunc(j%20%2F%208)%20%25%202)%20%2B%201&amp;24.9=-1&amp;24.10=1&amp;24.11=0&amp;24.12=open&amp;13.12=open&amp;25.26=none&amp;25.27=12&amp;25.28=false&amp;25.15=none&amp;25.29=0&amp;25.12=closed&amp;30.31=1&amp;30.32=1&amp;30.17=1&amp;33.34=blocks&amp;33.35=5&amp;33.36=0&amp;33.37=1&amp;33.38=0&amp;33.19=negative&amp;33.20=left&amp;33.21=top&amp;33.22=front&amp;33.12=closed&amp;39.40=6&amp;39.41=true&amp;39.42=2&amp;39.43=1&amp;39.44=0.5&amp;39.45=0.5&amp;39.46=10&amp;39.47=false&amp;39.48=false&amp;39.12=closed&amp;49.50=semilocal&amp;49.51=0.2&amp;49.52=0.4&amp;49.53=0.6&amp;49.54=1.25&amp;49.55=0.77&amp;49.56=0.74&amp;49.57=0.04&amp;49.12=closed&amp;58.8=&amp;58.12=open&amp;59.60=-105.78213185291946&amp;59.61=96.67420268229331&amp;59.62=113.6419504179439&amp;63.60=-4.617417891034972&amp;63.61=-3.695553245058398&amp;63.62=-1.8863985145585351&amp;expr=0&amp;name=1&amp;epilog=2&amp;left=3&amp;matmul=4&amp;h=5&amp;w=6&amp;init=7&amp;url=8&amp;min=9&amp;max=10&amp;dropout=11&amp;folder=12&amp;right=13&amp;right.anim=14&amp;alg=15&amp;right.block=16&amp;k%20blocks=17&amp;right.layout=18&amp;polarity=19&amp;left%20placement=20&amp;right%20placement=21&amp;result%20placement=22&amp;right.left=23&amp;right.right=24&amp;anim=25&amp;fuse=26&amp;speed=27&amp;hide%20inputs=28&amp;spin=29&amp;block=30&amp;i%20blocks=31&amp;j%20blocks=32&amp;layout=33&amp;scheme=34&amp;gap=35&amp;scatter=36&amp;molecule=37&amp;blast=38&amp;deco=39&amp;legends=40&amp;shape=41&amp;spotlight=42&amp;row%20guides=43&amp;flow%20guides=44&amp;lens%20size=45&amp;magnification=46&amp;interior%20spotlight=47&amp;axes=48&amp;viz=49&amp;sensitivity=50&amp;min%20size=51&amp;min%20light=52&amp;max%20light=53&amp;elem%20scale=54&amp;zero%20hue=55&amp;hue%20gap=56&amp;hue%20spread=57&amp;diag=58&amp;cam=59&amp;x=60&amp;y=61&amp;z=62&amp;cam.target=63&amp;compress=64">open in mm</a>):</p>

<p>Aside: in addition to the color of the arrow vanes (blue for left, red for right), a second visual cue for distinguishing left and right arguments is their <em>orientation</em>: the rows of the left argument are coplanar with those of the result - they stack along the same axis (<code>i</code>). Both cues tell us for example that <code>B</code> is the left argument to <code>(B @ C)</code> above.</p>

<p>For a visualization tool to be useful beyond simple didactic examples, visualizations need to remain legible as expressions get more complicated. A key structural component in real-world use cases is binary expressions - matmuls with subexpressions on both the left and right.</p>

<h3 id="3d-quick-aside-partitioning-and-parallelism">3d Quick aside: partitioning and parallelism</h3>

<p>A full presentation of this topic is out of scope for this note, though we’ll see it in action later in the context of attention heads. But as a warmup, two quick examples should give a sense of how this style of visualization makes reasoning about parallelizing compound expressions very intuitive, via the simple geometry of partitioning.</p>

<p>In the first example we’ll apply the canonical “data parallel” partitioning to the left-associative multilayer bottleneck example above.

<p>The second example would (for me, anyway) be much harder to build intuition about without clear geometry to support it: it shows how a binary expression can be parallelized by partitioning the left subexpression along its <code>j</code> axis, the right subexpression along its <code>i</code> axis, and the parent expression along its <code>k</code> axis (<a href="https://bhosmer.github.io/mm/index.html?0=A%20%40%20B%20%40%20(C%20%40%20D)&amp;1=A%20%40%20B%20%40%20(C%20%40%20D)&amp;2=none&amp;12=closed&amp;69=true&amp;3.1=A%20%40%20B&amp;3.4=true&amp;3.5=32&amp;3.6=32&amp;3.7=row%20major&amp;3.8=&amp;3.9=-1&amp;3.10=1&amp;3.11=0&amp;3.12=open&amp;3.2=none&amp;13.1=A&amp;13.4=false&amp;13.5=64&amp;13.6=64&amp;13.7=expr&amp;13.8=&amp;13.0=-2%20*%20(Math.trunc(i%20%2F%208)%20%25%202)%20%2B%201&amp;13.9=-1&amp;13.10=1&amp;13.11=0&amp;13.12=closed&amp;14.1=B&amp;14.4=false&amp;14.5=64&amp;14.6=64&amp;14.7=row%20major&amp;14.8=&amp;14.0=-2%20*%20(Math.trunc(j%20%2F%208)%20%25%202)%20%2B%201&amp;14.9=-1&amp;14.10=1&amp;14.11=0&amp;14.12=closed&amp;15.16=inherit&amp;17.18=positive&amp;17.19=left&amp;17.20=bottom&amp;17.21=back&amp;22.23=1&amp;24.1=C%20%40%20D&amp;24.4=true&amp;24.5=32&amp;24.6=32&amp;24.7=col%20major&amp;24.8=&amp;24.9=-1&amp;24.10=1&amp;24.11=0&amp;24.2=none&amp;25.16=inherit&amp;26.23=1&amp;27.18=positive&amp;27.19=right&amp;27.20=top&amp;27.21=back&amp;28.1=C&amp;28.4=false&amp;28.5=64&amp;28.6=64&amp;28.7=col%20major&amp;28.8=&amp;28.9=-1&amp;28.10=1&amp;28.11=0&amp;28.0=-2%20*%20(Math.trunc(i%20%2F%208)%20%25%202)%20%2B%201&amp;28.12=open&amp;29.1=D&amp;29.4=false&amp;29.5=64&amp;29.6=64&amp;29.7=expr&amp;29.8=&amp;29.9=-1&amp;29.10=1&amp;29.11=0&amp;29.0=-2%20*%20(Math.trunc(j%20%2F%208)%20%25%202)%20%2B%201&amp;29.12=open&amp;30.31=none&amp;30.32=12&amp;30.33=false&amp;30.16=none&amp;30.34=0&amp;30.12=closed&amp;35.36=1&amp;35.37=1&amp;35.23=8&amp;35.12=open&amp;38.39=blocks&amp;38.40=5&amp;38.41=0&amp;38.42=1&amp;38.43=0&amp;38.18=negative&amp;38.19=left&amp;38.20=top&amp;38.21=front&amp;38.12=closed&amp;44.45=6&amp;44.46=true&amp;44.47=2&amp;44.48=1&amp;44.49=0.5&amp;44.50=0.5&amp;44.51=10&amp;44.52=false&amp;44.53=false&amp;44.12=closed&amp;54.55=semilocal&amp;54.56=0.4&amp;54.57=0.4&amp;54.58=0.6&amp;54.59=1.5&amp;54.60=0.77&amp;54.61=0.74&amp;54.62=0.04&amp;54.12=open&amp;63.8=&amp;64.65=-163.0431410622342&amp;64.66=153.55767080483412&amp;64.67=176.87418575632128&amp;68.65=-4.044017278625395&amp;68.66=-2.123834827920271&amp;68.67=-2.551083969824457&amp;expr=0&amp;name=1&amp;epilog=2&amp;left=3&amp;matmul=4&amp;h=5&amp;w=6&amp;init=7&amp;url=8&amp;min=9&amp;max=10&amp;dropout=11&amp;folder=12&amp;left.left=13&amp;left.right=14&amp;left.anim=15&amp;alg=16&amp;left.layout=17&amp;polarity=18&amp;left%20placement=19&amp;right%20placement=20&amp;result%20placement=21&amp;left.block=22&amp;k%20blocks=23&amp;right=24&amp;right.anim=25&amp;right.block=26&amp;right.layout=27&amp;right.left=28&amp;right.right=29&amp;anim=30&amp;fuse=31&amp;speed=32&amp;hide%20inputs=33&amp;spin=34&amp;block=35&amp;i%20blocks=36&amp;j%20blocks=37&amp;layout=38&amp;scheme=39&amp;gap=40&amp;scatter=41&amp;molecule=42&amp;blast=43&amp;deco=44&amp;legends=45&amp;shape=46&amp;spotlight=47&amp;row%20guides=48&amp;flow%20guides=49&amp;lens%20size=50&amp;magnification=51&amp;interior%20spotlight=52&amp;axes=53&amp;viz=54&amp;sensitivity=55&amp;min%20size=56&amp;min%20light=57&amp;max%20light=58&amp;elem%20scale=59&amp;zero%20hue=60&amp;hue%20gap=61&amp;hue%20spread=62&amp;diag=63&amp;cam=64&amp;x=65&amp;y=66&amp;z=67&amp;cam.target=68&amp;compress=69">open in mm</a>):</p>

<h2 id="4-inside-an-attention-head">4 Inside an Attention Head</h2>

<p>Let’s look at a GPT2 attention head - specifically layer 5, head 4 of the “gpt2” (small) configuration (layers=12, heads=12, embed=768) from <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT">NanoGPT</a>, using OpenAI weights via HuggingFace. Input activations are taken from a forward pass on an OpenWebText training sample of 256 tokens.</p>

<p>There’s nothing particularly unusual about this particular head; I chose it mainly because it computes a fairly common attention pattern and lives in the middle of the model, where activations have become structured and show some interesting texture. (Aside: in a subsequent note I’ll present an attention head explorer that lets you visualize all layers and heads of this model, along with some travel notes.)</p>

<h3 id="4a-structure">4a Structure</h3>

<p>The entire attention head is visualized as a single compound expression, starting with input and ending with projected output. (Note: to keep things self-contained we do per-head output projection as described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08053.pdf">Megatron-LM</a>.)</p>

<p>The computation contains six matmuls:</p>

<div><pre><code>Q = input @ wQ        // 1
K_t = wK_t @ input_t  // 2
V = input @ wV        // 3
attn = sdpa(Q @ K_t)  // 4
head_out = attn @ V   // 5
out = head_out @ wO   // 6
</code></pre></div>

<p>A thumbnail description of what we’re looking at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the blades of the windmill are matmuls 1, 2, 3 and 6: the former group are the in-projections from input to Q, K and V; the latter is the out-projection from attn @ V back to the embedding dimension.</li>
  <li>at the hub is the double matmul that first calculates attention scores (convex cube in back), then uses them to produce output tokens from the values vector (concave cube in front). Causality means that the attention scores form a lower triangle.</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code>sdpa(input @ wQ @ K_t) @ V @ wO

<p>(i.e., matmuls 1, 4 , 5 and 6 above, with <code>K_t</code> and <code>V</code> precomputed) being computed as a fused chain of vector-matrix products: each item in the sequence goes all the way from input through attention to output in one step. More on this animation choice in the later section on parallelization, but first let’s look at what the values being computed tell us.</p>

">Zooming in on the Q @ K_t vector-matrix product animation</a>, the situation is even more vivid: a significant number of channels (embedding positions) in <em>both</em> <code>Q</code> and <code>K</code> look more or less constant across the sequence, implying that the useful attention signal is potentially driven by a only smallish subset of the embedding. Understanding and exploiting this phenomenon is one of the threads we’re pulling on as part of the SysML ATOM transformer efficiency project.</li>
  <li>Perhaps most familiar is the strong-but-not-perfect diagonal that emerges in the attention matrix. This is a common pattern, showing up in many of the attention heads of this model (and those of many transformers).

  <li>To get a feel for how (<code>attn @ V)</code> is formed, it’s important not to focus on attention in isolation - <code>V</code> is an equal player. Each output item is a weighted average of the entire <code>V</code> vector: at the limit when attention is a perfect diagonal, <code>attn @ V</code> is simply an exact copy of <code>V</code>.

this pattern is repeated over multiple sample inputs).</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: apropos of the last two bullet points, it’s worth reiterating that we’re visualizing computation over a <em>single sample input</em>. In practice I’ve found that each head has a characteristic pattern it will express consistently (though not identically) over a decent collection of samples (and the upcoming attention head browser will provide a collection of samples to play with), but when looking at any visualization that includes activations, it’s important to bear in mind that a full distribution of inputs may influence the ideas and intuitions it provokes it in subtle ways.</p>

<p>This is another attention head from GPT2. It behaves quite differently from layer 5, head 4 above - as one might expect, given that it’s in a very different part of the model. This head is in the very first layer: layer 0, head 2 (<a

  <li>Aside: on the one hand one might expect <em>some</em> uniformity in <code>attn @ V</code> given the effect of very evenly spread attention.

</ul>

<p>Overall, it’s hard to resist the idea that the extremely regular, highly structured information this attention head produces might be obtained by computational means that are a bit… less lavish. Of course this isn’t an unexplored area, but the specificity and richness of signal of the visualized computation has been useful in generating new ideas, and reasoning about existing ones.</p>

<h3 id="4d-revisiting-the-pitch-invariants-for-free">4d Revisiting the pitch: invariants for free</h3>

<p>Stepping back, it’s worth reiterating that the reason we can visualize nontrivially compound operations like attention heads and have them remain intuitive is that important algebraic properties - like how argument shapes are constrained, or which parallelization axes intersect which operations - <em>don’t require additional thinking</em>: they arise directly from the geometry of the visualized object, rather than being additional rules to keep in mind.</p>

<p>For example, in these attention head visualizations it’s immediately obvious that</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Q</code> and <code>attn @ V</code> are the same length, <code>K</code> and <code>V</code> are the same length, and the lengths of these pairs are independent of each other</li>
  <li><code>Q</code> and <code>K</code> are the same width, <code>V</code> and <code>attn @ V</code> are the same width, and the widths of these pairs are independent of each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>These properties are true by construction, as a simple consequence of which parts of the compound structure the constituents inhabit and how they are oriented.</p>

<h2 id="5-parallelizing-attention">5 Parallelizing attention</h2>

<p>In the animation of head 5, layer 4 above, we visualize 4 of the 6 matmuls in the attention head</p>

<p>as a fused chain of vector-matrix products, confirming the geometric intuition that the entire left-associative chain from input to output is <em>laminar</em> along the shared <code>i</code> axis, and can be parallelized.</p>

<h3 id="5a-example-partitioning-along-i">5a Example: partitioning along <code>i</code></h3>

<p>To parallelize the computation in practice, we would partition the input into blocks along the <code>i</code> axis. We can visualize this partition in the tool, by specifying that a given axis be partitioned into a particular number of blocks - in these examples we’ll use 8, but there’s nothing special about that number.</p>

<p>Among other things, this visualization makes clear that <code>wQ</code> (for in-projection), <code>K_t</code> and <code>V</code> (for attention) and <code>wO</code> (for out-projection) are needed in their entirety by each parallel computation, since they’re adjacent to the partitioned matrices along those matrices’ unpartitioned dimensions (<a

<h3 id="5b-example-double-partitioning">5b Example: double partitioning</h3>

<p>As an example of partitioning along <em>multiple</em> axes, we can visualize some recent work which innovates in this space (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.19370.pdf">Block Parallel Transformer</a>, building on work done in e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14135.pdf">Flash Attention</a> and its antecedents).</p>

<p>First, BPT partitions along <code>i</code> as described above - and actually extends this horizontal partitioning of the sequence into chunks all the way through the second (FFN) half of the attention layer as well. (We’ll visualize this in a later section.)</p>

<p>This visualization makes clear</p>

<ul>
  <li>the effectiveness of this double partitioning as an attack on the context length problem, since we’ve now visibly partitioned every occurrence of sequence length in the attention calculation</li>
  <li>the “reach” of this second partitioning: it’s clear from the geometry that the in-projection computations of <code>K</code> and <code>V</code> can be partitioned along with the core double matmul</li>
</ul>

<p>Note one subtlety: the visual implication here is that we can also parallelize the subsequent matmul <code>attn @ V</code> along <code>k</code> and sum the partial results <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/main/media/docs/efficient_gemm.md#parallelized-reductions">split-k style</a>, thus parallelizing the entire double matmul. But the row-wise softmax in <code>sdpa()</code> adds the requirement that each row have all its segments normalized before the corresponding row of <code>attn @ V</code> can be computed, adding an extra row-wise step between the attention calculation and the final matmul.</p>

<h2 id="6-sizes-in-an-attention-layer">6 Sizes in an Attention Layer</h2>

<p>The first (MHA) half of an attention layer is famously computationally demanding because of its quadratic complexity, but the second (FFN) half is demanding in its own right due to the width of its hidden dimension, typically 4 times that of the model’s embedding dimension. Visualizing the biomass of a full attention layer can be useful in building intuition about how the two halves of the layer compare to each other.</p>

<h3 id="6a-visualizing-the-full-layer">6a Visualizing the full layer</h3>

<p>Below is a full attention layer with the first half (MHA) in the background and the second (FFN) in the foreground. As usual, arrows point in the direction of computation.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This visualization doesn’t depict individual attention heads, but instead shows the unsliced Q/K/V weights and projections surrounding a central double matmul. Of course this isn’t a faithful visualization of the full MHA operation - but the goal here is to give a clearer sense of the relative matrix <em>sizes</em> in the two halves of the layer, rather than the relative amounts of computation each half performs. (Also, randomized values are used rather than real weights.)</li>
  <li>The dimensions used here are downsized to keep the browser (relatively) happy, but the proportions are preserved (from <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/blob/master/model.py#L217">NanoGPT’s small config</a>): model embedding dimension = 192 (from 768), FFN embedding dimension = 768 (from 3072), sequence length = 256 (from 1024), although sequence length is not fundamental to the model. (Visually, changes in sequence length would appear as changes in the width of the input blades, and consequently in the size of the attention hub and the height of the downstream vertical planes.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6c-partitioning-the-ffn">6c Partitioning the FFN</h3>

<p>The visualization suggests an additional partitioning, orthogonal to the ones described above - in the FFN half of the attention layer, splitting the double matmul <code>(attn_out @ FFN_1) @ FFN_2</code>, first along <code>j</code> for <code>attn_out @ FFN_1</code>, then along <code>k</code> in the subsequent matmul with <code>FFN_2</code>. This partition slices both layers of <code>FFN</code> weights, reducing the capacity requirements of each participant in the computation at the cost of a final summation of the partial results.</p>

<h3 id="6d-visualizing-token-at-a-time-decoding">6d Visualizing token-at-a-time decoding</h3>

<p>During autoregressive token-at-a-time decoding, the query vector consists of a single token. It’s instructive to have a mental picture of what an attention layer looks like in that situation - a single embedding row working its way through an enormous tiled plane of weights.</p>

<p>Aside from the emphasizing the sheer immensity of weights compared to activations, this view is also evocative of the notion that <code>K_t</code> and <code>V</code> function like dynamically generated layers in a 6-layer MLP, although the mux/demux computations of MHA itself (papered over here, per above) make the correspondence inexact (<a

<h2 id="7-lora">7 LoRA</h2>

<p>The recent LoRA paper (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf">LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models</a>) describes an efficient finetuning technique based on the idea that weight deltas introduced during finetuning are low-rank. Per the paper, this “allows us to train some dense layers in a neural network indirectly by optimizing rank decomposition matrices of the dense layers’ change during adaptation […], while keeping the pre-trained weights frozen.”</p>

<h3 id="7a-the-basic-idea">7a The basic idea</h3>

<p>In a nutshell, the key move is to train the <em>factors</em> of a weight matrix rather than the matrix itself: replace an <code>I x J</code> weights tensor with a matmul of an <code>I x K</code> tensor and a <code>K x J</code> tensor, holding <code>K</code> to some small number.</p>

<p>If <code>K</code> is small enough the size win can be huge, but the tradeoff is that lowering it lowers the rank of what the product can express. As a quick illustration of both the size savings and the structuring effect on the result, here’s a matmul of random <code>128 x 4</code> left and <code>4 x 128</code> right arguments - a.k.a. a rank-4 factorization of a <code>128 x 128</code> matrix.

<h3 id="7b-applying-lora-to-an-attention-head">7b Applying LoRA to an attention head</h3>

<p>The way LoRA applies this factoring move to the fine tuning process is to</p>

<ul>
  <li>create a low-rank factorization for each weight tensor to be fine-tuned and train the factors, keeping the original weights frozen</li>
  <li>after fine tuning, multiply each pair of low-rank factors to get a matrix in the shape of the original weights tensor, and add it to the original pretrained weights tensor</li>
</ul>

<p>The following visualization shows an attention head with the weight tensors <code>wQ</code>, <code>wK_t</code>, <code>wV</code>, <code>wO</code> replaced by low rank factorizations <code>wQ_A @ wQ_B</code>, etc. Visually, the factor matrices show up as low fences along the edges of the windmill blades (<a

<p>I’ve found this way of visualizing matmul expressions extremely helpful for building intuition and reasoning about not just matrix multiplication itself, but also many aspects of ML models and their computation, from efficiency to interpretability.</p>

<p>if you try it out and have suggestions or comments, I definitely want to hear, either in the comments here or <a href="https://github.com/bhosmer/mm">in the repo</a>.</p>

<h3 id="8b-next-steps">8b Next steps</h3>

<ul>
  <li>There’s a <a href="https://bhosmer.github.io/mm/examples/attngpt2/index.html">GPT2 attention head explorer</a> built on top of the tool which I’m currently using to inventory and classify the attention head traits found in that model. (This was the tool I used to find and explore the attention heads in this note.) Once complete I plan to post a note with the inventory.</li>
  <li>As mentioned up top, embedding these visualizations in Python notebooks is <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wZIoU20eRWKtRNCW7e5Iugm3MhfaE1f7?usp=sharing">dead simple</a>. But session URLs can get… unwieldy, so it will be useful to have Python-side utilities for constructing them from configuration objects, similar to the simple JavaScript helpers used in the <a href="https://bhosmer.github.io/mm/ref.html">reference guide</a>.</li>
  <li>If you’ve got a use case you think might benefit from visualizations like this but it’s not obvious how to use the tool to do it, get in touch! I’m not necessarily looking to expand its core visualization capabilities that much further (right tool for the job, etc.), but e.g. the API for driving it programmatically is pretty basic, there’s plenty that can be done there.</li>

Why do I love containers so much?</p><ul><li>They start quickly</li><li>They make your workloads portable</li><li>They disconnect your application stack from the OS that runs underneath</li><li>You can send your application through CI as a single container image</li><li>You can isolate workloads on the network and limit their resource usage much like a VM</li></ul><p>However, I’m still addicted to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">docker-compose</a>.
Can podman’s <a href="https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/quadlet-podman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quadlets</a> change that?</p><p><strong>Yes, I think they can.</strong></p><h2 id="whats-a-quadlet">What’s a quadlet? <span><a href="#whats-a-quadlet" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Podman introduced support for quadlets in version 4.4 and it’s a simpler way of letting systemd manage your containers.
There was an option in the past to have podman generate systemd unit files, but those were unwieldy and full of podman command line options inside a unit file.
These unit files weren’t easy to edit or even parse with eyeballs.</p><p>Quadlets make this easier by giving you a simple ini-style file that you can easily read and edit.
This blog post will include some quadlets later, but here’s an example one for Wordpress:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ini"><span><span><span>[Unit]</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Lots of the lines under <code>[Container]</code> should look familiar to most readers who have worked with containers before.
However, there’s something new here.</p><p>Check out the <code>AutoUpdate=registry</code> line.
This tells podman to keep your container updated on a regular basis with the upstream container registry.
I’ve used <a href="https://major.io/p/podman-quadlet-watchtower/">watchtower</a> in the past for this, but it requires a privileged container and it’s yet another external dependency.</p><p>Also, at the very end, you’ll see a <code>WantedBy</code> line.
This is a great place to set up container dependencies.
In this example, the container that runs <code>caddy</code> (a web server) can’t start until Wordpress is up and running.</p><h2 id="so-why-not-stick-with-docker-compose">So why not stick with docker-compose? <span><a href="#so-why-not-stick-with-docker-compose" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>There’s no denying that docker-compose is an awesome tool.
You specify the desired outcome, tell it to bring up containers, and it gets containers into the state you specified.
It handles volumes, networks, and complicated configuration without a lot of legwork.
The YAML files are pretty easy to read, too.</p><p>However, as with watchtower, that’s another external dependency.</p><p>My container deployments are often done at instance boot time and I don’t make too many changes afterwards.
I found myself using docker-compose for the initial deployment and then I didn’t really use it again.</p><p>Why not remove it entirely and use what’s built into CoreOS already?</p><h2 id="quaint-quadlets-quickly">Quaint quadlets quickly! <span><a href="#quaint-quadlets-quickly" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Before we start, we’re going to need a few things:</p><ul><li>An easy to read <a href="https://coreos.github.io/butane/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">butane</a> configuration which gets transformed into a tiny <a href="https://coreos.github.io/ignition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ignition</a> configuration for CoreOS</li><li>Some quadlets</li><li>Extra system configuration</li><li>A cloud provider with CoreOS images <em>(using <a href="https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9544589-8H" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VULTR</a> for this)</em></li></ul><p>I’ve packed all of these items into my <a href="https://github.com/major/quadlets-wordpress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quadlets-wordpress</a> repository to make it easy.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p>iPhone 15 is here, and it boasts a new charge port, a titanium frame, a periscope, and a new pro-repair design. Let’s dive inside! We’re going to focus on the 15 Pro Max, with some cameos from the other phone models.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="iPhone 15 Pro Max Teardown: Big Phone, Microscopic Scratches" width="456" height="257" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hmQHgWNAg24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2>Design Architecture</h2>



<p>For years, smartphones have either opened from the front–making battery swaps difficult, or from the back–making screen swaps challenging. Apple finally <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/64865/iphone-14-teardown">cracked this nut</a> with last year’s <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/iPhone_14">vanilla iPhone 14</a>, enabling the phone to open from the front <em>and</em> the back. This huge upgrade led us to ratchet up the iPhone’s repairability score from previous models. (We’ve since ratcheted it back down due to repair limitations imposed by parts pairing, but <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/82493/we-are-retroactively-dropping-the-iphones-repairability-score-en">that’s another story</a>.)</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="6000" height="3375" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24112635/lineup.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24112635/lineup.jpg 6000w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24112635/lineup-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24112635/lineup-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24112635/lineup-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 6000px) 100vw, 6000px"></figure>



<p>The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus thankfully adopt the iPhone 14’s advancement. There’s a central chassis, or midframe, that the internal components are mounted to. The 15 Pro and Pro Max also now open from both directions, but in an unexpectedly opposite manner: all of the internals are hiding behind the screen still instead of behind the back glass. But that back glass is now removable, too, just like the 14.</p>



<p>This notable achievement is worth celebrating. For the first time, Apple’s keynote discussed repairability:</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>There is also a new internal chassis architecture that makes iPhone more repairable, thanks to a new structural frame that allows the back glass to be easily replaced.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>This inverted chassis arrangement makes critical repairs like battery swaps slightly riskier than on the 14, because you’re removing the expensive, fragile display rather than an inert sheet of glass.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="6259" height="4694" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24112337/iPhone15_TD_46.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24112337/iPhone15_TD_46.jpg 6259w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24112337/iPhone15_TD_46-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24112337/iPhone15_TD_46-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24112337/iPhone15_TD_46-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 6259px) 100vw, 6259px"></figure>



<p>In order to get to the battery and other components you have to heat and pry open the screen, which is slightly riskier. If you accidentally tear a cable, it’s better to tear the back cover cable than it is to ruin the display.</p>



<p>The nod goes to the 14 for being slightly more risk-tolerant, but they’re both good designs. Why didn’t the 15 Pro adopt the 14’s design? We’re not sure. It may have to do with the larger camera array. The cameras protrude through a cutout in the aluminum midframe, and it’s possible there wasn’t enough room for the opposite arrangement.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="11530" height="5770" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24125711/screen_combined_3.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24125711/screen_combined_3.jpg 11530w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24125711/screen_combined_3-1536x769.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24125711/screen_combined_3-2048x1025.jpg 2048w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24125711/screen_combined_3-1798x900.jpg 1798w" sizes="(max-width: 11530px) 100vw, 11530px"><figcaption>iPhone 15 Pro Max display front and back</figcaption></figure>



<p>Apple has continued to incrementally reduce the thickness of the display bezel.</p>



<p>Some have reported that the white gasket on the perimeter of the display is new, but it’s not–it’s just changed from black to white. The design is a little different than previous phones, and some have reported that it’s more difficult to remove.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24180516/bottomrightmic-1200x800.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24180516/bottomrightmic-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24180516/bottomrightmic-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24180516/bottomrightmic-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24180516/bottomrightmic-1350x900.jpg 1350w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24180516/bottomrightmic-300x200.jpg 300w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24180516/bottomrightmic-600x400.jpg 600w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24180516/bottomrightmic-768x512.jpg 768w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24180516/bottomrightmic-324x216.jpg 324w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24180516/bottomrightmic-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></figure></div>



<p>On the base iPhone 15 models, Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/22/apple-can-repair-iphone-15-bottom-microphone/">now performing microphone repairs</a> in their service centers. This is enabled by increased modularity, where the microphone is now a separate component.</p>



<h2>Finally: USB-C</h2>



<p>Notorious for charting their own course, convincing Apple to change direction takes a monumental amount of pressure. Our Right to Repair advocacy has <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/79902/apples-u-turn-tech-giant-finally-backs-repair-in-california">already applied</a> some such pressure, and Apple’s now selling service parts and posting repair manuals. But even <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/california-follows-europes-lead-on-usb-c-mandate-for-devices">we couldn’t convince</a> them to switch to a standard port—it took the European Parliament to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/26/craig-joz-wsj-event/">force </a>that particular change.</p>

<p>And now everyone can reap the benefits! In addition to obvious compatibility advantages, the new USB-C port can provide 4.5 watts of power to external devices. That’s a massive 15x upgrade over previous Lightning phones, which can only <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/16/iphone-15-usb-c-port-charge-power-output/">output 0.3 watts</a>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213839"><img loading="lazy" width="1074" height="413" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24114417/usb-c-iphone-15.jpg" alt=""></a></figure>



<p>Going into this release, there were two rumors floating around about the charge port. The first was that the part would be serialized, pairing it to the main board and locking out independent repairs. Fortunately, this is not the case, and swapping two ports maintains full functionality. Phew!</p>



<p>The second rumor was that Apple would limit the throughput of the USB-C port for some reason.&nbsp;That rumor turned out to be unfounded. The A17 System-on-Chip (SoC) adds a USB 3 controller, enabling USB 3.2 Gen 2 10 Gb throughput. Because the non-Pro iPhone 15 models inherited the older A16 Bionic, they only support USB 2 and are limited to the same transfer speeds as previous devices with Lightning.</p>



<p>The battery in the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/iPhone_15_Pro_Max">15 Pro Max</a> is 4422 mAh, an incremental 2.3% increase over the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/iPhone_14_Pro_Max">14 Pro Max’s</a> 4323 mAh pack. Similarly, the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/iPhone_15_Pro">15 Pro</a> has an identical 2.3% 3274 mAh (2.3% increase) over the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/iPhone_14_Pro">14 Pro’s</a> 3200 mAh. This isn’t a good year for anemic battery capacity gains, because the A17 Pro is power-thirsty. Early reports are that the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Severe-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-thermal-throttling-reported-as-A17-Pro-appears-to-push-surface-temperatures-to-48-C-during-gaming.753143.0.html">phone gets hot</a> and stays hot, with a corresponding drop in battery life.</p>

<p>The battery is serviceable only by a trained technician. Fortunately, you can be a trained technician! Simply train yourself using Apple’s service manual (likely coming soon) or <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/iPhone_15_Pro_Max">iFixit’s repair guides</a> (in progress!). It’s not all that hard, we’ve helped millions of people fix their electronics themselves.</p>



<h2>A Titanium Housing</h2>



<p>The new Pro Max weighs 221 grams, 19 grams less than the 14 Pro Max. How much would you spend to save 19 grams? Pick up four nickels. What’s it worth to you to shave that much weight off of your phone? Well if you’re Apple, the answer is a heck of a lot.</p>



<figure><a href="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24123124/iPhone15_TD_42.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="5401" height="3038" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24123124/iPhone15_TD_42.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24123124/iPhone15_TD_42.jpg 5401w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24123124/iPhone15_TD_42-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24123124/iPhone15_TD_42-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24123124/iPhone15_TD_42-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 5401px) 100vw, 5401px"></a><figcaption>Left: iPhone 14 Pro Max: 221 grams.

<p>The single largest use of metal in the iPhone is in the outer frame, so that’s where Apple turned to advanced metallurgy to save some grams and gain some marketing points.</p>



<p>One <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-facts-and-estimates/">interesting theory</a> that has been floated about the reduced weight is that by shaving weight around the perimeter of the phone, it <em>feels</em> easier to move around. The technical term for this is moment of inertia, or how much force it takes to rotate the phone around its axes. As mass is removed from the edges, the phone feels more nimble in your hand—like tucking your legs in while spinning. <em>Where</em> Apple is removing the weight is a larger contributor to the “feel” than the actual 9% weight reduction.</p>



<blockquote><p>“Reducing the mass at the perimeter, which the change from stainless steel to titanium has done, has definitely reduced the moment of inertia more than a uniform reduction in mass would have. And that will make the 15 Pro easier to manipulate and will contribute—at least somewhat—to the impression of lightness.”</p><cite>Dr. Drang</cite></blockquote>

<p>Titanium is a space-grade material, used in situations where you’re willing to spend a lot of money for extra tough and lightweight materials. The titanium used in the super-fast <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird">SR-71 Blackbird</a> reconnaissance aircraft famously <a href="https://theaviationgeekclub.com/did-you-know-that-titanium-used-to-build-the-iconic-sr-71-blackbird-mach-3-spy-plane-came-from-soviet-union/">came from the unwitting Soviet Union</a>. Way back in 2001, Apple made the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/PowerBook_G4_Titanium_Series">PowerBook G4</a> out of titanium. We were particularly fond of this workhorse, which encased the display in painted titanium.</p>



<p>Manufacturers tend to avoid titanium if at all possible, not just because it’s expensive but because it’s notoriously hard to work with.</p>



<p>So while titanium made sense for the outer shell, it didn’t make a difference for the midframe, a hidden yet mechanically complex aluminum part that all the inside phone components mount to. But how do you keep the aluminum midframe <em>and </em>use titanium for the perimeter?</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Using an industry-first thermo-mechanical process, the titanium bands encase a new substructure made from 100 percent recycled aluminum, bonding these two metals with incredible strength through solid-state diffusion. The aluminum frame helps with thermal dissipation and allows the back glass to be easily replaced.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>That thermo-mechanical process is likely solid state diffusion bonding, a process where two different metals are heated really hot and then pressed together really hard. This isn’t a new idea–heating metals up and banging them together is how blacksmiths have worked for thousands of years. But these days, it’s quite rare. Wikipedia says, “Due to its relatively high cost, diffusion bonding is most often used for jobs either difficult or impossible to weld by other means.”</p>



<p>High cost? Super-hard metal? Difficult job? That sounds like something really up Apple’s alley.</p>



<p>This is approximately what a <a href="https://vacuum-furnaces.com/production-furnaces-series-3520/">diffusion bonding machine</a> looks like. It heats metals up to 1700 Celsius, or about the melting point of steel. And then it sucks all the oxygen out, creating a 10<sup>‐6</sup> torr high vacuum. Then it presses the material together with 100 tons of force. And then you leave it there for an hour. Apple’s recipe won’t match this exactly, but if this reminds you of the process for making diamonds, you’re not far off.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://vacuum-furnaces.com/production-furnaces-series-3520/"><img loading="lazy" width="861" height="587" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24114905/Sintervac-AM-spotlight.jpg" alt=""></a><figcaption>A vacuum hot chamber used for sintering 3D printed parts. Combine this with a hydraulic press and you’ve got the idea. Photo: Centorr Vacuum Industries</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>That’s an insanely complicated, expensive process that is typically limited to small production aerospace parts, not mass production of smartphones. Whatever machine Apple is using, they have <em>a lot</em> of them.</p>



<p>There are sustainability implications here. Electronics recyclers are accustomed to working with steel and aluminum, but don’t usually deal with titanium. If the titanium ended up in an aluminum shredder, it would damage or dull the blades. On the other hand, iPhones have so much residual value that they generally get special treatment in these facilities.</p>







<p>While the titanium itself is very hard, the coating on the titanium scratches quite easily. Thanks to <a href="https://www.evidentscientific.com/en/">Evident Scientific</a> for assistance with the imagery.</p>



<h2>Electronics</h2>



<p>One thing we were not expecting to find is an Apple baseband processor. Apple’s 5G modem team has been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-iphone-modem-chip-failure-6fe33d19">toiling in isolation</a> for years without any hardware to show for it. We’re not sure who to feel for, Tim Cook’s wallet or the poor Apple lawyers who had to grovel with Broadcom for a new contract. Amazingly, the hundreds of engineers working on this project for <a href="https://www.eetimes.com/infineon-adds-145-siemens-engineers-to-wireless-team-2/">first-Infineon</a>, <a href="https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/about-infineon/press/press-releases/2010/INFXX201008-069.html">then-Intel</a>, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/07/apple-to-acquire-the-majority-of-intels-smartphone-modem-business/">now-Apple</a> have yet to ship a single 5G modem to customers. That’s got to be demoralizing.</p>

<p>Sure enough, once we separated the main boards, we can confirm that Apple is using Broadcom’s high end <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/technology/modems/snapdragon-x70-modem-rf-system">Snapdragon X70 modem</a>. According to Qualcomm, it’s powered by AI for beam management and antenna tuning. AI and 5G? We’ve <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18296793/foxconn-wisconsin-location-factory-innovation-centers-technology-hub-no-news">heard that before</a>! Alas <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Exoviz-AI-8K-5G/dp/B07RM71F33">8K</a> is nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>The Apple A17 Pro hexa-core applications processor with six-core GPU layered under what is likely SK Hynix DDR5 memory.&nbsp;We’ve created a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPhone+15+Pro+Max+Chip+ID/165320">separate Chip ID page</a> with extreme detail on what all of those parts are.</p>






<p>This part is manufactured with TSMC’s <a href="https://www.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/technology/logic/l_3nm">cutting-edge 3nm process</a>, and is unlikely to be beaten by anything else anytime soon as Apple simply bought out the entirety of TSMC’s capacity for the year. Rumors are that yield on this new process are <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-pay-tsmc-3nm-good-dies-a17-bionic-and-m3-yields-at-55-percent/">still quite low</a>, making this a particularly expensive part.</p>



<p><strong>Cameras</strong></p>



<p>The big upgrade for the cameras this year is the “tetraprism” periscope lens, upping the iPhone’s optical zoom from 2x to 5x. The <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Galaxy_S23_Ultra">S23 Ultra</a> technically beats this with 10x zoom, but the way Apple’s engineers achieved it is particularly interesting.&nbsp;Tetraprism, a fancy way of saying four lenses, is a word invented by Apple’s marketing team, but it’s got a nice ring to it!</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24112755/camera_front_2-1200x800.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24112755/camera_front_2-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24112755/camera_front_2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24112755/camera_front_2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24112755/camera_front_2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24112755/camera_front_2-324x216.jpg 324w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24112755/camera_front_2-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></figure>



<p>Instead of opting for a series of lens elements controlled by electromagnets, they designed a single element “periscope” which reflects light multiple times to simulate a 120mm focal length. </p>



<figure><a href="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24212223/tetralaser.gif"><img loading="lazy" width="1236" height="672" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24212223/tetralaser.gif" alt=""></a><figcaption>The laser light coming from the left is shifted onto a higher plane by the periscope lens system.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The physics challenge that smartphone camera designers are constantly working against is the thickness of the lens system. Using a periscope allows them to offset the sensor slightly from the lens.</p>







<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="719" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24120016/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-tetraprism.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Photo: Apple</figcaption></figure>



<p>A periscope is a device for viewing things past obstacles. In this case, the obstacle is the camera itself. The mirrors bounce the light to the side, allowing for a greater focal length between the front lens and the focusing point on the sensor.</p>



<p>Aside from the new periscope lens, the sensors on the 15 Pro Max main and wide cameras seem to be the same size as last year’s 14 Pro Max—suggesting any improvement in image quality has more to do with the new A17 SoC than the camera hardware itself.</p>

<p>One surprising thing we found was substantially larger screws holding down the camera than in the past. Why? We have no idea. But we have a new microscope, and this is as good a way as any to show it off!</p>

<h2>A Great Design Undermined by Parts Pairing</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, swapping the front camera between two of our 15 Pro Max units results in complete failure. The cameras simply do not work. When we first encountered this problem last year, where the part was paired to its original device, we assumed that it was a bug that would be quickly fixed. Our trust was clearly misplaced.</p>



<p>It’s time for an urgent conversation about Apple’s approach to repairability. Despite our enthusiasm for iPhone 14’s easier-to-disassemble design, we’ve been compelled to <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/82493/we-are-retroactively-dropping-the-iphones-repairability-score-en">adjust our repairability score</a> from a promising 7 to a discouraging 4, highlighting Apple’s ongoing constriction of repair freedoms through its restrictive parts pairing system. To effectively repair these models, you have to procure parts within Apple’s sphere and validate the repairs. Without calibration, the parts either don’t work at all, or have compromised functionality and incessant warnings.</p>



<p>Repair is hard enough without software obstacles thrown into the mix. We’ve spent over $10,000 on iPhones over the last few days and our technicians have been systematically testing components to determine which repairs are possible and which are not.</p>



<p>Our objective in methodically swapping out every component in the phone is to find out whether repairs will be impossible or simply annoying. Our tests swap parts between identical, brand new devices. No aftermarket parts are involved. We’ve discovered that the rear lidar assembly, which will be critical for augmented reality functionality and creating content for the Vision Pro, is completely locked to the iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p>



<figure><a href="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/25150927/Parts-Pairing-Summary.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1465" height="661" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/25150927/Parts-Pairing-Summary.png" alt=""></a></figure>



<p>We purchased two iPhone 15 Pro Max units, and swapped the lidar modules between the two. The camera app initially loaded and then crashed. We were able to repeatedly reproduce this behavior.</p>

<p>Parts pairing in these models extends beyond mere mechanical compatibility, requiring authentication and pairing through Apple’s System Configuration tool, further limiting genuine replacements to Apple-blessed ones and substantially impacting independent repair enterprises and the overarching issue of e-waste.</p>



<p>Our insights aren’t confined to iPhones; we’ve witnessed analogous situations with MacBooks and iPads where the stranglehold on repairability is tightening, restricting the remit of repairs to Apple or forcing compromises on independent repairs. The slew of software hindrances significantly overshadow any mechanical advancements in design.</p>



<p>That <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-near-future-tale-of-refugees-and-sinister-iot-appliances/">dystopian future</a> that science fiction authors <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/eff-presents-john-scalzi-science-fiction-story-about-our-right-repair-petition">warned us</a> was coming, where DRM infected every part of our lives? We’re living in it. The result of these extensive limitations is a major infringement of ownership rights and amplification of the e-waste crisis.</p>



<h2>Repairability</h2>



<p>The iPhone 15 Pro Max, 15 Pro, 15 Plus, and 15 all earn a four out of ten. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="535" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/24181350/4_Provisional_Repairability-Score_Drop-Shadow.png" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>The score is provisional because we are awarding some credit for anticipated service manual availability and selling repair parts. Apple doesn’t have either of these live at the moment, but we expect them soon.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, software is the anchor around an otherwise exceptionally designed phone. But without the ability to swap components, repairability suffers dramatically. We don’t purchase products for our team that score below a five, so iFixit will not be purchasing the iPhone 15 for internal use.</p>



<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>



<p>The 15 is an incremental upgrade, and that’s just fine. The rollout of the 14’s innovative open-from-both-sides mechanical architecture is welcome. Investments in camera hardware are always well spent, and the periscope is particularly innovative. Given the expense, reduced drop test tolerance, recycling challenges, and fragile finish, titanium doesn’t seem like the best long-term material for a smartphone—but we’re impressed Apple pulled it off. We tip our hats at the materials engineers, but aluminum works just fine from our perspective.</p>



<p>It’s clearly time for Apple to abandon parts pairing. Some parts calibrations will need to be performed with tooling in the field, and some parts will simply need to be enabled without calibration or the same level of precision that Apple achieves in their factories. That’s perfectly acceptable for a field repair.</p>



<p>A part installed in a phone should just work. Ever since we invented interchangeable parts in the 1800s, parts have been swappable between products. Software shouldn’t be an obstacle to harvesting parts, or using aftermarket parts for that matter. The entire economy of reuse depends on interoperability, from local repair shops to large scale refurbishers to recyclers.</p>



<p>The iPhone is the market leader, but Apple is trailing the pack on repairability. This gap is completely self-inflicted, with a perfectly serviceable hardware design that is sabotaged by an incredibly complex regime of parts pairing and cloud calibrations.</p>



<p>It’s time for Apple to start thinking differently.</p>

</p></div>


<hr>



<p>In season 2 of <em>The Sopranos</em>, Davey Scatino – owner of Ramsey Sports and Outdoors and degenerate gambler – loses $10,000 in a poker game run by one of Tony Soprano’s associates. Davey, an old high school friend of Tony’s, begs him to let him play in the higher stakes poker game, the Executive Poker Game, so he can win his money back. Tony advises against it, but eventually agrees, staking Davey with $50,000 for the game. Davey loses, of course, and now Tony Soprano owns him. </p>

<hr>



<p>They buy high-priced items on store credit to resell for cash, max out the store’s credit lines with suppliers, and generally loot the store. Ultimately Davey declares bankruptcy, is divorced by his wife, and moves to Nevada. The last we see of Ramsey Sports and Outdoors is a liquidator putting up a store closing sign.</p>

<p>Oh wait, that’s not Ramsey Sports and Outdoors. </p>



<p>But of course it is.</p>



<p><strong>The story of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is the story of grown men, weak men, making wagers that they lose over and over again. </strong></p>



<p><strong>The story of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is the story of grown men, rapacious men, whose nature is to bust-out the weak men as cruelly and certainly as possible, over and over again. </strong></p>



<p><strong>The story of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is <em>our </em>story, the story of the United States here in the <em>fin de siecle</em> of <a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/the-long-now-pt-1/" data-wpel-link="internal"><em><span>The Long Now</span></em></a>, where our entire country has been busted out and stripped for parts by grown men, rapacious men, different from Tony Soprano only in that they plunder legally within a system of courts and laws and regulatory agencies.</strong></p>



<p>The story of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is a story of loss and sadness.</p>



<p>The story of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is the story of what happens when Story ends, when the reality of the bust-out — crappy stores and crappy management and overwhelming debt — finally swamps the narratives of <em>Stock Buybacks!<sup>TM</sup></em> and <em>Turnaround!<sup>TM</sup></em> and <em>Short Squeeze!<sup>TM</sup></em>. </p>



<p>And maybe a story of hope.</p>



<p>Hope how? </p>



<p>Hope that the reality of the American bust-out — crappy institutions and crappy leaders and overwhelming debt — will begin to swamp the narratives of <em>Yay, Stock Market!</em> and <em>Yay, College!</em> and <em>Boo, MAGA!</em> and <em>Boo, Wokeism!</em>. </p>



<p>Hope that the assignment of losses here at the end of an age will force us to call things by their proper names, to identify weakness as weakness and rapaciousness as rapaciousness and <span>narrative</span> as narrative. Hope that we will have the courage to reject them all. Hope that we will choose to be more clear-eyed and more full-hearted as we move forward with resolve to <a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/the-long-now-pt-2-make-protect-teach/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong><em>Make/Protect/Teach</em></strong></a> in the world <em>beyond </em>bust-out.</p>



<p>So here is the story of the weak and the rapacious and the narrative-driven. Here is the story of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. Not for shame or schadenfreude, but for hope.</p>



<hr>







<p>There are at least three distinct phases of the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond bust-out.</p>

<p>Bust Out 1 was orchestrated by the original founders and management of the company. This is where most of the money was sucked out of the company, and by the time the original founders and management were deposed in May 2019, the company was already dead.</p>



<p>Bust Out 2 was orchestrated by the management team that replaced the Bust Out 1 team, together with an external investor, Ryan Cohen. </p>



<p>Bust Out 3 is so outrageous – a self-proclaimed functionally bankrupt company selling self-proclaimed worthless equity to <span>meme</span> investors, degenerate gamblers all – that I just call it the <em>lulz </em>period.</p>



<p>Both Bust Out 2 and the <em>lulz </em>period were quite speedy looting operations, so I’ve zoomed in on the past 12 months to show the stock price moves more clearly. In particular, the exit spike for Ryan Cohen’s Bust Out 2 sale was so fast that his exit price of $22+ per share doesn’t even register on the long-term chart above!</p>



<p>In general, I think this is a common factor in all bust-out processes, whether of a company or a country, that the individual bust-out episodes become shorter, sharper and more ridiculous as there’s less and less juice to squeeze out of the orange. </p>

<p>Now let’s look at each of the bust-out periods in more detail.</p>







<hr>







<h2 data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_1bf60c-2e"><strong><em>Bust Out 1 (2014 – 2019)</em></strong></h2>



<p>We should start with the numbers before we tell the story.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="3924" height="2376" src="https://www.epsilontheory.com/wp-content/uploads/BBBY-B1-finls.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.epsilontheory.com/wp-content/uploads/BBBY-B1-finls.png 3924w, https://www.epsilontheory.com/wp-content/uploads/BBBY-B1-finls-150x91.png 150w, https://www.epsilontheory.com/wp-content/uploads/BBBY-B1-finls-768x465.png 768w, https://www.epsilontheory.com/wp-content/uploads/BBBY-B1-finls-1536x930.png 1536w, https://www.epsilontheory.com/wp-content/uploads/BBBY-B1-finls-2048x1240.png 2048w, https://www.epsilontheory.com/wp-content/uploads/BBBY-B1-finls-624x378.png 624w, https://www.epsilontheory.com/wp-content/uploads/BBBY-B1-finls-600x363.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 3924px) 100vw, 3924px"><figcaption><strong>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond financials (source: 10Ks, 10Qs, Bloomberg)</strong></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Like many retailers, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond reports its annual financials on a February fiscal year, so that their results capture the full Christmas shopping season as the culmination of the business year. This can be a little confusing, because when the chart says, for example, FY 2022, that’s actually only two months of 2022 and is mostly made up of 2021 results. Adding to the confusion, BBBY has delayed its FY 2023 annual filing, so I have to use 9 months of quarterly filings for the FY 2023 line, none of which occurred in 2023. So when I say things like “Bed Bath &amp; Beyond died in 2019”, I’m referring to the FY 2020 results.</p>



<p>Otherwise I think everything is pretty self-explanatory. CFO is cash from operations, essentially the profitability of your core, real-world business. FCF is free cash flow, the amount of money left over from CFO after you’ve satisfied the cash burden of non-operational obligations like taxes or interest payments or capex to maintain your stores. I like to focus on cash flows when I do this sort of analysis, because so much of modern accounting is designed to obfuscate or shade this most basic investment question: <em>where does the cash come from and where does it go?</em></p>



<p>Those are the numbers. Now here’s the story for Bust Out 1.</p>



<p>Bust Out 1 was orchestrated by CEO Steve Temares and company founders Leonard Feinstein and Warren Eisenberg after the disastrous 2013 Christmas shopping season. Total fiscal year operational metrics were fine! In fact, FY 2014 is the absolute peak for BBBY in cash from operations and free cash flow. But Christmas 2013 revealed the internal rot (tired stores, blah inventory, heavy discounting) and external competition (Amazon in particular, but others, too) for all to see, and the stock price took a big hit, going from $80 per share at the end of 2013 to just under $60 by the middle of 2014. </p>



<p>In response, Temares and the board announced a <em>Strategic Plan!</em> <sup>TM</sup> to reinvigorate the company, complete with a $1.5 billion bond offering, the first debt in company history. What was at the core of this grand plan, you ask? Well of course there were words like “building a leading e-commerce presence” and “targeted acquisitions” and “commitment to excellence”, but the main plank of the 2014 strategic plan and the only thing management actually executed on was simply this: <em>Stock Buybacks!</em> <sup>TM</sup>.</p>



<p><strong>In 2014, as cash operating margins declined 200 bps and cash from operations declined 15% and free cash flow declined 20% from the year before, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond borrowed $1.5 billion and bought back $2.2 billion in stock.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Over the next five years, until CEO Temares was fired and founders Feinstein and Weisenberg were kicked off the board in May 2019, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond bought back an additional $2.2 billion in stock even as cash operating margins went from 12% to 5% (I mean … good lord) and free cash flow declined by 70% from the FY 2014 high water mark.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Over the 6-year period of Bust Out 1, the board and management of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond spent $4.4 billion buying back their own stock on total free cash flow of $3.6 billion. As their stores deteriorated and their margins collapsed, this company spent ALL of their free cash flow and then $800 million MORE buying back stock. </strong></p>



<p>Now that’s a bust-out!</p>



<p>How did this personally benefit Temares, Feinstein and Weisenberg? Well, I compiled the 100+ SEC filings from these gentlemen to find out. </p>



<p>Steve Temares is a real estate lawyer who was hired by the company as their general counsel in 1992 and worked his way up the ranks. He’s not a founder. He’s not an entrepreneur. He’s a real estate lawyer who went from general counsel to executive VP to COO to CEO in 2004. I do not think it was an accident that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond also instituted their stock buyback plan when Temares was named CEO.</p>



<p>As CEO, Temares was granted a total of 5.2 million shares of stock over his tenure, either as options that he immediately sold on exercise or as stock grants at no cost. He never bought a single share of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond on the open market, but was reloaded by the board of directors every few years.</p>



<p>As CEO, Temares sold 4.3 million shares of stock for $148.4 million. This is net of all option exercise costs. This is in addition to his cash salary, bonuses and benefits, which averaged more than $4 million per year during the Bust Out 1 period. This is solely in connection with his personal holdings and is separate from the dozens of transactions associated with the family trust he established to exercise and sell additional BBBY options. After being fired as CEO, Temares sold an additional 900,000 shares for an estimated $18 million. This is in addition to his cash severance package of $36 million. <em><strong>In sum, Steve Temares received well in excess of $200 million in cash from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond shareholders, the majority of this during or after Bust Out 1.</strong></em></p>



<p>As for co-founders Leonard Feinstein and Warren Eisenberg, after the stock buyback program was introduced they each sold more than 10 million shares for an estimated $300 million. Each. This is in addition to the CEO-level salaries, bonuses and benefits they received as Co-Chairmen of the Board (my fave benefit was $230,000 in car service allowances per year; I mean, how is that possible?). This is in addition to the millions spent to make all-cash acquisitions of retail operations started by their sons, most famously $86 million in cash to acquire buybuy Baby from Leonard Feinstein’s son, including the retirement of<em> </em>$19 million in debt owed to the Feinstein family. </p>



<p>Honestly I don’t get as worked up over founders taking huge amounts of money out of a company as I do over managers, and if Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had remained a private company that the founders decided to suck dry and leave to their kids … more power to ’em. But that wasn’t what Feinstein and Eisenberg did. They took the company public, dominated the board with Steve Temares, and used stock buybacks to prop up the stock price and sell tens of millions of shares into the open market. Feinstein and Eisenberg were old school merchants! You’ll never convince me that they didn’t understand <em>exactly </em>what was happening with the accelerated operational decline of the company from 2014 forward and <em>exactly </em>what were the consequences of spending 122% of free cash flow on stock buybacks.</p>



<p>It’s no wonder that Temares, Feinstein and Eisenberg were all kicked out of the company in 2019, but by then the fatal damage was already done.</p>

<h2 data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_8aea1e-b0"><strong><em>Bust Out 2 (2021 – 2022)</em></strong></h2>



<p>It’s hard to describe how rare it is for activist investors to win a proxy fight against an entrenched CEO and Co-Chairmen of the Board who founded the company! But that’s exactly what three activist investment firms — Legion Partners, Macellum Capital and Ancora — did in 2019 when they acquired 5% of the company stock and successfully marshaled support from the other big institutional holders. The 168-page deck where they make their case is a thing of beauty, and <a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/download/70535/" data-wpel-link="internal">I’ve made it available for download here</a>. Seriously, if you are at all interested in this stuff, it’s <em>excellent </em>work.</p>



<p>With much fanfare the activists brought in a new strategy and a new CEO (Mark Tritton) from Target that November, right before the all-important Christmas season which … oops … did not go particularly well. I’ll repeat the financials chart with the post-proxy fight years highlighted to illustrate the point.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="3924" height="2376" src="https://www.epsilontheory.com/wp-content/uploads/BBBY-finls-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.epsilontheory.com/wp-content/uploads/BBBY-finls-2.png 3924w, https://www.epsilontheory.com/wp-content/uploads/BBBY-finls-2-150x91.png 150w, https://www.epsilontheory.com/wp-content/uploads/BBBY-finls-2-768x465.png 768w, https://www.epsilontheory.com/wp-content/uploads/BBBY-finls-2-1536x930.png 1536w, https://www.epsilontheory.com/wp-content/uploads/BBBY-finls-2-2048x1240.png 2048w, https://www.epsilontheory.com/wp-content/uploads/BBBY-finls-2-624x378.png 624w, https://www.epsilontheory.com/wp-content/uploads/BBBY-finls-2-600x363.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 3924px) 100vw, 3924px"><figcaption><strong>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond financials (source: 10Ks, 10Qs, Bloomberg)</strong></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Again, recall that when we’re talking about the 2019 Christmas season, that’s entirely within the FY 2020 results. Not only did the company take on $2 billion in new long-term debt as part of the management and board overhaul, but cash from operations and free cash flow continued their steady decline and the fiscal year ended poorly. And then came Covid. </p>



<p>Look, I have no idea if Mark Tritton and the new team would have been able to turn around Bed Bath &amp; Beyond under the best of circumstances. Honestly, I doubt it. But once Covid hit in March 2020 (so the start of FY 2021)? Not a chance. And you can see how the operational metrics plunge. </p>



<p>By September 30, 2020, all three of the activist funds that led the proxy fight to replace CEO Steve Temares and the entrenched board just 15 months earlier had sold their entire stakes. They’re out! In 15 months! Macellum never had much stock in the deal to begin with, so I don’t know how they fared. Ancora had a peak stake of 1.6 million shares, and it looks like they made a little profit. Legion Partners had by far the biggest stake, with peak holdings of 5.7 million shares, and it looks to me like they probably cleared a profit of $5-10 per share? Clearly these insiders used their insider status to see that there was no turnaround possible and exited before that became obvious to the world. But I don’t consider this a bust-out because I don’t see a concerted effort to prop up the stock or use a bullshit narrative like <em>Stock Buybacks!</em> <sup>TM</sup> to cover their exit. Was it an insider, privileged information sale that should have given any investor a clear signal to run away? Sure! But a bust-out? No, I don’t think so.</p>



<p>In fact, the stock went to new post-proxy fight highs in early 2021 on the heels of a better than expected Christmas season and a general lift from a Covid re-opening trade. On that basis, the activist investors got out too early. But on an operational basis … everything continued to get worse for the company and a new bust-out formula was hatched. How do I know? Because the company starts buying back stock again to prop up the stock price. </p>



<p><strong>In FY 2022, with collapsing same store sales and a $336 million free cash flow <em>deficit</em>, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond bought back $590 million in stock and depleted its cash and cash equivalents from $1.4 billion at the start of the fiscal year to less than $500 million at the end. </strong></p>



<p><strong>CEO Mark Tritton sold $5 million worth of stock grants into this renewed stock buyback program. </strong></p>



<p><strong>COO John Hartmann sold $3.5 million worth of stock grants into this renewed stock buyback program.</strong></p>



<p>This is now the end game. </p>



<p>Enter Ryan Cohen, the 36 year-old activist investor who spearheaded the meme stock revival of Gamestop and has been its Chairman since 2021. No one can sniff out a bust-out like Ryan Cohen.</p>



<p>At the tail end of FY 2022 (so February 2022), Cohen started buying stock and call options in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, creating a &gt;5% position by February 24 (7.8 million shares and 16,700 options contracts acquired for a total cost of $121 million). He notified the board on March 6, 2022 and the letter was released publicly on March 7. The stock spiked from $15 or so (Cohen’s average purchase price for his shares) to $22 and change, about a 50% jump. On March 24, Cohen signed a cooperation agreement with the board, where he agreed not to take his stake above 19.9% (as if he had any intention of doing this anyway), and in exchange the 11-person board was to be expanded to 14, with Cohen appointing the 3 new board members. </p>



<p>At which point all the meme investors who were expecting some masterstroke by Cohen … selling buybuy Baby for $5 billion? taking the company private at $40? squeezing those darn short sellers and crushing the demon-in-human-form we know as Ken Griffin? … were left a tad disappointed. Is that all there is? At which point the BBBY stock price resumed its inexorable path down, down, down. </p>



<p>By May, Cohen’s position was underwater. And then CEO Mark Tritton was fired. By July, Cohen’s position was WAY underwater. This shall not stand!</p>

<p>Going into August, 2022, 103% of the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond float (shares available for public trading) had been sold short. Now, this is not crazy. It is not <em>prima facie</em> evidence, as the Reddit meme stock apes would tell you, of naked shorts (stock shorted without a borrowed share to support it) or of the demon-in-human-form we know as Ken Griffin perverting markets from Citadel’s offices in <s>Mordor</s> Chicago. Why not? Because of the enormous daily trading volume in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond! When far more than 100% of the float changes hands every day, it’s really not so hard for the shorted float percentage to also be more than 100%. But still … this is a very high short interest for any stock, no matter the daily volume, and the drums of <em>Short Squeeze!</em> <sup>TM</sup> started pounding VERY, VERY LOUDLY throughout meme stock world.</p>



<p>To be clear, I have zero evidence or knowledge that Ryan Cohen encouraged this <em>Short Squeeze!</em> <sup>TM</sup> drum-pounding. I know that he had 121 million reasons to encourage it. I know that his 121 million reasons had a loss of about $80 million coming into August. I know that there is no human on the planet with more skill or experience in encouraging a <em>Short Squeeze!</em> <sup>TM</sup> drum-pounding than Ryan Cohen. </p>



<p><em>For whatever reasons</em>, there was a massive short squeeze in BBBY in the first two weeks of August. Massive! In late July, this stock was trading at less than $5. On August 16, the stock hit an intra-day high of more than $29! That’s like a 600% advance in three weeks. Insane. </p>



<p>And at that moment, at a top-tick price of $29.22, Ryan Cohen began to sell. He sold it all. He sold 7.8 million shares of stock on August 16, plus 16,700 call option contracts with strike prices in the 50s and 60s, for total proceeds of $189 million.</p>



<p><strong><em>In three weeks</em>, by virtue of a meme stock short squeeze that appeared out of nowhere on the Reddit meme stock boards, Ryan Cohen went from an $80 million loss on his Bed Bath &amp; Beyond position to a $68 million profit. Within a month, the stock was back under $10. Within two months, the stock was back under $5.</strong></p>



<p>Now that’s a bust-out!</p>

<h2 data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_8adf9f-a8"><strong><em>LULZ (February – March 2023)</em></strong></h2>



<p>The <em>lulz </em>period in 2023 is a variation on the meme stock Bust Out 2 of Ryan Cohen. In a nutshell, new company management worked with an external “investor” (you’ll get the reason for the quotation marks in a minute) to sell hundreds of millions of new shares of stock a few months after the Ryan Cohen debacle. I feel gross just talking about it, so if you want more detail, please check out the yeoman’s work that Bloomberg’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Matt Levine</a> has done on this. </p>

<p>Coming into 2023, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond was functionally bankrupt, with negative cash flow from operations, negative growth prospects, and long-term debt of approximately $2.5 billion. No one, least of all BBBY management (Sue Gove, interim CEO since June 2022, signed on as ‘permanent’ – lol – CEO in October 2022), had any illusions about what the future held for the company. This was now a work-out. The equity was worthless, and the only question was how the corpse of the company would get chopped up among the bondholders for some partial recovery. That’s typically something that gets worked out in bankruptcy court, and it’s a brutal, depressing, knife-fighting process. But then someone had an idea.</p>



<p>“Hey, these meme investors are degenerate gamblers. They’re easily confused and manipulated, and frankly they’re not terribly smart. It seems like we as BBBY management would be abdicating our fiduciary responsibility — not to mention our chances of getting a good job after this company winds down — if we did not take every opportunity to sell them worthless stock in our functionally bankrupt company for cash that we could could hand over to the bondholders. I think the bondholders would <em>really </em>appreciate that and did I already mention the part about getting a good job after we’re done here? Oh, I did? Well, bears repeating, right?”</p>



<p>Now I suspect that this idea did not actually originate with Sue Gove and her team, or at least the practical implementation of this (“umm, how can we sell stock in a company that we know is functionally bankrupt without … you know … going to jail and all that?”) did not originate with Sue Gove and her team. I suspect this idea came from a bondholder-associated hedge fund, law firm or investment bank — organizations filled with very smart individuals who do nothing else all day but dream up rapacious yet (arguably) legal ideas that will separate grown men, weak men, from their money. Ideas like this:</p>



<p>“Hey, meme investors, we are a probably-bankrupt company that wants to sell $1 billion worth of stock. You should definitely do your own due diligence on Reddit for what happens if we declare bankruptcy, but there’s a chance that $1 billion is enough for us to have a <em>Turnaround!</em> <sup>TM</sup>. Also, take a look at what happened to the stock of Hertz after it actually declared bankruptcy. To the moon!”</p>



<p>“Now we know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking that you already got burned with that whole Ryan Cohen thing, and we totally don’t blame you. But now the stock is so much cheaper! You can buy so many more shares now than you ever could six months ago. Plus, this time you’ll be buying your stock with <em>The Smart Money!</em> <sup>TM</sup>. Yes, we are announcing a deal where this <s>hedge fund</s> institutional investor called Hudson Bay Capital Management has already bought the first $225 million of our stock offering, and they’re committed to buying another $800 million. They’re gonna buy the whole offering! Honestly, it’s lucky for you that we’re still a publicly traded stock because otherwise you wouldn’t be able to tag along on this sweet, sweet deal. Yes, we are required to provide a public filing of our agreement with Hudson Bay, but the language is <em>really </em>complicated and hard to read, almost intentionally so. Lawyers, amirite? What’s that? Did someone say <em>Short Squeeze!</em> <sup>TM</sup>? LFG!!!!”</p>



<p>In truth, Hudson Bay was a cut-out, an intermediary who bought the equivalent of <em>hundreds of millions of shares</em> in new stock from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond only to turn around and sell <em>all of it</em> into the open market to meme investors. Selling these hundreds of millions of new shares would obviously drive down the price of the stock, but Hudson Bay was given enough of a discount and enough warrant coverage and other goodies such that — so long as trading volume remained robust within the meme investor crowd — they were basically guaranteed a healthy profit on their trade here. And if the stock price got really low (70 cents per share or thereabouts), then the deal was off and they had no more obligation to participate.</p>



<p>Over the active course of this cut-out arrangement, from February 6 to March 30, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond received approximately $360 million from Hudson Bay for preferred shares and warrants, which Hudson Bay translated into at least 300 million shares of common stock which it sold into the open market. The average price of BBBY stock over that span (leaving aside the pop on February 6 to $5.80) was approximately $1.50, which would work out to about $90 million in profits and a 25% return for Hudson Bay … not bad for a two-month bust-out!</p>



<p>After the termination of the Hudson Bay cut-out arrangement on March 30 and prior to its formal bankruptcy filing on April 24, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond continued to sell hundreds of millions of new shares directly into the market through a series of at-the-market offerings. I figure they were able to raise at least another $100 million in cash from these sales, making a grand total of about half a billion dollars over a three month span from this final (?) squeeze of the meme investor orange.</p>



<p><strong>Half a billion dollars.</strong></p>



<p>Nothing illegal about it. All wagers by grown men, free to gamble away their money in whatever way they see fit. Grown women, too, I guess, although not for the first time I am struck by the fact that the weak, degenerate gamblers in these stories are 99.99% male. (Hold that thought, please, for the last section of this note!)</p>



<p>These grown men, these meme investors, aren’t particularly upset about losing half a billion dollars. They’re not fazed by it. As I write this note, the common stock of a no-longer-functionally-bankrupt-but-now-formally-bankrupt Bed Bath &amp; Beyond trades at $0.17 per share. The average <em>daily </em>volume over the past 65 days is 123 <em>million </em>shares. If Bed Bath &amp; Beyond could issue new equity from within formal bankruptcy I’m sure they would continue to find buyers. They would continue to find grown men to perpetuate the bust-out on and on, even through bankruptcy.</p>



<p>Which gets me to this.</p>







<hr>







<h2 data-kb-block="kb-adv-heading_b27c2c-4d">The United States of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond</h2>



<p><em>At a large enough scale, the bust-out goes on forever. </em></p>



<p>Sure, it becomes more and more of a <em>lulz</em> bust-out over time, relying more and more on cut-outs and cartoons, more and more on ‘arguably’ legal ways to separate grown men from their money (and their votes). But it goes on and on all the same.</p>



<p>In the American context, my personal view is that Bill Clinton and George W. Bush presided over Bust Out 1, Barack Obama orchestrated Bust Out 2, and Donald Trump kicked off the <em>lulz </em>period, which we are now squarely in. I mean, how can you understand Trump and Biden as anything other than <em>lulz</em>?</p>



<p>In the American context, my personal view is that all of the signature economic policies of the past 30 years — ALL of them, from NAFTA to the Bush Tax Cuts to TLGP/TARP to QE1/2/3/infinity to Obamacare to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to PPP to the American Rescue Plan to the Inflation Reduction Act – have been bust-out policies. </p>



<p>And it’s not going to stop.</p>



<p>It’s not going to stop because we are increasingly a nation of weak men, degenerate gambling men, men who in their desperation for wealth or recognition will bet more than they can afford to lose over and over and over again. And I’m not talking about a loss of money, although yes that, too. I’m talking about a loss of <em>autonomy of mind</em>, where the weak man willingly gives away his very <em>identity </em>to a political party or economic creed if they will just allow him to be part of the <em>action</em>. Because in the end that’s all the weak man, the degenerate gambling man, has left. The action.</p>



<p>It’s not going to stop because we are increasingly a nation of rapacious men, clever-edging men, men who discover early on that they’re damned good at playing the game of take-the-sap’s-money and never realize until it’s too late that the table stakes for this particular game are … well, being damned themselves. And I’m not talking about being damned in the religious sense, although yes that, too. I’m talking about a loss of <em>humanity</em>, where the rapacious man willingly gives away his very <em>identity </em>to a corporation or business partnership if they will just allow him to continue <em>winning </em>the game. Because in the end that’s all the rapacious man, the clever-edging man, has left. The winning.</p>



<p>There are lots of Old Stories about times like this, when our nation itself seems like it’s sick, when our society and all within it seem to be infected by avarice and wrath and pride and lust and envy and sloth and gluttony just as surely as any virus. My favorite of these Old Stories likens it to a box of evils opened and loosed on the world. </p>



<p>But you know what remains and is preserved when the box is opened, right?</p>



<p>Hope.</p>



<p>I started this note by writing that the story of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond was maybe, just maybe, a story of hope, and that’s how I’m going to finish it. </p>



<p><strong>I am hopeful that the reality of the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond bust-out — crappy stores and crappy management and overwhelming debt ending in failure — will encourage weak men and rapacious men alike to see <em>beyond </em>the narratives of market game-playing and control.</strong></p>



<p><strong>I am hopeful that the reality of the American bust-out — crappy institutions and crappy leaders and overwhelming debt ending in failure — will similarly encourage weak men and rapacious men alike to see <em>beyond </em>the narratives of political game-playing and control. </strong></p>



<p><strong>I am hopeful, not in the common but false usage of the word as ‘optimistic’ or ‘thinking it likely’, but in the true sense of the word as being ‘full of hope’. I am full of hope that weak men will <em>choose </em>to reclaim their autonomy of mind and that rapacious men will <em>choose </em>to reclaim their humanity. </strong></p>



<p><strong>I’m not optimistic. But I am very, very hopeful!</strong></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://maa.org/press/maa-reviews/is-math-real">https://maa.org/press/maa-reviews/is-math-real</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37651260">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I settled in to read the book “Is Math Real?” expecting to become embroiled in the age-old controversary of whether math is invented or math is discovered.&nbsp; Instead, I found myself confronted with two viewpoints of mathematics: one view is that mathematics is a stiff and fixed set of rules and algorithms while the other view is that mathematics is flexible and our understanding of math comes from questioning of why mathematics functions so effectively.</p>



<p>The premise of “Is Math Real?” is that people have different emotions about math.&nbsp; Some love the math and have little difficulty determining the correct answer to a problem while others loathe and dislike the math and have a difficult time ascertaining the correct response.&nbsp; Many times, a student is humbled or chastised for asking ‘a stupid question’.&nbsp; Author Cheng states that there are no stupid questions.&nbsp; In fact, the most profound concepts in mathematics are learned from asking the simplest of questions. As teachers and professors of math, we should welcome all questions and understand that answering questions is what helps students learn.</p>



<p>The theme of this book is the denunciation of math being taught in a rigid and inflexible way. Oftentimes, math is taught as a set of rules and processes divined from an authority in which learners must memorize the rules and strictly follow the processes in order to satisfactorily find the one and only correct answer.&nbsp; Our author clearly states that math is not a fixed set of algorithms, but rather, math is the study of how logical things work.</p>



<p>There is an intriguing discussion in Chapter 3, entitled ‘Why We Do Math’, that presents three reasons why math is an important part of education: 1) math is directly useful to resolve calculation problems; 2) math is needed to study further in a variety of subjects such as science, engineering, or medicine; and 3) math has an indirect usefulness which is a way of thinking that is transferable to a myriad of disciplines and solutions to problems in everyday life.&nbsp; &nbsp;And it is this third reason that makes math relevant for most people.&nbsp; For example, the lessons learned in geometry are more than just about triangles … they are about critical thinking and laying out logical arguments.&nbsp; So that the lessons learned in geometry class prove instrumental for a Ph.D student studying microeconomics as well as the person sewing together drapes to make patterns fit together in a systematic way.</p>



<p>“Is Math Real?” treats mathematical topics in a unique and original way.&nbsp; Discussions on number patterns, Platonic solids, math history, ethnomathematics, and mathematical structures presents the reader with a plethora of ideas on how one can envision mathematics.</p>



<div><p>The question “is math real?” is answered in the epilog of this book.&nbsp; Cheng tells us that math is real because it is an idea and ideas are real.&nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>The first flight of an SR-71 took place on Dec. 22, 1964, and the first SR-71 to enter service was delivered to the 4200th (later 9th) Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Beale Air Force Base, Calif., in January 1966. </p>



<p>The Blackbird was in a different category from anything that had come before. “Everything had to be invented. Everything,” Skunk Works legendary aircraft designer Kelly Johnson recalled in an interesting article appeared on <a href="https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/features/history/blackbird.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lockheed Martin website</a>. </p>



<p>Experience gained from the A-12 program convinced the US Air Force that flying the SR-71 safely required two crew members, a pilot and a Reconnaissance Systems Officer (RSO). The RSO operated with the wide array of monitoring and defensive systems installed on the airplane. This equipment included a sophisticated Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) system that could jam most acquisition and targeting radar and the Nortronics NAS-14V2 Astroinertial Navigation System (ANS). </p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://timeandnavigation.si.edu/multimedia-asset/nortronics-nas-14v2-astroinertial-navigation-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smithsonian Institution website</a>, the ANS provided rapid celestial navigation fixes for the SR-71. </p>



<p>Mounted behind the SR-71 RSO’s cockpit, this unit (that was affectionately dubbed “R2-D2” after <a href="https://theaviationgeekclub.com/no-the-f-15-never-attacked-death-star-of-star-wars-but-the-mighty-eagle-was-the-only-us-aircraft-to-destroy-a-machine-orbiting-earth-heres-how/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Star Wars movie</a> came out in 1977), computed navigational fixes using stars sighted through the lens in the top of the unit. These fixes were used to update the inertial navigation system and provided course guidance with an accuracy of at least 90 meters (300 feet). Some current aircraft and missile systems use improved versions as a backup to GPS. </p>



<p>About the ANS RSOs were known to say, “no one can jam or shoot down the sun, the moon, the planets or the stars.” </p>



<p>Piloting the Blackbird was an unforgiving endeavor, demanding total concentration. But pilots were giddy with their complex, adrenaline-fueled responsibilities. “At 85,000 feet and Mach 3, it was almost a religious experience,” said Air Force Colonel Jim Watkins. “Nothing had prepared me to fly that fast… My God, even now, I get goose bumps remembering.” </p>

<p>But once the SR-71 reached cruising speed and altitude, it was time to focus on the mission, which was to collect information about hostile and potentially hostile nations using cameras and sensors. The pilot’s job was to handle the aircraft and watch over the automatic systems to make sure they were doing their jobs properly. Meanwhile, the RSO handled the cameras, sensors, and the all-important ANS. The ANS was the 1960’s version of GPS, but instead of using satellites to locate itself, the ANS used the stars. This is because before the invention of the modern satnav networks there wasn’t a way to navigate the SR-71 in the areas where it operated. The SR-71 needed to be able to fix its position within 1,885 feet (575 m) and within 300 ft (91 m) of the center of its flight path while traveling at high speeds for up to ten hours in the air. </p>



<p>The ANS provided specific pinpoint targets located in hostile territory. It was a Gyro compass that was able to sense the rotation of the earth, while still on the runway before the SR-71 would take off. The RSO could use his coordinates of the spot ….of one place …on the runway …then read of the ANS. They were almost always exactly the same. Not always were the same stars were used on every mission, as they used the stars depending on what part of the world they were going to fly to. If flying in the southern hemisphere* they used only the stars that were seen there.</p>

<p>On Jul. 2, 1967 Blackbird crew Jim Watkins and Dave Dempster flew the first international sortie in SR-71A #17972 when the ANS failed on a training mission and they accidentally flew in to Mexican airspace. </p>



<p>The ANS works by tracking at least two stars at a time listed in an onboard catalog, and with the aid of a chronometer, calculates a fix of the SR-71 over the ground. It was programmed before each flight and the aircraft’s primary alignment and the flight plan was recorded on a punched tape that told the aircraft where to go, when to turn, and when to turn the sensors on and off. The stars were sighted through a special quartz window (located behind the RSO cockpit) and there was a special star tracker that could see the stars even in daylight.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-74947">
	
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	
		<div data-first_letter="I">
		<p>If there’s one language that’s been at the heart of the Macintosh for the last 39 years it’s PostScript, the page description language developed by the founders of Adobe, the late John Warnock and Charles Geschke, and their team of engineers. It brought the Mac’s first commercial success in desktop publishing, in PostScript fonts, and early PostScript printers including Apple’s game-changing LaserWriter. Although Mac OS X never inherited NeXTStep’s Display PostScript, its descendant Quartz and Core Graphics are still based on PostScript’s relative PDF.</p>
<p>Following a short illness that started in macOS Monterey 12.3, PostScript has died suddenly in Sonoma.</p>
<p>The first sign passed almost unnoticed in Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-12_3-release-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release notes to macOS 12.3</a>, where it recorded the “deprecation” of PostScript in WebKit: “Support for inline viewing of PostScript files is no longer available.”</p>
<p>Then in macOS 13.0, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213250" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Preview lost the ability</a> to convert PostScript and EPS: “The Preview app included with your Mac supports PostScript (.ps) and Encapsulated PostScript (.eps) files in macOS Monterey or earlier. Starting with macOS Ventura, Preview no longer supports these files. Other apps that can view or convert .ps and .eps files are available from the App Store and elsewhere.”</p>
<p>Finally, the complete removal of support for PostScript and EPS was recorded as another “deprecation” in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-14-release-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the release notes for Sonoma</a>: “macOS has removed the functionality for converting PostScript and EPS files to PDF format. As a result, CoreGraphics’ CGPSConverter returns an error when invoked, ImageIO no longer converts EPS files, NSEPSImageRep does not display EPS files, and PMPrinterPrintWithFile does not accept a PostScript file for non-PostScript print queues.”</p>
<p>Search of Apple’s previous release notes doesn’t reveal any prior warnings of this removal of support or deprecation (in the general meaning of the term), in contrast to other removals from Sonoma such as ATS/ATSUI. Although conversion from PostScript and EPS must now be in relatively little demand, its demise has been rapid, as if Apple can’t wait for macOS to be rid of it. The most likely reason is security.</p>
<p>PostScript is an old stack-based interpreted language designed at a time when code security had barely been conceived, and malicious software hardly existed. Among its attractive features is the fact that any PostScript object can be treated as data, or executed as part of a program, and can itself generate new objects that can in turn be executed. More recently, security researchers have drawn attention to the fact that it’s a gift for anyone wishing to write and distribute malicious code. As it’s effectively an image format, embedding malware inside a PostScript file could enable that to be run without user interaction, as with some other graphics formats.</p>
<p>There are three major PostScript interpreters in common use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adobe’s Distiller engine, built into its Acrobat products,</li>
<li>Apple’s PSNormalizer engine, built into macOS,</li>
<li>Artifex’s open source engine, built into Ghostscript, and widely used in Linux and other platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Research into those engines has so far been relatively limited, but has revealed some serious vulnerabilities. Most recently, Kai Lu and Brett Stone-Gross of Zscaler’s ThreatLabz <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/smash-postscript-interpreters-using-syntax-aware-fuzzer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published an account</a> of three vulnerabilities they found in Distiller, and one in PSNormalizer, in 2022. Those were fixed by Adobe and Apple last year, in the latter case in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">macOS Monterey 12.5</a> released on 20 July 2022, and its equivalent security updates for Big Sur and Catalina. From the dates, I suspect that the removal of support for inline viewing of PostScript files in WebKit in Monterey 12.3 may also have been part of Apple’s mitigations.</p>
<p>Apple was most probably prompted into conducting a security audit of PSNormalizer as a result of the vulnerability reported, and would have been faced with the choice of re-engineering it or removing it from macOS completely. Unlike the PDF engine in Quartz, PSNormalizer is now little used, and has no significant role in macOS. The first step was to make it inaccessible from the GUI by disabling that feature in Ventura’s Preview, then following that in Sonoma by removing PSNormalizer altogether, so removing its command tool <code>pstopdf</code> and Core Graphics’ CGPSConverter.</p>
<p>This leaves those still wishing to convert PostScript files with a choice between Adobe’s Distiller in its paid-for Acrobat products, and Artifex’s Ghostscript, which has had its own share of vulnerabilities. There is also a third option, of running a late version of macOS Monterey in a lightweight VM and continuing to use PSNormalizer through Preview there. For most, that will be the cheapest and simplest option.</p>
<p>John Warnock, co-founder of Adobe and driving force behind PostScript, died on 19 August this year. His page description language had brought success to the Mac for almost 39 years, but at least PDF lives on.</p>
<p><em>I’m very grateful to Ben for drawing my attention to the changes in Sonoma.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Postscript</strong></em> (it’s only appropriate)</p>
<p>I’m now starting to see warnings from third-party app developers that, in Sonoma, their apps will be unable to open or import EPS files, for example, as they can no longer convert them using Quartz in macOS 14. Although the impact on most of us should be very small or negligible, if you do still use EPS or PostScript at any scale, you will need to prepare a solution for continuing to do so after upgrading to Sonoma. I wish you success.</p>

<p>The Pixel 8 is rapidly approaching its October 4 unveiling, but before then there are a bunch of leaks out there. Reliable leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/Za_Raczke/status/1706190950232445368">Kamila Wojciechowska</a> has a whole list of Pixel 8 and 8 Pro specs over at <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-8-pro-specifications-revealed/">91mobiles</a>, along with some Pixel<a href="https://twitter.com/Za_Raczke/status/1706277114717040721"> market materials</a>. The big news is that Google is finally giving its Pixel phones a longer support window. Pixel phones are getting <em>seven years</em> of updates, which is longer than Apple. Google pitches the Pixel phones as the flagship of the Android ecosystem, and now, if this spec sheet pans out, the OS maker is finally giving them an update plan to match.</p>
<p>Currently, Pixel phones have three years of OS updates and five years of security updates, which is not only beaten by Apple's update policy but is also inexplicably worse than many of Google's Android partners. For instance, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/samsung-now-updates-android-for-longer-than-google-does/">Samsung</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/oneplus-adds-an-extra-year-to-its-update-promise-now-at-4-years-of-major-updates/">OnePlus</a> offer four years of OS updates, albeit with some caveats around arrival times and the security update cadence. Apple doesn't have a policy written in stone anywhere, but with the iPhone X not <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/ios-and-ipados-17-drop-support-for-iphone-x-first-ipad-pros-and-other-old-devices/">making the jump</a> to iOS17, that makes for a five-year major OS update policy if you're counting to 2022's iOS16, though with some point updates in 2023 you could argue six years.</p>
<p>Google has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/pixel-6-leaks-five-years-of-security-updates-749-and-1049-price-tags/">messed around</a> in the past by calling its current "three years of major OS updates and five years of security updates" plan "five years of updates," but this spec sheet very clearly says "seven years of OS, security, and feature drop updates." That would comfortably lead all major manufacturers, leaving only Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/fairphone-5-sets-a-new-standard-with-8-10-years-of-android-support/">and Fairphone</a> at the top of the charts.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>In most of the Android world, manufacturers are dependent on their system on a chip vendor's update policy (that's usually Qualcomm) to provide Android updates. The process of shipping an Android update is an ultra-complicated relay race from Google's Android builds to the SoC vendor to the phone manufacturer. With the launch of the Pixel 6, Google started making its own SoCs (with a lot of help from Samsung's Exynos division), so every company in each step of the Android update process is just "Google." With no one else to collaborate with, the updates can last as long as Google wants.</p>

<p>The specs for the Pixel 8 Pro include something called a "Super Actua" display, which the marketing docs say will work "even in direct sunlight." The spec sheet lists 1600 nits in HDR mode and 2400 nits in "peak brightness" sunlight mode. That's probably a high point for a sunlight mode—it's certainly better than the peaks of the S23 Ultra (<a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s23-series-equal-display-brightness-fantastic-colors/">1750 nits</a>) and iPhone 15 Pro Max (<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/SP904?locale=en_US">2000 nits</a>)—but <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/nit#:~:text=One%20nit%20is%20equal%20to,cathode%20ray%20tubes%20(CRTs).">noon sunlight</a> is 1.6 billion nits. Manufacturers keep picking this fight with the sun, and while I guess brighter is better, I'm still not confident any phone will put a dent in sunlight.</p>
<p>The Pro display is the usual 120 Hz, 6.7-inch OLED, but the aspect ratio is tweaked a bit to 20:9 (the 7 Pro is 19.5:9). This spec sheet also lists a funky resolution of 2992×1344 instead of the usual 3120×1440. The device dimensions have not really changed beyond a factional millimeter, and the Pro clocks in at 162.6×76.5×8.8 mm. The battery is pretty much the same at 5050 mAh, and it still only has 30 W charging. It still has 12GB of RAM. The storage is all sorts of disappointing, with the base storage tier still 128GB, while lots of phones start at 256GB, and it's still UFS 3.1 storage, while most other flagships have UFS 4.0.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The non-pro Pixel 8 is smaller, now 6.2 inches instead of 6.3 inches, with a noticeably smaller width and height to boot. It's now at 150.5×70.8×8.9 mm. The Pixel 7 is 155.6x73.2x8.7 mm. The display is branded "Actua," and not "Super Actua," and that means 1400-nit HDR and 2000-nit peak brightness. It's still 120 Hz 2400×1080, and the lower power mode still caps at 60 Hz instead of the dynamic refresh rate of the Pro model, which can go down to 1 Hz when you aren't scrolling or watching a video. The battery is jumping from 4355 mAh to 4575 mAh, and the phone is still packing 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.</p>
<p>The one update we know is coming is the Google Tensor 3 SoC. This will be the first Google SoC to have an actual CPU upgrade. The Tensor 1 and 2 had CPU clusters headlined by two Arm Cortex X1 CPUs and benchmarked <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/pixel-7-pro-review-google-makes-refinements-to-the-best-android-phone/#h2">similarly</a>. Wojciechowska <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-8-tensor-g3-specs-3331398/">previously reported</a> the Pixel 8 would switch to a newer Cortex X3 CPU, followed by four Cortex A715 cores and four A510 cores. This would put it in the same class as a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2.</p>
<p>As for the most important spec, the price, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/09/24/google-pixel-8-price-retail-leak/">9to5Google</a> has a leak for that and says everything is getting $100 more expensive in the US. The report has the Pixel 8 at $699 and the Pixel 8 Pro at $999, with a ship date of October 12. Check back on October 4, when all of this can be officially confirmed.</p>

<p>I think the biggest reason so many indie games “fail” is that teams enter into making huge, overly ambitious projects that take years to release before they are ready. Indie teams do not spend enough time making smaller (and less profitable) games first before transitioning to multi-year projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know it seems like the modern games-industry ecosystem is unique and there is no one who can understand our plight, but indie game studios have faced similar problems for decades and they have been able to ship creative, profitable games under those conditions. It’s critical that we learn the history of our business so that we don’t repeat the same mistakes they did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While reading John Romero’s new book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doom-Guy-Life-First-Person/dp/141975811X">Doom Guy: Life in First Person</a> it occurred to me that at the start, he and the founders of id Software were facing many of the same issues modern indies are.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/trDddifG5ciQHjdOXkP77pjZ3lDJJvOpoGt2TohLIkPLc5DKScgbkvT1I5PFZdUrwNCrkI_gJtW-xNLVQDj4hmlR5UdRcGwOxrjrhBV6q1UIU2lCDyFS3nfW7eyDKoVhir5CVHNOy3ooTbYCugrriLQ" alt=""></figure>



<p>It seemed so relevant that I reached out to John Romero for an interview to see what it was like releasing indie games back in the early 1990s. The following is a transcription of the interview I did with John.</p>



<p>When appropriate, I added a bit of historical context which you can see prefaced as HISTORY. In fact, let me set the scene right now:</p>



<p><em>HISTORY: In the early 1990s, John Romero worked full time at </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softdisk"><em>Softdisk</em></a><em> which was a monthly subscription service where every month they would ship you a floppy disk full of PC games called Gamer’s Edge (think of it as an ancient Xbox Games Pass). While making games for Softdisk, his team innovated a technique that could make games on PC side scroll smoothly like the NES and formed id Software to release games that exploited this new technology. Their games they made under id Software were published by Apogee. When John quit Softdisk, the Softdisk CEO realized how much talent he was losing so he negotiated a deal with id Software where id Software would make 6-more games for Softdisk to be delivered in 1991.</em></p>



<p><em>The confluence of working full time at Softdisk, then quitting and publishing games under Apogee, and then closing out on a contract for Softdisk meant that John and his team released 27 games in 1990 and 1991. For the full list of games see the table in Appendix.</em></p>

<h4>Chris Zukowski (CZ): Why did you make so many games in 1990 and 1991?</h4>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-20-1024x576.png" alt="" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-20-1024x576.png 1024w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-20-300x169.png 300w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-20-768x432.png 768w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-20.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p><strong>John Romero (JR):</strong> When we were working at Gamer’s Edge, every two months we had to ship a game. That’s only six games in a year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we also wanted to make more Commander Keen games. And we also made games outside of work. So the first half of 1991, John Carmack and I made about three games outside of the normal work hours.</p>



<p>And then during the second half of 1991, all of our hours, once again, were spent on two games at a time. It resulted in 13 games that we made in 1991 alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From July of 1991, it took us three months to do the first Commander Keen 4 episode that was shareware. We felt like that was kind of a disaster. Like it took too long, it’s a game that everybody remembers from the Keen series, but to us it was like that was a bad, bad, bad, that it took three months, that’s nuts! We knew we had to go faster if we’re going to ship by Christmas.</p>



<p>So what we did was make Keen 5 right after 4, but then we got a deal to make a Keen for Christmas. And it had to be done before Christmas, way before Christmas, to get in boxes and in stores. So we had to do Keen 4 and then Keen 6 and then Keen 5. For Keen 5 to even make it for shareware to make it out into the market.</p>



<p>At the same time we’re trying to ship these games, we were making the first texture map 3d shooter game. Called Catacomb 3D.&nbsp; And that took two months as well to get that done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was so busy.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>CZ: How did you manage to do it that fast?</h4>



<p>JR: There were just four of us. We’d been making games every day for 10 years. So we had so much experience making games, especially small games. We knew how to scope. We knew what felt like a good size, so when we scoped it out, it was 16 levels made with a level editor, which I already had made.</p>



<h4>CZ: How did you scope it?</h4>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-21.png" alt="" width="627" height="392" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-21.png 320w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-21-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px"><figcaption>(Screenshot of the Gamer’s Edge platformer Shadow Knights)</figcaption></figure>



<p>JR: The scoping on our very first game, <a href="https://archive.org/details/msdos_Slordax_-_The_Unknown_Enemy_1991">Slordax: The Unknown Enemy</a>, was really us deciding how many levels we can make and how long it take us to make these levels. At the time, we didn’t know how long it take Adrian to do varieties of textures, tiles (with scrolling), characters, the ship, shooting, sound effects. You’ve got to create levels, you’ve got to write an editor for that. We saw how many levels we could make, and that kind of showed us what our velocity was.</p>



<p>The second game was a totally different game. It was a side scrolling ninja game called <a href="https://archive.org/details/msdos_Shadow_Knights_1990">Shadow Knights</a>. We could see how many levels we could make before we hit our two month goal. And so we could tell that we’re getting faster. The art was going at a good speed so we could determine how much data we can create for these games.</p>



<p>The same time that we’re doing that, we’re actually scoping out Commander Keen and we scoped out 48 levels to get done in these three months that we were trying to fit in.</p>



<h4>CZ: How were you disciplined to keep your ideas small enough to produce so fastt?&nbsp;</h4>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-22.png" alt="" width="643" height="401"><figcaption>Might and Magic II: Gates to Another World. John had worked on this project with a larger team</figcaption></figure>



<p>JR: I had made big games before, and it was really fun making big games [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_and_Magic_II:_Gates_to_Another_World">Might and Magic II: Gates to Another World</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_(1989_video_game)">Journey: The Quest Begins</a>]. But they were too big for one person to make. So as a team, we knew not to scope beyond the time that we knew that we had.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We knew that we were under constraints and that those constraints are finite. So we didn’t whine or complain that we weren’t making big games because we said let’s just get done with our current games and then we’ll think about what’s next. So when we got to the point where we were done with obligations to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softdisk">Softdisk Publishing</a> and we can actually just be 100 percent id Software.</p>



<h4>CZ: Weren’t all games small at that time?&nbsp;</h4>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-23.png" alt="" width="718" height="449" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-23.png 320w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-23-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 718px) 100vw, 718px"><figcaption>&nbsp;Screenshot of Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny. A huge game at the time.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>JR: </strong>Back in the 80s, there were massive games. So if you talk about, say, Ultima V, you’re looking at several years of a team of people, maybe 10 people working on it. Programming in an assembly language, making a lot of data as compressed as possible to fit on probably 10 disk sides. These projects were really big. I think they had a producer on board to handle all the tasks. And this is in the 80s.</p>



<p>So when we started making our games, especially with Keen, it was September. You have to ship for Christmas and we had to ship three games. We knew, “Okay, these are going to be fast, these won’t be really huge games, but we’ll do the best that we can.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We mapped out an initial 16 levels per game. So that’s like 48 levels. So we decided, we can do 48 levels and two and a half months plus all the code and all the art and animations.</p>



<h4>CZ: There were a lot of Keen sequels in a short period of time. Were you worried they would cannibalize each other?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>JR: No, because people just wanted more, more and more and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>History Lesson: In 1991, John Carmack began research on a 3D-real-time game engine that was the predecessor of every First Person Shooter (FPS) we have today. Carmack was doing things that had never before thought possible with a consumer-grade home computer. It was revolutionary. But, instead of just holding the tech until it was perfect, id Software published 2 smaller, more experimental games under their contract with Softdisk. Those prototype games were Hovertank 3D and Catacomb 3D. You can actually play these foundational FPS games in your browser by clicking the following links</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.retrogames.cz/play_557-DOS.php?language=EN"><em>Play Hovertank 3D</em></a></p>



<p><a href="https://www.retrogames.cz/play_555-DOS.php?language=EN"><em>Play Catacombs 3D</em></a></p>



<p><em>If you love FPS games, are making one, or just interested in games history, it is required that you try out the games just so you understand how industry-redefining games actually involve many many evolutionary baby steps that are largely forgotten. Know your gaming history.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h4>CZ: You all released the first smooth scrolling 3D game with the game Hovertank, but you published it under Gamer’s Edge, not under your studio id Software. Why reveal your hand with such revolutionary technology?</h4>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WjHVgkVdW7i4hdXDWupmGKZnLoLs3Io5HiFtYvOWOZ1H2jGB1ylou5VEbsN6m67q4UK8nkH_bU_V6PPWnQkfI7rtOuGCiHt1JxH3UIcHDhlmQAzN9WUIxgog9mUu7xlHbPGhgCrDF7oZCFfmNaLzlZI" alt="" width="725" height="453"><figcaption>Screenshot of Catacombs 3D, an early version of id Software’s revolutionary 3D engine. The first prototypes were actually shipped as Gamer’s Edge games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>JR: We were basically getting paid to experiment and do R&amp;D (Research and Development) and create a 3D engine. We made it and sold it to them. And then later we could take another chance six months later with Catacomb 3D doing texture mapping for the first time. And so it was another experiment that they’re paying us for.</p>



<p>And then with Wolfenstein 3D, we were on our own at that point. We had done 3D twice, we knew how to do it, and we’re going to do our own game this time. We didn’t need advances or anything like that kind of stuff. We already had money coming in every month (from the Keen series).</p>



<h4>CZ: When did you know you were ready to move from Keen games to make Wolfenstein and Doom?</h4>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-24.png" alt="" width="722" height="451" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-24.png 541w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-24-300x187.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px"><figcaption><em>Castle Wolfenstein 3D was the first game that id Software released after completing the Gamer’s Edge contract for 6 games. There was no time constraint in making it, so they got it out in a very long 5.5 months.</em></figcaption></figure>







<p>JR: I knew that we’re wasting our time with Keen because 3D was really where it’s going to be. It’s not going to be with this 2D stuff. We need to get out of the 2D stuff. We’d spent two weeks already making a really cool demo of Keen 7. It had VGA parallax scrolling, all this stuff that was going to be a big jump in 2D.</p>



<p>And… at one in the morning, I said “Guys, we should not be doing this game. We have this cool technology that we’re not using, that we’re not taking advantage of to make a better version of that game going forward.” And so everyone immediately went, ‘Yep, you’re right.’</p>



<p>That’s where Castle Wolfenstein was kind of born, was right then. We knew this is the first game that we’re going to make that does not have a time constraint on it. And, uh, and so this is, this is let’s make a really good game and put everything that we feel belongs in it and just do it right.</p>



<p>And that’s what we did. And it took us four months to get the shareware version out, which for us four months is crazy. We spent a month and a half getting the five episodes of maps and bosses done. And so it was a total of five and a half months with the hint book and like everything.</p>



<p>So it felt like that was great. We weren’t time-constrained. We could make a really great game and we did and everybody&nbsp;</p>



<h4>CZ: In the early days of id Software, you guys were making decent money but not Ferrari money yet. Were you upset by that? Did you know how much money the big studios were making in the 1990s?</h4>



<p>JR: When I was working at Origin Systems, they would have a company meeting and they would talk about sales and everything. And they were making amazing money, like $3,000,000 profit in 1987 (side note that is $7,605,928.98 in 2023 money.)</p>



<p>We wanted to be LucasArts and Origin in quality but make the kind of games at the size that we felt was appropriate. We don’t want to make these epic sagas. We just wanted to make really fun experiences.</p>



<h4>CZ: But At the time, Softdisk paid you just $5000 ($11,405 in 2023 dollars) for every game you developed for them. Did that seem small compared to what you saw Origin was earning?</h4>

<p>JR: No, we were blown away that it was that much. Back then rent was really cheap. It was in the hundreds of dollars per month. Our goal was to survive as a company and a team. So when we got the first check and the idea was to start the company, work full time, and there was four of us.</p>



<p>The first thing that we thought was “we need to hold on to as much money as we can in the company.” Each person at that point had a different situation with how much money they needed to spend to live every month because of their rent cost and their bills that they had. There might be a car payment or something.</p>



<p>Later, we were making $50,000 a month and, and we gave ourselves little raises, but we kept as much as we could in the bank because if, if the game didn’t sell well or we had a dry spell or took too long to make a game or whatever, we needed to be able to keep on going to finish the game and to be able to get it out.</p>



<p>So we had to be as conservative as we could possibly be. Yeah. We weren’t out buying anything. We were just working.</p>



<h4>CZ: Today your first month of sales are a large proportion of how much your game will make. What was the revenue curve like for newly launched games in the 1990s?</h4>



<p>JR: It was a very long tail. The spike wasn’t even at the beginning because BBSs (Bulletin board systems) were really limited in the amount of people that would be exposed to stuff. So, our initial spike actually went on for a long time. At minimum, it was half a year before it peaked, and then it went down.</p>



<p>Income stacking was critical. We needed to be getting income from multiple games at the same time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We made $10,500 ($23,846 in 2023 dollars) that first month of id Software. By the same time the next year, we were making $50,000 ($113,555.35) per month. And it’s because of income stacking.</p>



<p>At that point, we had the original Keen (which was still going really strong), we had the second set of Keens, and what that meant was we had a shareware version of Keen that had two pieces, which was a really bad idea, because it didn’t do as well as the first one because of that.</p>



<p>But we also had a retail Keen that was out as well, so we had three products that were out and we also had money coming in because we’re making these Gamer’s Edge games.</p>



<p>So we were just being real conservative and saving as much as we could. And then when Wolfenstein 3D hit, that changed the world basically. It was huge.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>CZ: How did you make money even after Wolfenstein and Doom hit it big?</h4>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="698" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-26-1024x698.png" alt="" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-26-1024x698.png 1024w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-26-300x205.png 300w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-26-768x524.png 768w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-26.png 1488w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Workstation of Wolfenstein 3D development <a href="https://romero.smugmug.com/Video-Games/The-Archives/i-Rb9skm4/A">From John’s photo archive</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>JR: After Doom (during Quake’s development) was when I got <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Doom">Final Doom</a> going. But I also had <a href="http://browser-doom.io/?page=game&amp;game=heretic&amp;profile=Heretic%20(Shareware)">Heretic</a> and <a href="https://gamesnostalgia.com/game/hexen-beyond-heretic">Hexen</a>. We did <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Master_Levels_for_Doom_II">Master Levels for Doom 2</a>. We were upgrading Doom to <a href="https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/The_Ultimate_Doom">Ultimate Doom</a> to go retail. It was just a lot of games. I think within the six years that I was there at id Software, we had published 35 Games or something like that.</p>



<h4>CZ: If we were to transport 20-year-old John Romero to 2023, with today’s tools, and game environment, do you think you could replicate that productivity of the 1990s?</h4>



<p>JR: I think so. When you look at the breadth of indie games and what they look like, if you go to itch. io and places where indies live, there’s such a wide range of art styles and games.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Horror games are massive with indies and there’s a 1995, a PlayStation aesthetic of graphics. That’s really big. It takes less time to make that graphic quality than it does for a realistic or semi realistic full Unreal Engine.</p>



<p>So, you could do that if you were spending the most time that you can on the gameplay part because the engine’s done. Don’t think about the engine, you think about making. Figure out what you’re making, your experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s say if it’s Unreal, are you making blueprints that are really modular for the different rooms you’re going to go in if you’re making a horror game. You want it to feel like it’s a roller coaster ride to get through.</p>



<p>So how are you pacing it? How big is it? What’s the scope?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I do game jams every once in a while. In 2017 I did a 10 hour game jam with a programmer that works at our company. In 10 hours we put together a horror adventure game, with about 13 different screens, creepy music, creepy dialogue, and it had a very weird vibe and published it.</p>



<p><a href="https://rome.ro/july-4-1976">If you want to check it out, it’s called July 4th, 1976</a>. So it’s on iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows done in, in 10 hours published on four platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a really great company in Portugal that’s putting this game together with a bunch of other indie games and they’re going to be taking the Switch version of it and it’s going to actually appear on an indie compilation on Switch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But you can see, it’s a 10 hour game. If you’re asking, what games can you get in a month, this is 10 hours.</p>

<h4>CZ: But what if my dream game is in the style of a Final Fantasy game?&nbsp;</h4>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-27-1024x683.png" alt="" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-27-1024x683.png 1024w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-27-300x200.png 300w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-27-768x512.png 768w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-27.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>JR: You need to scope way down. A scoping exercise is like the most important thing you can do at the very beginning. Like, just think about this: since we’re talking about the horror genre and I did this 10 hour thing, one of the most memorable horror demos that people have seen in recent years?</p>



<p>It’s P. T. It’s a hallway, and people won’t forget it, right? It’s a hallway. And that tells you everything about the amount of content you need to make to stick in people’s minds. It’s the design that matters. It’s not the size. It’s not a gigantic adventure. It’s doing something brand new no one has seen in the genre that you’ve chosen that’s really unique.</p>



<p>And if you’re talking about spending a lot of time on a game, spend it on design. Think about what you’re doing and think about something that’s new and pushing the boundaries of the genre that you’re in.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>CZ: What if you are stuck in a 2,3, or even 4-year-long development hell?</h4>



<p>JR: If you don’t see the end, if you don’t see a good end, if you don’t know where it’s going to end up, but you have an idea for something else that you’re more excited about, it’s really hard advice, but I would like do the thing that you’re most interested in doing, even if you’ve spent that much time.</p>



<p>It’s going to show that it’s not this big inspired amazing thing because you wouldn’t be in that position if it was. So move on to the next thing as soon as you can. You’ve learned a lot. You’ve learned what happens when you have big ideas and they don’t turn out to be what you were hoping for.</p>



<p>Try to make something maybe more doable in a shorter span of time. Even if it’s mildly successful, you’ve learned something. Do another thing that’s a little bit bigger.</p>



<p>And it could be a sequel. It could be an offshoot. If it’s the kind of game that you like, but start small always and release something that’s interesting and then go up from there. Don’t ever start with something gigantic if you haven’t done it before, because you don’t know what’s going to happen if you’ve never done it before.</p>



<p>The bigger it is, the more off course you’re going to get. Just think about an angle where you’re trying to hit a mark years down the road. If it’s off by one degree, what’s it going to look like years later?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those errors will magnify over time. So you need to make sure that you make really good decisions at the very beginning and try to correct them as soon as you can.</p>



<p>As soon as you see something’s wrong, cut your losses as soon as you can. You have a certain amount of time. You only have so many games.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>CZ: Final question, what do you think about the term Boomer Shooter?</h4>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-28-1024x576.png" alt="" srcset="https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-28-1024x576.png 1024w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-28-300x169.png 300w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-28-768x432.png 768w, https://howtomarketagame.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-28.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The funny thing about boomers, it doesn’t even matter because for people who made up the term boomer shooter, anyone who’s old as a boomer, boomers are actually the kids of World War Two vets.</p>



<p>That’s my mom. My mom is 20 years older than I am. She’s actually a boomer. So, boomers are not typically developing games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s funny. It’s a funny name. And I usually say it is a boomer shooter. It’s got a shotgun in it. It makes a big boom sound and you’re shooting. it doesn’t bug me. It’s really like you’re trying to nail the aesthetics of the style and that’s like that’s a phrase that kind of says what you need to know&nbsp;</p>

The tactic is also valuable when to comes to complicating the enemy's targeting cycles and war planning. </p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">Norwegian F-35s taxi on a road in Finland. <em>Finnish Defense Forces</em> </span></figure><p>"This is a milestone, not only for the Norwegian Air Force, but also for the Nordic countries and for NATO," Major General Rolf Folland, Chief of the Royal Norwegian Air Force, <a href="https://www.forsvaret.no/en/news/press/norwegian-f-35-landed-on-a-highway-in-finland" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a press release</a> today. "This demonstrates our ability to execute a concept of dispersal. Fighter jets are vulnerable on the ground, so by being able to use small airfields – and now motorways – [we can] increase our survivability in war."</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A Norwegian F-35A comes in to land on a highway in Finland. <em>Finnish Air Force</em> </span></figure><p>Norweigan F-35As have been training to conduct highway operations in Finland this week as part of the latest iteration of that country's annual Baana road base exercise, which kicked off on Monday. The jets were also <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/41562/arctic-pit-stop-a-first-for-british-typhoon-fighter-jets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"hot pit" refueled</a> as part of the training, which means their engines remained running while they had fuel uploaded. This reduces the time required to get them back up in the air afterward and can further reduce vulnerability, as well as increase sortie rates during surges in operations. Sometimes crew changes can also occur. Just shutting down complex fighter aircraft can increase the chances that they will have serviceability issues starting up again.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">Finnish personnel hotpit refuel a Norwegian F-35A during Baana 23. <em>Finnish Defense Forces</em> </span></figure><p>For Baana 23, a section of Finland's Regional Road 551 between the towns of Karttula and Tervo in the southern end of the country has been turned into an impromptu air base. </p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">An annotated satellite image showing the stretch of Regional Road 551 in Finland where Baana 23 is taking place. <em>Google Earth</em> </span></figure><p>"The Air Force trains regularly operations from other than a home base to be capable of a quick dispersal across the country, when necessary," a <a href="https://puolustusvoimat.fi/en/-/1951206/air-force-exercise-baana-23-in-tervo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release about the exercise</a> from the Finnish Defence Forces said. "Operation at road bases is part of the training of all Air Force pilots."</p><p>From the pictures and videos that have been released, no special measures appear to have been taken to enable Norway's F-35As to take off and land from Regional Road 551. Norwegian Joint Strike Fighters are somewhat unique in that they are the only ones in service today that have drag chutes. This feature, which is <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/blank" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also set to be incorporated</a> into <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/43458/heres-how-finland-justified-its-decision-to-buy-64-f-35-stealth-fighters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">future Finnish</a> and <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/canada-closes-deal-for-88-f-35s-to-finally-replace-its-aging-cf-18s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Canadian F-35As</a>, is there to help the jets land safely in poor winter weather conditions. It also allows for less wear-and-tear on braking systems. This could be a relevant capability for road and other short-field operations, as well, but there is no indication this feature has been employed during Baana 23. The F-35's chute is packed into a stealthy fairing between its twin tails.</p><p>Finnish <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/33855/more-than-half-of-finlands-f-18-hornets-take-part-in-an-elephant-walk-readiness-drill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">F-18C/D Hornet fighters</a> and <a href="https://ilmavoimat.fi/documents/1951206/2016308/Finnish+Air+Force+Fact+Sheet+-+Pilatus+PC-12+NG+(JAN+18).pdf/37cd924e-0b91-4337-ae25-18277c5e7b1d/Finnish+Air+Force+Fact+Sheet+-+Pilatus+PC-12+NG+(JAN+18).pdf?t=1514888009000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC-12NG</a> light utility aircraft, along with <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/41562/arctic-pit-stop-a-first-for-british-typhoon-fighter-jets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Royal Air Force (RAF) Typhoons</a> from the United Kingdom, have also been taking part in Baana 23. This exercise also marks the first time RAF Typhoons have operated from roads in Finland.</p><p>The idea of using roads as temporary runways, especially in the event that established air bases are taken out, or if the risk of that happening is high, is not new. As noted, Baana is an annual exercise and Finland <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/cockpit-view-of-flying-from-finlands-new-highway-runway" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has a long history</a> of being prepared to do just this.

Founded in the summer of 2010 by Elliott Mitchell and Alex Schwartz, BUG was the first official Unity user group in the world. At that time the Unity game engine was still a relatively new technology that empowered creators with an accessible tool for shipping games on a variety of platforms. Over the last 13 years, BUG has hosted regular monthly meetups with networking events, technical lectures, panels, interviews, parties, demo nights, workshops and more. It's been a place for us to network, share our struggles, find and give help, and learn and grow together. The consistent growth of the BUG community spawned a new era of game development in Boston and beyond.
</p>

<p>
BUG's membership has grown from a few dozen to a few thousand, bringing together everyone from Boston's indies, hobbyists, AAA developers, AI researchers, museum exhibit designers, med-tech innovators, archeologists, automotive designers, software engineers, volumetric filmmakers, VR/XR game makers, educators and countless others. With growing membership our leadership team also grew. Jono Forbes, Graham Pentheny, and Chris Hart joined Elliott in organizing BUG's events and online presence. Unity lived up to its name, bringing together people with widely diverse backgrounds under a shared love for creating interactive technology.
</p>

<p>
From day one, BUG was enthusiastically sanctioned and supported by Unity and former CEO David Helgason. Unity provided logistical support, Pro license giveaways, workshops, presentations, sponsorships, speaking opportunities at Unite, and so much more. In those early days, David and Unity understood that fostering grassroots groups of independent developers was essential to planting the seeds of Unity's long-term growth and building toward their goal of democratizing game development for people from all walks of life.
</p>

<p>
We are immensely grateful to David and all the Unity employees who have given their time and effort to support BUG and the broader Unity community.
</p>

<p>
Over the past few years, Unity has unfortunately shifted its focus away from the games industry and away from supporting developer communities. Following the IPO, the company has seemingly put profit over all else, with several acquisitions and layoffs of core personnel. Many key systems that developers need are still left in a confusing and often incomplete state, with the messaging that advertising and revenue matter more to Unity than the functionality game developers care about.
</p>

<p>
Recently, Unity unveiled a set of unthinkably hostile terms of service and pricing changes for its users. The resounding, unequivocal condemnation from the games industry was unprecedented and Unity had no choice but to rescind some of the most egregious changes. Even with these new concessions, the revised pricing model disproportionately affects the success of indie studios in our community.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, we've seen how easily and flippantly an executive-led business decision can risk bankrupting the studios we've worked so hard to build, threaten our livelihoods as professionals, and challenge the longevity of our industry. The Unity of today isn't the same company that it was when the group was founded, and the trust we used to have in the company has been completely eroded. 
</p>

<p>
Since our launch in 2010, the focus of BUG has been first and foremost about supporting developers, not the Unity company. As members of the broader Boston game developer community, we feel our efforts as organizers would be better spent creating opportunities for everyone, not just Unity users. Please join us as we all work together in the larger local development community to continue to host events and presentations for all to enjoy.
</p>

<p>
We encourage our members to join the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/bostongamedev">Boston Game Dev meetup group</a> where they can continue to connect with local developers using Unity, Unreal, Godot and everything in between.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/bostonunitygroup">Boston Unity Group Youtube channel</a> will continue to host recordings of past events.
</p>

<p>
The final BUG meeting will be a social event next Wednesday, September 27th, held on Zoom. We'd like to take the opportunity to thank our community members for their contributions and active support, celebrate the last 13 years, and discuss Boston Game Dev and other groups our members can join to support their endeavors.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the day, it was the thousands of people - participants, speakers, and organizers - who made BUG what it was. As our communities and industry evolve, let's continue to support each other and find new ways to unite.
</p>

<p>
Much love,<br>
Elliott, Chris, and Graham<br>
<i>Boston Unity Group Organizers</i>

  <h2>	Recent Visitor Feedback</h2>
  <div>
    <p>	I just wanted to thank you for your knot (not something I'd ever thought I'd write in an email).</p>
    <p>	Many years back, I was referred to your site from some distant corner of the internet and discovered your “Ian Knot”.
	For the fun of it, I challenged myself to learn this and several other knots, which has been extremely useful more often than I'd have guessed.
	I greatly appreciate the effort you put into not only providing a nice collection of resources, but in making them easy to absorb through diagrams and descriptions.</p>
    <p>	I learned a collection of knots through scouting long ago, but as an avid hiker, the Ian Knot especially has saved time and shoelaces.
	I realized yesterday while teaching knots (including yours) to a group of kids that you may not always see your impact. I'm glad to see that your site it still up,</p>
    <p>	In short, thank you.</p>
    <p>	– Jeremy S., Aug-2023</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>	I hadn't been on the site for quite awhile but just picked up a new “used” pair of sneakers at our local thrift store; so I wanted to give them some groovy lacing method
	(as I do with every lace up shoes I have, since I found you) and I see the new flip option!! Oh how this will help me.
	I'm one of those who doesn't know right from left and up from down. So yeah 🎉😁 and Thanks.</p>
    <p>	P.S. because of you, I learned I had been trying my shoes wrong for over 50 years and never wore lace up athletic shoes
	because they constantly come untied and made the tops of my feet go numb...but now I've learned so much from your site! Thank you thank you thank you</p>
    <p>	– Krista E., Colorado, USA, Aug-2023</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>	First, a big thank you for the nice and useful website. Your shoelace instructions are clear and you present so many different lacing techniques.</p>
    <p>	– Stefan, Germany, Jul-2023</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>	I wanted to find out more about lacing shoes, when I chanced upon your web-site.
	I certainly found what I was looking for, and very pleasantly surprised at the wealth of lacing, and laces, information. It was clearly a labour of love.</p>
    <p>	On reading further, I was moved by how long that you've been doing this, the breadth of your efforts (including a book!), and the app tale of woe.
	Being a chap of a certain age myself (66), and of European extraction too (Switzerland), your tale resonated with me, and I could certainly sympathise.
	So, of course, I wanted to help,  hence the small donation.</p>
    <p>	– Maurice L., Switzerland, Jul-2023</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>	Your site's great; I've used your Mega Ian Shoelace Knot many times. I also use your site as a reference for other things, such as Over Under Lacing,
	whenever I'm too lazy to remember what the amount of eyelets on a given shoe means in terms of starting the lacing.</p>
    <p>	– Larry C., Jul-2023</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>	I use your Website regularly to pair my shoes with the fitting lacing to the style and fit of the shoe.</p>
    <p>	– Serina S., Jul-2023</p>
  </div>

In <a href="http://sainthelenaisland.info/bluebook.htm" type="text/html" title="The ‘Blue Book’: The Annual Colonial Report">The ‘Blue Book’</a> for 1970/3 it is reported that:</p><blockquote>The telephone system now comprises some five route miles of multi-core cable supported on the electricity supply poles and some thirteen and a half route miles of open bare-wire lines on telephone poles. These figures exclude individual service lines. Service in Jamestown and in the adjacent country areas is given from the cable system and it is planned to replace, eventually, all open trunk lines by supported multi-core cables. The present Manual Exchange at <a href="http://sainthelenaisland.info/forts.htm#ladderhillfort" type="text/html" title="Ladder Hill Fort: Forts and Batteries: Defensive military installations">Ladder Hill Fort</a> has a capacity of 120 lines. This Exchange at present controls 65 subscribers on direct lines and 131 subscribers on party lines. There are 52 party lines. The Manual Exchange is very fully loaded and as a result development of the telephone service is restricted. There are at present 11 public telephones available, two in Jamestown and the remainder in the rural areas, from which some 1,400 calls are handled annually.</blockquote><p>The system remained manual until 1983. Due to the shortage of exchange lines, many people used a shared line (‘Party Line’) and there was an ingenious system for the parties to know for whom was an incoming call: one ring for party 1; two rings for party 2; etc., sometimes with as many as five parties sharing a line. The potential for error was immense! This ended when the island’s first automated telephone exchange was commissioned on 16<samp>th</samp>&nbsp;April 1983 at an installation cost of <span id="q_uq5">£100,000</span>. At commissioning the system had 488 active telephones (and a capacity for 600) with three-digit telephone numbers. <a href="http://sainthelenaisland.info/governor.htm#gov059" type="text/html" title="John Dudley Massingham: The Governor of St&nbsp;Helena: The Crown’s representative">Governor Massingham</a> made the first automatically-handled telephone call to George Stevens, Manager of the Government Telephone System.

At this time the three-digit numbers were changed to four digits by adding a 2 for <a href="http://sainthelenaisland.info/jamestown.htm" type="text/html" title="Jamestown: The city where it all happens">Jamestown</a> numbers, a 3 for <a href="http://sainthelenaisland.info/halftreehollow.htm" type="text/html" title="Half Tree Hollow: Home on the hill">Half Tree Hollow</a> and 4 for everywhere else.

These were extreme to the point of being neurotic. They required ships in harbour to unplug aerial wires from their radios and to hang the plug-ends onto the main rigging where they could be clearly seen from the shore, to ensure compliance. Additionally, physical access to the equipment was denied to the crew, the harbour master being given the authority to seal the doors of radio rooms of all ships in harbour.</p><p>The RM Morse Code station was dismantled in 1920, rather than (as might have been more helpful) it being re-deployed for civilian use.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="http://sainthelenaisland.info/rnwirelessstnbadge.gif" alt="Royal Navy Wireless Station, 1940s" width="200" height="181"></p><div><p><span onclick="ImageDisplayPage('communicationsdeadwoodstation1941.jpg','1941 photo ‘Deadwood Station’');"><img loading="lazy" src="http://sainthelenaisland.info/communicationsdeadwoodstation1941_thumb250x120.jpg" alt="1941 photo ‘Deadwood Station’" title="1941 photo ‘Deadwood Station’ @@E@@" width="250" height="120"></span><br><small>1941 photo ‘Deadwood Station’</small><br><span onclick="ImageDisplayPage('communicationsdfdiagram.gif','Direction Finding');"><img loading="lazy" src="http://sainthelenaisland.info/communicationsdfdiagram_thumb250x220.png" alt="Direction Finding" title="Direction Finding @@E@@" width="250" height="220"></span></p></div><h3 id="rnwirelessstationsth">R N Wireless Station, St&nbsp;Helena</h3><p>We know the Royal Navy operated a military radio station on St&nbsp;Helena during <a href="http://sainthelenaisland.info/worldwar2.htm" type="text/html" title="World War 2: St&nbsp;Helena’s part in the global conflict">World War 2</a>.

CS Anglia and CS Britannia carried out this work. To provide an alternative route in case of cable failure another cable laid by CS Anglia in the same year was that from Ascension to Freetown, Sierra Leone, a distance of <ins title="1,125 nm, 1,295 miles">2,085Km</ins>.</p><p>In 1902 the final link in the global network of cables owned and operated by British companies was made with the laying of the Pacific cable from Canada to Australia. The Pacific Cable, jointly owned by the British Government and the Governments of Canada, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, New Zealand, Tasmania and Western Australia in a unique partnership arrangement was, <tt>effected in obedience to the strong desire of the people of the wide-spread British Empire to utilize electricity for the accomplishment of Imperial consolidation</tt>, and to ensure that ‘The All Red Line’ touched only the territories of the British Empire.</p><p>Some parts of the line had been completed considerably earlier. In 1866, the Great Eastern connected Ireland to Newfoundland, by 1870 Suez was linked to Bombay and from there to Madras, Penang and Singapore. Australia was linked to British telegraph cables directly in 1870, by extending a line from Singapore to Port Darwin and by 1872, messages could be sent direct from London to Sydney.</p><p>To complete the network, the final major cable laying project was the trans-Pacific section. The route selected was Bamfield, Vancouver Island - Fanning Island - Fiji - Norfolk Island. From Norfolk Island, two cables would be laid, one to Southport, Queensland, with a landline to Sydney, while the other would land at Doubtless Bay, Auckland and in total <ins title="7,837 nm, 9,000 miles">14,500Km</ins> of cable would be required.</p><p>It was decided to lay the Bamfield-Fanning Island section in one continuous length. At the time no cable ship existed that could carry the cable to do this, so the Telegraph Construction &amp; Maintenance Company had CS Colonia built. Laying of the <ins title="3,459 nm, 4,000 mile">6,400Km</ins> long cable began at Bamfield on 18<samp>th</samp>&nbsp;September 1902, reaching Fanning Island on 6<samp>th</samp>&nbsp;October. Fanning Island had been formally annexed to Great Britain in 1888.</p><p>The CS Anglia which had been used to connect Cape Town and St&nbsp;Helena then laid all the sections from Fanning Island to Australia and New Zealand during 1902.</p><p>The ‘All Red Line’ was inaugurated on 31<samp>st</samp>&nbsp;October 1902 and the Imperial Defence Committee was able to report to the British Government, <tt>The dependence of the United Kingdom on cable stations situated upon foreign territory has been generally eliminated.</tt></p><p>Britain dominated the international cable networks and no other country possessed such an extensive network. In 1896 there were 30 cable-laying ships in the world, 24 of them owned by British companies. The <a href="#easterntelegraph" type="text/html" title="The Eastern Telegraph Company: Communications: Getting the message">Eastern Telegraph Company</a> controlled almost 50 per cent of the world’s submarine cables while other British companies owned another 30 per cent of the cable routes. These figures underestimate the extent of British domination of worldwide telegraphic traffic because, apart from a number of transatlantic cables, most of the submarine cables owned by non-British companies were local links connecting to British long-distance routes.</p><p><i>More about the cable and its history at <a href="https://atlantic-cable.com/Cables/1899StHelena/index.htm" type="text/html" target="_blank" title="atlantic-cable.com:/‌Cables/‌1899StHelena/‌index.htm @@W@@">atlantic-cable.com/‌Cables/‌1899StHelena/‌index.htm</a>.</i></p><p id="q_closinghumourid"><img loading="lazy" src="http://sainthelenaisland.info/smilie.gif" alt="LOL" height="50" width="50"></p><div><p id="q_CreditsList"><em>Credits:</em><br><span><span id="q_i.a" title="Credit {a}@@CH2R@@" onclick="returnFnOrCr();">{a}</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll" type="text/html" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia: Lewis Carroll @@W@@">Lewis Carroll</a>, in ‘Through the Looking Glass’</span><span><span id="q_i.b" title="Credit {b}@@CH2R@@" onclick="returnFnOrCr();">{b}</span>&nbsp;Copyright © <a href="http://sainthelenaisland.info/glossary.htm#sams" type="text/html" title="SAMS: Glossary: Terms used">South Atlantic Media Services Ltd.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-element="story-body" data-subscriber-content=""> <p>Inside the row of workshops in an industrial stretch of Pacoima, men labored over hefty slabs of speckled stone, saws whining over the sounds of Spanish-language rock.</p><p>Pale dust rose around them as they worked. Many went without masks. Some had water spurting from their machines, but others had nothing to tamp down the powder rising in the air. </p><p>“Nobody uses water,” one man in a Dodgers cap said in Spanish when Maria Cabrera approached, holding flyers about silicosis, an incurable and suffocating disease that has devastated dozens of workers across the state and killed men who have barely reached middle age. </p><p>Cabrera, a community outreach worker with the nonprofit Pacoima Beautiful, urged him and others at the Branford Street site to try to protect themselves. Silicosis can ravage<b> </b>the lungs of  workers after they inhale tiny particles of crystalline silica while they cut and grind stone that contains the mineral. </p><p>The disease dates back centuries, but researchers say the booming popularity of countertops made of engineered stone, which has much <a href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/OSHA3768.pdf" target="_blank">higher concentrations of silica</a> than many kinds of natural stone, has driven a new epidemic of an accelerated form of the suffocating illness. As the dangerous dust builds up and scars the lungs, the disease can leave workers short of breath, weakened and ultimately suffering from lung failure. </p><p>“You can get a transplant,” Cabrera told the man in Spanish, “but it won’t last.”</p><p>In California, it has begun to debilitate young workers, largely Latino immigrants who cut and polish slabs of engineered stone. Instead of cropping up in people in their 60s or 70s after decades of exposure, it is now afflicting men in their 20s, 30s or 40s, said Dr. Jane Fazio, a pulmonary critical care physician who became alarmed by cases she saw at Olive View-UCLA Medical Center. Some California patients have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6838a1.htm" target="_blank">died in their 30s</a>.</p><p>“They’re young guys who essentially have a terminal diagnosis,” Fazio said.</p><p>In Pacoima, a 27-year-old father said he now has to hustle home from the park with his 8-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son because his oxygen tank starts to run out as they play. Leobardo Segura Meza said he could no longer run around on the soccer field or exercise the way he used to. </p><p>Nor is he able to work. For a decade, he made a living by cutting, polishing and installing countertops in and around Los Angeles County. Dust was everywhere, he said, and he was given only a dust mask — one he said was inadequate for the job — to protect himself. Sometimes he brought a hose and tried to attach it to the machine to reduce dust, but there were no machines dispensing water as they were cutting, he said.</p><p>He began to suffer a cough that wouldn’t go away and lost his breath when going up stairs, he said. His weight dropped. At one point, he was hospitalized when one of his lungs collapsed. </p><p>Segura Meza had never heard of silicosis before he was diagnosed. “There’s no cure for this illness. The only thing they can do is a lung transplant,” he said in Spanish. </p><p>What he fears, he said, is that as more workers grow ill, “there aren’t enough lungs for us.” At a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAsUzZtipiI" target="_blank">state hearing</a> this summer, Segura Meza said two of his co-workers had already died waiting for transplants. </p><p>To warn workers about the threat, Cabrera and another Pacoima Beautiful outreach worker, Claudia Vasquez, made their rounds at the parking lot of the Home Depot in San Fernando, where laborers in long-sleeve shirts waited for people to drive up and offer them work. Few had heard of the disease.</p><p>“It’s very dangerous, this illness?” asked one man in Spanish, leaning against a palm tree in the parking lot.</p><p>Cabrera told him there was no cure. She urged him to use wet saws to limit any dangerous dust rising in the air and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/index.htm" target="_blank">NIOSH</a>-approved respirators to avoid breathing it in. <a href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/OSHA3768.pdf" target="_blank">Workplace safety regulators</a> have recommended a suite of measures including water spraying systems, ventilation and vacuum systems to clear dust, in addition to protective respirators for workers — ones covering the entire face if silica levels in the air are high.</p><div data-click="enhancement" data-align-center=""><figure> <picture>    <source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9562546/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x4480+0+0/resize/320x213!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9f%2Fad%2F8b94fd564c5680418dfd7d28074c%2F976765-me-0623-veterans-community-va-gem-006.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7f20372/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x4480+0+0/resize/568x379!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9f%2Fad%2F8b94fd564c5680418dfd7d28074c%2F976765-me-0623-veterans-community-va-gem-006.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d53b4c0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x4480+0+0/resize/768x512!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9f%2Fad%2F8b94fd564c5680418dfd7d28074c%2F976765-me-0623-veterans-community-va-gem-006.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/383c48c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x4480+0+0/resize/1024x683!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9f%2Fad%2F8b94fd564c5680418dfd7d28074c%2F976765-me-0623-veterans-community-va-gem-006.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3b00234/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x4480+0+0/resize/1200x800!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9f%2Fad%2F8b94fd564c5680418dfd7d28074c%2F976765-me-0623-veterans-community-va-gem-006.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw">     <img alt="A construction worker sands a kitchen counter." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6b1290f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x4480+0+0/resize/320x213!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9f%2Fad%2F8b94fd564c5680418dfd7d28074c%2F976765-me-0623-veterans-community-va-gem-006.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/af5413b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x4480+0+0/resize/568x379!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9f%2Fad%2F8b94fd564c5680418dfd7d28074c%2F976765-me-0623-veterans-community-va-gem-006.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c33e487/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x4480+0+0/resize/768x512!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9f%2Fad%2F8b94fd564c5680418dfd7d28074c%2F976765-me-0623-veterans-community-va-gem-006.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/043051a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x4480+0+0/resize/1024x683!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9f%2Fad%2F8b94fd564c5680418dfd7d28074c%2F976765-me-0623-veterans-community-va-gem-006.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7c8fd6c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x4480+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9f%2Fad%2F8b94fd564c5680418dfd7d28074c%2F976765-me-0623-veterans-community-va-gem-006.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" width="1200" height="800" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7c8fd6c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x4480+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9f%2Fad%2F8b94fd564c5680418dfd7d28074c%2F976765-me-0623-veterans-community-va-gem-006.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy">  </picture>  <div>   <p>A construction worker sands a kitchen counter inside a unit of Building 207 that is being refurbished as housing for veterans on the Veteran Affairs West LA campus in Los Angeles on June 23, 2022. </p>   <p>(Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times)</p>   </div>  </figure></div><p>The risk is serious for workers in the industry: Although estimates of its prevalence vary from <a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.202008-3297LE" target="_blank">study</a> to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31562234/" target="_blank">study</a>, some <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/health/lung-disease-present-in-20-per-cent-of-queensland-stonemasons/778abf2c-f177-4334-ab9a-e144fd84b232" target="_blank">screenings</a> in Australia have found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10423513/" target="_blank">roughly 1 in 5</a> stone workers had the disease. In California, workplace safety regulators have <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/oshsb/documents/petition-597-CalOSHAeval.pdf" target="_blank">estimated</a> that out of roughly 4,000 workers in the industry across the state, silicosis will afflict between 485 and 848  — and that as many as 161 could ultimately die.</p><p>A recent <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2807615" target="_blank">study</a> by UCLA and UCSF physicians found that among dozens of California workers who got silicosis from grinding countertops, nearly a fifth had died. Their median age at death was 46. More than half had suffered delays in getting diagnosed, as the disease was mistaken for bacterial pneumonia or tuberculosis, and over a third already had severe scarring in their lungs when they were diagnosed.</p><p>Los Angeles County has been an epicenter of the debilitating disease, with 60 out of the 83 cases among countertop workers identified across the state since 2019 by the California Department of Public Health. </p><p>The San Fernando Valley is a hub for the stone “fabrication” industry — those who cut and polish the slabs made by manufacturers — and county officials also said that growing awareness spurred by Fazio and others may have resulted in better reporting of such cases in L.A. In July, the state sent out an advisory to healthcare providers about the threat, recommending that physicians ask  if ailing patients have worked as countertop cutters and urging them to report any identified cases of silicosis to the state.</p><p>California workplace safety regulators are now drafting emergency rules to try to protect workers as engineered stone has come to dominate the countertop industry. The material is also sometimes called artificial or synthetic stone, made with crushed quartz bound together with resin. L.A. County is exploring whether to go further and ban the sale and installation of “silica engineered stone” entirely.</p><p>Existing safety standards must be followed, but “we feel that there need to be additional changes to the standards to make it even more safe in the workplace,” said Dr. Nichole Quick, deputy director of health protection with the L.A. County public health department. </p><p>The county department is now preparing a report requested by county supervisors on<b> </b>options for<b> </b>a potential ban, as well as other possible steps. It has also partnered with Pacoima Beautiful to provide outreach. “This is a preventable disease,” Quick said, “and we want to take appropriate action to make these workplaces safer.”</p><p>One question before the county — and government regulators across the globe — is whether any safeguards will effectively protect workers grinding materials so high in silica. The Agglomerated Stone Manufacturers Assn., an international group representing manufacturers of engineered stone, <a href="https://www.astaworldwide.com/general-statement-engineered-stone-manufacturers-association-a-st-a-world-wide/" target="_blank">maintains</a> its products can be cut “with no safety issues or health hazards if it is performed according to the best practices.” </p><p>In a statement, the association said the risk lies not with engineered stone itself, but poor adherence to safety measures by fabricators, arguing that safety regulations need to be “simplified and rigorously enforced.” Members of the Stone Coalition, which represents fabricators as well as manufacturers, said an L.A. County ban would have “severe economic consequences” and argued for additional enforcement and training on workplace safety, especially efforts to eliminate “dry cutting.” </p><p>And the Los Angeles County Business Federation contended that enforcing safety regulations “will do more to prevent disease, while not adversely [affecting]  the cost of construction at a time when Los Angeles is seeing a devastating housing crisis.”</p><p>But Raphael Metzger, a Long Beach attorney who represents Segura Meza and other workers suing manufacturers of engineered stone such as Cambria and Caesarstone for damages, argued that typical respirators and other standard measures don’t go far enough. Even with many “wet methods,” workers can be exposed to dangerous levels of silica and need additional protection, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/surveyreports/pdfs/2021-DFSE-710.pdf?id=10.26616/NIOSHEPHB2021DFSE710" target="_blank">NIOSH research</a> has found. </p><p>Nearly half of the workers suffering silicosis in the UCLA and UCSF study said their workplaces were using water to control dust. Roughly a quarter said they always had respiratory protection. Fazio said studies have found that in many shops, dust is so thick in the air that respirators cannot filter out a sufficient amount.</p><p>Metzger argued that the kind of sophisticated and costly measures that would be needed to reliably protect workers cutting engineered stone are not economically plausible in an industry where immigrant workers typically labor in small shops and are often paid in cash. Engineered stone “is too dangerous to be used safely,” he said. “If there’s any industrial product that should be banned, this is the product.”</p><p>Segura Meza agreed, calling it “very deadly.” Vasquez, with Pacoima Beautiful, said that when she and Cabrera started talking to workers about engineered stone and silicosis, many of them asked, “How come they don’t do anything with the stores that sell the products?”</p><p>In Australia, where the government is <a href="https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/media-centre/news/closing-soon-consultation-prohibition-use-engineered-stone" target="_blank">weighing whether to ban</a> engineered stone, a professional group whose members assess worker health hazards concluded that the high concentration of silica in engineered stone makes it difficult for measures such as wet cutting and ventilation to adequately protect workers.</p><p>Additional measures for respiratory protection are needed, but such systems “have largely been absent from this sector,” the Australian Institute of Occupational Hygienists wrote. In light of those concerns, it <a href="https://www.aioh.org.au/product/consultation-on-the-prohibition-on-the-use-of-engineered-stone/" target="_blank">recommended</a> prohibiting engineered stone containing more than 10% crystalline silica, but said it would also support banning all engineered stone because of the rigorous compliance needed even at a 10% level.</p><p>In California, existing rules to protect workers have often not been followed, state regulators found. Cal/OSHA, which is now hustling to draft emergency standards to protect California workers in the stone cutting and polishing industry, found rampant violations of the current standards when it looked closer in 2019 and 2020. </p><p>Despite the rise of the deadly disease, homeowners and other consumers shopping for countertops know little about the threat it could pose to the workers behind the surfaces in their kitchens and bathrooms, Fazio said. Engineered stone is now estimated to represent more than 60% of materials used for countertops, the L.A. County business federation said, and market researchers say its popularity is <a href="https://www.freedoniagroup.com/industry-study/engineered-stone-countertops-4395.htm" target="_blank">only expected to rise</a>.</p><p>Engineered stone “is everywhere and people have no idea,” Fazio said. Consumers “have a right to know that the countertop that might be the cheapest one ... may really be costing folks’ lives.”</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apache_Software_Foundation">The Apache Software Foundation</a>
offers a suite of office productivity software named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Open_Office">Apache Open Office</a>.
Based on the <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/download/">download page</a>, you would
never guess the last major release of the software was made available in 2014.</p>
<p>With that bit of release history in mind, would it be fair to consider Apache
Open Office as an un-maintained project? In this blog post, I share a quick
recap of the history behind Apache Open Office, and my opinion on why The
Apache Software Foundation’s actions may be masking the answer to this question.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-beginning-staroffice-was-created">In the beginning, StarOffice was created</h2>
<p>A proprietary office suite was developed in 1985 by a company named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Division">Star Division</a>,
aptly named StarOffice.</p>
<h2 id="the-sun-shined-and-openofficeorg-was-released">The SUN shined, and OpenOffice.org was released</h2>
<p>In the year 2000, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a>
released the source code of StarOffice for free. This resulted in the first
release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a> the following year.</p>
<h2 id="libreoffice-joins-the-party">LibreOffice joins the party</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice">LibreOffice</a> was first released in
2010 based on the OpenOffice.org source code. LibreOffice is actively
maintained by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Document_Foundation">The Document Foundation</a>,
a non-profit created by members of the OpenOffice.org community for the express
purpose of managing and developing LibreOffice.</p>
<h2 id="oracle-gives-openofficeorg-to-the-apache-software-foundation">Oracle gives OpenOffice.org to The Apache Software Foundation</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation">Oracle</a>, having acquired Sun
Microsystems in 2010, now owned the OpenOffice.org trademarks. The year
following the acquisition, Oracle provided the OpenOffice.org trademarks
and any related Oracle-owned code to The Apache Software Foundation in 2011.
This resulted in the creation of Apache Open Office.</p>
<h2 id="apache-open-office-dies-and-refuses-to-leave">Apache Open Office dies, and refuses to leave</h2>
<p>Between its first release with version 3.4 in 2012, and its last major release
with version 4.1 in 2014, Apache Open Office integrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Lotus_Symphony">IBM Lotus Symphony</a>,
after it was donated to The Apache Software Foundation, added a reworked sidebar
and some other new features, as documented in the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/AOO+4.1+Release+Notes">4.1 release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Since 2014… Bug fixes, dictionary updates, bug fixes, dictionary updates,
whitespace “fixes”, dictionary updates, dictionary updates and <strong>did I
mention dictionary updates</strong>!?</p>
<h2 id="things-start-to-get-weird">Things start to get weird</h2>
<p>You might want to sit down before opening the next link. Take a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/apache/openoffice/commits/trunk">apache/openoffice</a> commits
made over the last several years.</p>
<p>What do we find? A lot of commits that don’t actually amount to much at all.
In many cases, the commits <strong>don’t even make any change to the program</strong>,
because they are only changing the blank space that surrounds the source code.</p>
<p>Why would someone do this? Two possible reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are legitimate whitespace issues that need to be addressed.</li>
<li>There is an incentive to make a project appear as though it were active, when it is actually inactive.</li>
</ol>
<p>While the first is fair to assume in most cases, when we look at the list of
commits made to the repository, we find that whitespace changes are not just
part of the commits that Apache Open Office has been receiving, whitespace
changes make up a substantial amount of the commits added to the repository.</p>
<p>Projects become unmaintained every day. This is a fact of life, and is not the
issue I am taking with The Apache Software Foundation. It is the way the
foundation, and its contributors, do not disclose information relating to the
lack of substantial updates or changes for nearly a decade, and seems to
intentionally mask the lack of development.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-can-do-about-it">What we can do about it</h2>
<p>We can tell The Apache Software Foundation that we, as a community of users, do
not support the foundation’s actions in regard to their management of Apache
Open Office. If this blog post motivated you, send an email to <a href="mailto:apache@apache.org">apache@apache.org</a>
saying something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>Apache Open Office has not received substantial updates nor changes in nearly
a decade, yet there is no mention of this anywhere on the download page. In
the best interest of the community, please consider mentioning this
information, as well as providing a link for users to download other actively
maintained office software.</p>
<p>The Apache Open Office GitHub repository receives regular commits, but these
changes seem to largely be whitespace-only. This gives the impression that
the repository is more active than it really is, as non-substantial changes
seem to make up a large number of the commits added. Please archive the
repository if active development has ceased.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>R</span><span>achel Nuwer’s</span> “<a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/i-feel-love-9781635579581/">I Feel Love: MDMA and the Quest for Connection in a Fractured World</a>,” is clearly aimed at a broad audience. It will resonate with readers who have experienced MDMA recreationally, probably at a rave, or therapeutically, probably to heal the emotional aftereffects of deep-seated trauma. Or both. But it’s also intended for readers who have never touched the drug, colloquially known as ecstasy or molly. Perhaps it’s <em>especially </em>for them.</p>



<p>“I Feel Love” belongs to a growing family of nonfiction accounts of the fraught history of psychedelics and why, through compelling anecdotes and the latest science, we should reconsider them. Nuwer, a science journalist, chronicles the hopeful story of something both small and large — MDMA, the compound, and MDMA, the drug that’s repeatedly brought humans together across decades, continents, politics, and moral panics. The book is a natural successor to Michael Pollan’s 2018 bestseller “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/529343/how-to-change-your-mind-by-michael-pollan/">How to Change Your Mind</a>,” which covered the mystical and medical benefits of LSD and psilocybin, and paved the way for a psychedelic renaissance of sorts, Nuwer writes in the introduction, “no such modern telling exists for MDMA.”</p>


<div>
                                    <p><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://undark.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/i-feel-love_1000.jpg"></p><p><a href="https://undark.org/tag/book-reviews/%E2%80%9D">BOOK REVIEW</a><strong> — </strong>“I Feel Love: MDMA and the Quest for Connection in a Fractured World,” by Rachel Nuwer (Bloomsbury Publishing, 384 pages).</p>
			</div>


<p>Now, it does. “I Feel Love” is, above all, a time capsule. Nuwer begins with a crucial asterisk: “MDMA, also known as Ecstasy or Molly, is currently an illegal drug.” Today, most journalism around psychedelics is stipulated with this simple fact. Despite their potential to heal, drugs like psilocybin, LSD, and MDMA are still classified as Schedule I, the Drug Enforcement Administration’s highest category for controlled substances with no medical use, with a high potential for abuse. For MDMA specifically, that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/14/health/mdma-ptsd-psychedelics.html">might be</a> about to change.</p>



<p>A team of researchers that included MAPS Public Benefit Corporation — a company developing prescription psychedelics that arose from the nonprofit Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS, which has been advocating for the legalization of <a href="https://undark.org/2023/08/23/can-mdma-therapy-ease-the-worlds-traumas-critics-arent-sure/">MDMA-assisted therapy</a> since 1986 — published a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02565-4">study</a> on MDMA earlier this month. In it, the researchers suggest that MDMA-assisted therapy is an effective approach for reducing post-traumatic stress disorder. The company plans to submit the results to the Food and Drug Administration, meaning that MDMA, when paired with talk therapy, could potentially be FDA-approved as a treatment for PTSD as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02886-x">early as next year</a>.</p>



<p>In many ways, these recent developments feel like the appropriate ending to “I Feel Love.” “Seemingly overnight, MDMA-assisted therapy has emerged in the popular imagination as a miracle cure for otherwise intractable cases of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in combat veterans, survivors of sexual violence and childhood abuse, and others haunted by past pain,” Nuwer writes.</p>



<p>I’ve found that to be the case in my own reporting — former cult members and sexual assault survivors have told me, with fervor, that MDMA was<em> the thing </em>that healed their trauma. But through meticulous research, Nuwer demonstrates that the therapeutic potential of MDMA wasn’t, in fact, an overnight sensation.</p>



<p>Her sharp retelling of MDMA’s history takes readers from Germany in 1912, where Merck first synthesized the drug, to the United States, when the Army briefly considered it for controversial research into a truth serum. In one fascinating tangent, Nuwer quotes one of her many sources, Nicholas Denomme, now a postdoctoral scholar in psychiatry at Stanford University, who notes that “it would be mind-blowing to know” that a drug that’s poised to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of PTSD in vets was originally used unethically by the military over 70 years ago.</p>


<div>
<figure><blockquote><p>“Seemingly overnight, MDMA-assisted therapy has emerged in the popular imagination as a miracle cure for otherwise intractable cases of post-traumatic stress disorder.”</p></blockquote></figure>
</div>


<p>From there, Nuwer chronicles MDMA’s unfurling as a party drug, with ecstasy displacing cocaine as the drug of choice on the dance floor. In the early 1980s, MDMA meccas unfurled in Dallas, Texas, where the drug brought together a “level of diversity seen nowhere else in the Bible Belt.” By the late 1980s, it was in use throughout the U.K., where it allegedly reduced violence at football matches; it also exploded onto the Dutch party scene, and quickly after, made its way to in Berlin. Today, of course, molly — MDMA’s modern moniker and a nickname for “molecule” —&nbsp;powers music festivals around the world.</p>



<p>While most of the recent science around MDMA focuses on its therapeutic benefits — for <a href="https://undark.org/2023/08/23/can-mdma-therapy-ease-the-worlds-traumas-critics-arent-sure/">PTSD,</a> addiction, depression, anorexia, social anxiety in autistic adults, and traumatic brain injuries, for example — Nuwer shrewdly points out that relatively little research has been directed toward MDMA’s recreational use. “The largest single population of Ecstasy users is probably still young people in music-focused environments, and for many of them, these are among their most treasured and beautiful life experiences,” says Kevin Balktick, the founder of <a href="https://www.horizonspbc.com/">Horizons</a>, an organization that runs a large annual psychedelic conference.</p>



<p>Those treasured and beautiful life experiences are recorded across a spectrum of characters throughout the book. A DJ describes the feeling MDMA invokes as “almost like a religious experience,” one where ecstasy tablets become sacrament. A Vietnam veteran remembers it as an “electric shock to the system.”</p>



<p>A couple in their 70s, who have done MDMA dozens of times, say it’s the “antidote to feeling old: we become ageless for a day.” My favorite descriptor is one Nuwer offers from a friend: “What the rush of joy, elation, and love would feel like if you were suddenly reunited with a good friend you hadn’t seen in years, and you stayed up all night talking because you were so happy to see each other.” (It’s funny; The first time I personally took molly, with a close girlfriend, we were locked in conversation for hours, giggling until the sun came up.)</p>



<p>At several points throughout the book, it starts to feel as if MDMA can do it all. Through Nuwer’s interviews with scientists and activists, we learn that MDMA can solve marital problems, help cancer patients cope with their realities, save years of therapy, and all but eradicate negative emotions. But Nuwer is careful to cut through those shaky claims with breakneck precision, providing an important bulwark against casual hype.</p>

</div>


<p>Nuwer argues throughout the book that the most common effect of MDMA is imparting a feeling of connection. Perhaps MDMA is simply a lens through which to look at human behavior, as it mirrors our innate desire to tinker with consciousness. “Because our tendency to seek out consciousness-altering experiences has withstood the selective pressures of evolution, scientists surmise that there must be benefits,” she writes. “Some of these benefits probably relate to survival: caffeine to keep us alert and enhance our abilities, opium to relieve pain, alcohol to bring us together.”</p>



<p>“But,” she continues, “evidence also indicates that our use of psychoactive substances has shaped us in subtler but perhaps equally powerful ways, by helping mold the customs, beliefs, and traditions that have made our species what it is today.”</p>



<p>Will MDMA save the world? Nuwer denounces that idea in her introduction and repeats the sentiment in many corners of the book. Instead, “I Feel Love” offers a foundation of knowledge that’s perhaps needed to push MDMA to the forefront of mental health through a nonalarmist, honest perspective.</p>



<p>From there, Nuwer lightly suggests that MDMA might potentially be a solvent for the drivers of loneliness and disconnection — caused by the pandemic, our ever-widening political divide, and the isolation of social media — on the individual level. Either way, you may well be tempted to take MDMA immediately after reading this book.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Moving_from_Fandom">https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Moving_from_Fandom</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37644047">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>After <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Moving_from_Fandom/First_discussion" title="Minecraft Wiki:Moving from Fandom/First discussion">several</a> <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Moving_from_Fandom/Second_discussion" title="Minecraft Wiki:Moving from Fandom/Second discussion">discussions</a>, we are excited to announce that the Minecraft Wiki has now moved from Fandom to <b>minecraft.wiki</b> – all of the information about the game can now be found at the new location!
</p><p><br>
By moving to a new place, we are able to bring lots of improvements to the wiki. For example, here are some changes you’ll find when visiting the new wiki!
</p>
<dl><dt>A new skin!</dt>
<dd>No more ugly yellow sidebar! We’ve designed a familiar yet fresh look to the wiki to make it really pop. There’s also a dark mode option (located in the top-right corner of the webpage) and a fixed width option (currently just for logged-in users under “gadgets” in your user settings). We also have a new logo to celebrate!</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Faster load times!</dt>
<dd>Our new host has better built out infrastructure that makes the site load <i>significantly</i> faster than Fandom, especially in different parts of the world and with slower internet connections. This is also thanks to a cleaner website interface that doesn’t require as many resources as the Fandom website does with all its additional non-wiki features.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Fewer ads!</dt>
<dd>The new site won’t have popups, quizzes, unrelated articles or videos ads; only one ad at most will show up per page.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Note that for the moment, there will not be any ads at all as we still work on getting the ad infrastructure fully set up. We will make sure to notify the wiki community and be as transparent as possible about the placement and selection of the ad.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Improved search functionality!</dt>
<dd>You might have noticed that the search results on Fandom are often less than ideal. With our move away from Fandom we’re now able to use a much more powerful and user-friendly search engine again. For example, try to find out which Java snapshot armor trims were added in by searching for “armor trim snapshot”.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>No more age popup!</dt>
<dd>Unlike Fandom, we won’t be forcing you to tell us if you’re a child or an adult.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>Anonymous editing is back!</dt>
<dd>You will no longer need to create an account to help improve the wiki.</dd></dl>
<h2><span id="We_need_your_help!">We need your help!</span></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, because Fandom does not close wikis that have moved away, the old Fandom wiki will remain in place and continue to appear in search results. The old domains “minecraft.gamepedia.com” and “minecraftwiki.net” will still redirect to the Fandom wiki as well.
</p><p>As such, for the new wiki to be successful, we need your help! Here are a few ways you can help out:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Spread the word!</b> Tell your friends that we’ve moved to a new place!</li>
<li><b>Don’t click on Fandom links.</b> In search results, always pick <b>minecraft.wiki</b> links instead of Fandom ones. This tells Google and other search engines which site is better for users.</li>
<li><b>Don't use the old domains.</b> Change any existing “minecraftwiki.net”, “minecraft.gamepedia.com”, or “minecraft.fandom.com” links to <b>minecraft.wiki</b> – this helps us become more established and show up higher in search results.</li>
<li><b>Help improve the wiki!</b> At the new wiki, you don’t even have to create an account to make edits! Need help with editing? Come join our <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href="https://discord.com/invite/fGdE5ZE">Discord server</a> and ask some questions, or check out <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:How_to_help" title="Minecraft Wiki:How to help">this help page</a>.</li></ul>
<p>You can also try out the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href="https://getindie.wiki/">Indie Wiki Buddy</a> browser extension, which will redirect you there automatically, as well as hide the Fandom wiki on Google and other search engines.
</p>
<h2><span id="Migrating_Gamepedia/Fandom_accounts_to_the_new_wiki">Migrating Gamepedia/Fandom accounts to the new wiki</span></h2>
<p>If you’d like to migrate your account to the new wiki, go to <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Special:MigrateUserAccount" title="Special:MigrateUserAccount">this page</a> and follow the steps there. You’ll be prompted to input your name and verify your identity on the Fandom wiki. It should only take a few minutes.
</p><p>All of your previous contributions will be kept when you migrate your account. However your user preferences (including email and talk page signature) unfortunately cannot be transferred and you will need to set them again.
</p><p>In case you have issues with this, please let us know on our <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href="https://discord.com/invite/fGdE5ZE">Discord server</a>.
</p>
<h2><span id="Who_is_hosting_the_new_wiki?">Who is hosting the new wiki?</span></h2>
<p>The new Minecraft Wiki will be hosted by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href="https://weirdgloop.org/">Weird Gloop</a>, the company that hosts the <a href="https://runescape.wiki/">RuneScape wikis</a>. There are a number of reasons why it was chosen as a host, which you can read about on the discussion page <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Moving_from_Fandom/Second_discussion" title="Minecraft Wiki:Moving from Fandom/Second discussion">here</a>.
</p><p>The long and short of it is that our new host has a minimal amount of ads, a strong set of technical infrastructure, lots of transparency, and a strong track record regarding the SEO competition with Fandom for page ranking. Weird Gloop offers us the autonomy we would get from hosting the wiki ourselves, but they also have the experience and expertise needed to set up and maintain the infrastructure behind the wiki, which we do not have ourselves.
</p>
<h2><span id="What_about_the_non-English_wikis?">What about the non-English wikis?</span></h2>
<p>For the moment, only the English Minecraft Wiki has moved away from Fandom. While we are fortunate enough to be able to move, we also understand that not all language wikis are able to or wish to move as well.
</p><p>Some non-English wikis are also planning to move to the new location in the future. However, others have decided to stay at Fandom for now, or are still discussing whether they want to move or not. You can find out what the current position of each wiki is by checking out their respective community portals and/or Discord servers.
</p><p>To all the community, please respect the decisions of those who choose to stay, as we are all still a part of the Minecraft community!
</p>
<h2><span id="Comments_and_discussion">Comments and discussion</span></h2>
<p>If you have any further questions or comments, feel free to put them on the <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki_talk:Moving_from_Fandom" title="Minecraft Wiki talk:Moving from Fandom">discussion page</a>!
