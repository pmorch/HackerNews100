<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article" data-astro-cid-vj4tpspi="">  <p><strong>tl;dr: I’m joining OpenAI to work on bringing agents to everyone. <a href="https://openclaw.ai/">OpenClaw</a> will move to a foundation and stay open and independent.</strong></p>
<p>The last month was a whirlwind, never would I have expected that my playground project would create such waves. The internet got weird again, and it’s been incredibly fun to see how my work inspired so many people around the world.</p>
<p>There’s an endless array of possibilities that opened up for me, countless people trying to push me into various directions, giving me advice, asking how they can invest or what I will do. Saying it’s overwhelming is an understatement.</p>
<p>When I started exploring AI, my goal was to have fun and inspire people. And here we are, the lobster is taking over the world. My next mission is to build an agent that even my mum can use. That’ll need a much broader change, a lot more thought on how to do it safely, and access to the very latest models and research.</p>
<p>Yes, I could totally see how OpenClaw could become a huge company. And no, it’s not really exciting for me. I’m a builder at heart. I did the whole creating-a-company game already, poured 13 years of my life into it and learned a lot. What I want is to change the world, not build a large company and teaming up with OpenAI is the fastest way to bring this to everyone.</p>
<p>I spent last week in San Francisco talking with the major labs, getting access to people and unreleased research, and it’s been inspiring on all fronts. I want to thank all the folks I talked to this week and am thankful for the opportunities.</p>
<p>It’s always been important to me that OpenClaw stays open source and given the freedom to flourish. Ultimately, I felt OpenAI was the best place to continue pushing on my vision and expand its reach. The more I talked with the people there, the clearer it became that we both share the same vision.</p>
<p>The community around OpenClaw is something magical and OpenAI has made strong commitments to enable me to dedicate my time to it and already sponsors the project. To get this into a proper structure I’m working on making it a foundation. It will stay a place for thinkers, hackers and people that want a way to own their data, with the goal of supporting even more models and companies.</p>
<p>Personally I’m super excited to join OpenAI, be part of the frontier of AI research and development, and continue building with all of you.</p>
<p>The claw is the law.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="7eda0c13" data-element_type="widget" data-e-type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
					<p>A bloc of 40 state and territorial attorneys general is urging Congress to adopt the Senate’s version of the controversial <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/kids-online-safety-act-kosa-privacy-surveillance-concerns-2025">Kids Online Safety Act</a>, positioning it as the stronger regulatory instrument and rejecting the House companion as insufficient.</p>
<p>The Act would kill online anonymity and tie online activity and speech to a real-world identity.</p>
<p>Acting through the National Association of Attorneys General, the coalition sent a letter to congressional leadership endorsing S. 1748 and opposing H.R. 6484.</p>
<p><strong>We obtained a copy of the letter for you <a href="https://docs.reclaimthenet.org/ag-letter-supporting-senate-kosa-february-10-2026.pdf">here</a>.</strong></p><div data-id="eb333a5" data-element_type="container" data-e-type="container" data-settings="{&quot;background_background&quot;:&quot;classic&quot;}" data-elementor-type="section" data-elementor-id="235992" data-elementor-post-type="elementor_library">

					</div>

<p>Their request centers on structural differences between the bills. The Senate proposal would create a federally enforceable “Duty of Care” requiring covered platforms to mitigate defined harms to minors.</p>
<p>Enforcement authority would rest with the Federal Trade Commission, which could investigate and sue companies that fail to prevent minors from encountering content deemed to cause “harm to minors.”</p>
<p>That framework would require regulators to evaluate internal content moderation systems, recommendation algorithms, and safety controls.</p>
<p>S. 1748 also directs the Secretary of Commerce, the FTC, and the Federal Communications Commission to study “the most technologically feasible methods and options for developing systems to verify age at the device or operating system level.”</p>
<p>This language moves beyond platform-level age gates and toward infrastructure embedded directly into hardware or operating systems.</p>
<p>Age verification at that layer would not function without some form of credentialing. Device-level verification would likely depend on digital identity checks tied to government-issued identification, third-party age verification vendors, or persistent account authentication systems.</p>
<p>That means users could be required to submit identifying information before accessing broad categories of lawful online speech.&nbsp;Anonymous browsing depends on the ability to access content without linking identity credentials to activity.</p>
<p>A device-level age verification architecture would establish identity checkpoints upstream of content access, creating records that age was verified and potentially associating that verification with a persistent device or account.</p>
<p>Even if content is not stored, the existence of a verified identity token tied to access creates a paper trail.</p>
<p>Constitutional questions follow. The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized anonymous speech as protected under the First Amendment. Mandating identity verification before accessing lawful speech raises prior restraint and overbreadth concerns, particularly where the definition of “harm to minors” extends into categories that are legal for adults.</p>
<p>Courts have struck down earlier <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/texas-app-store-accountability-act-blocked-federal-judge-first-amendment">efforts to impose age verification requirements</a> for online content on First Amendment grounds, citing the chilling effect on lawful expression and adult access.</p>
<p>Despite this history, state officials continue to advocate for broader age verification regimes. Several states have enacted or proposed laws requiring age checks for social media or adult content sites, often triggering litigation over compelled identification and privacy burdens.</p>
<p>The coalition’s letter suggests that state attorneys general are not retreating from that position and are instead seeking federal backing.</p>
<p>The attorneys general argue that social media companies deliberately design products that draw in underage users and monetize their personal data through targeted advertising. They contend that companies have not adequately disclosed addictive features or mental health risks and point to evidence suggesting firms are aware of adverse consequences for minors.</p>
<p>Multiple state offices have already filed lawsuits or opened investigations against Meta and TikTok, alleging “harm” to young users.</p>
<p>At the same time, the coalition objects to provisions in H.R. 6484 that would limit state authority. The House bill contains broader federal preemption language, which could restrict states from enforcing parallel or more stringent requirements. The attorneys general warn that this would curb their ability to pursue emerging online harms under state law. They also fault the House proposal for relying on company-maintained “reasonable policies, practices, and procedures” rather than imposing a statutory Duty of Care.</p>
<p>The Senate approach couples enforceable federal standards with preserved state enforcement power.</p>
<p>The coalition calls on the United States House of Representatives to align with the Senate framework, expand the list of enumerated harms to include even suicide, eating disorders, compulsive use, mental health harms, and financial harms, and ensure that states retain authority to act alongside federal regulators. The measure has bipartisan sponsorship in the United States Senate.</p>
<p>The policy direction is clear. Federal agencies would study device-level age verification systems, the FTC would police compliance with harm mitigation duties, and states would continue to pursue parallel litigation. Those mechanisms would reshape how platforms design their systems and how users access speech.</p>
<p>Whether framed as child protection or platform accountability, the architecture contemplated by S. 1748 would move identity verification closer to the heart of internet access.</p>
<p>Once age checks are embedded at the operating system level, the boundary between verifying age and verifying identity becomes difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>The internet would be changed forever.</p>

          <p>On Friday afternoon, Ars Technica published <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/">an article</a> containing fabricated quotations generated by an AI tool and attributed to a source who did not say them. That is a serious failure of our standards. Direct quotations must always reflect what a source actually said.</p>
<p>That this happened at Ars is especially distressing. We have covered the risks of overreliance on AI tools for years, and our written policy reflects those concerns. In this case, fabricated quotations were published in a manner inconsistent with that policy. We have reviewed recent work and have not identified additional issues. At this time, this appears to be an isolated incident.</p>
<p>Ars Technica does not permit the publication of AI-generated material unless it is clearly labeled and presented for demonstration purposes. That rule is not optional, and it was not followed here.</p>
<p>We regret this failure and apologize to our readers. We have also apologized to Mr. Scott Shambaugh, who was falsely quoted.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p><span>New York City’s</span> public hospital system is paying millions to Palantir, the controversial ICE and military contractor, according to documents obtained by The Intercept.</p>
<p>Since 2023, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation has paid Palantir nearly $4 million to improve its ability to track down payment for the services provided at its hospitals and medical clinics. Palantir, a data analysis firm that’s now a Wall Street giant thanks to its lucrative work with the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence community, deploys its software to make more efficient the billing of Medicaid and other public benefits. That includes automated scanning of patient health notes to “Increase charges captured from missed opportunities,” contract materials reviewed by The Intercept show.</p>
<p>Palantir’s administrative involvement in the business of healing people stands in contrast to its longtime role helping facilitate warfare, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/03/02/palantir-provides-the-engine-for-donald-trumps-deportation-machine/">mass deportations</a>, and dragnet surveillance.</p>
<p>In 2016, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/02/22/how-peter-thiels-palantir-helped-the-nsa-spy-on-the-whole-world/">The Intercept revealed</a> Palantir’s role behind XKEYSCORE, a secret NSA bulk surveillance program revealed by the whistleblower Edward Snowden that allowed the U.S. and its allies to search the unfathomably large volumes of data they collect. The company has also attracted global scrutiny and criticism for its “<a href="https://www.palantir.com/assets/xrfr7uokpv1b/3MuEeA8MLbLDAyxixTsiIe/9e4a11a7fb058554a8a1e3cd83e31c09/C134184_finaleprint.pdf">strategic partnership</a>” with the Israeli military while it was leveling Gaza.</p>

<p>But it’s Palantir’s work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that is drawing the most protest today. The company provides a variety of services to help the federal government find and deport immigrants. ICE’s Palantir-furnished case management software, for example, “plays a critical role in supporting the daily operations of ICE, ensuring critical mission success,” according to federal contracting documents.</p>
<p>“It’s unacceptable that the same company that is targeting our neighbors for deportation and providing tools to the Israeli military is also providing software for our hospitals,” said Kenny Morris, an organizer with the American Friend Service Committee, which shared the contract documents with The Intercept.</p>

<p>Established by the state legislature, New York City Health and Hospitals is the nation’s biggest municipal health care system, administering over 70 facilities throughout New York City, including Bellevue Hospital, and providing care for over 1 million New Yorkers annually.</p>
<p>New York City Health and Hospitals spokesperson Adam Shrier did not respond to multiple requests to discuss the contract’s details. Palantir spokesperson Drew Messing said the company does not use or share hospital data outside the bounds of its contract.</p>
<p>Palantir’s contract with New York’s public health care system allows the company to work with patients’ protected health information, or PHI. With permission from New York City Health and Hospitals, Palantir can “de-identify PHI and utilize de-identified PHI for purposes other than research,” the contract states. De-identification generally involves the stripping of certain revealing information, such as names, Social Security numbers, and birthdays. Such provisions are common in contracts involving health data.</p>
<p>Activists who oppose Palantir’s involvement in New York point to a large body of research that indicates re-identifying personal data, including in medial contexts, is <a href="https://georgetownlawtechreview.org/re-identification-of-anonymized-data/GLTR-04-2017/">often</a> <a href="https://techscience.org/a/2017082801/">trivial</a>.</p>
<p>“Any contract that shares any of New Yorkers’ highly personal data from NYC Health &amp; Hospital’s with Palantir, a key player in the Trump administration’s mass deportation effort, is reckless and puts countless lives at risk,” said Beth Haroules of the New York Civil Liberties Union. “Every New Yorker, without exception, has a right to quality healthcare and city services. New Yorkers must be able to seek healthcare without fear that their intimate medical information, or immigration status, will be delivered to the federal government on a silver platter.”</p>

<p>Palantir has long provided similar services to the U.K. National Health Service, a business relationship that today has an increasing number of detractors. Palantir “has absolutely no place in the NHS, looking after patients’ personal data,” Green Party leader Zack Polanski recently stated in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2026/feb/05/calls-to-halt-uk-palantir-contracts-grow-amid-lack-of-transparency-over-deals">letter to the U.K. health secretary</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Palantir is targeting the exact patients that NYCHH is looking to serve.” </p>
</blockquote>
</figure>
<p>Some New York-based groups feel similarly out of distrust for what the firm could do with troves of sensitive personal data.</p>
<p>“Palantir is targeting the exact patients that NYCHH is looking to serve,” said Jonathan Westin of the Brooklyn-based organization Climate Organizing Hub. “They should immediately sever their contract with Palantir and stand with the millions of immigrant New Yorkers that are being targeted by ICE in this moment.”</p>
<p>“The chaos Palantir is inflicting through its technology is not just limited to the kidnapping of our immigrant neighbors and the murder of heroes like our fellow nurse, Alex Pretti,” said Hannah Drummond, an Asheville, North Carolina-based nurse and organizer with National Nurses United, a nursing union. “As a nurse and patient advocate, I don’t want anything having to do with Palantir in my hospital — and neither should any elected leader who claims to represent nurses.”</p>
<p>Palantir’s vocally right-wing CEO Alex Karp&nbsp;has been a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/11/08/alex-karp-palantir-democrats-mamdani">frequent</a> critic <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6384521232112">of New York City’s</a> newly inaugurated democratic socialist Mayor Zohran Mamdani. Health and Hospitals operates as a public benefit corporation, but the mayor can exert considerable influence over the network, for instance through the appointment of its board of directors. Its president, Dr. Mitchell Katz, was <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/ocme/news/cm1025/mayor-elect-mamdani-renominates-nyc-health-hospitals-president-ceo-dr-mitchell-katz-and">renominated</a> by Mamdani, then the mayor-elect, late last year.</p>
<p>The mayor’s office did not respond in time for publication when asked about its stance on the contract.<a id="_msocom_1"></a></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news/new-eu-rules-stop-destruction-unsold-clothes-and-shoes-2026-02-09_en">https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news/new-eu-rules-stop-destruction-unsold-clothes-and-shoes-2026-02-09_en</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47025378">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The European Commission today (Feb 9) adopted new measures under the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) to prevent the destruction of unsold apparel, clothing, accessories and footwear.</p><p>The rules will help cut waste, reduce environmental damage and create a level playing field for companies embracing sustainable business models, allowing them to reap the benefits of a more circular economy.</p><p>Every year in Europe, an estimated<strong> 4-9% of unsold textiles</strong> are destroyed before ever being worn. This waste generates around <strong>5.6 million tons</strong> of CO2 emissions – almost equal to Sweden’s total net emissions in 2021.</p><p>To help reduce this wasteful practice, the ESPR requires companies to disclose information on the unsold consumer products they discard as waste. It also introduces a ban on the destruction of unsold apparel, clothing accessories and footwear.</p><p>The Delegated and Implementing Acts adopted today will support businesses in complying with these requirements by:</p><ul><li><strong>Clarifying derogations</strong>: The Delegated Act outlines specific and justified circumstances under which the destruction will be permitted, for instance, due to safety reasons or product damage. National authorities will oversee compliance.</li><li><strong>Facilitating disclosure:</strong> The Implementing Act introduces a standardised format for businesses to disclose the volumes of unsold consumer goods they discard. This applies from February 2027, giving businesses sufficient time to adapt.</li></ul><p>Instead of discarding stock, companies are encouraged to manage their stock more effectively, handle returns, and explore alternatives such as resale, remanufacturing, donations, or reuse.</p><p>The ban on destruction of unsold apparel, clothing accessories and footwear and the derogations will apply to large companies from <strong>19 July 2026.</strong> Medium-sized companies are expected to follow in 2030. The rules on disclosure under the ESPR <strong>already apply</strong> <strong>to large companies</strong> and will also apply to medium-sized companies in 2030.</p><blockquote><p>"The textile sector is leading the way in the transition to sustainability, but there are still challenges. The numbers on waste show the need to act. With these new measures, the textile sector will be empowered to move towards sustainable and circular practices, and we can boost our competitiveness and reduce our dependencies."</p><p><strong>Jessika Roswall, Commissioner for Environment, Water Resilience and a Competitive Circular Economy</strong></p></blockquote><h4><strong>Background</strong></h4><p>The destruction of unsold goods is a wasteful practice. In France alone, around €630 million worth of unsold products are destroyed each year. Online shopping also fuels the issue: in Germany, nearly 20 million returned items are discarded annually.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Textiles are a major part of the problem, and a key focus for action. To cut waste and reduce the sector’s environmental footprint, the European Commission is promoting more sustainable production while helping European companies stay competitive.&nbsp;</p><p>The ESPR is central to this effort. It will make products on the EU market more durable, reusable and recyclable, while boosting efficiency and circularity.</p><h5><strong>More information</strong></h5><p><a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/commission-delegated-regulation-setting-out-derogations-prohibition-destruction-unsold-consumer_en">Delegated Regulation setting out derogations from the prohibition of destruction of unsold consumer products | European Commission</a></p><p><a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/commission-implementing-regulation-details-and-format-disclosure-information-discarded-unsold_en">Implementing Regulation on the details and format for the disclosure of information on discarded unsold consumer products | European Commission</a></p><p><a href="https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/ecodesign-sustainable-products-regulation_en">Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation | European Commission</a></p><p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R1781&amp;qid=1719580391746">Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation | EUR-Lex</a></p><p><a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/textiles-strategy_en">Textiles strategy | European Commission</a></p><p><a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/publications/the-destruction-of-returned-and-unsold-textiles-in-europes-circular-economy">The destruction of returned and unsold textiles in Europe’s circular economy | European Environment Agency (EEA)</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

          <!-- RSPEAK_START -->

        

        <p>Palantir Technologies, the US provider of analytics software, finds itself directly affected by two reports from the Swiss online magazine "Republik". After the company unsuccessfully demanded a counterstatement from the magazine, it now wants to enforce one through legal action. It's about a factual comparison, says the software provider. The "Republik" creators appear surprised.</p>
<!-- RSPEAK_STOP -->




  


<!-- RSPEAK_START -->

<h3 id="nav_streisand_effect_0">Streisand Effect</h3>
<p>With the step to court, Palantir has generated more attention for the "Republik" reporting than the objected articles themselves could have caused – 23 years after Barbra Streisand <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Barbra-Streisand-klagt-gegen-Homepage-Betreiber-79921.html?from-en=1">triggered the effect named after her</a>. And yet, there are reasons why Palantir is acting this way.</p>
<p>While in Germany the provider of data linking and data analysis software for authorities with surveillance powers is successful with at least some state customers. The company has so far had – as far as is known – little state clientele in Switzerland.</p>
<p>In December, "Republik" <a href="https://www.republik.ch/2025/12/08/wie-hartnaeckig-palantir-die-schweiz-umwarb">extensively quoted from Swiss administration files</a>. According to this, Palantir repeatedly sought contact with Swiss authorities – and found it. In some cases, it originated from Palantir, in others, likely from public bodies. The matters concerned the military, police, and health authorities. However, no business deal was apparently concluded.</p>
<p>Palantir feels unfairly treated by the reporting on this. "We can confirm that an application for a counterstatement has been filed with the Commercial Court in this matter," the communications officer of the Cantonal High Court told heise online on Friday upon request.</p>
<h3 id="nav_swiss__1">Swiss Counterstatements</h3>
<p>Swiss law provides for counterstatements, meaning that as soon as a request for a counterstatement has been rejected by a medium, a civil court can examine the matter and hear both sides. The Commercial Court of Zurich is responsible here. The Commercial Court of Zurich is responsible here.</p>

<!-- RSPEAK_START -->

<p>Palantir says it had to sue to uphold its legal claim. "Palantir fully respects press freedom and the essential role of independent media in public debate," said a company spokeswoman. The right to a counterstatement is a "correction instrument intended to provide the public with balanced information."</p>
<p>For Palantir, the "Republik" reporting came at an inopportune time. This is because important procurement decisions are currently being made in several business areas in many European countries: the modernization and expansion of military, intelligence, and secret services, as well as police authorities, would be a promising business for Palantir and its software, which is also helpful for official surveillance.</p>
<p>In its home market, the USA, the company does business with US federal authorities for about a quarter of a billion US dollars, according to transparency data <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/recipient/1ea8a9a4-3726-3491-9040-66950bb67606-C/latest">approximately a quarter of a billion US dollars</a>. Customers include the US Department of Defense, the Army, and the FBI. The company reports nearly 4.5 billion US dollars in revenue for 2025, about a tenth of SAP's annual revenue. And yet, Palantir is valued on the stock market at around 300 billion euros, while SAP comes in at around 200 billion.</p>
<h3 id="nav_difficult__2">Difficult Terrain Europe</h3>
<p>The European market remains difficult terrain for Palantir. The connection to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), <a href="https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/USA-Die-Architektur-der-Abschiebung-und-Palantirs-Rolle-im-neuen-ICE-System-11152960.html?from-en=1">which is supposed to track down illegal migrants with brutal methods and a lot of high-tech</a>, causes consternation in Europe. As a US company, Palantir is subject to US law, which increasingly questions international cooperation in security matters – this is unlikely to be conducive to sales for Palantir.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the uproar had just subsided elsewhere: Palantir was criticized for its involvement in Israel. Founders Peter Thiel and Alex Karp had agreed to a strategic partnership with the Israeli Ministry of Defense in January 2024, Bloomberg reported at the time. The report on this is <a href="https://www.palantir.com/assets/xrfr7uokpv1b/3MuEeA8MLbLDAyxixTsiIe/9e4a11a7fb058554a8a1e3cd83e31c09/C134184_finaleprint.pdf">publicly available on the Palantir website</a>.</p>
<p>The small medium from Switzerland is hardly comparable to industry giants like Bloomberg. It has been published ad-free and exclusively online since 2018. It is primarily supported by a good 30,000 subscribers, a majority of whom are also cooperative members with voting rights. Not a media behemoth with a large publisher behind it.</p>
<h3 id="nav__borderline__3">"Borderline Conspiracy Theories"</h3>
<p>Shortly after the publication of the two articles now being heard in court, Courtney Bowman, head of Palantir's "Privacy and Civil Liberties" department, had already set the course on LinkedIn: The reports from "Republik" were "full of distortions, insinuations, and borderline conspiracy theories."</p>
<p>Bowman accuses the authors of having reproduced a report from the Swiss Army Staff too uncritically – whose authors, unfortunately, had "relied on a limited set of search engine hit sources." The Palantir representative, in turn, provided no evidence for his claims.</p>
<p>"I believe we have done excellent research and documented it very comprehensively," says Daniel Binswanger, co-editor-in-chief of "Republik," in an interview with heise online. Research based on Swiss government documents is one of the "best foundations for reporting." He is very confident about the outcome of the proceedings.</p>

<h3 id="nav_palantir__4">Palantir Rejects Accusation of Intimidation</h3>
<p>Palantir strongly rejects the impression that a multi-billion dollar company is flexing its muscles against a small magazine: Any accusation that this is a strategic attempt to intimidate unfavorable reporting through legal action is unfounded, the company spokeswoman emphasizes: "Palantir merely seeks the publication of a concise and appropriate counterstatement to correct significant inaccuracies."</p>
<p>However, the company does not disclose what specific "significant inaccuracies" Palantir wants to see corrected. Palantir did not respond to a request to send the "corrections" specifically demanded by "Republik" by Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Whether the company will achieve at least partial success with its approach in court is hardly predictable. The Swiss right to a counterstatement involves no examination by the court whether a statement was actually correct. This is why it is a frequently used form in the Swiss media world when companies feel they have been misrepresented.</p>
<p>"The right to a counterstatement is not about whether something is true or false," explains "Republik" co-editor-in-chief Daniel Binswanger. "It's about whether another version of the facts could also be possible." However, this only concerns factual representation. Opinions, on the other hand, are not challengeable in Switzerland either.</p>
<p>For the Swiss online magazine, however, the effect is noticeable and measurable. "We are overwhelmed," says Daniel Binswanger in an interview with heise online. "The offers of donations, expressions of solidarity – it's gigantic," he says. "We've never experienced a story triggering this." Ms. Streisand sends her regards.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content_body"><p><span>Hideki Sato, the designer behind virtually every Sega console, and the company’s former president, has died age 77.</span></p><p><span>Japanese games outlet <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://x.com/beep2021/status/2022662105904877996?s=46">Beep21 </a>reports that Sato passed away this weekend.</span></p><p><span>Sato and his R&amp;D team were responsible for the creation of <a title="Companies > Sega [1,106 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/companies/sega/">Sega</a>’s arcade and home console hardware, including the Master System, Genesis / Mega Drive, Saturn, and Dreamcast.</span></p><p><span>The engineer joined Sega in 1971 and was the company’s acting president between 2001 and 2003. He left the company in 2008.</span></p><p><span>“From the beginning, Sega’s home console development has always been influenced by our arcade development,” Sato previously told <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shmuplations.com/segahistory/">Famitsu</a> in an interview covering Sega’s history.</span></p><p><span>“Our first 8-bit machine was the </span><span>SC-3000</span><span>. This was a <a title="Platforms > PC [11,949 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/platforms/pc/">PC</a> for beginner-level users. At that time, Sega only did arcade games, so this was our first challenge. We had no idea how many units we’d sell.”</span></p><p><span>Sato said of Mega Drive, Sega’s most successful console: “At that point, we decided to start developing a new home console. By then, arcade games were using 16-bit CPUs. </span></p><p><span>“Arcade development was something we were very invested in, so we were always using the most cutting-edge technology there. Naturally, it started us thinking: what if we used that technology in a home console? </span></p><p><span>“Two years after we started development, it was done: a 16-bit CPU home console, the Megadrive. The 68000 chip had also recently come down in price, so the timing was right.”</span></p><p><span>On Dreamcast, the release that ultimately ended Sega’s run in hardware, Sato said the keyword for the development was “play and communication.”</span></p><p><span>“The ultimate form of communication is a direct connection with another, and we included the modem and the linkable VMUs for that purpose,” he said. </span></p><p><span>“We had also planned to have some sort of linking function with cell phones, but we weren’t able to realize it. Consumers were now used to the raging ‘bit wars’, so even though we knew it was a lot of nonsense, we needed to appeal to them in those terms with the Dreamcast. </span></p><p><span>“And so we marketed it as having a ‘128 bit graphics engine RISC CPU’, even the SH-4 was only 64-bit. (laughs) On the other hand, we extensively customized the original SH-4 for the Dreamcast, to the point where I think you could almost call it something new.”</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

While the picture that emerges is grim, to put it mildly, at least Americans are again confronted with crystal clarity over how severe this has become.</span></p><p><span>The latest round of valid panic over privacy began during the Super Bowl held on Sunday. During the game, Amazon ran </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OheUzrXsKrY" rel="">a commercial</a><span> for its Ring camera security system. The ad manipulatively exploited people’s love of dogs to induce them to ignore the consequences of what Amazon was touting. It seems that trick did not work.</span></p><p>The ad highlighted what the company calls its “Search Party” feature, whereby one can upload a picture, for example, of a lost dog. Doing so will activate multiple other Amazon Ring cameras in the neighborhood, which will, in turn, use AI programs to scan all dogs, it seems, and identify the one that is lost. The 30-second commercial was full of heart-tugging scenes of young children and elderly people being reunited with their lost dogs.</p><p>But the graphic Amazon used seems to have unwittingly depicted how invasive this technology can be. That this capability now exists in a product that has long been pitched as nothing more than a simple tool for homeowners to monitor their own homes created, it seems, an unavoidable contrast between public understanding of Ring and what Amazon was now boasting it could do.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0JUB!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0JUB!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0JUB!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0JUB!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0JUB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0JUB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png" width="2424" height="1243" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1243,&quot;width&quot;:2424,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5364048,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://greenwald.substack.com/i/187789911?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd64d01cc-601f-4649-bf9d-c537edb2bff8_2968x1522.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0JUB!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0JUB!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0JUB!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0JUB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82e6327a-fa3c-4292-b929-8f1c12444f41_2424x1243.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>Amazon’s Super Bowl ad for Ring and its “Search Party” feature.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Many people were not just surprised but quite shocked and alarmed to learn that what they thought was merely their own personal security system now has the ability to link with countless other Ring cameras to form a neighborhood-wide (or city-wide, or state-wide) surveillance dragnet. That Amazon emphasized that this feature is available (for now) only to those who “opt-in” did not assuage concerns.</p><p><span>Numerous media outlets sounded the alarm. The online privacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) </span><a href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/ring-flock-partnership-amazon-scraps-surveillance-company-safety-super-bowl-commercial-backlash/18596207/" rel="">condemned</a><span> Ring’s program as previewing “a world where biometric identification could be unleashed from consumer devices to identify, track, and locate anything — human, pet, and otherwise.”</span></p><p><span>Many private citizens who previously used Ring also reacted negatively. “Viral videos online show people removing or destroying their cameras over privacy concerns,” </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2026/02/10/ring-super-bowl-ad-dog-camera-privacy/88606738007/" rel="">reported</a><span> USA Today. The backlash became so severe that, just days later, Amazon — seeking to assuage public anger — </span><a href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/ring-flock-partnership-amazon-scraps-surveillance-company-safety-super-bowl-commercial-backlash/18596207/" rel="">announced</a><span> the termination of a partnership between Ring and Flock Safety, a police surveillance tech company (while Flock is unrelated to Search Party, public backlash made it impossible, at least for now, for Amazon to send Ring’s user data to a police surveillance firm).</span></p><p>The Amazon ad seems to have triggered a long-overdue spotlight on how the combination of ubiquitous cameras, AI, and rapidly advancing facial recognition software will render the term “privacy” little more than a quaint concept from the past. As EFF put it, Ring’s program “could already run afoul of biometric privacy laws in some states, which require explicit, informed consent from individuals before a company can just run face recognition on someone.”</p><p>Those concerns escalated just a few days later in the context of the Tucson disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, mother of long-time TODAY Show host Savannah Guthrie. At the home where she lives, Nancy Guthrie used Google’s Nest camera for security, a product similar to Amazon’s Ring.</p><p><span>Guthrie, however, did not pay Google for a subscription for those cameras, instead solely using the cameras for real-time monitoring. As CBS News </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cybersecurity-experts-nancy-guthrie-surveillance-footage-recovery/" rel="">explained</a><span>, “with a free Google Nest plan, the video should have been deleted within 3 to 6 hours — long after Guthrie was reported missing.” Even professional privacy advocates have understood that customers who use Nest without a subscription will not have their cameras connected to Google’s data servers, meaning that no recordings will be stored or available for any period beyond a few hours.</span></p><p><span>For that reason, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2026/02/11/privacy-concerns-nancy-guthrie-google-nest-camera-footage-kidnapping/" rel="">announced</a><span> early on “that there was no video available in part because Guthrie didn’t have an active subscription to the company.” Many people, for obvious reasons, prefer to avoid permanently storing comprehensive daily video reports with Google of when they leave and return to their own home, or who visits them at their home, when, and for how long.</span></p><p>Despite all this, FBI investigators on the case were somehow magically able to “recover” this video from Guthrie’s camera many days later. FBI Director Kash Patel was essentially forced to admit this when he released still images of what appears to be the masked perpetrator who broke into Guthrie’s home. (The Google user agreement, which few users read, does protect the company by stating that images may be stored even in the absence of a subscription.)</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OWb9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OWb9!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OWb9!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OWb9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OWb9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OWb9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png" width="920" height="642" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:642,&quot;width&quot;:920,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:689574,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://greenwald.substack.com/i/187789911?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OWb9!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OWb9!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OWb9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OWb9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36f93214-f835-4323-841f-53de4ae5f0ce_920x642.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>Image obtained through Nancy Guthrie’s unsubscribed Google Nest camera and released by the FBI.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>While the “discovery” of footage from this home camera by Google engineers is obviously of great value to the Guthrie family and law enforcement agents searching for Guthrie, it raises obvious yet serious questions about why Google, contrary to common understanding, was storing the video footage of unsubscribed users. A former NSA data researcher and CEO of a cybersecurity firm, Patrick Johnson, told CBS: “There's kind of this old saying that data is never deleted, it's just renamed.”</p><p><strong>It is rather remarkable that</strong><span> Americans are being led, more or less willingly, into a state-corporate, Panopticon-like domestic surveillance state with relatively little resistance, though the widespread reaction to Amazon’s Ring ad is encouraging. Much of that muted reaction may be due to a lack of realization about the severity of the evolving privacy threat. Beyond that, privacy and other core rights can seem abstract and less of a priority than more material concerns, at least until they are gone.</span></p><p>It is always the case that there are benefits available from relinquishing core civil liberties: allowing infringements on free speech may reduce false claims and hateful ideas; allowing searches and seizures without warrants will likely help the police catch more criminals, and do so more quickly; giving up privacy may, in fact, enhance security.</p><p>But the core premise of the West generally, and the U.S. in particular, is that those trade-offs are never worthwhile. Americans still all learn and are taught to admire the iconic (if not apocryphal) 1775 words of Patrick Henry, which came to define the core ethos of the Revolutionary War and American Founding: “Give me liberty or give me death.” It is hard to express in more definitive terms on which side of that liberty-versus-security trade-off the U.S. was intended to fall.</p><p><span>These recent events emerge in a broader context of this new Silicon Valley-driven destruction of individual privacy. Palantir’s federal contracts for domestic surveillance and domestic data management continue to expand rapidly, with more and more intrusive data about Americans consolidated under the control of this </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JypG_o7HWT0" rel="">one sinister corporation</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Facial recognition technology — now fully in use for an array of purposes from Customs and Border Protection at airports to ICE’s patrolling of American streets — means that fully tracking one’s movements in public spaces is easier than ever, and is becoming easier by the day. It was only three years ago that we </span><a href="https://x.com/systemupdate_/status/1712828792320778590" rel="">interviewed</a><span> </span><em>New York Times</em><span> reporter Kashmir Hill about her new book, “Your Face Belongs to Us.” The warnings she issued about the dangers of this proliferating technology have not only come true with startling speed but also appear already beyond what even she envisioned.</span></p><p>On top of all this are advances in AI. Its effects on privacy cannot yet be quantified, but they will not be good. I have tried most AI programs simply to remain abreast of how they function.</p><p>After just a few weeks, I had to stop my use of Google’s Gemini because it was compiling not just segregated data about me, but also a wide array of information to form what could reasonably be described as a dossier on my life, including information I had not wittingly provided it. It would answer questions I asked it with creepy, unrelated references to the far-too-complete picture it had managed to create of many aspects of my life (at one point, it commented, somewhat judgmentally or out of feigned “concern,” about the late hours I was keeping while working, a topic I never raised).</p><p>Many of these unnerving developments have happened without much public notice because we are often distracted by what appear to be more immediate and proximate events in the news cycle. The lack of sufficient attention to these privacy dangers over the last couple of years, including at times from me, should not obscure how consequential they are.</p><p><span>All of this is particularly remarkable, and particularly disconcerting, since we are barely more than a decade removed from the disclosures about mass domestic surveillance enabled by the courageous whistleblower Edward Snowden. Although most of our reporting focused on state surveillance, one of </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data" rel="">the first stories</a><span> featured the joint state-corporate spying framework built in conjunction with the U.S. security state and Silicon Valley giants.</span></p><p><span>The Snowden stories sparked years of anger, attempts at reform, changes in diplomatic relations, and even genuine (albeit forced) </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/technology/end-to-end-encryption.html" rel="">improvements</a><span> in Big Tech’s user privacy. But the calculation of the U.S. security state and Big Tech was that at some point, attention to privacy concerns would disperse and then virtually evaporate, enabling the state-corporate surveillance state to march on without much notice or resistance. At least as of now, the calculation seems to have been vindicated.</span></p></div></article></div><div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div><div><h3>Ready for more?</h3></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine you’re maintaining a native project. You use Visual Studio for building on Windows, so you do the responsible thing and list it as a dependency</p><blockquote><p>Build Requirements: Install Visual Studio</p></blockquote><p>If you’re lucky enough not to know this yet, I envy you.  Unfortunately, at this point even Boromir knows…</p><figure><img src="https://marler8997.github.io/SimplyInstallVs.png">
<figcaption>Well put Boromir</figcaption></figure><p>What you may not realize is, you’ve actually signed up to be unpaid tech support for Microsoft’s “Visual Studio Installer”. You might notice GitHub Issues becoming less about your code and more about broken builds, specifically on Windows. You find yourself explaining to a contributor that they didn’t check the “Desktop development with C++” workload, but specifically the v143 build tools and the 10.0.22621.0 SDK. No, not that one, the <em>other</em> one. You spend less time on your project because you’re too busy being a human-powered dependency resolver for a 50GB IDE.</p><p>Saying “Install Visual Studio” is like handing contributors a choose-your-own-adventure book riddled with bad endings, some of which don’t let you go back. I’ve had to re-image my entire OS more than once over the years.</p><h3>Why is this tragedy unique to Windows?</h3><p>On <strong>Linux</strong>, the toolchain is usually just a package manager command away. On the other hand, “Visual Studio” is thousands of components. It’s so vast that Microsoft distributes it with a sophisticated GUI installer where you navigate a maze of checkboxes, hunting for which “Workloads” or “Individual Components” contain the actual compiler. Select the wrong one and you might lose hours installing something you don’t need. Miss one, like “Windows 10 SDK (10.0.17763.0)” or “Spectre-mitigated libs,” and your build fails three hours later with a cryptic error like <code>MSB8101</code>. And heaven help you if you need to downgrade to an older version of the build tools for a legacy project.</p><p>The Visual Studio ecosystem is built on a legacy of ‘all-in-one’ monoliths. It conflates the editor, the compiler, and the SDK into a single, tangled web. When we list ‘Visual Studio’ as a dependency, we’re failing to distinguish between the tool we use to write code and the environment required to compile it.</p><p>The pain compounds quickly:</p><ul><li><strong>Hours-long waits</strong>: You spend an afternoon watching a progress bar download 15GB just to get a 50MB compiler.</li><li><strong>Zero transparency</strong>: You have no idea which files were installed or where they went. Your registry is littered with cruft and background update services are permanent residents of your Task Manager.</li><li><strong>No version control</strong>: You can’t check your compiler into Git. If a teammate has a slightly different Build Tools version, your builds can silently diverge.</li><li><strong>The “ghost” environment</strong>: Uninstalling is never truly clean. Moving to a new machine means repeating the entire GUI dance, praying you checked the same boxes.</li></ul><p>Even after installation, compiling a single C file from the command line requires finding the Developer Command Prompt. Under the hood, this shortcut invokes <code>vcvarsall.bat</code>, a fragile batch script that globally mutates your environment variables just to locate where the compiler is hiding this week.</p><p>Ultimately, you end up with build instructions that look like a legal disclaimer:</p><blockquote><p>“Works on my machine with VS 17.4.2 (Build 33027.167) and SDK 10.0.22621.0. If you have 17.5, please see Issue #412. If you are on ARM64, godspeed.”</p></blockquote><p>On Windows, this has become the “cost of doing business”. We tell users to wait three hours for a 20GB install just so they can compile a 5MB executable. <strong>It’s become an active deterrent to native development</strong>.</p><h2>A new way</h2><p>I’m not interested in being a human debugger for someone else’s installer. I want the MSVC toolchain to behave like a modern dependency: versioned, isolated, declarative.</p><p>I spent a few weeks building an open source tool to make things better. It’s called <a href="https://github.com/marler8997/msvcup" target="_blank">msvcup</a>. It’s a small CLI program. On good network/hardware, it can install the toolchain/SDK in a few minutes, including everything to cross-compile to/from ARM. Each version of the toolchain/SDK gets its own isolated directory. It’s idempotent and fast enough to invoke every time you build. Let’s try it out.</p><p>Create <code>hello.c</code> and <code>build.bat</code>:</p><pre><code><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span>() { <span>printf</span>(<span>"Hello, World\n"</span>)<span>;</span> }
</code></pre>
<pre><code>@setlocal

@if not exist msvcup.exe (
    echo msvcup.exe: installing...
    curl -L -o msvcup.zip https://github.com/marler8997/msvcup/releases/download/v2026_02_07/msvcup-x86_64-windows.zip
    tar xf msvcup.zip
    del msvcup.zip
) else (
    echo msvcup.exe: already installed
)
@if not exist msvcup.exe exit /b 1

set MSVC=msvc-14.44.17.14
set SDK=sdk-10.0.22621.7

msvcup install --lock-file msvcup.lock --manifest-update-off %MSVC% %SDK%
@if %errorlevel% neq 0 (exit /b %errorlevel%)

msvcup autoenv --target-cpu x64 --out-dir autoenv %MSVC% %SDK%
@if %errorlevel% neq 0 (exit /b %errorlevel%)

.\autoenv\cl hello.c
</code></pre><p>And we’re done.</p><p>Believe it or not, this <code>build.bat</code> script replaces the need to “Install Visual Studio”. This script should run on any Windows system since Windows 10 (assuming it has curl/tar which have been shipped since 2018). It installs the MSVC toolchain, the Windows SDK and then compiles our program.</p><p>For my fellow Windows developers, go ahead and take a moment. Visual Studio can’t hurt you anymore. The <code>build.bat</code> above isn’t just a helper script; it’s a declaration of independence from the Visual Studio Installer. Our dependencies are fully specified, making builds reproducible across machines. And when those dependencies are installed, they won’t pollute your registry or lock you into a single global version.</p><p>Also note that after the first run, the <code>msvcup</code> commands take milliseconds, meaning we can just leave these commands in our build script and now we have a fully self-contained script that can build our project on virtually any modern Windows machine.</p><h2>How?</h2><p>msvcup is inspired by a <a href="https://gist.github.com/mmozeiko/7f3162ec2988e81e56d5c4e22cde9977" target="_blank">small Python script</a> written by Mārtiņš Možeiko. The key insight is that Microsoft publishes JSON manifests describing every component in Visual Studio, the same manifests the official installer uses. msvcup parses these manifests, identifies just the packages needed for compilation (the compiler, linker, headers, and libraries), and downloads them directly from Microsoft’s CDN. Everything lands in versioned directories under <code>C:\msvcup\</code>. For details on lock files, cross-compilation, and other features, see the <a href="https://github.com/marler8997/msvcup" target="_blank">msvcup README.md</a>.</p><p>The astute will also notice that our <code>build.bat</code> script never sources any batch files to set up the “Developer Environment”. The script contains two msvcup commands. The first installs the toolchain/SDK, and like a normal installation, it includes “vcvars” scripts to set up a developer environment. Instead, our <code>build.bat</code> leverages the <code>msvcup autoenv</code> command to create an “Automatic Environment”. This creates a directory that contains wrapper executables to set the environment variables on your behalf before forwarding to the underlying tools. It even includes a <code>toolchain.cmake</code> file which will point your CMake projects to these tools, allowing you to build your CMake projects outside a special environment.</p><p>At <a href="https://tuple.app/" target="_blank">Tuple</a> (a pair-programming app), I integrated msvcup into our build system and CI, which allowed us to remove the requirement for the user/CI to pre-install Visual Studio. Tuple compiles hundreds of C/C++ projects including WebRTC. This enabled both x86_64 and ARM builds on the CI as well as keeping the CI and everyone on the same toolchain/SDK.</p><p>The benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Everything installs into a versioned directory.</strong> No problem installing versions side-by-side. Easy to remove or reinstall if something goes wrong.</li><li><strong>Cross-compilation enabled out of the box.</strong> msvcup currently always downloads the tools for all supported cross-targets, so you don’t have to do any work looking for all the components you need to cross-compile.</li><li><strong>Lock file support.</strong> A self-contained list of all the payloads/URLs. Everyone uses the same packages, and if Microsoft changes something upstream, you’ll know.</li><li><strong>Blazing fast.</strong> The <code>install</code> and <code>autoenv</code> commands are idempotent and complete in milliseconds when there’s no work to do.</li></ul><p>No more “it works on my machine because I have the 2019 Build Tools installed.” No more registry-diving to find where <code>cl.exe</code> is hiding this week. With msvcup, your environment is defined by your code, portable across machines, and ready to compile in milliseconds.</p><h3>Limitations</h3><p>msvcup focuses on the core compilation toolchain. If you need the full Visual Studio IDE, MSBuild-based project systems, or components like the C++/CLI compiler, you’ll still need the official installer. For most native development workflows, though, it covers what you actually need.</p><h2>A Real-World Example: Building Raylib</h2><p>Let’s try this on a real project. Here’s a script that builds <a href="https://github.com/raysan5/raylib" target="_blank">raylib</a> from scratch on a clean Windows system. In this case, we’ll just use the SDK without the autoenv:</p><pre><code>@setlocal

set TARGET_CPU=x64

@if not exist msvcup.exe (
    echo msvcup.exe: installing...
    curl -L -o msvcup.zip https://github.com/marler8997/msvcup/releases/download/v2026_02_07/msvcup-x86_64-windows.zip
    tar xf msvcup.zip
    del msvcup.zip
)

set MSVC=msvc-14.44.17.14
set SDK=sdk-10.0.22621.7

msvcup.exe install --lock-file msvcup.lock --manifest-update-off %MSVC% %SDK%
@if %errorlevel% neq 0 (exit /b %errorlevel%)

@if not exist raylib (
    git clone https://github.com/raysan5/raylib -b 5.5
)

call C:\msvcup\%MSVC%\vcvars-%TARGET_CPU%.bat
call C:\msvcup\%SDK%\vcvars-%TARGET_CPU%.bat

cmd /c "cd raylib\projects\scripts &amp;&amp; build-windows"
@if %errorlevel% neq 0 (exit /b %errorlevel%)

@echo build success: game exe at:
@echo .\raylib\projects\scripts\builds\windows-msvc\game.exe
</code></pre><p>No Visual Studio installation. No GUI. No prayer. Just a script that does exactly what it says.</p><p>P.S. <a href="https://marler8997.github.io/build-zig/windows.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is a page that shows how to use msvcup to build LLVM and Zig from scratch on Windows.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/fast-llm-inference/">https://www.seangoedecke.com/fast-llm-inference/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47022329">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header></header><section><p><a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/fast-mode">Anthropic</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex-spark/">OpenAI</a> both recently announced “fast mode”: a way to interact with their best coding model at significantly higher speeds.</p>
<p>These two versions of fast mode are very different. Anthropic’s <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/fast-mode#how-fast-mode-works">offers</a> up to 2.5x tokens per second (so around 170, up from Opus 4.6’s 65). OpenAI’s offers more than 1000 tokens per second (up from GPT-5.3-Codex’s 65 tokens per second, so 15x). So OpenAI’s fast mode is six times faster than Anthropic’s<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, Anthropic’s big advantage is that they’re serving their actual model. When you use their fast mode, you get real Opus 4.6, while when you use OpenAI’s fast mode you get GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark, not the real GPT-5.3-Codex. Spark is indeed much faster, but is a notably less capable model: good enough for many tasks, but it gets confused and messes up tool calls in ways that vanilla GPT-5.3-Codex would never do.</p>
<p>Why the differences? The AI labs aren’t advertising the details of how their fast modes work, but I’m pretty confident it’s something like this: <strong>Anthropic’s fast mode is backed by <em>low-batch-size</em> inference, while OpenAI’s fast mode is backed by special monster Cerebras chips</strong>. Let me unpack that a bit.</p>
<h3>How Anthropic’s fast mode works</h3>
<p>The tradeoff at the heart of AI inference economics is <em>batching</em>, because the main bottleneck is <em>memory</em>. GPUs are very fast, but moving data onto a GPU is not. Every inference operation requires copying all the tokens of the user’s prompt<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> onto the GPU before inference can start. Batching multiple users up thus increases overall throughput at the cost of making users wait for the batch to be full.</p>
<p>A good analogy is a bus system. If you had zero batching for passengers - if, whenever someone got on a bus, the bus departed immediately - commutes would be much faster <em>for the people who managed to get on a bus</em>. But obviously overall throughput would be much lower, because people would be waiting at the bus stop for hours until they managed to actually get on one.</p>
<p>Anthropic’s fast mode offering is basically a bus pass that guarantees that the bus immediately leaves as soon as you get on. It’s six times the cost, because you’re effectively paying for all the other people who could have got on the bus with you, but it’s way faster<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> because you spend <em>zero</em> time waiting for the bus to leave.</p>
<p>edit: I want to thank a reader for emailing me to point out that the “waiting for the bus” cost is really only paid for the first token, so that won’t affect <em>streaming</em> latency (just latency per turn or tool call). It’s thus better to think of the performance impact of batch size being mainly that smaller batches require fewer flops and thus execute more quickly. In my analogy, maybe it’s “lighter buses drive faster”, or something.</p>
<p>Obviously I can’t be fully certain this is right. Maybe they have access to some new ultra-fast compute that they’re running this on, or they’re doing some algorithmic trick nobody else has thought of. But I’m pretty sure this is it. Brand new compute or algorithmic tricks would likely require changes to the model (see below for OpenAI’s system), and “six times more expensive for 2.5x faster” is right in the ballpark for the kind of improvement you’d expect when switching to a low-batch-size regime.</p>
<h3>How OpenAI’s fast mode works</h3>
<p>OpenAI’s fast mode does not work anything like this. You can tell that simply because they’re introducing a new, worse model for it. There would be absolutely no reason to do that if they were simply tweaking batch sizes. Also, they told us in the announcement <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex-spark/">blog post</a> exactly what’s backing their fast mode: Cerebras.</p>
<p>OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/cerebras-partnership/">announced</a> their Cerebras partnership a month ago in January. What’s Cerebras? They build “ultra low-latency compute”. What this means in practice is that they build <em>giant chips</em>. A H100 chip (fairly close to the frontier of inference chips) is just over a square inch in size. A Cerebras chip is <em>70</em> square inches.</p>

    </span></p>
<p>You can see from pictures that the Cerebras chip has a grid-and-holes pattern all over it. That’s because silicon wafers this big are supposed to be broken into dozens of chips. Instead, Cerebras etches a giant chip over the entire thing.</p>
<p>The larger the chip, the more internal memory it can have. The idea is to have a chip with SRAM large enough <em>to fit the entire model</em>, so inference can happen entirely in-memory. Typically GPU SRAM is measured in the tens of <em>megabytes</em>. That means that a lot of inference time is spent streaming portions of the model weights from outside of SRAM into the GPU compute<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>. If you could stream all of that from the (much faster) SRAM, inference would a big speedup: fifteen times faster, as it turns out!</p>
<p>So how much internal memory does the latest Cerebras chip have? <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2503.11698v1#:~:text=Most%20recently%2C%20the%20Wafer%20Scale,of%2021%20petabytes%20per%20second.">44GB</a>. This puts OpenAI in kind of an awkward position. 44GB is enough to fit a small model (~20B params at fp16, ~40B params at int8 quantization), but clearly not enough to fit GPT-5.3-Codex. That’s why they’re offering a brand new model, and why the Spark model has a bit of “small model smell” to it: it’s a smaller <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_distillation">distil</a> of the much larger GPT-5.3-Codex model<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>OpenAI’s version is much more technically impressive</h3>
<p>It’s interesting that the two major labs have two very different approaches to building fast AI inference. If I had to guess at a conspiracy theory, it would go something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>OpenAI partner with Cerebras in mid-January, obviously to work on putting an OpenAI model on a fast Cerebras chip</li>
<li>Anthropic have no similar play available, but they know OpenAI will announce some kind of blazing-fast inference in February, and they want to have something in the news cycle to compete with that</li>
<li>Anthropic thus hustles to put together the kind of fast inference they <em>can</em> provide: simply lowering the batch size on their existing inference stack</li>
<li>Anthropic (probably) waits until a few days before OpenAI are done with their much more complex Cerebras implementation to announce it, so it looks like OpenAI copied them</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously OpenAI’s achievement here is more technically impressive. Getting a model running on Cerebras chips is not trivial, because they’re so weird. Training a 20B or 40B param distil of GPT-5.3-Codex that is still kind-of-good-enough is not trivial. But I commend Anthropic for finding a sneaky way to get ahead of the announcement that will be largely opaque to non-technical people. It reminds me of OpenAI’s mid-2025 sneaky introduction of the Responses API to help them <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/responses-api">conceal their reasoning tokens</a>.</p>
<h3>Is fast AI inference the next big thing?</h3>
<p>Seeing the two major labs put out this feature might make you think that fast AI inference is the new major goal they’re chasing. I don’t think it is. If my theory above is right, Anthropic don’t care <em>that</em> much about fast inference, they just didn’t want to appear behind OpenAI. And OpenAI are mainly just exploring the capabilities of their new Cerebras partnership. It’s still largely an open question what kind of models can fit on these giant chips, how useful those models will be, and if the economics will make any sense.</p>
<p>I personally don’t find “fast, less-capable inference” particularly useful. I’ve been playing around with it in Codex and I don’t like it. The usefulness of AI agents is dominated by <em>how few mistakes they make</em>, not by their raw speed. Buying 6x the speed at the cost of 20% more mistakes is a bad bargain, because most of the user’s time is spent handling mistakes instead of waiting for the model<sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, it’s certainly possible that fast, less-capable inference becomes a core lower-level primitive in AI systems. Claude Code already uses <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1098#issuecomment-2884244872">Haiku</a> for some operations. Maybe OpenAI will end up using Spark in a similar way.</p>

  <h3>Semantic, minimal, zero dependencies. ~8KB CSS and JS.</h3>

  <p>
    Oat is an ultra-lightweight HTML + CSS, semantic UI component library with zero dependencies.
    No framework, build, or dev complexity. Just include the tiny CSS and JS files and you are good to go building
    decent looking web applications with most commonly needed components and elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Semantic tags and attributes are styled contextually out of the box without classes, forcing best practices, and reducing
    markup class pollution. A few dynamic components are WebComponents and use minimal JavaScript.

  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>
    This was made after the unending frustration with the over-engineered bloat, complexity, and dependency-hell of pretty much every Javascript UI library and framework out there. Done with the continuous PTSD of rug-pulls and lockins of the Node.js ecosystem trash.
    <sup><a href="https://nadh.in/blog/javascript-ecosystem-software-development-are-a-hot-mess/">[1]</a></sup>
    I've published this, in case other Node.js ecosystem trauma victims find it useful.
  </p>
  <p>
    My goal is a simple, minimal, vanilla, standards-based UI library that I can use in my own projects for the long term without having to worry about Javascript ecosystem trash. Long term because it's just simple vanilla CSS and JS.
    The look and feel are influenced by the shadcn aesthetic.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Last week, I helped build Super Bowl activations for DraftKings, Bud Light, and Spotify, turning San Francisco into a vice-centric Disneyland for the rich and famous. It was plastic. It was loud. It was profitable.</p><p>On Wednesday, I traveled from Berkeley to the Tenderloin. The rain was rushing down as I exited the Civic Center BART Station. I walked past the Main Library and water started filling my shoe through a hole I didn’t know existed. My sock got heavy. My foot got damp. Is there anything quite as awful?</p><p>The discomfort catapulted me back.</p><p><strong>March 2025.</strong></p><p>I stepped off a Greyhound into the shadow of the Salesforce Tower. It is the second tallest tower on the West Coast. It’s a giant glass needle that penetrates the clouds. Sometimes it looks the eye of Sauron. It’s a monument to a corporation that monetizes human connection. It is a machine that measures a human being’s worth based on how much money they can make you.</p><p>I arrived at its base with no money, no phone, and an empty backpack.</p><p>Time was ticking. The sky was gray. I didn’t want to sleep on the ground, or venture to the airport, or have to nod off on short bus routes that ended at nowheres in the middle of the night.</p><p>I walked up Market Street to the Main Library. As I sat in front of the computer, it was the first time I truly acknowledged the harsh truth I had been avoiding: I was homeless.</p><p>I found a list of shelters. I started with what I believed to be the nicest one.</p><p><em>Dignity Moves</em><span> on Gough Street. Seventy private rooms. A staff member looked at me through the fence as if I was an invasive species. He told me there was no one to talk to. I had to call The SFHOT line. I had to wait for the van to pick me up and drop me off where they find fit.</span></p><p>“I am in front of you right now,” I said. “I am a person. I don’t have a phone. I don’t want a phone. I am here. I am tired. This is a shelter. I need shelter.”</p><p>“Can’t help you.” he said.</p><p>He walked away. I walked away. Did dignity move?</p><p><span>I drifted south to SOMA. I passed a tent handing out clean needles. I thought of Huxley’s </span><em>Brave New World</em><span>. Soma: the government-produced drug for artificial happiness. An opiate for the masses. I arrived at the next shelter. They asked if I was an addict. I told them I had a couple beers in a couple months. </span></p><p>“This place is only for addicts,” they said. “Try the Human Services Agency.”</p><p>Sobriety was the disqualifier. And the Human Services Agency? The name felt wrong. Like how aliens might describe us. Or a department in a Kafka story.</p><p>It was getting close to dark. I went back to the library. I sat down in front of the computer again and found a temporary shelter a few blocks away at the Quaker’s Meeting Hall on 9th Street.</p><p>I joined the line. These were odd folks. I suppose I was an odd folk, too. A woman with purple hair held a clipboard like a shield. She pointed a thermometer at my head.</p><p>“Ninety-four degrees.”</p><p>“What?” I asked.</p><p>She wrote it down.</p><p>“Shouldn’t it be 97 or 98?”</p><p>“No. Ninety-four.”</p><p>She didn’t recognize the disconnect. I looked at her ledger. The temperatures ranged from eighty-eight to ninety-five.</p><p>It reaffirmed a delusion that had previously gripped my mind and begun my psychosis; I must be dead. This place, purgatory. I prayed for a quest or that my retribution was almost over, so that I could go back to land of the living.</p><p>I entered the hall.</p><p>The old lady’s came marching in, and fed us pasta and bread and cake and cookies. There was Coca Cola. I ate because I had no choice, but suspicious of the sugar they forced on us. We slept on green mats. Most of the folks, drenched theirs in Industrial Clorox. I thought they had it wrong. Embrace the filth.  Do you trust the chemicals?</p><p>At 8:05 PM, the lights died. I had no blue light. I had no screen. Just exhaustion and the collective breathing of fifty souls. Tired souls. Hurting souls. I slept as deep as you can until 5:30 AM.</p><p>The morning crew felt like NPCs (for those older folks, an NPC is a character in a video game that is scripted or run by AI). This morning crew was Sneakerheads. Starbucks and Air Force Ones, tracksuits and the chit chat of urban culture. I wonder how much they were getting paid?</p><p>One man marched in every morning and kept repeating, “Drago! Drago! Drago!” at an invisible enemy in the air. They brought French toast in white containers. Some of the people around me drenched theirs in mountains of maple syrup. Is sugar the enemy?</p><p>Out by 7am. I entered Mission Mode. Survival is a series of small, concrete objectives.</p><p>Find a shower. Find laundry. Find food.</p><p>There was a shelter in the Mission that offered laundry and showers on Tuesdays, but only for women.</p><p>“I identify as a woman,” I said.</p><p>She smiled. She said ok. You are smart. The gate opened.</p><p>I sat with some older women who knitted and shared some pizza. I looked around. I had a small breath of relief.</p><p>“Your turn.” I had five minutes to shower. I shaved too fast and cut my face. I watched the blood mix with the water.</p><p>I had found a shower. I had found laundry. I had food. Missions accomplished. I went back to the Quaker’s Meeting Hall that evening.</p><p>In the margins of the day, I started reading a lot and building a website for time travelers. I thought I might be able to communicate that way.</p><p>One day, I went to the St. Vincent’s clothing pantry. I tried on Miami Vice-like Hawaiian shirts that felt like Grand Theft Auto outfits. However after a few blocks with my new clothes, I decided they must be cursed.  Filled with the bad energy of their previous owners. I wore them 30 or so blocks. And donated my new clothes at a Goodwill. I stuck to my original avatar. Jeans and a Marine Layer hoodie. </p><p><span>I needed a guide. I stole </span><em>Don Quixote</em><span> from the library.</span></p><p>One night, in the Quaker Meeting Hall, I thought I found my Sancho Panza: an older Chinese man who waddled with three plastic bags filled with Pringles containers.  I don’t know what he did during the day. Or why he always carried those plastic bags. Or why the contents of those plastic bags never changed.  I thought we might be knights.</p><p>The end of March happened and so did the temporary shelter. I needed to find a new place.</p><p>I remembered a place in San Mateo I rejected back in February. It hadn’t crossed my mind when I first arrived back in San Francisco. When I had been offered it in February, I rejected the offer because I thought it was ludicrous to think I was homeless. I come from a relatively privileged upbringing, and the idea of homelessness was a distant concept to my naive brain.</p><p><em>Now that I was beginning to land in reality,</em></p><p>I hopped on the Cal Train to Redwood City and walked to LifeMoves Navigation Center. They accepted me for a night but said I needed an official recommendation from the Human Service Agency to stay. I would do it after my court case the next morning.</p><p><strong>April 2nd, 2025</strong></p><p>I stood in a courtroom. Four felonies.</p><p>My public defender reminded me of a woman I did ayahuasca with in upstate New York. But she didn’t like me the same as the ayahuasca friend.  She hadn’t responded to my emails. She was never in her office. I didn’t like the lack of communication.</p><p>I told her I wanted to represent myself.</p><p>She looked at me like I was insane. “You might not even be allowed to represent yourself.”</p><p>If there is one thing to know about me, it’s this: as soon as the words, “You can’t” or “You aren’t allowed” are spoken - especially when there is objective truth- it becomes my mission to prove the right way, to prove a truth. Purpose endowed.</p><p>The judge looked down from the bench. “Are you sure? If convicted, you could spend three to five years in prison.”</p><p>“I am sure,” I said. “I am capable. I understand the charges. I understand the possibility of the consequences. And I understand the process. I want to represent myself.”</p><p>She said, “Ok. I’ll see you at the end of the month.”</p><p>I walked out of the courtroom, a homeless felon acting as his own attorney.</p><p>I took the Caltrain back to Redwood City. I went to the library. I saw the email from my mom.</p><p><em>Your grandma passed away this morning.</em></p><p>Twenty-two days in hospice. Supposedly she broke the record in that hospice. She couldn’t die without winning.</p><p>I went to the Human Services Agency in Redwood City. My paranoia of the place had dissipated slightly as the idea of having my own room felt pretty nice. But they denied me from the LifeMoves Navigation Center. Instead they offered me a bed in a room with twenty men in Menlo Park. She pointed to 3 guys who were missing their teeth and I summed them up to be probable meth users. </p><p>“You can join them. I’m calling them an Uber right now.”</p><p>“No,” I said.</p><p>I was done with barracks and shared rooms in homeless shelters. I walked out.</p><p>I walked into a Savers. I didn’t have money. Since that 94 degree reading, I had refused to steal, convinced I was in purgatory and doing the “right thing” was the only way to pass the test. But standing there, the rules dissolved.  The moral guardrails of our broken systems suddenly felt absurd. Today, survival wasn’t a sin. It was a step in this journey. I felt a wink from my grandma. </p><p>I took a sleeping bag, and a Thermos. I walked out.</p><p>I walked into a Sports Basement. I grabbed a portable stove and a small propane tank.</p><p>I walked into a Safeway and grabbed some taro roots, tortillas, beans, and a steak.</p><p>I found a bridge in Redwood City. Concrete. Brutalist. A bit damp.</p><p>I unrolled my sleeping bag in the dirt. The moon came up. A raccoon walked on the other side of the river. I turned on the mini propane tank, cut and cooked the taro, the steak, and the beans - and made myself some delicious steak tacos.</p><p>A couple months ago, I found that particular bridge was next to an office building inhabited by some of my old colleagues. A start-up I had been a part of in New York. Where I was the first employee. I had owned equity. They had eventually sold for $350 million. At that moment, they were raising $140 million to build robots for the future.</p><p>And here I was, a man facing felony charges, homeless, penniless, sleeping in the dirt just a stone’s throw away from a future that could have been. </p><p>It was funny.</p><p>I closed my eyes. I could defend myself. I could fend for myself. I could survive.</p></div></article></div><div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div><div><h3>Ready for more?</h3></div></div></div>]]></description>

The Founders Fund began in the mid-2000s and made key early investments in the likes of SpaceX, AirBNB, OpenAI and Polymarket. All your favorite tech things “disrupting” the modern world.

Why, none other than your friend and mine, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hulk-hogan-sex-tape-gawker-lawsuit-kotaku-go-media-1851787000">the anti-humanist, antichrist-awaiting Thiel</a>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Thiel, of course, is known for many things. A co-founder of PayPal, Thiel is now more closely affiliated with Palantir, a company specializing in digital surveillance and exploiting user information.

Flashpoint Archive is a community effort to preserve games and animations from the web.</p><p>

Internet history and culture is important, and the web is evolving at such a rapid pace that what might be commonplace today could be obsolete tomorrow. This project is dedicated to preserving as many experiences from these platforms as possible, so that they aren't lost to time. Since December 2017, <a href="https://flashpointproject.github.io/flashpoint-database/statistics/">over 200,000 games and animations</a> have been preserved across more than a hundred browser plugins and web technologies.</p><p>

In addition to our preservation efforts, we also provide a highly flexible software package for reliable navigation and playback of preserved content. Among the software that powers Flashpoint is <a href="https://github.com/FlashpointProject/launcher">a fully-featured launcher</a> that acts as a frontend for the collection, <a href="https://github.com/FlashpointProject/FlashpointProxy">a proxy</a> that tricks games into thinking they're running on the live web, and <a href="https://github.com/FlashpointProject/FlashpointSecureTools">a sandbox</a> that allows for secure playback of plugin-enabled content - all of which are <a href="https://flashpointarchive.org/source">open-source software</a>.</p>

</p><p>

The project <a href="https://flashpointarchive.org/news#starting-date">was originally started</a> by BlueMaxima in an attempt to outrun the disappearance of webgames prior to the death of Flash. It has since evolved into a major undertaking involving hundreds of community contributors from around the world, encompassing both games and animations created for numerous internet plugins, frameworks, and standards.</p><p>

Flashpoint Archive operates as non-profit with the goal of furthering efforts in the preservation and accessibility of games, animations and other digital interactive experiences from the web. If you wish to support us or find out more about how we're funded and where these funds are spent, please use the Donate button in the left sidebar or visit our <a href="https://opencollective.com/flashpointarchive">Open Collective page</a>.
