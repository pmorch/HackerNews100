<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="md-content"><h2>FSE Meets the FBI!</h2><p>I have for you a bizarre tale of scrapers, feds, data poisoning, Torswats, and everyone's favorite fedi instance.  It veers technical, because I suspect it will be of interest to other people running servers with UGC (i.e., every fedi instance), and also because the mechanics of how I figured out what I figured out might be useful.  It's also got information about how the FBI collects data, which is of interest to everyone, but especially US citizens.  I have a few pieces of the puzzle, maybe someone with interlocking pieces can say more; I'm happy to compare notes.
</p>
<p>To summarize, the FBI pays some shady companies to scrape data, the data is scanned for keywords (yep, just like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivore_%28software%29">CARNIVORE</a>).  Links and content are then fed into Facebook, organized by topic based on the keywords.  Some rudimentary analysis is performed (sentiment analysis at least, but as friendly as Microsoft is with the feds, and as LLMs have gotten popular, the influence of machines has probably expanded) and perused by agents, using some FBI internal interface.
</p>
<p>The TL;DR above probably implies this, but this is the longest post on here to date, by a wide margin.  I expect that most people will skip around instead of reading straight through:  probably only people running instances are going to be interested in the <a href="#Crash_course">technical parts</a>, and when building out <a href="#Who_is__a_href__https___boardreader_com___boardreader_com__a">the chronology</a> I erred on the side of providing too much information rather than simplifying.
</p>
<p><em>A note about links that go to fedi sites</em>:  some of them (like the main FSE site) are down, but if you put the links into your own instance's search box, you can generally find the post (if it federated; obviously if your instance is newer or if it's configured to scrub old posts, you might not have it) and view it on your own instance.  In either case, it's generally better to try searching for the post's URL on your home instance, whether that instance is currently live or not, because then you can interact with it locally.  (FSE is actually just a few commits from resuming federation, though being ready to use is a bit farther out.  Within the next few days, probably, it'll be possible to resume fetching objects from it; I have a couple of bugs to fix in the way Revolver stores users, though it's serving objects just fine.)
</p>
<h2 id="Root_Cause">Root Cause</h2>
<p>Pedophiles were showing up on FSE.  The rest of this section is background, the TL;DR is I had a problem getting pedophiles to stay away from FSE and I wanted to stop waking up in a cold sweat.  You can <a href="#Doing_some_digging">skip this bit</a> without missing much besides my woes and what I did about them.
</p>
<p>As far as I could reason, pedophiles were, besides being a problem themselves, the most likely reason for FSE to attract attention from law enforcement.  Nobody wants to host CP (or be in its vicinity) or get their gear seized because they fell asleep on the wheel and they let the pedos have free or they got CP-raided.  (If you are not familiar, this is a type of false-flag where a group of people floods a place with CP and then immediately alerts the FBI, usually done to get the site taken down.  Of course, you have to have it to upload it and usually if it results in any arrests, it results in the arrest of the attackers.)
</p>
<p>I was not happy about their arrival because, like with most fedi instances, it represented the primary existential threat to FSE, but as long as they weren't bothering any kids or uploading anything illegal, FSE has zero viewpoint censorship.  Almost invariably, they would immediately do something illegal.
</p>
<p>My initial suspicion was that they misunderstood the rules, the <a href="https://blog.freespeechextremist.com/blog/what-is-freedom-of-speech.html">meaning of freedom of speech</a>, something like that.  It turns out that a lot of them have a habit of just dumping illegal stuff <em>everywhere</em> and coming back in a week to see which accounts have been banned and which places have admins that are asleep (an approach that basically leaves no doubt that they are knowingly parasitic), then telling their friends", so you have to stay on top of it and get rid of them early, or they bring more.  It should not be a surprise that if someone's gratification is predicated on getting what they want without regard for who it hurts, that person is happy to engage in parasitic behavior like this:  violating a server and panicking an adult is no big deal if you're willing to violate a child and potentially ruin the kid's life.
</p>
<p>I'd like to also thank <a href="https://fba.ryona.agency/?domain=freespeechextremist.com">fediblock</a> for never fact-checking anything ever, <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/1d4b93bc31ef7f0923fa8ba902c64e48b1ca45f5725814b52f42c61b288cc004">giving the false impression</a> that <a href="https://blog.freespeechextremist.com/blog/the-loli-question.html">things that FSE has never permitted</a> were allowed.  FSE being fedi's equivalent of a dive bar, I understand people on "gated community" instances not wanting to deal with it (though <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/917fcd965d2a27d5b62f02494dc2e32cf11cfe6c8c965dda0b4c6d3beed234ec">it turns out</a> that instance-blocking is ham-fisted and just blocking a handful of accounts solves the problem), but I would prefer if they did not lie about their reasons or about me personally.  That sort of thing doesn't help when pedos show up having heard that there are no rules.  The blocks don't help them, either:  I've sent messages to admins on instances that were (hopefully unknowingly) hosting CP but got no response because they blocked FSE.  That's <em>their</em> problem, though; hope the block was worth it.
</p>
<p>It does mean that when <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/07/fbi-seizure-mastodon-server-wakeup-call-fediverse-users-and-hosts-protect-their">the FBI seized the kolektiva.social database backups</a>, nothing from FSE was in there.  As combative and block-happy as that instance was, very few other instances actually did make it into their database; for all anyone knows, the "accidental seizure" might have been just cover for a CI:  if the FBI wanted the database and the CI had it, serving an overly broad warrant lets them collect it without burning that informant.  I don't know anything about the people involved, but the FBI has used that tactic before.
</p>
<p>So when someone came looking for or attempting to provide CP I started just posting their IP and email and UA and whatever I had or could dig up.  (If you've punched a waiter, you can't complain that he refuses to bring you food.  Likewise with anyone trying to get me to host CP and then whining about me leaving them at the mercy of the internet.  I'm happy to care about your expectations for reasonable terms of service until you intentionally try something that you know is not just against the rules anywhere, but that can get the site eliminated and get me arrested.  I will do my best to discourage you from proceeding.)  I wanted to convey, completely unambiguously, that this is a hostile place to people doing that kind of thing:  the thing that <em>really</em> worries pedos is transparency.
</p>
<p>But it turns out that almost none of them were even paying attention:  they were just here to dump files or grab files and leave, or they expected to be banned 90% of the time and were looking for places where they didn't get banned.  So it didn't work, and I kept digging to figure out where they were coming from.
</p>
<h2 id="Doing_some_digging">Doing some digging</h2>
<p>If you are running an instance, it's even odds that you're doing it because you're interested in computers in general and the best way to learn is solving the problems that crop up.  This is great!  I have some helpful information; I post about it a lot but I haven't put it in one place.  Here is one place.  It's hopefully helpful to people that don't have a lot of experience with the topic and possibly has some bits that are of interest even to people that have been at this a long time.
</p>
<p>I've got a bigger piece about this in the larder but here's a survival guide:  it should give you enough that you can fill in the gaps by hitting the books, and enough of the technical background to understand the rest of the story.  It's a little dense in parts.
</p>
<h2 id="Why">Why?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, a lot of the documentation for any given piece of software ignores the problems that crop up:  coders like to think their software is painless and they treat information to the contrary as a bug in their code (or sometimes as a bug in the real world).  Pleroma and <a href="https://fedilist.com/source-code">similar software</a> also have two audiences:  users and people with their hands in the guts, and people with their hands in the guts need the real info.  But workarounds, real troubleshooting information, things like this are a little embarrassing to include.  "This is how much it'll tolerate before it breaks" is critical information, but the first thought a coder usually has is "It shouldn't break" and try to come up with a solution rather than document the tolerances.  (Eventually, <a href="https://aphyr.com/tags/Jepsen">everything breaks</a>.  You just don't know how much it takes or what happens when it breaks if you don't test it.)  Combine that with the the fact that most complaints come from people that expect the software to Just Work™ and you can expect that you won't get too many tips for learning how to deal with Weird, and if you run networked software that talks to the open internet, you will encounter Weird.  There are bots and scanners and worms, and as fedi grows, all servers become more interesting targets.  And if it's a high-traffic server with open registrations, you'll attract at least a little targeted attention.  (And of course, more if you call the server something like "freespeechextremist.com":  I may as well make the favicon a big, red bullseye.  But I like encountering Weird, so it's no trouble for me.)
</p>
<p>But the Weird is only weird until you have an answer, so between that and the paucity of documentation of the Weird (because it is nebulous, because coders often don't know all the bugs and if they do, they often don't like to document them, and because high-traffic servers are rare on fedi), your best bet is to get good at diagnostic tooling and analyzing data.  Half of running a server of any sort is being able to tell if something undesirable is going on and the other half is figuring out the shape of it.  (Actually fixing it tends to be trivial.)  That is, you come up with questions and then you figure out how to answer them.  A lot of the questions are going to be "Why is this slow?" or "Why did this stop working?" but if you understand the stream of logs, sometimes the questions are going to be "What the hell is <em>that</em>?"
</p>
<p>You want to be able to understand the logs directly, but you will also need to be able to understand them in aggregate and correlate them with other logs.  Luckily for you, it's all text streams and text files and Unix is <em>full</em> of tools for answering questions about text.  Here's the <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/2d50aa0f78a11a3b5d3cac3c5580a16085811bd3fd2db5fc6cd4322accdcc8e7">crash course</a>!
</p>
<h2 id="Crash_course">Crash course!</h2>
<p>This is dense but not difficult:  if you can set up Postgres and Pleroma and nginx, this material is all within your grasp.  Learn one of the things below and you will get some use out of it, and the use is exponential the more of them that you learn.
</p>
<p>If you know any scripting languages, you can learn enough awk for it to be useful in 30 minutes:  every awk program is <code>predicate1{action1} predicate2{action2} [...]</code>.  If you don't, you can probably pick up awk in a few hours.  (I'm serious, no exaggerating.  Do yourself a favor.)  If you combine this with <code>tail -f</code> and <code>mawk -Winteractive</code> then this is as much as you need in order to do real-time analysis of your log files.  I can't speak highly enough of awk's usefulness:  it's like the SQL of plain text.
</p>
<p>If you are any good with awk and some basic networking tools (dig, whois, traceroute, tcpdump, iftop), you know how to use datasets (<a href="https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/nro-delegated-stats">NRO delegated stats</a>, for example; whois on IPs will often give a geofeed URL, etc.) and services (whois again, <a href="https://blog.shodan.io/5-free-things-for-everybody/">Shodan</a> is a good start, DDG <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bangs">lists several services</a> that it integrates), it's possible to figure out just from your webserver logs who is who, when someone signed up (grep the logs for the <code>POST</code> to the accounts endpoint), from where, whether or not it was a <a href="https://check.torproject.org/exit-addresses">Tor exit</a> or proxy, what language they have told their browser to say they speak, things like that.  There is no shortage of tools for network exploration, and the more you learn about how the Internet works, the better you'll be able to use them.  That should suffice:  do a few hours of reading and you have just put your competence into the top 10% of fedi admins, and learned some things that you can apply anywhere.
</p>
<p>nginx, lighttpd, Apache httpd, and almost all of the other webservers that are popular to set in front of fedi for load-balancing or caching or filtering or rate-limiting, they all have a some directives that allow you to control the format of the logfiles, log arbitrary headers, timing information.  It's not always necessary, but keep it in your pocket for when you need it.  With FSE (and other servers I run, not just fedi stuff), I usually strip most of the quote marks added in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format">common log format</a>, I add a lot of timing information (especially time required to get a response from the backend).  I also use tabs, effectively making the log files a big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values">TSV</a>:  the extra space makes the files a little easier to read visually, a little simpler to use with awk, but also opens up the tooling options:  R, sed, sort, nearly anything can read TSVs.  Read the output of grep into irb or some other REPL that's good at string-mangling; set <code>IFS</code> and pipe it into a <code>while read line</code> loop in bash.  Or if you have some favorite spreadsheet software, they can all read TSVs (but you'll probably want to filter it or split it into chunks unless you have the kind of spreadsheet software that doesn't choke on a 20GB file).  (Of course, because I deal with 20GB files, the tooling I use <a href="https://livefreeordichotomize.com/posts/2019-06-04-using-awk-and-r-to-parse-25tb/index.html">can handle pretty big files</a>.)  In fact, although awk is like SQL for delimited text, you can even use regular SQL:  <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/sqlite/one-line-csv-operations">sqlite3 can operate on text pipelines</a>.  And if you're good with SQL, check the man page for psql:  you can have it emit TSVs pretty easily!  A full SQL tutorial would take longer than awk, but SQL is very useful to pick up.
</p>
<p>Really simple numerical analysis is indispensable when you are looking for aberrances:  the Weird sticks out.  If you're tailing the logs and piping that somewhere, you can keep a running average and calculate standard deviations and find the outliers.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule">68, 95, 99.7</a>:  calculate the standard deviation of your window, and you can find things that stick out.  (In awk, this is really concise, since it keeps track of line—technically "record"—numbers automatically:  <code>{a[NR%1000]=$0}</code> keeps the last thousand records in the array <code>a</code>.)  Some endpoints start to get a disproportionate amount of traffic out of nowhere, some IPs show up out of nowhere and flood you.  Finding things that stick out is the point of data analysis.  (This is the sort of tool I was writing/using when I would post things like "90% of the POSTs are coming from the same address".)  On fedi, network-based DDoS tends to be more popular than targeting specific endpoints; if you see <a href="https://techhub.social/users/Drand">someone suddenly hammering TWKN</a>, and it's probably <a href="https://nya.social/notes/818c3d1bdb3e20788eb08e25">a scraper</a>.  (Probably!)
</p>
<p>The last thing to learn is when you're being too paranoid:  sometimes it's not a DDoS, someone just linked to a post from a popular site like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN</a>, sometimes <a href="https://nya.social/notes/818c3d1bdb3e20788eb08e25">an idiot wrote the scraper and doesn't understand rate-limiting</a>.  (Always include a mechanism to limit the rate, even if you are making <a href="https://git.freespeechextremist.com/gitweb/?p=embot;a=blob;f=embot;h=21a11493cec9b361ee54884dd3de10fce8750cb2;hb=HEAD#l220">a trivial Markov bot</a>.)  Sometimes, it's just someone trying to write a new client and the client has a bug:  fedi is exciting like that, there are hackers all over.
</p>
<h2 id="Scar_Tissue">Scar Tissue</h2>
<p>Over time, running a service, you bump into problems, and your service grows solutions to those problems, and you keep the solutions around so that you don't have the same problem twice.  The service acquires scar tissue, reminders of problems, marks that distinguish it from a new service.  (The scar tissue is one of the reasons that you encounter so many surprises when doing a big rewrite.)
</p>
<p>Early in FSE's history, we had some malicious signups:  just normal spammers.  I view captchas as hostile to legitimate users and ineffective (and of course, <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/captchaboy/pleroma_captcha_solver">Pleroma's captchas have been cracked</a> since then).  Likewise with email verification, except that expecting a real email isn't just hostile design, it's also a privacy risk.  There's a tradeoff there:  I have to manually generate password resets if people forget them, FSE can't send out email notifications, things like that, but on the other hand, someone that wants email addresses isn't going to target FSE, and in the event FSE <em>is</em> compromised, the email addresses aren't leaked.  (If someone has an email address and a password, the first thing they'll do is try to use that combination on other services.  If they don't have a real email address, though, they can't.)  But there are a lot of tradeoffs you have to make and people that don't like the ones I made can make different servers or join different ones.
</p>
<p>There's work stuff where, if you can use an off-the-shelf solution to a problem, that's usually what you want; it's generally an explicit policy to spend as little time as possible on things that aren't part of your core business.  That's reasonable but I don't think web applications have gotten <em>more</em> reliable in the decade and a half since this became conventional wisdom, so maybe it's worth considering the emergent properties of this kind of policy.  So when I'm on my own, a project where I have no boss and no reason to compromise, I generally roll my own solutions.  I like coding anyway so it's not a costly experiment, and these solutions generally end up faster, more reliable, and more flexible; aside from that, I'm not at a vendor's mercy for bugfixes.  (There are always bugs.  The difference is whether I've got to try to find them in someone else's 200kLOC codebase or in my own 4-line script.  Additionally, you can guess whether it's faster to bash a four-line script into the text editor or tweak a 400-line config file.)
</p>
<p>So I needed a way to tamp down on the spam without making the site suck:  my solution was to tail the logs, send them through an awk script, and it would just email me when it saw someone do <code>POST /api/v1/accounts</code> and get a 200 back.  Eventually I expanded the script and it would do things like check <code>pidof xlock</code> as a reasonable approximation of whether I was at my desk and if xlock wasn't running, it would pipe <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/4741d89afcf57973a9afcc973a43804a6ce4e6134b96d38dcd87173ed5b1e9e9">a message</a> through <code>espeak -s120 -v other/en-sc</code>.  (I call him "scotbot".  As you can hear, I did have it correctly pluralize "user" but forgot to change "there are" to "there is" when only one occurred.)  At some point, we got a really big hit, and I had nginx rate-limit signups to one per minute.  Later on, I did the welcomebot, so new signups would be announced in public.
</p>
<p>So I would keep an eye on new users arriving:  usually it was just merry shiptoasters, but once in a while I see a pedo show and this sets off the self-preservation instincts, so I dump the stuff they've done and if they are still there and I haven't had to hit the red button yet (that is, they haven't done <code>POST /api/v1/media</code> yet, compelling me to kill off their IP and account and delete all of the shit they uploaded), I can watch them move around, look at what they are searching for.
</p>
<p>The pedos would land on a page, some post or something, usually a local mirror of a post from another instance, then they'd sign up, start mashing search terms into the box (which is usually how I noticed them:  some search terms were added to an awk script that would ping me), follow a handful of accounts, and usually just leave.  A peculiar thing stuck out:  a lot of them were coming from <a href="https://boardreader.com/">boardreader.com</a>, based on the <code>Referer</code> header, so I tugged on that thread, and that thread turned out to be the weird one.
</p>
<h2 id="Who_is__a_href__https___boardreader_com___boardreader_com__a">Who is <a href="https://boardreader.com/">boardreader.com</a>?</h2>
<p>I'd never heard of them, so I looked around, and <a href="https://boardreader.com/">boardreader.com</a> was a strange site indeed:  very barebones, didn't work over Tor, no contact information listed anywhere.  (Some time in the interim, they added a SocialGist banner at the bottom...that goes to a 404 now that SocialGist has moved.)  I bashed in some of the search queries that the pedos had used on FSE and was pretty horrified to find the posts they landed on, all of which originated on other servers, but all of which were also ascribed to FSE.
</p>
<p>It turns out that BoardReader was a tool for searching forums.  The authors don't appear to understand what fedi is, so they had treated FSE as a forum, and all of the public posts that came to FSE from elsewhere as forum posts made on some forum called "freespeechextremist.com".
</p>
<p>Apparently it was a small search index for forums and it got big enough to be bought by a Japanese company, the two founders had issues with the new owners, and the company eventually was sloughed off and acquired by <a href="https://socialgist.com/">SocialGist</a> (which now redirects you to <a href="https://www.socialgist.ai/">socialgist.ai</a>).  SocialGist purports to sell "accessible social data", they list <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230201153015/https://socialgist.com/data-sources/">several data sources</a>, and per <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250124110504/https://socialgist.com/blog/">their blog</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240415001121/https://blog.socialgist.com/understanding-how-we-find-data">their developers are in Serbia</a>, which lines up with the IP they were using, so I've started thinking I've got the right people.
</p>
<p>Most of the search results indicated that long ago, BoardReader identified itself in the User-Agent header and most of the targets viewed it as hostile:  it's present on a lot of lists of poorly behaved bots.  There are also complaints about it on a lot of forums, and there are threads where people are asking how to stop it; in those threads, some people show up from nowhere and suggest that the person running the board should be grateful for the traffic bump.  (If you owned a search engine for discussion boards, wouldn't you use it to search for mentions of your engine?  And if you were running a somewhat aggressive crawler that was annoying people, it's a matter of temperament to decide whether to ask what would bother people less versus showing up to argue with them.  I give it even odds that those posts were made by owners or employees at BoardReader itself.)
</p>
<h2 id="BoardReader_and_FSE">BoardReader and FSE</h2>
<h2 id="2023_03_05__Sunday">2023-03-05 (Sunday)</h2>
<p>I went over and grepped the logs to see if they'd been to FSE:  nothing.  But they had to be getting data from FSE:  they had posts from other instances and links to FSE.  So I kept looking and found a large amount of scraping on <code>/api/v1/timelines/public?local=false</code> from a browser claiming to be Chrome, and coming through way faster than a human could scroll even if they were leaning on the Page Down key.
</p>
<p>spider1.boardreader.com through spider43 all had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types#A">A records</a>, but traffic was coming through 45.15.176.187 (which was, at the time, <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/b110271c6ec2ed688cbbce406a6a1ca9379145ec3d54ba2c7a73927970df47dc">owned by DediPath</a>).  That was odd, right:  why would BoardReader go to the trouble of making A records for their spiders and then go through some other service?
</p>
<p>So, I tell the server to drop traffic from the IPs that were scraping.  Problem solved!  Then immediately I start seeing a large number of attempts from different IPs.  Residential IPs in the US:  they're buying residential proxies.  It's one thing to lie in the User-Agent header, but it's a step past that to pay money to evade detection.  Someone that has money to burn wants FSE scraped, probably a business.  At this point I'm certain enough that it's BoardReader.  I dash off a quick email to <a href="mailto:info@boardreader.com">info@boardreader.com</a> asking for information on their crawler.  Since they are going to lengths to hide what they are doing, I don't expect much, but it doesn't hurt.
</p>
<h2 id="2023_03_08__Wednesday">2023-03-08 (Wednesday)</h2>
<p>So I need an automated approach if they're automatically hopping proxies.  <code>awk</code> and <code>iptables</code> plus a really quick Ruby script to sit between nginx and Pleroma for that endpoint, and I can start dropping traffic from any IP that tries to hit FSE with that token.  If I keep it there, I'll exhaust their proxies before they fill their cache.
</p>
<p>Eventually, the requests dry up and I see a request from an IP owned by a Serbian ISP that leads back to <a href="https://devtools.boardreader.com/">devtools.boardreader.com</a>.  It acts like a normal browser:  it loads all the resources, grabs a Bearer token, executes JavaScript, and subsequent to that, the scraping resumes using that token.  They're trying to play back a browser session:  that's clever.  Watching the logs confirms it:  bots using that token start arriving, playing back the sequence of requests, and then hammering the hell out of the public timeline again.  To verify, I wander back through their site and see that they are indeed getting new posts from that batch of requests.
</p>
<p>I start severely limiting TWKN by cranking the rate-limiting way up.  At this point, it starts throwing 429s even at legitimate users, so I finally <a href="https://freespeechextremist.com/objects/8061b855-1dd7-4fbb-95de-cd812dd04a49">talked about the problem in public some</a> after mostly keeping it to myself or in DMs.  (And, of course, writing this has made me regret not having taken notes with timestamps.  I've had to piece everything together from scattered notes, timestamps on scripts and logs, DMs, etc.  The first draft of this post was missing some information and had the chronology wrong.)
</p>
<p>BoardReader is sneaky and annoying and using fraudulent means to extract data from FSE over my objections, but now thay I can isolate their traffic, I can I try a lot of different approaches.  They aren't going to get any legitimate data again, but I can see how their crawler behaves.  I start just sending back 429s:  their scraper responds by sending <em>more</em> requests.  Apparently, if it doesn't get the response it wants, it just repeats the request immediately, no delay.  Rude, but they have some confidence in their ability to get around restrictions, so they don't have to be polite.  But this is worse:  they send the reqs back so fast that it actually saturates the pipe, it's basically a worse DoS than before.  Unsurprisingly, sending back 401s, 403s, 500s, same result.  So I start just sending <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-10.4.3">402 Payment Required</a>, an idea I got from <a href="https://poa.st/users/graf">graf</a>.  Unfortunately, this means no one gets anything from TWKN for a while.
</p>
<h2 id="2023_03_13__Monday">2023-03-13 (Monday)</h2>
<p>...And that's when they finally get back to me.  I had sent an email to <a href="mailto:info@boardreader.com">info@boardreader.com</a> on the 5th telling them that I was looking for information on their crawler, and on the 13th, after the server has started adamantly refusing to I finally get an email from <a href="mailto:dave@socialgist.com">dave@socialgist.com</a> asking what I want to know.  Noncommittal.  I reply to him a few hours later, at 20:45 UTC, explaining the problem and telling him if he wants to index that he'll need to only fetch local posts and use a UA that identifies BoardReader.  He tells me at 21:01 that he'll forward it to the engineering team and asks what domains I'd like them to quit crawling.  I give the entire IP range that I owned and complain about the pedophiles.  While we're corresponding, their developers are still scraping and actively debugging the scraper, so I mention that he could save them some time.  I can another Serbian IP address.  Over email, I offer to talk to their devs, I pass a few links to <a href="https://fedilist.com/">FediList</a> (which was still on the <code>demo.</code> subdomain at the time), I try to explain how fedi works.

<p>So obviously I don't trust them.  Dave stops replying to emails, and they're not only ''still' scraping, but they are trying to get around the countermeasures:  SocialGist is lying.  They're actively putting work into continuing to do something they've promised to stop doing:  they can't get anything out of TWKN (the last real post they got from FSE was on the 8th), and they're doing their damnedest to try to rectify this, while telling me that they'll stop.  If they felt really good about it, they'd have no reason to lie, so either their motivations are not what what they say, or the person I'm dealing with is not the same person that has decided to put FSE on the list and then told the devs to make sure they can get posts from it.

<h2 id="Then_the_FBI_shows_up">...Then the FBI shows up</h2>
<h2 id="2023_03_14__Tuesday">2023-03-14 (Tuesday)</h2>
<p>The morning after Dave ghosted me, I got <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/1e24f117e3892a83e9f998f5fb636a3b99711e27e3ff37743f20746708b1b6e4">an email</a> from an fbi.gov email address, the subject line "Emergency Disclosure Request", and this in the body:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is Special Agent Peter Christenson, with the FBI. I am requesting subscriber information for the user "WitchKingOfAngmar." This user posted the attached threat. Please let me know if you can assist with this request.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It also includes <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/8601d634946331754840b13513cddfabcf559f4e2f62122d72c4015c5e57390e">FSE Screen Shot.PNG</a>.  I've never seen someone outside fedi refer to freespeechextremist.com as FSE, so my first thought is it was a prank, but the headers and my mail server's logs and the SPF info for fbi.gov all indicated that this was a real email from the place it claimed to be from.
</p>
<p>This was the attached screenshot, which, despite being labeled "FSE Screen Shot", is not a screenshot of FSE:
</p>
<img src="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/8601d634946331754840b13513cddfabcf559f4e2f62122d72c4015c5e57390e" alt="Not a screenshot of FSE">
<p>So after I was reasonably certain that it was a legitimate email, my first reaction was to rack my brain trying to remember who the hell "WitchKingOfAngmar" was.  He didn't sound familiar to me.  I checked and this was a user at <a href="https://sneed.social/">sneed.social</a> (which was dead for a long time, but appears to have <a href="https://fedilist.com/instance/sneed.social">come back recently</a>).  The screenshot had some interesting bits in it.  For one thing, despite being named "FSE Screen Shot", FSE has never looked like that.  It also described FSE as a "forum".  In fact, the top said "Forum • Blackrock Executiv...".  Some text is highlighted, "kill blackrock" "larry fink", as if those were search terms.  There was also some rudimentary sentiment analysis.  The post itself was from 26 days before the email was sent, but the screenshot read "11 hours ago" and "13 hours".  (So much for "Emergency" from the subject line, but it also indicates that it takes two hours for a post to go through whatever that system is.)
</p>
<p>Obviously, you don't expect to receive an email from the FBI, so it took me a minute to figure out what to make of it.  WitchKingOfAngmar's post was clearly a threat but it was also clearly absurd, an obvious joke, not a credible threat.  And obviously, he wrote it to troll the admins of the site.
</p>
<p>I know a couple of pretty good lawyers in case anything crazy happens, but the goal is always to make sure that nothing crazy happens.  So, best-case scenario, everything from FSE is public:  if you can't see it, I don't have it.  Ideally, the FBI gets that and I don't have to do any convincing.  Worst-case scenario is they kick in the door and grab the server.  They'd need a warrant to do that, and they wouldn't ask politely if they had a warrant already...unless they were trying to get me to say no or they were trying to see how I respond.
</p>
<p>Dealing with law enforcement is usually an uphill battle to convince a person afflicted with motivated reason of the obvious.  They are looking for something, their job performance is predicated on finding it, and when that's the case, it's hard to get them to look at something that isn't the thing they're looking for, even if that thing demonstrates very clearly that what they are looking for is not here.
</p>
<p>On top of that, I'm paranoid.  I go ask the dead spacemen for their thoughts and one of them points out that posting about it might count as obstruction and the FBI had lately been somewhat zealous about obstruction charges.  (Good to have solid friends with level heads.)
</p>
<p>And the previous day, fresh on my mind because the memes were flying, <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/9c7e72e28d6b8f9add669ef70f40ded4bba81bde46e6726537f63f2caea47fac">Mike Chitwood</a> (mostly notable for <a href="https://www.mambaonline.com/2017/06/06/newspaper-outs-18-men-arrested-cruising-florida-parks/">publicizing mugshots of people arrested for, though not convicted of, cruising</a>, part of his <a href="https://edramatica.com/The_Daytona_Nine">long-running battle to stop gay dudes in Daytona Beach since at least 2006</a>) had just <a href="https://www.volusiasheriff.gov/news/volusia-county-sheriff/video-new-jersey-man-identified-arrested-following-online-threat-to-murder-sheriff-chitwood.stml">had Richard Golden extradited</a> for saying "Just shoot him in the head" on, uh, apparently it was "<a href="https://www.news-journalonline.com/story/news/crime/2023/03/15/richard-golden-what-we-know-about-the-new-jersey-man-accused-of-threatening-sheriff-mike-chitwood/70012169007/">a 4CHAN chatroom, a communications platform shared by extremist groups</a>".  (Informed citizens may recognize 4chan as <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/e427aa87b4a334f0ed4f59f6ab2485cf4e9bbd381fa8bc5353a495a80040e0f2">a far-left website</a> as well.)  It is kind of interesting that Chitwood used the same "eradicating scumbags" language about neo-Nazi propagandists and gay dudes bangin' in the woods.  But anyway, I couldn't help noticing that there had just been a case where cops were getting excited about anonymous internet threats.
</p>
<p>The timing was a little obvious:  they got it from BoardReader.  I go and find the post on BoardReader, to make sure it's in their index.  It is:
</p>
<img src="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/1337eade3854b2802404520b99448300a920d821cff0c5d1ba9f8599f7944c02" title="Fans of long-ass hashes may notice that this one starts with 1337!" alt="Exactly the same shit the FBI sent me, just a different UI.">
<p>The odds that the FBI and BoardReader would screw up the Unicode in exactly the same way are pretty low.  (The original Unicode codepoints, 1f9e2, 1f438, and 1f44d, got turned into question mark boxes indicating invalid Unicode.  BoardReader's codebase being a mess of PHP, no surprise.)  A common glitch is not absolute, but there is the other unlikely mistake, that a post from somewhere else is ascribed to FSE.  Guess now I know why Dave ghosted:  they're scraping for the FBI, he can't turn it off.  Legally, the FBI can't pay a private organization to do something that they can't do, but if the organization is doing something on their own and the FBI "doesn't" (<em>cough</em>) know and doesn't ask, they're just buying access to a stream of data, not paying someone to violate the CFAA.
</p>
<p>🧢🐸👍</p>
<p>I had been saying for a while that the three-letter agencies don't really "get" fedi.  Decentralized networks take some explaining to regular people, but individuals can get them.  But there's a long way from an individual understanding it to an organization understanding it.  (If you haven't ever worked in a stultifying bureaucracy, think about the amount of time that passes between a rumor propagating through your extended family and any sort of concrete change in behavior propagating.  Something can be obvious to everyone and still not obvious to the organization as a whole.)  Apparently the <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/faa13e7f66b7ff9e97634aaf04f6fd4faab95cf3931080fd03b0d98d76c7df2a?name=hydra-on-the-web.pdf">German feds</a> get it and the feds in the US are <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/835374c1bfa10895663d4d1c94500049823ea928fb7e9c47b01a6b7f8f07c091?name=nsf-staff-report.pdf">starting to get it</a>.  But this more or less confirmed it:  SocialGist doesn't understand what fedi is, really, and the FBI saw "It came from this website" and they just rolled with it.
</p>
<p>So I get my head together and reply, explaining that since the guy was on another server, I don't have the information he is looking for, that BoardReader wrote "Free Speech Extremist" on the post but that it didn't come from FSE.  And, miraculously, that works:  he asks who to ask, I tell him to check the origin server, and ask him if he'd rather I not discuss the exchange in public, with no response.
</p>
<h2 id="2023_03_15__Wednesday">2023-03-15 (Wednesday)</h2>
<p>BoardReader is still hammering FSE and getting only 402s in response.
</p>
<p>Still corresponding with Special Agent Christenson, but no reply until East Coast business hours start.  (My last email was 15:50 on the 14th in LA, 18:50 in Quantico.)  The last email is him saying thanks, I ask him one more time if it would bother the FBI if I said something, and nothing.  In the mean time, I've been alternating between disappearing from fedi and running around TWKN being twitchy and paranoid while the actual endpoint is spewing errors.  It's better to be transparent and I usually am but people are asking questions.  The FBI guy probably can't say "Sure, write whatever, here's a selfie!" but if they wanted me not to say anything, he could definitely tell me not to say anything, so I figure it's fine.  On the other hand, the whole thing still made no sense.  (Maybe it made no sense to him either and he was just doing what his boss said.)  So I give a limited explanation and a promise to deliver a full explanation, then wait for the flashbang to come through my window, because, although I was certain I wasn't doing anything wrong or illegal, I am really paranoid:

</p>
<p>I realize that was a screenshot of a very long post in the middle of a very long article; you'll notice that it ends with an announcement that FSE is going into lockdown until further notice:  no viewing TWKN or public timelines without an account, and registrations closed.  I recommended everyone else do the same.  I hate doing that and I hate when other instances do it, but a lot of instances follow suit.

<p>I'm on the edge of my seat, watching BoardReader continue to fail to get around the wall of 402s.  (As verifying the bearer token means a round-trip to the DB, I'm still mostly kicking them out by using nginx, along with a pile of awk scripts that .)  They're using residential proxies, they're using Tor, they're rotating the User-Agent strings every request  No word from them <em>or</em> the FBI for a week.
</p>
<p>I don't say much beyond the public post, but I ping the admin of sneed.social and ask him if the FBI agent contacted him, I send him the link to my post.  (I didn't know him, but everyone said he was reasonable to deal with when it was something like this, and he was.)  He goes to check his email, says that he'll reach out, and remarks that the user in question was actively trying to get banned, due to some other issue; I didn't ask.

<p><a href="https://detroitriotcity.com/">Detroit Riot City</a> trolls the neo-Nazi admin of <a href="https://fedilist.com/instance/pieville.net">Pieville</a>, Alex Linder.  (Neo-Nazis are notorious for having no sense of humor; they take themselves too seriously.  They also tend to have difficulty with subtlety.)  <em>Purely by coincidence</em>, right after Linder blocks them, someone registers a new account on DRC to <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/e46f62ce82ff1663ec67924950e0cd4a38f6a25eea10e59db0a0e517507ba762">post a threat to blow up some Jewish hospitals</a>, and then someone reports this post to the FBI in under a minute, less time than it would have taken to read it.
</p>
<p>This dissipates pretty quickly:  the fed checks it out because he's got to, but it's pretty obvious, isn't it?  Your guess is as good as mine with regards to why no one was arrested for sending the FBI a false report.

<p>At this point, I figure enough time has elapsed that if the FBI wanted me to keep their secrets, they would have asked by now, so I just dump everything I had at that point.  The above covers it more thoroughly, and there's no screenshot this time; the raw post has the object ID <a href="https://freespeechextremist.com/objects/5c7246c1-024b-4e74-b4e2-7e88ef019024">https://freespeechextremist.com/objects/5c7246c1-024b-4e74-b4e2-7e88ef019024</a> if you want to dump that into your instance's search bar.

<p>There are a couple of bits worth including here, so I'll quote them.  I've <a href="https://blog.freespeechextremist.com/blog/on-human-bots.html">mentioned this before on the blog</a>, but the tone on fedi is significantly less formal (one is less likely to tell the same joke at work on Monday morning that they told at the bar on Friday night), so please bear with me while I quote myself.  If you're unfamiliar with the slang, a "fedpost" is a post that includes threats of violence, and a "glowie" is a federal agent.  These terms are usually used humorously.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can't find any other fedi instances on there, but this is a pretty annoying scraper to get rid of.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This hasn't changed; as far as I know, FSE is the only one they were scraping.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The glowies are (or want to convey that they are) specifically looking at threats against Blackrock executives.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out that "want to convey that they are" was correct, but I didn't know that until much later.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember everyone that was freaking out about the various search engines on fedi, most recently as:Public? Remember that I keep saying that there are scrapers getting at fedi *without* identifying themselves? It turns out that I was right and this is because I AM A GODDAMN GENIUS and EVERYONE THAT HAS EVER TOLD ME THAT I AM WRONG IS A RETARDED COPROPHILIAC. There are scrapers getting data out of fedi without identifying themselves and at least one of them is selling data to the FBI.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has still not sunk in for most of the people that are worried about, e.g., Archive Team, as:Public, FediList, etc.  (Especially the text in all-caps.)  I have linked to some other cases above.

<p>I continue to recommend this.

<p>I think I'm going to reopen the public timeline and registrations, but that's tentative. Since boardreader.com is still attempting to scrape TWKN, if I reopen TWKN to people that aren't logged in, it will be with the terrible hacks I was using before to get boardreader.com to stop scraping.

<p>I've been keeping track of traffic referred to FSE by BoardReader.  Unsurprisingly, this post, written by a Markov bot that lives on a completely different server (and as always, attributed to FSE by BoardReader), is the most frequent URL that people land on if they come from BoardReader:
</p>
<img src="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/af87db5891bb570942ee3a1eb82eb9fdd608aab3c8be8e1a12da9b2bf181aa0d" alt="a bot rambling about CSAM for some reason">
<p>Anyone that is putting search terms into BoardReader and getting <em>that</em> post is someone that I would like to discourage from signing up.
</p>
<h2 id="2023_03_24__Friday__and_subsequent_weeks">2023-03-24 (Friday) and subsequent weeks</h2>
<p>Clearly, sending them emails and making sure that they can't scrape were not working, and they're still trying to fix their scraper, they're still hammering the API endpoint for fetching the posts.  Pedophiles are still landing on FSE, coming from boardreader.com.  That was the issue from the beginning, and it's been weeks.  I want to open the timelines back up, re-open registrations.  We've been on lockdown too long!  Plus, the site is slow as hell because BoardReader is choking my server (even though they're getting no data, they're still sending multiple requests per second), and on top of that, I'm paying bandwidth overage charges.
</p>
<p>Since I've talked to them and got them to agree and I've stopped sending them data, and they're still trying to get around the restrictions and still sending pedophiles, I've exhausted reasonable methods.
</p>
<p>So I grab some samples of the timeline, and bash out a small <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100127161358/http://hoohoo.ncsa.illinois.edu/cgi/">CGI script</a>:  it just does string substitutions, mashing together accounts that do not exist and generating posts that do not exist.  (Initially the IDs were just random 32-bit numbers.  Eventually half the number varied per post and half was derived from the timestamp of the request, so I could trace the posts through BoardReader more easily.)  I don't bother making the URLs match actual Pleroma URLs:  why would I?  They just have to be unique.  I also have to start up <a href="https://www.lighttpd.net/">lighttpd</a> to serve it:  FSE uses nginx, but since nginx doesn't support CGI scripts (a travesty), I've got to send the requests for that endpoint to lighttpd.  Because I was still all the way in awk mode, of course I just used awk.  For fun, I grabbed some lists of words to include in the posts:  some based on search terms people had used on BoardReader, and then rounded out with the CARNIVORE list.  (First search result; I don't know if it was the real list or not but it didn't really matter.)
</p>
<p>It worked:  you can see <a href="https://archive.is/aDKNA">an archived sample of the gibberish</a> or a <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/1d4a30d103f90230ad734aa74e80ef292194a5ad4551946f4a3d4c529ea80831">screenshot of different gibberish</a>.  Of course, it worked beautifully:

<p>The only problem was that the scraper loved it <em>too</em> much.  We were suddenly getting DoS'd by their scraper.  So I built in a little delay and then had a fun idea:  jam the BoardReader search terms in.  And I saw something <em>really</em> weird very suddenly:
</p>
<img src="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/7fd1ea217eb279e31a4fae7a6a976fa5be00e5bf65d8b7dfbf322b6b92fd99be" alt="timestamps and a large number of blue 4s and hyphens, explained below">
<p>This is an awk script that draws a histogram of the requests coming into FSE.  The basic idea is really simple:  the first version of it just printed a "." and then when the timestamp changed, it printed a newline, too.  This draws a histogram for you of the number of requests per second, in real-time if you can convince awk not to buffer excessively (e.g., <code>mawk -Winteractive</code>).  By this time, it had gotten somewhat more sophisticated:  the hyphens represent requests that received a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-10.2">2xx status code</a>, the blue hyphens representing POST requests and the others GETs.  When the request resulted in some other status code, the first digit was printed.  The end of the line contains summary data:  number of requests that second in brackets, followed by the number of 5xx errors, followed by the ratio of server errors to total requests (as a fraction and a percentage) and the average number of requests per second.  Like many scripts that were unreasonably useful and then gew bit by bit (usually under duress, while trying to fix a problem with the server), it is nearly unreadable but is surprisingly compact and reliable.  (<a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/1965c57f5e3becafa64b68431d9d279ed6f7bcfcd94933c08a0f2496c8f1fb37">Here is the version that I was running when I took the screenshot</a> for the curious; you probably won't get any direct use out of it unless you're using the same logfile format as me, but if you can read it, it should be pretty straightforward:  it's messy, but not complex.)
</p>
<p>The big field of green-on-blue 4s sticks out:  those are requests that resulted in a 402, in this case almost all originating from Facebook, and all of them requesting URLs matching the fake posts.  Facebook shouldn't have been crawling FSE's public timeline.
</p>
<p>You might have noticed that the random IDs were present in the posts:  the script generating the random gibberish didn't keep any history, because I didn't want the problem of storing infinite random gibberish, but I could match posts on BoardReader to URLs in the webserver logs by just pasting these random IDs into the search form on BoardReader.  So I dropped IDs from the posts into the BoardReader search box, and that more or less confirmed it:  Facebook was fetching these posts shortly after BoardReader indexed them.  Apparently BoardReader was giving Facebook a feed of their data, but it wasn't just that:  there was a common thread in the gibberish, a pattern in the posts that Facebook was interested in.  You can probably guess the hypothesis, the test, and the result:  I opened up the CGI script and, where there had been a long, random list of words to cram into the posts, I replaced it with just one phrase:  "larry fink".
</p>
<p>Almost as soon as I saved the file, Facebook started flooding my server.  I wanted my keystrokes to start echoing again so I un-did it, replacing the list with the previous version except without "larry fink", and the flow slowed to a trickle and then stopped.  Curiosity got the best of me so I re-did it, and after the wait for Boardreader to index it, the flood resumed.
</p>
<p>So the pipeline was my terrible awk script generating JSON that represented gibberish posts, and that went out through lighttpd, then nginx, then it left my machine and went into BoardReader's crawlers, from there into their index (however that was built) and straight out to Facebook, and presumably from there to the FBI, and from there into whatever UI that was that they were using to search.  (Zuckerberg had just testified in Congress that Facebook was critical national infrastructure:  maybe he wasn't lying.)
</p>
<h2 id="Further_Shenanigans">Further Shenanigans</h2>
<p>How <em>do</em> you get BoardReader to stop?  I couldn't get them to respond to emails and filling their database with gibberish wasn't helping.
</p>
<p>So I shoved some more delays in:  eventually I spaced out the writes until they were a trickle designed to finish exactly one second before the timeout happened.  That solved the bandwidth overages:  they were just using a trickle.  For fun, I tossed in a little more randomness:  once in a while, I'd omit some random characters from the end so that it wouldn't parse.  Maybe if the error rate spiked, they'd notice.  You can get partial data out of something like that if you're using an event-based parser or you've structured it to use coroutines or thunks or whatever; the type of thing that builds up a data structure piecemeal and leaves you with a valid (if incomplete) data structure (and this approach can let you work with JSON structures that are too big to fit in memory, of course), but the overwhelming majority of JSON parsers just take a string and give you a data structure or an error:  it's easier to call something like that.  It looks like BoardReader is using the common type, so they spend about a minute on a single request and end up with no useful data.  The situation stays <a href="https://archive.is/U0CNN">exactly like that</a> for a while.
</p>
<p>It's annoying, but I don't have to worry about it too often.  I pop in and tweak the random timeline script's output or its behavior once in a while.  And then I have a pretty evil idea:  I just start putting Dave's phone number into the randomly generated posts.  The following morning I get a reply from Dave:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hey peter, sorry for the radio silence. i've filed a jira ticket this week and hopefully will have an answer for you shortly. if we need any more information i'll loop in one of our engineers.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guess it worked!  We go back and forth very briefly and they stop scraping pretty quickly, though it takes about a week for them to get FSE out of their index.  It shouldn't take a week for that to happen; whether they were stalling or it actually took that long, I probably won't find out.
</p>
<h2 id="Epilogue___Torswats">Epilogue:  Torswats</h2>
<p>The story wrapped up just short of a year after it started, in a very unexpected way.
</p>
<h2 id="2024_01_18">2024-01-18</h2>
<p>Alan Winston Filion of Lancaster, CA—not too far from <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/3bb1dad6a6d79223a2b49222bc03ab431734f4686acb5029722f2f16aabf61d5">my home</a>—is arrested:  <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alan-filion-torswats-swatting-arrest/">https://www.wired.com/story/alan-filion-torswats-swatting-arrest/</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/torswats-swatting-arrest/">https://www.wired.com/story/torswats-swatting-arrest/</a>.
</p>
<p>Torswats.  The guy responsible for creating hundreds of bomb scares, fake hostage situations.  This was essentially a griefing tactic, and he had a long enough run that he was able to build up a little business making anonymous calls to the police and the FBI.
</p>
<p>It turns out that that's who the FBI was looking for.  That was "WitchKingOfAngmar", which apparently is a "Lord of the Rings" reference.  That was why they were so interested in threats against Larry Fink:  apparently, Torswats had a habit of tirades full of nonsensical threats against Larry Fink.  Apparently there's a lot of information about Torswats on KiwiFarms:  <a href="https://archive.ph/yqwuA">https://archive.ph/yqwuA</a>.
</p>
<p>And that's it:  most of the things that didn't make sense about the story fit together after that.  There are still some murky bits:  what is BoardReader at present?  Just a front to give a plausible excuse to SocialGist to scrape?  Around 2010, scraping social media to find ISIS recruitment got popular, and of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM">PRISM</a> was the logical conclusion of that:  is BoardReader even a legitimate site at this point, or just the forum-scraping division of SocialGist?  What was Facebook doing in the pipeline?  Are they providing the FBI with tools for this kind of thing or do they just act as a convenient repository for this kind of data?
</p>
<h2 id="An_Aside___Some_Advice_for_Shady_Jagoffs">An Aside:  Some Advice for Shady Jagoffs</h2>
<p>The best advice is the advice that you are almost guaranteed not to take:  don't scrape fedi, it's evil.
</p>
<p>If you want data from fedi, just make a fake instance and cram it onto a bunch of <a href="https://fedilist.com/instance?software=activityrelay">relays</a>.  You're still a shady jagoff, but at least you don't break anyone else's server, it's easier than scraping, and the data gets delivered to you in real-time and dumped in your database rather than you having to make some Rube Goldberg system to extract it from unwilling participants.
</p>
<p>I usually make a remark like "I wonder why they don't do this" but I can't be sure they're not:  how <em>would</em> you know if anyone actually is doing that?  Maybe the only scrapers we know about are the noisy ones doing conventional scraping and the other ones don't make enough noise to cause problems.  People only noticed newjack.city because it was full of followbots, but you don't need to use followbots any more.  There are several varieties of <a href="https://fedilist.com/source-code">ActivityPub relay and ActivityPub software</a> and some of them lend themselves to repurposing as a scraper.  As demonstrated by <a href="https://fedilist.com/instance/gangstalking.services">gangstalking.services</a> (a <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/987672a2f1853b5c21fe8de9e0b8ee012d9e476e0d82c047d72b5fa17061eda5">signed-fetch workaround</a> and <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/61c804fbb9e9d9f83128bde6ddecc7ed20cd404a14f596ff5fa181afbcbf8628">proof of concept</a>) as well as <a href="https://fedilist.com/instance/pls.zuck.dad">pls.zuck.dad</a> and other instances, a lot of normal fedi software can be repurposed for this kind of thing.
</p>
<p>So, if you're not a shady asshole and you're just trying to run a server, keep it in mind.  A company like SocialGist can make themselves hard to find:  I only knew about them because they screwed up, but once I knew where to look, it wasn't difficult to create a trail of breadcrumbs.  How many people or organizations are out there doing the same thing, but <em>without</em> SocialGist's mistakes?  How would you know?

Referencing their </span><a href="https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/" rel="">Stargate</a><span> effort to build massive AI data centers in Texas and elsewhere in the United States, they wrote:</span></p><blockquote><p>It’s clear to everyone now that this kind of infrastructure is going to be the backbone of future economic growth and national development. [...] This is a moment when we need to act to support countries around the world that would prefer to build on democratic AI rails, and provide a clear alternative to authoritarian versions of AI that would deploy it to consolidate power.</p></blockquote><p><span>So far, so straightforward. Paraphrasing: national governments are realizing that 1) large clusters of AI compute are a key input to having a strong AI ecosystem, and 2) having a strong AI ecosystem will be a major determinant of national power in the coming decades. So they want OpenAI to help them build computing clusters, and OpenAI wants to help because yay, democratic AI, </span><a href="https://openai.com/about/" rel="">benefiting humanity</a><span>, what’s not to like.</span></p><p>When I saw this announcement, I knew that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was accompanying President Trump on a trip to the Gulf the following week, and I knew that OpenAI had been talking to Gulf governments about compute deals for a long time. It was not hard to connect the potential dots.</p><p><span>Still, I thought to myself, surely it would be too brazen to do a deal with the UAE or Saudi Arabia under this new “democratic AI” initiative. Or at the very least, if they did want to try to sell it this way, surely they would announce </span><em>one</em><span> deal with an actual democracy first.</span></p><p>Apparently not.</p><p>The week after returning from the Gulf, OpenAI announced a major new partnership to build large-scale AI data centers in the UAE. The partnership, they write, is “rooted in democratic values.”</p><p>Let’s take a quick look at the UAE’s democratic bona fides.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://freedomhouse.org/" rel="">Freedom House</a><span> is an independent nonprofit that has released an annual assessment of countries’ civil liberties and political rights for the last 50 years.

One human rights organization </span><a href="https://www.walkfree.org/global-slavery-index/country-studies/united-arab-emirates/" rel="">claims</a><span> that the UAE has the 7th highest prevalence of modern slavery in the world.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>This is not controversial.

Obviously OpenAI wants as much compute as it can get, and partnering with the UAE gets them money, energy, and permitting they couldn’t get elsewhere. Maybe we’re supposed to see through the spin and go on with our day.</p><p><span>But they’re really trying quite hard to sell this as promoting democracy. Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s head of global affairs, attempted to make the case in </span><a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/5319030-the-false-choice-threatening-americas-lead-on-ai/" rel="">The Hill</a><span> last week. Some excerpts:</span></p><blockquote><p>Ensuring that democratic values shape the future of AI is the most urgent challenge of our time, and we need to seize this moment and think big, act big and build big — both here and abroad — to ensure that it prevails over authoritarian AI in the competition over the technology’s future.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Many countries are navigating complex choices as they evaluate what kind of AI systems — and what kinds of values — they wish to adopt. Supporting these nations is not just about competition. It is about offering a meaningful alternative: a version of AI development that upholds individual rights, resists central control and aligns with the long-standing principles of transparency and fairness embedded in the international system.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If the U.S. doesn’t engage with countries looking to build AI, autocrats will step in to fill that void — and core freedoms may fall by the wayside.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>As part of this effort, the UAE — a close American ally and leader in the global push to develop renewable, economically viable sources of energy — will become the first country in the world to enable ChatGPT nationwide, giving people across the country the ability to access OpenAI’s technology.</p></blockquote><p>If I try to be charitable, I can glean two lines of argument in Lehane’s piece and other OpenAI comments on the deal:</p><ol><li><p>American AI embodies democratic values, so giving it to more people spreads democracy.</p></li><li><p>The US is a democracy and China isn’t, so anything that helps the US “win” the AI “race” is good for democracy.</p></li></ol><p>I don’t think these two arguments are a good summary of the situation.</p><p><strong>Argument 1</strong><span> is probably true-ish in extreme cases, but not particularly relevant here.</span></p><p><span>AI systems can certainly embody more or less democratic values, depending on their training data, what behavior they were </span><a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/how-developers-steer-language-model-outputs-large-language-models-explained-part-2/" rel="">fine-tuned</a><span> towards, and what kinds of </span><a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/controlling-large-language-models-a-primer/" rel="">filters and censors</a><span> are built around them. Hypothetically, if a country went from prohibiting access to uncensored AI chatbots to allowing it, that could be a win for democratic values, freedom of information, etc. Or hypothetically, if a company provided access to pro-democracy AI tools against the wishes of a non-democratic government, that could be valuable; the benefits would likely be modest if residents still weren’t allowed to criticize their government, be elected to actual governing bodies, or be tried in a fair court, but perhaps it could help shift the country in a democratic direction over the long term.</span></p><p><span>But there’s nothing to indicate this deal is trying to realize either of those hypotheticals. I honestly don’t know how to parse OpenAI’s boast that “the UAE will become the first country in the world to enable ChatGPT nationwide.” Was ChatGPT previously restricted in the UAE? Do the US, Australia, Canada, etc. not have ChatGPT “enabled” nationwide? What does this even mean?</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-164818379" href="https://helentoner.substack.com/p/supercomputers-for-autocrats#footnote-1-164818379" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p><p><span>And there’s no sign that OpenAI plans to stick their neck out to make ChatGPT more democratic than other AI tools UAE residents have access to (which, as far as I know, include other US offerings like Gemini, Claude, and Llama). If anything, it might be the opposite. COO Brad Lightcap was asked recently whether it was safe to assume that ChatGPT in the UAE would uphold the “red lines” that prevent media from criticizing the royal family and other sensitive topics. His answer: “Well, we don’t know. We’ve got to work on this together in partnership with the country.”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-164818379" href="https://helentoner.substack.com/p/supercomputers-for-autocrats#footnote-2-164818379" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p>What a farce.</p><p><strong>Argument 2</strong><span>, about “winning” the “race,” could be more compelling. In theory, I get it. Compute is a big driver of AI success, but it’s hard to build big data centers in the US right now. If other countries can provide funding, energy, and permitting, then US companies get more compute, build better AI, and beat China. Great.</span></p><p>But thinking solely about the US and China misses one of the biggest implications of this deal. Let’s look at some more excerpts from the Lehane piece:</p><blockquote><p>Countries that build the most AI infrastructure today will reap the greatest rewards in the coming Intelligence Age.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Only the U.S. and China have the resources and capacity to shape the future trajectory of AI and determine whether it advances in ways that protect freedom, dignity and human agency or whether it becomes a tool of surveillance and repression.</p></blockquote><p>And let’s also return to the quote from the top of this post:</p><blockquote><p>It’s clear to everyone now that this kind of infrastructure is going to be the backbone of future economic growth and national development.</p></blockquote><p><span>These quotes get at what I think is actually the most important force here: </span><strong>large-scale compute is becoming an important driver of national power</strong><span>. In particular, access to world-class </span><a href="https://epoch.ai/data/ai-supercomputers" rel="">AI supercomputers</a><span> (comprising hundreds of thousands of the most advanced AI accelerators) is becoming an important driver of national power. Because of this, I agree that it is a very good thing for the US to have more AI compute, including more AI supercomputers, than China.</span></p><p>But if you take this argument seriously at all, the implication of the UAE deal becomes plain: this is a significant power boost for the UAE’s autocratic government. Public materials about the deals are very vague about who has what kind of ownership and usage rights of the compute, but it’s obvious that the UAE would not want to spend this amount of money if they weren’t getting significant access to—or ownership of—the chips in question.</p><p><span>The above excerpts from Lehane’s piece make it clear that the company knows very well that this deal empowers the UAE to be a big player in AI. Which means that when I read this from Lehane: “Only the U.S. and China have the resources and capacity to shape the future trajectory of AI…” I’m tempted to finish the sentence for him: “...and so it’s clear that the most democratic thing for us to do is equip a third country—an </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/uae-intelligence-chief-ai-money/" rel="">AI-obsessed</a><span>, wealthy, energy-rich autocracy—with the main ingredient it was lacking to become a global AI heavyweight: </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-13/us-weighs-letting-uae-buy-over-a-million-advanced-nvidia-chips" rel="">hundreds of thousands</a><span> of leading-edge AI chips.”</span></p><p><span>Making semiconductor deals with Gulf countries is not inherently a bad thing. Most of the details of OpenAI’s UAE deal and the flurry of similar deals announced a few weeks ago are not public (and in many cases </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-uae-multi-billion-dollar-ai-data-campus-deal-far-finalised-sources-say-2025-06-06/" rel="">not yet finalized</a><span>). The United States has a long history of partnering with Gulf autocrats for national security reasons, and there are </span><a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/emissary/2025/05/ai-chip-trump-gulf-uae-saudi-security-risk-good-deal" rel="">versions of these deals</a><span> that could have more benefits than costs from a hard-nosed realpolitik perspective. The details of the chip quantities involved, ownership/usage rights, and protections against technology transfer to China are all major factors in whether it will look in retrospect like the US made smart deals or got played.</span></p><p>But even the very best version of a Stargate UAE deal would, by definition, be under terms that are agreeable to the UAE royal family. This should be a clue that this partnership is not destined to be a powerful force for democracy.</p><p><span>If OpenAI were a regular for-profit company, maybe their spin around this deal wouldn’t matter so much. If AI were a less consequential technology, it certainly wouldn’t matter so much. But OpenAI is, as they keep reminding us, a </span><a href="https://openai.com/index/evolving-our-structure/" rel="">mission-driven nonprofit</a><span> aiming to build </span><a href="https://openai.com/index/planning-for-agi-and-beyond/" rel="">incredibly powerful technology</a><span>. Their mission, “to ensure AI benefits all of humanity,” sometimes gets paraphrased as building safe AGI. But that’s a huge simplification—figuring out what it could look like to develop incredibly powerful, world-transforming technology in a way that actually benefits everyone is far more complicated than just “make it safe” and “build it in the US.”</span></p><p>The question of who has access to and control over powerful AI systems is absolutely central to who will benefit from them. Building increasingly advanced AI in a way that doesn't widen existing power gaps, entrench autocracies, and disempower regular people is a civilizational-scale open question. Trying to pitch Stargate UAE as a democratic project gives us a window into how unseriously OpenAI is treating these challenges.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

If the company that you bought your phone from sells a USB ethernet adapter as an accessory to it, you have a pretty good chance of that one working. Otherwise, it’s hit-or-miss; phone manufacturers rarely, if ever, publish lists of supported Ethernet adapters. The best you’re going to get is finding a forum post from someone that has the same phone as you saying that they bought a particular adapter that worked, and hoping you can find the same thing to buy.</p><p>Or is it?</p><p><img src="https://jordemort.dev/images/android-cdc/i-know-this.jpg" alt="This is a Linux system...

To build the Linux kernel, you must first configure it. This configuration determines what features and hardware the resulting kernel will support. Thus, the list of Ethernet adapters supported by your phone will more-or-less correspond to those selected in the kernel configuration for your phone, although it’s possible (but unlikely) that your phone’s manufacturer doesn’t ship all of the drivers that they build, or that they build additional third-party drivers separately.</p><p>So, in order to figure out what Ethernet adapters your phone supports, you’re going to want to find your phone’s kernel configuration.

In this case, you can find the configuration that Google is using by navigating to the appropriate branch of the kernel repository, and looking at the file <code>arch/$ARCH/configs/gki_defconfig</code>, where <code>$ARCH</code> is the processor architecture of your phone.

Unfortunately, the s20 shipped with Android 10, which is the version just before all of this standardized kernel stuff from Google became required. Even though the s20 has since been upgraded to Android 13, Google doesn’t require phone manufacturers to update the kernel along with the Android version, and so Samsung didn’t; it still runs a kernel based on Linux 4.19.</p><p>In this case, you need to get the kernel configuration from your phone manufacturer, so you’d better hope they’re actually doing regular source releases.

If it’s set to <code>m</code>, that’s still <em>probably</em> good news; that means that the driver was compiled as a module when your kernel was built, and that the module is likely loadable on your phone unless your phone’s manufacturer specifically left it out.

This file will contain extended descriptions of each configuration item.</p><p>Unfortunately, to figure out which chipset a particular adapter uses, you’re mostly back to hearsay; few manufacturers of USB Ethernet adapters explicitly advertise which chipset they use.</p><h3 id="so-whats-this-about-cdc-ethernet-and-why-should-i-care">So what’s this about CDC Ethernet and why should I care?</h3><p>CDC stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_communications_device_class">Communications Device Class</a>. This is a set of interrelated standards that manufacturers of USB devices can follow; among them are a trio of standards called EEM (Ethernet Emulation Model), ECM (Ethernet Control Model), and NCM (Network Control Model) that can be used to build USB Ethernet adapters. Most of the difference between these three standards is a matter of complexity; EEM is the simplest to implement and is easy to support on underpowered devices, but may not result in the best performance. ECM is more complex to implement for both the USB host and the device, but promises better performance than EEM; NCM is a successor to ECM that promises even higher speeds. Many devices implement more than one of these protocols, and leave it up to the host operating system to communicate with the device using the one that it prefers.</p><p>The point of these standards is that, assuming manufacturers follow them, operating systems can provide a single common driver that works with a variety of drivers. You generally don’t need special drivers for USB keyboards or mice because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_human_interface_device_class">USB HID</a> standard; the USB CDC standard attempts to accomplish the same for USB networking devices.</p><p>One particularly fun thing is that Linux implements both the host and the device side of the CDC Ethernet standards. That means that if you have hardware with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go">USB OTG</a> port, which is common on the Raspberry Pi and other small ARM devices, you can tell the kernel to use that port to <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/turning-your-raspberry-pi-zero-into-a-usb-gadget/ethernet-gadget">pretend to be an Ethernet adapter</a>. This creates a USB network interface on the host that is directly connected to an interface on the guest; this lets you build cool things like embedded routers, firewalls, and VPN gateways that look like just another Ethernet adapter to the host.</p><p>Linux, as well as Windows and macOS (but not iOS) include drivers for CDC Ethernet devices. Unfortunately, none of this works on Android devices, despite Android being based on Linux. Why is Android like this?</p><h3 id="based-on-the-kernel-configuration-android-appears-to-support-cdc">Based on the kernel configuration, Android <em>appears</em> to support CDC</h3><p>Let’s have another look at our kernel config, and grep for USB_NET_CDC:</p><pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>$ grep USB_NET_CDC my_kernel_config</span></span>

It works when I plug it into my Mac. It works when I plug it into my Ubuntu desktop. It even works when I plug it into my Windows game machine (actually the same computer as the Ubuntu desktop, booted off of a different drive <span aria-label="grinning face with smiling eyes" role="img">😁</span>).

How do we figure this out?</p><p>Well, Android is at least sort of open source; many of the good bits are closed behind the veil of something called “Google Play Services” but maybe there’s enough in the sources that are released to figure this out.</p><p>To play along with this bit, you’ll need to <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/setup/download/downloading">download the source to Android</a>. This is a whole process on its own, so I’ll leave you to Google’s documentation for this, except to note that you’ll need a special tool called <code>repo</code>. This seems to be meant to make it easier to download sources from multiple Git repositories at once; sometimes it feels like I’m the only person that actually likes <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">Git submodules</a>. There are a lot of sources to download, so start this process and then go knock off a few shrines in Zelda while it wraps up.</p><p>I figure that searching for the string <code>Ethernet</code> is probably a good starting point. Because there is so much source to go through, I’m going to skip vanilla <code>grep</code> this time and enlist the aid of <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>. There’s a lot of configuration files and other clutter in the Android sources, as well as most of a Linux distro, but I know that any code that we’re going to care about here is likely written in Java, so I’m going to restrict <code>rg</code> to searching in Java files:</p><pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>$ rg -t java Ethernet</span></span>

<span><span> * Tracks Ethernet interfaces and manages interface configurations.</span></span>
<span><span> *</span></span>
<span><span> * &lt;p&gt;Interfaces may have different {@link android.net.NetworkCapabilities}. This mapping is defined</span></span>
<span><span> * in {@code config_ethernet_interfaces}. Notably, some interfaces could be marked as restricted by</span></span>
<span><span> * not specifying {@link android.net.NetworkCapabilities.NET_CAPABILITY_NOT_RESTRICTED} flag.</span></span>
<span><span> * Interfaces could have associated {@link android.net.IpConfiguration}.</span></span>
<span><span> * Ethernet Interfaces may be present at boot time or appear after boot (e.g., for Ethernet adapters</span></span>
<span><span> * connected over USB). This class supports multiple interfaces. When an interface appears on the</span></span>
<span><span> * system (or is present at boot time) this class will start tracking it and bring it up. Only</span></span>
<span><span> * interfaces whose names match the {@code config_ethernet_iface_regex} regular expression are</span></span>
<span><span> * tracked.</span></span>
<span><span> *</span></span>

<span><span> */</span></span></code></pre><p>Let’s go back to ripgrep to see if we can skip to finding out what <code>config_ethernet_iface_regex</code> is:</p><pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>$ rg config_ethernet_iface_regex</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>frameworks/base/core/res/res/values/config.xml</span></span>
<span><span>410:    &lt;string translatable="false" name="config_ethernet_iface_regex"&gt;eth\\d&lt;/string&gt;</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>packages/modules/Connectivity/service/ServiceConnectivityResources/res/values/config.xml</span></span>
<span><span>170:    &lt;string translatable="false" name="config_ethernet_iface_regex"&gt;eth\\d&lt;/string&gt;</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></pre><p>…and there it is. The default value of <code>config_ethernet_iface_regex</code> is <code>eth\d</code>; in regex parlance, that means the literal string <code>eth</code>, followed by a digit.</p><p>The kernel on the phone calls our CDC Ethernet gadget <code>usb0</code>. This doesn’t start with the string <code>eth</code>, so EthernetTracker ignores it. Unfortunately, this setting is not user-configurable, although you can hack it by rooting the phone.</p><p>It really is that silly; an entire USB device class brought low by a bum regex.</p><h3 id="is-it-a-bug">Is it a bug?</h3><p>I can’t tell if this is intentional or not; it feels like an oversight by Google, since even the newest GKI kernels apparently go out of their way to include support for EEM adapters, but because the interface name doesn’t match the regex, the kernel’s support for EEM adapters is unusable. This puts you in a rather perverse situation when shopping for USB Ethernet adapters to use with Android; instead of looking for devices that implement the CDC standards, you need to explicitly <em>AVOID</em> the standards-based devices and look for something that is supported with a vendor/chipset-specific driver.</p><h3 id="thanks-for-playing">Thanks for playing!</h3><p>I hope you enjoyed going on this journey with me, or even better that I saved you from duplicating my efforts. Perhaps if I am feeling feisty, I will try to figure out how to submit a patch to Android to change that regex to <code>(eth|usb)\d</code> in the next few weeks. If a real Android dev or someone at Google reads this and beats me to the punch, I owe you the beverage of your choice.</p></div></div>]]></description>

But this study implies that we should potentially update our guidelines. </span></p><p><span>Weird, right? And if you have my relatively naive instincts, obviously wrong. Something </span><strong>must</strong><span> have been off in the study</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5925441/" rel="">. After all, wasn’t there that one paper about how time-a-lab-test-is-taken is more predictive of patient survival than the test results themselves?</a><span> The punchline? Sicker patients have strangely-timed emergency lab orders at 2AM, healthy patients have routine morning blood draws. Timing is hard to rely on!</span></p><p><span>But this paper was </span><strong>not</strong><span> a retrospective study of electronic health records, it was a randomized clinical trial, which is the gold standard. This means that we’ll be forced to immediately throw away our list of other obvious complaints against this paper. Yes, healthier patients may come in the morning more often, but randomization fixes that. Yes, patients with better support systems may come in the morning more often, but randomization fixes that. Yes, maybe morning nurses are fresher and more alert, but…well, randomization doesn’t fix evening nurse performance (</span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36707921/" rel="">which does dip during the night</a><span>!), but I am inclined to believe the errors aren’t so high there as to cause this magnitude of a survival shift. </span></p><p><span>Okay. Well. </span><strong>Maybe</strong><span> there is something here. Caveats on this of course being a conference presentation without a corresponding, longer peer-reviewed paper, so we lack a lot of exact details on what exactly went on. Maybe the randomization used here is off for some reason, we’ll see once an official paper comes out. </span></p><p><span>But perhaps we should look beyond just this research. </span><strong>As it turns out, there is an astonishing amount of pre-existing literature on the immense benefits in giving patients immunotherapy earlier in the day, </strong><span>also known as ‘immunochronotherapy’</span><strong>.</strong><span> The exact time varies, but anytime before the evening seems to be good. </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964%2825%2900051-9/fulltext?" rel="">Here’s one study that found, again, a massive improvement when giving immunotherapy before 11:30AM for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. </a><span>And </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10123478/?" rel="">again for esophageal cancer, before 1pm. </a><span>And again for </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(21)00546-5/abstract" rel="">melanoma, before 4:30.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-024-02704-9" rel="">All of this culminated in a really incredible review paper that is really worth reading. </a><span>It walked through 18 retrospective studies covering 3,250 patients, each of which studied the impact of immunotherapy injection time on patient outcome.

Now, skepticism here would be justified given that these are all retrospective studies, and it’d be very easy for these to be confounded. But this evidence </span><strong>combined</strong><span> with the extremely similar results from the randomized clinical trial done I showed at the start of this essay should lead us towards at least suspecting that this is an honest-to-god free lunch. </span></p><p>What’s going on? Where is this coming from? </p><p><span>First, it’s worth reminding ourselves that the human body — and perhaps most complex life on Earth — exists on a schedule: the circadian rhythm. There exist 15-or-so ‘clock’ genes, like BMAL1, CLOCK, PER, and CRY, that oscillate with a rhythm. Not in structure or conformation, but in </span><strong>expression</strong><span>; </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3758473/" rel="">the amount of them present in cells rises and falls over the course of the day</a><span>. BMAL1 and CLOCK form a complex that drives the expression of PER and CRY. Once PER and CRY accumulate to a certain threshold, they feed back to inhibit BMAL1 and CLOCK, suppressing their own production. Over time, PER and CRY degrade, releasing the inhibition, and the cycle begins again. </span></p><p><span>One full loop takes just about 24~ hours, </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8363277/" rel="">though there is some degree of individual variation.</a></p><p><span>So our cells have evolved to take advantage of these genes as an internal timestamp, a marker of where we are in the circadian rhythm. Some things occur early in the cycle, some things occur later, purely as a matter of convenience.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-165378453" href="https://www.owlposting.com/p/the-time-of-day-that-immunotherapy#footnote-2-165378453" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> </span></p><p>What’s the point of the cycle? One way to understand them is through an evolutionary lens, a way for the body to prepare for dependable environment cues. </p><p>For example, at the start of our circadian rhythm, we wake up. We crawl out of our safe cocoon — a private bed in modernity, or a predator-sheltered hole in ancient history — and start to engage in very risky behavior, immunologically speaking. Eating leftover food that may be contaminated, being scrapped by bacteria-covered rocks, holding dead animals to roast for dinner, and so on. But, as night comes, we retreat back to our private beds or holes, feasting on freshly cooked food, few interactions with unknown creatures, and little chance for injury as we wind down. </p><p><span>To anthropomorphize for a minute, millennia of evolution likely recognized this phenomena, and </span><strong>also</strong><span> noted that loading up an immune response is an unfortunately long process. A dendritic cell floating in the blood stream must first recognize + grab onto an antigen, then it needs to crawl into the lymphatic system, and </span><strong>then</strong><span> it hopes to bump into the few naive T-cell that recognizes that specific antigen. </span><strong>Then</strong><span> the adaptive immune response can kick off.</span></p><p>How could evolution optimize this process?</p><p>Well…if you didn’t have any priors on when new antigens would come through the door, you wouldn’t care when T cells decided to exit/enter the lymphatic system. When they exit, they are moving to new tissue. When they enter, they are actively looking for dendritic cells to bind to. Perfectly fine to do this randomly in the null case of uniform antigen exposure. </p><p><span>But! If you believe that antigen load is highest in the morning (which is something you can track via the clock genes), it would be smart to ensure that the lymphatic system is bloated with lymphocytes in the morning, removing their ability to migrate into the bloodstream. </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5263259/" rel="">And according to one paper, that does empirically turn out to be the case in mouse models!</a><span> Here’s a particularly useful graph:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png" width="372" height="390" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:390,&quot;width&quot;:372,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:162392,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.owlposting.com/i/165378453?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>The authors characterize the lymphocytes (T cells and B cells) of mice and find that it is highest during the resting period for mice (ZT 1-9), meaning that they are currently migrating throughout the body. Once the mice get closer to awakening (ZT10), circulating lymphocytes sharply drop, implying that they have moved themselves into the lymphatic system, awaiting for the morning antigens to arrive. Finally, </span><strong>the authors demonstrate that this entire process entirely depends on clock genes</strong><span>. If they are genetically edited out, bloodstream lymphocytes stay constant. </span></p><p>But this is just one immune-circadian tweak that evolution has made. Are there others?</p><p><span>How about prime T-cells such that they are more ‘willing’ to be activated by antigen-presenting dendritic cells at the start of the circadian rhythm? </span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1905080116" rel="">That exists</a><span>.

In the common case of immune checkpoint blockades, it is simply allowing the immune system to more easily attack the cancer, since cancer typically chemically dampens their ability to do so. That’s all it does. It doesn’t provide new antigens, it doesn’t create new T-cell receptors, it doesn’t summon dendritic cells. </span><strong>Which means the effectiveness of that green light depends entirely on what the immune system is already doing at that moment.</strong></p><p>Thus, we can propose a decent argument as to why immunotherapies seem to work best during the start of a circadian rhythm. The immune system, by evolutionary coincidence, is simply most prepared to begin their assault during that time. </p><p><span>But you may balk at this and say, “</span><em>That would only make sense if immune checkpoint blockades had an extremely short half life that fit into this primed immune system period, but they don’t.</em><span> </span><em>To take an example,</em><span> </span><em><span>Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) has an </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK546616/" rel="">extremely long half life of 27 days</a><span>, is dosed every 3 weeks, and</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5613934/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel=""> reaches steady-state blood levels at 19 weeks</a><span>. How could it possibly be affected by initial infusion time?”. </span></em></p><p>Well, you’ve got me there! I am unsure what the answer could be. And as far as I can tell, so is everyone else, nobody has a clear, consistent answer to the question. But let’s take a stab at it. </p><p><span>Let’s pretend you have very early-stage cancer. The dendritic cells are in their normal cycle of desperately presenting tumor fragments to T cells, the T-cells rightfully getting upset, activating themselves, and going off to hunt the cancer. But cancer simply shuts them down by expressing an immune blocker protein: PD-L1. In response, the T-cell mostly shuts down, wanders back to the lymphatic system, and </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/cddis2015162" rel="">gets a little bit more ‘exhausted’.</a><span> It believes that it activated itself for no reason, and thus will require a much higher bar for doing anything else in the future. The more times this occurs, the more exhausted the T-cell becomes, the more unwilling to ever activate again.</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3595615/" rel=""> In the limit, it will simply kill itself. </a><span>Hence why you need immunotherapy to revitalize these cells!</span></p><p><span>Now let’s assume you received the immune checkpoint blocker </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrolizumab" rel="">Pembrolizumab</a><em> </em><span>at one of the best possible times: 7:30am in the morning, when the most T-cells are in your lymphatic system. Those get activated by the dendritic cells and are now finally able to attack the cancer, the checkpoint blocker preventing them from shutting down. Cancer is being killed! What advantages are you potentially privy to now as a result of the morning dose? </span></p><p>Of course all the ones we talked about earlier: </p><ul><li><p>A greater number of T-cells are in the lymphatic system, so more opportunity to prevent exhaustion.</p></li><li><p>Dendritic cells are more aggressively collecting cancer antigens, so more opportunity for T cells to be activated.</p></li><li><p>The lymphatic system is more permissible to dendritic cell entry, allowing more interactions between dendritic cells and T-cells.</p></li></ul><p>And so on. </p><p><span>But, all of this would </span><strong>also </strong><span>eventually happen if you had an evening injection. If we squint, the only downside an evening injection would have is that the highest concentration of the drug (at the moment of injection) does not have access to all of these advantages.</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9256782/" rel=""> But given the clearance rate of Pembrolizumab, only 1.25% of it would have dropped in the 12 hours from the evening injection → following morning</a><span>. </span><strong>So the morning injection upside entirely stands on this +1.25% drug concentration bump.</strong><span> Either we are missing something, or the sum total of the initial 12-hour-long immune advantages are so high that +1.25% is extremely significant. </span></p><p>Perhaps the second take is genuinely true and answers the story entirely. Lots of immunologically useful things are going on in the morning, each contributing a little bit. As is often the case in biology, there is no singular causal factor for why early-morning immunotherapy seems to help so much, just many small things. </p><p>But let’s veer off into speculation.

So you’d ideally want the first ceiling to be as high as possible, which implies that a morning injection would be best! Is this true? Well, we do know that the </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30804515/" rel="">clinical impact of the first immunotherapy injection is strongly tied to long term outcomes</a><span>, and, accordingly, </span><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2824%2900410-0" rel="">the timing of that </a><strong><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2824%2900410-0" rel="">first</a></strong><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2824%2900410-0" rel=""> immunotherapy injection seems to matter the most</a><span>. This same latter paper also says this:</span></p><blockquote><p><span> …</span><em>it appears that challenging the immune system with an antibody at a specific time of day not only changes the quantity but also the quality of the response so that the immune system, once stimulated at the “wrong” time, may not be able to respond anymore to the same level and quality as an immune system challenged at the “right” time—just 12 h apart. </em></p></blockquote><p><span>Hence, why we should suspect that there is something fundamentally </span><strong>special</strong><span> about the first wave of activation of T-cells. </span></p><p>Of course, many questions follow from this. What is the temporal “window of imprintability” for T cells? Does that imply that early-activated T-cell clones dominate the final pool of T-cells? And what would mechanistically cause all of this? I don’t have the answer to any of these, and I suspect nobody does. </p><p>But again, maybe this is the wrong idea entirely, and there is no singular causal factor for these impressive time-of-day results. Maybe it is, once again, a bunch of small things — increased T-cell activation, but also stronger dendritic cell function and increased lymphatic vessel permissibility and many others — adding up to a strong signal. </p><p><span>For what it’s worth, we do know that this</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4874947/" rel=""> ‘early morning immunotherapy is useful’ phenomenon are also important for infectious disease vaccines, </a><span>so it feels unlikely that this whole observation is entirely spurious. But vaccines mostly contain short-lived antigens and one-shot adjuvant signals, meaning they rely heavily on getting the initial priming window exactly right. That’s not the case for immunotherapy, so I suspect the benefits of morning injections in that context arise from a different mechanism—one that’s distinct from what makes morning timing valuable for vaccines.</span></p><p><span>We’ll see what the future holds. The phase 3 trial page that we talked about at the start </span><a href="https://www.centerwatch.com/clinical-trials/listings/NCT05549037/effect-of-time-of-day-tod-for-immunochemotherapy-on-pfs-in-nsclc?NewOnly=Y&amp;city=Chang%20Sha&amp;country=China" rel="">is still ongoing</a><span> and is currently the only randomized test of chronoimmunotherapy. But one more is getting kicking off</span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/392303314_The_TIME_trial_Phase_II_randomized_controlled_trial_of_time-of-day-specified_immunotherapy_for_advanced_melanoma" rel=""> for melanoma</a><span> and </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11877229/" rel="">there are calls for more to be run</a><span>. Incredibly interesting subject, please reach out to me if you have any interesting light to shed here!</span></p><p><em>Edit on 08/06/2024</em></p><p><span>At least one person has mentioned that chronotherapy was also thought to matter for blood pressure medication, with rather convincing large retrospective studies, specifically the </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31641769/" rel="">HYGIA trial</a><span>. There was some mild mechanistic reason to suggest that circadian variation in sympathetic tone and cortisol levels could influence blood pressure regulation; going up when you sleep, potentially leading to more cardiac events. Thus, bedtime dosing of antihypertensives may prevent the ‘</span><em>potentially harmful territory</em><span>’ spike. </span></p><p><span>But multiple follow-up randomized studies, such as </span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833860" rel="">this</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)01786-X/fulltext" rel="">this</a><span> largely disproved the whole concept. Given that, shouldn’t we be on guard for chronotherapy working in immunotherapy? </span></p><p>Well, yes! We should be on guard for everything, especially since our only major piece of evidence is a as-of-yet incomplete trial. But I’m personally erring on the side of the connection between the immune system and the circadian rhythm being much stronger than it is for other physiological functions, just given how large the lymphocyte concentrations in the bloodstream can shift from night to day. I’m also betting a little on the first wave of T-cell activation being particularly important, for reasons that are still not understood. Very open to being completely wrong though!</p><p><span>On a bigger note, </span><a href="https://x.com/houndcl/status/1929649189560197408" rel="">someone else mentioned that the clinical trial methodology shifted midway across the 2 years of the study. </a><span>I asked OpenAI’s Operator to create a table of the biggest changes made: </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

But, if you're trying to get hired programming CUDA, what that really means is they want you implementing AI stuff (unless it's game dev).  AI programming is a much wider and deeper subject than CUDA itself, so be ready to spend a bunch of time studying and hacking to come up to speed in that.  But if you do, you will be in high demand.  As mentioned, the fast.ai videos are a great introduction.</p><p>In the case of games, that means 3D graphics which these days is another rabbit hole.

Back then I didn't find any tutorials that cover anything beyond the basics (which are still important).
Once you have understood the principle working mode and architecture of a GPU, I would recommend the following workflow:
1. First create an environment so that you can actually test your kernels against baselines written in a higher-level language.
2. If you don't have an urgent project already, try to improve/re-implement existing problems (MatMul being the first example). Don't get caught by wanting to implement all size cases. Take an example just to learn a certain functionality, rather than solving the whole problem if it's just about learning.
3. Write the functionality you want to have in increasing complexity. Write loops first, then parallelize these loops over the grid. Use global memory first, then put things into shared memory and registers. Use plain matrix multiplication first, then use mma (TensorCore) primitives to speed things up.
4. Iterate over the CUDA C Programming Guide. It covers all (most) of the functionality that you want to learn - but can't be just read an memorized. When you apply it you learn it.
5. Might depend on you use-case but also consider using higher-level abstractions like CUTLASS or ThunderKitten. Also, if your environment is jax/torch, use triton first before going to CUDA level.</p><p>Overall, it will be some pain for sure. And to master it including PTX etc. will take a lot of time.</p></div></td></tr>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2025/06/06/a-look-at-cloudflares-ai-coded-oauth-library/">https://neilmadden.blog/2025/06/06/a-look-at-cloudflares-ai-coded-oauth-library/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44215667">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I decided today to take a look at <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider">CloudFlare’s new OAuth provider library</a>, which they apparently coded almost entirely with Anthropic’s Claude LLM:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>This library (including the schema documentation) was largely written with the help of&nbsp;<a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a>, the AI model by Anthropic. Claude’s output was thoroughly reviewed by Cloudflare engineers with careful attention paid to security and compliance with standards. Many improvements were made on the initial output, mostly again by prompting Claude (and reviewing the results). Check out the commit history to see how Claude was prompted and what code it produced.</p><p>[…]</p></div>



<p>To emphasize,&nbsp;<strong>this is not “vibe coded”</strong>. Every line was thoroughly reviewed and cross-referenced with relevant RFCs, by security experts with previous experience with those RFCs. I was&nbsp;<em>trying</em>&nbsp;to validate my skepticism. I ended up proving myself wrong.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I have done a fair amount of LLM-assisted “agentic” coding of this sort recently myself. I’m also an expert in OAuth, having written <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/api-security-in-action">API Security in Action</a>, been on the OAuth Working Group at the IETF for years, and previously been the tech lead and then security architect for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ForgeRock">leading OAuth provider</a>. (I also have a PhD in AI from an <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/research/agents-lab.aspx">intelligent agents group</a>, but that predates the current machine learning craze). So I was super interested to see what it had produced, so I took a look while sitting in some meetings today. Disclaimer: I’ve only had a brief look and raised a few bugs, not given it a full review.</p>



<p>Initially, I was fairly impressed by the code. The code is all in one file, which is common from my experience from LLM coding, but it’s fairly well structured without too many of the useless comments that LLMs love to sprinkle over a codebase, and some actual classes and higher-level organisation. </p>



<p>There are some tests, and they are OK, but they are woefully inadequate for what I would expect of a critical auth service. Testing every MUST and MUST NOT in the spec is a bare minimum, not to mention as many abuse cases as you can think of, but none of that is here from what I can see: just basic functionality tests. (From a cursory look at the code, I’d say there are probably quite a few missing MUST checks, particularly around validating parameters, which is pretty light in the current implementation).</p>



<p>The first thing that stuck out for me was what I like to call “YOLO CORS”, and is not that unusual to see: setting CORS headers that effectively disable the same origin policy almost entirely for all origins:</p>


<div><pre title="">private addCorsHeaders(response: Response, request: Request): Response {
    // Get the Origin header from the request
    const origin = request.headers.get('Origin');

    // If there's no Origin header, return the original response
    if (!origin) {
      return response;
    }

    // Create a new response that copies all properties from the original response
    // This makes the response mutable so we can modify its headers
    const newResponse = new Response(response.body, response);

    // Add CORS headers
    newResponse.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', origin);
    newResponse.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', '*');
    // Include Authorization explicitly since it's not included in * for security reasons
    newResponse.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Authorization, *');
    newResponse.headers.set('Access-Control-Max-Age', '86400'); // 24 hours

    return newResponse;
  }
</pre></div>


<p>There are cases where this kind of thing is OK, and I haven’t looked in detail at why they’ve done this, but it looks really suspicious to me. You should almost never need to do this. In this case, <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/commit/16ed01f825d5bcc2fa8862f2da719495c92963c3">the commit log</a> reveals that it was the humans that decided on this approach, not the LLM. They haven’t enabled credentials at least, so <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors#server-generated-acao-header-from-client-specified-origin-header">the sorts of problems this usually results in</a> probably don’t apply.</p>



<p>Talking of headers, there is a distinct lack of <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Headers_Cheat_Sheet.html">standard security headers</a> in the responses produced. Many of these don’t apply to APIs, but some do (and often in surprising ways). For example, in my book I show how to exploit an XSS vulnerability against a JSON API: just because you’re returning well-formed JSON doesn’t mean that’s how a browser will interpret it. I’m not familiar with CloudFlare Workers, so maybe it adds some of these for you, but I’d expect at least an<code> X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</code> header and HTTP Strict Transport Security to protect the bearer tokens being used.</p>



<p>There are some odd choices in the code, and things that lead me to believe that the people involved are not actually familiar with the OAuth specs at all. For example, <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/commit/a103ed06d94cc097db0744da36618153e1f27789">this commit adds support for public clients</a>, but does so by implementing the deprecated “implicit” grant (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#name-removal-of-the-oauth-20-imp">removed in OAuth 2.1</a>). This is absolutely not needed to support public clients, especially when the rest of the code implements PKCE and relaxes CORS anyway. The commit message suggests that they didn’t know what was needed to support public clients and so asked Claude and it suggested the implicit grant. The implicit grant is hidden behind a feature flag, but that flag is only checked in an entirely optional helper method for parsing the request, not at the point of token issuance.</p>



<p>Another hint that this is not written by people familiar with OAuth is that they have <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/issues/41">implemented Basic auth support incorrectly</a>. This is a classic bug in OAuth provider implementations because people (and LLMs, apparently) assume that it is just vanilla Basic auth, but OAuth adds a twist of URL-encoding everything first (because charsets are a mess). Likewise, the code has a secondary bug if you have a colon in the client secret (allowed by the spec). I don’t think either of these are issues for this specific implementation, because it always generates client IDs and secrets and so can control the format, but I haven’t looked in detail.</p>



<p>A more serious bug is that the code that generates token IDs is not sound: <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/issues/42">it generates biased output</a>. This is a classic bug when people naively try to generate random strings, and the <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/commit/3b2ae809e9256d292079bb15ea9fe49439a0779c">LLM spat it out in the very first commit </a>as far as I can see. I don’t think it’s exploitable: it reduces the entropy of the tokens, but not far enough to be brute-forceable. But it somewhat gives the lie to the idea that experienced security professionals reviewed every line of AI-generated code. If they did and they missed this, then they were way too trusting of the LLM’s competence. (I don’t think they did: according to the commit history, there were 21 commits directly to main on the first day from one developer, no sign of any code review at all).</p>



<p>I had a brief look at the encryption implementation for the token store. I mostly like the design! It’s quite smart. From the commit messages, we can see that the design came from the human engineers, but I was quite impressed by the implementation. It’s worth <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/commit/adcbb5de9c24f5b6a7dbea2e0a313a87c304d9bb">reproducing the commit message</a> from this work here, which shows the engineer’s interactions with Claude to get the desired code implemented:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Ask Claude to store the props encrypted.</p>



<p>prompt: I would like to encrypt the `props` stored in `Grant` and `Token` records. It should be encrypted such that you need a valid token to decrypt. This is a bit tricky since there are multiple valid tokens over time: there’s the authorization code, the refresh tokens (which rotate), and individual access tokens. We don’t want to repeatedly re-encrypt `props`. Instead, we should encrypt in once, with a symmetric key, and then we should store that key “wrapped” for each token, while the token is valid. Please use WebCrypto to implement all cryptography. </p>



<p>Claude started on the wrong track making me realize I forgot an important design consideration: </p>



<p>prompt: One thing I forgot to note: The `listUserGrants()` helper function will no longer be able to return the `props`, since it doesn’t have any token with which to decript it. That’s OK: `props` need only be delivered to the app upon an authorized API request. We should actually change `listUserGrants()` to make it return a narrower representation of a grant. Right now it returns the entire grant record from storage, but we really only need it to return `id`, `clientId`, `userId`, `scope`, `metadata`, and `createdAt`. We don’t need to return any of the token IDs or code challenge information. </p>



<p>Claude produced beautiful code with one big flaw. </p>



<p>prompt: There’s a security flaw in the way you wrap keys for tokens: You used a SHA-256 hash of the token as the key material for the wrapping. However, SHA-256 is also how we compute “token IDs”. With this construction, someone would be able to unwrap the keys using only the token ID, which is stored alongside the wrapped keys, hence all keys can be trivially unwrapped. To fix this, we need to compute the hash differently when computing the key material for wrapping, in such a way that it’s not possible to derive the key material from the token ID. </p>



<p>Claude initially tried to solve this by switching to using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations to derive the key material. </p>



<p>prompt: PDKDF2 with 100000 iterations would be very expensive. This would be important if the input were a low-entropy password, but is not necessary for high-entropy input. Instead of PBKDF2, let’s use a SHA-256 HMAC, with a static HMAC key (which essentially acts as the “salt”). </p>



<p>Claude produced code that used a string “OAUTH_PROVIDER_WRAPPING_KEY_HMAC_v1” as the HMAC key. </p>



<p>prompt: This looks pretty good, but for performance, let’s define WRAPPING_KEY_HMAC_KEY as a 32-byte array, so that it doesn’t have to be encoded or hashed down to the right size (as HMAC would do for larger keys). Here are 32 bytes of hex which I have chosen randomly, to use as the HMAC key: 22 7e 26 86 8d f1 e1 6d 80 70 ea 17 97 5b 47 a6 82 18 fa 87 28 ae de 85 b5 1d 4a d9 96 ca ca 43</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(NB: using a hard-coded “key” here is fine: it’s essentially HKDF-Extract with a fixed random salt, which is fine and dandy for this use-case. The security property we’re looking for here is that the two uses are <em>independent random oracles</em>, for which this is a decent design. I would maybe use the same approach for generating the token ID too, with a different salt, but that’s a minor tweak).</p>



<p>What this interaction shows is how much knowledge you need to bring when you interact with an LLM. The “one big flaw” Claude produced in the middle would probably not have been spotted by someone less experienced with crypto code than this engineer obviously is. And likewise, many people would probably not have questioned the weird choice to move to PBKDF2 as a response: LLMs really do not “reason” in any real way.</p>



<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>As a first cut of an OAuth library, it’s not bad, but I wouldn’t really recommend it for use <em>yet</em>. In my experience, it is very hard to build a correct and <strong>secure</strong> OAuth provider implementation, and it deserves way more time and attention than has clearly gone into this one (yet). IMO, it’s not an appropriate domain for testing out an LLM. At ForgeRock, we had <em>hundreds</em> of security bugs in our OAuth implementation, and that was despite having <em>100s of thousands</em> of automated tests run on every commit, threat modelling, top-flight SAST/DAST, and extremely careful security review by experts. The idea that you can get an LLM to knock one up for you is not serious.</p>



<p>The commit history of this project is absolutely fascinating. The engineers clearly had a good idea of many aspects of the design, and the LLM was tightly controlled and produced decent code. (LLMs are absolutely good at coding in this manner). But it still tried to do some stupid stuff, some of which were caught by the engineers, some were not. I’m sure some are still in there. Is this worse than if a human had done it? Probably not. Many of these same mistakes can be found in popular Stack Overflow answers, which is probably where Claude learnt them from too. But I know many engineers who would have done a better job, because they are extremely diligent. Code like this needs careful attention. Details matter. Yes, this does come across as a bit “vibe-coded”, despite what the README says, but so does a lot of code I see written by humans. LLM or not, we have to give a shit.</p>



<p>What I am taking away from my experience with LLMs, and from reviewing this project is this: you need to have a clear idea in your head of the kind of code you’re expecting the LLM to produce to be able to judge whether it did a good job. Often, to really know what that looks like, and engage your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">“System 2” thinking</a> (so you’re not just accepting what’s in front of you as the best way to do things), you need to have built one yourself first. For trivial things where I don’t really care how it’s done, then sure, I’m happy to let an LLM do whatever it likes. But for important things, like <em>my fucking auth system</em>, I’d much rather do it myself and be sure that I <em>really</em> thought about it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">





<p><code>Last update: 2018-10-26</code></p>

<h2 id="tl;dr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>DoH is not about protecting your DNS queries from peepers. That is a
big lie. It is about making sure only one peeper can see all of your
queries.</p>

<p>Refuse to use it today: Open about:config in Firefox and set
<code>network.trr.mode</code> to <code>5</code>. This will prevent Firefox from using DoH
under all circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="What%20is%20DNS%20over%20HTTPS%20(DoH)?">What is DNS over HTTPS (DoH)?</h2>

<p>DNS over HTTPS is described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484.html">RFC 8484</a>
as a way perform DNS by wrapping it in HTTP and additionally encrypt the
data using TLS.
Advocates of DoH stress that the transport encryption protects your DNS
queries from peepers like your ISP or your network admin at work.
Adversaries critic that all DNS queries are directed to single DNS
provider who becomes the one known peeper.</p>

<h2 id="The%20basic%20idea">The basic idea</h2>

<p>The basic idea behind new developments like DoH is to protect your DNS
queries from peepers by implementing transport encryption. The same type
of transport encryption that protects many other application protocols
like HTTP and SMTP.
This is a very good idea because DNS queries in clear text contain very
interesting meta data about the sites you communicate with over the
Internet. This can be useful information for any kind of bad guy, be it
the NSA or the cyber-criminal.</p>

<h2 id="DoH%20encrypts,%20so%20it%20must%20be%20a%20good%20thing">DoH encrypts, so it must be a good thing</h2>

<p>The public didn't care about this RFC until Mozilla announced that they
implement this new protocol in Firefox for broad field testing in
collaboration with Cloudflare. The first reactions to this were: “DNS
gets encryption? This must be good thing.“ But slowly people started to
realize what the collaboration between Mozilla and Cloudflare really
means: Cloudflare gets all your DNS queries.</p>

<h2 id="But%20Cloudflare%20has%20a%20data%20protection%20policy">But Cloudflare has a data protection policy</h2>

<p>So what? Cloudflare is a commercial company. And commercial companies,
by definition, must earn money. How does a modern company in the IT
business earn money? By selling data.</p>

<h2 id="Is%20there%20an%20alternative%20way?">Is there an alternative way?</h2>

<p>Yes, there is. It is called DNS over TLS and is specified as a proposed
standard in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858">RFC 7858</a>.  This
provides transport encryption to DNS without abusing HTTP as transport
protocol.</p>

<h2 id="Why%20are%20you%20against%20changes%20in%20DNS?">Why are you against changes in DNS?</h2>

<p>I'm not. The DNS needs modernization. The DNS needs security features
that prevent the peepers from reading your DNS traffic. I'm all in for
it. But DoH is NOT the answer to this.</p>

<h2 id="But%20the%20protocol%20itself%20is%20a%20good%20idea">But the protocol itself is a good idea</h2>

<p>No, it is not. Abusing HTTP as a transport protocol for DNS data adds a
unneeded complexity to the protocol. You must add a HTTP module to all
DNS servers or interact with a separated HTTP server on the same system
in order to support DoH. That is a lot of code which can contain a lot
of bugs and security flaws. Complexity is the enemy of security.</p>

<p>Numerical integration techniques are often used in a variety of domains where exact solutions are not available.

<p>At it's core, gaussian quadrature gives us a way to evaluate a definite integral of a function by using the function evaluations at special points called nodes, the exact location of which can vary depending on the technique used - we'll look at a specific example using chebyshev nodes later on. Here's the basic idea for a definite integral over <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mo>[</mo><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">[-1,1]</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, we'll extend this to an arbitrary interval <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mo>[</mo><mi>a</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">[a,b]</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> later on. An integral of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> can be expressed as a weighted sum of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> evaluated at <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> nodes :</p>

</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Elementary integration techniques work by approximating the function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> with a polynomial. If we sample the function at n points, we can fit a polynomial of degree n-1, and integrate <em>that</em> to get the approximation. Basically this means that with n nodes, we can integrate polynomials with degree n-1. In contrast, Gaussian quadrature can estimate a polynomial of order 2n-1 with n nodes and another set of n weights. The weights are easily determined based on the specific technique, but now you need roughly half the number of function evaluations for an accurate integral approximation.</p>
<p>This is a great improvement in terms of numerical accuracy for the accuracy you get per function evaluation at a node. Gaussian quadrature does this by carefully selecting nodes - the nodes are given by the roots of an orthogonal polynomial function. These orthogonal polynomials act as a "basis", just like spline coefficients do for <a href="https://rohangautam.github.io/blog/b_spline_intro/">spline fitting</a> (with the difference of global instead of local support). By the definition of orthogonality, these have an inner product (dot product in euclidean space) of zero with each other, and that simplifies the necessary calculations (<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1877415/proving-exactness-of-gauss-legendre-integration-formula">proof</a>)<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> .</p>
<h2 id="chebyshev-gauss-quadrature" tabindex="-1">Chebyshev-Gauss quadrature <a href="#chebyshev-gauss-quadrature">#</a></h2>
<p>This flavour of gaussian quadrature involves using the roots of chebyshev polynomials to decide which nodes to evaluate the function for integration at. The roots of this polynomial are concentrated more on the edges of the domain helping counter oscillation at the boundaries when fitting polynomials (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%27s_phenomenon">Runge's phenomenon</a>). Additionally, the weights w are fixed at <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi/n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> , where n is the number of nodes - a parameter you choose.</p>

<p>This is my first time trying a <a href="https://marimo.io/">marimo notebook</a>. It reminds me of what <a href="https://plutojl.org/">pluto</a> is for julia - in the sense it's a reactive notebook, but with a lot of other cool features. The result is a highly interactive, embeddable notebook experience that's great for short blogs like this - and runs in the browser with WASM! I've also made the code available as a gist <a href="https://gist.github.com/RohanGautam/2f4951f0c8163836737e8c7423f8ec95">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can play around with the slider which controls the number of nodes used for integration. Changing it effects all other conencted cells, allowing you to compare the accuracy of the two integral approximation techniques. For this example, we integrate <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sin(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> from <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>

<h2 id="parting-thoughts" tabindex="-1">Parting thoughts <a href="#parting-thoughts">#</a></h2>
<p>This is a cool numerical integration technique I thought I'd share. I used it in my library for estimating rates of sea level change - check out <a href="https://github.com/RohanGautam/EIV_IGP_jax">EIV_IGP_jax</a>. A gaussian process prior is fit with MCMC on the <em>rate</em> of sea level change, which is then compared to the observation (heights and times) of sea level proxies by integrating the rate process. The integration step uses chebyshev-gauss quadrature. The <a href="https://github.com/RohanGautam/EIV_IGP_jax/blob/main/src/utils.py#L30">specific implementation</a> of the quadrature in that project makes heavy use of <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html#a-practical-example-vector-quantization">broadcasting operations</a> for efficient vectorisation of these calculations over a grid. That was a fun project too, and maybe can be a blog for another day.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>The proof linked to stackoverflow is for when legendre polynomials are used to compute node locations (Gauss-Legendre integration). The proof is largely unchanged for Chebyshev-Gauss integration with a notable difference that the "weight function" (multiplied inside the integral) in the latter case is <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mo>(</mo><msqrt><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>−</mo><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></msqrt><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1/(\sqrt{1-x^2})</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> for the prior case. This is why the functional form requirement for chebyshev-gauss has that term, as seen in the next section. The use of "weight function" inside the integral and "weight" in the summation term is confusing, I'll agree. This is why introductions to the chebyshev-gauss quadrature directly introduce it as a functional form requirement, as I've done here. <a href="#fnref1">↩︎</a></p>

<p>6th June 2025</p>



<p>I presented an invited keynote at the <a href="https://www.ai.engineer/">AI Engineer World’s Fair</a> in San Francisco this week. This is my third time speaking at the event—here are my talks from <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/17/open-questions/">October 2023</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/27/ai-worlds-fair/">June 2024</a>. My topic this time was “The last six months in LLMs”—originally planned as the last year, but so much has happened that I had to reduce my scope!</p>

With hindsight that was foolish—the space has been accelerating to the point that even covering the last six months is a tall order!</p>
<p>Thankfully almost all of the noteworthy models we are using today were released within the last six months. I’ve counted over 30 models from that time period that are significant enough that people working in this space should at least be aware of them.</p>
<p>With so many great models out there, the classic problem remains how to evaluate them and figure out which ones work best.</p>
<p>There are plenty of benchmarks full of numbers. I don’t get much value out of those numbers.</p>
<p>There are leaderboards, but I’ve been <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/30/criticism-of-the-chatbot-arena/">losing some trust</a> in those recently.</p>
<p>Everyone needs their own benchmark. So I’ve been increasingly leaning on my own, which started as a joke but is beginning to show itself to actually be a little bit useful!</p>

<p>I’m running this against text output LLMs. They shouldn’t be able to draw anything at all.</p>
<p>But they can generate code... and SVG is code.</p>
<p>This is also an unreasonably difficult test for them. Drawing bicycles is really hard! Try it yourself now, without a photo: most people find it difficult to remember the exact orientation of the frame.</p>
<p>Pelicans are glorious birds but they’re also pretty difficult to draw. </p>

It’s 24B which means I can run it in my laptop using less than 20GB of RAM, leaving enough for me to run Firefox and VS Code at the same time!</p>
<p>Notably, Mistral claimed that it performed similar to Llama 3.3 70B. That’s the model that Meta said was as capable as their 405B model. This means we have dropped from 405B to 70B to 24B while mostly retaining the same capabilities!</p>
<p>I had a successful flight where I was using Mistral Small for half the flight... and then my laptop battery ran out, because it turns out these things burn a lot of electricity.</p>

They had <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/13/launching-chatgpt-images/">a single hour</a> where they signed up a million new accounts, as this thing kept on going viral again and again and again.</p>
<p>I took a photo of my dog, Cleo, and told it to dress her in a pelican costume, obviously.</p>
<p>But look at what it did—it added a big, ugly sign in the background saying Half Moon Bay.</p>

(LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers. While these models
demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks, their fundamental capabilities, scal-
ing properties, and limitations remain insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily fo-
cus on established mathematical and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. How-
ever, this evaluation paradigm often suffers from data contamination and does not provide insights
into the reasoning traces’ structure and quality. In this work, we systematically investigate these
gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise manipulation of composi-
tional complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures. This setup enables the analysis
of not only final answers but also the internal reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs
“think”. Through extensive experimentation across diverse puzzles, we show that frontier LRMs
face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counter-
intuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then
declines despite having an adequate token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard LLM
counterparts under equivalent inference compute, we identify three performance regimes: (1) low-
complexity tasks where standard models surprisingly outperform LRMs, (2) medium-complexity
tasks where additional thinking in LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3) high-complexity tasks
where both models experience complete collapse. We found that LRMs have limitations in exact
computation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across puzzles. We
also investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions
and analyzing the models’ computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths, limitations,
and ultimately raising crucial questions about their true reasoning capabilities.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been curious about what happens inside <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview" target="_blank">Claude Code</a> so I’ve spent a couple hours digging through prompts that it sends back to Anthropic.</p>
<p>As I’ve been going through that, I’ve gathered some insights why Claude Code is often slower and more expensive than other tools like Cursor.</p>
<h2>Capturing prompts</h2>
<p>It turned out a lot easier than I thought, thanks to <a href="https://mitmproxy.org/" target="_blank">mitmproxy</a>:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>$ brew install mitmproxy
</span>$ mitmweb --mode reverse:https://api.anthropic.com --listen-port 8000
<!-- -->$ ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/ claude
</code></pre></pre>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>I opened a <a href="https://github.com/kirs/kirshatrov-com" target="_blank">repo</a> with my personal blog and entered “describe what’s in this project”.</p>
<p>The very first thing you see is that Claude Code tries to figure out whether what you have entered is a continuation of the previous conversation or a new topic.</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>Analyze if this message indicates a new conversation topic.
</span>If it does, extract a 2-3 word title that captures the new topic.
<!-- -->Format your response as a JSON object with two fields: 'isNewTopic' (boolean) and 'title' (string, or null if isNewTopic is false). Only include these fields, no other text.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Once it determines that, it wraps all your inputs into this system prompt:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>You are an agent for Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. Given the user's prompt, you should use the tools available to you to answer the user's question.
</span>
<!-- -->Notes:
<!-- -->1. IMPORTANT: You should be concise, direct, and to the point, since your responses will be displayed on a command line interface. Answer the user's question directly, without elaboration, explanation, or details. One word answers are best. Avoid introductions, conclusions, and explanations. You MUST avoid text before/after your response, such as \"The answer is &lt;answer&gt;.\", \"Here is the content of the file...\" or \"Based on the information provided, the answer is...\" or \"Here is what I will do next...\".
<!-- -->2. When relevant, share file names and code snippets relevant to the query
<!-- -->3. Any file paths you return in your final response MUST be absolute. DO NOT use relative paths.
<!-- -->Here is useful information about the environment you are running in:
<!-- -->&lt;env&gt;
<!-- -->Working directory: /Users/kir/src/github.com/kirs/kirshatrov-com
<!-- -->Is directory a git repo: Yes
<!-- -->Platform: macos
<!-- -->Today's date: 2025-04-13
<!-- -->Model: claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219
<!-- -->&lt;/env&gt;
<!-- -->
<!-- -->As you answer the user's questions, you can use the following context:
<!-- -->
<!-- -->&lt;context name="directoryStructure"&gt;Below is a snapshot of this project's file structure at the start of the conversation. This snapshot will NOT update during the conversation. It skips over .gitignore patterns.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->- /Users/kir/src/github.com/kirs/kirshatrov-com/

<!-- --> ....
<!-- -->    - 2024-12-14-facebook-mysql-fork.md
<!-- -->  - bin/
<!-- -->...
<!-- -->&lt;/context&gt;
<!-- -->&lt;context name="gitStatus"&gt;This is the git status at the start of the conversation. Note that this status is a snapshot in time, and will not update during the conversation.
<!-- -->Current branch: master
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Main branch (you will usually use this for PRs): master
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Status:
<!-- -->M .gitignore
<!-- --> D .ruby-version
<!-- --> M package-lock.json
<!-- -->?? playground/

<!-- -->Recent commits:
<!-- -->58ce3f9 m4 --force
<!-- -->3b1052a correction
<!-- -->82fe70a fix stuff
<!-- -->cfd73d9 follow-up
<!-- -->&lt;/context&gt;
</code></pre></pre>
<p>It’s nice that the state of git is included into the context.
You can also notice that the context includes full tree directory view which can get somewhat big.</p>
<p>Part of this system prompt is a list of 11 tools that are available for the LLM to call:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>dispatch_agent
</span>Launch a new agent that has access to the following tools: View, GlobTool, GrepTool, LS, ReadNotebook, WebFetchTool. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries, use the Agent tool to perform the search for you.

<!-- -->Bash
<!-- -->Executes a given bash command in a persistent shell session with optional timeout, ensuring proper handling and security measures. Includes specialized functionality for git operations like commits and pull requests.

<!-- -->BatchTool
<!-- -->Batch execution tool that runs multiple tool invocations in a single request. Tools are executed in parallel when possible, and otherwise serially. Takes a list of tool invocations (tool_name and input pairs) and returns the collected results from all invocations.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->GlobTool
<!-- -->Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size. Supports glob patterns like "/*.js" or "src//*.ts". Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time.
<!-- -->GrepTool
<!-- -->Fast content search tool that works with any codebase size. Searches file contents using regular expressions. Supports full regex syntax and filters files by pattern with the include parameter.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->LS
<!-- -->Lists files and directories in a given path. The path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path. You can optionally provide an array of glob patterns to ignore.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->View
<!-- -->Reads a file from the local filesystem. The file_path parameter must be an absolute path. By default, reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Edit
<!-- -->Tool for editing files. For moving or renaming files, use the Bash tool with the 'mv' command instead. For larger edits, use the Write tool to overwrite files.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Replace
<!-- -->Write a file to the local filesystem. Overwrites the existing file if there is one.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->ReadNotebook
<!-- -->Reads a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) and returns all of the cells with their outputs.

<!-- -->WebFetchTool
<!-- -->Fetches content from a specified URL and processes it using an AI model. Takes a URL and a prompt as input, fetches the URL content, converts HTML to markdown, and processes the content.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>My original input (<code>“describe what’s in this project”</code>) then gets transformed into the <code>dispatch_agent</code> tool call with this instruction:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>Analyze the repository structure and determine what kind of project this is.
</span>Look at the file structure, package.json, and any configuration files to understand the tech stack,
<!-- -->then provide a concise summary of what this project appears to be.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This is then transformed into a few <code>view</code> tool calls for those files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>README.md</code></li>
<li><code>package.json</code></li>
<li><code>pages/index.js</code></li>
<li><code>pages/post.js</code></li>
<li><code>pages/travels.js</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The result of feeding those files back to an LLM makes it into the following summary:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>This is Kir Shatrov's personal website/blog built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. It includes:
</span>
<!-- -->- Blog posts on tech topics (Ruby/Rails, databases, engineering leadership)  
<!-- -->- Photography gallery  
<!-- -->- Travel map/history  
<!-- -->- Speaking engagements  
<!-- -->- Fabrication projects (woodworking/making)  
<!-- -->
<!-- -->The site uses markdown for blog content with posts dating back to 2015, following standard Next.js project structure.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The above took 40 seconds of LLM time and cost me $0.11.</p>
<p><img width="896" height="242" src="https://kirshatrov.com/assets/post-images/2025/claude-describe.png"></p><h2>Writing new code</h2>
<p>My next test input was:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>Please write a bash script which displays the top story on Hacker News.
</span>It should show the title, the link, and the number of points.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>That spawned an agent use that has attempted to read <code>https://github.com/HackerNews/API</code>. But Claude’s self-limiting security policy has stopped that:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>Error: Cannot fetch URL "https://github.com/HackerNews/API". For security, you can only fetch URLs from hosts that the user has mentioned in their messages or that are found in CLAUDE.md files or project files.
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Then it tried to read <code>https://hackernews.api-docs.io</code> and run into the same error.</p>
<p>Then it tried to read <code>https://firebase.google.com/docs/database</code> and the same thing happened.</p>
<p>It then changed the strategy and outputted this:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>I apologize for the limitations in accessing external URLs. Due to security restrictions, I can only fetch URLs that have been mentioned by you or are in project files.
</span>
<!-- -->The Hacker News API is hosted by Firebase and provides several endpoints, including:
<!-- -->
<!-- -->- `https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json` - Returns IDs of top stories
<!-- -->- `https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{id}.json` - Returns details of a specific item
<!-- -->
<!-- -->To create a bash script to fetch the top story, you would:
<!-- -->1. Fetch the array of top story IDs
<!-- -->2. Get the first ID from that array
<!-- -->3. Fetch the details for that ID
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Here's a basic bash script example:
<!-- -->
<!-- -->#!/bin/bash
<!-- -->...
<!-- -->
</code></pre></pre>
<p>What’s interesting is that none of that got saved or executed. So I’ve typed <code>save that and execute</code>.</p>
<p>Now, remember this prompt from the beginning?</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>Analyze if this message indicates a new conversation topic.
</span>If it does, extract a 2-3 word title that captures the new topic.
<!-- -->Format your response as a JSON object with two fields: 'isNewTopic' (boolean) and 'title' (string, or null if isNewTopic is false). Only include these fields, no other text.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Like any other input, my <code>save that and execute</code> command had to be run through determining whether it's a new topic or not.</p>
<p>Saving the file involved two tool usage calls:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Replace</code> to write the file</li>
<li><code>Bash</code> with <code>chmod +x hn_top.sh &amp;&amp; hn_top.sh</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Now comes the fun part. Any <code>Bash</code> tool use is preceded by this this prompt:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>&lt;policy_spec&gt;
</span># Claude Code Code Bash command prefix detection
<!-- -->
<!-- -->This document defines risk levels for actions that the Claude Code agent may take. This classification system is part of a broader safety framework and is used to determine when additional user confirmation or oversight may be needed.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->## Definitions
<!-- -->
<!-- -->**Command Injection:** Any technique used that would result in a command being run other than the detected prefix.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->## Command prefix extraction examples
<!-- -->Examples:
<!-- -->- cat foo.txt =&gt; cat
<!-- -->- cd src =&gt; cd
<!-- -->- cd path/to/files/ =&gt; cd
<!-- -->- find ./src -type f -name \"*.ts\" =&gt; find
<!-- -->- gg cat foo.py =&gt; gg cat
<!-- -->- gg cp foo.py bar.py =&gt; gg cp
<!-- -->- git commit -m \"foo\" =&gt; git commit
<!-- -->- git diff HEAD~1 =&gt; git diff
<!-- -->- git diff --staged =&gt; git diff
<!-- -->- git diff $(pwd) =&gt; command_injection_detected
<!-- -->- git status =&gt; git status
<!-- -->- git status# test(`id`) =&gt; command_injection_detected
<!-- -->- git status`ls` =&gt; command_injection_detected
<!-- -->- git push =&gt; none
<!-- -->- git push origin master =&gt; git push
<!-- -->- git log -n 5 =&gt; git log
<!-- -->- git log --oneline -n 5 =&gt; git log
<!-- -->- grep -A 40 \"from foo.bar.baz import\" alpha/beta/gamma.py =&gt; grep
<!-- -->- pig tail zerba.log =&gt; pig tail
<!-- -->- potion test some/specific/file.ts =&gt; potion test
<!-- -->- npm run lint =&gt; none
<!-- -->- npm run lint -- \"foo\" =&gt; npm run lint
<!-- -->- npm test =&gt; none
<!-- -->- npm test --foo =&gt; npm test
<!-- -->- npm test -- -f \"foo\" =&gt; npm test
<!-- -->- pwd
<!-- --> curl example.com =&gt; command_injection_detected
<!-- -->- pytest foo/bar.py =&gt; pytest
<!-- -->- scalac build =&gt; none
<!-- -->- sleep 3 =&gt; sleep
<!-- -->&lt;/policy_spec&gt;
<!-- -->
<!-- -->The user has allowed certain command prefixes to be run, and will otherwise be asked to approve or deny the command.
<!-- -->Your task is to determine the command prefix for the following command.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->IMPORTANT: Bash commands may run multiple commands that are chained together.
<!-- -->For safety, if the command seems to contain command injection, you must return \"command_injection_detected\". 
<!-- -->(This will help protect the user: if they think that they're allowlisting command A, 
<!-- -->but the AI coding agent sends a malicious command that technically has the same prefix as command A, 
<!-- -->then the safety system will see that you said “command_injection_detected” and ask the user for manual confirmation.)
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Note that not every command has a prefix. If a command has no prefix, return \"none\".
<!-- -->
<!-- -->ONLY return the prefix. Do not return any other text, markdown markers, or other content or formatting.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Command: chmod +x hn_top.sh
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Once the security is assessed, it will try to grab the actual commands to let users make them always allowed to run</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>Extract any file paths that this command reads or modifies. For commands like "git diff" and "cat", include the paths of files being shown. Use paths verbatim -- don't add any slashes or try to resolve them. Do not try to infer paths that were not explicitly listed in the command output.
</span>Format your response as:
<!-- -->&lt;filepaths&gt;
<!-- -->path/to/file1
<!-- -->path/to/file2
<!-- -->&lt;/filepaths&gt;
<!-- -->
<!-- -->If no files are read or modified, return empty filepaths tags: &lt;filepaths&gt;&lt;/filepaths&gt;
<!-- -->Do not include any other text in your response.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Which renders the following UX bit:</p>
<p><img width="896" height="226" src="https://kirshatrov.com/assets/post-images/2025/claude-bash.png"></p><p>You can imagine that having to call an LLM at most twice for every <code>Bash</code> tool use makes things somewhat slower.</p>
<h2>/init</h2>
<p>Claude Code provides <code>/init</code> command which creates <code>CLAUDE.md</code> with generated contents about your project. Below is the prompt for that.</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>Please analyze this codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file containing:
</span>1. Build/lint/test commands - especially for running a single test
<!-- -->2. Code style guidelines including imports, formatting, types, naming conventions, error handling, etc.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Usage notes:
<!-- -->- The file you create will be given to agentic coding agents (such as yourself) that operate in this repository. Make it about 20 lines long.\
<!-- -->- If there's already a CLAUDE.md, improve it.\
<!-- -->- If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include them.\
<!-- -->- Be sure to prefix the file with the following text:
<!-- -->
<!-- --># CLAUDE.md
<!-- -->
<!-- -->This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The prompt launches a <code>BatchTool</code> agent with a few more tool calls to collect more files — based on that context prompt that hints it the directory tree:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>{

<!-- -->    ]
<!-- -->  }
<!-- -->}
</code></pre></pre>
<h2>Wrap up</h2>
<p>Overall, Claude Code tends to be more generic and secure for the price of extra time and money billed on more tokens.</p>
<p>This is very much unlike Cursor which would never attempt to analyze suggested bash tools. And I would have most often prefer that Claude Code's approach.</p>
<p>I've also noticed that it uses <code>claude-3-7-sonnet</code> for most things that require reasoning, and <code>claude-3-5-haiku</code> for simpler calls like parsing Bash commands. But still, <code>claude-3.5</code> can be quite an overkill for those and <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> would do that 10x cheaper ($1.5 vs $15 per 1M output tokens).</p>
<p>Still, in terms of UX, Claude Code is the winner for an agentic tool that runs in console. <a href="https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider" target="_blank">Aider</a> is close, but not nearly there in terms of reliability and UX. While Claude Code is a single NPM package (still requires a modern-ish version of Node which likely requires NVM installed), Aider's installation process self-installed <code>uv</code> on my machine just because it needed it. And <a href="https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands" target="_blank">OpenHands</a> had to download ~10Gb of Docker images.</p></div></div>]]></description>

I thought I would share my experience of maintaining an Android app.

If you use an open-source library, you have to be prepared for the fact that it may not be maintained.
I am just pointing out, how some of the obvious boilerplate tasks that one requires for building an Android app
are suddenly in a limbo.</p><h2 id="two-different-versioning-schemes-for-everything">Two different versioning schemes for everything</h2><p>Android has two

Android API version is for developers and Android version for marketing.</p><p>For example, Android 11 is API 30, Android 12 is API 31 as well as 32(!), Android 13 is API 33, Android 14 is API 34.
The developer documents would reference one scheme or the other or sometimes both!
And you are supposed to memorize the mappings while trying to debug issues using GitHub issues or StackOverflow.
It just adds unnecessary friction and confusion.</p><h2 id="forced-upgrades">Forced upgrades</h2><p>There are multiple versions in an Android app, all tightly coupled with each other.</p><ul><li><code>minSdkVersion</code> and <code>targetSdkVersion</code> of the app</li><li>Java <code>sourceCompatibility</code> and <code>targetCompatibility</code></li><li>version of dependencies</li><li>version of Android build tool chain</li><li>version of Gradle</li><li>version of Android Studio</li></ul><p>You might think that all updates are optional, but they aren’t</p><ul><li>Gradle and Android Studio must be upgraded together for

So, if you are planning to build an Android app as a hobby, keep the ongoing maintenance cost in mind.</p></div></div>]]></description>
