	<span><span><span>WASHINGTON, D.C, (May 2, 2025) — Patricia Harrison, President and CEO of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), issued the following statement today regarding the President’s Executive Order on public media:</span></span></span></p>

The discussion is around the plan your team had set in motion last quarter, and the results are being reviewed. Data is being twisted and harassed to confess to whatever version of reality the group wants to see. You are sitting there, and you see through the charade.</p><p>You’re wondering what the point of this is? You did not slog through life, battling inhuman entrance examinations, irrational parental expectations and eight rounds of interviews to get this coveted job, only to do this data jugglery. You’re wondering - why is nobody asking the fundamental, first principles questions? Why are we not questioning our premise? Why are we misinterpreting cause and effect? Why are we chasing these vanity metrics, when the metrics themselves are poor indicators of reality? Why have we accepted as gospel truth some ‘self-evident’ principles?</p><p>The meeting is adjourned, congratulatory messages are passed around, and a vague way forward is discussed. You shake your head, sigh deeply and groan internally, grab coffee and head to the next meeting.</p><p><span>You, my friend, are going through </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-022-03788-7" rel="">Epistemic Anxiety</a><span>.</span></p><div><p>Anxiety is an emotional response to risk. When we experience anxiety about an event, we perceive the risk to be real and possible, likely to occur in the near term.</p><p>Epistemic Anxiety is the feeling of uneasiness, tension, and concern when you want to know the truth. You worry that your knowledge is incomplete and full of errors, and you may believe it.</p><p>You either lack the resources, methods or agency to get to the truth.</p></div><p>The reason why Epistemic anxiety bothers you so much is because it is at odds with a universal human feeling: An innate desire for truth.</p><blockquote><p>In a world of information overload, our epistemic anxiety is off the charts. We are constantly bombarded with so much information and misinformation, that our brains are losing the ability to sift through it.</p><p>We are no longer able to parse the information we see, and thus, we default to our biases. We are aware of this, and that is why we want to live a life in which we can reduce this anxiety.</p></blockquote><p>But the way to the ‘truth’ is a journey filled with complications, rife with uncertainty and overflowing with pitfalls.</p><p>If we were to embark on an intellectual journey that would lead us to this ‘truth’ and allow us to reduce epistemic anxiety, we would need to immerse ourselves in the world of ideas, those that are novel and beyond our current comprehension.</p><p>But before we get onto this journey, we need to take another one. Back in time to the year 1970, at the University of Cambridge.</p><p><strong>The Game of Life</strong></p><p>John Conway was an English mathematician, who resembled a young Jack Nicholson from the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. Apart from making contributions to the theory of finite groups, number theory, and combinatorial game theory, he was also known for growing a branch of mathematics called recreational mathematics. </p><p>Simply put, math done for entertainment (gasp!)</p><p>In 1970, he invented a game called Conway’s Game of Life, which you and I are going to play. Don’t worry, it’s merely recreational mathematics. </p><p>The fun begins with the fact that it is a zero-player game.</p><p>Eh, what? What kind of game has no players?</p><p>It’s a game where the starting point defines the outcome. And it is governed by rules.</p><p>Do you remember the first time you got your hands on a computer, probably in the school computer lab, where for some inexplicable reason, one had to take off shoes to enter?</p><p>One of the games you may have played was Minesweeper. A large grid with mines hidden in each cell, and you had to click in such a way that you did not trigger any mines.</p><p>Imagine a similar kind of grid. And instead of clicking, you define the starting point, saying how many of these cells are filled.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14687714-46e2-4143-bf70-037ea6ea036b_1920x972.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14687714-46e2-4143-bf70-037ea6ea036b_1920x972.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14687714-46e2-4143-bf70-037ea6ea036b_1920x972.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14687714-46e2-4143-bf70-037ea6ea036b_1920x972.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14687714-46e2-4143-bf70-037ea6ea036b_1920x972.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14687714-46e2-4143-bf70-037ea6ea036b_1920x972.png" width="1456" height="737" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/14687714-46e2-4143-bf70-037ea6ea036b_1920x972.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:737,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;undefined&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="undefined" title="undefined" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14687714-46e2-4143-bf70-037ea6ea036b_1920x972.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14687714-46e2-4143-bf70-037ea6ea036b_1920x972.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14687714-46e2-4143-bf70-037ea6ea036b_1920x972.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14687714-46e2-4143-bf70-037ea6ea036b_1920x972.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Consider this as a random starting point</figcaption></figure></div><p>You can have as many or as few cells as you’d like.

Located in a parallel universe and your reality at the same time, you drop anchor on its shore. Only to discover that this ain’t the most hospitable of towns. The locals are not necessarily welcoming, and they look tired. Their faces look ashen, their eyes red with resignation, and their shoulders droop. They spend their nights in town, but during the day, they are nowhere to be found.</p><p><span>You, on the other hand, are looking to scale </span><em>Luminspire - The Mountains of Knowledge. </em><span>Legend has it that the most learned of women and men reside high into the mountains. Shrouded in mist, choosing to live silently, these people pursue their field of knowledge assiduously. They rarely ever venture into town, and even if they do, most people ignore them, just as they ignored you.</span></p><p><span>You can see these mountains from town, but everyone tells you that to get there, you will need to navigate </span><em>Moradoom - The Evergreen Forest of Late Stage Capitalism. </em><span>That is where they spend their days.</span></p><p><strong>Navigating Moradoom - The Evergreen Forest of Late Stage Capitalism</strong></p><p>Moradoom was once a deciduous woodland forest. About 50 years ago, it was recolonised with a different species of trees - evergreen pine, spruce, fir and oak. In their original form, they used to be truly deciduous - changing with the seasons. Trees, shrubs and herbaceous perennials would lose all their leaves for a part of the year. This fall of leaves was governed by a combination of daylight and air temperatures. Many deciduous plants flowered during the period when they were leafless, as it increased the effectiveness of pollination. The absence of leaves improved wind transmission of pollen for wind-pollinated plants, and increased the visibility of the flowers to insects in insect-pollinated plants.</p><p>Unfortunately, the evergreen trees which colonised Moradoom had mixed effects. There emerged two types of trees </p><p><strong>Nurturing Deciduous Trees:</strong><span> The kind which provide fruit on alternate years, shade all around the year and firewood towards the end of their lives. They are </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_shyness" rel="">canopy shy</a><span>, grow slowly, and left to themselves, would live long healthy lives, providing for both man and animal.</span></p><p><strong>Swallowing Evergreen Trees:</strong><span> These trees grow to gigantic sizes, far surpassing the North American Redwoods. They provide fruit all the time, but seldom provide shade. They grow quickly, are a perennial source of firewood, and grow so closely together that their canopies merge into each other. Thus, they block sunlight so effectively, that the entire forest is engulfed in darkness. They intensify the competition for sunlight, water and nutrients, thereby depriving nurturing trees of the resources they need. They accelerate the spread of disease, thereby leading to the demise of smaller ground-loving vegetation such as shrubs and grasses.</span></p><p>And they swallow entire human lives - physically and emotionally.</p><div><p>The nature of our work feels like navigating Moradoom. The swallowing trees are so high that we cannot climb them, and thus we cannot get sunlight. They are so densely packed together that trying to squeeze past them only means falling, hurting and bruising ourselves.</p><p>In the process of feeding these trees, we sacrifice our mind and body. They are relentless in their asks - They always want more, and each time we give more, we are marked as someone from whom more can be extracted.</p><p>The cost of their evergreen fruit is paid through the ever increasingly exploitation of our leisure time. We nurture these trees with tears of our dead dreams and the graves of our relationships.</p><p>And the only fruit you get is the one that falls on the ground, a consolation disguised as reward.</p></div><p>Getting stuck in Moradoom is easy. In all likelihood, if you’ve read this far, you and I are both stuck in it. It often takes us decades to emerge out of it, but by then we have lost our best years chasing the consolatory fruit. Each day we spend time in Moradoom, and return to our homes at night. What should be a refuge from the tyranny of the forest becomes the cage. We pay increasingly higher emotional and monetary costs to maintain these cages - our rents are always going up, the EMIs never seem to end and there is always something to fix in the house. Whatever is left, we burn it in the meaningless cycle of upgrading - Things we buy to impress people who don’t care about us. Or worse, to impress yourself.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

the Hamta village in Himachal Pradesh. I rented a one-room cottage, and my caretakers were Dolma Aunty and Kalzang Uncle, a couple well into their 70’s. And while a handful of tourists like me came and went, their constant companion was their mountain dog Rambo, who unfortunately lost his eyesight to snow-blindness. Uncle and Aunty used to cook for me, and they also became my companions.</p><p><span>Dolma Aunty and I settled into a routine. I would walk up to the dhaba, making my way through a </span><em>pagdandi </em><span>(loose path) which was nestled amongst apple and apricot trees. It was the rainy season, and the entire mountain was lush green, with wildflowers accentuating the beauty of the mountains. The white wildflowers were a particular favourite - I’d love to gaze at them and the good old Rambo would love to smell and rub his nose in them.</span></p><p><span>My mornings started with a sweet pahadi chai with Aunty, as we sat leisurely outside the dhaba, doing something which only the pahadis know best - </span><em>Dhoop Sekana</em><span>. A practice which we are losing with urban living. I find it difficult to translate what Dhoop Sekana means - But imagine yourself sitting on a </span><em>chatai</em><span> or a chair in cold weather, in a verandah or on a terrace. It’s early morning and the sun has come up, gently beginning to warm your body. You’re enveloped by silence all around you, occasionally punctuated by the sounds of birds calling out to each other. A sense of coziness starts building. Time passes leisurely, and you sit without a care in the world.</span></p><p>As I sipped my tea, I often got into conversations with Aunty. She was curious about my life - of moving away from home for an education and a job, and how I was able to constantly switch cities every few years. Of how home was never a place, but the people who mattered in my life. I, in turn, was amazed by how they seemed to live completely off their land and were happy with so little.</p><p>And when I said this to her, she gave me a puzzled look and she said “What makes you think I have so little? I have everything that I need”</p><p>I was surprised, and I said - I am sure that you could do with a few more things, a few more comforts that would make your life easier. It would make you happier too.</p><p><em>And in the most normal way she said - Main santusht hoon (I am satisfied).</em></p><blockquote><p>The one month of simple living in the Himalayas taught me the importance of satisfaction. I lived in a one-room cottage, with a single mattress, a chair and a bookshelf. One single bulb illuminated the room, and power cuts were the norm.</p><p>Despite being used to the comforts of urban living, all it took me was a few days to settle into a routine. Outside the first few days, being hard with this drastic change, I was able to find contentment in the slow pace of living.</p><p>And just as easily, once I returned to my regular life, I slipped back into my old patterns, unable to break out of my unhealthy habits, and yet somewhere Dolma Aunty’s voice stayed in my head.</p></blockquote><p><span>We need the Axe of Satisfaction to cut through the Swallowing Evergreen Trees. Their evergreen desire to exploit us is only rivalled by our evergreen desire to give in. The Netflix documentary </span><a href="https://www.netflix.com/in/title/81554996" rel="">Buy Now! The Shopping Conspiracy</a><span> tells us that this behaviour is deeply damaging to the world we live in.</span></p><p><span>Because the moment we find a sense of satisfaction, our need to elevate our status through overconsumption of objects and experiences will diminish. We will no longer have </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_Anxiety" rel="">status anxiety</a><span> and we will worry far less about how the world perceives us.</span></p><p>But even if we cut through Moradoom and emerge with a clear understanding of what satisfies us, we are going to run into another challenge.</p><p><strong>Arriving at Igamor - The Disorienting Caves of Ignorance</strong></p><p>Take a moment and reflect on your life. Think about where you grew up, who your early influences were, the schools and universities you went to, and the jobs you did. Remember the people who crossed paths with you, some stayed on, but most moved away.</p><p>If you had the typical Millennial experience that I did, you have lived through a time of one of the most rapid changes in human history. We leapt from the industrial age to the information age to ‘whatever this mess we live in’ is called. As humans, we became such a force of planetary change, that scientists are debating if we should coin it as an entirely new geological epoch called the Anthropocene.</p><p><span>The rapid change also brought in societal upheaval around the key pillars which define modern societies: Gender, Race and Religion. Closer home, we are living in a country, where as young women become more liberal, young men are turning more conservative, and even within this, </span><a href="https://www.ggd.world/p/why-is-north-central-india-more-conservative" rel="">North-Central vs South India</a><span> differs. Men are increasingly finding it hard to understand and explain their position in the world and what masculinity means. Religion is a central tension point in Indian politics, and our class and caste struggles are nowhere near resolution. Even if you consider the urban elite of India (folks like you and me), who are insulated from the ‘Rest of India’, the economic anxiety is stifling. The Indian Millennial today is living under </span><a href="https://utsavmamoria.substack.com/p/why-are-we-so-tired-all-the-time" rel="">The Great Squeeze</a><span>. We have been pushed to achieve everything in a short period, and are hyper-focused towards our goals. Goals that are physically, emotionally and economically crushing us.</span></p><p>Amidst all this, we are supposed to reconcile what we know (things we learnt growing up) with the new information that presents in front of us.

Their fascination was pebbles, and not completely by accident, because their parents were archaeologists in Egypt. One of the girls was named Dorothy, and in 1928, she joined her parents at the archaeological site of Jerash, in present-day Jordan, where she documented the patterns of mosaics from multiple Byzantine-era Churches dated to the 5th–6th centuries.</p><p><span>She spent more than a year finishing the drawings as she started her studies in Oxford, while also conducting chemical analyses of glass tesserae from the same site. She had developed a keen interest in chemistry, so much so, that on her 16th birthday her mother gave her a book by W. H. Bragg on X-ray crystallography, "</span><em>Concerning the Nature of Things</em><span>"</span></p><p>This book proved pivotal to her eventual interests. In 1932, Dorothy Hodgkin began a PhD at Cambridge, and it was then that she became aware of the potential of X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of proteins. And her undying curiosity about the structure of things - from pebbles to proteins, found the catalyst that would soon shape the modern world - X-ray crystallography.</p><p><span>In the year 1945, Hodgkin and her colleagues, including biochemist Barbara Low, solved the structure of </span><strong>Penicillin</strong><span>, which went against all contemporary understanding of the antibiotic.</span></p><p><span>In 1948, Hodgkin first encountered one of the most structurally complex vitamins known to civilization. At the time, its structure was almost completely unknown, and when Hodgkin discovered it contained cobalt, she realized the structure actualization could be determined by X-ray crystallography analysis. The study published by Hodgkin was described as being as significant "as breaking the sound barrier". The vitamin is well known to the urban Indian elite, for so many of us are deficient in it - </span><strong>Vitamin B12.</strong></p><p>But the crowning glory of her life came after a struggle of three decades, which started back in 1934.</p><p>The British organic chemist Robert Robinson offered a small sample of a crystalline hormone to Dorothy. The hormone captured her imagination because of the intricate and wide-ranging effect it has in the body. However, at this stage X-ray crystallography had not been developed far enough to cope with the complexity of the molecule. She and others spent many years improving the technique.</p><p>It took 35 years after taking her first photograph of the crystal for X-ray crystallography and computing techniques to be able to tackle larger and more complex molecules. Hodgkin's dream of unlocking the structure of that hormone was put on hold until 1969 when she was finally able to work with her team of young, international scientists to uncover the structure for the first time. The hormone we all know too well today.</p><p><strong>Insulin</strong></p><p>Hodgkin's work with insulin was instrumental in paving the way for insulin to be mass-produced and used on a large scale for treatment of both Type I and Type II diabetes.</p><p>Dorothy Hodgkin went from studying pebbles in streams to uncovering and understanding the nature of penicillin, vitamin B12 and insulin.</p><p><span>Work which has easily saved the life of a billion people</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-157793391" href="https://utsavmamoria.substack.com/p/how-to-live-an-intellectually-rich#footnote-2-157793391" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span>. </span></p><p>All driven by wielding the Torch of Curiosity.</p><p>Hodgkin solved her and our ignorance by constantly applying the torch of curiosity. And I’d happily assume if you’ve clicked on this piece and are still reading, you are a curious person.</p><p>So let us for a moment assume that you have not only cut through Moradoom - The evergreen forest of late stage capitalism, but have also escaped Igamor - The disorienting caves of ignorance.</p><p>But my friend, you are now caught right in the middle of Evermore.</p><p><strong>Navigating Evermore - The River of Responsibilities</strong></p><p>In 2013, Yitang Zhang, a former accountant who worked at a Subway franchise, called his wife “Pay attention to the media and newspapers”, he said. “You may see my name”</p><p>and she said</p><p>“Are you drunk?”</p><p>You should not blame Zhang’s wife. Every other man who walks this earth thinks his thoughts and ideas are stuff of genius. I don’t have data for this, but I have a strong feeling that many women would agree.</p><p>Zhang met his wife at a Chinese restaurant in Long Island, New York, where she was a waitress. He was born in Shanghai in 1955. His mother was a secretary in a government office, and his father was a college professor whose field was electrical engineering. As a small boy, he began “trying to know everything in mathematics,” he said. “I became very thirsty for math.”</p><p>His parents moved to Beijing for work, and Zhang remained in Shanghai with his grandmother. Mao’s Cultural Revolution had closed the schools. He spent most of his time reading math books that he ordered from a bookstore for less than a dollar.</p><p>Eventually, Zhang moved to Beijing to study at Peking University, China’s most respected school, and subsequently moved to Purdue University for his PhD. He earned his doctorate in 1991 and then disappeared from the mathematics scene.</p><p>He lived, sometimes with friends, in Lexington, Kentucky, where he had occasional work at a motel, and in New York City, where he also had friends and occasional work. Zhang found a job keeping the books at a Subway franchise. When Zhang wasn’t working, he would go to the library at the University of Kentucky and read journals in algebraic geometry and number theory. “For years, I didn’t really keep up my dream in mathematics,” he said.</p><p>In 1999, through the help of a friend, he secured a teaching position at the University of New Hampshire. He was still a nobody in the world of mathematics. </p><p>He rented an apartment about four miles from campus and rode to and from his office with students on a school shuttle. He said that he likes to sit on the bus and think. </p><p><span>Seven days a week, he arrived at his office around eight or nine and stayed until six or seven. The longest he had taken off from thinking was two weeks. Sometimes he woke up in the morning thinking of a math problem he had been considering when he fell asleep. Outside his office is a long corridor that he liked to walk up and down. Otherwise, he walked outside.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-157793391" href="https://utsavmamoria.substack.com/p/how-to-live-an-intellectually-rich#footnote-3-157793391" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p>The man took his routine more seriously than most of us do. </p><p>And you’d ask, what is so remarkable about that?</p><p>It’s remarkable because the call to his wife was not a drunk phone call. He was serious.</p><p><span>On April 17, 2013, without telling anyone, he sent a paper to </span><em>Annals of Mathematics</em><span>, widely regarded as the profession’s most prestigious journal. When the reviewers completed their review of it, they came back with the following comments</span></p><p><em>“We have completed our study of the paper ‘Bounded Gaps Between Primes’ by Yitang Zhang.” They went on, “The main results are of the first rank. The author has succeeded in proving a landmark theorem in the distribution of prime numbers.” And, “Although we studied the arguments very thoroughly, we found it very difficult to spot even the smallest slip. . . . We are very happy to strongly recommend acceptance of the paper for publication in the Annals.” </em><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-157793391" href="https://utsavmamoria.substack.com/p/how-to-live-an-intellectually-rich#footnote-4-157793391" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span></p><p>His paper was a back-door attack on the Twin Prime Conjecture, one of the greatest open problems in mathematics. It asserts that there are an infinite number of prime numbers that are only two numbers apart (Think 5 and 7, 11 and 13, the difference is always 2). Such pairs are more frequent at the beginning of the number line and less so among large numbers.</p><p>Zhang’s result did not prove that there are an infinite number of twin primes; rather, it gives a finite upper bound––70 million––for which the gaps between pairs of primes persist infinitely often.</p><p>Big deal, you’d say. The gap between 2 (the conjecture) and 70 million (what Zhang proved) is a factor of 35 million. But what we fail to account for is that the result is infinitely better than the gap between 2 and infinity. The people who had come closest to proving the twin-prime conjecture, had this to say</p><blockquote><p>“What Zhang did was sensational. His work is a masterpiece. When you talk of number theory, a lot of the beauty is the machinery. Zhang somehow completely understood the situation, even though he was working alone. That’s how he surprised us.”</p><p>“Written with crystalline clarity and a total command of the topic’s current state of the art, he has proved one of the great results in the history of number theory.”</p><p>“He’s not a known expert, but he succeeded where all the experts had failed.”</p></blockquote><p>Zhang is a classic example of the power of routine. Even in mathematical obscurity, he consistently went to the library and kept abreast of the developments in algebraic geometry and number theory. He worked every day - the same hours, at the same place, with little to no change in his routine. Zhang had finished “Bounded Gaps Between Primes” in late 2012; and then he spent a few months methodically checking each step, which he said was “very boring.”</p><blockquote><p>Zhang’s work was never about the hustle culture which envelopes and consumes us, just like the swallowing trees of Moradoom do. His routine is a beautiful poem, pithy with a clear message - Consistency over Flashes of Brilliance. Repeatability over Spontaneous Genius.</p></blockquote><p>In our lives, we are all wading through Evermore - The River of Responsibilities.

When your child needs attention in a meaningful way, you need to be present. When that presentation deadline is looming, you need to hunker down and get the work done.

And ahead of you lies an entire mountain range. As far as the eye can see, you can see peaks one after the other. You look around and realise you are on a peak yourself. How did you get here?</p><p>By doing what you have been doing for years. Each of us, by accident or by choice, has picked out a career or an area to work in. Working with a multitude of people, clients and partners in that area, you have developed an expertise in it. So much so, that it comes naturally to you, and you sometimes forget to consider it as a valued skill. You use it effortlessly at work and advise younger folks who are trying to grow their knowledge in the space. Your skill drives considerable impact, and you are rightfully an expert in that space. </p><p>And as you stand on the peak, you can make out that other experts are standing on other peaks. Peaks you know something about, peaks you have just heard of and peaks you did not even know existed. You try and shout to communicate with them, but they cannot hear you. Your voice merely echoes, ricocheting off the surface of the mountain. You’d like to get onto another peak, speak to the expert sitting on it. You want to engage them in conversation and learn from them, but it would require you to do something hard. </p><p>Get off your peak.</p><p>Because getting off your peak would mean going through the discomfort of abandoning all notions of knowledge, and being willing to become a student again. You will need to accept that you know nothing about this new peak.</p><p>Thomas Szasz, a Hungarian-American psychiatrist, once remarked</p><div><p>Every act of conscious learning requires the willingness to suffer an injury to one's self-esteem. </p><p>That is why young children, before they are aware of their own self-importance, learn so easily; and why older persons, especially if vain or important, cannot learn at all.</p></div><p>We all need to come down from our peaks. For us to truly learn something, we need to abandon our views about it. Because the act of coming down from the peak forces us to do three things</p><ol><li><p><strong>Understand the limits of our thinking:</strong><span> As we come down, and shed our views, we start seeing our field of knowledge more objectively, and understand that there are limits to our thinking, even though we are experts.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Open space for contemplation:</strong><span> Once we come down, and make our way to another peak, we start walking, which opens the space for contemplation.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Isolate ourselves from our ego:</strong><span> Once we have stripped ourselves of our views, and contemplated, we isolate ourselves from our Ego.

Not Avogadro’s number or the value of gravity at the surface of the earth.</p><p>Sample this.</p><p>An Erdős number describes a person's degree of separation from Erdős himself, based on their collaboration with him, or with another who has their own Erdős number. Erdős alone was assigned the Erdős number of 0 (for being himself), while his immediate collaborators could claim an Erdős number of 1, their collaborators have Erdős number at most 2, and so on.</p><p>Approximately 200,000 mathematicians have an assigned Erdős number, and some have estimated that 90 percent of the world's active mathematicians have an Erdős number smaller than 8.</p><p>Imagine, for a second, that 90% of the people in your field are connected with you via collaborators.</p><p>He worked with more than 500 collaborators. He firmly believed mathematics to be a social activity, living an itinerant lifestyle with the sole purpose of writing mathematical papers with other mathematicians. He devoted his waking hours to mathematics, even into his later years; he died at a mathematics conference in Warsaw in 1996.</p><p><em>Time</em><span> magazine called him "The Oddball's Oddball".</span></p><p>Possessions meant little to Erdős; most of his belongings would fit in a suitcase. Awards and other earnings were generally donated to people in need and various worthy causes. He spent most of his life traveling between scientific conferences, universities, and the homes of colleagues worldwide. He earned enough stipends to fund his travels and basic needs as a guest lecturer at universities and from various mathematical awards.</p><p>He would typically show up at a colleague's doorstep and announce "my brain is open", staying long enough to collaborate on a few papers before moving on a few days later. In many cases, he would ask the current collaborator about whom to visit next.</p><p>After his mother died in 1971, he started taking antidepressants and amphetamines. His friend, the American mathematician, Ron Graham bet him $500 that he could not stop taking them for a month.</p><p>Erdős won the bet but complained that it impacted his performance: "You've showed me I'm not an addict. But I didn't get any work done. I'd get up in the morning and stare at a blank piece of paper. I'd have no ideas, just like an ordinary person. You've set mathematics back a month."</p><p>After he won the bet, he promptly resumed his use of antidepressants and amphetamines.</p><p><span>Overall, his work leaned towards solving previously open problems, rather than developing or exploring new areas of mathematics. Erdős published around 1,500 mathematical papers during his lifetime, a figure that remains unsurpassed.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-157793391" href="https://utsavmamoria.substack.com/p/how-to-live-an-intellectually-rich#footnote-5-157793391" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span></p><blockquote><p>Erdős was so prolific because he collaborated. He was aware of the limits of his knowledge, and actively sought collaborators to move mathematics ahead. He was willing to let go of his ego and enmesh himself with other experts. </p><p>He was willing to get down from his peak, walk, and climb the next peak. And do it all over again. Over an entire lifetime.</p></blockquote><p>So in a life, where meeting new people and making new friends is hard in your 30’s and 40’s, how could you possibly find experts and collaborators? When each of us is enmeshed in our fields and sub-fields, how are we to isolate and enmesh ourselves with others?</p><p><strong>Building and Finding Communities</strong></p><p><span>On 8th April 2024, </span><a href="https://thingsofinternet.substack.com/" rel="">Deepak ‘Chuck’ Gopalakrishnan</a><span> and I started a little experiment. We launched </span><a href="https://www.thesixpercent.club/" rel="">The 6% Club</a><span>, where we hoped to help people launch their newsletters, podcasts or YouTube channels. We expected 10 people to sign up.</span></p><p>80 did.</p><p>We had to limit the size of the cohort to 40, and open another cohort in July, which had to accommodate the other 40. And while we were thrilled to have such an overwhelming response, we did not even anticipate the hidden benefits we would accrue.</p><p>How often do you meet smart, thoughtful, empathetic and creative people? </p><p>How often do you meet them, 40 at a time?</p><p>How often do you meet a fresh set of 40, four times a year?</p><p>Over the past year, across four cohorts, we have had the privilege to intimately know 150+ such people. I am floored by the dumb luck we are experiencing - Just as a sample: We have mentored wildlife photographers, physicians, scientists, painters, professors and ultramarathoners. Even someone who has an Erdős number of 2. We have mentored people who have gone through life-changing trauma, and have subsequently turned their life around (which btw is deeply embarrassing because what can I teach them?). We have had the privilege of seeing thoughtful newsletters, vulnerable podcasts and beautiful YouTube channels come to life. And we can claim a tiny piece of credit for them.</p><p><span>Everyday, I get the opportunity to climb down from my peak, and ask these folks elementary questions, and have them indulge me with an equanimity only surpassed by the experts facing </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWS-qfR6K3w" rel="">Philomena Cunk</a><span>.</span></p><p>Everyday, I get the privilege of having these people being one message or call away. I could even call some of them, friends.</p><p>You may not be at a point in life to be able to build such a community. But you can find experts and collaborators. Here is how you could do it</p><ol><li><p>Define 1-2 areas you’d want to learn about. Something you have been genuinely curious about, ideally for a long time.</p></li><li><p>Ask EVERYONE you know - Hey, I am interested in learning about Y. Do you know someone who knows a lot about Y?</p></li><li><p>Once you find a connection, ask for a warm introduction. I can almost guarantee you, the expert will be happy to give you their time.</p></li><li><p>Ask thoughtful questions. Don’t expect them to explain things to you, but ask them to point you to resources, or craft a learning path with them.</p></li><li><p>Put in the hours, immerse yourself in the resources and update them about the progress you have made and the things you have learnt.</p></li><li><p>This in turn will start a conversation. </p></li><li><p>Repeat 1 - 6 for the rest of your life.</p></li></ol><p>And what will happen?</p><p>You have kickstarted your own version of ‘The Game of Life’. Remember, the Game of Life has only one variable: The starting point. You now have not just ideas from your field, but ideas from fields you know nothing about. You will now see ‘emergence’ in action.</p><p><span>I’ve experienced this first hand. Take this Substack for example. My initial pieces were in the style I typically wrote in - Text, with a few images. Then, through one of the cohort members of The 6% Club, I was introduced to the writings of </span><a href="https://moretothat.com/" rel="">More to That</a><span>. A few years earlier, thanks to an early conversation with </span><a href="https://sneakyart.substack.com/" rel="">Nishant Jain (aka SneakyArtist)</a><span>, who encouraged me to sketch, I got over my fears and picked up sketching with a pen. How did I discover him? By listening to him on Amit Varma’s </span><a href="https://seenunseen.in/episodes/2022/1/17/episode-260-sneaky-artist-sees-the-world/" rel="">The Seen and The Unseen</a><span>. I just reached out to him, and got a conversation going. I showed him my early sketches and he gave me feedback. I sought another expert in </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/inkvistas/reels/" rel="">Khushboo Prashant</a><span> whose course taught me the basics of linework. With her kindness and patience, she gave me extensive feedback on my sketching (and all of them gave me faith in the generosity of experts).</span></p><p><span>Combined with my existential questions, pieces like these (and the last three, </span><a href="https://utsavmamoria.substack.com/p/why-are-we-missing-awe-in-our-life?r=6eyyp" rel="">here</a><span>, </span><a href="https://utsavmamoria.substack.com/p/why-we-understand-time-wrong?r=6eyyp" rel="">here</a><span> and </span><a href="https://utsavmamoria.substack.com/p/why-are-we-so-tired-all-the-time?r=6eyyp" rel="">here</a><span>) were born. I take inspiration (which includes me trying to copy their style and fail) from multiple artists for the linework and sketches you see in the pieces. Now with this one, I tried my hand at drawing a fantasy map, coming up with names for all the places (which I could not, and my fantasy fiction loving partner did). I have used watercolours extensively to bring the map alive, and I will let you decide how good/bad/ugly it is.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-157793391" href="https://utsavmamoria.substack.com/p/how-to-live-an-intellectually-rich#footnote-6-157793391" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span></p><p>Could I have elevated my writing without all these experts? Not a chance in hell. They may not be my collaborators today, but who knows what the future holds?</p><p>The unknowability of a future filled with the potential of giving birth to new ideas and projects is what makes life worth living.</p><p>So there you have it - The key to living an intellectually rich life. But there is one step missing.</p><p><strong>Document your intellectual journey</strong></p><p>Write physically in a journal, write on your phone, write on your laptop. Write on whatever latest gadget you’ve gotten your hands on.</p><p>Write notes, single line ideas, thoughts, quotes. Doodle, sketch, paint. Write entire pieces in long form, by hand.</p><p>Write for no one but yourself. The act of writing forces you to think clearly. It makes you commit your ideas to paper in a logical flow. It allows you to make connections you did not see earlier. It allows you to come up with ideas that seemed implausible. Writing is emergence, of the ideas and the self.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ac88c8e-98ed-42f6-a8ff-19ae0468cde1_3365x2588.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ac88c8e-98ed-42f6-a8ff-19ae0468cde1_3365x2588.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ac88c8e-98ed-42f6-a8ff-19ae0468cde1_3365x2588.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ac88c8e-98ed-42f6-a8ff-19ae0468cde1_3365x2588.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ac88c8e-98ed-42f6-a8ff-19ae0468cde1_3365x2588.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ac88c8e-98ed-42f6-a8ff-19ae0468cde1_3365x2588.jpeg" width="3365" height="2588" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5ac88c8e-98ed-42f6-a8ff-19ae0468cde1_3365x2588.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2588,&quot;width&quot;:3365,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1331059,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://utsavmamoria.substack.com/i/157793391?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f77a659-e0ab-46d6-8507-ce854b474a98_3436x2658.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ac88c8e-98ed-42f6-a8ff-19ae0468cde1_3365x2588.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ac88c8e-98ed-42f6-a8ff-19ae0468cde1_3365x2588.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ac88c8e-98ed-42f6-a8ff-19ae0468cde1_3365x2588.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ac88c8e-98ed-42f6-a8ff-19ae0468cde1_3365x2588.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Early notes from my journal for developing this piece.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                        <p>LONDON (AP) — European Union privacy watchdogs fined TikTok 530 million euros ($600 million) on Friday after a <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-europe-data-privacy-ireland-a01b6717a95ce2d36021bda80994f151">four-year investigation</a></span> found that the video sharing app’s data transfers to China breached strict data privacy rules in the EU. </p><p>Ireland’s Data Protection Commission also sanctioned TikTok for not being transparent with users about where their personal data was being sent and it ordered the company to comply with the rules within six months. </p><p>The Irish national watchdog serves as TikTok’s lead data privacy regulator in the 27-nation EU because the company’s European headquarters is based in Dublin. </p><p>“TikTok failed to verify, guarantee and demonstrate that the personal data of (European) users, remotely accessed by staff in China, was afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the EU,” Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said in a statement. </p>
    
<p>TikTok said it disagreed with the decision and plans to appeal. </p><p>The company said in a blog post that the decision focuses on a “select period” ending in May 2023, before it embarked on a data localization project called Project Clover that involved building <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-data-privacy-china-europe-4d0dd2f7eb39bfdcbb5e7a85cc26e8da">three data centers</a></span> in Europe. </p>



<p>“The facts are that Project Clover has some of the most stringent data protections anywhere in the industry, including unprecedented independent oversight by NCC Group, a leading European cybersecurity firm,” said Christine Grahn, TikTok’s European head of public policy and government relations. “The decision fails to fully consider these considerable data security measures.”</p>
    
    
    
<p>TikTok, whose parent company ByteDance is based in China, has been under scrutiny in Europe over how it handles personal information of its users amid concerns from Western officials that it poses a security risk over user data sent to China. In 2023, the Irish watchdog also fined the company hundreds of millions of euros in a separate <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-data-privacy-europe-regulation-fine-8ebacba7646ef872fb8e85a1bcb93876">child privacy investigation</a></span>. </p>
    
<p>The Irish watchdog said its investigation found that TikTok failed to address “potential access by Chinese authorities” to European users’ personal data under Chinese laws on anti-terrorism, counter-espionage, cybersecurity and national intelligence that were identified as “materially diverging” from EU standards.</p><p>Grahn said TikTok has “has never received a request for European user data from the Chinese authorities, and has never provided European user data to them.” </p><p>Under the EU rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, European user data can only be transferred outside of the bloc if there are safeguards in place to ensure the same level of protection. </p><p>Grahn said TikTok strongly disagreed with the Irish regulator’s argument that it didn’t carry out “necessary assessments” for data transfers, saying it sought advice from law firms and experts. She said TikTok was being “singled out” even though it uses the “same legal mechanisms” that thousands of other companies in Europe does and its approach is “in line” with EU rules. </p><p>The investigation, which opened in September 2021, also found that TikTok’s privacy policy at the time did not name third countries, including China, where user data was transferred. The watchdog said the policy, which has since been updated, failed to explain that data processing involved “remote access to personal data stored in Singapore and the United States by personnel based in China.”</p>
    
<p>TikTok faces further scrutiny from the Irish regulator, which said that the company had provided inaccurate information to throughout the inquiry by saying that it didn’t store European user data on Chinese servers. It wasn’t until April that it informed the regulator that it discovered in February that some data had in fact been stored on Chinese servers. </p><p>Doyle said that the watchdog is taking the recent developments “very seriously” and “considering what further regulatory action may be warranted.” </p>

							<p>Apps are changing the world, enriching people’s lives, and enabling developers like you to innovate like never before. As a result, the App&nbsp;Store has grown into an exciting and vibrant ecosystem for millions of developers and more than a billion users. Whether you are a first-time developer or a large team of experienced programmers, we are excited that you are creating apps for our platforms, and want to help you understand our guidelines so you can be confident your app will get through the review process quickly.</p>

						</div>
					<div id="content-container">

						<h3 data-sidenav="" id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
						<p>The guiding principle of the App&nbsp;Store is simple—we want to provide a safe experience for users to get apps and a great opportunity for all developers to be successful. We do this by offering a highly curated App&nbsp;Store where every app is reviewed by experts and an editorial team helps users discover new apps every day. We also scan each app for malware and other software that may impact user safety, security, and privacy. These efforts have made Apple’s platforms the safest for consumers around the world.</p>

						<p>In the European Union, developers can also distribute notarized iOS and iPadOS apps from alternative app marketplaces and directly from their website. Learn more about <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/distributing-apps-in-the-european-union/manage-distribution-on-an-alternative-app-marketplace">alternative app marketplaces</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/web-distribution-eu/">Web Distribution<span></span></a>, and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#notarization-for-ios-apps">Notarization for iOS and iPadOS apps<span></span></a>. You can see which guidelines apply to Notarization for iOS and iPadOS apps by clicking on “Show Notarization Review Guidelines Only” in the menu to the left.</p>

						<p>For everything else there is always the open Internet. If the App&nbsp;Store model and guidelines or alternative app marketplaces and Notarization for iOS and iPadOS apps are not best for your app or business idea that’s okay, we provide Safari for a great web experience too.</p>

						<p>On the following pages you will find our latest guidelines arranged into five clear sections: Safety, Performance, Business, Design, and Legal. The App&nbsp;Store is always changing and improving to keep up with the needs of our customers and our products. Your apps should change and improve as well in order to stay on the App&nbsp;Store.</p>
						<p>A few other points to keep in mind about distributing your app on our platforms:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>We have lots of kids downloading lots of apps. Parental controls work great to protect kids, but you have to do your part too. So know that we’re keeping an eye out for the kids.</li>
							<li>The App&nbsp;Store is a great way to reach hundreds of millions of people around the world. If you build an app that you just want to show to family and friends, the App&nbsp;Store isn’t the best way to do that. Consider using Xcode to install your app on a device for free or use Ad Hoc distribution available to Apple&nbsp;Developer Program members. If you’re just getting started, learn more about the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/">Apple&nbsp;Developer Program</a>.</li>
							<li>We strongly support all points of view being represented on the App&nbsp;Store, as long as the apps are respectful to users with differing opinions and the quality of the app experience is great. We will reject apps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, “I’ll know it when I see it”. And we think that you will also know it when you cross it.</li>
							<li>If you attempt to cheat the system (for example, by trying to trick the review process, steal user data, copy another developer’s work, manipulate ratings or App&nbsp;Store discovery) your apps will be removed from the store and you will be expelled from the Apple&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;Program.</li>
							<li>You are responsible for making sure everything in your app complies with these guidelines, including ad networks, analytics services, and third-party SDKs, so review and choose them carefully.</li>
							<li>Some features and technologies that are not generally available to developers may be offered as an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements">entitlement</a> for limited use cases. For example, we offer entitlements for CarPlay&nbsp;Audio, HyperVisor, and Privileged File Operations.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>We hope these guidelines help you sail through the review process, and that approvals and rejections remain consistent across the board. This is a living document; new apps presenting new questions may result in new rules at any time. Perhaps your app will trigger this. We love this stuff too, and honor what you do. We’re really trying our best to create the best platform in the world for you to express your talents and make a living, too.</p>

						<h3 data-sidenav="" id="before-you-submit">Before You Submit</h3>
						<p>To help your app approval go as smoothly as possible, review the common missteps listed below that can slow down the review process or trigger a rejection. This doesn’t replace the guidelines or guarantee approval, but making sure you can check every item on the list is a good start. If your app no longer functions as intended or you’re no longer actively supporting it, it will be removed from the App&nbsp;Store. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store-improvements/">Learn more about App&nbsp;Store Improvements</a>.</p>
						<p>Make sure you:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Test your app for crashes and bugs</li>
							<li>Ensure that all app information and metadata is complete and accurate</li>
							<li>Update your contact information in case App&nbsp;Review needs to reach you</li>
							<li>Provide App&nbsp;Review with full access to your app. If your app includes account-based features, provide either an active demo account or fully-featured demo mode, plus any other hardware or resources that might be needed to review your app (e.g. login credentials or a sample QR code)</li>
							<li>Enable backend services so that they’re live and accessible during review</li>
							<li>Include detailed explanations of non-obvious features and in-app purchases in the App&nbsp;Review notes, including supporting documentation where appropriate</li>
							<li>Check whether your app follows guidance in other documentation, such as:</li>
						</ul>

						
						<p data-nr="">Guidelines that include <img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"> apply to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#notarization-for-ios-apps">Notarization for iOS and iPadOS apps<span></span></a> in the EU.</p>

						<h3 data-nr="" data-sidenav="" id="safety"><span id="1"></span>1. Safety</h3>
						<p>When people install an app from the App&nbsp;Store, they want to feel confident that it’s safe to do so—that the app doesn’t contain upsetting or offensive content, won’t damage their device, and isn’t likely to cause physical harm from its use. We’ve outlined the major pitfalls below, but if you’re looking to shock and offend people, the App&nbsp;Store isn’t the right place for your app. Some of these rules are also included in Notarization for iOS and iPadOS apps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li data-sidenav="1.1 Objectionable Content" id="objectionable-content"><span id="1.1"></span><strong>1.1 Objectionable Content</strong>
								<p data-nr="">Apps should not include content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy. Examples of such content include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li id="1.1.1"><strong>1.1.1</strong> Defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content, including references or commentary about religion, race, sexual orientation, gender, national/ethnic origin, or other targeted groups, particularly if the app is likely to humiliate, intimidate, or harm a targeted individual or group. Professional political satirists and humorists are generally exempt from this requirement.</li>
									<li id="1.1.2"><strong>1.1.2</strong> Realistic portrayals of people or animals being killed, maimed, tortured, or abused, or content that encourages violence. “Enemies” within the context of a game cannot solely target a specific race, culture, real government, corporation, or any other real entity.</li>
									<li id="1.1.3"><strong>1.1.3</strong> Depictions that encourage illegal or reckless use of weapons and dangerous objects, or facilitate the purchase of firearms or ammunition.</li>
									<li id="1.1.4"><strong>1.1.4</strong> Overtly sexual or pornographic material, defined as “explicit descriptions or displays of sexual organs or activities intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings.” This includes “hookup” apps and other apps that may include pornography or be used to facilitate prostitution, or human trafficking and exploitation.</li>
									<li id="1.1.5"><strong>1.1.5</strong> Inflammatory religious commentary or inaccurate or misleading quotations of religious texts.</li>
									<li data-nr="" id="1.1.6"><strong>1.1.6</strong><span><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"></span> False information and features, including inaccurate device data or trick/joke functionality, such as fake location trackers. Stating that the app is “for entertainment purposes” won’t overcome this guideline. Apps that enable anonymous or prank phone calls or SMS/MMS messaging will be rejected.</li>
									<li id="1.1.7"><strong>1.1.7</strong> Harmful concepts which capitalize or seek to profit on recent or current events, such as violent conflicts, terrorist attacks, and epidemics.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li data-sidenav="1.2 User-Generated Content" id="user-generated-content"><span id="1.2"></span><strong>1.2 User-Generated Content</strong>
								<p>Apps with user-generated content present particular challenges, ranging from intellectual property infringement to anonymous bullying. To prevent abuse, apps with user-generated content or social networking services must include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>A method for filtering objectionable material from being posted to the app</li>
									<li>A mechanism to report offensive content and timely responses to concerns</li>
									<li>The ability to block abusive users from the service</li>
									<li>Published contact information so users can easily reach you</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Apps with user-generated content or services that end up being used primarily for pornographic content, Chatroulette-style experiences, objectification of real people (e.g. “hot-or-not” voting), making physical threats, or bullying do not belong on the App&nbsp;Store and may be removed without notice. If your app includes user-generated content from a web-based service, it may display incidental mature “NSFW” content, provided that the content is hidden by default and only displayed when the user turns it on via your website.</p>
								<ul>
									<li id="1.2.1"><strong>1.2.1 Creator Content</strong><br>Apps which feature content from a specific community of users called “creators” are a great opportunity if properly moderated. These apps present a singular, unified experience for customers to interact with various kinds of creator content. They offer tools and programs to help this community of non-developer creators to author, share, and monetize user-generated experiences. These experiences must not change the core features and functionality of the native app—rather, they add content to those structured experiences. These experiences are not native “apps” coded by developers—they are content within the app itself and are treated as user-generated content by App&nbsp;Review. Such creator content may include video, articles, audio, and even casual games. The App&nbsp;Store supports apps offering such user-generated content so long as they follow all Guidelines, including Guideline 1.2 for moderating user-generated content and Guideline 3.1.1 for payments and in-app purchases. Creator apps should share the age rating of the highest age-rated creator content available in the app, and communicate to users which content requires additional purchases.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li data-sidenav="1.3 Kids Category" id="kids-category"><span id="1.3"></span><strong>1.3 Kids Category</strong>
								<p>The Kids Category is a great way for people to easily find apps that are designed for children. If you want to participate in the Kids Category, you should focus on creating a great experience specifically for younger users. These apps must not include links out of the app, purchasing opportunities, or other distractions to kids unless reserved for a designated area behind a parental gate. Keep in mind that once customers expect your app to follow the Kids Category requirements, it will need to continue to meet these guidelines in subsequent updates, even if you decide to deselect the category. Learn more about <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/kids-apps/">parental gates</a>.</p>
								<p>You must comply with applicable privacy laws around the world relating to the collection of data from children online. Be sure to review the <a href="#privacy">Privacy section</a> of these guidelines for more information. In addition, Kids Category apps may not send personally identifiable information or device information to third parties. Apps in the Kids Category should not include third-party analytics or third-party advertising. This provides a safer experience for kids. In limited cases, third-party analytics may be permitted provided that the services do not collect or transmit the IDFA or any identifiable information about children (such as name, date of birth, email address), their location, or their devices. This includes any device, network, or other information that could be used directly or combined with other information to identify users and their devices. Third-party contextual advertising may also be permitted in limited cases provided that the services have publicly documented practices and policies for Kids Category apps that include human review of ad creatives for age appropriateness.</p>

								<p data-nr="">If your app behaves in a way that risks physical harm, we may reject it. For example:</p>
								<ul>
									<li data-nr="" id="1.4.1"><strong>1.4.1</strong><span><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"></span> Medical apps that could provide inaccurate data or information, or that could be used for diagnosing or treating patients may be reviewed with greater scrutiny.
										<ul>
											<li data-nr="">Apps must clearly disclose data and methodology to support accuracy claims relating to health measurements, and if the level of accuracy or methodology cannot be validated, we will reject your app. For example, apps that claim to take x-rays, measure blood pressure, body temperature, blood glucose levels, or blood oxygen levels using only the sensors on the device are not permitted.</li>
											<li data-nr="">Apps should remind users to check with a doctor in addition to using the app and before making medical decisions.</li>
										</ul> If your medical app has received regulatory clearance, please submit a link to that documentation with your app.</li>
									<li data-nr="" id="1.4.2"><strong>1.4.2</strong><span><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"></span> Drug dosage calculators must come from the drug manufacturer, a hospital, university, health insurance company, pharmacy or other approved entity, or receive approval by the FDA or one of its international counterparts. Given the potential harm to patients, we need to be sure that the app will be supported and updated over the long term.</li>
									<li id="1.4.3"><strong>1.4.3</strong> Apps that encourage consumption of tobacco and vape products, illegal drugs, or excessive amounts of alcohol are not permitted. Apps that encourage minors to consume any of these substances will be rejected. Facilitating the sale of controlled substances (except for licensed pharmacies and licensed or otherwise legal cannabis dispensaries), or tobacco is not allowed.</li>
									<li data-nr="" id="1.4.4"><strong>1.4.4</strong><span><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"></span> Apps may only display DUI checkpoints that are published by law enforcement agencies, and should never encourage drunk driving or other reckless behavior such as excessive speed.</li>
									<li data-nr="" id="1.4.5"><strong>1.4.5</strong><span><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"></span> Apps should not urge customers to participate in activities (like bets, challenges, etc.) or use their devices in a way that risks physical harm to themselves or others.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li data-nr="" data-sidenav="1.5 Developer Information" id="developer-information"><span id="1.5"></span><strong>1.5<span><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"></span> Developer Information</strong>
								<p data-nr="">People need to know how to reach you with questions and support issues. Make sure your app and its Support URL include an easy way to contact you; this is particularly important for apps that may be used in the classroom. Failure to include accurate and up-to-date contact information not only frustrates customers, but may violate the law in some countries or regions. Also ensure that Wallet passes include valid contact information from the issuer and are signed with a dedicated certificate assigned to the brand or trademark owner of the pass.</p>
							</li>
							<li data-nr="" data-sidenav="1.6 Data Security" id="data-security"><span id="1.6"></span><strong>1.6<span><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"></span> Data Security</strong>
								<p data-nr="">Apps should implement appropriate security measures to ensure proper handling of user information collected pursuant to the Apple&nbsp;Developer Program License Agreement and these Guidelines (see Guideline 5.1 for more information) and prevent its unauthorized use, disclosure, or access by third parties.</p>
							</li>
							<li data-sidenav="1.7 Reporting Criminal Activity"><span id="1.7"></span><strong>1.7 Reporting Criminal Activity</strong>
								<p>Apps for reporting alleged criminal activity must involve local law enforcement, and can only be offered in countries or regions where such involvement is active.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 data-nr="" data-sidenav="" id="performance"><span id="2"></span>2. Performance</h3>
						<ul>
							<li data-nr="" data-sidenav="2.1 App Completeness" id="app-completeness"><span id="2.1"></span><strong>2.1 App Completeness</strong>
								<ul>
									<li data-nr=""><strong>(a)</strong><span><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"></span> Submissions to App&nbsp;Review, including apps you make available for pre-order, should be final versions with all necessary metadata and fully functional URLs included; placeholder text, empty websites, and other temporary content should be scrubbed before submission. Make sure your app has been tested on-device for bugs and stability before you submit it, and include demo account info (and turn on your back-end service!) if your app includes a login. If you are unable to provide a demo account due to legal or security obligations, you may include a built-in demo mode in lieu of a demo account with prior approval by Apple. Ensure the demo mode exhibits your app’s full features and functionality. We will reject incomplete app bundles and binaries that crash or exhibit obvious technical problems.</li>
									<li><strong>(b)</strong> If you offer in-app purchases in your app, make sure they are complete, up-to-date, visible to the reviewer and functional. If any configured in-app purchase items cannot be found or reviewed in your app, explain the reason in your review notes.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li data-sidenav="2.2 Beta Testing" id="beta-testing"><span id="2.2"></span><strong>2.2 Beta Testing</strong>
								<p>Demos, betas, and trial versions of your app don’t belong on the App&nbsp;Store&nbsp;– use TestFlight instead. Any app submitted for beta distribution via TestFlight should be intended for public distribution and should comply with the App&nbsp;Review Guidelines. Note, however, that apps using TestFlight cannot be distributed to testers in exchange for compensation of any kind, including as a reward for crowd-sourced funding. Significant updates to your beta build should be submitted to TestFlight App&nbsp;Review before being distributed to your testers. To learn more, visit the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/testflight/">TestFlight Beta Testing</a> page.</p>
							</li>
							<li data-nr="" data-sidenav="2.3 Accurate Metadata" id="accurate-metadata"><span id="2.3"></span><strong>2.3<span><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"></span> Accurate Metadata</strong>
								<p data-nr="">Customers should know what they’re getting when they download or buy your app, so make sure all your app metadata, including privacy information, your app description, screenshots, and previews accurately reflect the app’s core experience and remember to keep them up-to-date with new versions.</p>
								<ul>
									<li data-nr="" id="2.3.1"><strong>2.3.1</strong>
										<ul>
											<li data-nr=""><strong>(a)</strong><span><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"></span> Don’t include any hidden, dormant, or undocumented features in your app; your app’s functionality should be clear to end users and App&nbsp;Review. All new features, functionality, and product changes must be described with specificity in the Notes for Review section of App&nbsp;Store&nbsp;Connect (generic descriptions will be rejected) and accessible for review. Similarly, marketing your app in a misleading way, such as by promoting content or services that it does not actually offer (e.g. iOS-based virus and malware scanners) or promoting a false price, whether within or outside of the App&nbsp;Store, is grounds for removal of your app from the App&nbsp;Store or a block from installing via alternative distribution and termination of your developer account.</li>
											<li><strong>(b)</strong> Egregious or repeated behavior is grounds for removal from the Apple&nbsp;Developer Program. We work hard to make the App&nbsp;Store a trustworthy ecosystem and expect our app developers to follow suit; if you’re dishonest, we don’t want to do business with you.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li id="2.3.2"><strong>2.3.2</strong> If your app includes in-app purchases, make sure your app description, screenshots, and previews clearly indicate whether any featured items, levels, subscriptions, etc. require additional purchases. If you decide to promote in-app purchases on the App&nbsp;Store, ensure that the in-app purchase Display Name, Screenshot and Description are appropriate for a public audience, that you follow the guidance found in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/promoting-in-app-purchases/">Promoting Your In-App Purchases</a>, and that your app properly handles the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skpaymenttransactionobserver/2877502-paymentqueue">SKPaymentTransactionObserver method<span></span></a> so that customers can seamlessly complete the purchase when your app launches.</li>
									<li id="2.3.3"><strong>2.3.3</strong> Screenshots should show the app in use, and not merely the title art, login page, or splash screen. They may also include text and image overlays (e.g. to demonstrate input mechanisms, such as an animated touch point or Apple&nbsp;Pencil) and show extended functionality on device, such as Touch&nbsp;Bar.</li>
									<li id="2.3.4"><strong>2.3.4</strong> Previews are a great way for customers to see what your app looks like and what it does. To ensure people understand what they’ll be getting with your app, previews may only use video screen captures of the app itself. Stickers and iMessage extensions may show the user experience in the Messages app. You can add narration and video or textual overlays to help explain anything that isn’t clear from the video alone.</li>
									<li data-nr="" id="2.3.5"><strong>2.3.5</strong><span><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"></span> Select the most appropriate category for your app, and check out the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/categories/">App&nbsp;Store Category Definitions</a> if you need help. If you’re way off base, we may change the category for you.</li>
									<li data-nr="" id="2.3.6"><strong>2.3.6</strong><span><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"></span> Answer the age rating questions in App&nbsp;Store&nbsp;Connect honestly so that your app aligns properly with parental controls. If your app is mis-rated, customers might be surprised by what they get, or it could trigger an inquiry from government regulators. If your app includes media that requires the display of content ratings or warnings (e.g. films, music, games, etc.), you are responsible for complying with local requirements in each territory where your app is available.</li>
									<li data-nr="" id="2.3.7"><strong>2.3.7</strong><span><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"></span> Choose a unique app name, assign keywords that accurately describe your app, and don’t try to pack any of your metadata with trademarked terms, popular app names, pricing information, or other irrelevant phrases just to game the system. App names must be limited to 30 characters. Metadata such as app names, subtitles, screenshots, and previews should not include prices, terms, or descriptions that are not specific to the metadata type. App subtitles are a great way to provide additional context for your app; they must follow our standard metadata rules and should not include inappropriate content, reference other apps, or make unverifiable product claims. Apple may modify inappropriate keywords at any time or take other appropriate steps to prevent abuse.</li>
									<li data-nr="" id="2.3.8"><strong>2.3.8</strong><span><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"></span> Metadata should be appropriate for all audiences, so make sure your app and in-app purchase icons, screenshots, and previews adhere to a 4+ age rating even if your app is rated higher. For example, if your app is a game that includes violence, select images that don’t depict a gruesome death or a gun pointed at a specific character. Use of terms like “For Kids” and “For Children” in app metadata is reserved in the App&nbsp;Store for the Kids&nbsp;Category. Remember to ensure your metadata, including app name and icons (small, large, Apple&nbsp;Watch app, alternate icons, etc.), are similar to avoid creating confusion.</li>
									<li id="2.3.9"><strong>2.3.9</strong> You are responsible for securing the rights to use all materials in your app icons, screenshots, and previews, and you should display fictional account information instead of data from a real person.</li>
									<li id="2.3.10"><strong>2.3.10</strong> Make sure your app is focused on the experience of the Apple platforms it supports, and don’t include names, icons, or imagery of other mobile platforms or alternative app marketplaces in your app or metadata, unless there is specific, approved interactive functionality. Make sure your app metadata is focused on the app itself and its experience. Don’t include irrelevant information.</li>
									<li id="2.3.11"><strong>2.3.11</strong> Apps you submit for pre-order on the App&nbsp;Store must be complete and deliverable as submitted. Ensure that the app you ultimately release is not materially different from what you advertise while the app is in a pre-order state. If you make material changes to the app (e.g. change business models), you should restart your pre-order sales.</li>
									<li id="2.3.12"><strong>2.3.12</strong> Apps must clearly describe new features and product changes in their “What’s New” text. Simple bug fixes, security updates, and performance improvements may rely on a generic description, but more significant changes must be listed in the notes.</li>
									<li id="2.3.13"><strong>2.3.13</strong> In-app events are timely events that happen within your app. To feature your event on the App&nbsp;Store, it must fall within an event type provided in App&nbsp;Store&nbsp;Connect. All event metadata must be accurate and pertain to the event itself, rather than the app more generally. Events must happen at the times and dates you select in App&nbsp;Store&nbsp;Connect, including across multiple storefronts. You may monetize your event so long as you follow the rules set forth in Section 3 on Business. And your event deep link must direct users to the proper destination within your app. Read <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/in-app-events/">In-App Events</a> for detailed guidance on acceptable event metadata and event deep links.</li>

									<li id="2.4.1"><strong>2.4.1</strong> To ensure people get the most out of your app, iPhone apps should run on iPad whenever possible. We encourage you to consider building apps so customers can use them on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-a-multiplatform-app-target">all of their devices</a>.</li>

Apps should not rapidly drain battery, generate excessive heat, or put unnecessary strain on device resources. For example, apps should not encourage placing the device under a mattress or pillow while charging or perform excessive write cycles to the solid state drive. Apps, including any third-party advertisements displayed within them, may not run unrelated background processes, such as cryptocurrency mining.</li>
									<li id="2.4.3"><strong>2.4.3</strong> People should be able to use your Apple&nbsp;TV app without the need for hardware inputs beyond the Siri remote or third-party game controllers, but feel free to provide enhanced functionality when other peripherals are connected. If you require a game controller, make sure you clearly explain that in your metadata so customers know they need additional equipment to play.</li>

									<li id="2.4.5"><strong>2.4.5</strong> Apps distributed via the Mac&nbsp;App&nbsp;Store have some additional requirements to keep in mind:
										<ul>

They should also only use the appropriate macOS APIs for modifying user data stored by other apps (e.g. bookmarks, Address Book, or Calendar entries).</li>
											<li><strong>(ii)</strong> They must be packaged and submitted using technologies provided in Xcode; no third-party installers allowed. They must also be self-contained, single app installation bundles and cannot install code or resources in shared locations.</li>
											<li><strong>(iii)</strong> They may not auto-launch or have other code run automatically at startup or login without consent nor spawn processes that continue to run without consent after a user has quit the app. They should not automatically add their icons to the Dock or leave shortcuts on the user desktop.</li>
											<li><strong>(iv)</strong> They may not download or install standalone apps, kexts, additional code, or resources to add functionality or significantly change the app from what we see during the review process.</li>
											<li><strong>(v)</strong> They may not request escalation to root privileges or use setuid attributes.</li>
											<li><strong>(vi)</strong> They may not present a license screen at launch, require license keys, or implement their own copy protection.</li>
											<li><strong>(vii)</strong> They must use the Mac&nbsp;App&nbsp;Store to distribute updates; other update mechanisms are not allowed.</li>
											<li><strong>(viii)</strong> Apps should run on the currently shipping OS and may not use deprecated or optionally installed technologies (e.g. Java)</li>
											<li><strong>(ix)</strong> Apps must contain all language and localization support in a single app bundle.</li>

						<p>There are many ways to monetize your app on the App&nbsp;Store. If your business model isn’t obvious, make sure to explain in its metadata and App&nbsp;Review notes. If we can’t understand how your app works or your in-app purchases aren’t immediately obvious, it will delay your review and may trigger a rejection. And while pricing is up to you, we won’t distribute apps and in-app purchase items that are clear rip-offs. We’ll reject expensive apps that try to cheat users with irrationally high prices.</p>
						<p>If we find that you have attempted to manipulate reviews, inflate your chart rankings with paid, incentivized, filtered, or fake feedback, or engage with third-party services to do so on your behalf, we will take steps to preserve the integrity of the App&nbsp;Store, which may include expelling you from the Apple&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;Program.</p>

										<ul>
											<li>If you want to unlock features or functionality within your app, (by way of example: subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use in-app purchase. Apps may not use their own mechanisms to unlock content or functionality, such as license keys, augmented reality markers, QR codes, cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency wallets, etc.</li>
											<li>Apps may use in-app purchase currencies to enable customers to “tip” the developer or digital content providers in the app.</li>
											<li>Any credits or in-game currencies purchased via in-app purchase may not expire, and you should make sure you have a restore mechanism for any restorable in-app purchases.</li>
											<li>Apps may enable gifting of items that are eligible for in-app purchase to others. Such gifts may only be refunded to the original purchaser and may not be exchanged.</li>
											<li>Apps distributed via the Mac&nbsp;App&nbsp;Store may host plug-ins or extensions that are enabled with mechanisms other than the App&nbsp;Store.</li>
											<li>Apps offering “loot boxes” or other mechanisms that provide randomized virtual items for purchase must disclose the odds of receiving each type of item to customers prior to purchase.</li>
											<li>Digital gift cards, certificates, vouchers, and coupons which can be redeemed for digital goods or services can only be sold in your app using in-app purchase. Physical gift cards that are sold within an app and then mailed to customers may use payment methods other than in-app purchase.</li>
											<li>Non-subscription apps may offer a free time-based trial period before presenting a full unlock option by setting up a Non-Consumable IAP item at Price Tier 0 that follows the naming convention: “XX-day Trial.” Prior to the start of the trial, your app must clearly identify its duration, the content or services that will no longer be accessible when the trial ends, and any downstream charges the user would need to pay for full functionality. Learn more about managing content access and the duration of the trial period using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/original_api_for_in-app_purchase/choosing_a_receipt_validation_technique">Receipts<span></span></a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck">DeviceCheck<span></span></a>.</li>
											<li>Apps may use in-app purchase to sell and sell services related to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), such as minting, listing, and transferring. Apps may allow users to view their own NFTs, provided that NFT ownership does not unlock features or functionality within the app. Apps may allow users to browse NFT collections owned by others, provided that, except for apps on the United States storefront, the apps may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.</li>

In accordance with the entitlement agreements, the link may inform users about where and how to purchase those in-app purchase items, and the fact that such items may be available for a comparatively lower price. The entitlements are limited to use only in the iOS or iPadOS App&nbsp;Store in specific storefronts. In all other storefronts, except for the United States storefront, where this prohibition does not apply, apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.</li>
											<li>Music Streaming Services Entitlements: music streaming apps in specific regions can use Music Streaming Services Entitlements to include a link (which may take the form of a buy button) to the developer’s website that informs users of other ways to purchase digital music content or services. These entitlements also permit music streaming app developers to invite users to provide their email address for the express purpose of sending them a link to the developer’s website to purchase digital music content or services. Learn more about these <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/external_purchase">entitlements<span></span></a>. In accordance with the entitlement agreements, the link may inform users about where and how to purchase those in-app purchase items, and the price of such items.

									<li id="permissible-uses"><span id="3.1.2a"></span><strong>3.1.2(a) Permissible uses:</strong> If you offer an auto-renewable subscription, you must provide ongoing value to the customer, and the subscription period must last at least seven days and be available across all of the user’s devices. While the following list is not exhaustive, examples of appropriate subscriptions include: new game levels; episodic content; multiplayer support; apps that offer consistent, substantive updates; access to large collections of, or continually updated, media content; software as a service (“SAAS”); and cloud support. In addition: 
										<ul>
											<li>Subscriptions may be offered alongside à la carte offerings (e.g. you may offer a subscription to an entire library of films as well the purchase or rental of a single movie).</li>
											<li>You may offer a single subscription that is shared across your own apps and services.</li>
											<li>Games offered in a streaming game service subscription may offer a single subscription that is shared across third-party apps and services; however, they must be downloaded directly from the App&nbsp;Store, must be designed to avoid duplicate payment by a subscriber, and should not disadvantage non-subscriber customers.</li>
											<li>Subscriptions must work on all of the user’s devices where the app is available. Learn more about <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/offering_a_subscription_across_multiple_apps">sharing a subscription across your apps<span></span></a>. </li>
											<li>Apps must not force users to rate the app, review the app, download other apps, or other similar actions in order to access functionality, content, or use of the app.</li>
											<li>As with all apps, those offering subscriptions should allow a user to get what they’ve paid for without performing additional tasks, such as posting on social media, uploading contacts, checking in to the app a certain number of times, etc.</li>
											<li>Subscriptions may include consumable credits, gems, in-game currencies, etc., and you may offer subscriptions that include access to discounted consumable goods (e.g. a platinum membership that exposes gem-packs for a reduced price).</li>
											<li>If you are changing your existing app to a subscription-based business model, you should not take away the primary functionality existing users have already paid for. For example, let customers who have already purchased a “full game unlock” continue to access the full game after you introduce a subscription model for new customers.</li>
											<li>Auto-renewable subscription apps may offer a free trial period to customers by providing the relevant information set forth in App&nbsp;Store&nbsp;Connect. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/subscriptions/#providing-subscription-offers">Learn more about providing subscription offers.</a></li>
											<li>Apps that attempt to scam users will be removed from the App&nbsp;Store. This includes apps that attempt to trick users into purchasing a subscription under false pretenses or engage in bait-and-switch and scam practices; these will be removed from the App&nbsp;Store and you may be removed from the Apple&nbsp;Developer Program.</li>
											<li>Cellular carrier apps may include auto-renewable music and video subscriptions when purchased in bundles with new cellular data plans, with prior approval by Apple. Other auto-renewable subscriptions may also be included in bundles when purchased with new cellular data plans, with prior approval by Apple, if the cellular carrier apps support in-app purchase for users. Such subscriptions cannot include access to or discounts on consumable items, and the subscriptions must terminate coincident with the cellular data plan.</li>

						<p>Apple customers place a high value on products that are simple, refined, innovative, and easy to use, and that’s what we want to see on the App&nbsp;Store. Coming up with a great design is up to you, but the following are minimum standards for approval to the App&nbsp;Store. And remember that even after your app has been approved, you should update your app to ensure it remains functional and engaging to new and existing customers. Apps that stop working or offer a degraded experience may be removed from the App&nbsp;Store at any time.</p>

Don’t simply copy the latest popular app on the App&nbsp;Store, or make some minor changes to another app’s name or UI and pass it off as your own. In addition to risking an intellectual property infringement claim, it makes the App&nbsp;Store harder to navigate and just isn’t fair to your fellow developers.</li>

If your App doesn’t provide some sort of lasting entertainment value or adequate utility, it may not be accepted. Apps that are simply a song or movie should be submitted to the iTunes&nbsp;Store.

											<li><strong>(b)</strong> Any software or services appearing in the client are fully executed on the host device, rendered on the screen of the host device, and may not use APIs or platform features beyond what is required to stream the Remote Desktop.</li>
											<li><strong>(c)</strong> All account creation and management must be initiated from the host device.</li>
											<li><strong>(d)</strong> The UI appearing on the client does not resemble an iOS or App&nbsp;Store view, does not provide a store-like interface, or include the ability to browse, select, or purchase software not already owned or licensed by the user.

										<ul>
											<li data-nr=""><strong>(i)</strong> MusicKit on iOS lets users play Apple&nbsp;Music and their local music library natively from your apps and games. When a user provides permission to their Apple&nbsp;Music account, your app can create playlists, add songs to their library, and play any of the millions of songs in the Apple&nbsp;Music catalog. Users must initiate the playback of an Apple&nbsp;Music stream and be able to navigate using standard media controls such as “play,” “pause,” and “skip.” Moreover, your app may not require payment or indirectly monetize access to the Apple&nbsp;Music service (e.g. in-app purchase, advertising, requesting user info, etc.). Do not download, upload, or enable sharing of music files sourced from the MusicKit APIs, except as explicitly permitted in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/musickit/">MusicKit<span></span></a> documentation.</li>
											<li data-nr=""><strong>(ii)</strong> Using the MusicKit APIs is not a replacement for securing the licenses you might need for a deeper or more complex music integration. For example, if you want your app to play a specific song at a particular moment, or to create audio or video files that can be shared to social media, you’ll need to contact rights-holders directly to get their permission (e.g. synchronization or adaptation rights) and assets. Cover art and other metadata may only be used in connection with music playback or playlists (including screenshots displaying your app’s functionality), and should not be used in any marketing or advertising without getting specific authorization from rights-holders. Make sure to follow the <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/marketing-on-music/identity-guidelines.html">Apple&nbsp;Music Identity Guidelines<span></span></a> when integrating Apple&nbsp;Music services in your app.</li>
											<li data-nr=""><strong>(iii)</strong> Apps that access Apple&nbsp;Music user data, such as playlists and favorites, must clearly disclose this access in the purpose string. Any data collected may not be shared with third parties for any purpose other than supporting or improving the app experience. This data may not be used to identify users or devices, or to target advertising. </li>

										<ul>
											<li data-nr=""><strong>(i) Privacy Policies: </strong>All apps must include a link to their privacy policy in the App&nbsp;Store&nbsp;Connect metadata field and within the app in an easily accessible manner. The privacy policy must clearly and explicitly:
												<ul>
													<li data-nr="">Identify what data, if any, the app/service collects, how it collects that data, and all uses of that data.</li>
													<li data-nr="">Confirm that any third party with whom an app shares user data (in compliance with these Guidelines)—such as analytics tools, advertising networks and third-party SDKs, as well as any parent, subsidiary or other related entities that will have access to user data—will provide the same or equal protection of user data as stated in the app’s privacy policy and required by these Guidelines.</li>
													<li data-nr="">Explain its data retention/deletion policies and describe how a user can revoke consent and/or request deletion of the user’s data.</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li data-nr=""><strong>(ii) Permission: </strong>Apps that collect user or usage data must secure user consent for the collection, even if such data is considered to be anonymous at the time of or immediately following collection. Paid functionality must not be dependent on or require a user to grant access to this data. Apps must also provide the customer with an easily accessible and understandable way to withdraw consent. Ensure your purpose strings clearly and completely describe your use of the data. Apps that collect data for a legitimate interest without consent by relying on the terms of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or similar statute must comply with all terms of that law. Learn more about <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/protecting_the_user_s_privacy">Requesting Permission<span></span></a>.</li>
											<li data-nr=""><strong>(iii) Data Minimization: </strong>Apps should only request access to data relevant to the core functionality of the app and should only collect and use data that is required to accomplish the relevant task. Where possible, use the out-of-process picker or a share sheet rather than requesting full access to protected resources like Photos or Contacts.</li>
											<li data-nr=""><strong>(iv) Access: </strong>Apps must respect the user’s permission settings and not attempt to manipulate, trick, or force people to consent to unnecessary data access. For example, apps that include the ability to post photos to a social network must not also require microphone access before allowing the user to upload photos. Where possible, provide alternative solutions for users who don’t grant consent. For example, if a user declines to share Location, offer the ability to manually enter an address.</li>
											<li data-nr="" id="5.1.1v"><strong>(v) Account Sign-In: </strong>If your app doesn’t include significant account-based features, let people use it without a login. If your app supports account creation, you must also <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/offering-account-deletion-in-your-app/">offer account deletion within the app</a>. Apps may not require users to enter personal information to function, except when directly relevant to the core functionality of the app or required by law. If your core app functionality is not related to a specific social network (e.g. Facebook, WeChat, Weibo, X, etc.), you must provide access without a login or via another mechanism. Pulling basic profile information, sharing to the social network, or inviting friends to use the app are not considered core app functionality. The app must also include a mechanism to revoke social network credentials and disable data access between the app and social network from within the app. An app may not store credentials or tokens to social networks off of the device and may only use such credentials or tokens to directly connect to the social network from the app itself while the app is in use.</li>
											<li data-nr=""><strong>(vi) </strong>Developers that use their apps to surreptitiously discover passwords or other private data will be removed from the Apple&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;Program.</li>
											<li data-nr=""><strong>(vii) </strong>SafariViewController must be used to visibly present information to users; the controller may not be hidden or obscured by other views or layers. Additionally, an app may not use SafariViewController to track users without their knowledge and consent.</li>
											<li data-nr=""><strong>(viii) </strong>Apps that compile personal information from any source that is not directly from the user or without the user’s explicit consent, even public databases, are not permitted on the App&nbsp;Store or alternative app marketplaces.</li>
											<li data-nr=""><strong>(ix) </strong>Apps that provide services in highly regulated fields (such as banking and financial services, healthcare, gambling, legal cannabis use, and air travel) or that require sensitive user information should be submitted by a legal entity that provides the services, and not by an individual developer. Apps that facilitate the legal sale of cannabis must be geo-restricted to the corresponding legal jurisdiction.</li>
											<li data-nr=""><strong>(x) </strong>Apps may request basic contact information (such as name and email address) so long as the request is optional for the user, features and services are not conditional on providing the information, and it complies with all other provisions of these guidelines, including limitations on collecting information from kids.</li>

										<p data-nr="">Health, fitness, and medical data are especially sensitive and apps in this space have some additional rules to make sure customer privacy is protected:</p>
										<ul>
											<li data-nr=""><strong>(i)</strong> Apps may not use or disclose to third parties data gathered in the health, fitness, and medical research context—including from the Clinical Health Records API, HealthKit&nbsp;API, Motion and Fitness, MovementDisorder APIs, or health-related human subject research—for advertising, marketing, or other use-based data mining purposes other than improving health management, or for the purpose of health research, and then only with permission. Apps may, however, use a user’s health or fitness data to provide a benefit directly to that user (such as a reduced insurance premium), provided that the app is submitted by the entity providing the benefit, and the data is not shared with a third party. You must disclose the specific health data that you are collecting from the device.</li>
											<li data-nr=""><strong>(ii)</strong> Apps must not write false or inaccurate data into HealthKit or any other medical research or health management apps, and may not store personal health information in iCloud.</li>
											<li data-nr=""><strong>(iii)</strong> Apps conducting health-related human subject research must obtain consent from participants or, in the case of minors, their parent or guardian. Such consent must include the (a) nature, purpose, and duration of the research; (b) procedures, risks, and benefits to the participant; (c) information about confidentiality and handling of data (including any sharing with third parties); (d) a point of contact for participant questions; and (e) the withdrawal process.</li>

											<li data-nr="">
												<p data-nr=""><strong>(a)</strong><span><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"></span> For many reasons, it is critical to use care when dealing with personal data from kids, and we encourage you to carefully review all the requirements for complying with laws like the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), and any other applicable regulations or laws.</p>
												<p data-nr="">Apps may ask for birthdate and parental contact information only for the purpose of complying with these statutes, but must include some useful functionality or entertainment value regardless of a person’s age.</p>
												<p data-nr="">Apps intended primarily for kids should not include third-party analytics or third-party advertising. This provides a safer experience for kids.</p>
											</li>
											<li data-nr="">
												<p><strong>(b)</strong> In limited cases, third-party analytics and third-party advertising may be permitted provided that the services adhere to the same terms set forth in <a href="#1.3">Guideline 1.3</a>.</p>
												<p>Moreover, apps in the Kids Category or those that collect, transmit, or have the capability to share personal information (e.g. name, address, email, location, photos, videos, drawings, the ability to chat, other personal data, or persistent identifiers used in combination with any of the above) from a minor must include a privacy policy and must comply with all applicable children’s privacy statutes. For the sake of clarity, the <a href="#kids-category">parental gate requirement</a> for the Kid’s Category is generally not the same as securing parental consent to collect personal data under these privacy statutes.</p>
												<p>As a reminder, <a href="#2.3.8">Guideline 2.3.8</a> requires that use of terms like “For Kids” and “For Children” in app metadata is reserved for the Kids Category. Apps not in the Kids Category cannot include any terms in app name, subtitle, icon, screenshots or description that imply the main audience for the app is children.</p>

										<p data-nr="">Use Location Services in your app only when it is directly relevant to the features and services provided by the app. Location-based APIs shouldn’t be used to provide emergency services or autonomous control over vehicles, aircraft, and other devices, except for small devices such as lightweight drones and toys, or remote control car alarm systems, etc. Ensure that you notify and obtain consent before collecting, transmitting, or using location data. If your app uses Location Services, be sure to explain the purpose in your app; refer to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/patterns/accessing-private-data/">Human Interface Guidelines<span></span></a> for best practices for doing so.</p>

							<li data-sidenav="5.2 Intellectual Property" id="intellectual-property"><span id="5.2"></span><strong>5.2 Intellectual Property</strong>
								<p>Make sure your app only includes content that you created or that you have a license to use. Your app may be removed if you’ve stepped over the line and used content without permission. Of course, this also means someone else’s app may be removed if they’ve “borrowed” from your work. If you believe your intellectual property has been infringed by another developer on the App&nbsp;Store, submit a claim via our <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/appstorenotices/">web form<span></span></a>. Laws differ in different countries and regions, but at the very least, make sure to avoid the following common errors:</p>
								<ul>
									<li id="5.2.1"><strong>5.2.1 Generally:</strong> Don’t use protected third-party material such as trademarks, copyrighted works, or patented ideas in your app without permission, and don’t include misleading, false, or copycat representations, names, or metadata in your app bundle or developer name. Apps should be submitted by the person or legal entity that owns or has licensed the intellectual property and other relevant rights.</li>
									<li id="5.2.2"><strong>5.2.2 Third-Party Sites/Services:</strong> If your app uses, accesses, monetizes access to, or displays content from a third-party service, ensure that you are specifically permitted to do so under the service’s terms of use. Authorization must be provided upon request.</li>
									<li id="5.2.3"><strong>5.2.3 Audio/Video Downloading:</strong> Apps should not facilitate illegal file sharing or include the ability to save, convert, or download media from third-party sources (e.g. Apple&nbsp;Music, YouTube, SoundCloud, Vimeo, etc.) without explicit authorization from those sources. Streaming of audio/video content may also violate Terms of Use, so be sure to check before your app accesses those services. Authorization must be provided upon request.</li>
									<li data-nr="" id="5.2.4"><strong>5.2.4 Apple Endorsements</strong>
										<ul>
											<li data-nr=""><strong>(a)</strong><span><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"></span> Don’t suggest or imply that Apple is a source or supplier of the App, or that Apple endorses any particular representation regarding quality or functionality.</li>
											<li><strong>(b)</strong> If your app is selected as an “Editor’s Choice,” Apple will apply the badge automatically.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li data-nr="" id="5.2.5"><strong>5.2.5<span><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"></span> Apple Products:</strong> Don’t create an app that appears confusingly similar to an existing Apple product, interface (e.g. Finder), app (such as the App&nbsp;Store, iTunes&nbsp;Store, or Messages) or advertising theme. Apps and extensions, including third-party keyboards and Sticker packs, may not include Apple emoji. Music from iTunes and Apple&nbsp;Music previews may not be used for their entertainment value (e.g. as the background music to a photo collage or the soundtrack to a game) or in any other unauthorized manner. If you provide music previews from iTunes or Apple&nbsp;Music, you must display a link to the corresponding music in iTunes or Apple&nbsp;Music. If your app displays Activity rings, they should not visualize Move, Exercise, or Stand data in a way that resembles the Activity control. The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/patterns/workouts/#activity-rings">Human Interface Guidelines<span></span></a> have more information on how to use Activity rings. If your app displays Apple Weather data, it should follow the attribution requirements provided in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/weatherkit/get-started/#attribution-requirements">WeatherKit documentation</a>.</li>

							<li data-sidenav="5.3 Gaming, Gambling, and Lotteries" id="gaming-gambling-and-lotteries"><span id="5.3"></span><strong>5.3 Gaming, Gambling, and Lotteries</strong>
								<p data-nr="">Gaming, gambling, and lotteries can be tricky to manage and tend to be one of the most regulated offerings on the App&nbsp;Store. Only include this functionality if you’ve fully vetted your legal obligations everywhere you make your app available and are prepared for extra time during the review process. Some things to keep in mind:</p>
								<ul>
									<li id="5.3.1"><strong>5.3.1</strong> Sweepstakes and contests must be sponsored by the developer of the app.</li>
									<li id="5.3.2"><strong>5.3.2</strong> Official rules for sweepstakes, contests, and raffles must be presented in the app and make clear that Apple is not a sponsor or involved in the activity in any manner.</li>
									<li id="5.3.3"><strong>5.3.3</strong> Apps may not use in-app purchase to purchase credit or currency for use in conjunction with real money gaming of any kind.</li>
									<li id="5.3.4"><strong>5.3.4</strong> Apps that offer real money gaming (e.g. sports betting, poker, casino games, horse racing) or lotteries must have necessary licensing and permissions in the locations where the app is used, must be geo-restricted to those locations, and must be free on the App&nbsp;Store. Illegal gambling aids, including card counters, are not permitted on the App&nbsp;Store. Lottery apps must have consideration, chance, and a prize.</li>
								</ul>

							<li data-nr="" data-sidenav="5.4 VPN Apps" id="vpn-apps"><span id="5.4"></span><strong>5.4<span><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"></span> VPN Apps</strong>
								<p data-nr="">Apps offering VPN services must utilize the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/nevpnmanager">NEVPNManager API<span></span></a> and may only be offered by developers enrolled as an organization. You must make a clear declaration of what user data will be collected and how it will be used on an app screen prior to any user action to purchase or otherwise use the service. Apps offering VPN services may not sell, use, or disclose to third parties any data for any purpose, and must commit to this in their privacy policy. VPN apps must not violate local laws, and if you choose to make your VPN app available in a territory that requires a VPN license, you must provide your license information in the App&nbsp;Review Notes field. Parental control, content blocking, and security apps, among others, from approved providers may also use the NEVPNManager API. Apps that do not comply with this guideline will be removed from the App&nbsp;Store and blocked from installing via alternative distribution and you may be removed from the Apple&nbsp;Developer Program.</p>
							</li>
							<li data-nr="" data-sidenav="5.5 Mobile Device Management" id="mobile-device-management"><span id="5.5"></span><strong>5.5<span><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"></span> Mobile Device Management</strong>
								<p data-nr="">Mobile Device Management Apps that offer Mobile Device Management (MDM) services must request this capability from Apple. Such apps may only be offered by commercial enterprises, educational institutions, or government agencies, and in limited cases, companies using MDM for parental control services or device security. You must make a clear declaration of what user data will be collected and how it will be used on an app screen prior to any user action to purchase or otherwise use the service. MDM apps must not violate any applicable laws. Apps offering MDM services may not sell, use, or disclose to third parties any data for any purpose, and must commit to this in their privacy policy. In limited cases, third-party analytics may be permitted provided that the services only collect or transmit data about the performance of the developer’s MDM app, and not any data about the user, the user’s device, or other apps used on that device. Apps offering configuration profiles must also adhere to these requirements. Apps that do not comply with this guideline will be removed from the App&nbsp;Store and blocked from installing via alternative distribution and you may be removed from the Apple&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;Program.</p>
							</li>
							<li data-nr="" data-sidenav="5.6 Developer Code of Conduct" id="code-of-conduct"><span id="5.6"></span><strong>5.6<span><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"></span> Developer Code of Conduct</strong>
								<p data-nr="">Please treat everyone with respect, whether in your responses to App&nbsp;Store reviews, customer support requests, or when communicating with Apple, including your responses in App&nbsp;Store&nbsp;Connect. Do not engage in harassment of any kind, discriminatory practices, intimidation, bullying, and don’t encourage others to engage in any of the above. Repeated manipulative or misleading behavior or other fraudulent conduct will lead to your removal from the Apple&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;Program.</p>
								<p data-nr="">Customer trust is a cornerstone of the App ecosystem. Apps should never prey on users or attempt to rip off customers, trick them into making unwanted purchases, force them to share unnecessary data, raise prices in a tricky manner, charge for features or content that are not delivered, or engage in any other manipulative practices within or outside of the app.</p>
								<p data-nr="">Your Developer Program account will be terminated if you engage in activities or actions that are not in accordance with the Developer Code of Conduct. To restore your account, you may provide a written statement detailing the improvements you plan to make. If your plan is approved by Apple and we confirm the changes have been made, your account may be restored.</p>
								<ul>
									<li id="5.6.1"><strong>5.6.1 App&nbsp;Store Reviews</strong>
										<p data-nr="">App&nbsp;Store customer reviews can be an integral part of the app experience, so you should treat customers with respect when responding to their comments. Keep your responses targeted to the user’s comments and do not include personal information, spam, or marketing in your response.</p>
										<p data-nr="">Use the provided API to prompt users to review your app; this functionality allows customers to provide an App&nbsp;Store rating and review without the inconvenience of leaving your app, and we will disallow custom review prompts.</p>
									</li>
									<li data-nr="" id="5.6.2"><strong>5.6.2<span><img src="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/images/key-icon.svg" height="17" alt="ASR &amp; NR"></span> Developer Identity</strong>
										<p data-nr="">Providing verifiable information to Apple and customers is critical to customer trust. Your representation of yourself, your business, and your offerings on the App&nbsp;Store or alternative app marketplaces must be accurate. The information you provide must be truthful, relevant, and up-to-date so that Apple and customers understand who they are engaging with and can contact you regarding any issues.</p>
									</li>
									<li id="5.6.3"><strong>5.6.3 Discovery Fraud</strong>
										<p data-nr="">Participating in the App&nbsp;Store requires integrity and a commitment to building and maintaining customer trust. Manipulating any element of the App&nbsp;Store customer experience such as charts, search, reviews, or referrals to your app erodes customer trust and is not permitted.</p>
									</li>
									<li id="5.6.4"><strong>5.6.4 App Quality</strong>
										<p data-nr="">Customers expect the highest quality from the App&nbsp;Store, and maintaining high quality content, services, and experiences promotes customer trust. Indications that this expectation is not being met include excessive customer reports about concerns with your app, such as negative customer reviews, and excessive refund requests. Inability to maintain high quality may be a factor in deciding whether a developer is abiding by the Developer Code of Conduct.</p>

						<h3 data-sidenav="" id="after-you-submit">After You Submit</h3>
						<p>Once you’ve submitted your app and metadata in App&nbsp;Store&nbsp;Connect and you’re in the review process, here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Timing</strong>: App&nbsp;Review will examine your app as soon as we can. However, if your app is complex or presents new issues, it may require greater scrutiny and consideration. And remember that if your app is repeatedly rejected for the same guideline violation or you’ve attempted to manipulate the review process, review of your app will take longer to complete. Learn more about <a href="https://developer.apple.com/distribute/app-review/">App Review</a>.</li>
							<li><strong>Status Updates</strong>: The current status of your app will be reflected in App&nbsp;Store&nbsp;Connect, so you can keep an eye on things from there.</li>
							<li><strong>Expedite Requests</strong>: If you have a critical timing issue, you can <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/?topic=expedite">request an expedited review<span></span></a>. Please respect your fellow developers by seeking expedited review only when you truly need it. If we find you’re abusing this system, we may reject your requests going forward.</li>
							<li><strong>Release Date</strong>: If your release date is set for the future, the app will not appear on the App&nbsp;Store until that date, even if it is approved by App&nbsp;Review. And remember that it can take up to 24-hours for your app to appear on all selected storefronts.</li>
							<li><strong>Rejections</strong>: Our goal is to apply these guidelines fairly and consistently, but nobody’s perfect. If your app has been rejected and you have questions or would like to provide additional information, please use App&nbsp;Store&nbsp;Connect to communicate directly with the App&nbsp;Review team. This may help get your app on the store, and it can help us improve the App&nbsp;Review process or identify a need for clarity in our policies.</li>
							<li><strong>Appeals</strong>: If you disagree with the outcome of your review, please <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/?topic=appeal">submit an appeal<span></span></a>. This may help get your app on the store. You may also <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/?topic=guideline">suggest changes to the guidelines<span></span></a> themselves to help us improve the App&nbsp;Review process or identify a need for clarity in our policies.</li>
							<li><strong>Bug Fix Submissions</strong>: For apps that are already on the App&nbsp;Store or an alternative app marketplace, bug fixes will not be delayed over guideline violations except for those related to legal or safety issues. If your app has been rejected, and qualifies for this process, please use App&nbsp;Store&nbsp;Connect to communicate directly with the App&nbsp;Review team indicating that you would like to take advantage of this process and plan to address the issue in your next submission.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>We’re excited to see what you come up with next!</p>

          <p>Being a model citizen and a person of taste, you probably don't <em>need</em> this reminder, but some others do: Federal judges do not like it when lawyers electronically watermark every page of their legal PDFs with a gigantic image—<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/dragon-lawyer-lawsuit.html">purchased for $20 online</a>—of a purple dragon wearing a suit and tie. Not even if your firm's name is "Dragon Lawyers."</p>
<p>Federal Magistrate Judge Ray Kent of the Western District of Michigan was unamused by a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.miwd.114988/gov.uscourts.miwd.114988.1.0.pdf">recent complaint</a> (PDF) that prominently featured the aubergine wyrm.</p>
<p>"Each page of plaintiff’s complaint appears on an e-filing which is dominated by a large multi-colored cartoon dragon dressed in a suit," he <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.miwd.114988/gov.uscourts.miwd.114988.6.0.pdf">wrote on April 28</a> (PDF). "Use of this dragon cartoon logo is not only distracting, it is juvenile and impertinent. The Court is not a cartoon."</p>
<p>Kent then ordered "that plaintiff shall not file any other documents with the cartoon dragon or other inappropriate content."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                <p>The original motivation for the creation of Bloom filters is efficient set
membership, using a probabilistic approach to significantly reduce the time and
space required to reject items that are not members in a certain set.</p>
<p>The data structure was proposed by Burton Bloom in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/362686.362692">a 1970 paper</a> titled "Space/Time
Trade-offs in Hash Coding with Allowable Errors". It's a good paper that's
worth reading.</p>
<div id="why-bloom-filters">

<p>Suppose that we store some information on disk and want to check if a certain
file contains a certain entry. Reading from disk is time consuming, so we want
to minimize it as much as possible. A Bloom filter is a data structure that
implements a cache with probabilistic properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the cache says the key is not present in a specific file, then it's
100% certain we should not be reading the file.</li>
<li>If the cache says the key <em>is</em> present in the file, there's a small chance
this is a false positive (and in fact the key isn't there). In this case
we just read the file as usual.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a scenario where the majority of queries "is this key in that file?" have a
negative answer, a Bloom filter can significantly speed up the system <a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>.
Moreover, the probabilistic nature (the existence of false positives) allows
Bloom filters to be extremely fast and occupy very little space. Here's a quote
from the Bloom paper:</p>
<blockquote>
The new hash-coding methods to be introduced are
suggested for applications in which the great majority of
messages to be tested will not belong to the given set. For
these applications, it is appropriate to consider as a unit of
time (called <em>reject time</em>) the average time required to
classify a test message as a nonmember of the given set.</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="how-a-bloom-filter-works">
<h2>How a Bloom filter works</h2>
<p>A Bloom filter is a special kind of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_addressing">hash table with open addressing</a>.
It's an array of bits (the length is typically denoted <em>m</em>), and some fixed
number (<em>k</em>) of hash functions. We'll assume each hash function can take an
arbitrary sequence of bytes and hash it into an integer in the inclusive range
<tt>[0, <span>m-1]</span></tt>. A Bloom filter supports two operations:</p>
<p><strong>Insert an item</strong>: the item is hashed using each of the <em>k</em> hash functions, and the
appropriate bits in the underlying array are set to 1.</p>
<p><strong>Test if an item is a member</strong>: the item is hashed using each of the <em>k</em> hash
functions. If any of the bits indicated by their results is 0, we return "false"
with certainty. If all the bits are 1, we return "true" - and there's a small
chance of false positives.</p>
<p>Here's how the Bloom paper describes it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hash area is considered as N individual addressable bits, with addresses 0
through N - 1. It is assumed that all bits in the hash area are first set to 0.</p>
<p>Next, each message in the set to be stored is hash coded into a number of
distinct bit addresses, say a1, a2, . . . , ad. Finally, all d bits addressed by
a1 through ad are set to 1.</p>
<p>To test a new message a sequence of d bit addresses,
say a'1, a'2, ... a'd, is generated in the same manner as for storing a message.
If all d bits are 1, the new message is accepted. If any of these bits is zero,
the message is rejected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully it's clear why this data structure is probabilistic in nature: it's
possible that different items hash to the same number, and therefore when
we test some X, all its hashes point to bits turned on by the hashing of other
data. Read the Math appendix for the math behind Bloom filters and how to
calculate (and design for a specific) the false positive rate.</p>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<p><img alt="Insertion into Bloom filter" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/2025/bloom-filter-insert.png"></p><ol>
<li>We start with an empty bloom filter with <tt>m=16</tt> and <tt>k=3</tt>. All bits
are initialized to 0.</li>
<li>Insertion of "x". The three hashes return indices 1, 6, 15, so these bits
in the array are set to 1.</li>
<li>Insertion of "y". Hashing returns indices 6, 9 and 13, so these
bits in the array are set to 1. Note that bit 6 is set for both "x" and "y",
and that's fine.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, let's look at some membership tests:</p>
<p><img alt="Membership test in a Bloom filter" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/2025/bloom-filter-test.png"></p><ol start="4">
<li>Test "x". Hashing returns 1, 6, 15; all these bits are 1 in the
array, so the answer is "true". This is a true positive.</li>
<li>Test "w". Hashing returns 3, 9, 13. Since the bit at position 3 is 0, the
answer is "false".</li>
<li>Test "v". Hashing returns 9, 13, 15; all these bits are 1 in the array,
so the answer is "true". This is a false positive.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that it's trivial to prove (by the law of contraposition) that all "false"
answers from a Bloom filter's test operation are true negatives.</p>

<p>You'll have to read the Math appendix to understand how it works.</p>
</div>
<div id="practicalities">
<h2>Practicalities</h2>
<p>Let's look at a practical example of a realistic Bloom filter and how it
performs. Suppose we want to store about 1 billion items, and have a false
positive rate of 1% (meaning that if the filter returns "true" for a test,
there's a 99% chance that the item was previously added to the filter).
Using these requirements, we can invoke <tt>CalculateParams</tt> to get the Bloom
filter parameters:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>CalculateParams(1000000000, 0.01) ===&gt; (9585058378 7)
</pre></div>
<p>This means <em>m</em> is about 9.6 billion (bits) and <em>k</em> is 7. In other words, our
Bloom filter requires about 1.2 GB of space to cache the membership test of
a billion items (that could be of arbitrary size). Moreover, the lookup is
very fast - it's just 7 applications of the hash function. The constant lookup
cost is particularly attractive, as it doesn't depend on the number of items
actually inserted, or on any particular pattern in the data (i.e. there are
no worst case scenarios with asymptotically higher cost).</p>
<p>On my machine, benchmarking with the Go implementation shown above I get ~80
<em>nanoseconds</em> per lookup. Mind you, this is the simplest Go implementation I
could think of - nothing here is optimized; I'm sure this can be improved at
least 2x by using a more speed-optimized hash implementation, for example.</p>
<p>Now imagine how long it would take to ascertain if data is present in a file
with 1 billion entries, even if the file contains proper indexing for fast
lookups. Just asking the OS to read the file's first few KiBs to get at the
index would take orders of magnitude longer than 30 ns.</p>
<p>Recall that Bloom filters are best suited for cases "in which the great majority
of messages to be tested will not belong to the given set". Moreover, even if
the data exists in the file, false positives only happen 1% of the time.
Therefore, the number of times we'll have to go to the disk just to find the
data is not there is a very small fraction of total accesses.</p>

<div id="appendix-the-math-behind-bloom-filters">
<h2>Appendix: the Math behind Bloom filters</h2>
<p>A reminder on notation:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>m</em>: size (in bits) of the set</li>
<li><em>n</em>: how many keys were inserted into the filter</li>
<li><em>k</em>: number of hash functions used to insert/test each key</li>
</ul>
<p>For a specific bit in the set, assuming our hash functions distribute
the keys randomly, the probability of it not being set by a specific
hash function is:</p>
<p>And the probability it’s not set by either of our <em>k</em> hash functions is:</p>
<p>The last formula is constructed to use an approximation of 
for a large enough <em>m</em> (see the <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2022/derivative-of-the-exponential-function/">appendix in this post</a>) to write:</p>
<p>After inserting <em>n</em> elements, the probability that it’s 0 is:</p>
<p>Meaning that the probability of it being 1 is:</p>
<p>Recap: this is the probability of any given bit being 1 after <em>n</em> bits
were inserted into a set of size <em>m</em> with <em>k</em> different hash functions.</p>
<p>Assuming independence between our hash functions (this is not super
rigorous, but a reasonable assumption in practice), let’s calculate the
false positive rate. Suppose we have a new key that’s not in the set,
and we’re trying to check its membership by hashing it with our <em>k</em> hash
functions. The false positive rate is the probability that all hashes
land on a bit that’s already set to 1:</p>
<p>This is also called the <em>error rate</em> of our filter, or
. To get an optimal (minimal) false positive rate,
let’s minimize . Since the logarithm function is
monotonically increasing, it will be more convenient to minimize
:</p>
<p>We’ll calculate the derivative w.r.t. <em>k</em> and set it to 0:</p>
<p>Substituting a variable  and using some more
calculus and algebra, we can find that:</p>
<p>A numerical example: if we have a set with 1 million bits, and we expect
to insert about 100,000 elements, the optimal number of hash functions
is:</p>
<p>However, it’s more useful to aim for a certain error rate, and set the
filter parameters accordingly. Let’s assume we’ll be using this optimal
value of <em>k</em>. Substituting  into the
equation for  from above:</p>
<p>If we use the numerical example from before with ,
the error rate with an optimal <em>k</em> will be
.</p>
<p>What often happens is that we have an error rate in mind and we want to
calculate how many bits per element we want to dedicate in our set.
Let’s take the previous equation and try to isolate 
from it using a logarithm:</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<p>Final numerical example: suppose we want an error (false positive) rate
of 1%. This means our set should have:</p>
<p>... bits per element. So if we expect about 100,000 elements, the bit
set used for our filter should have at least 958,000 bits. And, as
calculated earlier, we should be using  hash functions to
achieve this optimal error rate.</p>

<section id="abstract">

Third-party (<abbr title="also known as">AKA</abbr> cross-site) cookies are harmful to the web, and must be removed from the web platform. This finding explains why they must be removed, and examines the challenges in removing them. We highlight some use cases that depend on third-party cookies and offer some examples of designed-for-purpose technologies that can replace them. Specification authors are expected to ensure they do not undermine the benefits of removing third-party cookies when proposing new web platform technologies.

</section>

<section id="sotd">
This document is an agreed finding and reflects the consensus of the <abbr title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</abbr>.
</section>

## Introduction

We consider privacy a core design principle and differentiator for the web platform (see: [Ethical Web Principles](https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/#privacy), [Unsanctioned Web Tracking](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/unsanctioned-tracking/), [Private Browsing Modes](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/private-browsing-modes/), [Privacy Principles](https://www.w3.org/TR/privacy-principles/), [Security &amp; Privacy Questionnaire](https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/)).

Many browsers have restricted third-party cookies (see: [Webkit](https://webkit.org/blog/10218/full-third-party-cookie-blocking-and-more/), [Mozilla](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/firefox-rolls-out-total-cookie-protection-by-default-to-all-users-worldwide/)). Unfortunately, [not all browsers have followed suit](https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en_us/news/privacy-sandbox-update/). The TAG calls for all browsers to drop support for third-party cookies, as this provides an opportunity to further improve the privacy preserving features of the web platform.

Removing third-party cookies from the web platform is not without complications. There are use cases for third-party cookies that need to be preserved, and pitfalls we need to be careful to avoid while doing so. This document sets out some aspects that specification editors and implementors should be aware of in order to make sure we ultimately [leave the web better than we found it](https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/#leave-the-web-better) after third-party cookies are removed.

## Why remove third party cookies?

Cookies were [originally designed](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2109.html) for recognizing repeat visitors to a website, but they were soon repurposed for use cases like: login and single sign-on; tracking state (like putting shopping choices into a cart); tracking to better target advertising; detecting fraud; measurement and attribution of ad clicks. Third party cookies (cookies set by someone other than the website being used) have introduced additional vectors for cookies to be used as a data collection mechanism across web sites. This increase in data collection and sharing about people using the web - often in a way that is opaque or incomprehensible to a web user - results in decreased individual and collective privacy.

[Third-party cookies](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-11#name-third-party-cookies) in particular are a key technology supporting tracking networks, which have been [identified as a major threat to privacy](https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis.html#name-privacy-considerations). These tracking networks entail concentrating data in the hands of - and thus giving greater power to - intermediaries with a presence across many sites, away from the individual sites a person is actually visiting. This centralizing effect has repercussions on innovation and accountability, beyond what is in scope for discussion here.

We maintain that [security and privacy are essential](https://w3ctag.github.io/ethical-web-principles/#privacy) on the web; a reduction in privacy also has implications for [freedom of expression](https://w3ctag.github.io/ethical-web-principles/#expression), [supporting healthy communities](https://w3ctag.github.io/ethical-web-principles/#community) and the [enhancement of individual control and power](https://w3ctag.github.io/ethical-web-principles/#control).

## Use cases previously met by third-party cookies

Some features of the web that people have come to expect, and which greatly improve user experience, currently depend on third-party cookies. Continuing to support these use cases is important. It is better to approach this with replacement technologies that are designed-for-purpose and built to respect user privacy. Any proposal that acts as a general-purpose replacement for third-party cookies would need to be accompanied by evidence that it does not recreate the same issues.

Some of the use cases that are important enough to justify the creation of purpose-specific solutions include federated identity, authorizing access to cross-site resources, and fraud mitigation. There is also active investigation of cross-site information in advertising, for both measurement and targeting purposes.

In all cases, it is important to continually review how such proposals might interact with other emerging or proposed APIs. Be aware that a set of new technologies which carry minimal risk individually, could be used in combination for tracking or profiling of web users.

## Leaving the web better than we found it

We support removing third-party cookies from the web platform, and we embrace the opportunity to improve the privacy features of the web. When we review new technologies to replace third-party cookies, we need to ensure that the replacements do not recreate the same pitfalls to privacy.

The TAG considers each new technology proposal *both* individually, *and* as they fit together with the web platform as a whole. The web must be cross-platform, so multi-implementer (multi-browser) support and developer support for privacy-related specifications is essential if they are going to achieve the goal of increasing privacy on the web. When we consider whether something makes the web platform better, we should be explicit about what the baseline for comparison is. Is a proposal better for privacy when compared to usage of third-party cookies? Or when compared with a web free from third-party cookies altogether? What about when some user agents restrict third-party cookies, but others do not?

Many varied proposals are being incubated in W3C Community Groups (e.g., [PATCG](https://patcg.github.io/), [Privacy CG](https://github.com/privacycg/), [WICG](https://wicg.io/)) as well as outside (e.g., [Privacy Sandbox](https://www.privacysandbox.com/)), and in these incubation stages multi-stakeholder support, consensus, and possible timelines for standardization are uncertain, and far from guaranteed.

We want to emphasize that as any replacement proposals progress, implementations should have a strong commitment toward, and reasonable time frame for, removing third-party cookies.

We are also wary of new mechanisms being introduced that could be abused together with cookies, fingerprinting surface or other tools, for greater privacy invasion.
Given this context, we see an urgency to have a strict timeline for the removal of third-party cookies.

All proposers of new web platform technologies are expected to be able to explain and justify the benefits and trade-offs of their proposal. It is particularly important that proposals which aim to fill gaps left by the removal of third-party cookies provide clear and concrete evidence that individual and collective privacy is still preserved; especially proposals which involve profiling, cross-context recognition, or otherwise aggregating or sharing of web user data between parties. We encourage that proposals claiming to improve privacy on the web platform undergo independent review and analysis; the burden of proof is on the proposers, not reviewers, to justify additions and changes to the web platform. The benefits to web platform users of the removal of third-party cookies must not be undermined by user agents or site authors in other ways.

We are strongly in favor of innovations to build sustainable business models on the web platform, but an in-depth discussion of the various possibilities are outside of the scope of this document. From an architectural standpoint, web standards should avoid encoding particular business models that are available to authors, publishers, and web content creators.

In conclusion, when accommodating changes caused by the removal of third-party cookies, we should avoid introducing new technologies that, when deployed either individually or in combination, effectively preserve the status quo of harmful tracking and surveillance on the web.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>An employee at Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company <strong>xAI</strong>&nbsp;leaked a private key on <strong>GitHub</strong> that for the past two months could have allowed anyone to query private xAI large language models (LLMs) which appear to have been custom made for working with internal data from Musk’s companies, including <strong>SpaceX</strong>, <strong>Tesla</strong> and <strong>Twitter/X, </strong>KrebsOnSecurity has learned.</p>
<div id="attachment_71170"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71170" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/x-ai.png" alt="" width="748" height="497"></p><p id="caption-attachment-71170">Image: Shutterstock, @sdx15.</p></div>
<p><strong>Philippe Caturegli</strong>, “chief hacking officer” at the security consultancy <strong>Seralys</strong>, was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/caturegli_yo-xai-your-devs-are-leaking-api-keys-on-activity-7321566948020953088-6KXj?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAliaMB3BQO-WOS-eUh-XU4HAd5h8pTzkI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first to publicize the leak</a> of credentials for an x.ai application programming interface (API) exposed in the GitHub code repository of a technical staff member at xAI.</p>
<p>Caturegli’s post on LinkedIn caught the attention of researchers at <strong>GitGuardian</strong>, a company that specializes in detecting and remediating exposed secrets in public and proprietary environments. GitGuardian’s systems constantly scan GitHub and other code repositories for exposed API keys, and fire off automated alerts to affected users.</p>
<p>GitGuardian’s <strong>Eric Fourrier</strong> told KrebsOnSecurity the exposed API key had access to several unreleased models of <strong>Grok</strong>, the AI chatbot developed by xAI. In total, GitGuardian found the key had access to at least 60 fine-tuned and private LLMs.</p>
<p>“The credentials can be used to access the X.ai API with the identity of the user,” GitGuardian wrote in an email explaining their findings to xAI. “The associated account not only has access to public Grok models (grok-2-1212, etc) but also to what appears to be unreleased (grok-2.5V), development (research-grok-2p5v-1018), and private models (tweet-rejector, grok-spacex-2024-11-04).”</p>
<p>Fourrier found GitGuardian had alerted the xAI employee about the exposed API key nearly two months ago — on March 2. But as of April 30, when GitGuardian directly alerted xAI’s security team to the exposure, the key was still valid and usable. xAI told GitGuardian to report the matter through its bug bounty program at <strong>HackerOne</strong>, but just a few hours later the repository containing the API key was removed from GitHub.</p>
<p>“It looks like some of these internal LLMs were fine-tuned on SpaceX data, and some were fine-tuned with Tesla data,” Fourrier said. “I definitely don’t think a Grok model that’s fine-tuned on SpaceX data is intended to be exposed publicly.”</p>
<p>xAI did not respond to a request for comment. Nor did the 28-year-old xAI technical staff member whose key was exposed.<span id="more-71165"></span></p>
<p><strong>Carole Winqwist</strong>, chief marketing officer at GitGuardian, said giving potentially hostile users free access to private LLMs is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>“If you’re an attacker and you have direct access to the model and the back end interface for things like Grok, it’s definitely something you can use for further attacking,” she said. “An attacker could it use for prompt injection, to tweak the (LLM) model to serve their purposes, or try to implant code into the supply chain.”</p>
<p>The inadvertent exposure of internal LLMs for xAI comes as Musk’s so-called <strong>Department of Government Efficiency</strong> (DOGE) has been feeding sensitive government records into artificial intelligence tools. In February, <strong>The Washington Post</strong> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> DOGE officials were feeding data from across the Education Department into AI tools to probe the agency’s programs and spending.</p>
<p>The Post said DOGE plans to replicate this process across many departments and agencies, accessing the back-end software at different parts of the government and then using AI technology to extract and sift through information about spending on employees and programs.</p>
<p>“Feeding sensitive data into AI software puts it into the possession of a system’s operator, increasing the chances it will be leaked or swept up in cyberattacks,” Post reporters wrote.</p>
<p>Wired reported in March that DOGE has <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gsai-chatbot-1500-federal-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deployed a proprietary chatbot called GSAi</a> to 1,500 federal workers at the <strong>General Services Administration</strong>, part of an effort to automate tasks previously done by humans as DOGE continues its purge of the federal workforce.</p>
<p>A <strong>Reuters</strong> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/musks-doge-using-ai-snoop-us-federal-workers-sources-say-2025-04-08/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> last month said Trump administration officials told some U.S. government employees that DOGE is using AI to surveil at least one federal agency’s communications for hostility to President Trump and his agenda. Reuters wrote that the DOGE team has heavily deployed Musk’s Grok AI chatbot as part of their work slashing the federal government, although Reuters said it could not establish exactly how Grok was being used.</p>
<p>Caturegli said while there is no indication that federal government or user data could be accessed through the exposed x.ai API key, these private models are likely trained on proprietary data and may unintentionally expose details related to internal development efforts at xAI, Twitter, or SpaceX.</p>
<p>“The fact that this key was publicly exposed for two months and granted access to internal models is concerning,” Caturegli said. “This kind of long-lived credential exposure highlights weak key management and insufficient internal monitoring, raising questions about safeguards around developer access and broader operational security.”</p>

				<p>One part of my work for the ScummVM project is helping to keep the server infrastructure up and running, including our primary server, which hosts our website, wiki, forums, and some internal applications.</p>
<p>About three weeks ago, I started receiving monitoring notifications indicating an increased load on the MariaDB server. This in itself is nothing too unusual. It usually means nothing but a sudden influx of new visitors, and in most cases, it is just a link being shared somewhere or a single IP trying to annoy us.</p>
<p>The notifications popped up and disappeared as quickly as they appeared. I started to look into the log files of our web server, and I didn’t notice anything too unusual, maybe a bit more background noise. This went on for a couple of days without seriously impacting our server or accessibility–it was a tad slower than usual.</p>
<p>And then the website went down.</p>
<p>We use a stack consisting of Apache2, PHP-FPM, and MariaDB to host the web applications. The server logs revealed that everything was saturated. Apache2 refused to accept new connections, the PHP-FPM pools were completely filled, and MariaDB also had no connections left.</p>
<p>Now, it was time to find out what was going on. Hoping that it was just one single IP trying to annoy us, I opened the access log of the day and was greeted by this:</p>

</code></pre><p>For privacy reasons, I replaced the real IPs with 127.0.0.1, but trust me, there were many IPs–around 35.000, to be precise–from residential networks all over the world. At this scale, it makes no sense to even consider blocking individual IPs, subnets, or entire networks. Due to the open nature of the project, geo-blocking isn’t an option either.</p>
<p>The main problem is time. The URLs accessed in the attack are the most expensive ones the wiki offers since they heavily depend on the database and are highly dynamic, requiring some processing time in PHP. This is the worst-case scenario since it throws the server into a death spiral.</p>
<p>First, the database starts to lag or even refuse new connections. This, combined with the steadily increasing server load, leads to slower PHP execution. Eventually, all resources in the PHP-FPM pools are used up, and since Apache2 doesn’t get a reply from PHP-FPM in time, it waits until it runs out of free connections. At this point, the website dies. Restarting the stack immediately solves the problem for a couple of minutes at best until the server starves again.</p>
<p>To bring the website back up, I cranked up the configuration of our stack to insane values, risking that the server would eventually run out of memory.</p>
<p>I needed a proper solution, something that takes the load away from the web application stack.</p>
<h2 id="hi-anubis">Hi, Anubis!</h2>
<p><a href="https://anubis.techaro.lol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anubis</a>
 is a program that checks incoming connections, processes them, and only forwards “good” connections to the web application. To do so, Anubis sits between the server or proxy responsible for accepting HTTP/HTTPS and the server that provides the application.</p>
<p>Designed to protect websites from AI scraper bots, Anubis primarily focuses on parameters like the user agent sent with the request and looks for oddities in the connection. “Known good” and harmless clients are always accepted, and “Known bad” clients are always denied. In case the defaults are not working for your application, Anubis allows extensive configuration with customizable <a href="https://anubis.techaro.lol/docs/admin/policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bot policy definitions</a>
.</p>
<p>And then, there’s the in-between, the part where the real magic happens. Many bots disguise themselves as standard browsers to circumvent filtering based on the user agent. So, if something claims to be a browser, it should behave like one, right? To verify this, Anubis presents a <a href="https://anubis.techaro.lol/docs/design/why-proof-of-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proof-of-work challenge</a>
 that the browser needs to solve. If the challenge passes, it forwards the incoming request to the web application protected by Anubis; otherwise, the request is denied.</p>
<p><em>Solving</em> the challenge–which is valid for one week once passed–takes a couple of seconds on the client side, occupying CPU time. <em>Checking</em> if the browser solved the very fast on the server side, taking up virtually no resources.</p>

<p>As a regular user, all you’ll notice is a loading screen when accessing the website. As an attacker with stupid bots, you’ll never get through. As an attacker with clever bots, you’ll end up exhausting your own resources. As an AI company trying to scrape the website, you’ll quickly notice that CPU time can be expensive if used on a large scale.</p>
<p>Long story short, deploying Anubis immediately solved our issues. In fact, you can see the exact time in our monitoring.</p>

  <figcaption>Monitoring showing the drop in MariaDB usage after deploying Anubis</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>I didn’t get a single notification afterward. The server load has never been lower. The attack itself is still ongoing at the time of writing this article. To me, Anubis is not only a blocker for AI scrapers. Anubis is a DDoS protection.</p>

<p>The future of <a href="https://deno.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Deno Land Inc.</a> is not looking bright. Their commercial product <a href="https://deno.com/deploy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Deno Deploy</a> claims to be “edge” hosting with “massive global scale”.</p><blockquote><p>JavaScript applications on Deno Deploy run server-side logic geographically close to users, offering low latency and great performance.</p></blockquote><p>Except that’s <em>a bit of a stretch</em> if we’re being honest.</p><p>Deno provide a <a href="https://docs.deno.com/deploy/manual/regions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">list of regions</a> in their documentation (take a peek if you want spoilers). Between ’23–2024 I gave Deno Deploy a fair shot but my <a href="https://dbushell.com/notes/2024-09-03T05:44Z/">personal experience</a> was negative. I left <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deploy_feedback/issues/505" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">feedback amongst others’</a> and moved on.</p><p>Well, I did keep an eye on one thing…</p><h2 id="serverless-anyone">Serverless, anyone?</h2><p>Back in <a href="https://github.com/denoland/docs/commit/6d7d022ffa14595a23450bb7370743cd821b1958" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">January 2024</a> a few people noted that Deno Deploy had dropped from 35 regions to <strong>just twelve (12)</strong> worldwide.</p><blockquote><p>For example, Seoul moved to Tokyo, response times went from 8ms to 42ms!</p><p><cite><a href="https://x.com/Elefunc/status/1750442433144647933" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@Elefunc on <del>Twitter</del></a></cite></p></blockquote><p>I would have been happy seeing 42ms to begin with. Anyway, the original 35 wasn’t impressive but twelve is frankly pitiful if I’m being brutally honest, which I am (because it gets worse). I’ve never quite understand what “serverless” means but I think Deno are taking it too literally.</p><p>To provide an unfair comparison, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cloudflare</a> boast “335 cities in 125+ countries”. I don’t know what a respectable number is for Deno Deploy. Only that it’s between 12 and 335 but I suspect we’ll never find out.</p><p><a href="https://bunny.net/network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bunny</a> advertise 119 Point of Presences (PoPs) in 77 countries.

Now I’m curious, if (big if) Enterprise Deno is doing well, why scale back for us mortals?</p><p>By <a href="https://github.com/denoland/docs/commit/26786eb3fd07d908d5bf650f0166b2d104158d31" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">December 2024</a> Deno Deploy dropped from twelve to <strong>seven (7)</strong> regions.

To help foster a safer, more secure environment for everyone, we will also open source our ZKP technology to other wallets and online services.</p><h2 data-block-key="8cckk">Google Wallet will launch in 50 more countries</h2><p data-block-key="fm0d2">We're also expanding Google Wallet to 50 more countries, allowing users to view and use digital passes in the app and on the <a href="https://wallet.google.com/wallet/home?utm_source=marketing&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=keyword_042825">web</a>.

<p dir="auto"><strong>Kubetail</strong> is a general-purpose logging dashboard for Kubernetes, optimized for tailing logs across across multi-container workloads in real-time. With Kubetail, you can view logs from all the containers in a workload (e.g. Deployment or DaemonSet) merged into a single, chronological timeline, delivered to your browser or terminal.</p>
<p dir="auto">The primary entry point for Kubetail is the <code>kubetail</code> CLI tool, which can launch a local web dashboard on your desktop or stream raw logs directly to your terminal. Behind the scenes, Kubetail uses your cluster's Kubernetes API to fetch logs directly from your cluster, so it works out of the box without needing to forward your logs to an external service first. Kubetail also uses your Kubernetes API to track container lifecycle events in order to keep your log timeline in sync as containers start, stop or get replaced. This makes it easy to follow logs seamlessly as user requests move from one ephemeral container to another across services.</p>
<p dir="auto">Our goal is to build the most powerful, user-friendly logging platform for Kubernetes and we'd love your input. If you notice a bug or have a suggestion please create a GitHub Issue or send us an email (<a href="mailto:hello@kubetail.com">hello@kubetail.com</a>)!</p>

Our team was small (~23
employees), and we knew that we needed many more people to execute on our
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikn7ovpjdIg">audacious vision</a>.  While we had
had success hiring in our personal networks, those networks now felt tapped;
we needed to get further afield.  As is our wont, we got together as a team
and brainstormed: how could we get a bigger and broader applicant pool?  One
of our engineers, Sean, shared some personal experience: that
<a href="https://oxide.computer/principles">Oxide’s principles and values</a> were very
personally important to him — but that when he explained them to people
unfamiliar with the company, they were (understandably?) dismissed as
corporate claptrap.  Sean had found, however, that there was one surefire way
to cut through the skepticism:  to explain our approach to compensation.
Maybe, Sean wondered, we should talk about it publicly?</p><p>"I could certainly write a blog entry explaining it," I offered.  At this
suggestion, the team practically lunged with enthusiasm: the reaction was so
uniformly positive that I have to assume that everyone was sick of explaining
this most idiosyncratic aspect of Oxide to friends and family.  So what was
the big deal about our compensation?  Well, as a I wrote in the resulting
piece,
<a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values">Compensation
as a Reflection of Values</a>, our compensation is not merely transparent, but
uniform.  The piece — unsurprisingly, given the evergreen hot topic that is
compensation — got a ton of attention.  While some of that attention was
negative (despite the piece trying to frontrun every HN hater!), much of it was
positive — and everyone seemed to be at least intrigued.</p><p>And in terms of its initial purpose, the piece succeeded beyond our wildest
imagination: it brought a surge of new folks interested in the company.  Best
of all, the people new to Oxide were interested for all of the right reasons:
not the compensation <em>per se</em>, but for the values that the compensation
represents.  The deeper they dug, the more they found to like — and many who
learned about Oxide for the first time through that blog entry we now count as
long-time, cherished colleagues.</p><p>That blog entry was a long time ago now, and today we have ~75 employees
(and a <a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/the-cloud-computer">shipping product</a>!);
how is our compensation model working out for us?</p></div></div><div><h2 data-sectnum=""><a href="#_how_its_going">How it’s going<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" role="img"><g fill="currentColor"><path d="m6.586 12.243 1.59-1.591a.75.75 0 0 1 1.061 0l.354.353a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06L8 13.658A4 4 0 0 1 2.343 8l1.591-1.591a.75.75 0 0 1 1.06 0l.354.354a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-1.59 1.591a2 2 0 1 0 2.828 2.829M12.066 9.591a.75.75 0 0 1-1.06 0l-.354-.354a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l1.59-1.591a2 2 0 1 0-2.828-2.829l-1.59 1.591a.75.75 0 0 1-1.061 0l-.354-.353a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06L8 2.342A4 4 0 0 1 13.657 8z"></path><path d="M9.945 5.702a.75.75 0 0 0-1.061 0L5.702 8.884a.75.75 0 0 0 0 1.06l.353.354a.75.75 0 0 0 1.061 0l3.182-3.182a.75.75 0 0 0 0-1.06z"></path></g></svg></a></h2><div><p>Before we get into our deeper findings, two updates that are so important that
we have updated the blog entry itself.  First, the dollar figure itself
continues to increase over time (as of this writing in 2025, $207,264);
things definitely haven’t gotten (and aren’t
getting!) any cheaper.  And second, we <em>did</em> introduce variable compensation for
some sales roles.  Yes, those roles can make more than the rest of us — but
they can also make less, too.  And, importantly:  if/when those folks are
making more than the rest of us, it’s because they’re selling a lot — a
result that can be celebrated by everyone!</p><p>Those critical updates out of the way, how is it working?  There have been a
lot of surprises along the way, mostly (all?) of the positive variety.  A
couple of things that we have learned:</p><p><strong>People take their own performance really seriously.</strong>  When some outsiders
hear about our compensation model, they insist that it can’t possibly work
because "everyone will slack off." I have come to find this concern to be more
revealing of the person making the objection than of our model, as our
experience has been in fact the opposite: in my one-on-one conversations with
team members, a frequent subject of conversation is people who are concerned
that they aren’t doing enough (or that they aren’t doing the right thing, or
that their work is progressing slower than they would like).  I find my job is
often to help quiet this inner critic while at the same time stoking what I
feel is a healthy urge:  when one holds one’s colleagues in high regard, there
is an especially strong desire to help contribute — to prove oneself worthy
of a superlative team.  Our model allows people to focus on their own
contribution (whatever it might be).</p><p><strong>People take hiring <em>really</em> seriously.</strong>  When evaluating a peer (rather
than a subordinate), one naturally has high expectations — and because (in
the sense of our wages, anyway) everyone at Oxide is a peer, it shouldn’t be
surprising that folks have very high expectations for potential future
colleagues.  And because the
<a href="https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/3">Oxide hiring process</a> is writing
intensive, it allows for candidates to be thoroughly reviewed by Oxide
employees — who are tough graders!  It is, bluntly, really hard to get
a job at Oxide.</p><p><strong>It allows us to internalize the importance of different roles.</strong>  One of the
more incredible (and disturbingly frequent) objections I have heard is: "But
is that what you’ll pay support folks?" I continue to find this question
offensive, but I no longer find it surprising: the specific dismissal of
support roles reveals a widespread and corrosive devaluation of those closest
to customers. My rejoinder is simple: think of the best support engineers
you’ve worked with; what were they worth? Anyone who has shipped complex
systems knows these extraordinary people — calm under fire, deeply technical,
brilliantly resourceful, profoundly empathetic — are invaluable to the
business. So what if you built a team entirely of folks like that? The
response has usually been: well, sure, if you’re going to only hire <em>those</em>
folks. Yeah, we are — and we have!</p><p><strong>It allows for fearless versatility.</strong> A bit of a corollary to the
above, but subtly different: even though we (certainly!) hire and select for
certain roles, our uniform compensation means we can in fact think primarily
in terms of <em>people</em> unconfined by those roles.  That is, we can be very fluid
about what we’re working on, without fear of how it will affect a perceived
career trajectory.  As a concrete example: we had a large customer that wanted
to put in place a program for some of the additional work they wanted to see
in the product.  The complexity of their needs required dedicated program
management resources that we couldn’t spare, and in another more static
company we would have perhaps looked to hire.  But in our case, two folks came
together — CJ from operations, and Izzy from support — and did something
together that was in some regards new to both of them (and was neither of
their putative full-time jobs!)  The result was indisputably successful:  the
customer loved the results, and two terrific people got a chance to work
closely together without worrying about who was dotted-lined to whom.</p><p><strong>It has allowed us to organizationally scale.</strong> Many organizations describe
themselves as flat, and a reasonable rebuttal to this are the "shadow
hierarchies" created by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tyranny_of_Structurelessness">tyranny of
structurelessness</a>.  And indeed, if one were to read (say)

(in)famous handbook</a>, the autonomy seems great — but the stack ranking
decidedly less so, especially because the handbook is conspicuously silent on
the subject of compensation.  (Unsurprisingly,
<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ex-valve-employee-describes-ruthless-industry-politics/">compensation
was weaponized at Valve</a>, which descended into
<a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/07/wireduk-valve-jeri-ellsworth/">toxic
cliquishness</a>.) While we believe that autonomy <em>is</em> important to do one’s best
work, we also have a clear structure at Oxide in that Steve Tuck (Oxide
co-founder and CEO) is
in charge.  He has to be:  he is held accountable to our investors — and he
must have the latitude to make decisions.  Under Steve, it is true that
we <em>don’t</em> have layers of middle management.  Might we need some in the
future?  Perhaps, but what fraction of middle management in a company is
dedicated to — at some level — determining who gets what in terms of
compensation?  What happens when you eliminate that burden completely?</p><p><strong>It frees us to both lead and follow.</strong> We expect that
every Oxide employee has the capacity to lead others — and we tap this
capacity frequently.  Of course, a company in which everyone is trying to
direct all traffic all the time would be a madhouse, so we also very much rely
on following one another too!  Just as our compensation model allows us to
internalize the values of different roles, it allows us to appreciate the
value of <strong>both</strong> leading and following, and empowers us each with the judgement
to know when to do which.  This isn’t always easy or free of ambiguity, but
this particular dimension of our versatility has been essential — and
our compensation model serves to encourage it.</p><p><strong>It causes us to hire carefully and deliberately.</strong> Of course, one should
<em>always</em> hire carefully and deliberately, but this often isn’t the case — and
many a startup has been ruined by reckless expansion of headcount.  One of the
roots of this can be found in a dirty open secret of Silicon Valley middle
management: its ranks are taught to grade their career by the number of
reports in their organization.  Just as if you were to compensate software
engineers based on the number of lines of code they wrote, this results in
perverse incentives and predictable disasters — and any Silicon Valley vet
will have plenty of horror stories of middle management jockeying for reqs or
reorgs when they should have been focusing on product and customers.  When
you can eliminate middle management, you eliminate this incentive.  We grow
the team not because of someone’s animal urges to have the largest possible
organization, but rather because we are at a point where adding people will
allow us to better serve our market and customers.</p><p><strong>It liberates feedback from compensation.</strong> Feedback is, of course, very
important:  we all want to know when and where we’re doing the right thing!
And of course, we want to know too where there is opportunity for improvement.
However, Silicon Valley has historically tied feedback so tightly to
compensation that it has ceased to even pretend to be constructive:  if it
needs to be said, performance review processes aren’t, in fact, about
improving the performance of the team, but rather quantifying and
stack-ranking that performance for purposes of compensation.  When
compensation is moved aside, there is a kind of liberation for feedback
itself:  because feedback is now entirely earnest, it can be expressed and
received thoughtfully.</p><p><strong>It allows people to focus on doing the right thing.</strong>  In a world of
traditional, compensation-tied performance review, the organizational priority
is around those things that affect compensation — even at the expense of
activity that clearly benefits the company.  This leads to all sorts of wild
phenomena, and most technology workers will be able to tell stories of doing
things that we’re clearly right for the company, but having to hide it from
management that thought only narrowly in terms of their own stated KPIs and
MBOs.  By contrast, over and over (and over!) again, we have found that people
do the right thing at Oxide — even if (especially if?) no one is looking.
The beneficiary of that right thing?  More often than not, it’s our customers,
who have uniformly praised the team for going above and beyond.</p><p><strong>It allows us to focus on the work that matters.</strong>  Relatedly, when
compensation is non-uniform, the process to figure out (and maintain) that
non-uniformity is laborious.  All of that work — of line workers assembling
packets explaining themselves, of managers arming themselves with those
packets to fight in the arena of organizational combat, and then of those same
packets ultimately being regurgitated back onto something called a review — is <em>work</em>. Assuming such a process is executed perfectly (something which I
suppose is possible in the abstract, even though I personally have never seen
it), this is work that does not in fact advance the mission of the company.
Not having variable compensation gives us all of that time and energy back to
do the <em>actual</em> work — the stuff that matters.</p><p><strong>It has stoked an extraordinary sense of teamwork.</strong> For me personally — and
as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAFD2bq1_tU&amp;t=2854s">I relayed on an episode
of <em>Software Misadventures</em></a> — the highlights of my career have been being a
part of an extraordinary team.  The currency of a team is mutual trust, and
while uniform compensation certainly isn’t the only way to achieve that trust,
boy does it ever help!  As Steve and I have told one another more times that
we can count:  we are so lucky to work on this team, with its extraordinary
depth and breadth.</p><p>While our findings have been very positive, I would still reiterate what we
said four years ago:  we don’t know what the future holds, and it’s easier to
make an unwavering commitment to the transparency rather than the uniformity.
That said, the uniformity has had so many positive ramifications that the model
feels more important than ever.  We are beyond the point of this being a
curiosity; it’s been essential for building a mission-focused team taking on
a problem larger than ourselves.  So it’s not a fit for everyone — but if
you are seeking an extraordinary team solving hard problems in service to
customers, <a href="https://oxide.computer/careers">consider Oxide</a>!</p></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span><span>Dangers come but dangers also go and when they do, the brain has an “all-clear” signal that teaches it to extinguish its fear. A new study in mice by MIT neuroscientists shows that the signal is the release of dopamine along a specific interregional brain circuit. The research therefore pinpoints a potentially critical mechanism of mental health, restoring calm when it works, but prolonging anxiety or even post-traumatic stress disorder when it doesn’t.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“Dopamine is essential to initiate fear extinction,” said Michele Pignatelli di Spinazzola, co-author of the new study from the lab of senior author <a href="https://picower.mit.edu/susumu-tonegawa">Susumu Tonegawa</a>, Picower Professor of biology and neuroscience at the RIKEN-MIT Laboratory for Neural Circuit Genetics in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and an HHMI Investigator.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In 2020 <a href="https://picower.mit.edu/news/these-neurons-extinguishing-fear-its-own-reward">Tonegawa’s lab showed</a> that learning to be afraid, and then learning when that’s no longer necessary, result from a competition between populations of cells in the brain’s amygdala region. When a mouse learns that a place is “dangerous” (because it gets a little foot shock there), the fear memory is encoded by neurons in the anterior of the basolateral amygdala (aBLA) that express the gene Rspo2. When the mouse then learns that a place is no longer associated with danger (because they wait there and the zap doesn’t recur), neurons in the posterior basolateral amygdala (pBLA) that express the gene Ppp1r1b encode a new fear extinction memory that overcomes the original dread. Notably those same neurons encode feelings of reward, helping to explain why it feels so good when we realize that an expected danger has dwindled.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In the new study, the lab, led by former members Xiangyu Zhang and Katelyn Flick, sought to determine what prompts these amygdala neurons to encode these memories. The rigorous set of experiments the team reports in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> show that it’s dopamine sent to the different amygdala populations from distinct groups of neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA).</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“Our study uncovers a precise mechanism by which dopamine helps the brain unlearn fear,” said Zhang, who also led the 2020 study and is now Senior Associate at Orbimed, a healthcare investment firm. “We found that dopamine activates specific amygdala neurons tied to reward, which in turn drive fear extinction. We now see that unlearning fear isn’t just about suppressing it—it’s a positive learning process powered by the brain’s reward machinery. This opens up new avenues for understanding and potentially treating fear-related disorders like PTSD.”</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Forgetting fear</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The VTA was the lab’s prime suspect to be the source of the signal because the region is well known for encoding surprising experiences and instructing the brain, with dopamine, to learn from them. The first set of experiments in the paper used multiple methods for tracing neural circuits to see whether and how cells in the VTA and the amygdala connect. They found a clear pattern: Rspo2 neurons were targeted by dopaminergic neurons in the anterior and left and right sides of the VTA. Ppp1r1b neurons received dopaminergic input from neurons in the center and posterior sections of the VTA. The density of connections was greater on the Ppp1r1b neurons than for the Rspo2 ones.</span></span></span></p>

<figure role="group">


<figcaption>An edited version of a figure from the research shows the ventral tegmental area, highlighting dopamine-associated neurons in green and one that connects to the posterior amygdala (magnified in inset) in red.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p><span><span><span>The circuit tracing showed that dopamine is available to amygdala neurons that encode fear and its extinction, but do those neurons care about dopamine? The team showed that indeed they express “D1” receptors for the neuromodulator. Commensurate with the degree of dopamine connectivity, Ppp1r1b cells had more receptors than Rspo2 neurons.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Dopamine does a lot of things, so the next question was whether its activity in the amygdala actually correlated with fear encoding and extinction. Using a method to track and visualize it in the brain, the team watched dopamine in the amygdala as mice underwent a three-day experiment. On day one they went to an enclosure where they experienced three little zaps on the feet. On day two they went back to the enclosure for 45 minutes where they didn’t experience any new shocks –at first the mice froze in fear but then relaxed after about 15 minutes. On day 3 they returned again to test whether they had indeed extinguished the fear they showed at the beginning of day 2.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The dopamine activity tracking revealed that during the shocks on day 1, Rspo2 neurons had the larger response to dopamine, but in the early moments of day 2 when the anticipated shocks didn’t come and the mice eased up on freezing in fear, the Ppp1r1b neurons showed the stronger dopamine activity. More strikingly, the mice that learned to extinguish their fear most strongly also showed the greatest dopamine signal at those neurons.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Causal connections</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The final sets of experiments sought to show that dopamine is not just available and associated with fear encoding and extinction, but also actually causes them. In one set, they turned to optogenetics, a technology that enables scientists to activate or quiet neurons with different colors of light. Sure enough, when they quieted VTA dopaminergic inputs in the pBLA, doing so impaired fear extinction. When they activated those inputs, it accelerated fear extinction. The researchers were surprised that when they activated VTA dopaminergic inputs into the aBLA they could reinstate fear even without any new foot shocks, impairing fear extinction.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The other way they confirmed a causal role for dopamine in fear encoding and extinction was to manipulate the amygdala neurons’ dopamine receptors. In Ppp1r1b neurons, overexpressing dopamine receptors impaired fear recall and promoted extinction, whereas knocking the receptors down impaired fear extinction. Meanwhile in the Rspo2 cells, knocking down receptors reduced the freezing behavior.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“We showed that fear extinction requires VTA dopaminergic activity in the pBLA Ppp1r1b neurons by using optogenetic inhibition of VTA terminals and cell-type-specific knockdown of D1 receptors in these neurons,” the authors wrote.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The scientists are careful in the study to note that while they’ve identified the “teaching signal” for fear extinction learning, the broader phenomenon of fear extinction occurs brainwide, rather than in just this single circuit.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>But the circuit seems to be a key node to consider as drug developers and psychiatrists work to combat anxiety and PTSD, Pignatelli di Spinazzola said.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“Fear learning and fear extinction provide a strong framework to study generalized anxiety and PTSD,” he said. “Our study investigates the underlying mechanisms suggesting multiple targets for a translational approach such as pBLA and use of dopaminergic modulation.”</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Marianna Rizzo is also a co-author of the study. Support for the research came from the RIKEN Center for Brain Science, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Freedom Together Foundation and The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.</span></span></span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>An Arizona woman who created a "laptop farm" in her home to help fake IT workers pose as US-based employees has pleaded guilty in a scheme that generated over $17 million for herself... and North Korea.</p>
<p>Christina Marie Chapman pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and conspiracy to launder monetary instruments in a US District Court on Tuesday.</p>
<p>She is scheduled to be sentenced on June 16, and under the terms of her plea deal, all parties will recommend the court put her behind bars for between 94 and 111 months. Chapman was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/17/three_arrested_for_helping_north_korea/">arrested</a> in May.</p>

    

<p>According to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/usao-dc/media/1352191/dl">court documents</a>, Chapman ran a laptop farm out of her home from October 2020 to October 2023. During this time she hosted computers for overseas IT workers — who were posing as American citizens and residents — to ensure the devices had local IP addresses, making them appear to be in the US.</p>

        


        

<p>Chapman also helped the foreign fraudsters steal the identities of more than 70 US nationals, then use those identities to apply for remote IT jobs, according to the Feds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who successfully obtained employment as part of the scam then received payroll checks at Chapman's home with direct deposits sent to her US bank accounts before ultimately being laundered and funneled to North Korea, and then potentially contributing to the DPRK's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/08/us_lazarus_group_crypto_seizure/">weapons programs</a>, the court document says.</p>

        

<p>It's unclear how much of the ill-gotten gains Chapman pocketed, but according to the Justice Department, Chapman's overseas IT workers received <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/arizona-woman-pleads-guilty-fraud-scheme-illegally-generated-17-million-revenue-north">more than $17.1 million</a> for their work. Much of the income was falsely reported to the IRS and Social Security Administration in the names of real US individuals whose identities had been stolen.</p>

</ul>
<p>Some of the overseas workers were hired at Fortune 500 companies, including a top-five television network, a premier Silicon Valley technology company, an aerospace and defense manufacturer, an American car manufacturer, a luxury retail chain, and a US-hallmark media and entertainment company.</p>
<p>The Norks specifically targeted some of these companies, likely for their sensitive IP and other valuable data in addition to providing a paycheck, and even "maintained postings for companies at which they wanted to insert IT workers," according to the DOJ.</p>
<p>In total, more than 300 US companies were scammed, and more than 70 people had false tax liabilities created in their name. Additionally, phony documents were submitted to the Department of Homeland Security on more than 100 occasions.</p>
<p>These types of scams have netted Pyongyang at least <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/13/doj_dpkr_fake_tech_worker_indictment/">$88 million</a> over six years. Earlier this week, <em>The Register</em> interviewed someone who was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/11/it_worker_scam/">twice targeted</a>. In both cases, the fraudsters used AI-based tools during video interviews with — wait for it — a security startup using AI to find vulnerabilities. ®</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/integrations">https://www.anthropic.com/news/integrations</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43859536">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Today we're announcing Integrations, a new way to connect your apps and tools to Claude. We're also expanding Claude's <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/research">Research</a> capabilities with an advanced mode that searches the web, your Google Workspace, and now your Integrations too. Claude can research for up to 45 minutes before delivering a comprehensive report, complete with citations. In addition to these updates, we're making web search available globally for all Claude users on paid plans.</p><h2 id="integrations">Integrations</h2><p>Last November, we launched the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol">Model Context Protocol</a> (MCP)—an open standard connecting AI apps to tools and data. Until now, support for MCP was limited to Claude Desktop through local servers. Today, we're introducing Integrations, allowing Claude to work seamlessly with remote MCP servers across the web and desktop apps. Developers can build and host servers that enhance Claude’s capabilities, while users can discover and connect any number of these to Claude.</p><p>When you connect your tools to Claude, it gains deep context about your work—understanding project histories, task statuses, and organizational knowledge—and can take actions across every surface. Claude becomes a more informed collaborator, helping you execute complex projects in one place with expert assistance at every step.</p><p>To start, you can choose from Integrations for 10 popular services, including <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/platform/remote-mcp-server">Atlassian’s Jira and Confluence</a>, <a href="https://zapier.com/mcp">Zapier</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare/tree/main">Cloudflare</a>, <a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/introducing-model-context-protocol-fin">Intercom</a>, <a href="https://developers.asana.com/docs/using-asanas-model-control-protocol-mcp-server">Asana</a>, <a href="https://developer.squareup.com/docs/mcp">Square</a>, <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-mcp/">Sentry</a>, <a href="https://www.paypal.ai/">PayPal</a>, <a href="https://linear.app/changelog/2025-05-01-mcp">Linear</a>, and <a href="https://api.dashboard.plaid.com/mcp/sse">Plaid</a>—with more to follow from companies like Stripe and GitLab. Developers can also create their own Integrations in as little as 30 minutes using our documentation or solutions like <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/remote-model-context-protocol-servers-mcp/">Cloudflare</a> that provide built-in OAuth authentication, transport handling, and integrated deployment.</p><p>Each integration drastically expands what Claude can do. Zapier, for example, connects thousands of apps through pre-built workflows, automating processes across your software stack. With the <a href="https://zapier.com/mcp">Zapier Integration</a>, Claude can access these apps and your custom workflows through conversation—even automatically pulling sales data from HubSpot and preparing meeting briefs based on your calendar.</p><p>With access to Atlassian’s Jira and Confluence, Claude can collaborate with you on building new products, managing tasks more effectively, and scaling your work by summarizing and creating multiple Confluence pages and Jira work items at once.</p><p>Connect Intercom to respond faster to user feedback. Intercom's AI agent Fin, now an MCP client, can take actions like filing bugs in Linear when users report issues. Chat with Claude to identify patterns and debug using Intercom's conversation history and user attributes—managing the entire workflow from user feedback to bug resolution in one conversation.</p><h2 id="advanced-research">Advanced Research</h2><p>We're introducing several new updates to build on our recently-released <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/research">Research</a> capability. Claude can now conduct deeper investigations across hundreds of internal and external sources, delivering more comprehensive reports in anywhere from five to 45 minutes.</p><p>With its new ability to do more complex research, available when you toggle on the Research button, Claude breaks down your request into smaller parts, investigating each deeply before compiling a comprehensive report. While most reports complete in five to 15 minutes, Claude may take up to 45 minutes for more complex investigations—work that would typically take hours of manual research.</p><p>We've also expanded Claude's data access. We launched Research with support for web search and Google Workspace, but now with Integrations, Claude can also search any application you connect. </p><p>When Claude incorporates information from sources, it provides clear citations that link directly to the original material. This transparency ensures you can confidently use Claude's research findings, knowing exactly where each insight originated.</p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2><p>Integrations and advanced Research are now available in beta on the Max, Team, and Enterprise plans, and will soon be available on Pro. Web search is now globally available to all <a href="http://claude.ai/">Claude.ai</a> paid plans. For more information on getting started with Integrations, MCP servers, and security and privacy practices when connecting data sources to Claude, visit our <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11175166-about-integrations-using-remote-mcp">Help Center</a>.  </p></div></article></div>]]></description>

<p>Welcome, weary traveller from the orange site! Let me tell you the tale of <span>roons</span> — a kit for building mechanical computers.</p>

<p>I got inspired a couple of years ago when I binged a bunch of mechanical logic gate YouTube videos. There are some unbelievably clever implementations — Steve Mould’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXaizglscw" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXaizglscw">water computer</a> was a particular inspiration.</p>



<p>Still, these mechanical logic gates usually end up too big to make any practical devices. I figured, how hard can it be to miniaturise them into a usable kit?</p>



<div><fieldset data-hintbox-type="foreshadowing"><legend>foreshadowing</legend><p>Very! It turned out the answer was <em>very hard</em>.</p></fieldset></div>



<h2>loom automaton</h2>



<blockquote>
<p>The Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves.</p>
<cite>Ada Lovelace</cite></blockquote>



<p>After noodling around with far too many prototypes, I settled on what I call a <strong>loom automaton</strong>. We place tiles (“<span>roons</span>”) on a loom of alternating bars that move up and down. The contours on these tiles guide marbles <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="false" alt="marble"></span> and holes <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="false" alt="hole"></span> in discretised steps, representing bitstreams.</p>

<p>Isn’t it <em>incredibly neat</em> that a literal physical loom turns out to be a great substrate for Lovelace’s metaphorical loom?</p>



<p>Anyway — you can think of this loom as a cellular automaton, where each cell is:</p>







<p>If you know of prior work on this kind of system, please <a href="https://whomtech.com/whomtech/contact/" data-type="page" data-id="156">get in touch</a>! I don’t claim the loom automaton is original; I just haven’t seen it elsewhere.</p>



<h2>why loom good</h2>



<p>Initially, I was making ad-hoc devices for each computer component — a gadget for number comparison, which worked <em>like this</em>; and a gadget for addition, which worked <em>like that</em>; etc.</p>



<p>The loom was a turning point. Instead of a loose collection of dissimilar gadgets that plug in together, <em>everything</em> is implemented on the loom. (Except peripherals, which we’ll get to later.) This gives us a <strong>common interface </strong>for stitching together whatever devices we need — memory, instruction sets, whatever. It makes it trivial to deliver power in synchronised discrete steps to every component.</p>



<p>I tried several variations on the loom: moving the marbles using alternating pins; continuously guiding the marbles using slides rippling in a wave; replacing gravity with magnetic potentials; etc. You can read more about these failed attempts in the hardware/prototypes deep dive.</p>

<h2>Turing completeness</h2>



<p>You can skip this section if it’s obvious that discretised marble movements are Turing complete, but then you’d miss out on the beautiful interactive simulator:</p>







<p>I learned JavaScript for this.</p>



<p>When the <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/xor">xor <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/xor.png" alt="xor"></a> <span>roon</span> above receives its inputs, a single <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="false" alt="marble"></span> (<span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="hole"></span> or <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="hole"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"></span>) can fall into the central channel, while <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"></span> will block each other. So an <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/xor">xor <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/xor.png" alt="xor"></a> implements XOR.</p>



<p>Other <span>roons</span> implement other logic gates. The <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/switch-back">canute <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/switch-back.png" alt="canute"></a> performs a check then kicks an <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="false" alt="marble"></span> back one step, which lets us implement carry-like functions on a marble bitstream. There are also <span>roons</span> like the <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/trap">trap <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/trap.png" alt="trap"></a> that can permanently store a piece of state.</p>



<p>Though actually, you don’t need any stateful <span>roons</span> to store state — you can just cycle a stream of <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="hole"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="hole"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="hole"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="hole"></span> round in a loop, bam, you’ve got a register:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="216" src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/static-register.gif" alt="7-bit static register"><figcaption>7-bit static register</figcaption></figure>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="216" src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/dynamic-register.gif" alt="7-bit read/write register"><figcaption>7-bit read/write register</figcaption></figure>



<p>We read from this register using a <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/switch">switch <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/switch.png" alt="switch"></a> to divert the path of an infinite stream of <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"></span>. Meanwhile, the register is constantly reading in from one of two data sources: itself, or an input stream, depending on a 3rd signal channel. While this channel is <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="false" alt="hole"></span>, the data loops; when it’s <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="false" alt="marble"></span>, it gets overwritten by the external input, letting us perform a write.</p>



<p>But I’m getting off track. Trivially, XOR gates are Turing complete; my job is done, that’s a computer, we can all go home. Thank you.</p>



<h2>convenience</h2>



<p>“But wait! Being Turing complete isn’t enough to not suck!”</p>



<p>That’s a good point. To actually make a <em>good</em> mechanical computer kit, we need a few other things:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Compactness</strong> — build interesting devices in a small area, with very few pieces — no warehouse-sized processors!</li>



<li><strong>Promptness</strong> — reasonable processing rate; don’t have to wait for <code>BB 10</code> steps before a computation finishes</li>



<li><strong>Fast editing</strong> — minimal friction to changing a pattern and running it. “Hot reloading” so a pattern can be edited while running.</li>



<li><strong>Saving and loading</strong> — can save your work to compact storage, then bring it back later</li>



<li><strong>Minimal</strong> — build many complex systems from a small number of core parts</li>
</ul>



<p>Basically I wanted a kit that’s actually practical and fun for building circuits.</p>



<h2>did you make one?</h2>



<p>… yes!</p>

<p>Here’s a binary adder made of a <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/long-turn">long turn <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/long-turn.png" alt="long turn"></a>, <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/switch-back">canute <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/switch-back.png" alt="canute"></a>, and <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/distributor">distributor <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/distributor.png" alt="distributor"></a> — which together are not much bigger than a postage stamp. (Wave your hands and amortise away the space occupied by the disk drive itself, I/O plumbing etc etc)</p>



<p>Because space is at such a premium, instead of staggering multiple XORs and ANDs, we just bundle it all into a single unit — it’s small but slow.</p>



<p>We can also do memory, latches, processors, counters, timers, counters etc. Follow the <a href="https://whomtech.com/tutorials/" data-type="page" data-id="178">tutorial</a> sequence to learn more.</p>



<h2>modularity</h2>



<p>I wanted it to be easy to store and run lots of different patterns. Each disk drive is reasonably pocket-sized, but there’s still a lot of space dedicated to the internal gear mechanism.</p>



<p>So here’s the removable disk system:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="216" src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/disk-load.gif" alt="loading a disk onto a drive"></figure>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="216" src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/save.gif" alt="removing a disk from a drive"></figure>



<p>This is pretty simple, but it took a long time to get right! Challenges included:</p>



<ul>
<li>Figuring out exactly how much of the mechanism I could shunt down into the disk drive, and how much I had to retain in the disk</li>



<li>Optimising magnet strengths and positions — need the save/load to work smoothly, while preventing the base from popping back up in operation</li>
</ul>



<p>We can also move individual bars between disks, or rearrange the order within a disk. This makes it easy to adjust a pattern if we started it in the wrong place.</p>



<h2>extendability</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="216" src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/snap-drives.gif" alt="connecting two drives together"></figure>



<p>If we need a bigger workspace, we just put drives next to each other. This works along both X and Y axes, so you can build 2D grids.</p>



<div><fieldset data-hintbox-type="foreshadowing"><legend>foreshadowing</legend><p>I’m fully aware there’s a whole other dimension available here — working on it!</p></fieldset></div>



<h3>binding</h3>



<p>Each face of the drive has a pair of north-south magnets at its ends. This lets it pair up with a 180-degree-rotated copy of itself.</p>



<p>The centre of each face also has a small raised nub next to a corresponding pocket. This locks the drive into a precise position.</p>



<h3>power</h3>



<p>We also need to transfer power through the system. Originally I used horizontal axles with hidden magnetic couplers, which looked very cool but had too many design issues.</p>



<p>Instead, each drive has a 2 x 2 gear grid, where each gear has an integrated barrel cam to move the bars up and down. When two drives are placed next to each other, the gears bind together.</p>



<p>Because <code>N</code> is even in our <code>N x N</code> gear grid, the drives all spin the same way. This matters because certain peripherals expect a particular direction of rotation.</p>



<h3>phase</h3>



<p>We want all the bars to move in phase. Connecting the drives up correctly is fiddly — it’s easy to accidentally offset the connection by a tooth or two.</p>



<p>To prevent this, the gears have a layer of <strong>phase baffles</strong> (I don’t know the technical term). These physically block the gears from connecting until they’re perfectly synced up.</p>

<p>Combining all these principles together gives us a lot of freedom in how we set up our workspace:</p>

<p>How practical are these big grids, though? More details in the hardware deep dive.</p>



<h2>storage</h2>



<p>I wanted to make <span>roons</span> easy to store. I already had the stud system for binding tiles to bars, so I just extended that. The bases of the drives accept studs, so you can stack them up.</p>



<p>I also looked for convenient places to store the smaller pieces. For example, the encabulator has a hollow core for marbles, <span>roons</span> can be stored upside-down in the travel lid.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="216" src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/pack.gif" alt="stacking a drive, encabulator, and lid"></figure>

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="771" src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122013150_AE-1024x771.jpg" alt="stack of several drives" srcset="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122013150_AE-1024x771.jpg 1024w, https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122013150_AE-300x226.jpg 300w, https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122013150_AE-768x578.jpg 768w, https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122013150_AE-1536x1157.jpg 1536w, https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122013150_AE.jpg 2040w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h2>peripherals?</h2>



<p>What an odd question, but — yes! Yes, <span>roons</span> has peripherals. These use the same 2×2 gear interface as the disk drives, so they plug into the grid and sync up.</p>



<p>There are two boring feature-complete peripherals:</p>



<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/tech-rundown/encabulator/" data-type="page" data-id="3037">encabulator</a> lets the user supply rotation to the system, powering each device.</li>



<li>The <strong>bucket</strong> is a bucket. <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="false" alt="marble"></span> can fall into it. This one was particularly challenging and took billions of research hours.</li>
</ul>



<p>The WIP peripherals are where things get spicy:</p>



<ul>
<li>The <strong>7-segment display</strong> (WIP) intakes 4-bit numbers on a cycle, converting them into the corresponding base ten digit (plus 6 special characters)</li>
</ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="771" src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122728642_AE-1024x771.jpg" alt="mockup of a 7-segment display peripheral" srcset="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122728642_AE-1024x771.jpg 1024w, https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122728642_AE-300x226.jpg 300w, https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122728642_AE-768x578.jpg 768w, https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122728642_AE-1536x1157.jpg 1536w, https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122728642_AE.jpg 2040w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>mockup 7-segment display for illustration — prototype coming soon</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>The <strong>numpad</strong> (WIP) converts keypresses of the digits 0-9 into 4-bit marble bitstreams.</li>



<li>The <strong>alphanumeric display</strong> (WIP) is a 6-bit extension of the 7-segment display, capable of displaying all letters of the alphabet, digits, and your favourite punctuation marks.</li>



<li>The <strong>hard drive</strong> (WIP) is space efficient marble data storage that can be used as input/output for other patterns.</li>



<li>The <strong>turbo encabulator</strong> (NES, Not Even Started) is a motorised encabulator for powering larger grids.</li>
</ul>



<p>Expect some big updates soon — these peripherals are what makes <span>roons</span> look like actual magic. For example, plugging a display into an adder:</p>







<p>Or chaining multiple displays together to get scrolling text (the bitstream passes through):</p>







<p>But I am just one person, and physically implementing these designs takes me a <em>long</em> time. So no mechanical text displays for you — yet.</p>



<h2>materials and manufacturing</h2>



<p>Most components are prototyped in 3D-printed PLA. Plans are to switch to injection-moulded ABS for mass production, though I’ve got a couple of more complex plans up my sleeve depending on demand.</p>



<p>I print these using three Bambu Labs A1 Minis. These are <em>really really good</em>, by the way.</p>



<p>Many of these pieces would be better prototyped in something like resin, but FDM turned out to be good enough; it’s what I was familiar with and had access to.</p>



<h3>magnets</h3>



<p>Each <span>roon</span> needs to cling to the bars of the loom. Consequently, I have manually superglued approximately 6,000 tiny neodymium magnets, and no longer have fingerprints.</p>



<h3>bars</h3>



<p>The bars of the disk need to be magnetic (or at least magnetically receptive). But inserting individual magnets would be too expensive and tedious.</p>



<p>Therefore, I manually trim down Copper-Coated Mild Steel (CCMS) brazing rods with a pair of bolt cutters, then embed them in the bars. You wouldn’t believe how many failed approaches it took to find this solution — could be an entire post in itself.</p>



<h2>website</h2>



<p>I took a calculated risk in setting up the whomtech website, and used two unproven technologies:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>WordPress</strong> is a little-known website builder. We hope that the endorsement of an industry titan like whomtech can give this underused piece of tech some exposure.</li>



<li><strong>JavaScript</strong> is a fresh, new approach to minimising your serotonin. It combines the elegance of Java with the type safety of punching yourself in the throat.</li>
</ul>



<p>You can read more JS slander in the software deep dive.</p>



<h2>disappointments</h2>



<p>So is <span>roons</span> an unmitigated success?</p>



<p>No! Don’t worry, there are many mitigations:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Peripherals behind schedule</strong> –The really cool peripheral prototypes are nowhere near production ready. The challenge is to integrate them with the marble bitstream concept, while minimising the number of parts and maximising reliability. I’d hoped to have this done by now — it’s absolutely possible, but I am slow.</li>



<li><strong>Piece reliability</strong> — Newer <span>roons</span> like the <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/crossing">crossing <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/crossing.png" alt="crossing"></a> haven’t hit the level of reliability I want. “Mostly working” isn’t good enough — we need 99.9%+ reliability to build anything interesting. This isn’t a threat to the underlying Turing completeness, but it does reduce the kit’s convenience.</li>



<li><strong>Piece interoperability</strong> — This is the real curse. Getting each <span>roon</span> to interoperate reliability with every other <span>roon</span> is exponentially (quadratically?) difficult. I’m happy with the basic interactions, but there are esoteric cases where an interaction “should” work but doesn’t.</li>



<li><strong>Ease of use</strong> — <span>roons</span> can be small and fiddly. I’m used to them by now, but there’s still work to be done to make it easier for newcomers.</li>



<li><strong>Simulator</strong> — I design the tutorials using a janky simulator tool I built. I wanted to polish it up before general release, but here we are.</li>



<li><strong>Site and tutorials</strong> — There’s still tons of tutorial content to write, and parts of the site that need attention.</li>



<li><strong>Additional <span>roons</span></strong> — There are many, many specific <span>roons</span> that I haven’t had time to develop yet: e.g. enhanced lateral movement, more state, general conveniences, 3D movement, etc</li>
</ul>



<h2>more technical stuff</h2>



<p>A <em>ton</em> of research and experimentation went into this project over the last couple of years. Some of it’s pretty interesting! You can read the mind-numbing details here:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<section id="newslist"><article data-news-id="151"></article></section><topcomment><article data-comment-id="151-" id="151-"><span><span><a href="https://antirez.com/user/antirez">antirez</a></span> 34 minutes ago. 15371 views.  </span><pre>Five months ago, I rejoined Redis and quickly started to talk with my colleagues about a possible switch to the AGPL license, only to discover that there was already an ongoing discussion, a very old one, too. Many people, within the company, had the feeling that the AGPL was a better pick than SSPL, and while eventually Redis switched to the SSPL license, the internal discussion continued.

I tried to give more strength to the ongoing pro-AGPL license side. My feeling was that the SSPL, in practical terms, failed to be accepted by the community. The OSI wouldn’t accept it, nor would the software community regard the SSPL as an open license. In little time, I saw the hypothesis getting more and more traction, at all levels within the company hierarchy.

I’ll be honest: I truly wanted the code I wrote for the new Vector Sets data type to be released under an open source license. Writing open source software is too rooted in me: I rarely wrote anything else in my career. I’m too old to start now. This may be childish, but I wrote Vector Sets with a huge amount of enthusiasm exactly because I knew Redis (and my new work) was going to be open source again.

I understand that the core of our work is to improve Redis, to continue building a good system, useful, simple, able to change with the requirements of the software stack. Yet, returning back to an open source license is the basis for such efforts to be coherent with the Redis project, to be accepted by the user base, and to contribute to a human collective effort that is larger than any single company. So, honestly, while I can’t take credit for the license switch, I hope I contributed a little bit to it, because today I’m happy. I’m happy that Redis is open source software again, under the terms of the AGPLv3 license.

Now, time to go back to the terminal, to show Redis users some respect by writing the best code I’m able to write, and make Vector Sets more useful and practical: I have a few more ideas for improvements, and I hope that more will be stimulated by your feedback (it is already happening). Good hacking!

P.S. Redis 8, the first version of Redis with the new license, is also GA today, with a many new features and speed improvements of the core: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://redis.io/blog/redis-8-ga/">https://redis.io/blog/redis-8-ga/</a>
