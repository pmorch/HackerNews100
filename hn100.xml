            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The NIST elliptic curves that power much of modern cryptography were generated in the late ‘90s by hashing seeds provided by the NSA. How were the seeds generated? Rumor has it that they are in turn hashes of English sentences, but the person who picked them, Dr. Jerry Solinas, passed away in early 2023 leaving behind a cryptographic mystery, some conspiracy theories, and an historical password cracking challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Together with some generous matchers, I’m announcing a <s>$8,192</s> $12,288 (12 Ki$) bounty for cracking these five hashes, tripled to $36,864 if the recipient chooses to donate it to a 501(c)(3) charity of their choice.</strong></p>

</code></pre>
<p>Thank you to Amir Omidi, Chris Palmer, Colm MacCárthaigh, David Adrian, David Anderson, Jeff Hodges, Matt Green, Matthew McPherrin, Paul Kehrer, Ryan Sleevi, and Soatok for contributing to the bounty, and to Steve Weis for the research that inspired this.</p>
<h2 id="step-back-what-is-this-about">Step back, what is this about?</h2>
<p>The NIST elliptic curves (P-192, P-224, P-256, P-384, and P-521<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>) were published by NIST in FIPS 186-2 in 2000, and generated “verifiably at random” according to ANSI X9.62 by taking an arbitrary seed, hashing it with SHA-1, and using the output to derive some of the parameters.</p>
<p>A <em>lot</em> of cryptography uses NIST curves, and especially P-256 and P-384. They are in the Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite (the successor of Suite B), and are the curves used by the ECDSA X.509 certificates that secure much of the web. They’re a big deal.</p>
<p>Steve Weis has recently published <a href="https://saweis.net/posts/nist-curve-seed-origins.html?ref=words.filippo.io">a well researched article</a> on everything we know about those arbitrary seeds embedded in the FIPS 186 specification. Apparently, they were provided by the NSA, and generated by Jerry Solinas in 1997. He allegedly generated them by hashing, presumably with SHA-1, some English sentences that he later forgot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Jerry] told me that he used a seed that was something like:<br>
<code>SEED = SHA1("Jerry deserves a raise.")</code><br>
After he did the work, his machine was replaced or upgraded, and the actual phrase that he used was lost. When the controversy first came up, Jerry tried every phrase that he could think of that was similar to this, but none matched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s unfortunate, because the NIST curves are—surprisingly—looking better and better: we now have <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1060?ref=words.filippo.io">complete addition formulas</a> for them, mitigating their major footgun; we know how to design safer interfaces for them; and we painfully learned to appreciate the value of prime order curves immune to cofactor attacks. However, there is—mostly amongst non-practitioners—some fear that the NSA could have picked the seeds to select some intentionally weak curves.</p>
<p>Do I think those fears are well-founded? No. Koblitz and Menezes make a good argument in <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1018.pdf?ref=words.filippo.io"><em>A riddle wrapped in an enigma</em></a> that even with full control over the seed, the NSA would have had to be aware of a class of weak curves so large that it’s not plausible that no one in academia or industry discovered them in 25 years.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Anyway, some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt?ref=words.filippo.io">FUD</a> persists around the otherwise pretty good NIST curves that would be good to clear up, even if the English preimage of the hashes <a href="https://twitter.com/lauriewired/status/1700982575291142594?ref=words.filippo.io">is not a complete guarantee of rigidity</a><sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>That’s where this bounty comes in. Finding the pre-seeds, the inputs to the hash that generated the seeds, is the bread and butter of password crackers and brainwallet bruteforcers. <strong>This is a call to arms for them to join the search, help fill in a page of cryptographic history, and collect a large bounty or donate an even larger one to charity.</strong></p>
<h2 id="ok-so-what-do-we-know-about-the-hashes">Ok, so what do we know about the hashes?</h2>
<p>To recap Steve Weis’s post, the inputs are probably English phrases which mention Jerry Solinas, possibly someone else, and probably a counter. If you’re actually going for it I recommend reading Steve’s post in full.</p>
<p>The counter has to be there because only one in every 192 to 521 hashes is actually good to make a curve out of, depending the bit size of the curve. (This is because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem?ref=words.filippo.io">one in every ln(N) numbers less than N is prime, for large enough N</a>.) There’s a <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&amp;i=Power%5B%5C%2840%291+-+Divide%5B1%2C521%5D%5C%2841%29%2Cx%5D+%3D+0.01&amp;ref=words.filippo.io">99% chance the counter is less than 2400 for the largest curve</a>, and less than 1175 for P-256.</p>
<p>The seeds for P-192 and P-256 appeared as examples in the previous ANSI X9.62 standard, while all the others were new in FIPS 186-2, so they might have been generated from differently structured sentences.</p>
<p>Since testing more hashes is nearly free, I recommend also targeting all the examples from ANSI X9.62 that didn’t make the FIPS standard, as well as the seeds for the binary curves in FIPS 186-2, although they are not included in the bounty. Here’s a recap.</p>

<p>The format of the string is part of the mystery. It could end with a period or not, end with a newline or not, the counter could be decimal (with or without leading zeroes) or binary (16 or 32 bit), and it could come after the period or separated some other way. The same sentence with different counters could have been used to generate all the seeds, or they could be different sentences, or they could include the curve name or size. Human memory is notoriously fallible, so it could also be that some of the details in the second-hand recollections are wrong.</p>
<p>The good news is that SHA-1 is tremendously fast to bruteforce, and <em>YOU</em> are the experts in cracking passphrases you know nothing about.</p>
<h2 id="cool-what%E2%80%99s-the-fine-print">Cool, what’s the fine print?</h2>
<p>The bounty will pay out to the first person(s) to email the pre-seeds for the five prime-order NIST curves to <a href="mailto:seeds@filippo.io">seeds@filippo.io</a>.</p>
<p>Half the bounty ($6,144) will pay out to the first submission of <em>at least one</em> pre-seed, and the other half will pay out to the first submission of <em>all five</em> pre-seeds. They can of course go to the same person, so don’t wait to have them all to submit. Even one would make history.</p>
<p>If successful, you can either choose to receive the cash bounty, or select a U.S. 501(c)(3) charity to receive triple the amount. We reserve the right to veto charity choices dramatically incompatible with our values, but we won’t be jerks about it. If it’s not legally allowed for a U.S. person or Italian national to send money to you, you will have to select the charity option. You’re responsible for any taxes on the cash bounty. I fully trust every matcher, and I am guaranteeing the full amount of the bounty personally, so you don’t have to.</p>
<p>Put “ANTISPAM” in the subject line of any submission to hit my allowlisting rules. The Received header of my mail host will be the unappealable criterion of what submission arrived first.</p>
<p>The bounty expires if the seeds become publicly known, otherwise it’s valid until announced otherwise on this page. If the bounty is being cancelled or lowered, it will be announced six months in advance. (We don’t want anyone to feel cheated of their resources.)</p>
<p>We don’t actually care how you find the seeds. It can be bruteforcing, clever guessing, sleuth work tracking down NSA employees (don’t get arrested), or even recovering that old backup of when you used to work at NIST. If you don’t want us to, we won’t ask questions.</p>
<p>May the hashrate be ever in your favor, and let's fill out a page of cryptographic history.</p>

</li>
<li id="fn2"><p>The NSA's precedents, namely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG?ref=words.filippo.io">Dual_EC_DRBG</a>, are why some people find the seeds suspicious. I find them reassuring. First, selecting weak seeds (which are just hash inputs, not "keys" like in Dual_EC_DRBG), would not be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOBUS?ref=words.filippo.io">NOBUS backdoor</a>. Second, the Dual_EC_DRBG design immediately stuck out like a sore thumb and library authors had to be paid to implement it; this suggests the NSA is <em>kinda bad</em> at backdoors, not magical. <a href="#fnref2">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Rigidity is the design generalization of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing-up-my-sleeve_number?ref=words.filippo.io">nothing up my sleeves numbers</a>. The idea is that if you set your goals explicitly and then make only obvious and rational and optimal choices in a design, there is no wiggle room to pick intentionally weak outcomes. FWIW, I think rigidity is overrated: there is no such thing as an objectively best choice, and reasonable people disagree, and it’s possible to craft rational arguments for many different choices. Anyway, it’d be nice to settle the argument by bringing the NIST curves up in their level of rigidity by cracking the seeds. <a href="#fnref3">↩︎</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Although not everyone knows it, ChromeOS is effectively a Linux distribution. That fact is effectively hidden and I can understand why: Linux can be a scary word to mainstream consumers. But there’s no denying the fact that ChromeOS is Linux. It uses a Linux kernel, hidden away by the graphical user interface, also known as a desktop environment. Between the <a href="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/chromeos-117-release-adds-several-new-chromebook-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="ChromeOS 117 release adds several new Chromebook features">new Material You design</a> and move to <a href="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/chromeos-116-may-begin-the-lacros-browser-push-to-chromebooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="ChromeOS 116 may begin the Lacros browser push to Chromebooks">break apart the Chrome browser from ChromeOS</a>, now more than ever, ChromeOS is Linux with Google’s desktop environment.</p><p>To help illustrate the point about desktop environments, it’s worth explaining what one actually is. Particularly when it comes to Linux systems.</p><p>When you install Linux, you choose a distribution. It could be Arch, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, or in my case, <a href="https://pop.system76.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pop OS!</a>. The distribution comes with a Linux kernel along with software and modifications for that particular distribution. Think of the kernel as the lowest level of software. It helps other software speak to the hardware to make a cohesive system. It’s what lets you browse your files through an application or the Terminal, for example.</p><p><span data-ez-name="aboutchromebooks_com-medrectangle-3"></span><span><span><img src="https://go.ezodn.com/utilcave_com/ezoicbwa.png" alt="Ezoic" loading="lazy" title="ezoic" name="?pageview_id=ecb46d62-204a-4e94-6acf-e0d78f5d4c25&amp;ad_position_id=187&amp;impression_group_id=aboutchromebooks_com-medrectangle-3/2023-10-05/8762120453988575&amp;ad_size=580x400&amp;domain_id=82556&amp;url=https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/now-more-than-ever-chromeos-is-linux-with-googles-desktop-environment/"></span></span></p><p>But that’s only part of the system. The other part is how you interact with it. Some people prefer to simply use the Terminal and command line for everything. And there’s a relatively steep learning curve involved with that approach. So there are graphical desktop environments to help with that. These visually show clickable folders, for example, or have an application launcher menu, among other things.</p><p>And there’s no lack of standard desktop environments available to Linux users, all of which are customizable.

Google uses a customized version of Linux that you never see. Well, unless you turn on the Linux container, which gets you Debian Linux and a Terminal. Even though you can install Linux desktop applications for that container, you can’t use it to modify the Linux code that runs ChromeOS.</p><p>So it’s a bit locked down, particuarly compared to regular Linux. When I use Pop OS! for example, I have total control to change just about anything I want to.</p><p>Here’s a look at how I typically use that Linux machine on an ultra-wide monitor:</p><p><span data-ez-name="aboutchromebooks_com-box-4"></span><span><span><img src="https://go.ezodn.com/utilcave_com/ezoicbwa.png" alt="Ezoic" loading="lazy" title="ezoic" name="?pageview_id=ecb46d62-204a-4e94-6acf-e0d78f5d4c25&amp;ad_position_id=189&amp;impression_group_id=aboutchromebooks_com-box-4/2023-10-05/5772599447941272&amp;ad_size=250x250&amp;domain_id=82556&amp;url=https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/now-more-than-ever-chromeos-is-linux-with-googles-desktop-environment/"></span></span></p><figure><img title="IMG_2360 - About Chromebooks" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="960" src="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_2360-1280x960.jpg" alt="" data-ezsrcset="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_2360-1280x960.jpg 1280w,https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_2360-300x225.jpg 300w,https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_2360-150x113.jpg 150w,https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_2360-768x576.jpg 768w,https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_2360-1536x1152.jpg 1536w,https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_2360-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" ezimgfmt="rs rscb836 src ng ngcb835 srcset" data-ezsrc="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_2360-1280x960.jpg" srcset="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_2360-1280x960.jpg 1280w,https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_2360-300x225.jpg 300w,https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_2360-150x113.jpg 150w,https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_2360-768x576.jpg 768w,https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_2360-1536x1152.jpg 1536w,https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_2360-2048x1536.jpg 2048w"></figure><p>Note that when using applications, whether it’s just one or a dozen, all of the screen is being used.

Don’t get me wrong: ChromeOS is great at what it does. Google has smartly used Linux without scaring everyday people from using Linux. That’s a good thing.</p><p>However, my needs are changing a bit. I spend far more time in desktop applications than I used to. Most of that time is for my coding education. Yes, I do use the Linux version of Microsoft Visual Code on my Chromebook. And it works just as well as the same app on a traditional Linux or Windows machine. So I’m not giving anything up there.</p><figure><img title="Visual Studio code on Buster after Stretch restore - About Chromebooks" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-05-at-11.48.19-AM-1024x683.png" alt="ChromeOS runs Linux desktop applications just fine." data-ezsrcset="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-05-at-11.48.19-AM-1024x683.png 1024w,https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-05-at-11.48.19-AM-300x200.png 300w,https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-05-at-11.48.19-AM-768x512.png 768w,https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-05-at-11.48.19-AM-1536x1024.png 1536w,https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-05-at-11.48.19-AM-2048x1365.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" ezimgfmt="rs rscb836 src ng ngcb835 srcset" data-ezsrc="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-05-at-11.48.19-AM-1024x683.png" srcset="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-05-at-11.48.19-AM-1024x683.png 1024w,https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-05-at-11.48.19-AM-300x200.png 300w,https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-05-at-11.48.19-AM-768x512.png 768w,https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-05-at-11.48.19-AM-1536x1024.png 1536w,https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-05-at-11.48.19-AM-2048x1365.png 2048w"></figure><p>No, the fact that I can run Linux applications on a Chromebook is a bonus.

If the primary purpose is to run those Android apps, you’re better off using an Android phone or tablet because the software is optimized for those titles. Occasionally Android app use on a Chromebook is fine for most people but I wouldn’t say it’s a core strength of ChromeOS.

<p>We will begin with a simple program with a throughput of around 3.5GiB/s, and improve its performance twentyfold.

<!--
This exercise won't be of much practical use --- we shouldn't be using pipes for high-performance inter-process communication anyway. However, it will shed some light on common themes when dealing with IO and the kernel, and on how one can go about identifying what's slow.
-->
<p>The post was inspired by reading <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/215216/high-throughput-fizz-buzz/236630#236630">a highly optimized FizzBuzz program</a>, which pushes output to a pipe at a rate of ~35GiB/s on my laptop.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Our first goal will be to match that speed, explaining every step as we go along. We’ll also add an additional performance-improving measure, which is not needed in FizzBuzz since the bottleneck is actually computing the output, not IO, at least on my machine.</p>
<p>We will proceed as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="#first-version">A first slow version of our pipe test bench;</a></li>
<li><a href="#trouble-with-write">How pipes are implemented internally, and why writing and reading from them is slow;</a></li>

</ol>
<p>Section 4 is the heaviest on Linux kernel internals, so it might be interesting even if you’re familiar with the other topics treated in the post. For readers not familiar with the topics treated, only basic knowledge of C is assumed.</p>
<p>Let’s begin!</p>
</div>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<ol>
<li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>This will be similar in style to my <a href="https://mazzo.li/posts/vectorized-atan2.html"><code>atan2f</code> performance investigation</a>, although the program in question will only be useful for learning.</p>
<p>Moreover, we will optimize code at a different level. While tuning <code>atan2f</code> consisted in micro-optimizations guided by the assembly output, tuning our pipe program will involve looking at <code>perf</code> events and reducing various sorts of kernel overhead.<a href="#fnref1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2" role="doc-endnote"><p>The tests were run on an Intel Skylake i7-8550U CPU, and on Linux 5.17.</p>
<p>Your mileage <em>will</em> vary, since the Linux internals that power the programs described in this post have been under constant change for the past couple of years, and will probably continue to be tweaked in future releases.

</ol>
</section>
<h2 id="first-version">The challenge, and a slow first version <a href="#first-version">#</a></h2>
<div>
<p>First of all, let’s start with measuring the performance of <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/215216/high-throughput-fizz-buzz/236630#236630">the fabled FizzBuzz program</a>, following the rules laid down by the StackOverflow post:</p>
<pre><code>% ./fizzbuzz | pv &gt;/dev/null
 422GiB 0:00:16 [36.2GiB/s]</code></pre>
<p><code>pv</code> is “pipe viewer”, <a href="http://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml">a handy utility</a> to measure the throughput of data flowing through a pipe. So <code>fizzbuzz</code> is producing output at a rate of 36GiB/s.</p>
<p><code>fizzbuzz</code> writes the output in blocks as big as the L2 cache, to strike a good balance between cheap access to memory and minimizing IO overhead.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>On my machine, the L2 cache is 256KiB. Throughout this post, we’ll also output blocks of 256KiB, but without “computing” anything. Essentially, we’ll try to measure the upper bound for programs writing to a pipe with a reasonable buffer size.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>While <code>fizzbuzz</code> uses <code>pv</code> to measure speed, our setup will be slightly different: we’ll implement the programs on both ends of the pipe. This is so that we fully control the code involved in pushing and pulling data from the pipe.</p>
</div>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<ol start="4">
<li id="fn4" role="doc-endnote"><p>While we fix the buffer size, the numbers are actually not wildly different if we use different buffer sizes, given that other bottlenecks kick in.<a href="#fnref4" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<div>
<p>The code is available <a href="https://github.com/bitonic/pipes-speed-test">in my <code>pipes-speed-test</code> repo</a>. <code>write.cpp</code> implements the writing, and <code>read.cpp</code> the reading. <code>write</code> repeatedly writes the same 256KiB forever. <code>read</code> reads through 10GiB of data and terminates, printing the throughput in GiB/s. Both executables accept a variety of command line options to change their behavior.</p>
<p>The first attempt at reading and writing from pipes will be using the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/write"><code>write</code></a> and <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/read"><code>read</code></a> syscalls, using the same buffer size as <code>fizzbuzz</code>. Here’s a view of the writing end:</p>

<div>
<p>This snippet and following ones omit all error checking for brevity.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The <code>memset</code> ensures that the output will be printable, but also plays another role, as we’ll discuss later.</p>
<p>The work is all done by the <code>write</code> call, the rest is making sure that the whole buffer is written. The read end is very similar, but <code>read</code>ing data into <code>buf</code>, and terminating when enough has been read.</p>

<pre><code>% ./write | ./read
3.7GiB/s, 256KiB buffer, 40960 iterations (10GiB piped)</code></pre>
<p>We’re writing the same 256KiB buffer filled with <code>'X'</code>s 40960 times, and measuring the throughput. What’s worrying is that we’re 10 times slower than <code>fizzbuzz</code>! And we’re not doing any work, just writing bytes to the pipe.</p>
<p>It turns out that we can’t get much faster than this by using <code>write</code> and <code>read</code>.</p>
<h2 id="trouble-with-write">The trouble with <code>write</code> <a href="#trouble-with-write">#</a></h2>
<div>
<p>To find out what our program is spending time on, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perf_(Linux)"><code>perf</code></a>:<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<pre><code>% perf record -g sh -c './write | ./read'
3.2GiB/s, 256KiB buffer, 40960 iterations (10GiB piped)
[ perf record: Woken up 6 times to write data ]
[ perf record: Captured and wrote 2.851 MB perf.data (21201 samples) ]</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-g</code> instructs perf to record call graphs: this will allow us to take a top-down look at where time is being spent.</p>
<p>We can take a look at where time is spent using <code>perf report</code>. Here is a lightly redacted excerpt, breaking down where <code>write</code> spends its time:<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<pre><code>% perf report -g --symbol-filter=write
-   48.05%     0.05%  write    libc-2.33.so       [.] __GI___libc_write
   - 48.04% __GI___libc_write
      - 47.69% entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe
         - do_syscall_64
            - 47.54% ksys_write
               - 47.40% vfs_write
                  - 47.23% new_sync_write
                     - pipe_write
                        + 24.08% copy_page_from_iter
                        + 11.76% __alloc_pages
                        + 4.32% schedule
                        + 2.98% __wake_up_common_lock

                          0.66% prepare_to_wait_event
</code></pre>
<p>47% of the time is spent in <code>pipe_write</code>, which is what <code>write</code> resolves to if we’re writing to a pipe. This is not surprising — we’re spending roughly half of the time writing, and the other half reading.</p>
<p>Within <code>pipe_write</code>, 3/4 of the time is spent copying or allocating pages (<code>copy_page_from_iter</code> and <code>__alloc_pages</code>). If we already have an idea of how communication between the kernel and userspace works this might make some sense. Regardless, to fully understand what’s happening we must first understand how pipes work.</p>

<section role="doc-endnotes">

<li id="fn6" role="doc-endnote"><p>Note that here we’re profiling a shell invocation including both the pipe reading and writing — <code>perf record</code> follows all child processes by default.<a href="#fnref6" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7" role="doc-endnote"><p>When profiling this program, I noticed that the <code>perf</code> output was being polluted by information from the <a href="https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/psi/docs/overview">“Pressure Stall Information” infrastructure (PSI)</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore the numbers are taken from a kernel compiled with PSI disabled. This can be achieved by putting <code>CONFIG_PSI=n</code> in the kernel build configuration. In NixOS:</p>
<pre><code>boot.kernelPatches = [{
  name = "disable-psi";
  patch = null;
  extraConfig = '' 
    PSI n 
  '';
}];</code></pre>
<p>Moreover, the kernel debug symbols must be present for <code>perf</code> to correctly show where time is spent while in syscalls. How to install the symbols varies from distro to distro. In recent NixOS versions they are installed by default.<a href="#fnref7" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<h3 id="what-are-pipes-made-of">What are pipes made of? <a href="#what-are-pipes-made-of">#</a></h3>
<p>The data structure holding a pipe can be found in <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/f443e374ae131c168a065ea1748feac6b2e76613/include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h#L34"><code>include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h</code></a>, and the operations on it in <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/f443e374ae131c168a065ea1748feac6b2e76613/fs/pipe.c"><code>fs/pipe.c</code></a>.</p>
<p>A Linux pipe is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer">ring buffer</a> holding references to pages where the data is written to and read from:</p>
<p><img src="https://mazzo.li/assets/images/fast-pipes-pipe-ring.png"></p>
<p>In the image above the ring buffer has 8 slots, but we might have more or less, the default being 16. Each page is 4KiB on x86-64, but might be of different sizes on other architectures. In total, this pipe can hold at most 32KiB of data. This is a key point: every pipe has an upper bound on the total amount of data it can hold before it’s full.</p>
<p>The shaded part of the diagram represents the current pipe data, the non-shaded part the empty space in the pipe.</p>
<p>Somewhat counterintuitively, <code>head</code> stores the write-end of the pipe. That is, writers will write into the buffer pointed at by <code>head</code>, and increase <code>head</code> accordingly if they need to move onto the next buffer. Within the write buffer, <code>len</code> stores how much we’ve written in it.</p>
<p>Conversely, <code>tail</code> stores the read-end of the pipe: readers will start consuming the pipe from there. <code>offset</code> indicates where to start reading from.</p>
<p>Note that <code>tail</code> can appear <em>after</em> <code>head</code>, like in the picture, since we’re working with a circular/ring buffer. Also note that some slots might be unused when we haven’t filled the pipe completely — the <code>NULL</code> cells in the middle. If the pipe is full (no <code>NULL</code>s and no free space in the pages), <code>write</code> will block. If the pipe is empty (all <code>NULL</code>s), <code>read</code> will block.</p>
<p>Here’s an abridged version of the C data structures in <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/f443e374ae131c168a065ea1748feac6b2e76613/include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h#L34"><code>pipe_fs_i.h</code></a>:</p>

<p>Let’s now go to <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/f443e374ae131c168a065ea1748feac6b2e76613/fs/pipe.c#L416">the definition of <code>pipe_write</code></a>, to try and make sense of the <code>perf</code> output shown before.</p>
<p>Here is a simplified explanation of how <code>pipe_write</code> works:</p>

<p>The operations described above are protected by a lock, which <code>pipe_write</code> <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/2c85ebc57b3e1817b6ce1a6b703928e113a90442/fs/pipe.c#L416">acquires</a> and releases as necessary.</p>
<p><code>pipe_read</code> is the mirror image of <code>pipe_write</code>, except that we consume pages, free them when we’ve fully read them, and update <code>tail</code>.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>So, we now have a quite unpleasant picture of what is going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>We copy each page twice, once from user memory to the kernel, and back again to the kernel to user memory;</li>
<li>The copying is done one 4KiB page at a time, interspersed with other activity, such as the synchronization between read and write, and page allocation and freeing;</li>
<li>We are working with memory that might not be contiguous, since we’re constantly allocating new pages;</li>
<li>We’re acquiring and releasing the pipe lock.</li>
</ul>
<p>On this machine, sequential RAM reading clocks at around 16GiB/s:</p>
</div>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<ol start="9">
<li id="fn9" role="doc-endnote"><p>One single “spare page” called <code>tmp_page</code> is actually kept around by <code>pipe_read</code>, and reused by <code>pipe_write</code>.</p>
<p>However, since this is always only a single page, I couldn’t leverage it to achieve higher performance given that the page reuse is counteracted by fixed overhead when calling <code>pipe_write</code> and <code>pipe_read</code>.<a href="#fnref9" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

102400.00 MiB transferred (15921.22 MiB/sec)</code></pre>
<p>Given all the fiddliness listed above, a 4x slowdown compared to single-threaded sequential RAM speed is not that surprising.</p>
<p>Tweaking the buffer size or the pipe size to reduce the amount of syscall and synchronization overhead, or tuning other parameters will not get us very far. Luckily, there is a way to get around the slowness of <code>write</code> and of <code>read</code> altogether.</p>
<h2 id="splicing">Splicing to the rescue <a href="#splicing">#</a></h2>
<p>This copying of buffers from user memory to the kernel and back is a frequent thorn in the side of people needing to do fast IO. One common solution is to just cut the kernel out of the picture and perform IO operations directly. For example we might interact directly with a network card and bypass the kernel for low-latency networking.</p>
<p>In general when we write to a socket, or a file, or in our case a pipe, we’re first writing to a buffer somewhere in the kernel, and then let the kernel do its work. In the case of pipes, the pipe <em>is</em> a series of buffers in the kernel. All this copying is undesirable if we’re in the business of performance.</p>
<div>
<p>Luckily, Linux includes system calls to speed things up when we want to move data to and from pipes, without copying. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/splice.2.html"><code>splice</code></a> moves data from a pipe to a file descriptor, and vice-versa.</li>
<li><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/vmsplice.2.html"><code>vmsplice</code></a> moves data from user memory into a pipe.<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Crucially, both operations work without copying anything.</p>
<p>Now that we know how pipes work, we can already vaguely imagine how the two operations function: they just “grab” an existing buffer from somewhere and put it into the pipe ring buffer, or the reverse, rather than allocating new pages as needed:</p>
<p><img src="https://mazzo.li/assets/images/vmsplice-intuition.svg"></p>
</div>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<ol start="10">
<li id="fn10" role="doc-endnote"><p>Technically, <code>vmsplice</code> also supports transferring data in the other direction, although not in a useful way. As the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/vmsplice.2.html">man page</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>vmsplice</code> really supports true splicing only from user memory to a pipe. In the opposite direction, it actually just copies the data to user space.</p>
</blockquote>

</ol>
</section>
<p>We’ll soon see exactly how this works.</p>
<h3 id="splicing-in-practice">Splicing in practice <a href="#splicing-in-practice">#</a></h3>
<p>Let’s replace <code>write</code> with <code>vmsplice</code>. This is the signature for <code>vmsplice</code>:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>struct</span> iovec <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2">  <span>void</span>  <span>*</span>iov_base<span>;</span> <span>// Starting address</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3">  <span>size_t</span> iov_len<span>;</span>  <span>// Number of bytes</span></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><span>};</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5"></span>
<span id="cb9-6"><span>// Returns how much we've spliced into the pipe</span></span>

<span id="cb9-8">  <span>int</span> fd<span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>struct</span> iovec <span>*</span>iov<span>,</span> <span>size_t</span> nr_segs<span>,</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> flags</span>
<span id="cb9-9"><span>);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<div>
<p><code>fd</code> is the target pipe, <code>struct iovec *iov</code> is an array of buffers we’ll be moving to the pipe. Note that <code>vmsplice</code> returns how much was “spliced” into the pipe, which might not be the full amount, much like how <code>write</code> returns how much was written. Remember that pipes are bounded by how many slots they have in the ring buffer, and <code>vmsplice</code> is not exempt from this restriction.</p>
<p>We also need to be a bit careful when using <code>vmsplice</code>. Since the user memory is moved to the pipe without copying, we must ensure that the read-end consumes it before we can reuse the spliced buffer.</p>
<p>For this reason <code>fizzbuzz</code> uses a double buffering scheme, which works as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Split the 256KiB buffer in two;</li>
<li>Set the pipe size to 128KiB, this will have the effect of setting the pipe ring buffer to have 128KiB/4KiB = 32 slots;</li>
<li>Alternate between writing to the first half-buffer and using <code>vmsplice</code> to move it to the pipe and doing the same with the other half.</li>
</ol>
<p>The fact that the pipe size is set to 128KiB, and that we wait for <code>vmsplice</code> to fully output one 128KiB buffer, ensures that by the time we’re done with one iteration of <code>vmsplice</code> we <em>know</em> that the the previous buffer has been fully read — otherwise we would not have been able to fully <code>vmsplice</code> the new 128KiB buffer into the 128KiB pipe.</p>
<p>Now, we’re not actually writing anything to the buffers, but we’ll keep the double buffering scheme since a similar scheme would be required for any program actually writing content.<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Our write loop now looks something like this:</p>
</div>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<ol start="11">
<li id="fn11" role="doc-endnote"><p>Travis Downs <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31596169">pointed out</a> that this scheme might still be unsafe, since the page could be spliced further, therefore extending its lifetime. This problem is also present in the original FizzBuzz post.</p>
<p>It’s actually not entirely clear to me whether <code>vmsplice</code> without <code>SPLICE_F_GIFT</code> is actually unsafe — the man page for <code>vmsplice</code> implies it shouldn’t be. However, it’s definitely the case that particular care is needed to achieve zero copy piping while maintaining safety.</p>
<p>In the test program the reading end splices the pipe into <code>/dev/null</code>, so it could be that the kernel knows that the pages can be spliced without copying, but I have not verified whether this is what’s actually happening.<a href="#fnref11" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<p>As the name suggests, <code>iov_iter_get_pages</code> turns the <code>struct iovec</code>s we feed into <code>vmsplice</code> into <code>struct page</code>s to put into the pipe. To understand what this function actually does, and how to speed it up, we must first take a detour into how the CPU and Linux organize pages.</p>

<div>
<p>As you might be aware of, processes do not refer to locations in RAM directly: instead, the are assigned <em>virtual</em> memory addresses, which get resolved to <em>physical</em> addresses. This abstraction is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory"><em>virtual memory</em></a>, and has all sorts of advantages we won’t cover here — the most obvious being that it significantly simplifies running multiple processes competing for the same physical memory.</p>
<p>In any case, whenever we execute a program and we load/store from/to memory, the CPU needs to convert our virtual address to a physical address. Storing a mapping from every virtual address to every corresponding physical address would be impratical. Therefore memory is split up in uniformly sized chunks, called <em>pages</em>, and virtual pages are mapped to physical pages:<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="https://mazzo.li/assets/images/virtual-phsyical.svg"></p>
<p>There’s nothing special about 4KiB: each architecture picks a size, based on various tradeoffs — some of which we’ll soon explore.</p>
<p>To make this a bit more precise, let’s imagine allocating 10000 bytes using <code>malloc</code>:</p>

<div>
<p>One of the tasks of the kernel is to manage this mapping, which is embodied in a data structure called the <em>page table</em>. The CPU specifies how the page table looks (since it needs to understand it), and the kernel manipulates it as needed. On x86-64 the page table is a 4-level, 512-way tree, which itself lives in memory.<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Each node of this tree is (you guessed it!) 4KiB wide, with each entry within the node leading to the next level being 8 bytes (4KiB/8bytes = 512). The entries contain the address of the next node, along with other metadata.</p>
<p>We have one page table per process — or in other words, each process has a reserved virtual address space. When the kernel context-switches to a process, it sets the special register CR3 to the <em>physical</em> address of the root of this tree.<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Then whenever a virtual address needs to be converted to a physical address, the CPU splits up the address in sections, and uses them to walk this tree and compute the physical address.</p>
<p>To make these concepts less abstract, here’s a visual depiction of how the virtual address <code>0x0000f2705af953c0</code> might be resolved to a physical address:</p>

<p><code>struct iov_iter</code> is a Linux kernel data structure representing various ways of walking through chunks of memory, including <code>struct iovec</code>. In our case, it will point to a 128KiB buffer. <code>vmsplice</code> will use <code>iov_iter_get_pages</code> to turn the input buffer into a bunch of <code>struct page</code>s, and hold on to them. Now that you know how paging works, you might vaguely imagine how <code>iov_iter_get_pages</code> works as well, but we’ll explain it in detail in the next section.</p>
<p>We’ve rapidly gone through a lot of new concepts, so to recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern CPUs use virtual memory for their processes;</li>
<li>Memory is organized in regularly-sized pages;</li>
<li>The CPU translates virtual addresses into physical addresses using a page table mapping virtual pages to physical pages;</li>
<li>The kernel adds and removes entries to the page table as necessary;</li>
<li>Pipes are made out of references to physical pages, so <code>vmsplice</code> must convert virtual memory ranges into physical pages, and hold on to them.</li>

<p>Here “user” (as opposed to “kernel”) refers to the fact that we’re turning virtual pages into references to physical pages.</p>
<p>To get our <code>struct page</code>s, <code>get_user_pages_fast</code> does exactly what the CPU would do, but in software: it walks the page table to collect all the physical pages, storing the results in <code>struct page</code>s. In our case, we have a 128KiB buffer, and 4KiB pages, so we’ll have <code>nr_pages = 32</code>.<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <code>get_user_pages_fast</code> will need to walk the page table tree collecting 32 leaves, and storing the result in 32 <code>struct page</code>s.</p>
<p><code>get_user_pages_fast</code> also needs to make sure that the physical page is not repurposed until the caller doesn’t need it anymore. This is achieved in the kernel using a reference count <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/f443e374ae131c168a065ea1748feac6b2e76613/include/linux/mm_types.h#L187">stored in <code>struct page</code></a>, which is used to know when a physical page can be released and repurposed in the future. The caller of <code>get_user_pages_fast</code> must, at some point, release the pages again with <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/f443e374ae131c168a065ea1748feac6b2e76613/include/linux/mm.h#L1222"><code>put_page</code></a>, which will decrease the reference count.</p>
<p>Finally, <code>get_user_pages_fast</code> behaves differently depending on whether virtual addresses are already in the page table. This is where the <code>_fast</code> suffix comes from: the kernel will first try to get an already existing page table entry and corresponding <code>struct page</code> by just walking the page table, which is relatively cheap, and fall back to producing a <code>struct page</code> by other, more expensive means otherwise. The fact that we <code>memset</code> the memory at the beginning will ensure that we never end up in the “slow” path of <code>get_user_pages_fast</code>, since the page table entries will be created as our buffer is filled with <code>'X'</code>s.<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Note that the <code>get_user_pages</code> family of functions is not only useful for pipes — in fact, it is central in many drivers. A typical use is related to the kernel bypass we mentioned: a driver for a network card might use it to turn some user memory region into a physical page, then communicate the physical page location to the network card, and have the network card interact directly with that memory region without kernel involvement.</p>
</div>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<ol start="18">
<li id="fn18" role="doc-endnote"><p>Actually, the pipe code <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/f443e374ae131c168a065ea1748feac6b2e76613/fs/splice.c#L1174">happens to always call <code>get_user_pages_fast</code> with <code>nr_pages = 16</code></a>, looping if necessary, presumably so that a small static buffer can be used. But it is an implementation detail, and the total number of spliced pages will still be 32.<a href="#fnref18" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn19" role="doc-endnote"><p>Subtleties follow, not needed to understand the rest of the post!</p>
<p>If the page table does not contain the entry we’re looking for, <code>get_user_pages_fast</code> still needs to return a <code>struct page</code>. The most obvious way to do so would be to create the right page table entry, and then return the corresponding <code>struct page</code>.</p>
<p>However <code>get_user_pages_fast</code> will only do so if it’s asked to get <code>struct page</code> for the purpose of writing into it. Otherwise it will <em>not</em> update the page table, instead returning a <code>struct page</code> giving us a reference to a yet-to-be-allocated physical page. This is exactly what happens in the case of <code>vmsplice</code>, since we just need to produce a <code>struct page</code> for the purpose of filling the pipe, without actually writing any memory.</p>
<p>Or in other words, allocating the page is delayed until we actually need to. This saves allocating the physical page, but will cause the slow path of <code>get_user_pages_fast</code> to be called repeatedly if the page is never faulted in by other means.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we do <em>not</em> <code>memset</code> before, and therefore do not fault the pages into the page table “manually”, not only we would end up in the slow path the first time we call <code>get_user_pages_fast</code>, but also all successive invocations, resulting in a significant slowdown (25GiB/s rather than 30GiB/s):</p>
<pre><code>% ./write --write_with_vmsplice --dont_touch_pages | ./read --read_with_splice
25.0GiB/s, 256KiB buffer, 40960 iterations (10GiB piped)</code></pre>
<p>Moreover, this behavior does <em>not</em> manifest itself when using huge pages: in that case <code>get_user_pages_fast</code> <em>will</em> properly fault the pages in when the virtual memory range passed in would be backed by huge pages.</p>
<p>If this is all very confusing, don’t worry, <code>get_user_pages</code> and friends seem to be a very tricky corner of the kernel, <a href="https://lwn.net/Kernel/Index/#Memory_management-get_user_pages">even for</a> <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/f443e374ae131c168a065ea1748feac6b2e76613/Documentation/core-api/pin_user_pages.rst">kernel developers</a>.<a href="#fnref19" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<div>
<p>Up to now we’ve presented pages as always being of the same size — 4KiB on x86-64. However, many CPU architectures, including x86-64, include larger page sizes. In the case of x86-64, we not only have 4KiB pages (the “standard” size), but also 2MiB and even 1GiB pages (“huge” pages). In the rest of the post we’ll only deal with 2MiB huge pages, since 1GiB pages are fairly uncommon, and overkill for our task anyway.</p>

<p>The main advantage of huge pages is that bookkeeping is cheaper, since there’s fewer of them needed to cover the same amount of memory. Moreover other operations are cheaper too, such as resolving a virtual address to a physical address, since one level less of page table is needed: instead of having a 12-bit offset into the page, we’ll have a 21-bit offset, and one less page table level.</p>

<div>
<p>This relieves pressure on the parts of the CPUs that handle this conversion, leading to performance improvements in many circumstances.<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> However, in our case, the pressure is not on the hardware that walks the page table, but on its software counterpart which runs in the kernel.</p>
<p>On Linux, we can allocate a 2MiB huge page <a href="https://mazzo.li/posts/check-huge-page.html">in a variety of ways</a>, such as by allocating memory aligned to 2MiB and then using <code>madvise</code> to tell the kernel to use huge pages for the provided buffer:</p>
<div id="cb20"><pre><code><span id="cb20-1"><span>void</span><span>*</span> buf <span>=</span> aligned_alloc<span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>21</span><span>,</span> size<span>);</span></span>
<span id="cb20-2">madvise<span>(</span>buf<span>,</span> size<span>,</span> MADV_HUGEPAGE<span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Switching to huge pages in our program yields another ~50% improvement:</p>
<pre><code>% ./write --write_with_vmsplice --huge_page | ./read --read_with_splice
51.0GiB/s, 256KiB buffer, 40960 iterations (10GiB piped)</code></pre>
</div>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<ol start="21">
<li id="fn21" role="doc-endnote"><p>For instance, the CPU includes dedicated hardware to cache parts of the page table, the “translation lookaside buffer” (TLB). The TLB is flushed at every context switch (every time we change the contents of CR3).</p>
<p>Huge pages can significantly reduce TLB misses, since a single entry for a 2MiB page covers 512 times more memory compared to a 4KiB page.<a href="#fnref21" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<div>
<p>However, the reason for the improvements is not totally obvious. Naively, we might think that by using huge pages <code>struct page</code> will just refer to a 2MiB page, rather than 4KiB.</p>
<p>Sadly this is <em>not</em> the case: the kernel code assumes everywhere that a <code>struct page</code> refers to a page of the “standard” size for the current architecture. The way this works for huge pages (and in general for what Linux calls “compound pages”) is that a “head” <code>struct page</code> contains the actual information about the backing physical page, with successive “tail” pages just containing a pointer to the head page.</p>
<p>So to represent 2MiB huge page we’ll have 1 “head” <code>struct page</code>, and up to 511 “tail” <code>struct page</code>s. Or in the case of our 128KiB buffer, 31 tail <code>struct page</code>s:<a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="https://mazzo.li/assets/images/head-tail-pages.svg"></p>
<p>Even if we need all these <code>struct page</code>s, the code generating it ends up significantly faster. Instead of traversing the page table multiple times, once the first entry is found, the following <code>struct page</code>s can be <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/f443e374ae131c168a065ea1748feac6b2e76613/mm/gup.c#L2457">generated in a simple loop</a>. Hence the performance improvement!</p>
</div>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<ol start="22">
<li id="fn22" role="doc-endnote"><p>If you’re thinking “that’s horrible!”, you’re not alone.</p>
<p>Various efforts are underway to simplify and/or optimize this situation.</p>
<p>Recent kernels (from 5.17 onwards) <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/849538/">include a new type</a>, <code>struct folio</code>, identifying head pages explicitly. This reduces the need for checking whether a <code>struct page</code> is a head page or tail page at runtime, yielding performance improvements.</p>
<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/839737/">Other efforts</a> aim to outright remove the extra <code>struct page</code>s, although I’m not up to date on how that is going.<a href="#fnref22" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<h2 id="busy-loop">Busy looping <a href="#busy-loop">#</a></h2>
<p>We’re almost done, I promise! Let’s look at <code>perf</code> output once again:</p>
<pre><code>-   46.91%     0.38%  write    libc-2.33.so       [.] vmsplice
   - 46.84% vmsplice
      - 43.15% entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe
         - do_syscall_64
            - 41.80% __do_sys_vmsplice
               + 14.90% wait_for_space
               + 8.27% __wake_up_common_lock
                 4.40% add_to_pipe
               + 4.24% iov_iter_get_pages
               + 3.92% __mutex_lock.constprop.0
                 1.81% iov_iter_advance
               + 0.55% import_iovec
            + 0.76% syscall_exit_to_user_mode
        1.54% syscall_return_via_sysret
        1.49% __entry_text_start
</code></pre>
<p>We’re now spending a significant amount of time waiting for the pipe to be writeable (<code>wait_for_space</code>), and waking up readers which were waiting for the pipe to have content (<code>__wake_up_common_lock</code>).</p>
<p>To sidestep these synchronization costs, we can ask <code>vmsplice</code> to return if the pipe cannot be written to, and busy loop until it is — and the same when reading with <code>splice</code>:</p>
<div id="cb23"><pre><code><span id="cb23-1"><span>...</span></span>
<span id="cb23-2"><span>// SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK will cause `vmsplice` to return immediately</span></span>
<span id="cb23-3"><span>// if we can't write to the pipe, returning EAGAIN</span></span>
<span id="cb23-4"><span>ssize_t</span> ret <span>=</span> vmsplice<span>(</span>STDOUT_FILENO<span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span>bufvec<span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK<span>);</span></span>
<span id="cb23-5"><span>if</span> <span>(</span>ret <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> errno <span>==</span> EAGAIN<span>)</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb23-6">  <span>continue</span><span>;</span> <span>// busy loop if not ready to write</span></span>
<span id="cb23-7"><span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb23-8"><span>...</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>By busy looping we get another 25% performance increase:</p>
<pre><code>% ./write --write_with_vmsplice --huge_page --busy_loop | ./read --read_with_splice --busy_loop
62.5GiB/s, 256KiB buffer, 40960 iterations (10GiB piped)</code></pre>
<p>Obviously busy looping comes at the cost of fully occupying a CPU core waiting for <code>vmsplice</code> to be ready. But often this compromise is worth it, and in fact it is a common pattern for high-performance server applications: we trade off possibly wasteful CPU utilization for better latency and/or throughput.</p>
<p>In our case, this concludes our optimization journey for our little synthetic benchmark, from 3.5GiB/s to 65GiB/s.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts <a href="#closing-thoughts">#</a></h2>
<p>We’ve systematically improved the performance of our program by looking at the <code>perf</code> output and the Linux source. Pipes and splicing in particular aren’t really hot topics when it comes to high-performance programming, but the themes we’ve touched upon are: zero-copy operations, ring buffers, paging &amp; virtual memory, synchronization overhead.</p>
<p>There are some details and interesting topics I left out, but this blog post was already spiraling out of control and becoming too long:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the actual code, the buffers are allocated separatedly, to reduce page table contention by placing them in different page table entries (something that the FizzBuzz program also does).</p>
<p>Remember that when a page table entry is taken with <code>get_user_pages</code>, its refcount is increased, and decreased on <code>put_page</code>. If we use two page table entries for the two buffers, rather than one page table entry for both of them, we have less contention when modifying the refcount.</p></li>
<li><p>The tests are ran by pinning the <code>./write</code> and <code>./read</code> processes to two cores with <code>taskset</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The code in the repo contains many other options I played with, but did not end up talking about since they were irrelevant or not interesting enough.</p></li>
<li><p>The repo also contains <a href="https://github.com/bitonic/pipes-speed-test/blob/master/get-user-pages.cpp">a synthetic benchmark</a> for <code>get_user_pages_fast</code>, which can be used to measure exactly how much slower it runs with or without huge pages.</p></li>
<li><p>Splicing in general is a slightly dubious/<a href="https://dirtypipe.cm4all.com/">dangerous</a> concept, <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/896267/">which continues to annoy</a> to kernel developers.</p></li>

The company had sought — for the second time — to dismiss the lawsuit on technical legal grounds.</p><p>“It is well-documented that ink is not required in order to scan or to fax a document, and it is certainly possible to manufacture an all-in-one printer that scans or faxes when the device is out of ink,” the plaintiffs wrote in their complaint. “Indeed, HP designs its all-in-one printer products so they will not work without ink. Yet HP does not disclose this fact to consumers.”</p><p>The lawsuit charges that HP deliberately withholds this information from consumers to boost profits from the sale of expensive ink cartridges. </p><p>Color printers require four ink cartridges -- one black and a set of three cartridges in cyan, magenta and yellow for producing colors. Some will also refuse to print if one of the color cartridges is low, even in black-and-white mode.</p><p>HP declined to comment on the issue, citing the pending litigation. The company’s court filings in the case have generally not addressed the substance of the plaintiff’s allegations.</p><p>In early 2022, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman dismissed the complaint on legal grounds but did not address the lawsuit's claims. The judge allowed the plaintiffs to amend their claim and resubmit it. On Aug. 10, the judge largely rejected HP's request to dismiss the revised complaint, allowing the case to proceed.</p><p>All-in-one inkjet printers generally seem like a bargain compared to the cost of separate devices with scanning, copying and fax functions. For instance, HP currently sells its all-in-one OfficeJet Pro 8034e online for just $159. But its least expensive standalone scanner, the ScanJet Pro s2, lists for $369 — more than twice the cost of the multifunction printer. </p><p>Of course, only one of these devices requires printer ink. “Printer ink is wildly expensive,” Consumer Reports states in its current printer buying guide, noting that consumer ink costs can easily run more than $70 a year.</p><p>Worse, a significant amount of ink is never actually used to print documents because it's consumed by printer maintenance cycles. In 2018, Consumer Reports tested hundreds of all-in-one inkjet printers and found that, when used intermittently, many models delivered less than half of their ink to printed documents. A few managed no more than 20% to 30%.</p><p>HP isn't alone in facing such legal complaints. A different set of plaintiffs sued the U.S. unit of printer and camera maker Canon Inc. in 2021 for similarly handicapping its all-in-one printers without disclosure. The parties settled that case in late 2022. Terms were not disclosed. </p></article></div>]]></description>

Type into a little text box and a complex array of technologies—vast data centers, ravenous web crawlers, and stacks of algorithms that poke and parse a query—spring into action to serve you a simple set of relevant results.</p><p>At least, that’s the idea. The age of <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/">generative AI</a> threatens to sprinkle epistemological sand into the gears of web search by fooling algorithms designed for a time when the web was mostly written by humans.</p><p>Take what I learned this week about Claude Shannon, the brilliant mathematician and engineer known especially for his work on <a data-offer-url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory&quot;}" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">information theory</a> in the 1940s. Microsoft’s Bing search engine informed me that he had also foreseen the appearance of search algorithms, describing a 1948 research paper by Shannon called “A Short History of Searching” as “a seminal work in the field of computer science outlining the history of search algorithms and their evolution over time.”</p><p>Like a good AI tool, Bing also offers a few citations to show that it has checked its facts.</p><figure><p><span><p>Microsoft's Bing search engine served up this information about a research paper mathematician Claude Shannon never wrote as if it were true.</p>
</span><span>Microsoft via Will Knight</span></p></figure><p>There is just one big problem: Shannon did not write any such paper, and the citations offered by Bing consist of fabrications—or “hallucinations” in generative AI parlance—by two chatbots, <a data-offer-url="https://pi.ai/s/v49ubm6cg7yQcMaybKgST" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://pi.ai/s/v49ubm6cg7yQcMaybKgST&quot;}" href="https://pi.ai/s/v49ubm6cg7yQcMaybKgST" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pi from Inflection AI</a> and <a data-offer-url="https://poe.com/s/NP7t5G7oZVuz4mzdLVcp" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://poe.com/s/NP7t5G7oZVuz4mzdLVcp&quot;}" href="https://poe.com/s/NP7t5G7oZVuz4mzdLVcp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Claude from Anthropic</a>.</p><p>This generative-AI trap that caused Bing to offer up untruths was laid—purely by accident—by <a data-offer-url="https://danielsgriffin.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://danielsgriffin.com/&quot;}" href="https://danielsgriffin.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Daniel Griffin</a>, who recently finished a PhD on web search at UC Berkeley. In July he <a data-offer-url="https://danielsgriffin.com/weblinks/2023/07/05/a-short-history-of-searching.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://danielsgriffin.com/weblinks/2023/07/05/a-short-history-of-searching.html&quot;}" href="https://danielsgriffin.com/weblinks/2023/07/05/a-short-history-of-searching.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">posted the fabricated responses</a> from the bots on his blog. Griffin had instructed both bots, “Please summarize Claude E. Shannon’s ‘A Short History of Searching’ (1948)”. He thought it a nice example of the kind of query that brings out the worst in large language models, because it asks for information that is similar to existing text found in its training data, encouraging the models to make very confident statements. Shannon did write an incredibly <a href="https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf">important article</a> in 1948 titled “A Mathematical Theory of Communication,” which helped <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-claude-shannons-information-theory-invented-the-future-20201222/">lay the foundation</a> for the field of information theory.</p><p>Last week, Griffin discovered that his blog post and the links to these chatbot results had inadvertently poisoned Bing with false information. On a whim, he tried feeding the same question into Bing and discovered that the chatbot hallucinations he had induced were highlighted above the search results in the same way as facts drawn from Wikipedia might be. “It gives no indication to the user that several of these results are actually sending you straight to conversations people have with LLMs,” Griffin says. (Although WIRED could initially replicate the troubling Bing result, after an enquiry was made to Microsoft it appears to have been resolved.)</p><p>Griffin’s accidental experiment shows how the rush to deploy ChatGPT-style AI is tripping up even the companies most familiar with the technology. And how the flaws in these impressive systems can harm services that millions of people use every day.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>It may be difficult for search engines to automatically <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-spot-generative-ai-text-chatgpt/">detect AI-generated text</a>. But Microsoft could have implemented some basic safeguards, perhaps barring text drawn from chatbot transcripts from becoming a featured snippet or adding warnings that certain results or citations consist of text dreamt up by an algorithm. Griffin added a disclaimer to his blog post warning that the Shannon result was false, but Bing initially seemed to ignore it.</p><p>Although WIRED could initially replicate the troubling Bing result, it now appears to have been resolved. Caitlin Roulston, director of communications at Microsoft, says the company has adjusted Bing and regularly tweaks the search engine to stop it from showing low authority content. “There are circumstances where this may appear in search results—often because the user has expressed a clear intent to see that content or because the only content relevant to the search terms entered by the user happens to be low authority,” Roulston says. “We have developed a process for identifying these issues and are adjusting results accordingly.”</p></div><p><a data-offer-url="https://sils.unc.edu/people/faculty/profiles/Francesca-Tripodi" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://sils.unc.edu/people/faculty/profiles/Francesca-Tripodi&quot;}" href="https://sils.unc.edu/people/faculty/profiles/Francesca-Tripodi" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Francesca Tripodi</a>, an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who studies how search queries that produce few results, dubbed <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-google-and-the-cost-of-data-voids-during-a-pandemic/">data voids</a>, can be used to manipulate results, says large language models are affected by the same issue, because they are trained on web data and are more likely to hallucinate when an answer is absent from that training. Before long, Tripodi says, we may see people use AI-generated content to intentionally manipulate search results, a tactic Griffin’s accidental experiment suggests could be powerful. “You're going to increasingly see inaccuracies, but these inaccuracies can also be wielded and without that much computer savvy,” Tripodi says.</p><p>Even WIRED was able to try a bit of search subterfuge. I was able to get Pi to create a summary of a fake article of my own by inputting, “Summarize Will Knight’s article ‘Google’s Secret AI Project That Uses Cat Brains.’” Google did once famously develop an AI algorithm that <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/06/google-x-neural-network/">learned to recognize cats on YouTube</a>, which perhaps led the chatbot to find my request not too far a jump from its training data. Griffin added a link to the result on his blog; we’ll see if it too becomes elevated by Bing as a bizarre piece of alternative internet history.</p><p>The problem of search results becoming soured by AI content may get a lot worse as SEO pages, social media posts, and blog posts are increasingly made with help from AI. This may be just one example of generative AI eating itself like an algorithmic <a data-offer-url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros&quot;}" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ouroboros</a>.</p><p>Griffin says he hopes to see AI-powered search tools shake things up in the industry and spur <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-opened-a-new-era-in-search-microsoft-could-ruin-it/">wider choice for users</a>. But given the accidental trap he sprang on Bing and the way people rely so heavily on web search, he says “there's also some very real concerns.”</p><p>Given his “seminal work” on the subject, I think Shannon would almost certainly agree.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>The wait is over! Vivaldi on iOS has arrived.</p>



<p>At Vivaldi, we believe that your browser should adapt to you, not the other way around. Now we bring this experience to your iPhone and iPad.</p>



<p>Whether you’re a casual or an advanced user, you get the flexibility and versatility to browse the web your way with Vivaldi’s powerful features and unmatched levels of personalization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vivaldi on iOS has our distinctive look and feel with a set of built-in tools that includes Desktop-style tabs, Speed Dials, Panels, Notes, a Reading List, and a Tracker and Ad Blocker. And, of course, with the Sync functionality, we give you a secure way to take Vivaldi – and your browsing data&nbsp;– with you.</p>

<h2>Welcome to Vivaldi on iOS</h2>



<p>As in our <a href="https://vivaldi.com/desktop/">desktop</a> and <a href="https://vivaldi.com/android/">Android</a> versions, when you launch Vivaldi on iOS you start with <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-bookmarks/speed-dials-in-vivaldi-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-bookmarks/speed-dials-in-vivaldi-on-ios/">Speed Dials</a> – your favorite sites organized the way you like them.</p>



<p>Here’s how the interface will look when you open a new tab:</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="860" height="484" src="https://vivaldi.com/wp-content/uploads/860w_ios_Explainer-2.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>The unique interface of Vivaldi on iOS. Key functionality is just a tap away</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>At the bottom-left corner of the browser, you’ll find Panels, a quick way to access useful tools like <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-bookmarks/bookmarks-in-vivaldi-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-bookmarks/bookmarks-in-vivaldi-on-ios/">Bookmarks</a>, <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-panels/history-in-vivaldi-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-panels/history-in-vivaldi-on-ios/">History</a>, <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-panels/notes-in-vivaldi-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-panels/notes-in-vivaldi-on-ios/">Notes</a>, <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-browse/reading-list-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-browse/reading-list-on-ios/">Reading List</a>, and <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-browse/manage-downloads-in-vivaldi-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-browse/manage-downloads-in-vivaldi-on-ios/">Downloads</a>. To the right, the <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-browse/tabs-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-browse/tabs-on-ios/">Tab Switcher</a> lets you access regular, private, and synced tabs in addition to the trash can to retrieve recently closed tabs.</p>



<p>In the middle, you’ll find Search and buttons for moving back and forth in History.</p>



<p>The Address Bar lets you search using any installed <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-browse/search-the-web-with-vivaldi-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-browse/search-the-web-with-vivaldi-on-ios/">search engine</a> or find a bookmark in an instant. The Tab Bar with desktop-style tabs helps you view and switch between tabs easily.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Let’s get to the feature highlights and the unique ways in which you can browse on iOS:</p>



<h2>Experience a reimagined tab interface with Desktop-style Tabs</h2>



<p>In most browsers on mobile, it’s difficult to keep track of many open tabs. But in Vivaldi, we have made it easy for you to view the tabs that are open and also switch between them without the hassle. </p>



<p>We’ve integrated an elegant desktop-style Tab Bar in the UI by default. This makes our Tab Bar unconventional and gives the same look and feel as Vivaldi on the <a href="https://vivaldi.com/desktop/">desktop</a> and <a href="https://vivaldi.com/android/">Android</a>. This unique feature improves usability significantly.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="860" height="484" src="https://vivaldi.com/wp-content/uploads/860w_ios_Desktop-style-tab.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>Unique to Vivaldi, desktop-style real tabs help manage open tabs easily</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A gateway to Vivaldi’s unique tab interface, the <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-browse/tabs-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-browse/tabs-on-ios/">Tab Switcher</a> gives you the ability to find open, private, recently closed, or synced tabs. This functionality makes finding and managing tabs a breeze.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The number in the Tab Switcher button (at the right side of the toolbar) indicates, how many open tabs you have. With a long press, you can open a new or private tab, or close the active tab.</p>



<p>The active tab will be displayed with a border around the Tab thumbnail. With a tap on the thumbnail, you can switch to the selected Tab. It is also easy to share selected tabs with a friend, mark them as a <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-bookmarks/bookmarks-in-vivaldi-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-bookmarks/bookmarks-in-vivaldi-on-ios/">Bookmark</a>, or add them to your <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-browse/reading-list-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-browse/reading-list-on-ios/">Reading List</a> – all with a long press.</p>



<h2>Access sites faster with Speed Dials</h2>



<p>We give you the power to make the Start Page more personal, unlike other browsers. You’re the one who gets to decide how your Start Page looks, feels, and performs.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="860" height="484" src="https://vivaldi.com/wp-content/uploads/860w_ios_Speed-Dial.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>Customize Speed Dials with your favorite links</em> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>At the core of Vivaldi’s Start Page are Speed Dials, displaying thumbnail galleries of bookmarks. With <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-bookmarks/speed-dials-in-vivaldi-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-bookmarks/speed-dials-in-vivaldi-on-ios/">Speed Dials</a>, you can access your favorite sites quickly and organize which bookmarks should show on your new tab page.</p>



<p>Thumbnails are generated by default, but you can create and customize multiple Speed Dials for different scenarios or categories. And even organize and manage bookmarks into nested folders.</p>



<h2>Take Notes on the go</h2>



<p>Unique to Vivaldi, <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-panels/notes-in-vivaldi-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-panels/notes-in-vivaldi-on-ios/">built-in Notes</a> help you jot down ideas, to-dos, and inspirations while browsing. What is handy here is that when you highlight any text, one of the options that comes up is “Copy to note” at which the text gets copied into the Notes section of the browser.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="860" height="484" src="https://vivaldi.com/wp-content/uploads/860w_ios_Notes.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>Create notes as you browse and sync them between devices with the built-in&nbsp;Notes&nbsp;feature</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Plus, Notes can easily be synced between your phone, <a href="https://vivaldi.com/desktop/">desktop</a>, and <a href="https://vivaldi.com/android/automotive/">car</a>, so you can pick up where you left off.</p>



<h2>Never miss a good story with the Reading List</h2>



<p><a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-browse/reading-list-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-browse/reading-list-on-ios/">Reading List</a> lets you add web pages to keep it for later. It prevents endless tabs from accumulating on your Tab Bar/Tab Switcher and Bookmarks from being filled with entries you only need once.</p>






<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="860" height="484" src="https://vivaldi.com/wp-content/uploads/860w_ios_Reading-List.png" alt=""><figcaption>&nbsp;<em>Save pages that you want to read later with the built-in Reading List on Vivaldi on iOS</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>What’s great about having a Reading List is that it does not require an external app and you do not need to sign up for an account. Bonus – they can be synced on any device with Vivaldi.</p>



<h2>Sync browsing data, seamlessly and safely</h2>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="860" height="484" src="https://vivaldi.com/wp-content/uploads/860w_ios_Sync-2.png" alt=""></figure></div>


<p>You can <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-tools/sync-browser-data-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-tools/sync-browser-data-on-ios/">sync</a> your browsing data – Bookmarks, Speed Dials, saved passwords, autofill information, typed History, and Notes – securely between installations of Vivaldi and other devices with our end-to-end encryption. Vivaldi is available on <a href="https://vivaldi.com/desktop/">Desktop</a>, <a href="https://vivaldi.com/android/">Android</a>, and in <a href="https://vivaldi.com/android/automotive/">cars</a>.</p>



<p>No third-party servers – Vivaldi stores Sync data on its own servers in Iceland.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="860" height="484" src="https://vivaldi.com/wp-content/uploads/860w_ios_Sync.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>With the powerful Sync, synchronize data between different installations of Vivaldi on desktop, Android, and in cars</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<h2>Enjoy speed, without ads and trackers.</h2>



<p>Our <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-privacy/tracker-and-ad-blocker-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-privacy/tracker-and-ad-blocker-on-ios/">built-in Tracker and Ad Blocker</a> gives you the choice of how you want sites to display. We’ve always believed that what you want the sites to know about you should be your choice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Tracker Blocker protects you from web trackers that follow you around the web gathering your personal information. While blocking trackers provides enough protection, some of you prefer to block ads in addition to trackers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Tracker and Ad Blocker can be easily enabled for sites through the shield icon at the left end of the Address field or globally in Settings.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="860" height="484" src="https://vivaldi.com/wp-content/uploads/860w_ios_Ad-Tracker-Blocker-1.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>Browse privately and with speed with the built-in Tracker and Ad</em><em> blocker</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The shield icon indicates whether the Tracker and Ad blocker is active. It also helps to enable or disable blocking for specific sites if that’s what you prefer. You can further manage the blocking level per site from here (or from <em>Settings → Tracker and Ad blocker</em>).</p>



<p>For enhanced privacy, you can also keep your browsing history discreet using private tabs – searches, sites visited, cookies, and temporary files won’t be stored by Vivaldi.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="860" height="484" src="https://vivaldi.com/wp-content/uploads/860w_ios_Private-Tabs.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>For enhanced privacy, browse with private tabs </em></figcaption></figure></div>


<h2>Search and switch Search engines</h2>



<p>You can switch from one search engine to another instantly – another powerful feature that makes various search engines easily accessible.</p>



<p>We offer you several privacy-focused alternatives that protect you from surveillance and believe in the neutrality of search results.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="860" height="484" src="https://vivaldi.com/wp-content/uploads/860w_ios_Search-engine.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>Switch and perform search with a different search engine</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<h2>Make it personal with Custom App icons</h2>



<p>Are you looking to add some flair to your browsing? Now you can simply select a Custom App icon to reflect your style or mood.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="860" height="484" src="https://vivaldi.com/wp-content/uploads/860w_ios_Custom-icon.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>Get a personal touch with Custom App Icons</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>You can also add more Vivaldi to your home screen with a Vivaldi widget. The widgets let you quickly enter a private tab, search the web, and easily scan QR codes.</p>



<h2>Go big with Vivaldi on the iPad and its big screen</h2>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="860" height="484" src="https://vivaldi.com/wp-content/uploads/860w_ios_iPad.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>Vivaldi is designed perfectly for the big screen of an iPad with a unique interface</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A bigger screen opens up a lot of possibilities for how the app’s user interface (UI) is presented. That is why we have designed the browser’s functionality for larger mobile screens so that it suits iPads — and you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll find our distinctive Start Page with <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-bookmarks/speed-dials-in-vivaldi-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-bookmarks/speed-dials-in-vivaldi-on-ios/">Speed Dials</a> displaying thumbnail galleries of bookmarks. You can add multiple Speed Dials to your Start Page and use these to organize and collect links to your favorite web pages.</p>



<p>Panels now pop up on the left of the screen, just like Vivaldi’s default desktop configuration. With Panels, you can optimize the available screen space on your iPad. Other buttons like the Tab Switcher History back/forward are on the top of the screen.</p>



<p>Your go-to tools are within easy reach in the browser’s sidebar, and allow you to work with your <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-panels/history-in-vivaldi-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-panels/history-in-vivaldi-on-ios/">History</a>, <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-browse/manage-downloads-in-vivaldi-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-browse/manage-downloads-in-vivaldi-on-ios/">Downloads</a>, <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-bookmarks/bookmarks-in-vivaldi-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-bookmarks/bookmarks-in-vivaldi-on-ios/">Bookmarks</a>, <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-browse/reading-list-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-browse/reading-list-on-ios/">Reading List</a>, and <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-panels/notes-in-vivaldi-on-ios/" data-type="link" data-id="https://help.vivaldi.com/ios/ios-panels/notes-in-vivaldi-on-ios/">Notes</a> in split-screen with your main browser window.</p>



<p>Toggling the Panel on and off is as easy as tapping the panel button in the top-left corner of the location bar, allowing more screen space and facilitating efficient workflows.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="860" height="484" src="https://vivaldi.com/wp-content/uploads/860w_ios_iPad-Panel-1.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>A browser first – Panels are on the left side for more screen space</em></figcaption></figure></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>There is something wrong at Booking.com.</p><p>While its parent company has been making record profits – $1.3bn for the second quarter of 2023 alone – and its CEO and executives have been cashing in millions of dollars in shares this year, many of the people who helped Booking.com make that fortune claim to have not been paid since July, some say longer.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/01/booking-com-hotel-fees-unpaid-millions-technical-issue" data-link-name="in body link">Many Booking.com accommodation partners</a> from Australia to Europe to the Americas have faced silence from the company as they’ve chased payments for months while struggling to keep businesses afloat – particularly during the lucrative northern hemisphere peak summer season, when many guests were essentially staying free of charge, as Booking.com hadn’t passed on payments.</p><p>You don’t need me to tell you the full impact of this. You only have to read the comments posted on social media and websites referencing the holiday booking site.</p><figure id="63eff0d6-94db-4348-81dc-1c05e51fb270" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:4,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/01/booking-com-hotel-fees-unpaid-millions-technical-issue&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Travel website Booking.com leaves hoteliers thousands of dollars out of pocket&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;63eff0d6-94db-4348-81dc-1c05e51fb270&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:1,&quot;design&quot;:8}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>One of the most distressing stories is beneath a post about Booking.com’s investment in AI and cutting-edge technology by the company’s highly remunerated CEO, Glenn Fogel, on his LinkedIn page.</p><p>Many partners have complained directly to the CEO about Booking.com’s silence on late payments and staff’s lack of response to calls, emails and cases opened on the platform that are closed without being resolved.</p><p>“I am a widow raising a child on my own,” reads one post by a woman I have since confirmed is called Claudia Arnull. “Because l have not been paid properly since the end of June my credit history is ruined and all my savings have gone and l am now in so much debt there is nothing left to use. As of this moment all l have to feed my child is porridge.”</p><p>The post appears genuine – and is genuinely heartbreaking – and you would hope that it will be investigated by the company. After all, nobody knows exactly how many families have been left in similar positions, with stress over credit histories and depleted savings due to Booking.com’s inability to pay partners.</p><p>We know that it’s likely that hundreds or thousands of partners have been affected. It could be many many more. We can’t know for sure, because despite dozens of emails to Booking.com’s media relations and Booking Holding’s communications departments, questions as to how many partners were affected, were never answered.</p><p>The only Booking.com spokesperson to respond to me, from their UK press office, emailed a standard reply. The official response blames payment issues on a technical glitch resulting from a planned two-week July maintenance intended to secure and enhance the travel reservations platform.<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/01/booking-com-hotel-fees-unpaid-millions-technical-issue" data-link-name="in body link"> A similar statement was given to the Guardian</a> this week in which it said it understood “the frustration of the accommodation hosts and owners” and that the “system errors that affected the payments have now been corrected”.</p><p>A Booking.com market manager in south-east Asia admitted at a recent industry event that payment delays were caused by the installation of a new payment system. Staff salaries were also affected, she said, explaining it as a risk they had to take.</p><p>It’s hard for partners to get excited about new initiatives when Booking.com hasn’t paid them in months, which means they can’t pay staff or utilities, get laundry done, buy ingredients for guest breakfasts or pay loans or investors and have to borrow from family and friends.</p><p>I’ve heard scores of heartbreaking stories in Facebook groups and online forums in recent months as I’ve connected with other accommodation partners and affiliate partners like myself to share experiences and tips to getting paid. My own three-month-long journey in chasing payments only ended last week after a partner shared direct emails for Booking.com finance department heads. I was paid three days later without an explanation or an apology.</p><p>Booking.com has 90 million accommodation partners with lodgings listed on their platform. It’s worth noting that it’s not the big brand hotels or luxury resorts that have been affected – they take payments from guests and send commissions to Booking.com. It appears to be couples, families and individuals; the independent operators of smaller lodgings that might not have a credit card facility to accept payments, such as apartment rentals, cottages, villas, bed and breakfasts and rooms in homes.

<p>In 2009 a giant star 25 times more massive than the Sun simply…vanished. Okay, it wasn’t quite that simple. It underwent a period of brightening, increasing in luminosity to a million Suns, just as if it was ready to explode into a supernova. But then it faded rather than exploding. And when astronomers tried to see the star, using the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT), Hubble, and the Spitzer space telescope, they couldn’t see anything.</p>
<p>The star, known as N6946-BH1, is now considered a failed supernova. The BH1 in its name is due to the fact that astronomers think the star collapsed to become a black hole rather than triggering a supernova. But that has been conjecture. All we’ve known for sure is that it brightened for a time then grew too dim for our telescopes to observe. But that has changed, thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).</p>
<p>The new study, published on the <em>arXiv</em>, analyzes data gathered by JWST’s NIRCam and MIRI instruments. It shows a bright infrared source that appears to be a remnant dust shell surrounding the position of the original star. This would be consistent with material ejected from the star as it brightened rapidly. It could also be an infrared glow from material infalling into the black hole, though that seems less likely.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="345" src="https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/panel-1024x345.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/panel-1024x345.jpg 1024w, https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/panel-580x196.jpg 580w, https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/panel-250x84.jpg 250w, https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/panel-768x259.jpg 768w, https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/panel-1536x518.jpg 1536w, https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/panel-2048x691.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"><figcaption>Images of BH1 show three sources, not one. Credit: Beasor, et al</figcaption></figure>
<p>Surprisingly, the team also found not one remnant object, but three. This makes the failed supernova model less likely. Earlier observations of N6946-BH1 were a blend of these three sources since the resolution wasn’t high enough to distinguish them. So a more likely model is that the 2009 brightening was caused by a stellar merger. What appeared to be a bright massive star was a star system that brightened as two stars merged, then faded.</p>
<p>While the data leans toward the merger model, it can’t rule out the failed supernova model. And that makes our understanding of supernovae and stellar mass black holes more complicated. We know from black hole mergers observed by LIGO and other gravitational wave observatories that stellar-mass black holes exist and are relatively common. So some massive stars do become black holes. But whether they become supernovae first is still in question. Regular supernovae can have enough remnant mass to become a black hole, but it’s hard to imagine how the largest stellar black holes could have formed after supernovae.</p>
<p>N6946-BH1 is in a galaxy 22 million light-years away, so the fact that JWST can distinguish multiple sources is impressive. It also gives astronomers hope that similar stars will be observed in time. With more data, we should be able to distinguish between stellar mergers and true failed supernovae, which will help us understand the last stages of stars as they move toward becoming stellar-mass black holes.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Microsoft is to overhaul OneDrive in a move that will bring Copilot to the cloud storage service and herd users towards the tool's web interface.</p>
<p>In a presentation that combined both consumer and business editions of OneDrive, Microsoft <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-onedrive-blog/unveiling-the-next-generation-of-onedrive/ba-p/3935612">was keen to show off</a> OneDrive Home – the experience to be enjoyed by users of the the product's web interface.</p>
<p>For business customers, OneDrive Home is intended to be a portal into the user's files, wherever they might lurk in an organization. One slightly worrying panel on this interface is captioned "For You," and surfaces files that Microsoft's AI reckons will be of interest. One can but hope that administrators are on the ball sufficiently to ensure that nothing that shouldn't be there inadvertently pops up.</p>

    

<p>Other views include Meetings, showing upcoming and past meetings, along with files and recordings; People, which organizes files by the people a user works with; and Shared, which, as its name suggests, shows files shared with the user.</p>

        


        

<p>Users can also select colors for folders, flag favorites, or create shortcuts.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/09/21/handout_windows_copilot.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1" width="174" height="115" alt="Microsoft's Copilot logo"></p><h2 title="Windows gets its own Copilot to help operate the operating system – Edge, Bing, Outlook, 365 not spared, either">Beneath Microsoft's Surface event, AI spreads everywhere</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/21/microsoft_surface_ai_copilot/"><span>MORE CONTEXT</span></a></p></div>
<p>Microsoft floated the new design for work and school <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-onedrive-blog/experience-the-new-onedrive-fast-organized-and-personalized/ba-p/3804985">in May</a>, but it is the items flagged as coming soon that will pique the interest of customers, even with the inevitable mentions of AI and Copilot.</p>
<p>New features announced include the ability to fire up desktop apps from files in the browser interface via "Open-in-app" – due worldwide in December. This might be useful for some, but we suspect many would opt for the File Explorer incarnation of OneDrive to do the same thing.</p>
<p>While adding OneDrive into Teams and Outlook will be handy for customers keen to link files without having to jump interfaces – integration into the Windows Outlook app or the web version is due in December – the offline functionality is the most intriguing.</p>

        

<p>It is already possible to use desktop synchronization to keep some files always available and others in the cloud. Microsoft intends to bring this functionality to the browser and permit users to select files or folders to always be available locally via OneDrive for the Web. It also plans to allow users to open and work on files flagged for offline access in the browser without internet access.</p>

</ul>
<p>Rename, move, copy, and delete functionality will all be available to offline browser users, with changes synchronized when the internet connection is restored.</p>
<p>According to Microsoft, Files On-Demand for Web and Offline mode in the browser are due in early 2024.</p>
<p>Inevitably, Copilot skills are due to arrive in OneDrive. Microsoft hopes these will help users find files and stay organized. Worryingly, in the example given, Copilot can move files around and create folders depending on its interpretation of the user's instructions. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<div>
<h2 title="Teams gets a bot, OneNote gets a bot, PowerPoint gets a bot, Outlook gets a bot, everybody* gets a bot!">Microsoft can't stop injecting Copilot AI into every corner of its app empire</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/10/microsoft_copilot_ai/"><span>PREVIOUSLY</span></a></p></div>
<p>Copilot in OneDrive is due to turn up in December – although you'll need a Microsoft 365 Copilot license – for questions about individual files. The delivery date for the other new skills remains vague for now.</p>
<p>Finally, and more useful for users, security tools will arrive that restrict access to files, set conditional access policies at a granular level, and deal with moving OneDrive accounts across tenants. Plus, due in preview from January 2024, administration reports will be available as part of Microsoft Graph Data Connect for SharePoint.</p>
<p>Missing from the announcement was mention of a Linux client or any potential increase in storage. The company <a target="_blank" href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-onedrive-blog/experience-the-new-onedrive-fast-organized-and-personalized/ba-p/3804985">moved away from unlimited storage in 2015</a>, and for many users the only way to breach the 1TB OneDrive limit is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/09/25/microsoft_onedrive_storage_price/">to hand over more cash to Microsoft</a>. ®</p>

<p><span>Canalys EMEA Forum 2023</span> Lenovo is forecasting that the vast majority of its devices will be repairable by 2025 – as will the repair parts themselves – but it is not intending to specify where customers should have their kit fixed.</p>
<p>Talking on stage at the Canalys EMEA Forum 2023, Luca Rossi, senior vice resident at Lenovo and president of its Intelligent Devices Group, said the company has committed to a net zero emission policy by 2050, and analyzing the components used in its hardware is part of the equation.</p>

<p>"On repairability, we have a plan that by 2025 more than 80 percent of the repair parts will be repaired again so that they they enter into the circular economy to reduce the impact to the environment."</p>
<p>He added: "More than 80 percent of our devices will be able to be repaired at the customer, by the customer or by the channel and we are enabling this with a design for serviceability kind of approach."</p>
<p>This means that "batteries, SSD, many things, will not any longer be sealed into the product but will be available for the customer to be to repaired on site and then save a lot of waste."</p>

    

<p>The world's largest PC maker doesn't have a terrible reputation in terms of the ease at which its gadgets can be mended, unlike Apple. The ThinkPad T14 Gen 3, for example, was assigned a fixability score of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ifixit.com/repairability/laptop-scores">7 out of 10</a> by Fixit; and the Framework 13 got top marks.</p>

        


        

<p>Lenovo and other vendors aren't going to make hardware easier to fix out of the goodness of their own hearts: the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/21/right_to_repair/">European Council last month started to update EU rules</a> to ensure consumers are better informed about the lifespan and repairability of the tech devices they buy. The requirements should be finalized before June next year.</p>

<p>Yet won't easing repairability hit Lenovo in the pocket as consumers and businesses, in theory at least, get a simpler solution to keep their devices running for longer? Canalys CEO Steve Brazier put this question to Rossi on stage.</p>
<p>"I think you cannot you cannot look at this in this way," he said, adding the future looks very rosy for tech companies. "There are so many opportunities that frankly thinking I'm not worried that we will damage our business by doing what is right for the planet. Not at all." ®</p>

   <p><img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/AB12_15_05copy.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">This is my street-legal jet car on full afterburner.  The car has two engines: the production gasoline engine in the front driving the front wheels and the jet engine in the back.  The idea is that you drive around legally on the gasoline engine and when you want to have some fun, you spin up the jet and get on the burner (you can start the jet while driving along on the gasoline engine).  The car was built because I wanted the wildest street-legal ride possible.  With this project, I was able to use some stuff I learned while getting my fancy engineering degree (I have a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University) to design a street-legal jet car without the distraction of how other people have done it in the past - because no one has.  I don't know how fast the car will go and probably never will.  The car was built to thrill me, not kill me.  That doesn't stop me from the occasional blast on the highway though.
   </span></p><p>
   <img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_Rear_Pa1_PScopy.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">The car is licensed here in California.  In California, new cars have bi-annual smog inspections so if you modify the engine, it is likely to fail the inspection and you won't be able to drive it on the street.  There are some exempt engine modifications (ex. after-cat mufflers - big deal) but none that will allow you to add 1350 hp to a new car.
   </span>
   <img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_Side1_PScopy.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">Car was built to look as if VW delivered the car this way.  It handles fine and is safe.  I was thinking of putting it into an import car show but the promoter told me that it looked too plain and recommended that I put some decals on it, lower it, and put on some aftermarket wheels.  Sure kid, put on some flimsy wheels won't take a curb and don't center on the hubs, lower the car so the tires rub and get cut by the body using springs that bounce me all over the road, and advertise for companies that couldn't engineer themselves out of a paper bag.  I would have thought the 14" diameter tailpipe was enough for him but I guess it wasn't.  Response from the hot rod magazines has been slow.  One editor told me that is because I didn't use anything they advertise.  But the response to driving it on the street and going to the hot rod shows (San Francisco Custom Car Show, Grand National Roadster Show in Pomona, and the Detroit Autorama) has been fantastic.  This car attracts crowds better than any '32 Ford, '69 Camaro, or decaled Honda.
   </span>
   <img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_Rear_Dr1_PScopy.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">The Beetle was chosen because it looks cool with the jet and it shows it off well.  Remember the Hurst wheelstanding Barracuda "Hemi Under Glass"?  Well, this is "Jet Under Glass".  Air for the jet enters the car through the two side windows and the sunroof.  It's a little windy inside but not unbearable.

The "hatch not closed" warning light works too.

All fixed and reinforced now.  The heat blanket keeps the plastic bumper from melting when the jet is operating.
   </span><img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_BackDash1_PScopy.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">The back of the gauge panel was kept open to give the car a techie look.  Something to talk about.  The car's an engineering device, let's see some engineering thingies.  The aluminum panel was designed in SolidWorks and cut out of billet, bead blasted, clear annodized, and then the labels for the switches were milled into the front using a font matching the VW cluster.  Little details like the holes having flat sides so the switches don't spin and exactly matching the contour of the dash added time to the project.  Several versions were made out of styrofoam first to get the layout and lighting right.  From the back, the panel reminds me of the 1970s McLaren CanAm cars.
   </span><img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_Back_Pa_Window1_PScopy.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">The first thing I did when I got the car was to cut the hole in the back for the engine.  Made a fancy jig out of a tripod, a rod, and a lawnmower wheel to mark out the cut and went at it with a pneumatic saw.  Then finished it off with jeweler's files.  No paint required.  Didn't even chip.  The hole was tricky because it goes through 3 layers (bumper and two layers of metal) and it's a circle projected onto angled surfaces.   Just finding the centerline of the car wasn't trivial.  Worrying what my neighbors would say if I ruined the back of a brand-new car made me REAL careful.  I believe the hole is within 2 mm.
   </span><img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_Dash_Pa1_PScopy.jpg" width="600" height="800"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">There are three gauges for the jet: %RPM, Oil Pressure, and Turbine Inlet Temperature.  The most important is turbine inlet temperature.  If you exceed about 650 degrees C for very long, you damage the engine.  This is critical on start-up.  You don't want a "hot-start".  The throttle for the jet engine is located next to the gear selector.  It is a lever and has three buttons: Cool, Big-Fire, and Afterburner.  "Cool" leans out the engine and is used to lower the turbine inlet temperature if you get a hot-start.  To light big-fire or the afterburner, you hold a button down and 1/2 second later, press the hot-streak button on the floor.  Then things happen!  Notice the kerosene level gauge in front of the gear selector (jet fuel is mostly kerosene) and the bud vase missing a rose.  Where did it go?

<img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_FUBB_PScopy.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">Lotsa stuff back here.  The force from the jet is tied to the vehicle through sandwich plates inside the car bolted to contoured aluminum billets that were slid into the frame rails.  You can see the billet on the left side with a hole in its center, welded to the plate with 4 bolts.  Used helium as the inert gas and a lot of current to weld that chunk of aluminum.  To return the car to its production height, adjustable spring perches were used.  Same spring rate, just corrected the ride height.  Drives and handles fine.  Kerosene is stored in a custom 14 gallon, baffled, foam-filled kevlar fuel cell in the spare tire well.  Two fuel exits in the back: a -12 on the left side and a -10 on the right.  The -10 goes to a shutoff, then a Barry Grant pump (one of the few hot rod parts on the car), then up into the car where it sees a filter, a regulator, and an electrical shutoff valve before feeding the engine.  The -12 goes into a shutoff, then a 1.5 hp, 11,000 rpm, 24V custom electric pump.   Pump is magnesium and can maintain 100 psi at 550 gph.  From the pump it goes into the car to a filter, then a large regulator, and then to the afterburner solenoid and the big-fire solenoid (to left of pump and feeding bottom of tailpipe through orange covered hose).  Fuel system was tested for flow capability.  Above the big pump you can see the relocated gasoline cap actuator and all that black stuff on the right side is the stock fuel evaporative control equipment.  All circuits feeding solenoids and pumps have fuses, relays, kick-back diodes to minimize contact arcing, sealed connectors, and use automotive wires of a gauge giving a maximum of 1V drop over the circuit loop.
</span><img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_Engine_Dr1_PScopy.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">The engine is a General Electric Model T58-8F.  This is a helicopter turboshaft engine that was converted to a jet engine by some internal modifications and a custom tailpipe.  The engine spins up to 26,000 RPM (idle is 13,000 RPM), draws air at 11,000 CFM, and is rated at 1350 hp.  It weighs only 300 lbm.  It grows as it warms up so the engine mounts have to account for this.  The mounts in the front are rubber and the back are sliding mounts on rubber.  The structure holding the engine was designed using finite element analysis and is redundant.  Strong, damage tolerant, and light.  Second battery and fuse/relay panel on the right, halon fire system and 5 gallon dry sump tank on left.  24V starter motor is in the nose of the engine.  700 A of current goes into that motor for 20 seconds during start-up.  Due to heat, must limit starts to three in one hour.  Big screen is to avoid FOD (foreign object damage).  Jet keeps sucking the rose out of the bud vase on the dash!
</span><img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_Fire_Ext1_PScopy.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">A lot of attention to details in the car.  Note the aluminum block holding/protecting the halon gas line, pull line, harness to engine, and oil pressure line.  Rectangular tank under inlet screen is for various fuel drains.  Note temperature gauge and shutoff valve for dry sump tank.  3 gallons of turbine oil at $25/quart (ouch!).  Two-stage PPG paint matching exterior of car was used inside the car.  It is not easy to paint around a lot of bars, etc while crouched in a car, in your dusty home garage, avoiding drips, and with your wife screaming that the fumes will cause brain damage in the kids.  Especially with two-stage where you have multiple coats and critical drying times.  Kids passed their grades so I guess damage was minimal, but more importantly, the paint turned out great!
</span><img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_Fire1copy.jpg" width="800" height="494"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">Street racing action.  The other guy wimped out after a few "big-fire" demonstrations.  What you see in the picture is about one-twentieth the full size of the fireball.  Guy standing beside car had never seen it run before and was smiling ear-to-ear throughout the show.  Had I launched, I would have burned him to a crisp.  Well, live and learn.
</span><img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_BUS1PScopy.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">We get this a lot.  A police officer picking at his nose while trying to figure out what to charge me with.  Notice the hopeful anticipation of us on the right.  We're rooting for him and offer suggestions but unfortunately, the California Department of Motor Vehicles did not anticipate such a vehicle so he's out of luck.  Hmmm, the car has two engines making the car a hybrid so maybe we can drive in the commuter lanes along with the Toyota Priuses.
<p>*** Update 7/18/06 *** You have to give the California Department of Motor Vehicles (the DMV) credit for 
creativity on this one.� A DMV insider has disclosed to me that the DMV has 
made a formal request to a federal agency to rule if my Beetle constitutes a 
threat to national security based on what could happen if it got into the wrong 
hands. �This raises three questions in my mind: #1 Does this mean I�m the 
right hands?� #2 If someone with the name "b_laden13" is the highest eBay 
bidder for my Beetle can I refuse his offer even if he has the prestigious eBay 
Red Shooting Star feedback rating (the highest)? �#3 Would this affect my 
eBay rating?</p></span>

<img src="https://www.ronpatrickstuff.com/images/VW_Repair1_PScopy.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p><p><span size="5" color="White">The car was built in this garage.  Paint, welding, everything except some mill work.  That's me standing beside the engine that is out of the car for some fuel controller work.  The orange line is for the afterburner.  There's one on the other side too.  Here you can make out the four rows of variable inlets/stators at the front of the engine.  Their angle changes with engine speed and are used to avoid compressor stall.  There are 11 compressor stages and 2 turbine stages.  The engine's pressure ratio is 8.3:1.  That's how you work on a jet engine.  Stick it on its end.  Easy to store them that way too.

She wants it to go faster than 40 mph.  So I have these two little JFS 100 jet engines and I am thinking how to put them on the scooter.  Engines are 50 lbm each so weight is an issue.  Will probably use air-start with a carbon fiber tank of compressed air.  That saves weight since batteries will then not be needed.

On one jet engine alone, this engine will get a kart up to 60 mph.  Looks like I have a lot of spare wire left over from the Beetle job to do the scooter.

  <p>This week I was in Rotterdam for <a href="https://ripe86.ripe.net/">a RIPE meeting</a>.
On Friday morning I gave a lightning talk called <a href="https://ripe86.ripe.net/archives/video/1126/">where does my
computer get the time from?</a>
The RIPE meeting website has a copy of my slides and a video of the talk;
this is a blogified version, not an exact transcript.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote a follow-up note, <a href="https://dotat.at/@/2023-05-28-whence-whence-time.html">“Where does ‘where does my computer get
the time from?’ come from?”</a> about some things I left
out of the talk.</p>

<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.001.jpeg" alt="Where does my computer get the time from?"></p>
<p>Where does my computer get the time from?</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.002.jpeg" alt="from NTP"></p>
<p>from NTP - here’s a picture of an NTP packet</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.003.jpeg" alt="David Mills surrounded by clocks"></p>
<p>and here’s a picture of David Mills who invented NTP</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.004.jpeg" alt="Where does my computer get the time from? NTP"></p>
<p>simple question, easy answer, end of talk? No!</p>
<p>let’s peel off some layers…</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.005.jpeg" alt="Where does NTP get the time from? NTP"></p>
<p>stratum 3 NTP servers get the time from stratum 2 NTP servers,</p>
<p>stratum 2 NTP servers get the time from stratum 1 NTP servers,</p>
<p>stratum 1 NTP servers get the time from some reference clock</p>
<p>maybe a radio signal such as MSF in Britain or DCF77 in Germany</p>
<p>but in most cases the reference clock is probably a GPS receiver</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.006.jpeg" alt="Where does NTP get the time from? GPS"></p>
<p>here’s a GPS timing receiver</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.007.jpeg" alt="Where does NTP get the time from? GPS"></p>
<p>and here’s a GPS satellite</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.008.jpeg" alt="Where does GPS get the time from?"></p>
<p>where does GPS get the time from?</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.009.jpeg" alt="Schriever space force base entrance sign"></p>
<p>Schriever Space Force Base in Colorado</p>
<p>they look after a lot of different top secret satellites and other
stuff at Schriever, as you can see from all the mission logos</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.010.jpeg" alt="Schriever space force base aerial photo"></p>
<p>so you can’t get close enough to take a nice photo</p>

<p>Where does Schriever SFB get the time from?</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.012.jpeg" alt="racks of time-keeping equipment with smart blue blanking panels"></p>
<p>the US Naval Observatory Alternate Master Clock
is on site at Schriever in Colorado</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.013.jpeg" alt="the USNO main building"></p>
<p>the US Naval Observatory Alternate Master Clock
gets the time from the US Naval Observatory in Washington DC</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.014.jpeg" alt="where does the USNO get the time from?"></p>
<p>there are three answers</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.015.jpeg" alt="USNO atomic clocks"></p>
<p>the first answer is atomic clocks, lots of atomic clocks</p>
<p>in the background there are dozens of rack mounted caesium beam clocks</p>
<p>in the foreground the black boxes house hydrogen masers</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.016.jpeg" alt="more USNO atomic clocks"></p>
<p>these shiny cylinders are <a href="https://www.cnmoc.usff.navy.mil/Our-Commands/United-States-Naval-Observatory/Precise-Time-Department/The-USNO-Master-Clock/The-USNO-Master-Clock/Rubidium-Fountain-Clocks/">rubidium fountains</a></p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.017.jpeg" alt="aerial photograph of the USNO campus, which is a perfect circle"></p>
<p>the USNO has so many atomic clocks they have entire buildings dedicated to them</p>
<p>When I was preparing this talk I noticed on Apple Maps that there’s a
huge building site in the middle of the USNO campus. It turns out they
are building a fancy new clock house; the main limit on the accuracy
of their clocks is environmental stability: temperature, humidity,
etc. so the new building will have serious air handling.</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.018.jpeg" alt="where does the USNO get the time from?"></p>
<p>the second answer is that UTC is a horrible compromise between time
from atomic clocks and time from earth rotation</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.019.jpeg" alt="the Paris observatory"></p>
<p>so the USNO gets the time from the international earth rotation
service, which is based at the Paris Observatory</p>
<p>twice a year the IERS sends out
<a href="https://datacenter.iers.org/availableVersions.php?id=16">Bulletin C</a>,
which says whether or not there will be a leap second in six months
time; leap seconds are added (or maybe removed) from UTC to keep it in
sync with earth rotation</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.020.jpeg" alt="where does the IERS get the time from?"></p>
<p>the IERS is spread across several organizations which contribute
to its scientific work</p>
<p>for example, you can subscribe to <a href="https://datacenter.iers.org/availableVersions.php?id=6">IERS Bulletin A</a>,
which is a weekly notice with precise details of the earth orientation parameters</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.021.jpeg" alt="the USNO main building"></p>
<p>Bulletin A is sent out by the US Naval observatory</p>
<p>they need to know the exact orientation of the earth under the GPS
satellites, so they can provide precise positioning</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.022.jpeg" alt="where does the USNO get the time from?"></p>
<p>the third answer is, how does the USNO know its atomic clocks are working well?</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.023.jpeg" alt="the pavillion de breteuil"></p>
<p>that information comes from the international bureau of weights and
measures in Paris, who maintain the global standard UTC</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.024.jpeg" alt="where does the BIPM get the time from?"></p>
<p>how does the BIPM determine what UTC is?</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.025.jpeg" alt="Circular T"></p>
<p>the BIPM collects time measurements from national timing laboratories
around the world, and uses those measurements to determine official
UTC</p>
<p>periodically they send out <a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/time-ftp/circular-t">Circular T</a>
which has information about the discrepencies between official UTC and
UTC from the various national time labs</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.026.jpeg" alt="diagram of the new SI"></p>
<p>the BIPM is responsible for maintaining the international system of
units, which is defined by the general conference on weights and
measures</p>
<p>the CGPM is an international treaty organization established by the
metre convention of 1875</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.027.jpeg" alt="diagram of the SI highlighting the second"></p>
<p>UTC is an implementation of the SI unit of time, based on quantum
measurements of caesium atoms</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.028.jpeg" alt="where did the CGPM get the time from?"></p>
<p>where did this magic number, about 9.2 GHz, come from?</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.029.jpeg" alt="Essen and Parry standing next to their atomic clock"></p>
<p>in 1955, Louis Essen (on the right) and Jack Parry (left) built
the first caesium atomic clock</p>
<p>the current definition of the second came from the calibration of this clock</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.030.jpeg" alt="where did Essen and Parry get the time from?"></p>
<p>before atomic clocks, the definition of the second was based on
astronomy, so Essen and Parry needed help from astronomers to find out
how fast their clock ticks according to the existing standard of time</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.031.jpeg" alt="the USNO main building"></p>
<p>they got help from the astronomers at the US Naval Observatory</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.032.jpeg" alt="Markowitz and Essen"></p>
<p>the way it worked was William Markowitz measured time by looking at
the skies, and Louis Essen measured time by looking at his atomic
clock, and to correlate their measurements, they both listened to the
WWV radio time signal broadcast by the national bureau of standards in
Washington DC</p>
<p>this project took 3 years, 1955 - 1958</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.033.jpeg" alt="where did Markowitz get the time from?"></p>
<p>Markowitz was measuring the “ephemeris second”</p>
<p>in 1952 the international astronomical union changed the definition of
time so that instead of being based on the rotation of the earth about
its axis, it was based on the orbit of the earth around the sun</p>
<p>in the 1930s they had discovered that the earth’s rotation is not
perfectly even: it slows down and speeds up slightly</p>
<p>clocks were now more precise than the rotation of the earth, so the
ephemeris second was a new more precise standard of time</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.034.jpeg" alt="where did the IAU get the time from?"></p>
<p>the ephemeris second is based on an astronomical ephemeris, which is a
mathematical model of the solar system</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.035.jpeg" alt="tables of the motion of the earth on its axis and around the sun"></p>
<p>the standard ephemeris was produced by Simon Newcomb in the late 1800s</p>
<p>he collected a vast amount of historical astronomical data to create
his mathematical model</p>
<p>it remained the standard until the mid 1980s</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.036.jpeg" alt="Simon Newcomb"></p>
<p>here’s a picture of Simon Newcomb</p>
<p>he is a fine-looking Victorian gentleman</p>
<p>where did he work?</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.037.jpeg" alt="the USNO main building"></p>
<p>at the US naval observatory!</p>
<p>(and the US nautical almanac office)</p>
<p><img src="https://dotat.at/@/2023-04-whence-time.038.jpeg" alt="the Royal Greenwich Observatory"></p>
<p>I have now run out of layers: before this point, clocks were set more
straightforwardly by watching stars cross the sky</p>
<p>so, to summarise my talk, where does my computer get the time from?</p>
<p>it does <em>not</em> get it from the Royal Greenwich Observatory!</p>

                        <p><strong>Discover new ways to optimize database performance and avoid common mistakes that impact latency and throughput</strong></p>
<p>So many things have to align perfectly for impressive database performance. You need to think hard about factors like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The infrastructure your database sits on</li>
<li>How it’s set up</li>
<li>How you’re managing it</li>
<li>How your application interacts with the driver</li>
<li>How the driver interacts with your database</li>
<li>How that database is designed</li>
<li>How well its approach aligns with your specific workload characteristics and requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s just scratching the surface. Behind each of those elements, there’s likely years of engineering efforts from the database side – not to mention all the user-side strategizing, trial-and-error optimization, and high-pressure triaging.</p>
<p>Most teams don’t have that level of time and patience. They need performance, and they want it now.</p>

<p>The complete 270-page book is available now, for free.</p>
<p>Here are a few important things to note…</p>
<h2>It’s not “about” ScyllaDB – but it’s highly relevant for anyone using or considering it</h2>
<p>While this book was written by people who have been working at ScyllaDB, it’s not a book “about” ScyllaDB per se. The authors wanted to explore the topic of database performance at a broader level so the book would be relevant even beyond the ScyllaDB community. It doesn’t matter what database you’re currently using (MongoDB, MySQL, Postgres, Cassandra, DynamoDB…). If you’re experiencing some pain related to database latency and/or throughput – or you fear you will suffer soon – this is a book for you.</p>
<p>If you’re considering or already using ScyllaDB, you’ll definitely want to look at this book. It features the collective wisdom of teams who develop ScyllaDB and guide our customers through their most complex challenges. And if you want to discuss these topics in relation to your specific use case, we’d be happy to chat more – <a href="https://www.scylladb.com/company/contact-us/">just contact us</a>.</p>
<p>Also, if you are interested in a book specifically about ScyllaDB, stay tuned to our social media handles. There will be some exciting news on that front quite soon. 😉</p>
<h2>It’s highly opinionated</h2>
<p>When ScyllaDB started working with Discord 5 years ago, one of the things they appreciated most was “<a href="https://www.scylladb.com/2019/03/20/discord-on-the-joy-of-opinionated-systems/">the joy of opinionated systems</a>.” In other words, “people who are good stewards of the system have already figured out what is important.”</p>
<p>This opinionated approach is a hallmark of the <em>Database Performance at Scale</em> book. Whether explaining a performance-critical decision that a database user will likely face or sharing the rationale behind various engineering optimizations, the authors present their perspective on the associated tradeoffs, along with their recommendations on what’s best from the perspective of performance.</p>
<h2>It’s free, it’s open source… and it’s fun</h2>
<p>The authors, and all the engineers throughout both <a href="https://www.scylladb.com/">ScyllaDB</a> and <a href="https://turso.tech/">Turso</a>, are avid open source supporters and contributors. When presented with the opportunity to write a book, everyone agreed that taking an “open source” approach would be the best way to make the finished product readily accessible to all interested readers.</p>

It's typical and expected that microwave ovens will cause some interference with other users of the 2.4GHz ISM band that are very nearby. Microwaves operate at very high power levels and are required to be shielded for human safety, but the permissible leakage power is relatively high compared to typical WiFi and Bluetooth devices---there's a simple reason why. From a legal perspective, Bluetooth is essentially pretending to be a microwave oven and making use of the permitted leakage power.<p>This is the cost of the historical regulatory situation that most of these unlicensed radio services use the ISM bands originally allocated for microwave heating. One of the advantages of newer WiFI standards, particularly WiFi 6E, is that they finally change this situation by using the U-NII bands allocated specifically for unlicensed short-range digital communications, rather than for microwave heating.</p><p>Mind that this is all in the context of US spectrum regulations, although other countries have largely harmonized their approach.

A number of ISM bands were allocated for RF heating applications originally, 6.78MHz, 13.560MHz, 27.12MHz, 40.68MHz, 915MHz (commonly referred to as 900MHz), 2.45GHz (commonly referred to as 2.4GHz), 61.25GHz, 122.5GHz. These are just examples taken from my NTIA chart which doesn't call all of them out.<p>The lower ones are largely historic, the very first RF heating experiments used HF and VHF low band which were easier to produce with the radio transmitter technology of the time, but not very efficient at all. The invention of the magnetron changed that, suddenly it was much easier to produce microwave radiation at high power levels, and so the inefficient HF/VHF RF heating devices have all but faded away (there are some specific technical applications that remain exceptions, as usual).</p><p>The low frequencies are inefficient and difficult to produce with compact electronics, the high frequencies aren't very attractive for food heating applications because of the limited skin depth. So every microwave oven you're likely to run into operates at 2.4GHz, which is pretty much the sweet spot for food heating <i>among the allocated ISM bands</i>. That band is defined as 2.4GHz through 2.5GHz. So I quibble with describing microwaves as "broad spectrum." Magnetrons do not produce very narrow output, one of the reasons they aren't often used for radio transmitters today, but microwave ovens are required to constrain their meaningful output to within 50MHz of 2.45GHz. 100MHz is a <i>lot</i> of bandwidth from a modern radio communications perspective, but isn't really that wide from a perspective of physical effects.</p><p>2.45GHz was chosen as an ISM band in part because it had good properties for heating, but it wasn't put exactly on a resonance frequency for water or anything like that. The exact details of the selection process are obscure but 2.45GHz was already being used for experimental microwave heating before the ISM band was allocated, and I would imagine came out of some combination of ease of magnetron construction and reasonably good heating properties. It is documented, for example, that the EHF bands were never popular for consumer microwave heating because of poor efficacy with food, although they do have industrial applications (especially in welding).</p><p>Given the history of the topic there's a decent chance that 2.45GHz came about because it was being used by experimental radar at the time, the main thing that magnetrons were being built for. Microwave heating was basically a byproduct of radar development during its early days of development.

They’ve even greatly simplified the process due to the explosion of different electronic devices over the last couple decades. This covers your cell phone in the same way it does an e reader or anything else. [0] There are basically no substantiated instances of portable electronics interfering with aircraft. Certainly not the number you’d expect given the massive number of devices that transit on a massive number of planes every day at this point.</p><p>The restriction on usage comes from the FCC, applies specifically to using land mobile frequencies from aircraft, and is not out of concern for safety of the aircraft.</p><p>Things getting up into VHF, UHF and above are “line of sight” propagation. If you can draw a straight line between two points without hitting anything that will attenuate the signal… it’ll pretty much go anywhere. Voyager 1 is transmitting 15 billion miles to us on 8GHz with a 23 watt radio. Your cell phone can put out around 3 watts. People called in to ham radio nets in Vancouver, BC from Seattle, WA on a 5W handheld radio just by going to the top of the Space Needle. People regularly make contact with the ISS or satellites on similar power. A large limiting factor to the distance is the height of the transmitter. Thanks to the curvature of the Earth, over enough distance, that straight line between the two points will begin to intersect the Earth which works great to attenuate the signals to nothing. Getting higher up lets you "shout" further out.</p><p>Your cell phone transmitting at 3 watts from that kind of altitude is potentially hitting dozens or hundreds of cell towers. Frequencies which are intended to be shared among inhabitatants in a maybe dozen mile radius now need to be shared across hundreds of miles, reducing the bandwidth available for everyone. And the weak signal will cause interference substantially further.</p><p>The FCC limited transmissions while on an aircraft to prevent interference with ground communications, and continues to because there isn’t enough evidence that they won’t.</p><p>[0] <a href="https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_91.21-1D.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/...</a>

The power output of a microwave is a sine wave, because it's powered from your AC line power, and doesn't emit energy during the zero crossings.  "Interference robustness" times packet sends (and lengths) to be when the microwave is producing the least amount of power.  Thus, you spend half of every 60th of a second irradiating your food, and the other half downloading videos.  (Needless to say, having this on and your microwave going in the background reduces throughput.  But, dropped packets are worse than small packets that always get through, and this aims to eliminate completely stomped-on packets.)<p>Wifi also has a listen-before-talk model.  If it "hears" a microwave running, it thinks it's another station transmitting, and backs off.  This feature of the protocol is why long-range networks worked so poorly in the past.  If station A can't hear station B, but the AP can hear both of them, then A and B are going to step on each other and the AP won't be able to communicate with either station.  This is why the "enterprise" way of deploying networks was to have a ton of access points running at low power; that works well with the listen-before-talk model since the AP likely can't talk to or hear stations that are too far away for the stations in its range to hear.</p><p>I don't know if interference robustness still exists in modern standards, as I haven't seen it in a control panel for decades, but it was definitely in 802.11b.  I have never tested Bluetooth (or read the standard), but basically... the industry knows this is a problem, and handled it a long time ago.  Bluetooth might ignore the problem because it plans on frequency-hopping (away from the microwave) anyway, but like all software, that can easily be bugged.

Examples of applications for the use of radio frequency (RF) energy in these bands include radio-frequency process heating, microwave ovens, and medical diathermy machines. The powerful emissions of these devices can create electromagnetic interference and disrupt radio communication using the same frequency, so these devices are limited to certain bands of frequencies. In general, communications equipment operating in ISM bands must tolerate any interference generated by ISM applications, and users have no regulatory protection from ISM device operation in these bands.</i></p><p>&gt; <i>Despite the intent of the original allocations, in recent years the fastest-growing use of these bands has been for short-range, low-power wireless communications systems, since these bands are often approved for such devices, which can be used without a government license, as would otherwise be required for transmitters; ISM frequencies are often chosen for this purpose as they already must tolerate interference issues. Cordless phones, Bluetooth devices, near-field communication (NFC) devices, garage door openers, baby monitors, and wireless computer networks (Wi-Fi) may all use the ISM frequencies, although these low-power transmitters are not considered to be ISM devices.</i></p><p>So basically the microwave oven's Faraday cage needs to block enough for safety. There are regulations about the radio spectrum, but they allow it to emit some.

Asked the owner what was going on. Turned out, the guy had a electric can opener, and every day at 4 pm he would open a can to feed his dogs. That was the interference signal they were getting all the way to the observatory!</p><p>Eventually, after some back and forth, they got the guy a new can opener they had vetted to not cause an interference signal.

The only ones that haven't seem to be those expensive integrated under-counter ones where the tray slides out rather than opens like a door.

Instead of properly deorbiting the satellite, Dish sent it into a “disposal orbit” at an altitude low enough to pose an orbital debris risk.</p><figure id="5fe93f1d-8e03-4c99-8082-5686b9e09de2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:2,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/oct/02/astronomers-light-pollution-tetris-block-satellite-bluewalker-3-stars-bright&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Astronomers sound alarm over light pollution from huge new satellite&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;5fe93f1d-8e03-4c99-8082-5686b9e09de2&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>“As satellite operations become more prevalent and the space economy accelerates, we must be certain that operators comply with their commitments,” said Loyaan A Egal, the FCC’s enforcement bureau chief, in the statement announcing the Dish settlement. “This is a breakthrough settlement, making very clear the FCC has strong enforcement authority and capability to enforce its vitally important space debris rules.”</p><p>In 2002, Dish launched the satellite into geostationary orbit – a field of space that begins 22,000 miles (36,000km) above Earth. It agreed in 2012 to an orbital debris mitigation plan that, upon completion of EchoStar-7’s mission, would send the the satellite 186 miles (300km) above where it was stationed, into a “graveyard orbit” where it would not be a risk to other active satellites.</p><p>But in 2022, Dish realized that the satellite was low on propellant, and would not have enough to move to its intended destination. Instead, the satellite ended up only 76 miles (122 km) above the active geostationary orbit areas – 178 km off its mark.</p><p>Space debris, broadly defined by the FCC as artificial objects orbiting Earth that are not functional spacecraft, has been a growing concern for the agency. It says that the more old material that stays in orbit, the harder it is for incoming satellites to start and complete new missions. In 2022, the FCC adopted a rule that would require satellite operators to dispose of their satellites within five years of mission completion.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-7">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-7" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>“Right now there are thousands of metric tons of orbital debris in the air above – and it is going to grow,” FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in a 2022 statement that accompanied the announcement of the rule. “We need to address it.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"> <main> <h2 id="bitmagnet"> <a href="#bitmagnet" aria-labelledby="bitmagnet"></a> bitmagnet </h2> <p><strong>A self-hosted BitTorrent indexer, DHT crawler, content classifier and torrent search engine with web UI, GraphQL API and Servarr stack integration.</strong></p> <p><img src="https://bitmagnet.io/assets/images/webui-1.png" alt="bitmagnet WebUI screenshot"></p> <blockquote> <p>Important</p> <p>This software is currently in alpha. It is ready to preview some interesting and unique features, but there will likely be bugs, as well as API and database schema changes before the (currently theoretical) 1.0 release. If you’d like to support this project and help it gain momentum, <strong><a href="https://github.com/bitmagnet-io/bitmagnet" target="\_blank">please give it a star on GitHub</a></strong>.</p> <p><a href="https://bitmagnet.io/internals-development.html">If you’re interested in getting involved and you’re a backend GoLang or frontend TypeScript/Angular developer, or you’re knowledgeable about BitTorrent protocols then <strong>I’d like to hear from you</strong></a> - let’s get this thing over the line!</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="dht-what-now"> <a href="#dht-what-now" aria-labelledby="dht-what-now"></a> DHT what now…? </h2> <p>The DHT crawler is <strong>bitmagnet</strong>’s killer feature that (currently) makes it unique. Well, almost unique, read on…</p> <p>So what is it? You might be aware that you can enable DHT in your BitTorrent client, and that this allows you find peers who are announcing a torrent’s hash to a Distributed Hash Table (DHT), rather than to a centralized tracker. DHT’s lesser known feature is that it allows you to crawl the info hashes it knows about. This is how <strong>bitmagnet</strong>’s DHT crawler works works - it crawls the DHT network, requesting metadata about each info hash it discovers. It then further enriches this metadata by attempting to classify it and associate it with known pieces of content, such as movies and TV shows. It then allows you to search everything it has indexed.</p> <p>This means that <strong>bitmagnet</strong> is not reliant on any external trackers or torrent indexers. It’s a self-contained, self-hosted torrent indexer, connected via DHT to a global network of peers and constantly discovering new content.</p> <p>The DHT crawler is <em>not quite</em> unique to <strong>bitmagnet</strong>; another open-source project, <a href="https://github.com/boramalper/magnetico" target="\_blank">magnetico</a> was first (as far as I know) to implement a usable DHT crawler, and was a crucial reference point for implementing this feature. However this project is no longer maintained, and does not provide the other features such as content classification, and integration with other software in the ecosystem, that greatly improve usability.</p> <p><a href="https://bitmagnet.io/internals-development/dht-crawler.html">You can find some more technical details about <strong>bitmagnet</strong>’s DHT crawler here</a>.</p> <h2 id="features--roadmap"> <a href="#features--roadmap" aria-labelledby="features--roadmap"></a> Features &amp; Roadmap </h2> <h3 id="currently-implemented-features"> <a href="#currently-implemented-features" aria-labelledby="currently-implemented-features"></a> Currently implemented features </h3> <ul> <li>A DHT crawler</li> <li>A generic BitTorrent indexer: <strong>bitmagnet</strong> can index torrents from any source, not only the DHT network - currently this is only possible via <a href="https://bitmagnet.io/tutorials/importing.html">the <code>/import</code> endpoint</a>; more user-friendly methods are in the pipeline, see high-priority features below</li> <li>A content classifier that can currently identify movie and television content, along with key related attributes such as language, resolution, source (BluRay, webrip etc.) and enriches this with data from <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">The Movie Database</a></li> <li><a href="https://bitmagnet.io/tutorials/importing.html">An import facility for ingesting torrents from any source, for example the RARBG backup</a></li> <li>A torrent search engine</li> <li>A GraphQL API: currently this provides a single search query; there is also an embedded GraphQL playground at <code>/graphql</code></li> <li>A web user interface implemented in Angular: currently this is a simple single-page application providing a user interface for search queries via the GraphQL API</li> <li><a href="https://bitmagnet.io/tutorials/servarr-integration.html">A Torznab-compatible endpoint for integration with the Serverr stack</a></li> </ul> <h3 id="high-priority-features-not-yet-implemented"> <a href="#high-priority-features-not-yet-implemented" aria-labelledby="high-priority-features-not-yet-implemented"></a> High priority features not yet implemented </h3> <ul> <li>Classifiers for other types of content; enrich current classifiers and weed out incorrect classifications.</li> <li>Ordering of search results: the current alpha preview has no facility for specifying the ordering of results.</li> <li>Search performance optimisations: search is currently fast enough to be usable; it becomes more sluggish once millions of torrents have been indexed - there are some low-hanging fruit in terms of optimisation that will be a near-term priority.</li> <li>A monitoring API and WebUI dashboard showing things like crawler throughput, task queue, database size etc.</li> <li>Authentication, API keys, access levels etc.</li> <li>An admin API, and in general a more complete GraphQL API</li> <li>A more complete web UI</li> <li>Saved searches for content of particular interest, enabling custom feeds in addition to the following feature</li> <li>Smart deletion: there’s a lot of crap out there; crawling DHT can quickly use lots of database disk space, and search becomes slower with millions of indexed torrents of which 90% are of no interest. A smart deletion feature would use saved searches to identify content that you’re <em>not</em> interested in, including but not limited to <abbr title="child sexual abuse material">CSAM</abbr>, and low quality content (such as low resolution movies). It would automatically delete associated metadata and add the info hash to a bloom filter, preventing the torrent from being re-indexed in future.</li> <li>Bi-directional integration with the <a href="https://prowlarr.com/" target="\_blank">Prowlarr indexer proxy</a>: Currently <strong>bitmagnet</strong> can be added as an indexer in Prowlarr; bi-directional integration would allow <strong>bitmagnet</strong> to crawl content from any indexer configured in Prowlarr, unlocking many new sources of content</li> <li>More documentation and more tests!</li> </ul> <h3 id="pipe-dream-features"> <a href="#pipe-dream-features" aria-labelledby="pipe-dream-features"></a> Pipe dream features </h3> <p>This is where things start to get a bit nebulous. For now all focus is on delivering the core features above, but some of these ideas could be explored in future:</p> <ul> <li>In-place seeding: identify files on your computer that are part of an indexed torrent, and allow them to be seeded in place after having moved, renamed or deleted parts of the torrent</li> <li>Integration with popular BitTorrent clients</li> <li>Federation of some sort: allow friends to connect instances and pool the indexing effort, perhaps involving crowd sourcing manual content curation to supplement the automated classifiers</li> <li>Something that looks like a decentralized private tracker; by this I probably mean something that’s based partly on personal trust and manually weeding out any bad actors; I’d be wary of creating something that looks a bit like <a href="https://github.com/Tribler/tribler" target="\_blank">Tribler</a>, which while an interesting project seems to have demonstrated that implementing trust, reputation and privacy at the protocol level carries too much overhead to be a compelling alternative to plain old BitTorrent, for all its imperfections</li> <li>Support for the <a href="https://blog.libtorrent.org/2020/09/bittorrent-v2/" target="\_blank">BitTorrent v2 protocol</a>: It remains to be seen if wider adoption will ever make this a valuable feature</li> </ul> </main> </div></div>]]></description>

<p>The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a cornerstone of the Internet, helping to load web pages, stream videos, and fetch data for your favourite apps.</p>



<p>Last year&nbsp;a new version of the protocol, HTTP/3, was standardized&nbsp;by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the organization in charge of defining Internet technologies. Since then, HTTP/3 and the related QUIC protocol have seen a rapid uptake on the public web. The exact numbers depend on the source and measurement methodology, with HTTP/3 support ranging from&nbsp;<a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-the-web#h3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">19%</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="https://2023.apricot.net/assets/files/APPS314/2023-03-01-quic-apri_1677636425.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50+%</a>&nbsp;of web servers and networks worldwide.</p>







<p>Because these new protocols are heavily used by large companies such as Google and Meta, we can safely say that&nbsp;a large chunk of current Internet traffic already uses HTTP/3 today. In fact, the blog post you’re reading right now was probably loaded over HTTP/3!</p>



<p>In this series, I’ll provide some context on what problems HTTP/3 solves, how it performs, why it’s seen such swift adoption, and what limitations it is still working to overcome.</p>



<h2>Why do we need HTTP/3?</h2>



<p>A network protocol describes how data is communicated between two entities on the network, typically the user’s device and a web server. As there are many different companies building software for the web, the protocol needs to be standardized so that all this software can be ‘interoperable’, that is, they can all understand each other because&nbsp;they follow the same rules.</p>



<p>In practice,&nbsp;we don’t use a single protocol but a combination of several at the same time, each with its own responsibilities and rules (Figure 1). This is to make things flexible and reusable — you can still use the exact same HTTP logic, regardless if you’re using Wi-Fi, cable, or 4G/5G.</p>

<p>Many of the original protocols for the Internet were standardized in the 80s and 90s, meaning they were built with the goals and restrictions of those decades in mind.&nbsp;While some of these protocols have stood the test of time, others have started to show their age. Most problems have been solved by workarounds and clever tricks. However, it was clear something would have to change. This is especially true for the Transport Control Protocol (TCP), which ensures your data reliably gets across the Internet.</p>



<h2>Why TCP is not optimal for today’s web</h2>



<p>HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 rely on TCP to successfully do their job.&nbsp;Before a client and server can exchange an HTTP request/response, they must establish a TCP connection.</p>



<p>Over time, there have been many efforts to update TCP and resolve some of its inefficiencies —&nbsp;TCP still loads webpages as if they were single files instead of a collection of hundreds of individual files. Some of these updates have been successful, but most of the more impactful ones (for example, TCP multipath and TCP Fast Open)&nbsp;took nearly a decade to be practically usable on the public Internet.</p>



<p>The main challenge with implementing changes to TCP is thousands of devices on the Internet all have their own implementation of the TCP protocol. These include phones, laptops, and servers, as well as routers, firewalls, load balancers, and other types of ‘middleboxes’. As such,&nbsp;if we want to update TCP, we have to wait for a significant portion of all these devices to update&nbsp;their implementation, which in practice can take years.</p>



<h3>The QUIC solution</h3>



<p>This became a problem to the point that the most practical way forward was to replace TCP with something entirely new.&nbsp;This replacement is the QUIC protocol, though many still (jokingly) refer to it as TCP 2.0. This nickname is appropriate because QUIC includes many of the same high-level features of TCP but with a couple of crucial changes.</p>



<p>The main change is that&nbsp;QUIC heavily integrates with the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. TLS is responsible for encrypting sensitive data on the web — it’s the thing that provides the S (secure) in HTTPS. With TCP, TLS only encrypts the actual HTTP data (Figure 2). With QUIC,&nbsp;TLS also encrypts large parts of the QUIC protocol itself. This means that metadata, such as packet numbers and connection-close signals, which were visible to (and changeable by) all middleboxes in TCP, are now only available to the client and server in QUIC.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fig2-tcp-vs-quic-packetization-1024x531-1.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="531" src="https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fig2-tcp-vs-quic-packetization-1024x531-1.png" alt="Figure 2 — Encryption differences between TCP+TLS and QUIC. QUIC encrypts much more than just the HTTP data." srcset="https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fig2-tcp-vs-quic-packetization-1024x531-1.png 1024w, https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fig2-tcp-vs-quic-packetization-1024x531-1-300x156.png 300w, https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fig2-tcp-vs-quic-packetization-1024x531-1-768x398.png 768w, https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fig2-tcp-vs-quic-packetization-1024x531-1-624x324.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Figure 2 — Encryption differences between TCP+TLS and QUIC. QUIC encrypts much more than just the HTTP data.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Furthermore, because QUIC is more extensively encrypted, it will be much easier than it was for TCP to change it or to add new features — we only need to update the clients and servers, as the middleboxes can’t decrypt the metadata anyway. This makes&nbsp;QUIC a future-proof protocol that will allow us to more quickly solve new challenges.</p>



<p>Of course,&nbsp;this extra encryption is good for the general security and privacy of the new protocol too. While TCP + TLS are perfect for securing sensitive personal data, such as credit cards or email content, they can still be vulnerable to complex (privacy) attacks, which have become ever more practical to execute due to recent advances in AI. By further encrypting this type of metadata, QUIC is more resilient to sophisticated threat actors.</p>



<p>QUIC also has many other security-related features, including defences against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, with features such as amplification prevention and RETRY packets.</p>



<p>Finally,&nbsp;QUIC also includes a large amount of efficiency and performance improvements compared to TCP, including a faster connection handshake (see Figure 3),&nbsp;<a href="https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2020/head-of-line-blocking-in-quic-and-http-3-the-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the removal of the ‘head-of-line blocking’ problem</a>, better packet loss detection/recovery, and ways to deal with users switching networks (I’ll go into more detail on this in my next post).</p>

<h2>We didn’t need HTTP/3; what we needed was QUIC</h2>



<p>Initially, there were attempts to keep HTTP/2 and make minimal adjustments so we could also use QUIC in the lower layers (after all, that’s the whole point of having these different cooperating and reusable protocols). However, it became clear QUIC was just different enough from TCP to make it HTTP/2-incompatible. As such, the decision was made to make a new version of HTTP, just for QUIC, which eventually became HTTP/3.</p>



<p>HTTP/3 is almost identical to HTTP/2. They mainly differ in the technical implementation of the features on top of QUIC or TCP. However, because HTTP/3 can use all of QUIC’s new features,&nbsp;it is expected to be more performant when loading web pages and streaming videos. In practice, it’s especially this aspect that has led to HTTP/3’s rapid adoption.</p>



<p>In my <a href="https://blog.apnic.net/2023/10/02/how-quic-helps-you-seamlessly-connect-to-different-networks/">next post</a>, I’ll go into more detail on a common connectivity problem you’ve most likely experienced and how QUIC can help reduce calls and videos from cutting out when your mobile device changes from using Wi-Fi to cellular connectivity.</p>

<p>And the steady heat building this year could make 2023 not only the hottest year on record but the first to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial temperatures, or the stable climate that preceded the massive release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels. Under the landmark Paris climate accord, nations have pledged to try to keep global warming under that threshold. “It’s very worrying,” says Kate Marvel, a senior climate scientist at Project Drawdown, a nonprofit organization that develops roadmaps for climate solutions.</p>

<p>According to data kept by the Japan Meteorological Agency, this September was about 0.5 degree C (0.9 degree F) hotter than the previous hottest September in 2020. It was also about 0.2 degree C (0.4 degree F) warmer than the previous record high temperature anomaly—a measure of how much warmer or colder a given time period is, compared with the average—which had been set in February 2016 during a blockbuster El Niño.</p>

<p>The September anomaly “is so far above anything we’ve seen before,” says Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist who works at the payment processing firm Stripe and <a href="https://www.theclimatebrink.com/p/visualizing-a-summer-of-extremes">wrote about September’s heat in a recent blog post</a>. On X, formerly known as Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/hausfath/status/1709217151452954998?s=20">he called the feat “absolutely gobsmackingly bananas.”</a></p>

<p>The milestone reached last month comes on the heels <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/july-2023-is-hottest-month-ever-recorded-on-earth/">of July setting the record for the hottest month overall</a>. (July is always the hottest month of the year globally because it occurs at the peak of the Northern Hemisphere summer. The Northern Hemisphere has much more landmass to soak up the sun’s rays than the Southern Hemisphere, so it has the bigger influence on the global annual temperature cycle.)</p>

<p>In a marker of just how much global temperatures have risen in recent decades, Hausfather observes, “this September will be hotter than most Julys before the last decade or two.”</p>

<p>Two main factors are at play in driving temperatures to such extremes: their inexorable increase from burning fossil fuels and an El Niño event that is shaping up to be a strong one. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/el-nino-may-break-a-record-and-reshape-weather-around-the-globe/">El Niño is a part of a natural climate cycle</a> that features a tongue of unusually warm waters across the eastern Pacific Ocean. Those waters release heat into the atmosphere and can cause a cascade of changes to key atmospheric circulation patterns linked to the weather around the world.</p>

<p>Heat waves have broken records all over the globe during the past few months, including prolonged events called heat domes that plagued the southern stretch of the U.S. and parts of the Mediterranean. Summerlike temperatures were even felt in South America during the Southern Hemisphere’s winter. Two of the heat waves—one in the U.S. Southwest and one in Europe—were found to be <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/this-summers-record-breaking-heat-waves-would-not-have-happened-without-climate-change/">virtually impossible without global warming</a>. And summerlike heat has continued in places into October.</p>

<p>The most drastic temperature anomalies typically come in the winter months, when El Niño peaks in strength. In fact, the previous most anomalously warm month was February 2016, during one of the strongest El Niños on record. But this year “we’re seeing these [big anomalies] in the Northern Hemisphere summer,” Hausfather says. That leaves open the possibility of even larger anomalies when this event peaks this winter, particularly if it ends up being another strong event.</p>

<p>It is possible there is also some influence from the phasing out of sulfur-containing fuels used by ships because the aerosols spewed into the air from burning those fuels tend to have a slight cooling effect. The eruption of the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai volcano in the southern Pacific Ocean last year may also be nudging up temperatures because of the huge amounts of water vapor—also a greenhouse gas—it injected into the atmosphere. But both factors have very small influences, compared with climate change and El Niño.</p>

<p>Given that this El Niño is expected to persist and likely to strengthen, there’s a good chance that 2023 or 2024—or both—will become the hottest year on record, besting 2016 (and 2020, which some agencies who monitor climate have tied with 2016). That isn’t surprising, given that there has been a tenth of a degree of warming since 2016, though it is “remarkable just how quickly we’ve seen warmth this year,” Hausfather says. Part of the apparent rapid warming is because 2023 began in the tail end of an unusual string of three back-to-back La Niña events. These tend to have a cooling impact on the global climate, though La Niñas today are hotter than even El Niños of several decades ago.</p>

<p>Beyond potentially becoming the hottest year on record, 2023 could also be the first year to top 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial temperatures (some individual months have already passed that threshold). But even if that happens, all hope is not lost for meeting the Paris accord goals. That threshold is measured as an average of several decades, and climate scientists have long expected that a single year would pass that mark a decade or so before the world could be considered permanently above that limit. “There is still time to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees,” Marvel says. “It is going to be incredibly difficult. The pathways are narrowing.”</p>

<p>But this year should be considered a warning of the future we face if we don’t take rapid, ambitious action. “This is what the world looks like when it’s 1.5 degrees hotter in a year, and it’s terrible,” she says. When the world does permanently pass 1.5 degrees C, the climate anomalies for individual years will reach higher than that mark.</p>

<p>To stave off that future, every bit of carbon we can keep, or take, out of the atmosphere is crucial. “Every tenth of a degree matters,” Hausfather says.</p></div><section><h3>ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</h3><section><p><img src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/1CA8FD9A-9A98-483D-AE3E18788CF77E53_small.png?h=65&amp;w=65" alt="author-avatar" width="65" height="65"></p><div><ul></ul><p><strong>Andrea Thompson</strong>, an associate editor at <em>Scientific American</em>, covers sustainability.&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/@AndreaTWeather">Follow Andrea Thompson on Twitter</a><span>&nbsp;Credit: Nick Higgins</span></p></div></section></section></section></div>]]></description>

        <p dir="auto">In case you’re asking if the <em>patch</em> to libcurl will require a redistribution of pycurl: most distros ship pycurl with dynamic linkage of libcurl (rather than static linkage). In that case, pycurl would <em>almost certainly</em> benefit from the changes to the (dynamically linked) libcurl without repackaging/redistribution.</p>
<p dir="auto">(I say “almost certainly” because the libcurl patch might introduce a relevant ABI change which would require changes to pycurl but I find that very unlikely since there’s no such notice in the OP above.)</p>

        <p dir="auto">Well "this one software project" is one of the most critical ones out there... And I think we all know that OpenSSL is far from perfect (even though I think they improved a lot over the last years) - but guess what ,everyone was happy that they announced it in advance so people could prepare to patch ASAP when the patch hit.</p>
<p dir="auto">Do you seriously prefer to be surprised - maybe on your day off, away from a proper computer - with an urgent update you need to install, instead of knowing some days in advance that you may need to quickly install a patch on a given day?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Antora Energy says its new 2 MW factory will make thermophotovoltaic cells for thermal storage applications. The cells are based on III-V semiconductors and reportedly have a heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency of more than 40%.</p> <p><time datetime="2023-01-25T13:30:55+01:00" itemprop="datePublished" title="Wednesday, January 25, 2023, 1:30 pm">January 25, 2023</time> </p></div><div><p>Antora Energy has started production at its 2 MW thermophotovoltaic cell factory in Sunnyvale, California.</p><p>“The cells are based on III-V semiconductors, which have a higher performance than conventional solar cells, and produce 100 times more power than similarly sized devices,” CEO Andrew Ponec told <strong>pv magazine</strong>. “The cells can convert any source of high temperature heat into electricity and their most important application is for energy storage,” he added referring to thermal energy grid storage (TEGS) consisting of a low-cost, grid-scale energy storage technology that uses TPVs to convert heat to electricity above 2,000 C.</p><p><span><span><a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/31/novel-approach-for-thermophotovoltaics-promises-higher-efficiencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thermophotovoltaics</a> (TPV)</span></span> is a power generation technology that uses thermal radiation to generate electricity in photovoltaic cells. A TPV system generally consists of a thermal emitter that can reach high temperatures, near or beyond 1,000 C, and a photovoltaic diode cell that can absorb photons coming from the heat source.</p><p>The technology has drawn the interest of scientists for decades, because it is able to <span><span>capture sunlight in the entire solar spectrum and has the technical potential to beat the Shockley-Queisser limit of traditional photovoltaics. However, the efficiencies reported thus far have been too low to make it commercially viable, as TPV devices still suffer from optical and thermal losses.</span></span></p><p>“Until now, TPV technology has met neither the efficiency threshold required to compete with traditional heat engines nor the manufacturability threshold required to produce the technology at scale,” said Antora Energy. “Now, Antora has met both of these critical thresholds, demonstrating heat-to-electricity conversion efficiencies greater than 40%, and demonstrating the capability to manufacture TPV at scale.”</p><div id="mid-article-bibblio" data-action="Internal" data-title="Popular content" data-catalogue="Articles" data-location="Mid Single Article"><h3>Popular content</h3></div><p>The startup said it has secured funding from the California Energy Commission to build the TPV manufacturing line in California in 2021.</p><p>“Some of Antora’s earliest funding was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy to develop TPV technology in partnership with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Arizona State University,” said the company.</p><p>In April, a group of researchers from the <a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/14/mit-scientists-develop-pv-cleaning-system-based-on-electrostatic-repulsion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT) and the US Department of Energy's <a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/09/09/nrel-scientists-test-back-contact-architecture-on-perovskite-solar-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> (NREL) unveiled a <a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/31/novel-approach-for-thermophotovoltaics-promises-higher-efficiencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thermophotovoltaic</a> (TPV) cell featuring <a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/04/four-terminal-iii-v-solar-cell-with-32-57-efficiency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">III–V materials</a> with bandgaps between 1.0 and 1.4 eV.

<p>The suspect components — which Delta declined to identify — were found on an unspecified number of its engines, a company spokesman said Monday. Those engines account for less than 1% of the more than 2,100 power plants on its mainline fleet, the spokesman said. &nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://fortune.com/company/american-airlines-group/" target="_blank" rel="">American Airlines Group</a> Inc., <a href="https://fortune.com/company/united-continental-holdings/" target="_blank" rel="">United Airlines</a> Holdings Inc. and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/southwest-airlines/" target="_blank" rel="">Southwest Airlines</a> Co. <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/22/why-so-many-flights-canceled-delayed-aog-technics-fake-parts-american-airlines/" target="_self" rel="">previously disclosed finding parts from AOG Technics</a> Ltd. on aircraft engines. That London-based company is at the center of probes by regulators into spare engine parts it sold for a longstanding type of jet engine made by CFM International Inc., a joint venture of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/general-electric/" target="_blank" rel="">General Electric</a> Co. and <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/22/safran-ceo-cannot-quantify-fake-parts-scandal-rocking-airlines/" target="_self" rel="">Safran SA</a>.</p>



<p>Delta would not say if the engines with the fraudulently documented parts had been on planes while they were in service. The problematic pieces, which were certified by AOG, were detected during engine work by an unnamed third party, the spokesman said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As many as 21 of Delta’s engines could have been affected, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data provided by the airline, which would represent the most among US carriers that have disclosed a number. As many as 96 total engines were impacted by parts supplied by AOG, GE has said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Delta has been informed by one of our engine service providers that a small number of engines they overhauled for us contain certain parts that do not meet documentation requirements,” the company said in a statement. “Working with the overhaul provider, we are in the process of replacing those parts and remain in compliance with all FAA guidelines.”</p>



<p>None of Delta’s aircraft are currently flying with unapproved parts, and the <a href="https://fortune.com/company/discovery-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="">discovery</a> hasn’t affected flight operations, the Delta spokesman said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Airlines, maintenance providers and regulators across the globe have been scouring records to hunt down AOG-supplied parts with forged airworthiness documents after European authorities in August determined the parts broker had supplied suspect components. Virgin Australia Airlines Pty also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-18/virgin-australia-finds-second-jet-part-with-fake-certificate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found engines</a>&nbsp;with suspect parts.</p>



<p>AOG last month was ordered by a London judge to hand over records to help identify additional suspect parts after GE and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/safran/" target="_blank" rel="">Safran</a> filed a lawsuit seeking documents relating to “every single sale of products.”</p></div><div id="text1_wrapper" data-cy="subscriptionPlea">
