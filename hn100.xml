    <p>Listening to Daft Punk every now and then is a never aging event for me. Their albums have a variety of musical diversity, and you can always enjoy their fairly repetitive songs on boring household activities. ‘One more time, we’re gonna celebrateh! Oh yeah, Don’t stop the washing!’ Well, one of the most influential electronic duos of the millennium had plenty of tricks in their bag to put into their music. Today, I will try to introduce three of them with examples.</p>

  What is Psychoacoustics?

  </a>
</h3>
<p>Psychoacoustics is an area that includes sound perception and audiology. The area studies psychological responses to auditory events, and the field is as extensive as acoustics, psychology, sound and electronic engineering, physics, and biology. The human auditory system is a complex system that starts from our pinna (your visible ear) and continues to the ear canal, membrane, auditory ossicles, cochlea, lateral superior olive, and medial superior olivary and travels in your brain to hear what is vibrating over the air. Everything we experience has a processing time of milliseconds. Perhaps that shows how fast and strong the human brain is. Although we have such a capable auditory system, scientists have shown that our perception may play some tricks when it comes to audio recognition. And by that, I don’t mean the physical mechanism but psychologically induced ones. Those findings show that hearing is also cultural; different cultures may hear differently.</p>

  Continuity Effect &amp; Phonemic restoration effect

    <span>Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>If a sound is interrupted by a noise with enough loudness in a short interval, we tend to hear the sound continuously. One can create gaps less than 200ms in a tone and fill those gaps with a particular noise which will hide the gaps for you. The shortness of duration combined with the noise, our brains tend to hear a continuous sound signal. Phonemic restoration slightly differs from the continuity effect. This time our brain “fills” the gaps of missing sounds. Our brain acts meddlesome in favor of increased intelligibility, even though the sound lacks information. We observe this phenomenon in the popular Daft Punk song: “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.” If you start listening around 2:20, you will experience the various cuts. (most noticeable around 2:50)</p>

  The Octave Illusion (Deutsch’s Octave Illusion)

  </a>
</h3>
<p>The Octave Illusion is one of the most interesting psychoacoustic illusions, first discovered by Diana Deutsch in 1973. The illusion works as follows: Two tones, one with higher and one with lower pitch, play in our ears in an alternating fashion visualized as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ugu.rs/images/alternating.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There is one octave between the tones. If the alternation is short enough, you will hear the higher tone in one ear and the lower in the other. Your handedness plays a role here. Right-handed people tend to hear the higher pitch in the right ear. If you are left-handed or ambidexter your perception may vary. For this illusion, our example comes from the Discovery album. Open the song Aerodynamic and fast-forward to 2:28, start listening to the passage. I hear the higher pitch on my right and the lower one on my left ear. What about you?</p>

<h3 id="talking-piano">

  </a>
</h3>
<p>This effect is the art of making the piano (or another instrument) speak! There are a number of examples of it, where people approximate human speech by converting it into fundamental frequencies and then playing the piano notes to reconstruct the atomic structures of speech. An interesting example you can find is <a href="https://ablinger.mur.at/docu11.html">here</a>. Even though the effect is named a talking piano, other instruments can speak as well. In their song “Robot Rock”, you can hear the guitar chords talking, as if they are singing the lyrics, ehm, Robot Rock!</p>

  Conclusion

  </a>
</h3>
<p>There are more than three auditory illusions to present (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVsMiSrlSSc">maybe more than 40</a>) and Daft Punk may have created songs including those illusions. It is evident that hearing is not just physical but also psychological. Speaking of psychology, does anyone know how do our feelings connect to music? Listening to Instant Crush, Veridis Quo, or Something About Us, you will most likely fall into a brown study. That is a phenomenon I can’t explain myself either.</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>

<p>Four years from now, if all goes well, a nuclear-powered rocket engine will launch into space for the first time. The rocket itself will be conventional, but the payload boosted into orbit will be a different matter.</p>
<p>NASA announced Wednesday that it is partnering with the US Department of Defense to launch a nuclear-powered rocket engine into space as early as 2027. The US space agency will invest about $300 million in the project to develop a next-generation propulsion system for in-space transportation.</p>
<p>"NASA is looking to go to Mars with this system," said Anthony Calomino, an engineer at NASA who is leading the agency's space nuclear propulsion technology program. "And this test is really going to give us that foundation."</p>
<h2>Back to the future</h2>
<p>Traditional chemical propulsion is great for blasting rockets off the surface of the Earth, but such machines are terribly inefficient for moving around the Solar System. They don't sip fuel; they guzzle it. To go as far as Mars would require a huge amount of propellant and liquid oxidizer and take at least six months. For humans to truly become a spacefaring species, there needs to be a better way.</p>
<p>Wernher von Braun, the German engineer who defected to the United States after World War II, recognized the potential of nuclear thermal propulsion even before his Saturn V rocket landed humans on the Moon with chemical propulsion. Eventually, this led to a project called NERVA (Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application). It was eventually canceled to help pay for the Space Shuttle.</p>
<p>The basic idea is straightforward: A nuclear reactor rapidly heats up a propellant, probably liquid hydrogen, and then this gas expands and is passed out a nozzle, creating thrust. But engineering all of this for in-space propulsion is challenging, and then there is the regulatory difficulty of building a nuclear reactor and safely launching it into space.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>And so nuclear thermal propulsion technology sat on the shelf for a long, long time. Finally, in 2020, the curious folks at the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/06/the-us-military-is-getting-serious-about-nuclear-thermal-propulsion/">said they wanted to test</a> a flyable nuclear thermal propulsion system. This planted the seed for a program called the Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO). The military was interested in efficiently moving payloads around Earth and the Moon—hence the inclusion of cislunar.</p>

<p>NASA later joined in, with the goal of developing similar technology for a Mars mission. The reason is obvious: A lot of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/02/report-nasas-only-realistic-path-for-humans-on-mars-is-nuclear-propulsion/">scientists and engineers believe</a> that the only sustainable way to develop a Mars exploration program is through the use of nuclear propulsion.</p>
<h2>The plan forward</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, NASA and DARPA announced they had selected Lockheed Martin to serve as the primary contractor to assemble the experimental nuclear thermal reactor vehicle (X-NTRV) and its engine. BWX Technologies will be one of Lockheed Martin’s partners, and it will develop the nuclear reactor and fabricate the high-assay low-enriched uranium fuel to power the reactor.</p>
<p>The value of the award is $499 million, said Tabitha Dodson, program manager for the effort at DARPA, in a teleconference with reporters.</p>
<p>NASA will take the lead on developing the nuclear engine, and DARPA will oversee a host of other issues, from the nuclear regulatory requirements to the mission's operations and all analyses of the vehicle's safety. The nuclear reactor will launch in "cold" mode for safety reasons and will not be turned on until it reaches a sufficiently high orbit.</p>
<p>This final orbit has yet to be determined, but it is likely to be 700 to 2,000 km above the surface of the Earth, such that the vehicle's reentry into the planet's atmosphere will take place hundreds of years after any nuclear reactions occur.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The nuclear-powered vehicle will launch within the payload fairing of a Falcon 9 or Vulcan rocket, Dodson said, and look much the same as the upper stage of a conventional rocket. It will consist of a large hydrogen fuel tank, a nuclear reactor, a supporting spacecraft structure, and a nozzle. Once it reaches a safe orbit, the reactor will be turned on. The liquid hydrogen will then be heated from 20 Kelvin—just 20° Celsius above absolute zero—to 2,700 Kelvin in less than a second.</p>
<p>And then? Well, we'll see. There are some unknowns about the performance of a reactor and its uranium fuel in zero gravity.</p>
<p>"It's important to keep in mind that this is a demonstration engine," Dodson said. "And just like any other test of a rocket engine, NASA may need to do a series of follow-on engine development work in order to get closer to their perfect operational engine."</p>
<h2>Don’t forget about the hydrogen</h2>
<p>This experiment is exciting beyond just the testing of the nuclear engine. While plenty of new technology will go into developing a nuclear reactor that can operate in microgravity, a lot of effort will also go into managing the vehicle's liquid hydrogen propellant.</p>
<p>Until now, liquid hydrogen has only been successfully stored in space for days since it boils above the extremely cold temperature of 20 Kelvin. Dodson said this mission would attempt to store liquid hydrogen in its ultra-cold state for a couple of months, allowing enough time for multiple tests of the nuclear thermal engine.</p>
<p>After the propellant runs out, the engine will no longer be able to operate, even though mission controllers on the ground will still retain communication with the spacecraft. The mission could be extended if it could be robotically refueled, and Dodson said the spacecraft designers are attempting to allow for this possibility.</p>
<p>Perhaps NASA and DARPA will have learned enough by then, however, to move into the development of an operational engine that will fly somewhere.</p>

She was unhappy with the outlet’s reporting on how </span><a href="http://marionrecord.com/direct/media_ejected_at_open_forum_+5446forum+4d6564696120656a6563746564206174206f70656e20666f72756d20" rel="">she kicked out reporters</a><span> from a recent event at her establishment with US Congressman Jake LaTurner (R-KS) and subsequent research they were conducting. The cops responded in kind, seizing cell phones, computers, and other devices necessary for publishing the paper after receving a signed search warrant from a judge.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>What has remained unreported until now is that, prior to the raids, the newspaper had been actively investigating Gideon Cody, Chief of Police for the city of Marion. They’d received multiple tips alleging he’d retired from his previous job to avoid demotion and punishment over alleged sexual misconduct charges.</strong></p><p><span>The news of the multiple raids was reported Friday by both </span><a href="https://marionrecord.com/" rel="">the paper itself</a><span> and by nonprofit news service </span><em><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2023/08/11/police-stage-chilling-raid-on-marion-county-newspaper-seizing-computers-records-and-cellphones/" rel="">Kansas Reflector</a></em><span>. After receiving an alert from the Kansas Press Association, </span><em>Reflector </em><span>Editor-in-Chief Sherman Smith said he quickly understood the gravity of the situation. “My immediate reaction: This is an attack on all journalists, and we have to respond,” Sherman told The Handbasket in an email Friday night. “My staff and I stopped what we were doing and directed our attention to reporting this story.”</span></p><p><span>I reached out to Eric Meyer, owner and publisher of the</span><em> Marion County Record</em><span>, late Friday evening to get his reaction to the unprecedented raids and to learn about any new updates in the case. Below is our conversation, edited for length and clarity.</span></p><p><strong>Marisa Kabas: I wanted to check in and see if there had been any updates since the raids yesterday.</strong></p><p>Eric Meyer: We’ve pieced together enough equipment so that we'll probably be able to put out our paper. Our big question is how to get the material for it, which we don't have any of. I mean, I'm gonna have to go hunting to find the name plate for the front page. </p><p>But other than that, we're doing ok. Been in lots of talks with lots of lawyers. That's pretty much the long and short of it, I guess for now. Just getting started on rebuilding everything. So, we've got a bit of work to do with that.</p><p><strong>MK: And what are the lawyers telling you right now?</strong></p><p><span>EM: That</span><strong> </strong><span>the people who did this are going to learn a very expensive lesson. Their real question was, from a legal standpoint, was it more important that we get it [the newspaper’s equipment] back right now, or is it more important that we—for lack of a better word—stick it to them? We’re able to survive now, and I don't really want to stick it to anybody, but we need to have something that's big enough to convince somebody that you really don't do this. Not in America. This is not something that you do here. So, we'll be working in that direction.</span></p><p><strong>MK: When the raids happened, were you at the office or were you at your home?</strong></p><p>EM: I was at my home. I stay here with my 98-year-old mother and she was actually waiting for her meal to arrive from Meals on Wheels. And I thought when I heard the knocking, that was a meal person. I know they normally just leave it outside and no, it was a couple of police officers.&nbsp;</p><p><span>I immediately tried to call the newspaper and I couldn't get through to the newspaper because they had raided them at the same time and forced them to go outside. So, although I did have a landline here—the advantage of living with a 98 year old woman is you've got a landline!—they couldn't answer at the </span><em>Record</em><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p>At the newspaper office, they'd been forced to leave the office. We weren't forced to leave the house here. But my mother is very upset about having police in her house for several hours. They stood here for a long time. </p><p>I got in the car and left to go down to the newspaper office. And actually along the way had to stop because I couldn't find phone numbers [since all his devices had been seized]. I wanted to call the attorney we normally use from the open government coalition that usually provides initial consulting for us, and I didn't have his phone number. So I actually stopped at somebody's house along the way and said, can I borrow your tablet to look up a phone number and then borrow your phone to make a call?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MK: So when the police arrived at your door, what was initially running through your head?</strong></p><p><span>EM: I had no idea what they were doing there. They said “we’re here to execute a search warrant.” And at that point, I kind of figured out what it was, because of the blustering that I'd heard from Kari earlier in the week. But, yeah, I didn't know quite what they wanted to do. I said, “guys, you're really making a very serious mistake here.”</span><strong> </strong><span>But what ran through my head was the old saying that when the police say something, you've got to do it. There's time to object to it later. Don't object to it then, or they can charge you with interfering with law enforcement.&nbsp;</span></p><p>So I just told them that I thought they were making a serious mistake and they said they're just doing their jobs. And being a small enough town, I knew who they were. One of them was a part-time officer and he was wearing his bulletproof vest on the outside, and I know the new uniform requirements in the city, where they're supposed to wear it on the inside of their shirt.&nbsp;</p><p>My mother got very, very, very, very upset about this and about that time her lunch did arrive, and she never did eat it yesterday. She refused to eat it. In fact, she refused to eat anything. She refused to go to bed last night. She sat up all night. She was very upset about this. They came into her home. She did nothing wrong.</p><p><strong>MK: That's very upsetting, I can imagine. And what has it been like having all this attention all of a sudden?</strong></p><p>EM: It's not wanted attention, let's put it that way. </p><p>It is kind of heartwarming: One of the things that I just noticed was we got this incredible swelling of people buying subscriptions to the paper off of our website. We got a lot of them, including some—I'm not gonna say who they're from—but one of them is an extremely famous movie producer and screenwriter who came in and subscribed to the paper all of a sudden. I mean, it's like, why are people from Poughkeepsie, New York and Los Angeles, California and Seattle, Washington and, you know, all these different places subscribing to the paper?</p><p>But a lot of people seem to want to help, and we've had people calling, asking “where can I send money to help you?” And, well, we don't need money right now. We just are gonna have a long weekend of work to do. But we'll catch up.</p><p><span>[</span><em>At this point, Meyer explained the backstory as reported by his paper and the Kansas Reflector: He and his reporter Phyllis Zorn were kicked out of an August 2nd meeting at a local establishment with US Congressman Jake LaTurner (R-KS) by the City of Marion Police Chief after restaurant owner Kari Newell demanded they leave. Meyer and Zorn published a subsequent story about the hostile encounter, which infuriated Newell and prompted angry Facebook posts.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>The paper then received a tip about Newell having her license suspended in 2008 after a DUI, checked it out, decided not to publish it, and ultimately shared it with the local police because they believed it might’ve been shared with them as part of Newell’s ongoing divorce battle. The police then told Newell what the newspaper shared, and she attended Monday’s City Council meeting to make outrageous claims about the newspaper and one of the council members (who had also obtained the letter) violating her rights. She also called Meyer later that evening and erroneously accused him of identity theft. Not even four days later, police arrived at the newspaper office, Meyer’s home and the council member’s home with search warrants signed by a judge.</em><span>]</span></p><p>EM: So the backstory that we haven't told, because we don't wanna get in trouble, is that we've been investigating the police chief [Gideon Cody]. When he was named Chief just two months ago, we got an outpouring of calls from his former co-workers making a wide array of allegations against him saying that he was about to be demoted at his previous job and that he retired to avoid demotion and punishment over sexual misconduct charges and other things.&nbsp;</p><p>We had half a dozen or more different anonymous sources calling in about that. Well, we never ran that because we never could get any of them to go on the record, and we never could get his personnel file. But the allegations—including the identities of who made the allegations—were on one of the computers that got seized. I may be paranoid that this has anything to do with it, but when people come and seize your computer, you tend to be a little paranoid.</p><p><strong>MK: I just wanna make sure I'm 100% clear: so you haven't reported on this before?</strong></p><p>EM: We've gathered a lot of information. Deb, one of our reporters, has worked for weeks on this story. And we kind of didn't get anywhere with it. We tried to alert the city through backdoor channels that they needed to really look at his employment record. They said, “oh, we have,” and we talked to the Kansas City, Missouri Police where he was from, and the Human Resources Department said, “no, nobody's ever looked at his record.” Then two days later, somebody did look at it after they'd already told us they'd done so. </p><p>But the Kansas City Missouri Police HR Department told us, they [the city of Marion] asked specifically for only those things in which he [Cody] had been convicted and disciplinary action had been taken. And so that's all they gave him. This action wasn't completed. So that was where we kind of had to leave the story. They went ahead and hired him.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MK: So you feel comfortable publicly saying that you would have been investigating the police chief?</strong></p><p>EM: I wouldn't feel comfortable printing individual allegations, but it is true that we were investigating him and we had decided not to run anything at this point. We're not making any allegations against him, but we had investigated allegations.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MK: Have you heard from Congressman LaTurner since the police raids?</strong></p><p><span>EM: No, we have not. But again, it is so hard to reach us right now. Unless you have this landline [</span><em>Ed note: we were speaking via his home landline that he’d provided via email</em><span>] and I happen to be there, or the other landline [at the office] and I happen to be there. I haven't seen any email from them, nor have I received any calls from them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>MK: With all the national attention, what should people outside Kansas know about Marion?</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>EM: It’s a very small rural community. I worked at the </span><em>Milwaukee Journal</em><span> for 20 years and then taught at the University of Illinois. And they'd say, where are you from? And I'd say I'm from Kansas. And they’d say where in Kansas? And I'd say, if you've heard of any place in Kansas, it’s 60 miles from there. It's kind of out in the middle of nowhere. We are on the boundary of an area code. We're on the boundary of three zip codes. We're on the boundary between two TV markets. It's a farming community that also has some resort activities. We have a couple of lakes which in Kansas is kind of unusual. But mostly it's a farming community.</span></p><p>But other than that, it's like a lot of small towns. We are unusual in that running the paper isn't my livelihood. I mean, I retired from the University of Illinois. I still have a pension from the Milwaukee Journal. I haven't even taken my social security yet. And I don't take a salary, unless I take a bonus at the end of the year if we made any money from the newspaper. So I don't get regularly paid, and it's not my livelihood.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm doing this because I believe that newspapers still have a place in the world and that the worst thing that a newspaper could do was shrink its reporting staff, stop reporting, fill itself with non-news when there's still news out there. And if you do a good job of providing news, you will get readers.&nbsp;</p><p>We try to be aggressive with the news and we try to be fearless with the news because as I say, we're doing this because we care about the community. And that's one of the points I've tried to make, is that it's really hard to commit journalism properly with people who don't care about the community they're serving.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MK: I just wanted to end with one last question: What do you think this raid on your paper and on your home says about the state of journalism in the country right now?</strong></p><p><span>EM: I haven't been able to see enough of the outpouring from the people </span><em>in</em><span> this town. We've been getting incredible support from people outside this town. People in this town have been very supportive, but not publicly. And I talked to one person who said, “Oh, are you sure It's ok that I can talk to you because they might come and seize my computer?” They're afraid. They're really afraid that the police power is unchecked, and that they can be punished like this. And I think that's why I think it's important for us to fight this as much as we can, because it is destroying everything we're trying to do with democracy, which is to get people more involved.&nbsp;</span></p><p>We've been trying to get people involved because people are afraid that if they step up—in a small town particularly—they will get squashed. Someone will knife them in the back. They will tell all their friends to stop doing business with them, or they will shun them, or they won't take them to the country club.</p><p>It’s a way to dispirit people from becoming involved in government by making them think that if you do, there's gonna be consequences and they're going to be negative. And in a community that's largely a lot of older people, a lot of them have said, you know, I've fought all the battles. I don't want to have a new battle that I'm dealing with. So they'll all complain about something, but they'll do it very quietly. We won't hear about it.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Tips?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Linux kernel is often mentioned as a overwhelmingly large open source software. As of this writing, the latest version is v6.5-rc5, which consists of 36M lines of code. Needless to say, Linux is a fruit of hard work of many contributors over the decades.</p>
<p>However, the first version of Linux, v0.01 was pretty small. It consisted of only 10239 lines of code. Excluding comments and blank lines, it was only 8,670 lines. It's small enough to understand and is a good starting point to learn about the internals of UNIX-like operating system kernels.</p>
<p>Reading v0.01 was really fun for me. It was like visiting Computer History Museum in Mountain View - finally I witnessed <em>tales</em> are indeed true! I wrote this post to share this exciting experience with you. Let's dive in!</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: Obviously I'm not the author of Linux v0.01. If you find any mistakes in this post, please let me know!</em></p>
<h2 id="how-do-system-calls-look-like">How do system calls look like?</h2>
<p>v0.01 has 66 system calls. Here's the list of them:</p>
<pre><code><span>access acct alarm break brk chdir chmod
</span><span>chown chroot close creat dup dup2 execve
</span><span>exit fcntl fork fstat ftime getegid geteuid
</span><span>getgid getpgrp setsid getpid getppid
</span><span>getuid gtty ioctl kill link lock lseek
</span><span>mkdir mknod mount mpx nice open pause

</span><span>setgid setpgid setuid setup signal stat
</span><span>stime stty sync time times ulimit umask
</span><span>umount uname unlink ustat utime waitpid write
</span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>It supports reading, writing, creating, and deleting files and directories. Also, other fundamental concepts like <code>chmod(2)</code> (permission), <code>chown(2)</code> (owner), and <code>pipe(2)</code> (inter-process communication) are also supported.</li>
<li><code>fork(2)</code> and <code>execve(2)</code> were there. Only <code>a.out</code> executable format was supported.</li>
<li>The concept of sockets was not implemented. Thus, no network support.</li>
<li>Some features like <code>mount(2)</code> was not implemented: they just return <code>ENOSYS</code>:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span><span>int</span> <span>sys_mount</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
</span><span><span>{</span>
</span><span>	<span>return</span> <span>-</span>ENOSYS<span>;</span>

</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="deeply-hardcoded-for-intel-386-architecture">Deeply hardcoded for Intel 386 architecture</h2>
<p>There is <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/appa.html">a very famous debate</a> Linus had a debate with Andrew S. Tanenbaum, the author of MINIX, about the design of operating systems: monolithic vs. microkernel, which is better design?</p>
<p>Tanenbaum <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/appa.html#:~:text=LINUX%20is%20tied%20fairly%20closely%20to%20the%2080x86">pointed out that</a> Linux is (or <em>was</em>) not portable because it was deeply hardcoded for Intel 386 (i386):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MINIX was designed to be reasonably portable, and has been ported from the Intel line to the 680x0 (Atari, Amiga, Macintosh), SPARC, and NS32016. LINUX is tied fairly closely to the 80x86.  Not the way to go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's indeed true. Linux v0.01 was deeply hardcoded for o386. Here's the implementation of <code>strcpy</code> in <code>include/string.h</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>extern</span> <span>inline</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span> <span>strcpy</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span> dest<span>,</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span>src<span>)</span>
</span><span><span>{</span>
</span><span><span>__asm__</span><span>(</span><span>"cld\n"</span>
</span><span>	<span>"1:\tlodsb\n\t"</span>
</span><span>	<span>"stosb\n\t"</span>
</span><span>	<span>"testb %%al,%%al\n\t"</span>
</span><span>	<span>"jne 1b"</span>
</span><span>	<span>::</span><span>"S"</span> <span>(</span>src<span>)</span><span>,</span><span>"D"</span> <span>(</span>dest<span>)</span><span>:</span><span>"si"</span><span>,</span><span>"di"</span><span>,</span><span>"ax"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>return</span> dest<span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>It's written in assembly with string instructions of i386. Yes it can be found in today's portable implementations of <code>strcpy</code>, but it's in <code>include/string.h</code> - not in somewhere like <code>include/i386/string.h</code>. Moreover, no <code>#ifdef</code> to switch the implementation for different architectures. It's just hardcoded for Intel 386.</p>
<p>Also, supported devices are for PC/AT compatible machines, here's the list of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/CMOS">CMOS</a>: Real-time clock (<code>init/main.c</code>).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Programmable_Interval_Timer">Programmable Interval Timer (PIT)</a>: Timer (<code>kernel/sched.c</code>).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/ATA_PIO_Mode">ATA (PIO)</a>: Hard disk (<code>kernel/hd.c</code>).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/VGA_Hardware">VGA (text mode)</a>: Display (<code>kernel/console.c</code>).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/%228042%22_PS/2_Controller">Intel 8042</a>: PS/2 Keyboard (<code>kernel/keyboard.s</code>). Yes it's completely written in assembly!</li>
</ul>
<p>As you may noticed, they're not in <code>drivers</code> directory as in today's Linux. They're hardcoded in core subsystems.</p>
<h2 id="freax">"FREAX"</h2>
<p>I've read in somewhere that Linus originally named his kernel "FREAX". Makefile in <em>Linux</em> v0.01 still had the following comment:</p>
<pre><code><span># Makefile for the FREAX-kernel.
</span></code></pre>
<p>It was indeed FREAX!</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-file-system-supported-in-v001">What's the file system supported in v0.01?</h2>
<p>Today, Linux supports a variety of file systems such as ext4, Btrfs, and XFS. What about v0.01? ext2? Nope, here's a hint from <code>include/linux/fs.h</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>#</span><span>define</span> <span>SUPER_MAGIC</span> <span><span>0x137F</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>The answer is, as <a href="https://sdk.vercel.ai/r/XR1FQfg">GPT-4 correctly guessed</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minix_file_system">MINIX file system</a>!</p>
<p>Fun fact: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_system">ext</a> ("extended file system"), the predecessor of ext2/ext3/ext4, is inspired by MINIX file system.</p>

</span><span>			<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span>p<span>)</span>

</span><span>	<span>}</span>
</span><span>	<span>switch_to</span><span>(</span>next<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>i</code> and <code>p</code> hold the task's index in the task table (not PID!) and the pointer to <code>task_struct</code> respectively. The key variable is <code>counter</code> in <code>task_struct</code> (<code>(*p)-&gt;counter</code>). The scheduler picks up the task with the largest <code>counter</code> value and switches to it. If all runnable tasks have counter value of 0, it updates each task's <code>counter</code> value by <code>counter = (counter &gt;&gt; 1) + priority</code> and restarts the loop. Note that <code>counter &gt;&gt; 1</code> is a faster way to divide by 2.</p>
<p>The key point would be the counter update. It also updates the counter value of non-runnable tasks. This means that if a task is waiting for I/O for a <em>long time</em>, and its priority is higher than 2, counter value will monotonically increase when counter is updated. This is just my guess, but I think this is for prioritizing rarely-runnable-but-latency-sensitive tasks like shell, which would waits for keyboard typing in most of the life.</p>
<p>Lastly, <code>switch_to(next)</code> is a macro which switches the CPU context to the picked task. It's well described in <a href="https://www.maizure.org/projects/evolution_x86_context_switch_linux/">here</a>. In short, it was based on a x86-specific feature called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_state_segment">Task State Segment (TSS)</a>, which is no longer used for task management in x86-64 architecture.</p>
<p>By the way, there's an interesting comment about the scheduler:</p>
<pre><code><span> *  'schedule()' is the scheduler function. This is GOOD CODE! There
</span><span> * probably won't be any reason to change this, as it should work well
</span><span> * in all circumstances (ie gives IO-bound processes good response etc).
</span></code></pre>
<p>Yes it's indeed good code. Unfortunately (or fortunately), this prophecy is false. Linux became one of most practical and performant kernel which has introduced many new scheduling improvements and algorithms over the years, like Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS).</p>

<p>It calls each subsystem's initialization functions. Pretty straightforward. But there's something interesting: it calls <code>fork(2)</code> in kernel's <code>main()</code>. Also, <code>init()</code> looks like an ordinary implementation in user space, but it's hardcoded in the kernel code!</p>
<p>It looks as if it's fork(2)-ing in the kernel space, but it's actually not. The trick is in <code>move_to_user_mode()</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>#</span><span>define</span> <span>move_to_user_mode</span><span><span>(</span><span>)</span> </span><span>\</span>

</span><span>	<span>"movw %%ax,%%gs"</span> \            <span>// Set GS to user data segment</span>
</span><span>	<span>::</span><span>:</span><span>"ax"</span><span>)</span>                      <span>// No RET instruction here: </span>

</span></code></pre>
<p>You don't need to fully understand the assembly code above. What it does is to switch to the user mode using <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Getting_to_Ring_3#iret_method">IRET instruction</a> but continue executing the following lines in the kernel code with the current stack pointer! Thus, the following <code>if (!fork())</code> is executed in user mode and <code>fork(2)</code> is actually a system call.</p>
<h2 id="linus-didnt-have-a-machine-with-8mb-ram">Linus didn't have a machine with 8MB RAM</h2>
<pre><code><span> * For those with more memory than 8 Mb - tough luck. I've
</span><span> * not got it, why should you :-) The source is here. Change
</span><span> * it. (Seriously - it shouldn't be too difficult. ...
</span></code></pre>
<p>Today, machines with 8GB RAM are very common. Furthermore, 8GB is not enough at all for software engineers ;)</p>

<p>Lastly, I tried to compile the kernel with modern toolchains but failed to do so. I thought GCC (or C itself) has good backward compatibility, but it's not sufficient. Even with older standard <code>-std=gnu90</code> caused compile errors that are not trivial to fix.</p>
<p>One fun fact is Linux had used his own GCC with a feature named <code>-mstring-insns</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span># If you don't have '-mstring-insns' in your gcc (and nobody but me has :-)
</span><span># remove them from the CFLAGS defines.
</span></code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure what it is, but it seems to be a feature to support (or optimize?) <a href="https://www.cs.uaf.edu/2017/fall/cs301/lecture/10_06_string_inst.html">x86 string instructions</a>.</p>
<p>If you managed to compile the kernel with modern toolchains, write an article and send me a link :D</p>
<h2 id="read-yourself">Read Yourself!</h2>
<p>I hope you enjoyed reading the source code of Linux v0.01 as much as I did. If you're interested in v0.01, download <a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/linux-0.01.tar.gz">the tarball of v0.01 from kernel.org</a>. Reading the code is not so hard especially if you've read <a href="https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public">xv6</a> before. Linux v0.01 is minimalistic but is very well written.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article" role="article">
      <p>PostgreSQL authorization has always been a black box for me. I’ve never “needed” different roles to manage who/what has
access to my DB. I’ve always relied on <code>postgres</code> superuser for all my web applications, and it has worked so far!</p>
<p>I recently needed to avoid <code>postgres</code> superuser. To become SOC2 compliant, we needed to remove global access and fine-tune who has access to
what schemas and tables. This is where my journey starts in the PostgreSQL authorization realm.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</details>

<p>Let’s start laying the foundation with the different concepts we will use.</p>
<h3 id="users">Users</h3>
<p>There are no more <em>users</em>! Starting with PostgreSQL 8.1, the concepts of <em>users</em> and <em>groups</em> were superseded
by <em>roles</em>.</p>
<h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>
<p>Roles are the main concept when managing access permissions. Each role has different privileges.
Privileges can be <code>USAGE</code>, <code>SELECT</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, etc., and enables the role access to granted objects.</p>
<p>It’s possible to grant a role to be a <em>member</em> of another role as we’ll see in the GRANT command section. The granted role inherits all the <em>privileges</em> of the said role.</p>
<p>Example of role membership:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a <code>read_access</code> role.</li>
<li>Creating a role <code>metabase</code> and granting <em>membership</em> to the <code>read_access</code> role. The <code>metabase</code> role inherits all the privileges from <code>read_access</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/user-manag.html">Official docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="privileges">Privileges</h3>
<p>The <code>role</code> that creates the object is the owner of the said object. Only the owner and a <em>superuser</em> can do
any operation on the object. We must grant <strong>privileges</strong> to allow other roles to use the object.</p>
<p>The most common DB objects are databases, schemas, tables, views, tablespaces, functions, operators, casts, sequences, and extensions.</p>
<p>The right to modify or destroy an object is only the owner’s privilege. For example, there is no way to grant a privilege to alter a table; only the owner can modify it.</p>
<p>Granting privileges indicates to PostgreSQL what actions a role can execute on what DB objects. We can specify that a role
can only read (<code>SELECT</code>) specific tables, or a role can only create (<code>INSERT</code>) rows in one table but not other tables, etc.</p>
<p>The privileges that we can grant depend on the object itself. You can see the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-priv.html#PRIVILEGE-ABBREVS-TABLE">complete list of privileges and objects</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-priv.html">Official docs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="authentication-and-authorization-commands">Authentication and authorization commands</h2>
<p>These are the commands I used to set up the different roles I needed. There are more variations, but this sufficed for my use case. I’ll link each command’s official documentation.</p>
<h3 id="create-role">CREATE ROLE</h3>
<p>When you create a role, it can have different <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/role-attributes.html">attributes</a>.
Attributes allow the role to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a DB</li>
<li>Connect to the DB</li>
<li>Be a <em>superuser</em></li>
<li>Create other roles</li>
<li>Set a password</li>
<li>Limit the number of connections</li>
</ul>
<p>You can specify the attributes like this:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>ROLE</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>[ [ WITH ]</span><span> attribute </span><span>[ attribute_args ]</span><span> ]</span></span></code></pre>
<p>For example, to specify that a role <code>backend_app</code> can <code>LOGIN</code> and have a <code>PASSWORD</code> “strong-password”:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>-- LOGIN allows the role connect to the DB.</span></span>
<span><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>ROLE</span><span> backend_app </span><span>WITH</span><span> </span><span>LOGIN</span><span> </span><span>PASSWORD</span><span> </span><span>'strong-password'</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createrole.html">Official docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="create-user">CREATE USER</h3>
<p>As we mentioned <a href="#users">earlier</a>, there are no more <em>users</em> in PostgreSQL. The command exists as a wrapper of the <code>CREATE ROLE</code> command.</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>-- CREATE USER includes LOGIN attribute by default.</span></span>
<span><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>USER</span><span> </span><span>backend_app</span><span> </span><span>WITH</span><span> </span><span>PASSWORD</span><span> </span><span>'strong-password'</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>-- is equivalent to:</span></span>
<span><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>ROLE</span><span> backend_app </span><span>WITH</span><span> </span><span>LOGIN</span><span> </span><span>PASSWORD</span><span> </span><span>'strong-password'</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-createuser.html">Official docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="grant">GRANT</h3>
<p>The <code>GRANT</code> command has two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give DB objects access to roles through <em>privileges</em>.</li>
<li>Give a role membership to other roles.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s best to show this <code>GRANT</code> command with the following examples; the documentation is quite extensive.</p>
<p><strong>Granting read privilege to existing tables to <code>read_access</code> role</strong></p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>GRANT</span><span> </span><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>ON</span><span> ALL TABLES </span><span>IN</span><span> </span><span>SCHEMA</span><span> public </span><span>TO</span><span> read_access;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>I stress <em><strong>existing tables</strong></em> because this doesn’t grant read access to future tables created.
If you want to grant access to <em>future</em> tables, you need to <a href="#alter-default-privileges">alter the default privileges of the <code>read_access</code> role</a> and specify the tables’ creator role.</p>
<p><strong>Granting all privileges to role <code>ops</code> to the <code>operations</code> schema and its tables</strong></p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>-- Privileges on schema: be able to create more tables.</span></span>
<span><span>GRANT</span><span> ALL PRIVILEGES </span><span>ON</span><span> </span><span>SCHEMA</span><span> operations </span><span>TO</span><span> ops;</span></span>
<span><span>-- Privileges on tables: be able to create rows.</span></span>
<span><span>GRANT</span><span> ALL PRIVILEGES </span><span>ON</span><span> ALL TABLES </span><span>IN</span><span> </span><span>SCHEMA</span><span> operations </span><span>TO</span><span> ops;</span></span>
<span><span>-- Privileges on sequences: using serial primary keys.</span></span>
<span><span>GRANT</span><span> ALL PRIVILEGES </span><span>ON</span><span> ALL SEQUENCES </span><span>IN</span><span> </span><span>SCHEMA</span><span> operations </span><span>TO</span><span> ops;</span></span>
<span><span>-- Privileges on routines: function, aggregate function, window function, or procedure.</span></span>
<span><span>GRANT</span><span> ALL PRIVILEGES </span><span>ON</span><span> ALL ROUTINES </span><span>IN</span><span> </span><span>SCHEMA</span><span> operations </span><span>TO</span><span> ops;</span></span></code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note on being able to <code>ALTER</code> a table (add, remove, or change columns). You must own the table to use <code>ALTER TABLE</code>. To alter the owner, you must also
be a direct or indirect member of the new owning role, and that role must have CREATE privilege on the table’s schema.
This blog post doesn’t cover how to change schema, table, or sequences ownership. <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altertable.html">Official docs</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Giving <code>metabase</code> role membership to <code>read_access</code></strong></p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>-- Create metabase role.</span></span>
<span><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>ROLE</span><span> metabase </span><span>WITH</span><span> </span><span>LOGIN</span><span> </span><span>PASSWORD</span><span> </span><span>'strong-password'</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>-- Grant membership.</span></span>
<span><span>GRANT</span><span> read_acess </span><span>TO</span><span> metabase;</span></span></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-grant.html">Official docs</a></p>
<h3 id="alter-default-privileges">ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This command allows you to set privileges that will be applied to objects created in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This command alters the default privileges when a new object is created. Every object has an owner, so you must specify the owner’s <em>role</em> as part of the command.</p>
<p><strong>Giving read tables permission to <code>read_access</code> role to future tables created by role <code>postgres</code></strong></p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>ALTER</span><span> </span><span>DEFAULT</span><span> PRIVILEGES FOR </span><span>ROLE</span><span> postgres </span><span>GRANT</span><span> </span><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>ON</span><span> TABLES </span><span>TO</span><span> read_access;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This means that the <code>metabase</code> user (created in the <a href="#grant">previous step</a>) can read tables created in the future by the <code>postgres</code> role.
If a role other than <code>postgres</code> creates tables, <code>read_access</code> won’t have access unless default privileges are modified for the said role.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-alterdefaultprivileges.html">Official docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="reassign-owned">REASSIGN OWNED</h3>
<p>This command is a shortcut to change all DB objects ownership a specific role owns. I haven’t tested it, but knowing that this exists is useful.</p>
<p><strong>Changing all objects created by <code>postgres</code> role to <code>other_db_role</code> role</strong></p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>REASSIGN OWNED </span><span>BY</span><span> postgres </span><span>TO</span><span> other_db_role;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Be sure to read the <strong>NOTES</strong> section of the official docs, as this command has some caveats.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-reassign-owned.html">Official docs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="scoping-the-roles-you-need">Scoping the roles you need</h2>
<p>Before creating different roles, we need to determine what roles we need and what each role will have access to.</p>
<p>Questions that can help you figure out what roles you need for your use case:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the different services that use the DB?
<ul>
<li>Do they need read and write access to the DB?</li>
<li>Only read access?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What are the various teams in your company that need access?
<ul>
<li>Do all they need to read and write, or just read access?</li>
<li>To what schemas and tables do they need access?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What other roles would make your app more secure?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="real-world-example">Real-world example</h2>
<h3 id="current-state">Current state</h3>
<p>We’ve been using the <code>postgres</code> role in the past year. We use this single role/password combination in all our different systems connecting to the database.</p>
<h3 id="desired-state">Desired state</h3>
<p>We want to become SOC2 compliant. As part of the spec, we must minimize access following the <em>least privilege access control</em>.
We must define different roles according to their needs and remove all access to the <code>postgres</code> role.
We’ll ensure access removal to <code>postgres</code> by rotating its password when all the systems use specific roles tailored to their needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Engineering team: read and write access to all schemas and tables.</li>
<li>DB Migrations: backend app that creates schemas, create and update tables. DB migrations run when releasing the application (new deployment).</li>
<li>Metabase: read access to all schemas and tables.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lets-do-it">Let’s do it!</h3>
<h4 id="lets-start-with-db_migrations-role">Let’s start with <code>db_migrations</code> role.</h4>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>ROLE</span><span> db_migrations </span><span>WITH</span><span> </span><span>LOGIN</span><span> </span><span>PASSWORD</span><span> </span><span>'strong-password'</span><span>;</span></span>

<p>The object’s owner (<code>db_migrations</code>) has complete control over them, and it doesn’t need extra privileges to access them.
Current applications that use <code>postgres</code> role won’t be affected because <code>postgres</code> is a <em>SUPERUSER</em>.</p>
<h4 id="following-up-with-the-engineering-role-to-read-and-write-access-to-all-schemas-and-tables">Following up with the <code>engineering</code> role to read and write access to all schemas and tables</h4>
<p>Let’s create two roles: <code>read_access</code> and <code>write_access</code>. These roles will act on existing and future DB objects. This
allows us to create multiple roles &lt;&gt; passwords per application granting membership to either <code>read_access</code>, <code>write_access</code>, or both.</p>

                        Your request will automatically be routed to the appropriate Center Software Release Authority (SRA) for processing. Many NASA Open Source software codes and mobile apps provide a URL link so that the requester can download the software directly.

                        Each NASA code has been evaluated for access restrictions and designated for a specific type of release according to the purpose for which the software code was designed. Some codes are deemed restricted because they have been developed for a specific government purpose (e.g., they may have munitions or defense applications). Codes designated U.S. Government Purpose Release require the user to work for a federal agency or a business/university with an active contract, grant, or Space Act Agreement with the federal government.

                    <p>
                        When software is classified as a U.S. Government Purpose Release, NASA must be able to verify that the software will be used for a current U.S. government contract. For non-NASA contracts/grants, you will receive an email from the Center SRA asking for a copy of the front page of the contract and the pages that contain the current statement of work and period of performance for the contract/grant. In some cases, the agency’s contract monitor may be asked to verify the contract information. Once the contract information is received, the appropriate Software Usage Agreement (SUA) will be sent to you for signature.

                <div id="faq-7"><p>
                        Most software requests will be processed within 5 business days. After your request is reviewed by the Center SRA, you (or the individual identified on your request form with authority to sign the agreement) will receive an email notification that a Software Usage Agreement is ready for review and signature. If additional information is required in order to process your request, you will be contacted by the Center SRA with the specific details needed to complete your request.

                        After your signed agreement is accepted by the Center SRA, you will receive an email notification of the method of software delivery. If the software code is available for download through the NASA Software Catalog system, you will have 14 days to download the software through your user account.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>It’s been a year and a half since the <a href="https://asahilinux.org/">Asahi Linux</a> project allowed us to run Arch Linux natively on our Apple Silicon computers. And while my overall experience has been excellent, the Asahi Linux project is switching their flagship Linux distribution (distro) <a href="https://asahilinux.org/2023/08/fedora-asahi-remix/">from Arch to Fedora</a>.</p>
<p>Why the switch from Arch to Fedora? You could argue that Fedora is a much more popular mainstream distribution compared to Arch, or that Linus Torvalds himself uses Fedora already on his Apple Silicon-based Macbook using the Asahi boot components and drivers. But the main reason is that there have been many <a href="https://social.treehouse.systems/@marcan/109971521711413167">issues</a> surrounding the maintenance of ARM packages for Arch Linux, and that the Fedora team is both capable and willing to provide provide the support needed to provide a truly polished Linux experience on modern Macs (the main goal of the Asahi Linux project). By moving to Fedora, the Asahi team can focus on reverse engineering Apple hardware while the Fedora team can focus on maintaining the distribution itself on the Apple Silicon platform. This combination of Fedora with the Asahi boot components and drivers for Apple Silicon is called <em><strong>Fedora Asahi Remix</strong></em>.</p>
<p>I’ve been running Asahi based on Arch Linux since it was released, and <a href="https://jasoneckert.github.io/myblog/ultimate-linux-arm64-workstation/">my experience has been stellar overall</a>. The Asahi project exposed me to Arch Linux for the first time, and it quickly turned into my second favourite Linux distribution of all time. Ironically, my favourite Linux distribution over the past few decades has been Fedora, and I have no problem saying Goodbye to my Arch setup for it as a result.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I’ll discuss how I migrated from the original Asahi based on Arch Linux to Fedora Asahi Remix, as well as my initial impressions. TLDR: It’s awesome… as shown in this screenshot of the sway desktop in Fedora Asahi Remix on my Mac Studio (right-click the image and choose to open it in a new browser tab if you want to zoom in on it easily):</p>
<p><img src="https://jasoneckert.github.io/myblog/fedora-asahi-remix/fedora-asahi-remix-sway-desktop.png#center" alt="Fedora Asahi Remix Sway Desktop" title="Fedora Asahi Remix Sway Desktop"></p>
<h2 id="part-1-migration">Part 1: Migration</h2>
<h2 id="backing-up-arch-linux-files-and-configuration">Backing up Arch Linux files and configuration</h2>
<p>There is no automated way to migrate from one Linux distribution to another. You just have to install the new distribution and migrate your files and configuration over. And while you can copy files across the network to another system, it’s generally easier just to copy them to some large capacity external drive, since you’ll be copying them back to the same machine shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>In my case, I have a 2TB SSD in a USB enclosure with a single exFAT partition that I mounted to the /mnt directory using <code>sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt</code>. Next, I copied over the dotfiles (hidden configuration files) within my home directory (<code>cp -R ~/.* /mnt</code>), as well as the entire contents of my home directory (<code>cp -R ~/* /mnt</code>). My home directory contains subdirectories with all of my documents, development files, container images, cloud configuration, music, and so on. The only files outside my home directory included those for my QEMU virtual machines and associated installation ISO images, which I easily copied over using <code>cp -R /VMs /ISOs /mnt</code>.</p>
<h2 id="removing-existing-linux-partitions">Removing existing Linux partitions</h2>
<p>After backing up my files and configuration, I booted into macOS to remove the existing Linux partitions. You can use <a href="https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/Partitioning-cheatsheet">this cheatsheet</a> to understand how to do this, but I’ll outline it briefly here.</p>
<p>If you open a Terminal app in macOS and run the <code>sudo diskutil list</code> command (as shown below for my system), you’ll notice a 2.5 GB partition that contains the Apple-specific stuff needed to boot Asahi Linux. This partition (e.g., disk0s3) is actually an Apple Filesystem (APFS) container that is synthesized into a separate disk (e.g., disk2). You’ll also notice an EFI system partition used to boot Linux and the associated Linux filesystem partition (e.g., disk0s4 and disk0s5). Together, these three partitions (outlined in red) comprise Asahi Linux.</p>
<p><img src="https://jasoneckert.github.io/myblog/fedora-asahi-remix/AsahiPartitions.png#center" alt="AsahiPartitions" title="AsahiPartitions"></p>
<p>The other partitions comprise macOS and include the Apple ISC boot partition (e.g., disk0s1), the Apple recovery partition (e.g., disk0s6), and the APFS container partition that is synthesized to the disk that stores the macOS filesystem (e.g., disk0s2).</p>
<p>To remove the three Asahi partitions on my system, and resize the APFS container that stores macOS to use the freed space afterwards, I ran the following commands. You can skip the last command if you just want to use the same amount of space for Fedora Asahi Remix, since the beginning of the installation script will allow you to select this free space instead of shrinking the APFS container that stores macOS.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo diskutil erasevolume free free disk0s5
sudo diskutil erasevolume free free disk0s4
sudo diskutil apfs deleteContainer disk0s3
sudo diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 0
</code></pre><p>Following this, I ran a <code>sudo diskutil list</code> again to verify they were indeed gone, and that the APFS container that stores the macOS filesystem was assigned the free space:</p>
<p><img src="https://jasoneckert.github.io/myblog/fedora-asahi-remix/AsahiPartitionsRemoved.png#center" alt="AsahiPartitionsRemoved" title="AsahiPartitionsRemoved"></p>
<h2 id="installing-fedora-asahi-remix">Installing Fedora Asahi Remix</h2>
<p>The installation process for Fedora Asahi Remix is nearly identical to the original Asahi installation process. Within macOS, you run the installation script from the <a href="https://fedora-asahi-remix.org/">Fedora Asahi Remix website</a> (<code>curl https://fedora-asahi-remix.org/install | sh</code>) within a macOS Terminal app and follow the instructions provided.</p>
<p>After a brief welcome, you’ll be prompted to shrink the APFS container that stores macOS to leave some free space for Asahi:</p>
<p><img src="https://jasoneckert.github.io/myblog/fedora-asahi-remix/i1.png#center" alt="Installation1" title="Installation1"></p>
<p>Following this, you’ll choose to install Fedora into this free space (which will create the same three Asahi-specific partitions noted earlier). There are several builds of Fedora+KDE, Fedora+GNOME, Fedora Server, and Fedora Minimal to choose from as shown in the truncated list below:</p>
<p><img src="https://jasoneckert.github.io/myblog/fedora-asahi-remix/i2.png#center" alt="Installation2" title="Installation2"></p>
<p>Fedora+KDE is the default for Fedora Asahi Remix because KDE Plasma Workspaces has superb ARM support compared to GNOME (which has traditionally been the default desktop on Fedora).</p>
<p>Next, you’ll choose how much of the free space to use for the three Asahi-specific partitions (there’s no reason to choose anything less than ‘max’ unless you want to install multiple distributions), as well as the volume name that is displayed on the Mac startup options screen:</p>
<p><img src="https://jasoneckert.github.io/myblog/fedora-asahi-remix/i3.png#center" alt="Installation3" title="Installation3"></p>
<p>Following this, the installation script will download and extact the necessary files, instruct you to reboot to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) for Fedora Asahi Remix, and then complete the installation using the Fedora installer (time/zone, networking, user accounts).</p>
<h2 id="performing-post-installation-tasks">Performing post installation tasks</h2>
<p>Like the original Asahi, Fedora Asahi Remix with KDE Plasma Workspaces was refreshingly fast and stable. However, before restoring my files, I decided to add some software packages I needed. More specifically, I installed the package groups for development (which includes several important development tools, including Git), the GNOME desktop, and sway window manager:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
sudo dnf groupinstall "GNOME"
sudo dnf groupinstall "Sway Desktop" 
</code></pre><p>While the Sway Desktop package group included the waybar and grim packages I use in sway, it didn’t include the rofi app launcher, or the fonts and alacritty terminal I use. So, I installed those packages next using <code>sudo dnf install rofi fontawesome-fonts terminus-fonts terminus-fonts-console alacritty</code>.</p>
<p>Following this, I installed the three apps I regularly use: VLC media player, Chromium, and Visual Studio Code. VLC media player and Chromium could be installed using <code>dnf install vlc chromium</code> (VLC first requires you <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-fedora.html">add the rpmfusion repository</a>). However, to obtain Visual Studio Code, I had to download the RPM from Microsoft (<a href="https://update.code.visualstudio.com/1.81.0/linux-rpm-arm64/stable/">https://update.code.visualstudio.com/1.81.0/linux-rpm-arm64/stable/</a>) and install it afterwards using <code>sudo rpm -ivh code*aarch64.rpm</code>.</p>
<p>At this point, I had the tools, desktops, and apps I needed, but I needed to restore my sway, waybar, and rofi dotfiles from my backup to get back my sway desktop configuration:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
cp -R /mnt/.config/sway ~/.config/
cp -R /mnt/.config/waybar ~/.config/
cp -R /mnt/.config/rofi ~/.config/
</code></pre><p>Next, I configured my containers, Kubernetes cluster, and virtual machines. I prefer podman to docker, but still like using docker commands, which are nicely provided by the <code>docker</code> command included within the podman-docker package. So I ran <code>dnf install podman-docker</code> (which also installs podman and QEMU as dependences) and restored my containers from backup (including my Nextcloud instance). Kubernetes (I use K3s) also installed without any issues using the script from <a href="https://k3s.io/">the K3s website</a>. My configuration here took longer to restore, but that’s only because it’s mostly additional Kubernetes containers, extras, and configuration manifests from a private Git repository. Finally, I restored my QEMU virtual machine files and ISOs from backup using <code>cp -R /mnt/VMs /mnt/ISOs /</code>.</p>
<h2 id="part-2-first-impressions">Part 2: First Impressions</h2>
<p>In the original <a href="https://asahilinux.org/2023/08/fedora-asahi-remix/">Fedora Asahi Remix annoucement</a>, it was noted that there are still some loose ends that needed to be tied up and that Fedora Asahi Remix would be ready by the end of August as a result. At the end of this same announcement, it was noted that <em>Adventurous users can try out the Fedora Asahi Remix today, but please expect rough spots (or even complete breakage)</em> and that they <em>ask that reporters and bloggers wait for the official release before evaluating our work</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m disobeying this last statement, but only because I have zero negative things to say about Fedora Asahi Remix in its current state. Otherwise, I would have gladly waited until the release at the end of this month out of respect for the Asahi and Fedora teams.</p>
<p>I expected a few hiccups during the migration process, such as apps I needed that weren’t supported, odd hardware issues, devices that didn’t work, or even general configuration issues.
There were none of these whatsoever. Instead, I got a polished distribution that was far easier to configure compared to the original based on Arch Linux.</p>
<p>My entire sway/waybar/rofi configuration migrated perfectly. The only setting I had to change in my sway configuration was the shortcut to open Visual Studio Code (on the original Asahi, I had it installed as a Flatpak package instead of an RPM). I actually don’t have any Flatpak packages installed on Fedora Asahi Remix at all because all the software I needed was available in RPM format. There was no searching high and low for QEMU packages missing from the software repository like I had to do on Arch Linux. Instead, everything I needed was already there from when I installed the podman-docker package that included QEMU as a dependency. I just restored my VM files, and the scripts I use to start the VMs worked without any modification. Ditto for my containers and Kubernetes configuration.</p>
<p>All the hardware works, my peripheral devices work, and the whole migration process was seamless. I’m up and running with my system and all of its software in the same state less than 3 hours after installing Fedora Asahi Remix. And it’s a better system. Kudos to the Asahi and Fedora teams!</p>

            <p>In World War II, the story goes, the British invented a new kind of onboard radar (amusingly called <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/a-wwii-propaganda-campaign-popularized-the-myth-that-carrots-help-you-see-in-the-dark-28812484/?ref=atvbt.com">AI</a>) that allowed its pilots to shoot down German planes at night. </p><p>They didn't want the Germans to know about this technology, but they had to give an explanation for their new, improbable powers.</p><p>So they invented a propaganda campaign that claimed their pilots had developed exceptional eyesight by eating "an excess of carrots." </p><p>If you're going to trick people into doing something, eating excessive carrots seems like one of the better ones. Still, there's an issue: people who believed the propaganda and tried to get super-sight would be spending time and effort on something that couldn't possibly solve their problem. I'll call this a Carrot Problem.</p><p>Once you look for Carrot Problems, you see them everywhere. Essentially, any time someone achieves success in a way they don't want to admit publicly, they have to come up with an excuse for their abilities. And that means misleading a bunch of people into (potentially) wasting their time, or worse.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>People who take steroids don't generally admit to taking steroids, so they come up with various explanations for their new physiques. But anyone who follows that advice will be disappointed; without the steroids, they just won't get the same results.</li><li>Many companies basically distribute their jobs to friends and insiders, but don't want to admit that publicly. So they set up public application processes, which cause outsiders to waste time and effort applying through a channel that has 0 chance of landing them the job.</li><li>Various companies make a lot of money by implementing "dark patters", such as getting customers onto subscriptions and then making it hard for them to cancel. They can't admit that this is why their revenue went up, so they make a bunch of claims about how their success comes out of [various beneficent strategies], but anyone who tries to replicate the success by using those lovely strategies is liable to go broke.</li></ul><p>It's impossible to know the scale of Carrot Problems in business: it's possible that every successful business got there by doing something ugly, but you'll never know that by reading public statements. Most business biographies become useless once you realise that they're Carrot Problemmed.</p><p>For this reason, Carrot Problems greatly increase the value fo being an "insider". </p><p>There's some fields where it really might be true that you can learn everything you need to know by reading books at the public library. But anytime people are succeeding for reasons they won't admit in public, it's hard to get a grasp on the situation unless you have private back-channels.</p><p>I've personally seen the damage that certain narratives cause to outsiders who believe that you can succeed by doing [X/Y/Z], because famous businesspeople kept saying so, and they believed it.</p><p>Of course, once you know that your supposed-role-models are doing [some bad thing] to succeed, that doesn't mean you will do it too. Ideally you find some other way to succeed in the same field without doing bad things; if not, you might just decide that this particular game isn't one you want to play. </p><p>But the privilege of being an insider is that you won't waste your time trying to succeed using a strategy that doesn't actually work, while some poor kid is eating carrots all day in the hopeless hope that it will fix her eyesight.</p>

Record labels including UMG, Capitol and Sony have filed a copyright infringement lawsuit in the United States targeting Internet Archive and founder Brewster Kale, among others. Filed in Manhattan federal court late Friday, the complaint alleges infringement of 2,749 works, recorded by deceased artists, including Frank Sinatra, Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong and Bing Crosby.

<p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/internetarchive.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/internetarchive.jpg" alt="internet archive" width="280" height="187" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20280%20187'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/internetarchive.jpg"></a>As the Internet Archive continues to deal with an <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/internet-archive-is-liable-for-copyright-infringement-court-rules-230325/">adverse ruling</a> in a copyright infringement lawsuit filed by the world’s largest publishing companies, late Friday some of the world’s largest record labels launched similar legal action in the United States.</p>
<p>Filed in Manhattan federal court, the complaint lists UMG Recordings, Capitol Records, Concord Bicycle Assets, CMGI Recorded Music Assets, Sony Music and Arista Music as plaintiffs, with Internet Archive (IA), founder Brewster Kahle, Kahle/Austin Foundation, George Blood and George Blood L.P named as defendants.</p>
<h2>Pre-1972 78rpm Records by Iconic Artists, All Deceased</h2>
<p>The plaintiffs’ complaint focuses on the Internet Archive’s ‘Great 78 Project’ which aims to preserve, research and discover 78rpm records produced between 1898 and the 1950s.</p>
<p>“While the commercially viable recordings will have been restored or remastered onto LP’s or CD, there is still research value in the artifacts and usage evidence in the often rare 78rpm discs and recordings,” IA <a href="https://great78.archive.org/">wrote</a> following the launch of the project in 2017.</p>
<p>“Already, over 20 collections have been selected by the Internet Archive for physical and digital preservation and access. Started by many volunteer collectors, these new collections have been selected, digitized and preserved by the Internet Archive, George Blood LP, and the Archive of Contemporary Music.”</p>
<center><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/great-78-project.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/great-78-project.png" alt="great-78-project" width="610" height="324" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/great-78-project.png 740w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/great-78-project-300x159.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20610%20324'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/great-78-project.png 740w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/great-78-project-300x159.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/great-78-project.png"></a></center>
<p>From IA’s perspective, the project is all about the preservation of art. From the diametrically opposed view of the plaintiffs, the defendants willfully made copies thousands of recordings to which they own the copyrights. The digitized copies were then uploaded to the Internet Archive from where they were illegally distributed to users of the website millions of times.</p>
<p>The complaint lists 2,769 individual works from some of the most fmaous artists of all time, including Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Miles Davis, and Louis Armstrong. Listed songs include “White Christmas” by Bing Crosby, “Sing, Sing, Sing” by Benny Goodman, “Peggy Sue” by Buddy Holly, and “Roll Over Beethoven” by Chuck Berry.</p>
<h2>Plaintiffs: Preservation Claims Are a “Smokescreen”</h2>
<p>The nonprofit Internet Archive is known for its ambitious projects that aim to retain, restore and redistribute content that they believe should never be lost to history. For the plaintiffs, these grand ambitions are nothing but a “smokescreen” to hide what amounts to IA offering “free and unlimited access to music for everyone,” regardless of copyright.</p>
<p>“In truth, Defendants’ malfeasance springs from their disregard for copyright law and the rights of artists and content owners. Internet Archive and the other Defendants have a long history of opposing, fighting, and ignoring copyright law, proclaiming that their zealotry serves the public good. In reality, Defendants are nothing more than mass infringers,” the complaint reads.</p>
<p>The record companies further reject claims that the music being made available illegally needs to be ‘saved’. They claim that of the 2,749 recordings listed in the complaint, all but a “small sample” are already available to stream or download from licensed online platforms so they “face no danger of being lost, forgotten, or destroyed.”</p>
<p>The complaint states that when the 78rpm records were converted into digital files, IA reproduced copyrighted recordings without permission. When IA copied those files to a server, that amounted to another unauthorized reproduction, and when it transferred those copies to the public, yet another. When it streamed unlicensed copies to the public, each time that constituted an unlicensed public performance.</p>
<p>“When Defendants exploit Plaintiffs’ sound recordings without authorization, neither Plaintiffs nor their artists see a dime. Not only does this harm Plaintiffs and the artists or their heirs by depriving them of compensation, but it undermines the value of music,” the complaint adds.</p>
<h2>Overall Infringement and Claims For Relief</h2>
<p>The plaintiffs allege that the Great 78 Project contains more than 400,000 works that have been downloaded or streamed millions of times. In a letter sent by the RIAA to IA in 2020, the plaintiffs allege that IA owner Brewster Kahle was informed of the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“You and Internet Archive have reproduced thousands of sound recordings in which RIAA member companies own or exclusively control copyrights, and have made those recordings available to the public for unrestricted download and streaming, all without the consent of the rights owners.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>“Your unauthorized reproduction, distribution and public performance of these recordings is a plain violation of the RIAA member companies’ rights under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1401">17 U.S.C. § 1401</a>, and constitutes nothing less than piracy on a massive scale.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The RIAA says that Kahle and the Internet Archive were ordered to “immediately cease and desist from their infringement” but the demand was ignored.</p>
<p>The complaint lists several causes of action against different combinations of defendants, including unlawful reproduction under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106">17 U.S.C. §§ 106(1)</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1401">1401(a)(1)</a> for which the companies are entitled damages and any profits accrued. Alternatively the record companies seek statutory damages of $150,000 for each protected recording infringed, so with over 2,700 works in suit, damages could exceed $400m.</p>
<p>Other claims include infringing reproduction and distribution, infringing public performance, contributory copyright infringement, inducement of infringement, and vicarious copyright infringement. The companies also seek injunctive relief to restrain “continuing infringing conduct.”</p>
<p><em>The complaint and list of sound recordings are available here (<a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/1-23-cv-07133-UMG-et-al-v.-Internet-Archive-et-al-complaint-230811.pdf">1</a>,<a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/1-23-cv-07133-UMG-et-al-v.-Internet-Archive-et-al-complaint-works-in-suit-230811.pdf">2</a>, pdf)</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>I started using Mastodon back in November, and it’s the Twitter alternative
where I’ve been spending most of my time recently, mostly because the Fediverse
is where a lot of the Linux nerds seem to be right now.</p>

<p>I’ve found Mastodon quite a bit more confusing than Twitter because it’s a
distributed system, so here are a few technical things I’ve learned about it
over the last 10 months. I’ll mostly talk about what using a single-person
server has been like for me, as well as a couple of notes about the API, DMs
and ActivityPub.</p>

<p>I might have made some mistakes, please let me know if I’ve gotten anything
wrong!</p>

<h3 id="what-s-a-mastodon-instance">what’s a mastodon instance?</h3>

<p>First: Mastodon is a decentralized collection of independently run servers
instead of One Big Server. The software is <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon">open source</a>.</p>

<p>In general, if you have an account on one server (like <code>ruby.social</code>), you
<strong>can</strong> follow people on another server (like <code>hachyderm.io</code>), and they can
follow you.</p>

<p>I’m going to use the terms “Mastodon server” and “Mastodon instance”
interchangeably in this post.</p>

<h3 id="on-choosing-a-mastodon-instance">on choosing a Mastodon instance</h3>

<p>These were the things I was concerned about when choosing an instance:</p>

<ol>
<li>An instance name that I was comfortable being part of my online
identity. For example, I probably wouldn’t want to be
<code>@b0rk@infosec.exchange</code> because I’m not an infosec person.</li>
<li>The server’s stability. Most servers are volunteer-run, and volunteer
moderation work can be exhausting – will the server really be around in a few
years? For example <a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/mastodon-technology-shutdown/">mastodon.technology</a>  and mastodon.lol shut down.</li>
<li>The admins’ moderation policies.</li>
<li>That server’s general reputation with other servers. I started out on
<code>mastodon.social</code>, but some servers choose to block or limit mastodon.social
for various reasons</li>
<li>The community: every Mastodon instance has a local timeline with all posts
from users on that instance, would I be interested in reading the local
timeline?</li>
<li>Whether my account would be a burden for the admin of that server (since I have a lot of followers)</li>
</ol>

<p>In the end, I chose to run my own mastodon server because it seemed simplest –
I could pick a domain I liked, and I knew I’d definitely agree with the
moderation decisions because I’d be in charge.</p>

<p>I’m not going to give server recommendations here, but here’s a list of the <a href="https://gist.github.com/jvns/5eb0a58319b93049a8c014433766edd3">top 200 most common servers people who follow me use</a>.</p>

<h3 id="using-your-own-domain">using your own domain</h3>

<p>One big thing I wondered was – can I use my own domain (and have the username <code>@b0rk@jvns.ca</code> or something) but be on someone else’s Mastodon server?</p>

<p>The answer to this seems to be basically “no”: if you want to use your own
domain on Mastodon, you need to run your own server. (you can <a href="https://blog.maartenballiauw.be/post/2022/11/05/mastodon-own-donain-without-hosting-server.html">kind of do this</a>,
but it’s more like an alias or redirect – if I used that method to direct <code>b0rk@jvns.ca</code> to <code>b0rk@mastodon.social</code>, my
posts would still show up as being from <code>b0rk@mastodon.social</code>)</p>

<p>There’s also other
ActivityPub software (<a href="https://jointakahe.org/">Takahē</a>) that supports people
bringing their own domain in a first-class way.</p>

<h3 id="notes-on-having-my-own-server">notes on having my own server</h3>

<p>I really wanted to have a way to use my own domain name for identity, but to
share server hosting costs with other people. This isn’t possible on Mastodon
right now, so I decided to set up my own server instead.</p>

<p>I chose to run a Mastodon server (instead of some other ActivityPub
implementation) because Mastodon is the most popular one. Good managed
Mastodon hosting is readily available, there are tons of options for client
apps, and I know for sure that my server will work well with other people’s
servers.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://masto.host/">masto.host</a> for Mastodon hosting, and it’s been great so
far. I have nothing interesting to say about what it’s like to operate a
Mastodon instance because I know literally nothing about it. Masto.host handles
all of the server administration and Mastodon updates, and I never think about
it at all.</p>

<p>Right now I’m on their $19/month (“Star”) plan, but it’s possible I could use a
smaller plan with no problems. Right now their cheapest plan is $6/month and I
expect that would be fine for someone with a smaller account.</p>

<p>Some things I was worried about when embarking on my own Mastodon server:</p>

<ul>
<li>I wanted to run the server at <code>social.jvns.ca</code>, but I wanted my username to
be <code>b0rk@jvns.ca</code> instead of <code>b0rk@social.jvns.ca</code>. To get this to work I
followed these <a href="https://jacobian.org/til/my-mastodon-instance/">Setting up a personal fediverse ID</a> directions from
Jacob Kaplan-Moss and it’s been fine.</li>
<li>The administration burden of running my own server. I imported a small list
of servers to block/defederate from but didn’t do anything else. That’s been
fine.</li>
<li>Reply and profile visibility. This has been annoying and we’ll talk about it next</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="downsides-to-being-on-a-single-person-server">downsides to being on a single-person server</h3>

<p>Being on a 1-person server has some significant downsides. To understand
why, you need to understand a little about how Mastodon works.</p>

<p>Every Mastodon server has a database of posts. Servers only have posts that
they were explicitly sent by another server in their database.</p>

<p>Some reasons that servers might receive posts:</p>

<ul>
<li>someone on the server follows a user</li>
<li>a post mentions someone on the server</li>
</ul>

<p>As a 1-person server, my server does not receive that many posts! I only get
posts from people I follow or posts that explicitly mention me in some way.</p>

<p>The causes several problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>when I visit someone’s profile on Mastodon who I don’t already follow, my
server will not fetch the profile’s content (it’ll fetch their profile
picture, description, and pinned posts, but not any of their post history).
So their profile appears as if they’ve never posted anything</li>
<li>bad reply visibility: when I look at the replies to somebody else’s post
(even if I follow them!), I don’t see all of the replies, only the ones
which have made it to my server. If you want to understand the exact rules
about who can see which replies (which are quite complicated!), <a href="https://seb.jambor.dev/posts/understanding-activitypub-part-3-the-state-of-mastodon/">here’s a great deep dive</a> by Sebastian Jambor.
I think it’s possible to end up in a state where no one person can see all
of the replies, including the original poster.</li>
<li>favourite and boost accounts are inaccurate – usually posts show up having
at most 1 or 2 favourites / boosts, even if the post was actually favourite
or boosted hundreds of times. I think this is because it only counts
favourites/boosts from people I follow.</li>
</ol>

<p>All of these things will happen to users of any small Mastodon server, not just
1-person servers.</p>

<h3 id="bad-reply-visibility-makes-conversations-harder">bad reply visibility makes conversations harder</h3>

<p>A lot of people are on smaller servers, so when they’re participating in a
conversation, they can’t see all the replies to the post.</p>

<p>This means that replies can get pretty repetitive because people literally
cannot see each other’s replies. This is especially annoying for posts that are
popular or controversial, because the person who made the post has to keep
reading similar replies over and over again by people who think they’re making
the point for the first time.</p>

<p>To get around this (as a reader), you can click “open link to post” or something in your
Mastodon client, which will open up the page on the poster’s server where you
can read all of the replies. It’s pretty annoying though.</p>

<p>As a poster, I’ve tried to reduce repetitiveness in replies by:</p>

<ul>
<li>putting requests in my posts like “(no need to reply if you don’t remember, or if you’ve been using the command line comfortably for 15 years — this question isn’t for you :) )”</li>
<li>occasionally editing my posts to include very common replies</li>
<li>very occasionally deleting the post if it gets too out of hand</li>
</ul>

<p>The Mastodon devs are extremely aware of these issues, there are a bunch of github issues about them:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/34">backfill statuses when first subscribed</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/9409">fetch whole conversation threads</a></li>
</ul>

<p>My guess is that there are technical reasons these features are difficult to
add because those issues have been open for 5-7 years.</p>

<h3 id="some-visibility-workarounds">some visibility workarounds</h3>

<p>Some people have built workarounds for fetching profiles / replies.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.thms.uk/fedifetcher">Fedifetcher</a></li>
<li><a href="https://combine.social/">combine.social</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, there are a couple of Mastodon clients which will proactively fetch replies. For iOS:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mammoth does it automatically</li>
<li>Mona will fetch posts if I click “load from remote server” manually</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven’t tried those yet though.</p>

<h3 id="other-downsides-of-running-your-own-server-discovery-is-much-harder">other downsides of running your own server: discovery is much harder</h3>

<p>Mastodon instances have a “local timeline” where you can see everything other
people on the server are posting, and a “federated timeline” which shows sort
of a combined feed from everyone followed by anyone on the server. This means
that you can see trending posts and get an idea of what’s going on and find
people to follow. You don’t get that if you’re on a 1-person
server – it’s just me talking to myself! (plus occasional interjections from
<a href="https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk_reruns">my reruns bot</a>).</p>

<p>Some workarounds people mentioned for this:</p>

<ul>
<li>you can populate your federated timeline with posts from another instance by
using a <strong>relay</strong>. I haven’t done this but someone else said they use
<a href="https://relay.fedi.buzz/">FediBuzz</a> and I might try it out.</li>
<li>some mastodon clients (like apparently Moshidon on Android) let you follow other instances</li>
</ul>

<p>If anyone else on small servers has suggestions for how to make discovery
easier I’d love to hear them.</p>

<h3 id="account-migration">account migration</h3>

<p>When I moved to my own server from <code>mastodon.social</code>, I needed to run an account migration to move over my followers. First, here’s how migration works:</p>

<ol>
<li>Account migration <strong>does not</strong> move over your posts. All of my posts stayed
on my old account. This is part of why I moved to running my own server
– I didn’t want to ever lose my posts a second time.</li>
<li>Account migration <strong>does not</strong> move over the list of people you
follow/mute/block. But you can import/export that list in your Mastodon
settings so it’s not a big deal. If you follow private accounts they’ll have
to re-approve your follow request.</li>
<li>Account migration <strong>does</strong> move over your followers</li>
</ol>

<p>The follower move was the part I was most worried about. Here’s how it turned out:</p>

<ul>
<li>over ~24 hours, most of my followers moved to the new account</li>
<li>one or two servers did not get the message about the account migration for
some reason, so about 2000 followers were “stuck” and didn’t migrate. I
fixed this by waiting 30 days and re-running the account migration, which
moved over most of the remaining followers. There’s also a <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/22281">tootctl command</a> that the admin of
the <strong>old instance</strong> can run to retry the migration</li>
<li>about 200 of my followers never migrated over, I think because they’re using
ActivityPub software other than Mastodon which doesn’t support account
migration. You can see the <a href="https://mastodon.social/@b0rk">old account here</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="using-the-mastodon-api-is-great">using the Mastodon API is great</h3>

<p>One thing I love about Mastodon is – it has an API that’s MUCH easier to use
than Twitter’s API. I’ve always been frustrated with how difficult it is to
navigate large Twitter threads, so I made a small <a href="https://mastodon-thread-view.jvns.ca/">mastodon thread view</a> website that lets you log into
your Mastodon account. It’s pretty janky and it’s really only made for me to
use, but I’ve really appreciated the ability to write my own janky software to
improve my Mastodon experience.</p>

<p>Some notes on the Mastodon API:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can build Mastodon client software totally on the frontend in Javascript, which is really cool.</li>
<li>I couldn’t find a vanilla Javascript Mastodon client, so I <a href="https://github.com/jvns/mastodon-threaded-replies/blob/main/mastodon.js">wrote a crappy one</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/client/intro/">API docs are here</a></li>
<li>Here’s a <a href="https://gist.github.com/jvns/0fe51383cbbb63e94177c60f1e0371c6">tiny Python script I used to list all my Mastodon followers</a>,
which also serves as a simple example of how easy using the API is.</li>
<li>The best documenation I could find for which OAuth scopes correspond to which API endpoints is <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/7929">this github issue</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Next I’ll talk about a few general things about Mastodon that confused or
surprised me that aren’t specific to being on a single-person instance.</p>

<h3 id="dms-are-weird">DMs are weird</h3>

<p>The way Mastodon DMs work surprised me in a few ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Technically DMs are just regular posts with visibility limited to the
people mentioned in the post. This means that if you accidentaly mention
someone in a DM (“@x is such a jerk”), it’s possible to accidentally send the
message to them</li>
<li>DMs aren’t very private: the admins on the sending and receiving servers can
technically read your DMs if they have access to the database. So they’re not
appropriate for sensitive information.</li>
<li>Turning off DMs is weird. Personally I don’t like receiving DMs from
strangers – it’s too much to keep track of and I’d prefer that people email
me. On Twitter, I can just turn it off and people won’t see an option to DM
me. But on Mastodon, when I turn off notifications for DMs, anyone can still
“DM” me, but the message will go into a black hole and I’ll never see it. I
put a note in my profile about this.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="defederation-and-limiting">defederation and limiting</h3>

<p>There are a couple of different ways for a server to block another Mastodon
server. I haven’t really had to do this much but people talk about it a lot and I was confused about the difference, so:</p>

<ul>
<li>A server can <strong>defederate</strong> from another server (this seems to be called <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/moderation/#suspend-server">suspend</a> in the Mastodon docs). This means that nobody on a server can follow someone from the other server.</li>
<li>A server can <strong><a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/moderation/#limit-user">limit</a></strong> (also known as “silence”) a user or server. This means that content from that user is only visible to
that user’s followers – people can’t discover the user through retweets (aka “boosts” on Mastodon).</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing that wasn’t obvious to me is that who servers defederate / limit is
sometimes hidden, so it’s hard to suss out what’s going on if you’re
considering joining a server, or trying to understand why you can’t see certain
posts.</p>

<h3 id="there-s-no-search-for-posts">there’s no search for posts</h3>

<p>There’s no way to search past posts you’ve read. If I see something interesting
on my timeline and want to find it later, I usually can’t. (Mastodon has a
<a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/optional/elasticsearch/">Elasticsearch-based search feature</a>, but it only allows you to search your own posts, your mentions, your
favourites, and your bookmarks)</p>

<p>These limitations on search are intentional (and a very common source of arguments) – it’s a privacy / safety issue.
Here’s a <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/12/30/Mastodon-Privacy-and-Search">summary from Tim Bray</a>
with lots of links.</p>

<p>It would be personally convenient for me to be able to search more easily but I respect folks’ safety concerns so I’ll leave it at that.</p>

<h3 id="other-activitypub-software">other ActivityPub software</h3>

<p>We’ve been talking about Mastodon a lot, but not everyone who I follow is using
Mastodon: Mastodon uses a protocol called <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a> to distribute messages.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of other software I see people talking about, in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://calckey.org/">Calckey</a></li>
<li><a href="https://akkoma.social/">Akkoma</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gotosocial.org/">gotosocial</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jointakahe.org/">Takahē</a></li>
<li><a href="https://writefreely.org/">writefreely</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pixelfed.org/">pixelfed</a> (for images)</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m probably missing a bunch of important ones.</p>

<h3 id="what-s-the-difference-between-mastodon-and-other-activitypub-software">what’s the difference between Mastodon and other ActivityPub software?</h3>

<p>This confused me for a while, and I’m still not super clear on how ActivityPub works. What I’ve understood is:</p>

<ul>
<li>ActivityPub is a protocol (you can explore how it works with blinry’s nice <a href="https://json.blinry.org/#https://chaos.social/users/blinry">JSON explorer</a>)</li>
<li>Mastodon <strong>servers</strong> communicate with each other (and with other ActivityPub servers) using ActivityPub</li>
<li>Mastodon <strong>clients</strong> communicate with their server using the Mastodon API, which is its own thing</li>
<li>There’s also software like <a href="https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial">GoToSocial</a> that aims to be compatible with the Mastodon API, so that you can use a Mastodon client with it</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="more-mastodon-resources">more mastodon resources</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://fedi.tips/">Fedi.Tips</a> seems to be a great introduction</li>
<li>I think you can still use <a href="https://fedifinder.glitch.me/">FediFinder</a> to find folks you followed on Twitter on Mastodon</li>
<li>I’ve been using the <a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a> client on iOS, but
there are lots of great clients. <a href="https://elk.zone/">Elk</a> is an alternative
web client that folks seem to like.</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven’t written here about what Mastodon culture is like because other people
have done a much better job of talking about it than me, but of course it’s is
the biggest thing that affects your experience and it was the thing that took
me longest to get a handle on. A few links:</p>

<ul>
<li>Erin Kissane on <a href="https://erinkissane.com/mastodon-is-easy-and-fun-except-when-it-isnt">frictions people run into when joining Mastodon</a></li>
<li>Kyle Kingsbury wrote some great <a href="https://blog.woof.group/mods/">moderation guidelines for woof.group</a> (note: woof.group is a LGBTQ+ leather instance, be prepared to see lots of NSFW posts if you visit it)</li>
<li>Mekka Okereke writes <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@mekkaokereke/110273797004251326">lots of great posts about issues Black people encounter on Mastodon</a> (though they’re all on Mastodon so it’s a little hard to navigate)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="that-s-all">that’s all!</h3>

<p>I don’t regret setting up a single-user server – even though it’s
inconvenient, it’s important to me to have control over my social media. I
think “have control over my social media” is more important to me than it is to
most other people though, because I use Twitter/Mastodon a lot for work.</p>

<p>I am happy that I didn’t <em>start out</em> on a single-user server though –  I think
it would have made getting started on Mastodon a lot more difficult.</p>

<p>Mastodon is pretty rough around the edges sometimes but I’m able to have more
interesting conversations about computers there than I am on Twitter (or
Bluesky), so that’s where I’m staying for now.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-411044">


<h3>from the <i>getting-on-the-right-side-of-history</i> dept</h3>

<p>Microsoft has long been one of several companies that attempted to monopolize repair in a bid for profit, particularly when it has come to the company’s game consoles. But in recent years the company appears to have realized that with state and federal lawmakers and regulators cracking down on this behavior, it might be smart to stop swimming upstream when it comes to “right to repair.”</p>
<p>Last May, for example, Microsoft began&nbsp;<a href="https://grist.org/technology/microsoft-right-to-repair-quietly-supported-legislation-to-make-it-easier-to-fix-devices-heres-why-thats-a-big-deal/">urging lawmakers</a>&nbsp;to support the Washington State&nbsp;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4006">Fair Repair Act</a>, which would ensure that consumers and indie repair shops have the parts, tools, and documentation to repair their own gear. The <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1392&amp;Initiative=false&amp;Year=2023">bill</a> didn’t pass — in part thanks to Democratic Washington State Senator Lisa Wellman, a former Apple executive (Apple’s a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/01/30/apple-still-sucks-on-right-to-repair/">notorious, bull-headed bully</a> on this subject). </p>
<p>Still, Microsoft’s support was reflective of what seems to be a legitimate shift in tactics at Microsoft, in large part so the company can meet its goal of being <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/">carbon negative</a>&nbsp;by 2030. </p>
<p>Elsewhere, Microsoft has been doing a better job ensuring that consumers have access to both service manuals and essential parts needed to independently repair the company’s hardware, ranging from its Surface tablets and laptops to <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/microsoft-selling-xbox-controller-replacement-parts">Xbox game controllers</a>. </p>
<p>The Microsoft Store <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/xbox-repair-parts">now offers</a> replacement controller boards, buttons, covers, sticks,&nbsp;and more for those looking to fix their own hardware. The company has also started doing a better job providing users with video tutorials on how to best safely repair their own hardware. You can get many of the same parts also from iFixit now (with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/31/23814642/microsoft-xbox-elite-controllers-repair-diy">lifetime warranty as compared to Microsoft’s one-year warranty</a>). </p>
<p>The about face comes as a growing number of states begin seriously pursuing right to repair legislation with an eye on consumer rights, environmental waste, counterproductive DRM, and high repair costs. Given the massive, bipartisan public support for such reform, hopefully Microsoft has genuinely realized it simply makes way more sense to be on the right side of history. </p>

    <p>
    I have worked professionally in Flutter for 3 years now. The company I worked for recently laid me off because of difficulty securing the next round of investment.
  </p><p>
    I am now in the market for a job and the majority of my recent experience is in Flutter. In my country of Canada, I am finding basically zero opportunities. One hiring manager I talked to said "It is hard to find Flutter developers". I am also observing it is nearly impossible to find Flutter positions. So its almost like no one at all is using Flutter.
  </p><p>
    I have a feeling that by the end of 2024, Flutter might be a complete afterthought (though I hope I am completely wrong!).
  </p><p>
    Is anyone seeing a any different trends with Flutter?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>August 2023</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-n5h05z">At a well-run seed stage startup, engineers will often describe the work experience as <em>intoxicating</em>. At a larger company, the best you get is "enjoyable". Why does this happen? Is it inevitable?</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-gpa0nb">Let's inspect what makes a startup intoxicating. An engineer should spend most of their time in
	this core loop:</p> <ol data-svelte-h="svelte-szqb2g"><li>If needed, talk to users, figure out their problems.</li> <li>Come up with an idea to build.</li> <li>If needed, discuss the idea with coworkers.</li> <li>Implement the idea.</li> <li>Cross fingers and ship. Celebrate or postmortem. Then go back to step 1.</li></ol> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1v85j8t">At &lt;10 people, each of these steps can be <em>fun</em>.</p> <ol data-svelte-h="svelte-hgd5la"><li>You can just directly reach out to users you’re interested in and grab a beer with them.</li> <li>If you find an idea that you think is both valuable to the company and interesting to you, you
		can just drop everything to work on it.</li> <li>Almost any coworker will be interested in discussing this idea with you because:
		<ol><li>They have skin in the game. If your idea is good, they benefit from encouraging you to take
				it on. If your idea is bad, they benefit from explaining what’s wrong. They may even care as
				users themselves.</li> <li>They might want to work with you on it.</li> <li>They can likely offer useful insights since everyone’s familiar with a significant chunk of
				the codebase.</li></ol></li> <li>Implementation is quick.
		<ol><li>Choose whatever tools you want, no security review.</li> <li>Small codebase. Can hold the whole thing in your head, so you feel comfortable making
				sweeping refactors. Fast hot reload, so can do quick trial-error debugging.</li> <li>Merge changes quick. No slow tests in CI. No need for blocking PR review for safe changes.
				Maybe just push to master. For unsafe changes, just tap coworker on shoulder for PR review.</li> <li>If not too many users, can tolerate downtime to make breaking backend/database changes
				quickly.</li></ol></li> <li>Anything is possible! Maybe this will make your equity worth something. Maybe people will be
		building upon this feature for years to come, maybe you’ll be seen as a visionary in the history
		books. Maybe you’ll attend a party with your users and hear them say “you came up with this
		idea? OMG it saved my life”. Because everyone in the team has skin in the game, they’re all
		rooting for you. Your hearts are synced.</li></ol> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1kt06hi">As a company scales, the fun is stripped from every one of these steps. At &gt;100 people, the
	loop looks more like this:</p> <ol data-svelte-h="svelte-1a8wj8i"><li>Talking to users is for PMs, silly! You stick to what you’re good at. At best you get a summary
		of user insights and a reasonable task priority list derived from it. At worst you get a
		confusing task list built off a mistaken understanding of users and the manager’s selfish
		vision, and no one can explain why each task matters.</li> <li>You can’t just work on whatever you want; coordinating would be an O(N^2) communication mess.
		Your manager has plans for you that they’ve designed in consideration with everything else going
		on. Maybe you can work on your own idea after you’ve finished all that stuff. Or you can work on
		it secretly in your spare time.</li> <li>You can talk with your coworkers about your idea, but they’re not likely very interested. They
		don’t benefit much from your success; in fact, they might be competing with you for a promotion.
		They’ve got long task lists to do; they don’t have the freedom to drop what they’re doing and
		work with you. And they probably don’t remember much about the code you’re touching anyway.</li> <li>Implementation is slow.
		<ol><li>All the tools have been decided already. There might be better newer tools available, but
				they’re not worth introducing inconsistency. Don’t you <em>dare</em> introduce inconsistency.
				If you want to use something new, ask your manager and email the security review team.</li> <li>Large codebase, mainly for legacy reasons. Lots of code you’re afraid to touch, lots of code
				no one understands anymore. Thorough tests are your only source of confidence that you’re
				not breaking everything. You need to rely on a lot of trial and error debugging, but each
				trial-error loop is slow because the code takes awhile to compile.</li> <li>It takes 2 weeks to get a small PR in. Wait 20 minutes for CI to pass, it flakes, rerun
				tests. Merge conflicts accumulate as you await feedback from a reviewer. The reviewer just
				points out nits because they don’t have enough context or incentive to make important
				suggestions. You make requested changes, push changes, 20 more minutes. Repeat 3x per PR.</li> <li>Making any infrastructure change is a 14 step process, lest you cause downtime or data loss
				for 10 million users.</li></ol></li> <li>After 3 months quietly toiling, you ship something. You get to demo it at a Friday meeting, your
		one chance for the CEO to see what you worked on. Only a few coworkers are really paying
		attention; your work simply doesn’t affect most of them. You get some pats on the back. Your
		manager says this will be big for you on your next perf cycle in 5 months. At best, you get a
		20% salary bump and title change. At worst, in 4 months there’s a reorg, you get a new manager,
		your project gets deprioritized or scrapped. You need to convince the new manager that you’ve
		done stuff at this company.</li></ol> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1yw71b9">Is this preventable? I think not.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1kdvvx6">If you look closely, all these problems fundamentally come from:</p> <ol data-svelte-h="svelte-4ryo71"><li>Decreased skin in the game, which reduces team alignment</li> <li>N^2 communication, which creates need for managers and specialization, which reduces individual
		agency and breadth of learning</li> <li>Reduced risk tolerance, which slows everything down</li></ol> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1rg1ziv">#1 and #2 are inevitable results of having more employees. #3 is an inevitable result of having
	more users, partially due to government regulation.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1yj01ad">However, there are things you can do to slow the death of fun. For one, don’t accelerate it. Most
	startups needlessly accelerate their corporatization by copying the processes of larger companies,
	usually by poaching managers from large companies who bring their playbooks with them. For
	example, many startups use Jira because large companies use Jira. Don’t use Jira. Y Combinator has
	helped the world realize that inspiration should go the other way--large companies should try to
	operate more like startups.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-6ulmyp">Not only are large company playbooks meant for large companies, they’re also outdated. By the time
	your startup gets big, better solutions to many scaling challenges will exist. So when you
	experience scaling pains, try to solve them from first principles, or take inspiration from
	startups that move faster than you despite being the same size.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1nw9j63">You can try to structure your company like a bunch of independent startups. And in fact you should
	do this to the extent that you can; Rippling has somewhat pulled it off. But you typically can’t
	get very far because the components of your product are too tightly interconnected, and most
	components don’t generate any revenue on their own.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-15yg6dt">You can meaningfully slow down #1 by cleverly designing your incentives. I’ll delve into this in
	another blog post. But no incentive is as good as a fat chunk of equity + the power to influence
	its value.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1xf5n7p">Beyond that, your best bet is to hire less. I strongly believe most companies hire too fast due to
	maligned manager incentives, uninformed investors pushing you to look more like other fast-growing
	startups, and not understanding the true cost of a head. And as tools (especially AI) get better,
	the number of users a small team can support increases. Founders of the future may not need to
	worry so much about these scaling pains, and work may become fun for everyone.</p></div></div>]]></description>

It is Meta (Facebook)’s answer to ChatGPT.</p><p>But the two company takes different paths. ChatGPT is proprietary. You don’t know the code of the model, the training data, and the training method. <strong>Llama is an open-source software</strong>. The code, training data, and the training code are out there in the public.</p><p>Llama is the first major open-source large language model. It gains instant popularity upon release. In addition to being free and open-source, it is pretty small and can be run on a personal computer. The 7-billion and 13-billion parameter models are very usable on a good consumer-grade PC.</p><h2><span id="How_does_Llama_work">How does Llama work?</span></h2><p><strong>LLama is an AI model designed to predict the next word.</strong> You can think of it as a glorified autocomplete. It is trained with text from the internet and other public dataset. Llama 2 is trained with about 2 trillion words.</p><p>You may wonder why the Llama model seems to be intelligent: It gives you sensible answers to difficult questions. It can rewrite your essay. It can give you pros and cons of certain things.</p><p>The training text was written by humans. In some sense, they are a slice of human thoughts projected on a medium. By learning how to complete a sentence, the model also learns an aspect of being human.</p><p>Does the Llama model know logic? There are two opposing views. One view is no because what the model designed to learn was correlation. It just predicts the next most probable word. Nothing more. The other view is yes. Suppose the training text is a murder story. It must learn to complete the last sentence, “The murderer is”. To predict the next word accurately, it has no choice but to learn logical deduction.</p><h2><span id="Why_use_LLama_instead_of_ChatGPT">Why use LLama instead of ChatGPT?</span></h2><p>ChatGPT is zero setup. A free version is available. Why use LLama? ChatGPT is indeed highly accessible. Here are the reasons why</p><ul><li><strong>Privacy</strong>. You can use Llama locally on your own computer. You don’t need to worry about the questions you asked being stored in a company’s server indefinitely.</li><li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>. You may not be able to use ChatGPT for work-related queries because you are bounded by a non-disclosure agreement. You don’t have an NDA with OpenAI, after all.</li><li><strong>Customization</strong>. There are many locally finetuned models you can choose from. If you don’t like the answers of a model, you can switch to another one.</li><li><strong>Train your model</strong>. Finally, you have an opportunity to train your own model using techniques such as LoRA.</li></ul><h2><span id="What_can_you_do_with_Llama_models">What can you do with Llama models?</span></h2><p>You can use Llama models the same ways you use ChatGPT.</p><ul><li><strong>Chat</strong>. Just ask questions about things you want to know.</li><li><strong>Coding</strong>. Ask for a short program to do something in a specific computer language.</li><li><strong>Outlines</strong>. Giving an outline of certain technical topics.</li><li><strong> Creative writing</strong>. Let the model write a story for you.</li><li><strong>Information extraction</strong>. Summarize an essay. Ask specific questions about an essay.</li><li><strong> Rewrite</strong>. Write your paragraph in a different tone and style.</li></ul><figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-12-1024x683.png" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-12.png?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-12.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-12.png?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-12.png?resize=930%2C620&amp;ssl=1 930w, https://i0.wp.com/agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-12.png?w=1344&amp;ssl=1 1344w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-12-1024x683.png" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-12.png?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-12.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-12.png?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-12.png?resize=930%2C620&amp;ssl=1 930w, https://i0.wp.com/agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-12.png?w=1344&amp;ssl=1 1344w"></figure><h2><span id="What_language_does_Llama_support">What language does Llama support?</span></h2><p>Mostly English.

This release caused a big excitement because it was the first important LLM that was open-source. It was a big surprise back then, but now it seems like it was a long time ago. Llama 1 has spurred many efforts to fine-tune and optimize the model to run it locally. It was initially thought to be impossible to run a LLM locally. It was solved in a short period of time by hobbyists.</p><h4><span id="Llama_2">Llama 2</span></h4><p>Although holding great promise, Llama 1 was released with a license that does not allow commercial use. This has limited the adoption of the Llama 1 model.</p><p><strong><a href="https://agi-sphere.com/llama-2/" data-type="post" data-id="698">LLama 2</a></strong> came out in July 2023. There are some incremental improvements in training and model architecture. The most significant change is the license term. Llama 2 is now free for commercial use.  It is widely expected that this will spark a new round of development like what happened with<a href="https://stable-diffusion-art.com/beginners-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Stable Diffuison</a>.</p><h3><span id="Fine-tuned_models">Fine-tuned models</span></h3><p>Unlike ChatGPT, you can make your own Llama model if you are unhappy with its response.

The crew disconnected the autoflight system, assumed manual control of the aircraft, re-established the aircraft on the localizer about 12nm before the runway threshold and landed safely.<p>On Mar 6th 2020 Hong Kong's AAIA reported under the headline "Loss of Control - Inflight" the occurrence was rated a serious incident and opened an investigation.</p><p>There had been other similiar occurrences, see <a href="https://avherald.com/h?article=4d42cd8c&amp;opt=0" target="_blank">Incident: Virgin Atlantic B789 at Hong Kong on Sep 29th 2019, deviated from localizer and descended below minimum safe altitude</a>, <a href="https://avherald.com/h?article=4d41981b&amp;opt=0" target="_blank">Incident: Etihad B789 at Hong Kong on Sep 7th 2019, veered off localizer and descended below safe height on ILS approach</a> and <a href="https://avherald.com/h?article=4d03a5fe&amp;opt=0">Incident: Ethiopian B788 at Hong Kong on Jul 18th 2019, loss of control on ILS approach</a>.</p><p>In response to the occurrences Boeing released a bulletin in December 2019 addressing the issues (see below).</p><p>On Aug 11th 2023 Hong Kong's AAIA released their <a href="https://www.tlb.gov.hk/aaia/doc/Investigation%20Report%206-2023.pdf" target="_blank">final report</a> into this occurrence as well as three more similiar occurrences concluding the probable cause of this serious incident was:</p><p><i>The LOC course deviation was caused by the software failure of the CLC autoflight function in the AFDS.</i></p><p>The AAIA analysed:</p><p><i>During the investigation of this occurrence, another operator encountered a similar occurrence on the B787 at VHHH on 7 September 2019. The flight data of this flight was sent to Boeing, the aircraft manufacture, for analysis. These two occurrences appeared to be identical and Boeing was able to determine the root cause.<p>Evaluation of the flight data suggested that the CLC AFF initiated the turn towards the RWY 25R LOC, as LOC annunciated the active roll mode.</p><p>After the CLC AFF had initiated the turn, the A/P transition to the LOC mode did not occur. This resulted in the aircraft HDG stabilised 20 degrees short of the LOC course and flying through the LOC course on this track, rather than properly capturing the LOC.</p><p>The recorded flight data was consistent with the LOC capture anomaly of the AFDS as described in the FTD 787-FTD-22-20001.</p><p>The LOC course deviation observed was due to the LOC capture anomaly of the AFDS.</p><p>The FTD stipulated that the issuance of a Flight Crew Operations Manual Bulletin and related FAA AD 2020-24-04, associated with the software modification released by Boeing via Alert SB B787-81205-SB270053-00 addressed this anomaly.</p></i></p><p>Metars:<br>VHHH 181000Z 32009KT CAVOK 28/17 Q1015 NOSIG=<br>VHHH 180930Z 32010KT CAVOK 28/17 Q1015 NOSIG=<br>VHHH 180900Z 31010KT CAVOK 28/17 Q1015 NOSIG=<br>VHHH 180830Z 31010KT 9999 FEW040 29/17 Q1015 NOSIG=<br><b>VHHH 180800Z 30010KT 9999 FEW040 29/17 Q1015 NOSIG=</b><br><b>VHHH 180730Z 30010KT 9999 FEW035 29/17 Q1015 NOSIG=</b><br>VHHH 180700Z 30010KT 9999 FEW035 29/17 Q1015 NOSIG=<br>VHHH 180630Z 31008KT 280V340 9999 FEW035 29/16 Q1015 NOSIG=<br>VHHH 180600Z 30008KT 9999 FEW035 29/17 Q1016 NOSIG=<br>VHHH 180530Z 31008KT 280V340 9999 FEW035 29/16 Q1016 NOSIG=<br>VHHH 180500Z 31010KT 9999 FEW030 28/16 Q1017 NOSIG=<br>VHHH 180430Z 31011KT 9999 FEW030 28/17 Q1017 NOSIG=<br>VHHH 180400Z 34009KT 9999 FEW030 28/16 Q1017 NOSIG=</p><p>Boeing Bulletin:<br><img src="https://avherald.com/img/boeing_b787_bulletin_localizer_capture_anomalies_1.jpg" width="750" height="769" alt="Boeing Bulletin Page 1"></p><p><img src="https://avherald.com/img/boeing_b787_bulletin_localizer_capture_anomalies_2.jpg" width="750" height="810" alt="Boeing Bulletin Page 2"></p><p>Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth):<br><img src="https://avherald.com/img/virgin_b789_g-vbow_191018_map.jpg" width="750" height="469" alt="Map (Graphics: AVH/Google Earth)"></p><p>ILS Runway 25R Chart of October 2019 effective since May 23rd 2019 (Graphics: eAIP Hong Kong):<br><img src="https://avherald.com/img/vhhh_ils_rwy25r_1910.jpg" width="750" height="1183" alt="ILS Runway 25R Chart of October 2019 effective since May 23rd 2019 (Graphics: eAIP Hong Kong)"></p></span></p></div></div></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://modelz.ai/blog/pgvector">https://modelz.ai/blog/pgvector</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37097004">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-fc514029=""><p><!--[-->With the popularity of LLM (Large Language Model), vector databases have also become a hot topic. With just a few lines of simple Python code, a vector database can act as a cheap but highly effective "external brain" for your LLM. But do we really need a specialized vector database?<!--]--></p><h2 id="why-does-llm-need-vector-search"><a href="#why-does-llm-need-vector-search"><!--[-->Why does LLM need vector search?<!--]--></a></h2><p><!--[-->First, let me briefly introduce why LLM needs to use vector search technology. Vector search is a problem that has been around for a long time. The process of finding the most similar object in a collection given an object is vector search. Text/images, etc. can be converted into a vector representation, and the similarity problem of text/images can be transformed into a vector similarity problem.<!--]--></p><figure><p><img src="https://modelz.ai/blog-images/pgvector/text.png"></p><figcaption><!--[-->Text search (<a href="https://docs.relevanceai.com/docs/what-is-vector-search" rel="nofollow"><!--[-->credit<!--]--></a>)<!--]--></figcaption></figure><p><!--[-->In the example above, we convert different words into a three-dimensional vector. Therefore, we can intuitively display the similarity between different words in a 3D space. For example, the similarity between "student" and "school" is higher than the similarity between "student" and "food".<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Returning to LLM, the limitation of the context window length is a major challenge. For instance, ChatGPT 3.5 has a context length limit of 4k tokens. This poses a significant problem for LLM's context-learning ability and negatively impacts the model's user experience. However, vector search provides an elegant solution to this problem:<!--]--></p><ul><!--[--><li><!--[-->Divide the text that exceeds the context length limit into shorter chunks and convert different chunks into vectors (embeddings).<!--]--></li><li><!--[-->Before inputting the prompt to LLM, convert the prompt into a vector (embedding).<!--]--></li><li><!--[-->Search the prompt vector to find the most similar chunk vector.<!--]--></li><li><!--[-->Concatenate the most similar chunk vector with the prompt vector as the input to LLM.<!--]--></li><!--]--></ul><p><!--[-->This is like giving LLM an external memory, which allows it to search for the most relevant information from this memory. This memory is the ability brought by vector search. If you want to learn more details, you can read these articles (<a href="https://simplicityissota.substack.com/p/what-is-an-embedding-anyways" rel="nofollow"><!--[-->Article 1<!--]--></a> and <a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/enhancing-chatgpt-with-infinite-external-memory-using-vector-database-and-chatgpt-retrieval-plugin-b6f4ea16ab8" rel="nofollow"><!--[-->Article 2<!--]--></a>), which explain it more clearly.<!--]--></p><h2 id="why-is-vector-database-so-popular"><a href="#why-is-vector-database-so-popular"><!--[-->Why is vector database so popular?<!--]--></a></h2><p><!--[-->In LLM, the vector database has become an indispensable part, and one of the most important reasons is its ease of use. After being used in conjunction with OpenAI Embedding models (such as <code><!--[-->text-embedding-ada-002<!--]--></code>), it only takes about ten lines of code to convert a prompt query into a vector and perform the entire process of vector search.<!--]--></p><!--[--><pre><code><span line="1"><span>def</span><span> </span><span>query</span><span>(query, collection_name, top_k</span><span>=</span><span>20</span><span>):

Simply put, recall is finding the most similar objects in a candidate set. In LLM, the candidate set is all chunks, and the most similar object is the chunk that is most similar to the prompt. In the reasoning process of LLM, vector search is regarded as the main implementation of recall. It is easy to implement and can use OpenAI Embedding models to solve the most troublesome problem of converting text into vectors. The remaining part is an independent and clean vector search problem, which can be well completed by current vector databases. Therefore, the entire process is particularly smooth.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->As the name suggests, vector database is a database specifically designed for the special data type of vectors. The similarity calculation of vectors was originally an O(n^2) complexity problem because it required comparing all vectors in the set pairwise. Therefore, the industry proposed the Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithm. By using the ANN algorithm, the vector index is constructed by pre-calculating in the vector database, using the idea of trading space for time, which greatly speeds up the process of similarity calculation. This is similar to the index in traditional databases.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Therefore, vector databases not only have strong performance but also excellent ease of use, making them a perfect match for LLM! (Really?)<!--]--></p><h2 id="perhaps-a-general-purpose-database-would-be-better"><a href="#perhaps-a-general-purpose-database-would-be-better"><!--[-->Perhaps a general-purpose database would be better?<!--]--></a></h2><p><!--[-->We've talked about the advantages and benefits of vector databases, but what are their limitations? <a href="https://www.singlestore.com/blog/why-your-vector-database-should-not-be-a-vector-database/" rel="nofollow"><!--[-->A blog post by SingleStore<!--]--></a> provides a good answer to this question:<!--]--></p><blockquote><!--[--><p><!--[-->Vectors and vector search are a data type and query processing approach, not a foundation for a new way of processing data. Using a specialty vector database (SVDB) will lead to the usual problems we see (and solve) again and again with our customers who use multiple specialty systems: redundant data, excessive data movement, lack of agreement on data values among distributed components, extra labor expense for specialized skills, extra licensing costs, limited query language power, programmability and extensibility, limited tool integration, and poor data integrity and availability compared with a true DBMS.<!--]--></p><!--]--></blockquote><p><!--[-->There are two issues that I think are important. The first is the issue of data consistency. During the prototyping phase, vector databases are very suitable, and ease of use is more important than anything else. However, a vector database is an independent system that is completely decoupled from other data storage systems such as TP databases and AP data lakes. Therefore, data needs to be synchronized, streamed, and processed between multiple systems.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Imagine if your data is already stored in an OLTP database such as PostgreSQL. To perform vector search using an independent vector database, you need to first extract the data from the database, then convert each data point into a vector using services such as OpenAI Embedding, and then synchronize it to a dedicated vector database. This adds a lot of complexity. Furthermore, if a user deletes a data point in PostgreSQL but it is not deleted in the vector database, then there will be data inconsistency issues. This issue can be very serious in actual production environments.<!--]--></p><!--[--><pre><code><span line="1"><span>-- Update the embedding column for the documents table

Vectors are just one data type in a general-purpose database, not an independent system. This way, data consistency is no longer an issue.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->The second issue is with query language. The query language of vector databases is typically designed specifically for vector search, so there may be many limitations in other types of queries. For example, in metadata filtering scenarios, users need to filter based on certain metadata fields. The filtering operators supported by some vector databases are limited.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In addition, the supported data types for metadata are also very limited, usually only including String, Number, List of Strings, and Booleans. This is not friendly for complex metadata queries.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->If traditional databases can support the vector data type, then the aforementioned issues do not exist. Firstly, data consistency is already taken care of as TP or AP databases are existing infrastructure in production environments. Secondly, the issue of query language no longer exists because vector data type is just one data type in the database, so queries for vector data type can use the native query language of the database, such as SQL.<!--]--></p><h2 id="detailed-explanation"><a href="#detailed-explanation"><!--[-->Detailed explanation<!--]--></a></h2><p><!--[-->However, it is unfair to only compare the disadvantages of vector databases. There are several counterpoints to consider:<!--]--></p><ul><!--[--><li><!--[--><strong><!--[-->Ease of Use<!--]--></strong>: Vector databases are designed with ease of use in mind, and users can easily work with them without worrying about the underlying implementation details. However, integrating them with other data storage systems can be a challenge, as mentioned earlier.<!--]--></li><li><!--[--><strong><!--[-->Performance<!--]--></strong>: Vector databases have a significant advantage over traditional databases in terms of performance for certain use cases. Their design for vector search allows for fast and efficient similarity searches on large-scale datasets with high-dimensional vectors.<!--]--></li><li><!--[--><strong><!--[-->Metadata Filtering<!--]--></strong>: While metadata filtering capabilities in vector databases may be limited, they can still meet the needs of most business scenarios. However, for more complex metadata queries, a hybrid approach may be needed, where metadata is stored in a separate database or data lake and linked to the vector data in the vector database.<!--]--></li><!--]--></ul><p><!--[-->How can you address these issues? In the following section, I will provide my perspective by answering these questions.<!--]--></p><h3 id="vector-databases-are-easy-to-use"><a href="#vector-databases-are-easy-to-use"><!--[-->Vector databases are easy to use<!--]--></a></h3><p><!--[-->While it is true that vector databases are easy to use, this is not unique to them. The ease of use of vector databases is mainly due to their abstraction of a specific domain, which allows them to be specifically designed for the most commonly used machine learning programming language, Python, and optimized for vector search scenarios. However, if traditional databases could also support the vector data type, they could offer similar ease of use.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In addition, traditional databases can provide Python SDKs and other integrated tools to meet the needs of most scenarios, as well as standard SQL interfaces to handle more complex query scenarios. Therefore, it is not necessary to use a vector database solely for its ease of use.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Another advantage of vector databases is their distributed design, which allows them to scale horizontally to meet the data volume and QPS requirements of users. However, traditional databases can also meet these requirements through distributed systems. Nevertheless, the decision to use a distributed system should be based on the actual needs of the data volume and QPS requirements, as well as the associated costs.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In summary, while vector databases have their advantages, traditional databases can also provide similar ease of use and distributed capabilities if they support the vector data type. Therefore, the choice between a vector database and a traditional database should be based on the specific needs of the application and the available resources.<!--]--></p><h3 id="vector-databases-have-better-performance"><a href="#vector-databases-have-better-performance"><!--[-->Vector databases have better performance<!--]--></a></h3><p><!--[-->To investigate the performance of vector databases in LLM scenarios, a <a href="https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/2023/04/10/nn-vs-ann/" rel="nofollow"><!--[-->naive benchmark<!--]--></a> of vector retrieval was conducted. The benchmark involved N randomly initialized 256-dimensional vectors, and the query time for the top-5 nearest neighbors was measured for different scales of N. Two different methods were used for the test:<!--]--></p><ul><!--[--><li><!--[-->Numpy was used to perform <strong><!--[-->real-time<!--]--></strong> calculation, which executed completely accurate, non-precomputed nearest neighbor calculation.<!--]--></li><li><!--[-->Hnswlib was used to <strong><!--[-->precompute approximate<!--]--></strong> nearest neighbors.<!--]--></li><!--]--></ul><figure><p><img src="https://modelz.ai/blog-images/pgvector/benchmark.png"></p><figcaption><!--[-->Benchmark (<a href="https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/2023/04/10/nn-vs-ann/" rel="nofollow"><!--[-->credit<!--]--></a>)<!--]--></figcaption></figure><p><!--[-->The benchmark results show that, at the scale of 1 million vectors, the delay of real-time calculation using Numpy is approximately 50ms. Using this as a benchmark, we can compare the time spent on LLM inference after completing vector search. For instance, the 7B model requires approximately 10 seconds for inference on 300 Chinese characters on an Nvidia A100 (40GB). Therefore, even if the query time for real-time accurate calculation of the similarity of 1 million vectors using Numpy is considered, it only accounts for 0.5% of the total delay in the end-to-end LLM inference. Thus, in terms of delay, the benefits brought by vector databases may be overshadowed by the delay of LLM itself in the current LLM scenario. Therefore, we need to also consider throughput. The throughput of LLM is much lower than that of vector databases. Thus, I do not believe that throughput is the core issue in this scenario.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->If performance is not the primary concern, what factors will determine the user's choice? I think it is the overall ease of use, including ease of use for both usage and operation, consistency, and other solutions to database-related issues. Traditional databases have mature solutions for these problems, while vector databases are still in the early stages of development.<!--]--></p><h3 id="metadata-filtering-can-still-meet-the-needs-of-most-business-scenarios"><a href="#metadata-filtering-can-still-meet-the-needs-of-most-business-scenarios"><!--[-->Metadata filtering can still meet the needs of most business scenarios<!--]--></a></h3><p><!--[-->When considering metadata filtering, it's important to note that it's not just a matter of the number of supported operators. Consistency of data is also a crucial factor. Metadata in vectors is essentially data in traditional databases, while vectors themselves are indexes of the data. Therefore, it's reasonable to consider storing both vectors and metadata in traditional databases.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Traditional databases do have the capability to support vector data types and provide similar ease of use and distributed capabilities as vector databases. Furthermore, traditional databases have mature solutions to ensure data consistency and integrity, such as transaction management and data backup and recovery.<!--]--></p><h2 id="vectors-in-traditional-databases"><a href="#vectors-in-traditional-databases"><!--[-->Vectors in traditional databases<!--]--></a></h2><p><!--[-->Since we see vectors as a new data type in traditional databases, let's take a look at how to support vector data types in traditional databases, using PostgreSQL as an example. <a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector" rel="nofollow"><!--[-->pgvector<!--]--></a> is an open-source PostgreSQL plugin that supports vector data types. pgvector uses exact calculation by default, but it also supports building an IVFFlat index and precomputing ANN results using the IVFFlat algorithm, sacrificing calculation accuracy for performance.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->pgvector has done an excellent job of supporting vectors and is used by products such as <a href="https://supabase.com/blog/openai-embeddings-postgres-vector" rel="nofollow"><!--[-->supabase<!--]--></a>. However, the supported index algorithm is limited, with only the simplest IVFFlat algorithm supported, and no quantization or storage optimization is implemented. Moreover, the index algorithm of pgvector is not disk-friendly and is designed for use in memory. Therefore, vector index algorithms designed for disk, such as <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/09853c7fb1d3f8ee67a61b6bf4a7f8e6-Paper.pdf" rel="nofollow"><!--[-->DiskANN<!--]--></a>, are also valuable in the traditional database ecosystem.<!--]--></p><figure><p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FF8KN7cXsBAGOLj.jpg"></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><!--[-->Extending pgvector can be challenging due to its implementation in the C programming language.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">List of "Hidden" Tricks</h2>

<p dir="auto">Below things are already inside the software, and <strong>users do not need to do anything about these</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that some of these tricks are currently (2023 Aug 11) impossible to reproduce in Automatic1111's interface or ComfyUI's node system. You may expect better results from Fooocus than other software even when they use similar models/pipelines.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Native refiner swap inside one single k-sampler. The advantage is that now the refiner model can reuse the base model's momentum (or ODE's history parameters) collected from k-sampling to achieve more coherent sampling. In Automatic1111's high-res fix and ComfyUI's node system, the base model and refiner use two independent k-samplers, which means the momentum is largely wasted, and the sampling continuity is broken. Fooocus uses its own advanced k-diffusion sampling that ensures seamless, native, and continuous swap in a refiner setup.</li>
<li>Negative ADM guidance. Because the highest resolution level of XL Base does not have cross attentions, the positive and negative signals for XL's highest resolution level cannot receive enough contrasts during the CFG sampling, causing the results look a bit plastic or overly smooth in certain cases. Fortunately, since the XL's highest resolution level is still conditioned on image aspect ratios (ADM), we can modify the adm on the positive/negative side to compensate for the lack of CFG contrast in the highest resolution level.</li>
<li>We modified the style templates a bit and added the "cinematic-default".</li>
<li>We tested the "sd_xl_offset_example-lora_1.0.safetensors" and it seems that when the lora weight is below 0.5, the results are always better than XL without lora.</li>
<li>The parameters of samplers are carefully tuned.</li>
<li>Because XL uses positional encoding for generation resolution, images generated by several fixed resolutions look a bit better than that from arbitrary resolutions (because the positional encoding is not very good at handling int numbers that are unseen during training). This suggests that the resolutions in UI may be hard coded for best results.</li>
<li>Separated prompts for two different text encoders seem unnecessary. Separated prompts for base model and refiner may work but the effects are random, and we refrain from implement this.</li>
<li>DPM family seems well-suited for XL, since XL sometimes generates overly smooth texture but DPM family sometimes generate overly dense detail in texture. Their joint effect looks neutral and appealing to human perception.</li>
</ol>

<p>Four months after the disappointing decision on summary judgment in <em>Hachette v. Internet Archive</em>, a number of <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17211300/hachette-book-group-inc-v-internet-archive/?order_by=desc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">papers were filed today</a> in the district court,&nbsp;and then the judge is expected to make his final judgment. We expect that, at least while the appeal is pending, there will be changes to our lending program, but the full scope of those changes is a question pending with the district court. We will provide an update on those changes once the district court decision is final.</p>



<p><strong>Our fight is far from over—</strong>We remain steadfast in our belief that libraries should be able to own, preserve, and lend digital books outside of the confines of temporary licensed access. We believe that the judge made errors of law and fact in the decision, and we will appeal.</p>



<p><strong>Statement from Internet Archive founder, Brewster Kahle:</strong><br>“Libraries are under attack at unprecedented scale today, from book bans to defunding to overzealous lawsuits like the one brought against our library. These efforts are cutting off the public’s access to truth at a key time in our democracy. We must have strong libraries, which is why we are appealing this decision.”</p>

                                    <p>MARION — In an unprecedented raid Friday, local law enforcement seized computers, cellphones and reporting materials from the <a target="_blank" href="http://marionrecord.com/">Marion County Record</a> office, the newspaper’s reporters, and the publisher’s home.</p>
<p>Eric Meyer, owner and publisher of the newspaper, said police were motivated by a confidential source who leaked sensitive documents to the newspaper, and the message was clear: “Mind your own business or we’re going to step on you.”</p>
<p>The city’s entire five-officer police force and two sheriff’s deputies took “everything we have,” Meyer said, and it wasn’t clear how the newspaper staff would take the weekly publication to press Tuesday night.</p>
<p>The raid followed news stories about a restaurant owner who kicked reporters out of a meeting last week with U.S. Rep. Jake LaTurner, and revelations about the restaurant owner’s lack of a driver’s license and conviction for drunken driving.</p>
<p>Meyer said he had never heard of police raiding a newspaper office during his 20 years at the Milwaukee Journal or 26 years teaching journalism at the University of Illinois.</p>
<p>“It’s going to have a chilling effect on us even tackling issues,” Meyer said, as well as “a chilling effect on people giving us information.”</p>
<p>The search warrant, signed by Marion County District Court Magistrate Judge Laura Viar, appears to violate <a target="_blank" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000aa">federal law</a> that provides protections against searching and seizing materials from journalists. The law requires law enforcement to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcguirewoods.com/news-resources/publications/media.0101.pdf">subpoena materials instead</a>. Viar didn’t respond to a request to comment for this story or explain why she would authorize a potentially illegal raid.</p>
<p>Emily Bradbury, executive director of the Kansas Press Association, said the police raid is unprecedented in Kansas.</p>
<p>“An attack on a newspaper office through an illegal search is not just an infringement on the rights of journalists but an assault on the very foundation of democracy and the public’s right to know,” Bradbury said. “This cannot be allowed to stand.”</p>
<p>Meyer reported last week that Marion restaurant owner Kari Newell had kicked newspaper staff out of a public forum with LaTurner, whose staff was apologetic. Newell responded to Meyer’s reporting with hostile comments on her personal Facebook page.</p>
<p>A confidential source contacted the newspaper, Meyer said, and provided evidence that Newell had been convicted of drunken driving and continued to use her vehicle without a driver’s license. The criminal record could jeopardize her efforts to obtain a liquor license for her catering business.</p>
<p>A reporter with the Marion Record used a state website to verify the information provided by the source. But Meyer suspected the source was relaying information from Newell’s husband, who had filed for divorce. Meyer decided not to publish a story about the information, and he alerted police to the situation.</p>
<p>“We thought we were being set up,” Meyer said.</p>
<p>Police notified Newell, who then complained at a city council meeting that the newspaper had illegally obtained and disseminated sensitive documents, which isn’t true. Her public comments prompted the newspaper to set the record straight in a story published Thursday.</p>

<p>Sometime before 11 a.m. Friday, officers showed up simultaneously at Meyer’s home and the newspaper office. They presented a search warrant that alleges identity theft and unlawful use of a computer.</p>
<p>The search warrant identifies two pages worth of items that law enforcement officers were allowed to seize, including computer software and hardware, digital communications, cellular networks, servers and hard drives, items with passwords, utility records, and all documents and records pertaining to Newell. The warrant specifically targeted ownership of computers capable of being used to “participate in the identity theft of Kari Newell.”</p>
<p>Officers injured a reporter’s finger by grabbing her cellphone out of her hand, Meyer said. Officers at his home took photos of his bank account information.</p>
<p>He said officers told him the computers, cellphones and other devices would be sent to a lab.</p>
<p>“I don’t know when they’ll get it back to us,” Meyer said. “They won’t tell us.”</p>
<p>The seized computers, server and backup hard drive include advertisements and legal notices that were supposed to appear in the next edition of the newspaper.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what we’re going to do,” he said. “We will publish something.”</p>
<p>Newell, writing Friday under a changed name on her personal Facebook account, said she “foolishly” received a DUI in 2008 and “knowingly operated a vehicle without a license out of necessity.”</p>
<p>“Journalists have become the dirty politicians of today, twisting narrative for bias agendas, full of muddied half-truths,” Newell wrote. “We rarely get facts that aren’t baited with misleading insinuations.”</p>
<p>She said the “entire debacle was brought forth in an attempt to smear my name, jeopardize my licensing through ABC (state Alcoholic Beverage Control Division), harm my business, seek retaliation, and for personal leverage in an ongoing domestic court battle.”</p>
<p>At the law enforcement center in Marion, a staff member said only Police Chief Gideon Cody could answer questions for this story, and that Cody had gone home for the day and could not be reached by phone. The office of Attorney General Kris Kobach wasn’t available to comment on the legal controversy in Marion, which is north of Wichita in central Kansas.</p>
<p>Melissa Underwood, communications director of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, replied by email to a question about whether the KBI was involved in the case.</p>
<p>“At the request of the Marion Police Department, on Tuesday, Aug. 8, we began an investigation into allegations of criminal wrongdoing in Marion, Kansas. The investigation is ongoing,” Underwood said.</p>
<p>Meyer, whose father worked at the newspaper from 1948 until he retired, bought the Marion County Record in 1998, preventing a sale to a corporate newspaper chain.</p>
<p>As a journalism professor in Illinois, Meyer said, he had graduate students from Egypt who talked about how people would come into the newspaper office and seize everything so they couldn’t publish. Those students presented a scholarly paper at a conference in Toronto about what it has done to journalism there.</p>
<p>“That’s basically what they’re trying to do here,” Meyer said. “The intervention is just like that repressive government of Egypt. I didn’t think it could happen in America.”</p>
