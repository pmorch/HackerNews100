<p dir="auto">This is the repository for an ESP32 based pomodoro timer. It uses an ePaper display and a rotary dial for input.
The code in this repository will not be ready-to-use, as some assets and fonts have been removed. However, if you really want to you should be able to adapt the code to your needs.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Project Origin</h2><a id="user-content-project-origin" aria-label="Permalink: Project Origin" href="#project-origin"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I love trying out different productivity techniques - some say that the quest to optimize your productivity is the ultimate procrastination method, so maybe that is what drove me to this project. I also have a habit of committing time (around a month of work outside my normal job) once a year to a project that benefits someone else. Last year, I bought a 3D printer (BambuLab X1C) and wanted to put it to good use. I have previously finished an apprenticeship as an electronics
engineer before pivoting to software engineering, so I also wanted to come back to my roots and build something physical.
My friend struggles with time management throughout the day sometimes - lots of different tasks to organize, and little focus. So I thought to myself: Why not make them a pomodoro timer? So, I set out with a few goals:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It should be a physical device</li>
<li>It should be <em>fun</em></li>
<li>It should be intuitive to use</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">There are some cool projects out there (arguably much cooler than this, for example the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZa-Vqu-_fU" rel="nofollow">Focus Dial by Salim Benbouziyane</a>), but I wanted to build something from scratch. I also
never built something with an ePaper display and thought it might be a good fit for something that is mostly idling and doesn't require a backlight.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why these parts?</h3><a id="user-content-why-these-parts" aria-label="Permalink: Why these parts?" href="#why-these-parts"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This was my second dive back into building things with microcontrollers in a long time. I knew ESP32 well enough to feel comfortable diving back in, so that was the main choice here. I did some research before to see what kinds of displays would be supported.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">ePaper Display</h4><a id="user-content-epaper-display" aria-label="Permalink: ePaper Display" href="#epaper-display"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I needed some sort of display, or at least I <em>wanted</em> some sort of display. One of the main motivations for this project was that it should be out of your way - until it is time to finish your current focus and move on. For me, this meant that I wanted a display without any backlight.</p>
<p dir="auto">The display should also be large enough that you can put the whole device somewhere on your desk and still be able to read it. After ordering and playing around with a few WaveShare ePaper displays, I settled on the 4.26" variant for multiple reasons:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Great resolution (which seems to be really hard to find for "hobbyist" displays)</li>
<li>The size felt right</li>
<li>The display supports partial refreshes (0.3s, no distracting "black and white flashes" while refreshing)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Initially, I really wanted to use a black/white/red display and found one that I liked, but the refresh time
was a whopping 16 seconds with no support for partial refreshes which was a dealbreaker for me.</p>
<p dir="auto">The final bonus feature: it won't work at night. If your desk is not bright enough, you won't be able to read the display. This is a feature, not a bug. Too dark outside? Stop working already!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Rotary Encoder</h4><a id="user-content-rotary-encoder" aria-label="Permalink: Rotary Encoder" href="#rotary-encoder"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">From the start, I knew that I wanted some sort of dial as an input - it made the most sense to me. This came at the cost of some complexity when designing the menus, and you really need to make sure that you debounce the input correctly. I also added .1uF capacitors to the CLK and DT pins to help with smoothing out the signal.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">LED</h4><a id="user-content-led" aria-label="Permalink: LED" href="#led"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In the first few iterations, there was no plan for an LED. My genius plan of having a display without backlight came at a cost: it could be <em>too</em> subtle when your current focus time ended. I experimented with a few different ideas:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A buzzer: this would just make you jump. A truly horrible experience</li>
<li>Speakers: I don't know why, but speakers felt <em>hard</em>. So much noise and whining with the setup I tried, but I will blame this on a skill issue</li>
<li>LED: I had some WS2812 LEDs lying around and thought they might be a good fit. You can animate them with the NeoPixel library, and they are really easy to use. The additional benefit of not needing to commit many more output pins was also a big plus</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Rukenshia/pomodoro/blob/main/docs/led_shroud.png"><img src="https://github.com/Rukenshia/pomodoro/raw/main/docs/led_shroud.png" alt="LED shroud screenshot of the CAD model"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The LED ended up working great, allowing me to display different states. It might be subtle, but I also added a little shroud to the case and added a diffusion layer in front of the LED to make it look nicer.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building the Case</h3><a id="user-content-building-the-case" aria-label="Permalink: Building the Case" href="#building-the-case"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The case comes in two parts: the base and a lid. One unfortunate design choice I made is that the display frame is printed as one piece as part of the base, so the top edge tends to warp a little bit during printing. Since CAD (or product design) isn't my strongest suit, there will certainly be better choices to design this for a better final look.</p>
<p dir="auto">One thing that I wished I learned earlier is that it might not have been the best idea to put the dial in the front: because the print and electronics are so lightweight, pressing the switch on the dial will tend to just slide the whole device back. Luckily, I could solve this by adding some rubber feet and weights (the ones usually used to balance tires) to the bottom of the case. This worked out great, and I am happy with how it turned out.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Software</h3><a id="user-content-software" aria-label="Permalink: Software" href="#software"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The software is written in C++ and uses the Arduino framework. I used PlatformIO to manage the project (at least that is what seemed to be a popular choice, but I am not so sure about that anymore). This project relies heavily
on the GxEPD2 library for the display. I won't lie, the code in this repository is a bit of a mess - I had to get things done in time, which led to quite a bit of copy and pasting and not revisiting earlier parts of the code.
Some parts were generated by AI (Claude, for the most part) to help me finish the project in the deadline I set myself.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Rukenshia/pomodoro/blob/main/docs/timer_running.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/Rukenshia/pomodoro/raw/main/docs/timer_running.jpg" alt="a random fact displayed on the screen"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Since this was a project for my friend, I also wanted to include some easter eggs and fun. You would think that adding some random facts <em>while you are supposed to be focused</em> would be a bad idea, but I think it is a fun little addition.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using the Device</h2><a id="user-content-using-the-device" aria-label="Permalink: Using the Device" href="#using-the-device"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When the device starts up, you can either change some settings or go into preset selection mode. From there, you can choose one of three presets:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Rukenshia/pomodoro/blob/main/docs/select_preset.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/Rukenshia/pomodoro/raw/main/docs/select_preset.jpg" alt="preset selection"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The timer will then start and let you know once the time is up (by flashing the LED and displaying a message on the screen). You can keep working (not recommended, but necessary if you want to finish something) and then start the break.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Rukenshia/pomodoro/blob/main/docs/timer_running.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/Rukenshia/pomodoro/raw/main/docs/timer_running.jpg" alt="timer running"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">During the pause, you can view some statistics. Every few iterations (4 by default), your pause will be longer to give you some time to recover.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview</h2><a id="user-content-overview" aria-label="Permalink: Overview" href="#overview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This project provides a toolchain for Postgres development, built on Postgres' own parser <code>libpg_query</code> to ensure 100% syntax compatibility. It is built on a Server-Client architecture with a transport-agnostic design. This means all features can be accessed not only through the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" rel="nofollow">Language Server Protocol</a>, but also through other interfaces like a CLI, HTTP APIs, or a WebAssembly module. The goal is to make all the great Postgres tooling out there as accessible as possible, and to build anything that is missing ourselves.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following features are implemented:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Autocompletion</li>
<li>Syntax Error Highlighting</li>
<li>Type-checking (via <code>EXPLAIN</code> error insights)</li>
<li>Linter, inspired by <a href="https://squawkhq.com/" rel="nofollow">Squawk</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Our current focus is on refining and enhancing these core features while building a robust and easily accessible infrastructure. For future plans and opportunities to contribute, please check out the issues and discussions. Any contributions are welcome!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>A colleague and I would like to write an academic paper on the potential impact of US funding cuts to global health programmes. Our ideal co-author is an international expert newly based in the US, and they would like to do it. But we are all worried that doing so will expose them to the risk of having their academic visa cancelled, being detained and eventually deported - no matter how solid the science and how academic and dry our language. We are especially fearful because they are brown. </p><p>My colleagues who have been writing about the new administration, or the situation in Gaza, in academic journals, on substack or on social media are cancelling work trips to the US. I too would not feel safe to go now, given how openly I have criticised the administration. Even a 1% chance of being denied entry or shipped to a detention centre is too high. </p><p>When I said these words out loud to my husband today I had to stop for a moment to let it sink in. Foreign scientists in the US are scared to publish anything perceived as critical for fear of being bundled off the street to a detention centre. Foreign scientists abroad are scared to go to the US because they have voiced criticism of the state. The US is actively cracking down on perceived dissenters and foreigners are the most vulnerable to arbitrary detention and lack of due legal process. The vaunted first amendment guaranteeing free speech has become a bitter and twisted joke. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png" width="1456" height="899" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:899,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:4506318,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://christinapagel.substack.com/i/160080456?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eff6593-7fbf-427a-aedb-9d3b8dd64313_5348x3301.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>I </span><a href="https://christinapagel.substack.com/p/censor-purge-defund-how-trump-following" rel="">already wrote three weeks ago</a><span> about how the Trump administration’s attacks on science were following the authoritarian playbook - and things have only got worse since. I am sure your first reaction is to think that I am overreacting. It sounds ridiculous to say such things. It sounds unbelievable even to me. But it is where we are and the sooner we accept it, the sooner we can organise to change it.

Researchers with US grant funding in the UK, EU, Canada and Australia</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00850-5" rel=""> are receiving surveys</a><span> asking whether their research complies with US government idology - specifically whether they are working in a DEI or climate change related area. </span></p><p>If you are a foreign scientist working in the US, or even seeking to enter the US for a conference or temporary collaboration, it is simply dangerous to have criticised, or to now criticise, the regime. </p><p><span>Scientists who are US citizens have more protections and many are now coming together to fight back - especially in the absence of any meanginful action by their institutions. </span><a href="https://www.aaup.org/" rel="">The American Association of University Professors</a><span> this week </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/academic-groups-sue-trump-administration-arresting-students-faculty-li-rcna198139" rel="">sued the Trump administration</a><span> for unconstitutional detention of foreign students and academics.

<pre>  Hi,
  
   starting a [VOTE] to get approval allowing me to begin the development of OpenWrt "Two".
  
  "Two" will have all of the features that "One" has with the following upgrades.
  
  * MT7988
  * 10G SFP
  * 5G copper
  * 4 port 2.5G copper
  * 1-2 port 1G copper
  * Tri-band Wi-Fi 7
  
  "Two" will be produced by GL.iNet and we are exploring options for US/EU based distribution.
  
  "Two" will (hopefully) be in the 250$ region with yet again a portion of that being donated to the project.
  
   expected availability is late '25.
  
          John</pre>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A concert on Monday night at New York’s Radio City Music Hall was a special occasion for Frank Miller: his parents’ wedding anniversary. He didn’t end up seeing the show — and before he could even get past security, he was informed that he was in fact banned for life from the venue and all other properties owned by Madison Square Garden (MSG).</p><p>After scanning his ticket and promptly being pulled aside by security, Miller was told by staff that he was barred from the MSG properties for an incident at the Garden in 2021. But Miller says he hasn’t been to the venue in nearly two decades.</p><p>“They hand me a piece of paper letting me know that I’ve been added to a ban list,” Miller says. “There’s a trespass notice if I ever show up on any MSG property ever again,” which includes venues like Radio City, the Beacon Theatre, the Sphere, and the Chicago Theatre.</p><p>He was baffled at first. Then it dawned on him: this was probably about a T-shirt he designed years ago. MSG Entertainment won’t say what happened with Miller or how he was picked out of the crowd, but he suspects he was identified via controversial facial recognition systems that the company deploys at its venues.</p><p>In 2017, 1990s New York Knicks star Charles Oakley was forcibly removed from his seat near Knicks owner and Madison Square Garden CEO James Dolan. The high-profile incident later spiraled into <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/40121460/oakley-stands-firm-nixing-invite-msg-gets-dolan-apology">an ongoing legal battle</a>. For Miller, Oakley was an “integral” part of the ’90s Knicks, he says. With his background in graphic design, he made <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CMyU_jxrA4c/">a shirt in the style of the old team logo</a> that read, “Ban Dolan” — a reference to the infamous scuffle.</p><p>A few years later, in 2021, a friend of Miller’s wore a Ban Dolan shirt to a Knicks game and was kicked out and banned from future events. That incident spawned <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qgJdgcFAyQ">ESPN segments</a> and <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/03/24/knicks-fan-kicked-out-of-madison-square-garden-over-ban-dolan-shirt/">news articles</a> and validated what many fans saw as a pettiness on Dolan and MSG’s part for going after individual fans who criticized team ownership.</p><p>But this week, Miller wasn’t wearing a Ban Dolan shirt; he wasn’t even at a Knicks game. His friend who was kicked out for the shirt tagged him in social media posts as the designer when it happened, but Miller, who lives in Seattle, hadn’t attended an event in New York in years.</p><div><p><a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,3.125,100,93.75" data-pswp-height="1912.5" data-pswp-width="1530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="A photo of a sign about facial recognition at Madison Square Garden." data-chromatic="ignore" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 700px" srcset="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=2400 2400w" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/IMG_1074.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C3.125%2C100%2C93.75&amp;w=2400"></a></p></div><p>Miller says that after he scanned his digital ticket, but before he went through security, a person working at Radio City stopped the line, pulled him aside, and asked him for his ID to verify who he was. They then walked him to another entrance of the building, where five or more staff members stood with him as he was told he was not allowed to return.</p><p>He’s not sure how exactly MSG connected him to the shirt or a 2021 incident during an event he wasn’t at. Miller told <em>The Verge </em>that until the concert, he had never actually purchased tickets to MSG events — they were either gifts from other people, or he got them through work.</p><p>“I’ve been reading articles about this facial recognition stuff that Dolan [and] MSG properties use, but I hadn’t been in or around the Garden outside of Penn Station to take New Jersey Transit [to] Newark Airport in almost 20 years now,” Miller says. A friend who was present made sure his parents enjoyed the show while Miller hung out at a bar nearby. He did not get a refund for his ticket, he says.</p><p>“I just found it comical, until I was told that my mom was crying [in the lobby],” Miller says of the experience. “I was like, ‘Oh man, I ruined their anniversary with my shit talk on the internet. Memes are powerful, and so is the surveillance state.” Miller and his parents also had tickets to a Knicks game the following night; his parents went without him, with a family friend in his place. Miller dropped his parents off from across the street.</p><p>MSG Entertainment did not respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s questions about whether facial recognition was used to identify Miller.</p><p>“Frank Miller Jr. made threats against an MSG executive on social media and produced and sold merchandise that was offensive in nature,” Mikyl Cordova, executive vice president of communications and marketing for the company, said in an emailed statement. “His behavior was disrespectful and disruptive and in violation of our code of conduct.”</p><p>Keeping close watch on patrons is nothing new for MSG. In 2022, a New Jersey attorney was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/21/23520990/rockettes-msg-facial-recognition-ban-privacy-ai">denied entry to Radio City Music Hall</a> during a Girl Scout troop trip. Her infraction <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/22/nyregion/madison-square-garden-facial-recognition.html">was being on an “attorney exclusion list”</a> full of people who work at firms that are suing MSG. The attorney was identified using facial recognition technology at the venue.</p><p>Miller says he was told at Radio City that he could appeal the ban if he wanted to but said it’s not a priority for him. He hopes his experience can help others who find themselves in a similar situation, where they’re unexpectedly denied entry at an expensive event based on data about them that has been collected by the company.</p><p>“It’s something that we all have to be aware of — the panopticon,” Miller says. “We’re [being] surveilled at all times, and it’s always framed as a safety thing, when rarely is that the case. It’s more of a deterrent and a fear tactic to try to keep people in line.”</p><p><em><strong>Update March 28th:</strong></em> <em>Added comment from MSG Entertainment spokesperson Mikyl Cordova. Clarified to reflect that Frank Miller said he had not been to an event at MSG venues in nearly 20 years.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

      <div id="content" tabindex="-1">

              
<p>One of the things I enjoy at Puget Systems is that transparency is one of our core principles. We choose to pull back the curtain and show what happens behind the scenes in the computer industry. Recently, tariffs have been a big deal, impacting numerous industries—including ours. I’ve seen a lot of misinformation and misunderstandings out there. I’ve seen vendors take advantage of the FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) to raise prices and generate urgency for sales. This post explains the current tariff situation as we see it, its immediate impact on the pricing of our computers, and our strategic approach. This is also a fast-moving situation, so there are details that might already be out of date by the time I publish this post!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-exactly-are-tariffs">What Exactly Are Tariffs?</h2>



<p>Let’s start there because I see misunderstandings about what a tariff is! A <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/tariffs/">tariff is defined</a> as a tax imposed by a government on imported goods. The <strong>buyer</strong> of those goods pays this tax, and because that increases the cost of the ingredients to build a product, it frequently results in a price increase of the end product to the <strong>consumer</strong>.</p>



<p>As of today, I’m talking about a <strong>20% total additional tariff</strong>, composed of two 10% tariffs that went into effect on Feb 4 and Mar 4. Those increases are just now working their way through costs in the computer industry.</p>



<p>Additionally, some items were exempted from a separate 25% tariff imposed in 2018-2019.&nbsp; As of now, those exemptions are set to expire in June, which would mean the total tariff to import those goods would have increased costs 45% just this year. Those potential increases in June are concerning, but are still too far in the future to have much helpful discussion about today.</p>



<h2 id="h-direct-and-indirect-impacts">Direct and Indirect Impacts</h2>



<p>When I think about tariff effects on the computer industry, three different types of impact come to mind:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Directly Impacted Goods:</strong> These products are explicitly subjected to tariffs, which directly increase their import costs and, therefore, their prices.</li>



<li><strong>Indirectly Impacted Goods:</strong> These products aren’t taxed directly but contain components in their bill of materials (BOM) that are subject to tariffs. For example, memory modules typically use DRAM and controller chips manufactured in countries like Korea or the US, which aren’t subject to these tariffs. However, the PCB and other minor components often originate from China, causing indirect price increases. Consequently, the overall prices of these indirectly impacted goods rise, though typically to a lesser extent than directly taxed items. Another form of indirect impact is the additional overhead cost and time involved in manufacturers moving production away from China, which increases cost in the short term and can also create supply shortages during the transition.</li>



<li><strong>Market and Inflationary Impacts:</strong> Tariffs also create broader economic effects—supply and demand shifts, market uncertainty, general overhead increases, and inflationary pressures—that drive overall costs higher, affecting even goods not directly or indirectly taxed.</li>
</ol>



<p>The added cost to the consumer often doesn’t even stop there, unfortunately. It is not uncommon for companies to use tariffs as a reason to justify price increases beyond the true impact on their costs. To SOME extent, this is understandable because the situation introduces a LOT of uncertainty, and companies need to add some buffer as risk protection. But all too often, I see communication and price increases that I know are exaggerated. I’m not only talking about the computer hardware industry—this can happen anywhere in the supply chain, which still impacts the cost of the computer.</p>



<p>Tariff impacts can be particularly complicated for us due to how many layers there are in the computer supply chain. While some manufacturers absorb costs initially, others may preload anticipated price hikes. Inventory levels influence these choices. If a company has a healthy stock of an item when the tariff goes live, they are not as immediately or sharply impacted. All of these things work together to make the situation murky and difficult to predict.</p>



<h2 id="h-our-strategy-at-puget-systems">Our Strategy at Puget Systems</h2>



<p>To address these challenges, our strategy at Puget Systems includes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>We use our inventory strategically to minimize immediate cost increases.</strong> We already have had to carry a ridiculously high amount of inventory to smooth out supply shortages, and this works in our favor… even if that is only to buy us some time for the dust to settle and for our cost impacts to be better understood. We run our company debt-free, and we use our purchasing power and cash reserves to carry even more inventory during volatile times.</li>



<li><strong>We maintain close relationships with our suppliers and ODM partners. </strong>It is always best when we can simply ask about their plans and strategies so we can work together! I’m proud to say this happens with almost all our ODM and distribution partners. The only limiters here are how quickly everything is moving and how many hours in the day we have for those conversations!</li>



<li><strong>We prioritize our attention on high-impact items.</strong> Particularly GPUs, where tariffs most significantly affect the consumer because of their high value.</li>



<li><strong>We absorb initial cost changes on many components. </strong>We adjust our pricing when ongoing long-term costs are clear, and absorb differences otherwise. This reduces noise and prevents us from making many nickel-and-dime changes.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-special-challenges-during-product-launches">Special Challenges During Product Launches</h2>



<p>These tariff situations become especially challenging during major product launches, such as NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX™ 5090. When a new product is released and in high demand, supply is typically constrained, causing prices to inflate significantly. The 5090 definitely falls into that camp! I can’t remember a product in recent history that has been in such short supply for so long after launch, and the future doesn’t look much better. This scenario makes it particularly difficult to determine precisely how much of the inflated price is due to simple supply-and-demand dynamics versus the additional burden of tariffs. Unpacking exactly what’s driving costs up becomes a complicated, often unclear process during these initial launch periods.</p>



<h2 id="h-component-specific-overview">Component-Specific Overview</h2>



<p>Alright, let’s get to the meat of the post! Here is what <strong>we </strong>are seeing in our component supply as of today. These changes will affect our computer prices starting on April 1.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Motherboards:</strong> We will absorb price changes to start. Motherboards and their sub-components come from various countries, and it is unclear where the ODMs will choose to adjust their pricing to mitigate (even if partially) the tariff. We’ll make changes over the coming months in specific instances if our costs change greatly.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>CPUs:</strong> There has been no substantial impact because there is no significant supply from China. This is the best news in this post! These are typically high-cost items, so if they had gotten a cost increase, it would have had a large impact on our prices.</li>



<li><strong>SSD and Hard Drives:</strong> Approximately 10% price increase. This is more due to supply ecosystem changes in those categories, not tariffs on the high-cost BOM items (chips or platters) themselves.</li>



<li><strong>Memory:</strong> Similar to SSDs, we’re anticipating a price increase in the 10% range, but at the same time, the market price of memory has been on a downward trend. We saw price decreases come in right before tariffs, so the combined effect will be that many items will not see much net change in cost.</li>



<li><strong>GPU &amp; Accelerators:</strong> 10% price increase. This is the worst news in this post because these components have a high cost to begin with, so even a smaller percent increase means a bigger dollar increase! They are actually impacted by a 20% tariff, but we believe the market has already built in some cost increase in anticipation of tariff changes. We’ll reassess after 2-4 weeks. Further, the tariffs here have the potential to increase from 20% to 45% on June 1, but we hope that US policy changes between now and then will dampen that increase. Brace yourself for that potential!</li>



<li><strong>Network and Storage Controllers:</strong> 20% price increase. Ouch.</li>



<li><strong>Chassis and Power Supplies:</strong> 20% price increase. Large-scale chassis production almost always comes from China, so our costs are directly impacted. We may see some price decreases from our suppliers in the future to help dampen the impact, and if so, we’ll pass that along with a price reduction at that time.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>CPU Coolers and Fans:</strong> Approximately 20% price increase. This is not universal but is what we believe will happen on average. Thankfully these are not very expensive items in the grand scheme of things, so it won’t have a large impact on system prices, but every dollar hurts!</li>
</ul>



<p>Any costs originating from Puget Systems ourselves (warranty, services, etc.) are receiving no change, so that also helps dampen our price change on the full computer. The only time we change those items is when our costs of running the business change—which is typically tied more to inflation and our #1 resource here—our people!</p>



<h2 id="h-future-changes">Future Changes</h2>



<p>As you can see, this is a lot of change. Today, we maintain a database of over 600 unique parts to build our computers. Shout out to our supply chain and website teams for the countless hours that have gone into this so far, with just as much effort needed for the foreseeable future! We will reassess this round of changes in a few weeks and make further honing adjustments anywhere we find our understanding to be inaccurate.</p>



<p>As it stands now, the next round of tariff changes are expected to take effect on June 1, when many categories of products could increase from 20% to 45%. This one really concerns me! But a lot can change between now and then, so we’ll take things as they come.</p>



<h2 id="h-working-together">Working Together</h2>



<p>We’re doing all we can to mitigate the effect of these immediate tariffs, as well as the possible increases on June 1. There are practical ways we can work together with you, our customers:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Forecasting:</strong> When we work together to forecast your needs, we can secure inventory and plan ahead on other supply chain impacts. We don’t need a commitment to stock up on our inventory—any information helps us make decisions!</li>



<li><strong>Early Purchasing: </strong>Consider making planned purchases before June 1 to avoid higher costs due to tariff increases. I don’t like giving a “buy now” message, but it is legitimate that the anticipated changes on June 1 are unclear and potentially large.</li>



<li><strong>Budget Planning: </strong>Include potential tariff impacts in your proposals and budgets now, so there are no surprises if prices increase before your purchases happen later in the year.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you can think of other ways we can work together on this, feel free to post in the comments section below. I’ll keep the transparency coming!</p>

Google has a <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/" rel="nofollow">history</a> of axing services and products, sometimes with little or no notice. Additionally, some people have privacy concerns about running their data through anything associated with the big G.</p>
<p dir="auto">So is it possible to create an independant, open source TURN server that you completely control at minimal expense? Yes it is, with the possible irony that here we are relying on the free tier of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Plenty of people have been burnt by Oracle in the past as they too have a history of axing services. If you're going this route, it's a good idea to keep backups elsewhere.</p>
<p dir="auto">Anyway. Here's what I did:</p>

<p dir="auto">You will need this later because you will need SSL. This is the only thing on this list that will cost money. There are so many providers around and so many options that we're not going to go into details here. Basically, just find a name you like and pay the money to get it registered.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">2. Sign up for the Oracle Free Tier</h3><a id="user-content-2-sign-up-for-the-oracle-free-tier" aria-label="Permalink: 2. Sign up for the Oracle Free Tier" href="#2-sign-up-for-the-oracle-free-tier"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can do this <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You will need to enter credit card information, but if you never sign up for additional services or click on the "upgrade account" button you will stay on the free tier forever*. The free tier is more than enough compute resources for what we are doing here.</p>
<p dir="auto">* Or that's what they're saying for now, anyway...</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">3. Create a new subnet</h3><a id="user-content-3-create-a-new-subnet" aria-label="Permalink: 3. Create a new subnet" href="#3-create-a-new-subnet"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Once you have your Oracle acount set up the first thing you want to do is create a new subnet for your server to sit on. This is particularly important if you're going to create more VMs. Port security in OCI is handled via Security Lists which are then assigned to subnets. All machines sitting on the same subnet will have the same ports accessible (on the server side, more on this later) and this TURN server needs a range of fairly exotic ports opened up. If you're unfamiliar with subnetting, here is a very brief overview. The Virtual Cloud Network that you are assigned will probably have an IPV4 block that looks like this: 10.0.0.0/16, which means that there are 65,534 useable IP addresses. You want to carve out some of those IP addresses into a separate pool (a subnet), so when creating that subnet you need to specify that the first IPv4 CIDR Block will be 10.0.0.0/24 (giving you 254 useable IPs). A second subnet could be 10.0.1.0/24 (giving you a second "pool" of 254 useable IPs).</p>
<p dir="auto">From the main menu, click on the "hamburger" menu at top left, then Networking, then Virtual cloud networks:
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/lvidgen/WebRTC/blob/master/FOSS_TURN_Server/images/vcn.png"><img src="https://github.com/lvidgen/WebRTC/raw/master/FOSS_TURN_Server/images/vcn.png" alt="alt text" title="Accessing the VCN"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You will see the default VCN (you can only have one in the free tier). Click on that, and then "Subnets" on the left-hand menu (if it's not already selected). You will see the default subnet listed, probably with an IPv4 CIDR Block of 10.0.0.0/24. If the /24 is any other number, click the 3 dots at the right to edit, then change the Mask to 24 and Save Changes. Back on the main screen, click Create New Subnet, give it a name (TURN Server Subnet will do), specify the IPv4 CIDR Block of 10.0.1.0/24 and then the Create Subnet button. Back on the main screen, click on "Security Lists" on the left hand menu</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">4. Create the Security List</h3><a id="user-content-4-create-the-security-list" aria-label="Permalink: 4. Create the Security List" href="#4-create-the-security-list"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The security list is like a firewall for your subnet - it dictates what kind of traffic is allowed to go to which ports. If something isn't explicitly allowed here, it will be denied. The machine that we are running will host 4 servers - <a href="https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server">PeerJS</a>, which puts a wrapper around the WebRTC Communication protocol, <a href="https://github.com/coturn/coturn">CoTurn</a> a relay server which facilitates peer to communication when hosts are behind a NAT, <a href="https://github.com/ezrarieben/coturn-credential-api">coturn-credential-api</a> a credentials server you can use with CoTurn's REST API to require authentication to the server and prevent abuse, and <a href="https://nginx.org/en/" rel="nofollow">nginx</a> a web server that we will use to serve web pages. Each of these needs to be reachable, so needs ports open. We will also be opening a couple of ports for connectivity testing.</p>
<p dir="auto">Click the Create Security List button, then "add another ingress rule" and enter the following (note that once you've entered information for one rule there is an "Add another ingress rule" button at the bottom:</p>

<p dir="auto">Once you have entered all the rules, Click on the "Create Security List" button at the bottom. Back on the main screen, click on "Subnets" on the left menu, then on the name of the subnet you just created, then on the "Add Security list" button, select the list you just created from the menu and click the "Add Security List" button at the bottom.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">5. Save a configuration</h3><a id="user-content-5-save-a-configuration" aria-label="Permalink: 5. Save a configuration" href="#5-save-a-configuration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">So now it's finally time to actually make the server! The temptation now would be to jump in and create an Instance (what Oracle calls a Virtual Machine) but sometimes when you try this, Oracle is temporarily out of space and the process fails, meaning that you have to start all over again from scratch. So with a couple of extra clicks we can save the configuration and try again any time we like at the click of a button.</p>
<p dir="auto">From the hamburger menu at the top left, select Compute" then "Instance Configurations" and click the "Create Instance configuration" button. A couple of things to note here before you move on: At the time of writing, you basically have the equivalent of 4 OCPUs and 24 GB of memory to play with. This is across your entire account, and how you use them is up to you. You could make one machine with 4 OCPUs and 24 GB of memory or you could make 4 machines with 1 OCPU and 6 GB of memory of memory each. You can edit these amounts later, but it's worth keeping in mind at this point. Give the configuration a name and move to the section below.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Selecting an image</h4><a id="user-content-selecting-an-image" aria-label="Permalink: Selecting an image" href="#selecting-an-image"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In the "Image and shape" section, click the link to edit. Click the "change image" button, select "Ubuntu" and check the box next to the latest Canonical Ubuntu version you can see (build numbers are available by clicking the down arrow at right, but whatever is at the top of the list should be fine) and then on the "Select image" button at the bottom.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Selecting a shape</h4><a id="user-content-selecting-a-shape" aria-label="Permalink: Selecting a shape" href="#selecting-a-shape"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Back on the main screen, click the "Change shape" button. Select "Ampere (Arm-based processor)" and check the box next to the shape that appears on the list (VM.Standard.A1.Flex at the time of writing). A section below appears where you can configure the amount of CPU and memory your server will use. This one is completely up to you, but 1 OCPU and 9GB of memory works fine. If you are not planning on crfeating any other VMs in your free tier you might as well max it out with 4 OCPUs and 24 GB of memory. Once you're done, click "Select shape".</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Nominating the subnet</h4><a id="user-content-nominating-the-subnet" aria-label="Permalink: Nominating the subnet" href="#nominating-the-subnet"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In the Primary VNIC information section, leave everything as default but at the bottom make sure that the subnet that is shown is the one you just created - "TURN Server Subnet" was the example name given above - and not the default one. <em><strong>This step is very important.</strong></em> If the machine is created on the wrong subnet there's nothing you can do but delete it and start again.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Adding SSH keys</h4><a id="user-content-adding-ssh-keys" aria-label="Permalink: Adding SSH keys" href="#adding-ssh-keys"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Leave the Primary VNIC IP addresses section as default and move to the "Add SSH keys" section. SSH is how you will interact with the remote server from your local computer. If you already have SSH keys that you would like to use to access this server, select upload public key files and do that. Otherwise select "Generate a key pair for me" and save the private key in a place you will remember and with a name that makes sense - we'll use turn_server.key for this example.</p>
<p dir="auto">Leave everything else as default and click the "Create" button at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Creating the server</h4><a id="user-content-creating-the-server" aria-label="Permalink: Creating the server" href="#creating-the-server"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Now click on the name of the configuration that you just created and click the "Launch instance" button. This will open up a similar screen to the Instance configuration one you were just on. You may notice a little window at the bottom with a cost summary telling telling you that the boot volume will cost a couple of bucks a month. This is due to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oraclecloud/comments/14pg5dr/oracle_always_free_service_have_boot_volume_cost/" rel="nofollow">bug in the cost analyser tool</a> you can ignore this - you won't be charged for the above configuration.</p>
<p dir="auto">Click the "Create" button. With any luck you will be taken to another screen that will say "Provisioning" for a minute or so and then "Running". If you stay on the same screen and get an Out of Capacity error, try clicking the Create button again. If you get the same error, leave it for half an hour and try again. Out of capacity errors used to be very common, but it seems that Oracle has freed up more space and you can usually get an Instance running on the first try. If you are experiencing long delays, you could consider <a href="https://github.com/mohankumarpaluru/oracle-freetier-instance-creation">automating the process with Python</a> or if you're looking for something simpler, an auto-clicker might do the trick, provided you are on the page with the Create button showing - just paste this into your console and hit Enter:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="setInterval(function(){document.querySelectorAll(&quot;.oui-button.oui-button-primary&quot;)[1].click()},60000)"><pre><code>setInterval(function(){document.querySelectorAll(".oui-button.oui-button-primary")[1].click()},60000)
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Testing the server</h4><a id="user-content-testing-the-server" aria-label="Permalink: Testing the server" href="#testing-the-server"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Whichever way you created it, you should now be looking at the running server screen. Copy the Public IP address from the right side of the screen, open up a command prompt and try pinging your server:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/lvidgen/WebRTC/blob/master/FOSS_TURN_Server/images/ping.png"><img src="https://github.com/lvidgen/WebRTC/raw/master/FOSS_TURN_Server/images/ping.png" alt="alt text" title="Pinging the server"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Yay. We have connectivity. Let's SSH into the server and start setting it up.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">6. Access the server via SSH</h3><a id="user-content-6-access-the-server-via-ssh" aria-label="Permalink: 6. Access the server via SSH" href="#6-access-the-server-via-ssh"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In the command prompt, navigate to the folder where you saved your private SSH key file, then enter the following command, replacing the name of the key file that you saved and the IP address:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="ssh -i your_private_key_name.key ubuntu@your_public_ip_address"><pre><code>ssh -i your_private_key_name.key ubuntu@your_public_ip_address
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The first time you attempt access you will be asked to confirm:
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/lvidgen/WebRTC/blob/master/FOSS_TURN_Server/images/ssh.png"><img src="https://github.com/lvidgen/WebRTC/raw/master/FOSS_TURN_Server/images/ssh.png" alt="alt text" title="SSH confirmation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Type "yes". If everything has gone how it should you should now be looking at a linux command prompt with the username ubuntu. Most likely there will be a message saying that the update list is old. This is because Oracle posted the VM image that you used a while ago. It's best practice to keep your system updated anyway, so run the following and wait a while while it exectutes:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade"><pre><code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">7. Fire up a web server</h3><a id="user-content-7-fire-up-a-web-server" aria-label="Permalink: 7. Fire up a web server" href="#7-fire-up-a-web-server"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configure DNS</h4><a id="user-content-configure-dns" aria-label="Permalink: Configure DNS" href="#configure-dns"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Now that you've got an IP address, you can set up DNS to point your domain name at it. This may seem premature, but DNS changes take a while to propagate through the network, so we might as well do it now and we can work on other things while that takes effect. Just log into the account where you bought your domain name, find the section where you can edit (or create) A records and make sure you have an A record with your domain name as the host name (without the http..., so example.com for example) and your public IP address as the value. For ease at this point, add another A record with your domain name plus the www (so <a href="http://www.example.com/" rel="nofollow">www.example.com</a>) and your public IP address as the value. As a quick check to see if the changes have porpagated you can ping your domain name - if the results come back showing your public IP address you're in business. Sometimes it's instant, sometimes it takes a while. If it takes any longer than a few hours it's probably worth contacting your domain hosting company to see if there's a problem.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Install nginx</h4><a id="user-content-install-nginx" aria-label="Permalink: Install nginx" href="#install-nginx"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We'll be using a web server for a couple of things and while there are a few options, <a href="https://nginx.org/en/" rel="nofollow">nginx</a> suits all our needs. To install it, just run:</p>

<p dir="auto">Once it's done, check the status:</p>

<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/lvidgen/WebRTC/blob/master/FOSS_TURN_Server/images/nginx.png"><img src="https://github.com/lvidgen/WebRTC/raw/master/FOSS_TURN_Server/images/nginx.png" alt="alt text" title="nginx status"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Open up some ports</h4><a id="user-content-open-up-some-ports" aria-label="Permalink: Open up some ports" href="#open-up-some-ports"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You might be tempted now to try to access the webserver by pointing your browser at your IP address. Not so fast! Much like your security list, the ports on your server are configured to deny all traffic unless it is allowed. You can list the open ports by issuing the following command:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo iptables -t filter -nv -L INPUT --line-numbers"><pre><code>sudo iptables -t filter -nv -L INPUT --line-numbers
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">A lot of tutorials on the web will tell you that this is what you want to do:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT"><pre><code>sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Run it, then run but the previous command to list the open ports. You see that the problem is that the -A flag appends the rule to the end of the list, after the REJECT all rule. So a packet will never reach this rule. What we want is to insert rules before that reject statement, the easiest way being to use the -I flag instead, followed by the line number where you want to insert the rule (here we are using 2, so these rules will end up on lines 2 and 3 of the INPUT and OUTPUT chains). Below are the four rules that nginx needs:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo iptables -I INPUT 2 -p tcp --dport 80 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 2 -p tcp --sport 80 -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I INPUT 2 -p tcp --dport 443 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 2 -p tcp --sport 443 -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT"><pre><code>sudo iptables -I INPUT 2 -p tcp --dport 80 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 2 -p tcp --sport 80 -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I INPUT 2 -p tcp --dport 443 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 2 -p tcp --sport 443 -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">One additional advantage of using the --line-numbers flag when listing rules is that you can delete rules by line number. If we wanted to delete rule 20 on the INPUT chain we could just do:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo iptables -D INPUT 20"><pre><code>sudo iptables -D INPUT 20
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">One more thing we want to do with iptables: by default, these rules are not persistent, so if you ever restart your server you will have to set them all up again. You need to save changes to your iptables file by calling this command:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo sh -c 'iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4'"><pre><code>sudo sh -c 'iptables-save &gt; /etc/iptables/rules.v4'
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Now you're ready to check your web server - if you can successfully ping your domain name you should be able to browse to it. Navigate to http://your_domain_name. You'll probably see a scary looking message about how the site is insecure. We'll fix that soon. Just click on "Proceed anyway" (or something like that, depending on the browser). If you can see the "Welcome to nginx" page, you're ready to move on :)</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Install a TLS certficate</h4><a id="user-content-install-a-tls-certficate" aria-label="Permalink: Install a TLS certficate" href="#install-a-tls-certficate"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To get rid of that scary warning message we need to install a TLS certificate so that our plain ol http site will use the more secure https protocol. Thankfully the folks at the <a href="https://eff.org/" rel="nofollow">EFF</a> have made this a very simple process.<br>
You can read detailed instructions <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&amp;os=snap" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but basically:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>sudo snap install --classic certbot</code> installs the Certbot tool</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot</code> ensures that Certbot can be run</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>sudo certbot --nginx</code> gets a certificate, asks you a few configuration questions and turns on https</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>sudo certbot renew --dry-run</code> (optional) tests the automated renewal procedure - with this running you should always have a valid certificate</p>
<p dir="auto">If everything worked OK you should now be able to refresh your browser page and you will see that your site is being served with the https protocol</p>

<p dir="auto">It's time to start uploading some files to our web server, but before we do that we want to take over ownership of the directory that nginx uses to serve webpages. If we don't, we'll have to add "sudo" to the start of every command which is annoying. The default location for web files is in /var/www/html, so to check ownership we can run</p>

<p dir="auto">We see that root is the owner. To change that we change the owner of the directory and everything inside it to be the currently logged in user:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo chown -R $USER /var/www/html"><pre><code>sudo chown -R $USER /var/www/html

You can try it out by opening it in a browser and opening another copy in a different tab. In a real app you would have more error handling - the big one to watch for here is to make sure that the two connections use different IDs.</p>
<p dir="auto">To upload the file to the folder that you just made, open up a regular command prompt (not the one you're using to SSH into the server), navigate to the directory where you have the index.html and private key files and issue the following command:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="scp -i your_private_key_name.key index.html ubuntu@your_public_IP:/var/www/html/peertest"><pre><code>scp -i your_private_key_name.key index.html ubuntu@your_public_IP:/var/www/html/peertest

<p dir="auto">As mentioned before, using PeerJS the way we do above means that it connects to the PeerJS server, which itself uses Google's TURN server when required. To get more control over the stack we need to create our own PeerJS server. You can see the project page <a href="https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server">here</a>, but basically:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Install npm and the PeerJS Server</h4><a id="user-content-install-npm-and-the-peerjs-server" aria-label="Permalink: Install npm and the PeerJS Server" href="#install-npm-and-the-peerjs-server"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The PeerJS server is available through the Node Package Manager, which itself relies on node.js so we have some installing to do, But first we have a problem. We can run <code>sudo apt-cache policy nodejs</code> to see what version of nodejs we are going to get if we install it from the repository, and what the output tells us is that we're going to get:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Candidate: 10.19.0~dfsg-3ubuntu1.6</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">But when we look at PeerJS in npm, it says that we need 14 or above:
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/lvidgen/WebRTC/blob/master/FOSS_TURN_Server/images/peerjs.png"><img src="https://github.com/lvidgen/WebRTC/raw/master/FOSS_TURN_Server/images/peerjs.png" alt="alt text" title="Peer JS specs in the npm library"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">So we need to install another way, directly from the source. Version 20 is the latest at time of writing, so let's go for that...:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs"><pre><code>curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The nice thing about installing from nodesource is that npm is already installed, so now we can install peer right away...</p>

<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Test the PeerJS Server</h4><a id="user-content-test-the-peerjs-server" aria-label="Permalink: Test the PeerJS Server" href="#test-the-peerjs-server"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Fire up the server with the following command:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="peerjs --port 9000 --key peerjs --path /myapp"><pre><code>peerjs --port 9000 --key peerjs --path /myapp
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">then point your browser at <code>http://your_domain_name:9000/myapp</code> - if everything is working you will get a small JSON response with details about PeerJS name, description and website.</p>
<p dir="auto">So it's working, but there are a couple of problems:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The server is running as a foreground process. Getting a command prompt back in the terminal or closing the terminal window will mean killing the server</li>
<li>We're using the unsecure http protocol</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Hit Ctrl + C to stop the PeerJS server, then type the following command to open a screen session. Screen is a program that allows us to push processes to the background where they keep running regardless of what we do with the main terminal window. We're going to give our session a name so it's easier to reference later. You do this with the -S flag:</p>

<p dir="auto">A regular, empty command prompt should have opened up. Now we can start the server, but supply it with the ssl certificates that we got from certibot previously, ensuring a secure connection:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo peerjs --port 9000 --key peerjs --path /myapp --sslkey /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain_name_here/privkey.pem --sslcert /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain_name_here/fullchain.pem"><pre><code>sudo peerjs --port 9000 --key peerjs --path /myapp --sslkey /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain_name_here/privkey.pem --sslcert /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain_name_here/fullchain.pem
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The server should start. Hit Ctrl + a and then d to detach from the screen, which should get you back to the main terminal window. Now you can test <code>https://your_domain_name:9000/myapp</code> - it should return the same response that you got when browsing to the http version.</p>

<p dir="auto">and look for this line: <code>peer = new Peer(getById("myid").value);</code>
We want to change that to:</p>

                  {host: &quot;your_domain_name&quot;,

<p dir="auto">We can test the connection using <a href="https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/trickle-ice/" rel="nofollow">Trickle ICE</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Let's start with the simplest test: enter <code>STUN:your_domain_name:3478</code> in the STUN or TURN URI box, click "Add server", scroll down and click "Gather cadidates". In the output there should be an srflx type response listed:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/lvidgen/WebRTC/blob/master/FOSS_TURN_Server/images/stuntest.png"><img src="https://github.com/lvidgen/WebRTC/raw/master/FOSS_TURN_Server/images/stuntest.png" alt="alt text" title="STUN test"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Let's test the TURN server: enter <code>TURN:your_domain_name:3478</code> in the STUN or TURN URI box, turnuser in the username box and turn456 in the password box (these were defined in your config file) and click "Add server", scroll down and click "Gather cadidates". In the output there will probably be an srflx type response listed again, along with a relay type:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/lvidgen/WebRTC/blob/master/FOSS_TURN_Server/images/turntest.png"><img src="https://github.com/lvidgen/WebRTC/raw/master/FOSS_TURN_Server/images/turntest.png" alt="alt text" title="TURN test"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Cool. So we can connect to port 3478, but we really want to connect to the TLS listenting port, 5349. Even a simple STUN test fails there. We need to include paths to our SSL files in the config file, but here's something annoying: the Let's Encrypt folder where they're currently kept is owned by root and coturn does not have access to it, not even when the root user starts it. There are two not great options here: one is to edit the <code>/lib/systemd/system/coturn.service</code> file and make the User and Group equal root so that coturn runs as root. If that seems a little nuclear, make a new folder, copy the files there and change the permissions so that turnserver can access them:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo mkdir /etc/turnservercerts
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain_here/fullchain.pem /etc/turnservercerts
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain_here/privkey.pem /etc/turnservercerts
sudo chown turnserver:turnserver /etc/turnservercerts -R
sudo chmod 600 /etc/turnservercerts -R"><pre><code>sudo mkdir /etc/turnservercerts
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain_here/fullchain.pem /etc/turnservercerts
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain_here/privkey.pem /etc/turnservercerts
sudo chown turnserver:turnserver /etc/turnservercerts -R
sudo chmod 600 /etc/turnservercerts -R
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Either way you go, you will then add these two lines to the config file (with paths to the original key files if you went for the first "run as root" option):</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pkey=/etc/turnservercerts/privkey.pem
cert=/etc/turnservercerts/fullchain.pem"><pre><code>pkey=/etc/turnservercerts/privkey.pem

<p dir="auto">Save the changes, then restart coturn:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo systemctl restart coturn"><pre><code>sudo systemctl restart coturn
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Now let's try with <code>TURN:your_domain_name:5349</code> in the STUN or TURN URI box, turnuser in the username box and turn456 in the password box:</p>

<p dir="auto">The coturn-credential-api is written in php. Some Linux distributions come with php installed, but the Oracle version of Ubuntu does not, so we're going to have to install it.

<p dir="auto">This app is designed with ad-hoc connections in mind, where a user chooses their own username and just connects without an account.

<p dir="auto">What we have in place now prevents abuse in that it doesn't expose login details for your TURN server that can be used for longer than 24 hours (this time limit can be set in the credentaials API <code>config.inc.php</code> file), so a super-naive "bad actor" would have to come back to the app once a day to get new credentials. A slightly more sophisticated bad actor could just include the "fetch" function in their own code and authenticate that way. A simple way to prevent that kind of abuse would be to edit the line in the <code>index.php</code> file of the credentials API to not accept cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), or restrict it to certain domains. The PeerJS server also has a CORS option that you can stipulate when starting the server.</p>

<h2>
There’s a psychological burden of digital life even heavier than distraction.
</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_a7eb7cf1ab024efcb17c380ef69c53f4/_image_cache/4fb32547-b9dc-4792-a37b-52de90caa249.svg" width="800" height="650">
</p>
<p>
When the iPhone was first introduced in 2007, the notion of an “everything device” was universally celebrated. A single object that could serve as phone, camera, music player, web browser, and so much more promised unprecedented convenience and connectivity. It was, quite literally, the dream of the nineties. But the better part of twenty years later, we’ve gained enough perspective to recognize that this revolutionary vision came with costs we did not anticipate.
</p>
<p>
Distraction, of course, is the one we can all relate to first. An everything device has the problem of being useful nearly all the time, and when in use, all consuming. When you use it to do one thing, it pushes you toward others. In order to avoid this, you must disable functions. That’s an interesting turn of events, isn’t it? We have made a thing that does more than we need, more often than we desire. Because system-wide, duplicative notifications are enabled by default, the best thing you could say about the device’s design is that it lacks a point of view toward a prioritization of what it does. The worst thing you could say is that it is distracting <em>by design</em>.
</p>
<p>
(I find it fascinating how many people –&nbsp;myself included — attempt to reduce the features of their smartphone to the point of replicating a “dumbphone” experience in order to save ourselves from distraction, but don’t actually go so far as to use a lesser-featured phone because a few <em>key</em> features are just too good to give up. A dumbphone is less distracting, but a nightmare for text messaging and a lousy camera. It turns out I don’t want a <em>phone</em> at all, but a camera that texts — and ideally one smaller than anything on the market now. I know I’m not alone, and yet this product will not be made. )
</p>
<p>
This kind of distraction is <em>direct</em> distraction. It’s the kind we are increasingly aware of, and as its accumulating stress puts pressure on our inner and outer lives, we can combat it with various choices and optimizations. But there is another kind of distraction that is less direct, though just as cumulative and, I believe, just as toxic. I’ve come to think of it as the “digital echo.”
</p>
<p>
On a smartphone, every single thing it is used to do generates information that goes elsewhere. The vast majority of this is unseen — though not unfelt — by us. Everyone knows that there is no privacy within a digital device, nor within its “listening” range. We are all aware that as much information as smartphone provides to us, exponentially more is generated for someone else — someone watching, listening, measuring, and monetizing. The “digital echo” is more than just the awareness of this; it is the cognitive burden of knowing that our actions generate data elsewhere. The echo exists whenever we use connected technology, creating a subtle but persistent awareness that what we do isn’t just our own. A device like a smartphone has always generated a “digital echo”, but many others are as well.
</p>
<p>
Comparing two different motor vehicles illustrates this well. In a car like a Tesla, which we might think of as a “smartcar” since it’s a computer you can drive, <em>every</em> function produces a digital signal. Adjusting the air conditioning, making a turn, opening a door — the car knows and records it all, transmitting this information to distant servers. By contrast, my 15-year-old Honda performs all of its functions without creating these digital echoes. The operations remain private, existing only in the moment they occur. In our increasingly digital world, I have begun to feel the SCIF-like isolation of the cabin of my car, and I like it.
</p>
<p>
(The “smartcar”, of course, won’t remain simply a computer you can drive. The pinnacle “smartcar” drives itself. The self-driving car represents perhaps the most acute expression of how digital culture values attention and convenience above all else, especially control and ownership. As a passenger of a self-driving car, you surrender control over the vehicle’s operation in exchange for the “freedom” to direct your attention elsewhere, most likely to some digital signal either on your own device or on screens within the vehicle. I can see the value in this; driving can be boring and most times I am behind the wheel I’d rather be doing something else. But currently, truly autonomous vehicles are service-enabling products like Waymo, meaning we also relinquish ownership. The benefits of that also seem obvious: no insurance premiums, no maintenance costs. But not every advantage is worth its cost. The economics of self-driving cars are not clear-cut. There’s a real debate to be had about
attention, convenience, and ownership that I hope will play out before we have no choice but to be a passenger in someone else’s machine.)
</p>
<p>
When I find myself looking for new ways to throttle my smartphone’s functions, or when I sit in the untapped isolation of my car, I often wonder about the costs of the “digital echo.” What is the psychological cost of knowing that your actions aren’t just your own, but create information that can be observed and analyzed by others? As more aspects of our lives generate digital echoes, they force an ambient awareness of being perpetually witnessed rather than simply existing.
</p>
<p>
This transforms even solitary activities into implicit social interactions. It forces us to maintain awareness of our “observed self” alongside our “experiencing self,” creating a kind of persistent self-consciousness. We become performers in our own lives rather than merely participants.
</p>
<p>
I think this growing awareness contributes to a growing interest in returning to single-focus devices and analog technologies. Record players and film cameras aren’t experiencing resurgence merely from nostalgia, but because they offer fundamentally different relationships with media — relationships characterized by intention, presence, and focus.
</p>
<p>
In my own life, this recognition has led to deliberate choices about which technologies to embrace and which to avoid. Here are three off the top of my head:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Replacing streaming services with owned media formats (CDs, Blu-rays) that remain accessible on my terms, not subject to platform changes or content disappearance
</li>
<li>
Preferring printed books while using dedicated e-readers for digital texts — in this case, accepting certain digital echoes when the benefits (in particular, access to otherwise unavailable material) outweigh the costs
</li>
<li>
Rejecting smart home devices entirely, recognizing that their convenience rarely justifies the added complexity and surveillance they introduce
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You’ve probably made similarly-motivated decisions, perhaps in other areas of your life or in relation to other things entirely. What matters, I think, is that these choices aren’t about rejecting technology but about creating spaces for more intentional engagement. They represent a search for balance in a world that increasingly defaults to maximum connectivity.
</p>
<p>
I had a conversation recently with a friend who mused, “What are these the early days of?” What a wonderful question that is; we are, I hope, always living in the early days of something. Perhaps now, we’re witnessing the beginning of a new phase in our relationship with technology. The initial wave of digital transformation prioritized connecting everything possible; the next wave may be more discriminating about what should be connected and what’s better left direct and immediate. I hope to see operating systems truly designed around focus rather than multitasking, interfaces that respect attention rather than constantly competing for it, and devices that serve discrete purposes exceptionally well instead of performing multiple functions adequately.
</p>
<p>
The digital echoes of our actions will likely continue to multiply, but we can choose which echoes we’re willing to generate and which activities deserve to remain ephemeral — to exist only in the moment they occur and then in the memories of those present. What looks like revision or retreat may be the next wave of innovation, borne out of having learned the lessons of the last few decades and desiring better for the next.

  <p>Today we’re delighted to introduce the first stable release of swiftly, a Swift version manager that takes the pain out of installing, managing and updating your Swift toolchain.</p>

<p>The latest version of Swift is bundled with Xcode for writing apps for Apple platforms. But perhaps you want to install Swift on a different platform like Linux, or use a different version of the toolchain for building services or command line tools. Downloading, extracting and installing a trusted build of Swift along with the relevant dependencies for your operating system can require quite a few manual and error-prone steps.</p>

<p>swiftly has been around for some years as a community-supported tool for Swift developers using Linux. With this release, we’re officially supporting it as part of the core Swift toolchain, including hosting it as part of the <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang">Swift GitHub organization</a>. We’ve also added macOS support to make it easier to install Swift separately from Xcode.</p>



<p>swiftly is the best tool to install the standalone toolchain, providing commands to install Swift on a new system, update to the latest stable version, and experiment or test with nightly snapshots or older versions. It also makes it easy to switch effortlessly between multiple installed toolchains. You can even add a file to your project repository so swiftly will use the same toolchain version for all members of your development team.</p>

<p>Naturally, swiftly itself is written in Swift, and is able to update itself to the latest version.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at some of the features of swiftly!</p>

<p>To get started, visit <a href="https://swift.org/install">swift.org/install</a> and install it.</p>

<p>swiftly will provide directions after installation if there are any system packages, or shell commands needed for smooth operation of the new toolchain.</p>

<p>The latest Swift toolchain is installed as the default, so you can immediately use it to start a new project. For example:</p>



<p>The <code>swiftly use</code> command selects the default toolchain for Swift commands (e.g. <code>swift test</code>, <code>swift build</code>):</p>

<div><pre><code>$ swiftly use 6.0.3
$ swift --version
--
Apple Swift version 6.0.3 (swiftlang-6.0.3.1.2 clang-1600.0.28.6)
Target: arm64-apple-macosx15.0
</code></pre></div>

<p>At a later point, if there’s a new release of Swift you can install it alongside the existing toolchain with the <code>latest</code> command:</p>



<p>Pre-release of versions of Swift are available, including nightly “snapshot” toolchains. They can be easily listed using swiftly:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ swiftly list-available main-snapshot
--
Available main development snapshot toolchains
----------------------------------------------
main-snapshot-2025-03-25
...
</code></pre></div>

<p>Once you’ve identified a snapshot toolchain, it can be installed using its name:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ swiftly install main-snapshot-2025-03-25
--
Installing main-snapshot-2025-03-25
</code></pre></div>

<p>Another way to temporarily use a specific version of Swift is to use the special ‘+’ selector. With this syntax, you don’t need to first switch to a different toolchain:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ swiftly run lldb +main-snapshot-2025-03-25
--
(lldb) _
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you’re building a SwiftPM project in a team setting and want to enforce a common version of the Swift toolchain on all contributors, simply create a <code>.swift-version</code> file in the root of your project folder with the desired version (e.g. “6.0.3”).</p>

<p>As swiftly is updated with new features and bug fixes, you can run <code>swiftly self-update</code> to check and install new releases.</p>



<p>By writing swiftly in Swift, we’re able to take advantage of the language’s features, support, and ecosystem of related projects. Swift comes with standard library features for working with the filesystem in its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/">Foundation</a> module. For network operations <a href="https://github.com/swift-server/async-http-client">Async HTTP Client</a> is there to work the HTTP requests. And to retrieve the latest Swift release, swiftly uses the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-generator">Swift OpenAPI</a> plugin to generate the code to interact with the <a href="http://swift.org/">swift.org</a>  website. Lastly, it takes advantage of Swift’s interoperability with C to use the existing libarchive library to work with archives. swiftly uses libarchive to extract the toolchains downloaded from the Swift website and the integration is simple.</p>

<p>It can be challenging to build shell programs that work well across multiple platforms with minimal system dependencies; this motivated us to switch swiftly away from using a shell program to install it and become a self-installing binary application. swiftly has access to excellent argument parsing capabilities, beautiful <code>--help</code> screens, and the full standard library.</p>

<p>The only remaining problem was being able to deliver the operating system and processor architecture specific binary to the users system with simplicity. The <a href="http://swift.org/">swift.org</a> website helps with operating system detection, but it cannot reliably detect the Linux distribution. Luckily, there is the <a href="https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/static-linux-getting-started.html">Swift Static Linux SDK</a> that makes binaries that work with a wide range of distributions. The processor architecture can be determined on most unixes using <code>uname -m</code> . The result of all of this is the simplicity of a copy and paste from the website to your terminal and get started with Swift.</p>



<p>Moving forward, swiftly will become the default way to install Swift outside of Xcode. The initial version supports macOS and a variety of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Amazon Linux.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://swift.org/swiftly/documentation/swiftlydocs/">swiftly documentation</a> provides further information about <a href="https://swift.org/swiftly/documentation/swiftly/automated-install">using swiftly in a CI/CD environment</a>, as well as setting proxy servers and custom install locations for enterprise environments. swiftly is an open source project, and so you can raise new issues or contribute pull requests at its <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swiftly">GitHub repository</a>. You can also <a href="https://forums.swift.org/tag/swiftly">ask questions or discuss swiftly on the Swift Forums</a>.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Patrick Freed for creating swiftly, contributing it to the Swift organization, and his continued contributions to this valuable tool. The community is what makes Swift amazing!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="articleContent"><h2>Back to Vegas, and This Time, We Brought Home the MVH Award !</h2>
<p>In 2024 we released the blog post <a href="https://www.landh.tech/blog/20240304-google-hack-50000">We Hacked Google A.I. for $50,000</a>, where we traveled in 2023 to Las Vegas with Joseph "rez0" Thacker, Justin "Rhynorater" Gardner, and myself, Roni "Lupin" Carta, on a hacking journey that spanned from Las Vegas, Tokyo to France, all in pursuit of Gemini vulnerabilities during Google's LLM bugSWAT event. Well, we did it again …</p>
<p>The world of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to be the Wild West of tech.  Since GPT burst onto the scene, the race to dominate the LLM landscape has only intensified, with tech giants like Meta, Microsoft, and Google racing to have the best model possible. But now there is also Anthropic, Mistral, Deepseek and more that are coming to the scene and impacting the industry at scale.</p>
<p>As companies rush to deploy AI assistants, classifiers, and a myriad of other LLM-powered tools, a critical question remains: are we building securely ?  As we highlighted last year, the rapid adoption sometimes feels like we forgot the fundamental security principles, opening the door to novel and familiar vulnerabilities alike.</p>
<p>AI agents are rapidly emerging as the next game-changer in the world of artificial intelligence. These intelligent entities leverage advanced chains of thought reasoning, a process where the model generates a coherent sequence of internal reasoning steps to solve complex tasks. By documenting their thought processes, these agents not only enhance their decision-making capabilities but also provide transparency, allowing developers and researchers to understand and refine their performance. This dynamic combination of autonomous action and visible reasoning is paving the way for AI systems that are more adaptive, interpretable, and reliable. As we witness an increasing number of applications. from interactive assistants to sophisticated decision-support systems. The integration of chain-of-thought reasoning in AI agents is setting a new standard for what these models can achieve in real-world scenarios.</p>
<p>Google, to their credit, are actively recognising this emerging frontier of AI security, and they started early on.  Their "LLM bugSWAT" events, held in vibrant locales like Las Vegas, are a testament to their commitment to proactive security red teaming.  These events challenge researchers worldwide to rigorously test their AI systems, seeking out the vulnerabilities that might otherwise slip through the cracks.</p>
<p>And guess what ? We answered the call again in 2024 !  Justin and I returned to the bugSWAT event in Las Vegas, and this time, our efforts paid off in a big way.  Thanks to a brand new vulnerability in Gemini,  the one we’re about to detail, we were incredibly honored to be awarded the Most Valuable Hacker (MVH) title at this year's Las Vegas bugSWAT !</p>
<p><img src="https://www.landh.tech/images/articles/mvh-award.jpeg" alt="Google MVH Award"></p>
<p><em>Picture taken with our MVH award and 2 awesome Googlers &lt;3</em></p>
<p>So, prepare to dive deep once more.  This isn't just a repeat performance; it's a whole new vulnerability that we are about to show you ;)</p>
<h2>Discovering the new Gemini</h2>
<p>The Google team granted us early access to a preview of the next Gemini update, one that had several exciting new features. Along with this exclusive access, we received detailed documentation explaining these features and their intended functionalities. The goal was to fully explore and test these capabilities from an attacker’s perspective.</p>
<p>It all started with a simple prompt. We asked Gemini:</p>
<pre><code>run hello world in python3
</code></pre>
<p>Gemini provided the code, and the interface offered the enticing "Run in Sandbox" button. Intrigued, we started exploring.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.landh.tech/images/articles/run-hello-world-python3.png" alt="Run Hello World Python3"></p>
<h2>Gemini's Python Playground – A Secure Space... or Was It ?</h2>
<p>Gemini at the time offered a Python Sandbox Interpreter. Think of it as a safe space where you can run Python code generated by the AI itself, or even your own custom scripts, right within the Gemini environment. This sandbox, powered by Google's Gvisor in a GRTE (Google Runtime Environment), is designed to be secure. The idea is you can experiment with code without risking any harm to the underlying system, a crucial feature for testing and development.</p>
<p>gVisor is a user-space kernel developed by Google that acts as an intermediary between containerized applications and the host operating system. By intercepting system calls made by applications, it enforces strict security boundaries that reduce the risk of container escapes and limit potential damage from compromised processes. Rather than relying solely on traditional OS-level isolation, gVisor implements a minimal, tailored subset of kernel functionalities, thereby reducing the attack surface while still maintaining reasonable performance. This innovative approach enhances the security of container environments, making gVisor an essential tool for safely running and managing containerized workloads.</p>
<p>As security researchers and bug bounty hunters, we know that this gVisor sandbox is secured with multiple layers of defense and from what we’ve seen no one managed to escape this sandbox. Actually a sandbox escape could award you a $100k bounty:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.landh.tech/images/articles/sandbox-escape-reward.png" alt="Sandbox Escape VRP Reward"></p>
<p>While it might be possible to still escape it, this is a whole different set of challenges than what we were looking for.</p>
<p>However, sandboxes are not always meant to be escaped since there are a lot of cases where there is stuff inside the sandbox itself that can help us leak data. This idea, shared with us by a Googler from the security team, was to be able to have shell access inside the Sandbox itself and try to find any piece of data that wasn't supposed to be accessible. The main problem was the following: <strong>This sandbox can only run a custom compiled Python binary.</strong></p>
<h2>Mapping the Territory</h2>
<p>The first thing we saw is that it was also possible from the Front End to entirely rewrite the Python code and run our arbitrary version in the sandbox. Our first step was to understand the structure of this sandbox. We suspected there might be interesting files lurking around. Since we can’t pop a shell, we checked which libraries were available in this custom compiled Python binary. We found out that os was present ! Great, we can then use it to map the filesystem.</p>
<p>We wrote the following Python Code:</p>
<pre><code>import os

def get_size_formatted(size_in_bytes):
    if size_in_bytes &gt;= 1024 ** 3:
        size = size_in_bytes / (1024 ** 3)
        unit = "Go"
    elif size_in_bytes &gt;= 1024 ** 2:
        size = size_in_bytes / (1024 ** 2)
        unit = "Mb"
    else:
        size = size_in_bytes / 1024
        unit = "Ko"
    return f"{size:.2f} {unit}"

def lslR(path):
    try:
        # Determine if the path is a directory or a file
        if os.path.isdir(path):
            type_flag = 'd'
            total_size = sum(os.path.getsize(os.path.join(path, f)) for f in os.listdir(path))
        else:
            type_flag = 'f'
            total_size = os.path.getsize(path)
        
        size_formatted = get_size_formatted(total_size)
        
        # Check read and write permissions
        read_flag = 'r' if os.access(path, os.R_OK) else '-'
        write_flag = 'w' if os.access(path, os.W_OK) else '-'
        
        # Print the type, permissions, size, and path
        print(f"{type_flag}{read_flag}{write_flag} - {size_formatted} - {path}")
        
        # If it's a directory, recursively print the contents
        if type_flag == 'd':
            for entry in os.listdir(path):
                entry_path = os.path.join(path, entry)
                lslR(entry_path)
    except PermissionError:
        print(f"d-- - 0Ko - {path} (PermissionError: cannot access)")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"--- - 0Ko - {path} (Error: {e})")
</code></pre>
<p>The goal for this code was to have some kind of recursive listing of files and directories function to be able to see which files are present, their size and also their permissions.</p>
<p>We’ve used the function to list the <code>lslR("/usr")</code> directory.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.landh.tech/images/articles/sandbox-listing.jpeg" alt="Sandbox Listing"></p>
<p>This call identified a binary file located at <code>/usr/bin/entry/entry_point</code>. This sounds juicy !</p>
<p><img src="https://i.giphy.com/3o6MbnvuZWdgL2JI88.webp" alt="Sniff"></p>
<h2>Leak the entry_point file</h2>
<p>Our next move was to extract this file, but with it being 579Mb in size, directly base64 encoding and printing it in the Front End wasn't an option, it caused the entire sandbox to hang until it eventually timed out.</p>
<p>We attempted to see if we could run TCP, HTTP, and DNS calls to exfiltrate information. Intriguingly, all our outbound connection attempts failed, the sandbox appeared completely isolated from the external network. This led to an interesting puzzle: if the sandbox is so tightly isolated that it cannot make external calls, how does it interface with Google services like Google Flights and others ? Well … we might be able to answer this later ;D</p>
<p>So we needed to exfiltrate this binary by printing in the console into chunks, for that we used the seek() function to walk through the binary file and retrieve the entire binary in chunks of 10 MB.</p>
<pre><code>import os
import base64

def read_and_encode(file_path, kilobytes):
    try:
        # Calculate the number of bytes to read
        num_bytes = kilobytes * 1024
        
        # Open the file and read the specified number of bytes
        with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
            file_content = file.read(num_bytes)
        
        # Base64 encode the bytes
        encoded_content = base64.b64encode(file_content)
        
        # Print the encoded string
        print(encoded_content.decode('utf-8'))
    
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"FileNotFoundError: {file_path} does not exist")
    except PermissionError:
        print(f"PermissionError: Cannot access {file_path}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

read_and_encode("/usr/bin/entry/entry_point", 10000)
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.landh.tech/images/articles/sandbox-exfil-chunks.png" alt="Sandbox Exfil Chunks"></p>
<p>We then used <a href="https://caido.io/">Caido</a> to catch the request in our proxy that would run the sandbox call and fetch the result and then send it into the Automate feature. The Automate feature allows you to send requests in bulk. This feature provides a flexible way to initiate bruteforce/fuzzing to rapidly modify certain parameters of requests using wordlists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note from Lupin: In the article it seems like a straightforward path, but actually we took several hours to get to that point. It was 3 am we were hacking with Justin and I was sleeping on my keyboard while Justin was exfiltrating the binary using Caido.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once we had all the base64 chunks, we reconstructed the entire file locally and we were ready to see its content.</p>
<h2>How to read this file ?</h2>
<h3>file command ?</h3>
<p>Running the file command on the binary revealed its identity as an <code>binary: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /usr/grte/v5/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</code> This  confirms that the file is a binary. Mmmmmh what can we do with this ?</p>
<h3>strings command ?</h3>
<p>When we executed the strings command, the output was particularly intriguing due to multiple references to <code>google3</code>, Google’s internal repository. This pointed to the presence of internal data paths and code snippets that were never meant for external exposure, clearly indicating that the binary contains traces of Google’s proprietary software. But is there actually any security implication ?</p>
<h3>Binwalk FTW !</h3>
<p>The real breakthrough came when using Binwalk. This tool managed to extract an entire file structure from within the binary, revealing a comprehensive sandbox layout. The extraction uncovered multiple directories and files, painting a detailed picture of the internal architecture and exposing components where our reaction upon what we found was like ... OMG.</p>
<h2>Wait … is that internal Source Code ?</h2>
<p>When digging into the extract generated by our binwalk analysis, we unexpectedly found internal source code. The extraction revealed entire directories of proprietary Google source code. But is it sensitive ?</p>
<h3>Google3 Directory with Python Code</h3>
<p>In the binwalk extracted directory we can find a <code>google3</code> directory with the following files:</p>

<p>In the <code>assistant</code> directory, internal Gemini code related to RPC calls (used for handling requests via tools like YouTube, Google Flights, Google Maps, etc.) was also discovered. The directory structure is as follows:</p>

<h3>A Closer Look at the Python Code</h3>
<p>Inside the file <code>google3/assistant/boq/lamda/execution_box/images/py_interpreter.py</code>, a snippet of code reveals:</p>
<pre><code># String for attempted script dump detection:
  snippet = (  # pylint: disable=unused-variable
      "3AVp#dzcQj$U?uLOj+Gl]GlY&lt;+Z8DnKh"  # pylint: disable=unused-variable
  )
</code></pre>
<p>This snippet appears to serve as a safeguard against unauthorized script dumping, underscoring that the code was never intended for public exposure.</p>
<p><img src="https://c.tenor.com/3eIvVsG3yPYAAAAd/tenor.gif" alt="Mind-Blown"></p>
<p>After a thorough review, the inclusion of what appeared to be internal Google3 code was, in fact, a deliberate choice… Too bad x)</p>
<p>The Python code, despite its anti-dumping mechanism that might initially indicate restricted access, had been explicitly approved for public exposure by the Google Security Team well before launch. Although these measures were originally designed to prevent unintended printing, they were retained because … why not ?</p>
<p>But we didn’t leave this sandbox alone, we knew we were close to something huge ! ;D</p>
<h2>Digging the main logic of the Sandbox</h2>
<p>While digging deeper into the Python code, we noticed that, as expected, this sandbox was communicating with external Google servers to perform activities such as fetch data from Google Flights or other Google services.</p>
<p>This was implemented via a python class (<code>google3.assistant.boq.lamda.execution_box.sandbox_interface</code>) which exposed various functions like <code>_set_reader_and_writer</code>  that could be called.</p>
<pre><code>def _set_reader_and_writer(
    reader_handle: io.BufferedReader | None,
    writer_handle: io.BufferedWriter | None,
) -&gt; None:
  """Sets the reader and writer handles for rpcs.

  Should be called before running any user code that might
  import async_sandbox_rpc

  Args:
    reader_handle: the handle through which to receive incoming RpcResponses. If
      None will default to legacy behavior (/dev/fd/3)
    writer_handle: the handle through which to receive incoming RpcRequests. If.
      None will default to legacy behavior (/dev/fd/4)
  """
  with _INIT_LOCK:
    global _READER_HANDLE
    global _WRITER_HANDLE
    _READER_HANDLE, _WRITER_HANDLE = reader_handle, writer_handle
</code></pre>
<pre><code>def run_tool(
    name: str, operation_id: str, parameters: str
) -&gt; sandbox_rpc_pb2.RunToolResponse:
  """Runs a tool with the given name and id, passing in parameters.

  Args:
    name: The name of the tool.
    operation_id: The name of the operation to perform.
    parameters: The parameters to pass to the tool.

  Returns:
    A RunToolResponse containing the response from the tool.
  """
  result = make_rpc(
      sandbox_rpc_pb2.RpcRequest(
          run_tool_request=sandbox_rpc_pb2.RunToolRequest(
              name=name, operation_id=operation_id, parameters=parameters
          )
      )
  )

  if result and result.HasField("run_tool_response"):
    return result.run_tool_response
  else:
    return sandbox_rpc_pb2.RunToolResponse(response="")
</code></pre>
<p>We would provide various pieces of data to these functions, they would serialize the data into the protobuf compatible format, and then call out over RPC by writing to a local file descriptor <code>5</code>. The response could then be read by reading from local file descriptor <code>7</code>. By utilizing the protos that were found in the massive binary, we were able to craft messages to and from this RPC server, and call these Google tools directly.</p>
<p>However, we noticed something interesting, not every sandboxes would have the same set of Google services available. It would depend if the sandbox was spawned by the Front End to be able to run Python source code, or by the Google Agent. What do we mean by that ?</p>
<h3>ReAct Research paper !</h3>
<p>Before explaining the next part, we need to explain that Google’s team showed us the following research paper that Gemini is based of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629">REACT: SYNERGIZING REASONING AND ACTING IN LANGUAGE MODELS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This paper introduces a novel approach (at the time) where language models alternate between generating reasoning traces and executing specific actions, effectively merging thought and behavior in an interleaved manner. In practice, this means that as the model reasons through a problem, creating a transparent trail of thought that helps it plan, track, and adjust its actions, it simultaneously interacts with external sources to gather additional data when needed. This dynamic interplay not only boosts the model’s performance by mitigating common issues like hallucination and error propagation but also makes its decision-making process more interpretable and controllable for human operators.</p>
<p>By integrating both internal reasoning and external knowledge, ReAct offers a flexible and general framework that excels across a variety of tasks, ranging from question answering and fact verification to text-based games and web navigation. In essence, ReAct leverages the combined strengths of reasoning and acting to create more robust, human-aligned, and versatile language models.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.landh.tech/images/articles/react-paper.png" alt="ReAct"></p>
<p>Ok, but why do we need to understand this ? Well, if we follow the logic of this paper, basically Gemini can prompt itself several times in order to refine the commands and have a proper chain of thoughts.</p>
<p>If a user asks “What is the earliest flight between Toronto and New York ?”, Gemini would have roughly a chain of thought like:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The user is asking me to search the earliest flight between Toronto and New York</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating a plan like:</p>
<ol>
<li>I need to run a Python code that will connect to Google Flights tool</li>
<li>The code needs to find all flights from today to next week from YYZ airport to JFK airport</li>
<li>The code needs to sort by date the flights and take the first item</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the plan done, it would generate the code with the available Tools that the Agent has</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the code generated, it would spawn a sandbox with the right privileges (eg: having access to the Google Flights tool through the file descriptor)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the code, process the output</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Makes a response to the user</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So our theory was the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if we could do a secondary prompt injection in the planning section of Gemini in order to have access to a more privileged sandbox ?</li>
</ul>
<p>With the help of the Google Security Team, we tested this idea and observed that, depending on factors like the generation seed and temperature (all the usual probabilistic LLM nuances), we could occasionally access what appeared to be a more privileged sandbox.</p>
<p>By “more privileged sandbox,” we mean one that can access the extensions through two new file descriptors. These file descriptors are always present but aren’t always actively listening, when the agent calls the sandbox, they monitor for any calls to the extensions (Google services) so that we can interact with the API, whereas if accessed through the Python interpreter, those extensions remain inaccessible.</p>
<p>This led us to believe that there was a real opportunity for a P0 vulnerability: there was a specific message handler that might allow a file read on Google’s internal infrastructure, and we were hopeful that the sandbox with the tool extension could initiate an RPC call to this specific tool. Given the probabilistic nature of the attack, which made it difficult to reproduce consistently, we have Google Security Team assess this situation. Ultimately, their review revealed that the suspicious message handler was not available via RPC and could only be called externally.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.landh.tech/images/articles/sandbox-answer.png" alt="Sandbox Answer"></p>
<p>Even though our tests were limited, the core idea still has some real potential if we push it further. Running code in the sandbox context isn’t meant to give extra powers, it's treated as untrusted, with safety checks outside the sandbox and every tool call being filtered. But being able to run code does offer some neat benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reliability</strong>: Once you can run code, you can trigger actions more consistently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chaining/Complexity</strong>: Controlling multiple tools or fine-tuning parameters via plain text is tough; code execution could let you build more complex chains, even if safety measures are still in place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tool Output Poisoning</strong>: You might be able to manipulate a tool’s output more effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leaks</strong>: There could be other hidden parts of the environment that, if exposed, might offer extra advantages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This shows that our idea still holds promise for further escalation. And that “leaks” potential, we wanted to see if we could at least confirm this one theory …</p>
<h2>We found our leak ;D</h2>
<p>While digging deeper, we uncovered several ways to leak proto files. In case you're not familiar, proto files (short for Protocol Buffer files) are like the blueprints of data, defining how messages are structured and how information is exchanged between different parts of the system. At first glance, they might seem harmless, but leaking these files can give a pretty detailed peek into Google’s internal architecture.</p>
<h3>Exposing classification.proto</h3>
<p>It turns out that by running a command like:</p>
<pre><code>strings entry_point &gt; stringsoutput.txt
</code></pre>
<p>and then searching for “Dogfood” in the resulting file, we managed to retrieve snippets of the internal protos. Parts of the extracted content included the metadata description of extremely sensitive protos. It didn’t contain user data by itself but those files are internal categories Google uses to <strong>classify</strong> user data.</p>
<p><em>For legal reasons we can’t show the result of this command x)</em></p>
<p><img src="https://www.landh.tech/images/articles/legal-reasons.png" alt="legal reasons"></p>
<p>Why search for the string “Dogfood” specifically ? At Google, "dogfood" refers to the practice of using pre-release versions of the company's own products and prototypes internally to test and refine them before a public launch. It allows devs to test the deployment and potential issues in these products, before going to production.</p>
<p>Moreover, there was the following exposed file, <code>privacy/data_governance/attributes/proto/classification.proto</code>, which details how data is classified within Google. Although the file includes references to associated documentation, those documents remain highly confidential and should not be publicly accessible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note from Lupin again: This was found the next day of our all-nighter where we exfiltrated the binary file. We were in a suite in an Hotel Room booked by Google, and we were working with the security team to understand what we had found the previous night. This time Justin was the one who slept on the couch hahaha ! This bug was really time consuming but so fun ! 😀</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exposing Internal Security Proto Definitions</p>
<p>The same output also reveals numerous internal proto files that should have remained hidden. Running:</p>
<pre><code>cat stringsoutput.txt| grep '\.proto' | grep 'security'
</code></pre>
<p>lists several sensitive files, including:</p>
<pre><code>security/thinmint/proto/core/thinmint_core.proto
security/thinmint/proto/thinmint.proto
security/credentials/proto/authenticator.proto
security/data_access/proto/standard_dat_scope.proto
security/loas/l2/proto/credstype.proto
security/credentials/proto/end_user_credentials.proto
security/loas/l2/proto/usertype.proto
security/credentials/proto/iam_request_attributes.proto
security/util/proto/permission.proto
security/loas/l2/proto/common.proto
ops/security/sst/signalserver/proto/ss_data.proto
security/credentials/proto/data_access_token_scope.proto
security/loas/l2/proto/identity_types.proto
security/credentials/proto/principal.proto
security/loas/l2/proto/instance.proto
security/credentials/proto/justification.proto
</code></pre>
<p>When looking in the binary strings for <code>security/credentials/proto/authenticator.proto</code> confirms that its data is indeed exposed.</p>
<h2>Why were those protos there?</h2>
<p>As we said previously, the Google Security Team thoroughly reviewed everything in the sandbox and gave a green light for public disclosure. However, the build pipeline for compiling the sandbox binary included an automated step that adds security proto files to a binary whenever it detects that the binary might need them to enforce internal rules.</p>
<p>In this particular case, that step wasn’t necessary, resulting in the unintended inclusion of highly confidential internal protos in the wild !</p>
<p>As bug bounty hunters, it's essential to deeply understand the business rules that govern a company’s operations. We reported these proto leaks because we know that Google treats them as highly confidential information that should never be exposed. The more we understand the inner workings and priorities of our target, the better we are at identifying and flaging those subtle bugs that might otherwise slip under the radar. This deep knowledge not only helps us pinpoint vulnerabilities but also ensures our reports are aligned with the critical security concerns of the organization.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Before we wrap things up, it’s worth mentioning how vital it is to test these cutting-edge A.I. systems before they go live. With so many interconnections and cool features, like even a simple sandbox that can access different extensions, there’s always the potential for unexpected surprises. We’ve seen firsthand that when all these parts work together, even a small oversight can open up new avenues for issues. So, thorough testing isn’t just a best practice; it’s the only way to make sure everything stays secure and functions as intended.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, what made this whole experience so memorable was the pure fun of the ride. Cracking vulnerabilities, exploring hidden code, and pushing the limits of Gemini's sandbox was as much about the challenge as it was about the excitement of the hunt. The people we’ve met at the bugSWAT event in Las Vegas were all awesome. The shared laughs over unexpected twists, and the thrill of outsmarting complex systems turned this technical journey into an adventure we’ll never forget. It’s moments like these, where serious hacking meets good times, that remind us why we do what we do.</p>
<p>Finally, a huge shout-out to all the other winners and participants who made bugSWAT 2024 such a blast. We want to congratulate Sreeram &amp; Sivanesh for their killer teamwork, Alessandro for coming so close to that top spot, and En for making it onto the podium. It was an absolute thrill meeting so many amazing hackers and security pros, your energy and passion made this event unforgettable. We can’t wait to see everyone again at the next bugSWAT, and until then, keep hacking and having fun !</p>
<p>And of course, thanks to the Google Security team ! As always you rock ❤️</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Since the mid-1970s, almost every jazz musician has owned a copy of the same book. It has a peach-colored cover, a chunky, 1970s-style logo, and a black plastic binding. It’s delightfully homemade-looking—like it was printed by a bunch of teenagers at a Kinkos. And inside is the sheet music for hundreds of common jazz tunes—also known as jazz “standards”—all meticulously notated by hand. It’s called the Real Book.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/history_page_1.jpeg" alt="" width="322" height="374" srcset="https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/history_page_1.jpeg 388w, https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/history_page_1-300x349.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px"></p>
<p>But if you were going to music school in the 1970s, you couldn’t just buy a copy of the Real Book at the campus bookstore. Because the Real Book… was <em>illegal</em>. The world’s most popular collection of jazz music was a totally unlicensed publication. It was a self-published book created without permission from music publishers or songwriters. It was duplicated at photocopy shops and sold on street corners, out of the trunks of cars, and under the table at music stores where people used secret code words to make the exchange. The full story of how the Real Book came to be this bootleg bible of jazz is a complicated one. It’s a story about what happens when an insurgent, improvisational art form like jazz gets codified and becomes something that you can learn from a book.</p>
<h2>The History of Fake Books</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image011.png" alt="" width="207" height="273"><a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-story-of-fake-books-barry-kernfeld/1111519327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barry Kernfeld</a></p>
<p> is a musicologist who has written a lot about the history of jazz and music piracy. Kernfeld says that long before the Real Book ever came out, jazz musicians were relying on collections of music they called fake books. Kernfeld says that the story of the first fake book began in the 1940s. “A man named George Goodwin in New York City, involved in radio in the early 1940s, was getting a little frustrated with all the intricacies of tracking licensing. And so he invented this thing that he called the Tune-Dex,” explains Kernfeld.</p>
<figure id="attachment_37182" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-37182"><img decoding="async" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TuneDex-600x733.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="733" srcset="https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TuneDex-600x733.jpeg 600w, https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TuneDex-728x889.jpeg 728w, https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TuneDex-300x366.jpeg 300w, https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TuneDex.jpeg 1168w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-37182">TuneDex card via <a href="https://blog.library.gsu.edu/2010/10/13/popular-music-tune-dex-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Georgia State University Library</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Tune-Dex was an index card catalog designed for radio station employees to keep track of the songs they were playing on air. On one side the cards had information about a particular song, such as the composer, the publisher, and anything that one would need to know for payment rights. On the other side of the card were a few lines of bite-sized sheet music—just the song’s melody, lyrics, and chords so that radio station employees could glance at it and quickly recall the song. This abbreviated musical notation also made the cards useful to another group of people: working jazz musicians.</p>

<p>As a Black art form, jazz had developed out of a mix of other Black music traditions including spirituals and the blues. By the 1940s, a lot of “jazz” was popular dance music, and many jazz musicians were making their money playing live gigs in small clubs and bars. The standard jazz repertoire was mostly well-known pop songs from Broadway, or New York’s songwriting factory: “Tin Pan Alley.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Night And Day - Cole Porter" width="267" height="200" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5WX_fKVWX2s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Jazz musicians would riff and freestyle over these songs. The art of improvisation has always been a key art form of jazz music. But what made the average gigging trumpeter or sax player truly valuable was their ability to play any one of hundreds of songs right there on the spot.</p>
<p>To be prepared for any request, musicians would bring stacks and stacks of sheet music to every gig. But lugging around a giant pile of paper could be really cumbersome—this is where the Tune-Dex came in. Someone figured out that you could gather together a bunch of Tune-Dex cards, print copies of them on sheets of paper, add a table of contents and a simple binding, and then sell the finished product directly to musicians in the form of a book. They called them “fake books” because they helped musicians fake their way through unfamiliar songs. These first fake books were cheaper than regular sheet music, and a lot more organized. They became an essential tool for this entire class of working musicians.
</p>
<h2>Bootleggers</h2>
<p>
Musicians loved these new fake books, but the music publishers hated them. They wanted musicians to buy legal sheet music, and so the publishing companies started cracking down on fake book bootleggers. That, of course, didn’t stop the bootleggers and by the 1950s, there were countless illegal fake books in existence, which were being used in nightclubs all across the country.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Rare Live Jazz at New Orleans Bar - 1950's" width="267" height="200" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LLDELtfUsaQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As helpful as fake books were, they had a lot of problems. They were notoriously illegible and confusingly laid out. The other big problem with these fake books at this point was that the music inside felt really out of date. The fake books hadn’t changed since the mid-40s, but jazz had. Disillusioned by commercial jazz that appealed to mainstream white audiences, a new generation of Black musicians took jazz improvisation to a new level. They experimented with more angular harmonies, technically demanding melodies and blindingly fast tempos. Their new style was called bebop.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dizzy Gillespie - Bebop" width="267" height="200" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/09BB1pci8_o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bebop was just the beginning. Over several decades, jazz exploded into this constellation of different styles. Meanwhile, the economics of jazz shifted too. There were fewer clubs, smaller paychecks, and more university jazz programs with steady teaching gigs. The ivory tower, not the nightclub, increasingly became a place for young musicians to learn, and for established musicians to earn a living. And if you’re going to jazz school, you need jazz books.</p>
<figure id="attachment_37183" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-37183"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1599px-WTB_Berklee_3-600x400.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1599px-WTB_Berklee_3-600x400.jpeg 600w, https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1599px-WTB_Berklee_3-728x485.jpeg 728w, https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1599px-WTB_Berklee_3-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1599px-WTB_Berklee_3-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1599px-WTB_Berklee_3.jpeg 1599w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-37183">Berklee College of Music.

<p>The fake books at the time hadn’t kept up with the music. They still contained the same old-fashioned collection of standards with the same old-fashioned collection of chord changes. If a young jazz musician wanted to try and play like Charles Mingus or Sonny Rollins, they weren’t going to learn from a book. That is… until two college kids invented the Real Book.
</p>
<h2>The Two Guys</h2>
<p>
In the mid-70s, Steve Swallow began teaching at Boston’s Berklee College of Music, an elite private music school that boasted one of the first jazz performance programs in the country. Swallow had only been teaching at Berklee for a few months when two students approached him about a secret project. “I keep referring them to them as ‘the two guys who wrote the book,’ because…they swore me to secrecy. They made me agree that I would not divulge their names,” explains Swallow. The “two guys” wanted to make a new fake book, one that actually catered to the needs of contemporary jazz musicians and reflected the current state of jazz. And they needed Swallow’s help.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="&quot;O Grande Amor&quot; Stan Getz, Gary Burton, Steve Swallow, Roy Haynes.1966 featuring Steve Swallow" width="267" height="200" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z85JoHA9h34?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From the very beginning, the students envisioned the Real Book as a cooler and more contemporary fake book than the stodgy, outdated ones they’d grown up with. They wanted it to include new songs from jazz fusion artists like Herbie Hancock, and free jazz pioneers like Ornette Coleman who were pushing the boundaries of the genre. They also wanted to include the old jazz standards from Broadway and Tin Pan Alley, but they wanted to update those classics with alternate chord changes that reflected the way modern musicians, like Miles Davis, were actually playing them.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Herbie Hancock Trio - Full Concert - 08/14/88 - Newport Jazz Festival (OFFICIAL)" width="267" height="200" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jy1ICphDYTQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Modern jazz musicians had altered a lot of classic standards over the years, with new harmonies and more complex chord changes. And to capture these new sounds, the students spent hours listening to recordings and transcribing what they heard, as best they could. It was a huge undertaking because most of these chord changes had never actually been written down. They weren’t necessarily thinking about it like this at the time, but the students were effectively establishing a new set of standardized harmonies for a handful of classic songs.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/0af38b0aa71f96f108ae83a243e5de8d.jpeg" alt="" width="494" height="640" srcset="https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/0af38b0aa71f96f108ae83a243e5de8d.jpeg 494w, https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/0af38b0aa71f96f108ae83a243e5de8d-300x389.jpeg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px"></p>

<p>The music wasn’t the only part of their new fake book that the students wanted to improve. They also wanted to fix the aesthetic problems with the old fake books, and make something that was nice to look at and easy to read. One of “the two guys” notated all of the music by hand in this very distinctive and expressive script. He also designed and silk-screened the logo on the front cover: “The Real Book,” written in chunky, SchoolHouse Rock-style block letters.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-11.46.19-AM-600x273.png" alt="" width="600" height="273" srcset="https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-11.46.19-AM-600x273.png 600w, https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-11.46.19-AM-728x332.png 728w, https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-11.46.19-AM-300x137.png 300w, https://99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-11.46.19-AM.png 1462w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<p>By the summer of 1975, the book was done, and the students took it to local photocopying shops where they cranked out hundreds of copies to sell directly to other students and a few local businesses near Berklee. Overnight, almost everyone had to have one. As the Real Book’s notoriety grew, so did the demand. The two students hadn’t printed enough copies to keep up, but it turns out, they didn’t need to. Not long after they created a few hundred copies of the book, bootleg versions began popping up all over the world. The Real Book had taken on a life of its own, and the students ironically found themselves in the same position as the music publishers and songwriters they’d originally cut out of the process, as they watched unlicensed copies of their work get duplicated and sold. After they released the first edition of the Real Book, the students put out two more editions to correct mistakes, and then their work was done. But the Real Book lived on, copied over and over again by new generations of bootleggers. And as the number of students in elite conservatory jazz programs continued to swell over the next few decades, the Real Book, with its modern repertoire, reharmonized standards, and beautiful handwriting, became the de-facto textbook for this new legion of jazz students. The unofficial official handbook of jazz.</p>

<h2>The Real Real Book</h2>
<p>
Just like with old fake books, the success of the Real Book was a major problem for music publishers. Some companies released their own fake books, but they never managed to compete with the Real Book. The popularity of the Real Book meant that lots of people weren’t getting paid for their work. But in the mid-2000s, music executive Jeff Schroedl and the publisher Hal Leonard decided, if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em. They went through the Real Book page by page, secured the rights to almost every song, and published a completely legal version. You don’t need to buy the Real Book out of the back of someone’s car anymore. It’s available at your local music shop. They even wanted the same handwriting. Hal Leonard actually hired a copyist to mimic the old Real Book’s iconic script and turn it into a digital font, which means a digital copy of a physical copy of one anonymous Berklee student’s handwriting from the mid-70s will continue to live on for as long as new editions of the book are published.</p>

<p>When Hal Leonard finally published the legal version of the Real Book in 2004, it was great news if you were a composer with a song in there. You’d finally be getting royalties from the sale of the most popular jazz fake book of all time. But that didn’t totally solve the intellectual property problems with the Real Book. While the legalization of the Real Book did resolve most of its flagrant copyright violations, it didn’t clear up authorship disputes that go back to the early days of jazz. Many jazz songs arise out of collective tinkering and improvising in jam sessions. It’s sometimes quite hard to say who exactly wrote a given song, and power dynamics often impacted whose name actually got listed as an official songwriter. And so there are likely many musicians whose names will never appear on the songs they helped write, even if those songs appear in the legal Real Book.
</p>
<h2>Useful Tool, or Reductive Cheat Sheet?</h2>
<p>
Even if we put the intellectual property questions aside for a second, fake books like the Real Book still have plenty of critics. Nicholas Payton is a musician and record label owner, and he compares the Real Book to a study guide or a cheat sheet—a way to distill this complicated art form into a manageable packet of digestible information. To Payton, jazz isn’t just information to be learned. It’s a way of thinking and a form of expression. And it’s fundamentally a Black cultural phenomenon that can’t be taken out of its historical context. Payton says that reading books like the Real Book, even going to music school, can really only get you so far. If you want to learn to play, at some point you’re going to have to immerse yourself in the culture of the music. For Payton (and many musicians) learning directly from elders, in person, is a crucial part of what it means to really know the art form.</p>
<p>There’s also the question of codification, and whether it’s useful to have one songbook filled with definitive versions of all these jazz tunes. Carolyn Wilkins has taught ensembles at Berklee College of Music, and she says that the chords that are written down in the Real Book sometimes get treated like the <em>right</em> way to play a particular song. But even though jazz has all of these “standards,” they’re not supposed to be played in one standard way. As you listen to different recordings of the same song by different jazz artists, it becomes obvious that there’s no one right way to play it. Wilkins says that the Real Book does have its place in jazz education. Over her years at Berklee, she’s seen how it can be a useful starting place as a tool to bring young jazz musicians together. The key, she says, is to treat the Real Book as a starting place. From there you need to go out and explore all the other ways people have played a particular song. “And then ultimately you must find your own way.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>India is a union of 28 states (provinces). The population in some of these states is bigger than that of the largest European countries. For example, Uttar Pradesh is home to more than <span>240 million</span> people, almost three times the population of Germany. Although a part of a federal union, every state has a unique history, shaped by its environment and natural resources, princely or British colonial heritage, language and culture. Since the end of British rule in the region in 1947, their economic trajectories have <span>diverged, too.</span></p>
<p>With roughly <span>35 million</span> people, Kerala, which sits along India’s southwestern tip on the Indian Ocean, is among the smaller Indian states, though it is densely populated. In the 1970s, Kerala’s average income was about two-thirds of the Indian average, making it among the poorest states in India. This difference persisted through the 1980s. In the coming decades, a miracle occurred. Kerala, one of the poorest regions in India, became one of the richest. In 2022, Kerala’s per-capita income was <span>50-60 per</span> cent higher than the national average. What happened?</p>
<p>Even when it was poor, Kerala was different. Though income-poor, Kerala enjoyed the highest average literacy levels, health conditions and life expectancy – components of human development – in all of India. Among economists in the 1970s and ’80s and among locals, ‘Kerala is different’ became a catchphrase. But why, and different from whom? One big difference Kerala presented was with North India, which had an abysmal record of education and healthcare. While the population grew at more than <span>2 per</span> cent per year in the rest of India, Kerala’s population growth rates remained significantly lower in the 1970s. High literacy and healthcare levels contributed to this transition.</p>
<p>Kerala’s unusual mix of high levels of human development and low incomes drew wide attention, including from leading scholars. Among the most influential writers, <span>K N Raj</span> played a big part in <a href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/415172?ln=en&amp;v=pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">projecting</a> Kerala as a model for other states. Anthropologists like Polly Hill and Robin Jeffrey drew <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/312633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attention</a> to some of the unique features of the society that led to these achievements. In a series of influential <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691160795/an-uncertain-glory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">works</a>, the Nobel-laureate <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/why-amartya-sen-remains-the-centurys-great-critic-of-capitalism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amartya Sen</a> and his co-author the economist Jean Drèze praised Kerala’s development model for prioritising health and education, even with limited resources, and claimed that this pathway led to significant improvements in quality of life. Kerala vindicated the intuition that Sen and others held that health and education improved wellbeing and shaped economic change by enhancing choices and capabilities.</p>
<p>Why do Kerala’s differences matter? What lessons did the economists draw from the state’s unique record? Around 1975, India’s economic growth had faltered, and a debate started over whether the country should give up its socialist economic policy in favour of a more market-oriented one, in which the government would take a backseat. Kerala suggested three lessons for those engaged in the debate: <span>(a) income</span> growth rate was a weak measure of standards of living; <span>(b) what</span> mattered was quality of life, including education, good health and longer lives; and <span>(c) the</span> government was necessary to ensure investment in schools and hospitals. The three lessons would coalesce into the Kerala Model, an alternative recipe for development to the neoliberal model then being pushed by Right-wing lobbies.</p>
<p>But Kerala was about to grow even more different, confounding orthodoxies in political science and economics. In the 2000s, average income in the state forged ahead of the Indian average. Compared with Indian averages, the post-1990 growth record was less impressive regarding human development, as India caught up with Kerala (see graph below). The forging-ahead in income was offbeat and is still poorly understood. This question remains unanswered because, so far, the attention of economists has been elsewhere – welfare policies – whereas the income turnaround suggests an emerging pattern of private investment that strides in basic health and literacy alone cannot explain.</p>

<p>Before we tackle that question, it will be useful to discuss the huge presence of the state in development studies. Where does it come from? Why does the state fascinate so many social scientists?</p>
<p><span>F</span>rom a historical perspective, Kerala has at least four distinct qualities that most states in India do not share. First, it has a centuries-long history of trade and migration, particularly with West Asia and Europe. Second, Kerala is rich in natural resources, which have been commercially exploited. Third, Kerala boasts a highly literate, skilled and mobile workforce. Finally, the state has a strong Left political movement. Any story we tell about its advances in health and education or its recent income growth must refer to some of these longstanding variables.</p>
<p>Why was Kerala different? In the minds of many economists, the state’s heritage of Leftist trade unions (more on this later) and successive rule by Leftist political parties helped provide the foundation for strong human development. Socialism was not just a popular ideology but had a real chance to deliver in this state. Others stressed geography, princely heritage and social reform movements. For example, the British anthropologist Polly Hill noted that Kerala differed due to its coastal position, semi-equatorial climate, maritime tradition, mixed-faith society and princely rule. The combined share of the <a href="https://censusofindia.net/kerala/32#Religion_Population" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">population</a> following Islam and Christianity in Kerala is about <span>45 per</span> cent; for India as a whole, it is <span>16.5 per</span> cent. The state is home to one of the oldest branches of Christianity. Further, the strategic location along the Arabian Sea facilitated interactions with traders worldwide, including Arabs, Europeans and others. The local rulers were generally tolerant of diverse religious practices.</p>
<p>Many economists in Kerala who noted the difference did not think there was much reason to celebrate. Some said that the record on healthcare and education hid a profound inequality from view. Others <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0161893804000481" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> the low and stagnant income pushed the state’s fiscals into bankruptcy, making the model unsustainable without active markets driving investment and income growth. By the 1990s, the model’s limitations became apparent as the state struggled with low economic growth and financial strains.</p>
<p>If the situation did not lead to a severe crisis, this was due to inward remittances. The state had a long history of labour migration, with significant numbers of people moving to the rest of India and the Persian Gulf states for work. This migration led to substantial remittances, which sustained private consumption, income and investment. By 2010, the excitement over the Kerala Model was dead, and incomes started forging ahead.</p>
<p>The Left changed their focus from land and educational reforms to private investment and decentralisation</p>
<p>The economists (above) who joined the developmental debate took Kerala’s income poverty for granted. They neither saw the income growth coming nor were prepared to explain it. Some Left-leaning economists <a href="https://www.theindiaforum.in/article/achievements-challenges-kerala-model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attributed</a> the resurgence in per-capita income to education and healthcare. But this is not persuasive. A surge in economic growth everywhere and at all times implies rising investment in productive capital, and basic education and healthcare would not deliver that.</p>
<p>The Indian economy in the 2000s saw robust investment and economic growth. But Kerala was not a major destination for mobile private capital. The forging ahead owed to more specific factors, some more peculiar and powerful than those driving India’s transformation.</p>
<p>Here, we must return to Kerala’s historical engagement with the world economy, its natural resources, its literate workforce and its distinctive political landscape. In different ways, all these reinforced private investment. Deep connections with the global economy were pivotal to the recent history of labour migration. While migration created a flow of remittances into consumption, another significant flow went into investment, especially in service sector enterprises in healthcare, education, hospitality and tourism. The state’s temperate semi-equatorial climate, mountainous topography and abundant water resources supported plantations and natural-resource extraction and processing industries for centuries. Some declined in the mid-20th century, but investment in these activities revived later.</p>
<p>The communist movement in Kerala began in the 1930s with the formation of the Congress Socialist Party, driven by peasant and labour movements and anticolonial struggles. The movement joined electoral politics after the formation of the state in 1956, and since then, Left-ruled governments have formed from time to time, almost always with coalition partners. The Leftist political movement in Kerala helped shape the state’s economic policies. In recent years, the Left also changed their focus from land and educational reforms to private investment and decentralisation. Capable local self-government institutions strengthened democratic governance.</p>
<p>In short ways, four forces of change – Kerala’s reintegration with the global economy, remittances from the Persian Gulf, strong welfare policies from a legacy of Leftist government, and private investment from individuals and businesses who shared the remittance flows – have combined to form the structure of Kerala’s miracle of human wellbeing with economic growth.</p>
<p><span>A</span>round 1900, Kerala was a region composed of three political units: the princely states of Travancore and Cochin, and the British Indian district of Malabar. There were a few other smaller princely states as well. There was a broad similarity in the geography across the three units. India’s climatic-ecological map will show that all of Kerala is a semi-equatorial zone with exceptionally heavy monsoon rains, whereas most of India is arid or semi-arid tropical. The region has plentiful water and almost no history of famines, unlike the rest of India.</p>
<p>Geologically, too, Kerala was distinct. The mighty Western Ghats mountain range runs along its eastern borders throughout. Although the southwestern coast offered little scope for agriculture because good land occurred in a narrow strip between the sea and the mountains, the uplands produced goods like black pepper, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon and ginger, which had a ready demand in the world market. Plentiful coconut trees offered scope for coir rope manufacture. The climate was suitable for rubber and tea plantations. The sailing ship construction industry on the western coast obtained timber from the Malabar forests. In the present day, plywood is a major industry.</p>
<p>In the interwar period, poorer and deprived people circulated more</p>
<p>Around 1900, the authorities in all three regions helped foreign capital, which produced or traded in plantation crops like coffee, tea and pepper, and forest-based industries including timber, rayon, coir and rubber. Some of these products were traded globally. These businesses relied heavily on local partners and suppliers, which led to the accumulation of wealth in the hands of groups like the Syrian Christians.</p>
<p>Some of this wealth was invested in small-scale plantations and urban businesses, which encouraged the local migration of agricultural labourers. In the interwar period, poorer and deprived people circulated more. They sought work outside traditional channels like agricultural labour where they had been at the beck and call of upper castes or caste Hindus. At the same time, protestant missions, social reformers and Leftist political movements became active in ameliorating their conditions. These forces led to a significant focus on mass education. The princely states stepped into mass education late but with greater resources on average than a British Indian district. Their investment reinforced the great strides in health and education that made Kerala different.</p>
<p><span>N</span>ine years after India gained independence, Malabar merged with Cochin and Travancore to form the Kerala state. At that time, the livelihoods in the region, like the rest of the country, were based on agriculture. However, a much larger proportion (half or more) of the domestic product was urban and non-agricultural, compared with India as a whole. Nearly <span>40 per </span>cent of the workforce was employed in industry, trade, commerce and finance, compared with <span>20-35 per</span> cent in the larger states in India.</p>
<p>One reason for this was the scarcity of farmlands. The state’s mountainous geography made good land extremely scarce. The exceptionally high population density in the areas of intensive paddy cultivation ensured a level of available land per head (0.<span>6 acres)</span> that was a fraction of the Indian average (3<span>.1 acres</span>) around 1970, and low by any benchmark. Paddy yield was high in these areas. Still, with the low size of landholding, most farmers were families of small resources.</p>
<p>Urban businesses processing abundant natural resources were another story. Some of these businesses were small, non-mechanised factories processing commercial products like coir in Alappuzha (Alleppey) and cashew in Kollam (Quilon). Some areas, such as Aluva (Alwaye), had larger, mechanised factories producing textiles, fertilisers, aluminium, glass and rayon. The region also had tea estates in the hills, and rubber and spice plantations east of Kottayam. Kerala today is a leading region in Indian financial entrepreneurship. Businesses from the region established banks, deposit companies and companies supplying gold-backed loans, which have a presence throughout India. Several of these companies emerged in the interwar period to finance trading and the production of exportable crops.</p>
<p>Thrissur (Trichur) and Kottayam were service-based cities with a concentration of banks, colleges and wealthy churches. Most local businesses were small-scale, semi-rural and household enterprises. Foreign multinationals owned tea estates and export trading firms at the apex of the spectrum of firms. Nearly everything else – from banks to small plantations, trading firms, agencies, transport and most small-scale industries – were Indian-owned family businesses.</p>
<p>Before statehood began in 1956, a powerful communist movement had emerged</p>
<p>From this base, the two decades after 1956 saw a retreat of private investment from industry and agriculture. Partly because of adverse political pressure, the foreign firms left the businesses, and plantations changed ownership. A militant trade union movement rose in the coir- and cashew-processing industries, and most firms, being relatively small, could not withstand the pressure to raise wages. Some shifted operations across the border with Tamil Nadu, where the state did not protect trade unions and labour costs were cheaper. With the central government’s heavy repression of private financial firms and the retreat of private banks, the synergy between industry, banking and commerce was broken. Private capital retreated from industrial production and trading. Following the socialist trend present in India in the 1960s, Kerala state invested in government-owned industries, which were inefficiently managed and ran heavy losses, usually resulting in negative economic contributions.</p>
<p>Private investment in agriculture declined, too. The Left political movement, which was concentrated in agriculture, was again partly responsible. Before statehood began in 1956, a powerful communist movement had emerged. The movement’s leaders understood that inequality in this part of India was not based on class alone. The agricultural countryside was characterised by inequality between the landholders and landless workers, which was only partly based on landownership but also drew strength from oppression and deprivation of lower castes by upper castes.</p>
<p>A narrow strip of highly fertile rice-growing plains in the central part of the state was the original home of Leftist politics. From the 1940s, it was a political battleground. The Leftist political parties organised the poorest tenants and workers into unions. Class-based movements to get higher wages, better employment terms or more land merged with movements to achieve equal social status. The agricultural labourers came from the depressed castes so they were interested in both class and <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-india-deludes-itself-that-caste-discrimination-is-dead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caste politics</a>.</p>
<p>When in power for a second time (from 1967), the communists ruling in coalition delivered on a promise made long ago: radical land reform. The policy involved taking over private land above a ceiling, redistributing it to landless workers, and bringing them under trade unions. The policy was successful in the extent of land redistributed (compared with most states that followed a similar policy) and in sharply raising wages. However, it did have a damaging effect on investment.</p>
<p>Many employers migrated to the Persian Gulf, leaving their land unattended</p>
<p>From the 1970s, private investment withdrew from agriculture. The cultivation of tree crops held steady, if on a low key. But cultivation of seasonal field crops, especially paddy for which the lowlands and the river basins were especially suitable, fell throughout the 1980s. By 1990, traditional agriculture was reduced to an insignificant employer and earner, and for most people still engaged in it, the land provided no more than a subsidiary income. A relative retreat from traditional agriculture is not unique to Kerala, it happened all over India. But in Kerala, the fall was spectacular.</p>
<p>In this densely populated area, the average landholding was small. Most landholders were middle-class people and not particularly rich. The policy squeezed their resources. Investment and acreage cropped fell. Those who remained tied to land did so because they had nowhere to go or worked the land mainly with family labour. The first Green Revolution unfolded in the rest of India, including Tamil Nadu, and had little impact on the state. Many employers migrated to the Persian Gulf in the late-1970s or ’80s, leaving their homesteads and the land unattended. What made all this anomalous was the high unemployment rate in the countryside, possibly the highest in the country. How were high wages and the retreat of a significant livelihood possible in this condition?</p>
<p>The answer is Gulf remittance. Hundreds of thousands of people migrated to the <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/are-the-persian-gulf-city-states-slave-societies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Persian Gulf</a> states like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Qatar to work in construction, retail and services, sectors that saw a massive investment boom following the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979. As they did, the money from the Gulf flowed into construction, retail trade, transport, cinema halls, restaurants and shops in Kerala. An emerging service sector labour market <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/011719680401300405?journalCode=amja" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">absorbed</a> the effort of those who had been made redundant in agriculture or did not want to work there anymore.</p>
<p>What drove emigration to the Gulf? And why did Kerala lead the emigration of Indians to the Gulf? One answer is that the region had for centuries deeper ties with West Asia than any other part of India. Also, high unemployment pushed skilled individuals to seek work outside the state. Kerala, for at least three decades (1975-2005), supplied a significant share of the workers who moved to these labour markets. The demand for skilled workers increased as the Gulf economies diversified from oil-based jobs to finance and business services. While offering jobs in the millions, the migration also had a series of broad effects back home on occupational diversification, skill accumulation, changing gender roles, consumption, economic and social mobility, and demographic transitions.</p>
<p><span>I</span>n the 1990s, the Indian economy liberalised, reducing protectionist tariffs and restrictions on foreign and domestic private investment. In the following decades, increased private investment led to generally elevated economic growth rates. At the same time, the political culture shifted away from emphasis on socialist ideas, becoming more market-friendly than before. Kerala was not untouched by these tendencies, but its specificities – natural resource abundance, Leftist legacy, migration history – joined the pan-Indian trend distinctly. There were three prominent elements in the story.</p>
<p>First, a demographic transition completed by 1990, when population growth decreased substantially. The fall in population growth rate was not unique to the state but aligned with broader Indian trends. However, the levels differed. Of all states in India, Kerala was <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4396712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ageing</a> much faster than the rest and from earlier times.</p>
<p>Second, politics changed. Again, the legacy of Left rule was an important factor behind the shift. A communist alliance won the first state assembly elections in 1957, lost in 1960, returned to power and ruled the state in <span>1967-70</span> (with breaks), <span>1970-77,</span> <span>1978-79,</span> <span>1980-82,</span> <span>1987-91,</span> <span>1996-2001,</span> <span>2006-11,</span> and since 2016. The composition of the Left coalition changed multiple times, never consisting only of ideologically Left parties. It included, for example, the Muslim League and some Christian factions allied with the communists. However, until 1964, the main constituent of the coalition was the Communist Party of India (CPI), called CPI (Marxist), or CPI (M), after 1964. In no other state in India, except West Bengal (and later Tripura), did the CPI/CPI (M) command a popular support base large enough to win elections.</p>
<p>The Left turned friendly towards private capital and shed the rhetoric of class struggle</p>
<p>The Left Democratic Front, which had ruled Kerala in different years, returned to power in 2016 and has been in power since then. In the 2000s, the Leftists quietly reinvented themselves. They needed to because the older agenda was almost dead. In elections in the 1960s and ’70s, agricultural labourers in this land-poor state formed the main support base for communist victories based on the promise of land reforms. Caste-equality social reform movements coalesced around the Leftist movement. After the Leftists delivered land reforms, there was not much of an agenda.</p>
<p>From 2000, the Left turned friendly towards private capital and shed the rhetoric of class struggle. In practical terms, the state retreated from regulating private capital and strengthening trade unions, and focused on infrastructure investment to strengthen small businesses. The reinvention was a success and delivered election victories. As the private sector took charge of investment in education and healthcare, the state could afford to focus on decentralised governance, corruption-free administration, improved public services and urban infrastructure. The class-based politics of the 1960s and ’70s died. With private investment rising, the state had more capacity to fund welfare schemes and public administration. Tourism promotion is an excellent example of a new form of synergy: the state builds roads, private capital builds hotels, and lakes and mountains supply the landscape.</p>
<p>Third, investment in Kerala revived. Over the past three decades, the private sector has increasingly driven education and healthcare. Since 1990, many new types of small-scale businesses have flourished in the state. There is no single story of where the money came from and what these enterprises add to employment potential. We know much of it happened on the back of natural-resource processing. In all fields, value was added by accessing niche export markets, using new technologies, and forming many micro, medium and small enterprises. The state has one of the highest concentrations of startups. Natural resource extraction does not mean any more plantations packaging harvested spices but the extraction of nutraceuticals. Jewellery manufacture involves invention and experimentation with designs. Rubber products diversified from automotive tyres to surgical accessories.</p>
<p>Although foreign investment inflow, which supported business development in the princely areas, was revived via the Gulf route, most of the business development is concentrated in non-corporate family firms. Few raise significant equity capital or are publicly held. Most service sector enterprises in tourism, trade, transport, banking and real estate are relatively small. Family business remains a strong organisational model. Little research exists on the externalities that these businesses generate. The one large exception to this rule is investment in IT clusters near the big cities.</p>
<p><span>L</span>et us start with a restatement of the main points of the story. Not long ago, Kerala was celebrated for its exceptional human development indices in education and healthcare, with many scholars attributing this to an enlightened political ideology and communist influence. These advances also resulted from factors like the princely states’ higher fiscal capacity, favourable environmental conditions, and a globally connected capitalism. During the 1970s and ’80s, government interventions weakened market activity and growth, making human development look even more striking than otherwise. Since previous commitments to social infrastructure were maintained, the state was heading toward a fiscal crisis.</p>
<p>In the 2000s, an economic revival came through mass migration and remittances, initially supporting consumption and construction. At the same time, a wealthier and technically skilled diaspora invested in the state, in services and manufacturing. New sectors like tourism, hotels, spice extracts, ayurvedic products, rubber products and information technology drove this revival. Remittances also flowed into new forms of consumption. The urban landscape transformed, with towns developing shopping malls, restaurants and modern businesses. While earlier regimes discouraged private investment, now there is a symbiosis between the private sector and the state, as market activity supports public welfare commitments.</p>
<p>The New Left, unlike the Old Left, is open to private capital and acknowledges the importance of the market, including the global market. Without compromising welfare expenditure, the state has expanded the hitherto neglected infrastructure projects, crowding in private investments. This is the second turnaround in the development trajectories of the state. The first turnaround happened during the early 1980s fuelled by remittance money. The second turnaround happened in the 2010s, when social growth, always Kerala’s strength, joined unprecedented levels of capital expenditure. If both the Left and non-Left political parties could take credit for the first turnaround, the credit for the second one should rest with the New Left.</p>
<p>Recent climate change and overdevelopment have increased disaster risks</p>
<p>Looking forward, the pathway of recent economic change has both strengths and challenges. The strengths include the generally high quality of life in small towns, improved youth aspirations often marked by an increased flow to foreign universities, better worker safety, the ability to attract skilled and unskilled migrants, unique natural-resource advantages and a degree of sociability in relations between castes and religions. The challenges are poor higher education quality, environmental threats from new forms of tourism infrastructure and climate change, a rapidly ageing population, and the possibility of a fiscal crisis.</p>
<p>Some of these challenges are enormous, and are already straining the budget and state capacity. Land reforms brought some equality, but the absence of follow-up actions prevented productivity improvements. Kerala produces less than <span>15 per</span> cent of its food requirements, and relies heavily on central supplies and neighbouring states. To respond to this problem, the government has strengthened its public distribution system. That, along with the care of the elderly and scaling up of public services, particularly education and health, will place enormous burdens on the state’s public finances in the near future.</p>
<p>Historically, the state’s unique climate with abundant rainfall provided natural advantages, supporting high life expectancy and diverse agricultural opportunities. However, recent climate change and overdevelopment have increased disaster risks. The environmental transformation has been primarily driven by private construction, especially Gulf-funded developments in dwellings, hotels and service sectors. Land has become the single most speculative asset of the real-estate lobbyists. Extensive economic activities in ecologically sensitive regions, possibly accompanying tourism development with its tagline of ‘God’s own country’, allegedly led to landslides, soil erosion and environmental vulnerabilities. In recent years, an accent on ‘responsible tourism’ has tried to reduce the potential risks.</p>
<p>There is more. Human-wildlife conflicts and soil erosion have increased, and declining rainfall poses significant challenges. The devastating floods in 2018 and the near-disaster in 2019 highlighted the consequences of excessive construction and poor environmental management. The state now has one of India’s highest levels of consumption inequality. The quality of higher and technical education remains poor, contributing to educated unemployment.</p>
<p>The state’s future success will depend on balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability, improving the quality of education, improving the employability of graduates, and social equity. It is a complicated task precisely because so much of the recent growth owes to exploiting the environment. There is a real prospect of worsening inequality along caste, class, gender and age lines if the current pattern of growth slows. On the other hand, recent advancements in the digital and knowledge economy, combined with sustainable infrastructure, open fresh spaces for egalitarian development. Still, the future is hard to predict because the regional economy is deeply dependent on integration with the world economy and the ever-changing ideological alliances.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Disk I/O bottlenecks are easy to overlook when analyzing CI pipeline performance, but tools like <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/iostat">iostat</a> and <a href="https://github.com/axboe/fio">fio</a> can help shed a light on what might be slowing down your pipelines more than you know.</p>
<p>GitHub offers different hosted-runners with a range of specs, but for this test we are using the default <code>ubuntu-22.04</code> runner in a private repository, which does give us an additional 2 vCPUs but does not alter the disk performance.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-monitor-disk-performance">How to monitor disk performance</h2>
<p>Getting a baseline benchmark from a tool like <code>fio</code> is useful for comparing the relative disk performance of different runners. However, to investigate if you are hitting disk I/O bottlenecks in your CI pipeline, it is more useful to monitor disk performance during the pipeline execution.</p>
<p>We can use a tool like <code>iostat</code> to monitor the disk while installing dependencies from the cache to see how much we are saturating the disk.</p>

<h3 id="monitoring-disk-during-untar-of-nextjs-dependencies">Monitoring disk during untar of Next.js dependencies</h3>
<p>In the above test, we used <code>iostat</code> to monitor disk performance while the cache action downloaded and untarred the dependencies for <code>vercel/next.js</code>:</p>

<span><span>Cache</span><span> restored</span><span> successfully</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The full step took 12s to complete, and we can estimate the download took around 3s, leaving 9s for the untar operation.</p>
<p>The compressed tarball is only about 328MB, but after extraction, the total amount of data written to the disk is about 1.6GB. That smaller size got our cache across the network plenty fast, and most CPUs can handle decompression fast enough, meaning higher compression is often favorable. Once download and decompression are no longer the bottleneck, that leaves writing to disk.</p>
<p>Reading from a tarball is a fairly efficient process as it's mostly sequential reads, however, we then need to write each file to disk. This is where we can hit disk I/O bottlenecks, especially with a large number of small files.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that this is just a single run, not an average. Running multiple tests over time will give you a much clearer picture of the overall performance. Variance between runs can be quite high, so an individual bad run doesn’t necessarily indicate a problem.</p>
<p>What this run suggests is a possible throughput bottleneck. We’re seeing spikes in the maximum total throughput, with most hovering around ~220MB/s. This is likely the maximum throughput we are able to achieve to this disk, we'll verify this next. We should continue to monitor this and compare it to other runners to see if we can find an ideal runner for our workflow. We'll use <code>fio</code> to double-check if we are hitting the disk's maximum throughput.</p>
<p>An interesting aside before we move on, we can see from this side-by-side how relatively low read operations to writes there are. Since we’re reading from a tarball, most reads are sequential, which tends to be more efficient. That read data is likely going into a buffer before being written to the disk in a more random pattern as it creates a copy of each file. This is why we see a higher write IOPS than read IOPS.</p>
<h3 id="maximum-disk-throughput">Maximum disk throughput</h3>
<p>One of the first optimizations developers usually make to their CI pipelines is caching dependencies. Even though the cache still gets uploaded and downloaded with each run, it speeds things up by packaging all your dependencies into one compressed file. This skips the hassle of resolving dependencies, avoids multiple potentially slow downloads, and cuts down on network delays.</p>
<p>But as we saw above, network speed isn't usually our bottleneck when downloading the cache.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Test Type</th><th>Block Size</th><th>Bandwidth</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Read Throughput</strong></td><td>1024KiB</td><td>~209MB/s</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Write Throughput</strong></td><td>1024KiB</td><td>~209MB/s</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Using <code>fio</code> to test our throughput, notice that both "read" and "write" throughput are both capped at the same value. This is a fairly telling sign that the limitation here is not actually the disk physically, but rather a bandwidth limit imposed by GitHub. This is a standard practice to divide up resources among multiple users who may be accessing the same physical disk from their virtual machines. It isn't always documented, but most providers will have higher bandwidth limits on higher tier runners.</p>
<p>What we measured here aligns fairly closely with the 220MB/s we saw in the untar test, giving us another hint that we are likely being slowed down during our dependency installation, not by the network or CPU, but by the disk.</p>
<p>Regardless of how fast our download speed is, we won't be able to write to disk any faster than our max throughput to the disk.</p>
<div><div><p><label for="cache-size">Uncompressed Cache Size</label></p><p><label for="bandwidth-limit">Disk Bandwidth</label></p></div><p><span>Estimated time to write to disk:<!-- --> </span><span>Select a cache payload and throughput speed</span></p></div>
<p>Realistically, your disk performance will vary greatly depending on your specific cache size, the number of files, and just general build-to-build variance. That's why it's a good idea to monitor your CI runners for a consistent baseline, and we'll talk about testing your workflow on multiple runners for comparison.</p>
<h3 id="maximum-iops-inputoutput-operations-per-second">Maximum IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)</h3>
<p>After downloading the cache tarball, it needs to be extracted. Depending on the compression level it could be a CPU-intensive operation but this isn't usually a problem. When untar-ing the dependencies, we are performing a lot of small read and write operations, which is where we can hit disk I/O bottlenecks.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Test Type</th><th>Block Size</th><th>IOPS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Read IOPS</strong></td><td>4096B</td><td>~51K</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Write IOPS</strong></td><td>4096B</td><td>~57K</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Random Read IOPS</strong></td><td>4096B</td><td>~9370</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Random Write IOPS</strong></td><td>4096B</td><td>~3290</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>IOPS is a measure of how many read/write operations can be performed in a second. When we have a lot of small files, like especially with a <code>node_modules</code> directory, it is possible to saturate the IOPS limit of the disk (or the imposed limit) and become a different kind of IO bottleneck.</p>
<p>Similarly to how we can't write to the disk any faster than the bandwidth limit, there is a limit to how many IOPS we can perform on the disk.</p>
<h2 id="running-benchmarks-on-different-runners">Running benchmarks on different runners</h2>
<p>If you are seeing bottlenecks in your CI pipeline, of any kind, we want to try to optimize for those issues with strategies like caching and parallelizing where possible. But we also need to know if we are hitting the limits of the runner we are using. It's easy enough to add a matrix strategy to your workflow to test on multiple runners for a quick comparison of speed of the same steps on different hardware.</p>

<p>To get a more detailed look at the specific disk performance of each runner, you can use the <code>fio</code> benchmarking tool we mentioned earlier. This will give you a better idea of the disk performance of each runner, and a reference point for checking for bottlenecks in your CI pipeline.</p>

Furthermore, we never could reconstruct our proof, so our assertion now can be called only a conjecture”.

However, I was not able to adjust parameters to reach <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%28300000%29+%5Cgeq+100000%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%28300000%29+%5Cgeq+100000%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%28300000%29+%5Cgeq+100000%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{t(300000) \geq 100000}"> in this manner. Perhaps some readers here who are adept with computers can come up with a more efficient construction to get closer to this bound? If one can find a way to reach this bound, most likely it can be adapted to then resolve conjectures (ii) and (iii) above after some additional numerical effort.
