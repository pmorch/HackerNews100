        <p>Have you ever asked yourself what if we could replace any message broker with a very simple one using only two UNIX signals? Well, I‚Äôm not surprised if you didn‚Äôt. But I did. And I want to share my journey of how I achieved it.</p>
<p>If you want to learn about UNIX signals, binary operations the easy way, how a message broker works under the hood, and a bit of Ruby, this post is for you.</p>
<p>And if you came here just because of the clickbait title, I apologize and invite you to keep reading. It‚Äôll be fun, I promise.</p>

<h2>It‚Äôs all about UNIX</h2>
<p>A few days ago, I saw some discussion on the internet about how we could send messages between processes. Many people think of sockets, which are the most common way to send messages, even allowing communication across different machines and networks. Some don‚Äôt even realize that pipes are another way to send messages between processes:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p><span>$</span> <span>echo</span> <span>'hello'</span> <span>|</span> <span>base64</span>
</p><p><span>aGVsbG8K</span>
</p></code></pre>
<p>Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening:</p>
<ul>
<li>The process <code>echo</code> is started with the content ‚Äúhello‚Äù</li>
<li><code>echo</code> is a program that prints the message to <em>STDOUT</em></li>
<li>Through the pipe, the content in <em>STDOUT</em> is <strong>sent</strong> directly to the <em>STDIN</em> of the <code>base64</code> process</li>
<li>The <code>base64</code> process encodes its input to Base64 and then puts the result in <em>STDOUT</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Note the word ‚Äúsend‚Äù. Yes, anonymous pipes are a form of <strong>IPC (Inter-process communication).</strong> Other forms of IPC in UNIX include:</p>
<ul>
<li>named pipes (mkfifo)</li>
<li>sockets</li>
<li>regular files</li>
<li>or even a simple <strong>signal</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>UNIX signals</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://leandronsp.com/articles/url">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A UNIX signal is a standardized message sent to a program to trigger specific behaviour, such as quitting or error handling</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many signals we can send to a process, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>SIGTERM - sends a notification to the process to terminate. It can be ‚Äútrapped,‚Äù which means the process can do some cleanup work before termination, like releasing OS resources and closing file descriptors</li>
<li>SIGKILL - sends a termination signal that cannot be trapped or ignored, forcing immediate termination</li>
<li>SIGINT - the interrupt signal, typically sent when you press <code>Ctrl+C</code> in the terminal. It can be trapped, allowing the process to perform cleanup before exiting gracefully</li>
<li>SIGHUP - the hangup signal, originally sent when a terminal connection was lost. Modern applications often use it to reload configuration files without restarting the process</li>
<li>SIGQUIT - similar to SIGINT but also generates a core dump for debugging</li>
<li>SIGSTOP - pauses (suspends) a process. Cannot be trapped or ignored</li>
<li>SIGCONT - resumes a process that was paused by <em>SIGSTOP</em></li>
<li>SIGCHLD - sent to a parent process when a child process terminates or stops</li>
<li><strong>SIGUSR1</strong> and <strong>SIGUSR2</strong> - user-defined signals that applications can use for custom purposes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sending messages using  signals</h2>
<p>Okay, we know that signals are a primitive form of IPC. UNIX-like systems provide a syscall called <code>kill</code> that sends signals to processes. Historically, this syscall was created solely to terminate processes. But over time, they needed to accommodate other types of signals, so they reused the same syscall for different purposes.</p>
<p>For instance, let‚Äôs create a simple Ruby script <code>sleeper.rb</code> which sleeps for 60 seconds, nothing more:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p><span>puts</span> <span>"</span><span>Process ID: </span><span>#{</span><span>Process</span><span>.</span><span>pid</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
</p><p><span>puts</span> <span>"</span><span>Sleeping for 60 seconds...</span><span>"</span>
</p><p><span>sleep</span> <span>60</span>
</p></code></pre>
<p>After running we see:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p>Process ID: 55402
</p><p>Sleeping for 60 seconds...
</p></code></pre>
<p>In another window, we can <strong>send</strong> the <code>SIGTERM</code> signal to the process <code>55402</code> via syscall <code>kill</code>:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p><span>$</span> <span>kill</span> <span>-SIGTERM</span> <span>55402</span>
</p></code></pre>
<p>And then, in the script session:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p>[1]    55402 terminated  ruby sleeper.rb
</p></code></pre>
<h3>Signal traps</h3>
<p>In Ruby, we can also <em>trap</em> a signal using the <code>trap</code> method in Ruby:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p><span>puts</span> <span>"</span><span>Process ID: </span><span>#{</span><span>Process</span><span>.</span><span>pid</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
</p><p><span>puts</span> <span>"</span><span>Sleeping for 60 seconds...</span><span>"</span>
</p><p><span>trap</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>SIGTERM</span><span>'</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> 
</p><p><span>puts</span> <span>"</span><span>Received SIGTERM, exiting gracefully...</span><span>"</span>
</p><p><span>exit</span>
</p><p><span>end</span>
</p><p><span>sleep</span> <span>60</span>
</p></code></pre>
<p>Which in turn, after sending the signal, will gracefully:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p>Process ID: 55536
</p><p>Sleeping for 60 seconds...
</p><p>Received SIGTERM, exiting gracefully...
</p></code></pre>
<p>After all, we <em>cannot send messages using signals</em>. They are a primitive way of sending <em>standardized messages</em> which will trigger specific behaviours. At most, we can trap some signals, but nothing more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay Leandro, but what‚Äôs the purpose of this article then?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Hold on</em>. That‚Äôs exactly why I‚Äôm here. To prove points by doing useless stuff, like when I <a href="https://leandronsp.com/articles/simulating-oop-in-bash-3mop">simulated OOP in Bash</a> a couple of years ago (it was fun though).</p>
<p>To understand how we can ‚Äúhack‚Äù UNIX signals and send messages between processes, let‚Äôs first talk a bit about <strong>binary operations</strong>. Yes, those ‚Äúzeros‚Äù and ‚Äúones‚Äù you were scared of when you saw them for the first time. But they don‚Äôt bite (ü•Å LOL), I promise.</p>
<h2>What is a message?</h2>
<p>If we model a message as a sequence of characters, we could say that at a high-level, messages are simply <em>strings</em>. But in memory, they are stored as <strong>bytes</strong>.</p>
<p>We know that bytes are made of bits. In computer terms, what‚Äôs a bit? It‚Äôs simply an abstraction representing <strong>only two states</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>zero</li>
<li>one</li>
</ul>
<p>That‚Äôs it. For instance, using <a href="https://leandronsp.com/articles/url">ASCII</a>, we know that the letter ‚Äúh‚Äù has the following codes:</p>
<ul>
<li>104 in decimal</li>
<li><code>0x68</code> in hexadecimal</li>
<li><code>01101000</code> in binary</li>
</ul>
<p>Binary-wise, what if we represented each ‚Äú0‚Äù with a specific signal and each ‚Äú1‚Äù with another? We know that some signals such as SIGTERM, SIGINT, and SIGCONT can be trapped, but intercepting them would harm their original purpose.</p>
<p>But thankfully, UNIX provides two user-defined signals that are perfect for our hacking experiment.</p>
<h2>Sending SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2</h2>
<p>First things first, let‚Äôs trap those signals in the code:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p><span>puts</span> <span>"</span><span>Process ID: </span><span>#{</span><span>Process</span><span>.</span><span>pid</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
</p><p><span>puts</span> <span>"</span><span>Sleeping forever. Send signals to this process to see how it responds.</span><span>"</span>
</p><p><span>trap</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>SIGUSR1</span><span>'</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> 
</p><p><span>puts</span> <span>"</span><span>Received SIGUSR1 signal</span><span>"</span>
</p><p><span>end</span>
</p><p><span>trap</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>SIGUSR2</span><span>'</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
</p><p><span>puts</span> <span>"</span><span>Received SIGUSR2 signal</span><span>"</span>
</p><p><span>end</span>
</p><p><span>sleep</span>
</p></code></pre>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p>Process ID: 56172
</p><p>Sleeping forever. Send signals to this process to see how it responds.
</p></code></pre>
<p>After sending some <code>kill -SIGUSR1 56172</code> and <code>kill -SIGUSR2 56172</code>, we can see that the process prints the following content:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p>Process ID: 56172
</p><p>Sleeping forever. Send signals to this process to see how it responds.
</p><p>Received SIGUSR1 signal
</p><p>Received SIGUSR2 signal
</p><p>Received SIGUSR2 signal
</p><p>Received SIGUSR1 signal
</p><p>Received SIGUSR1 signal
</p><p>Received SIGUSR2 signal
</p></code></pre>
<p><strong>Signals don‚Äôt carry data</strong>. But the example we have is perfect for changing to bits, uh?</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p>Received SIGUSR1 signal # 0
</p><p>Received SIGUSR2 signal # 1
</p><p>Received SIGUSR2 signal # 1
</p><p>Received SIGUSR1 signal # 0
</p><p>Received SIGUSR2 signal # 1
</p><p>Received SIGUSR1 signal # 0
</p><p>Received SIGUSR1 signal # 0
</p><p>Received SIGUSR1 signal # 0
</p></code></pre>
<p>That‚Äôs exactly <code>01101000</code>, the binary representation of the letter ‚Äúh‚Äù. We‚Äôre simply <strong>encoding</strong> the letter as a binary representation and sending it via signals</p>
<p>Again, we‚Äôre <strong>encoding it as a binary</strong> and sending it <strong>via signals</strong>.</p>
<p><em>How cool is that</em>?</p>
<p><img src="https://leandronsp.com/uploads/3299.png" alt="image"></p>
<h3>Decoding the binary data</h3>
<p>On the other side, the receiver should be capable of decoding the message and converting it back to the letter ‚Äúh‚Äù:</p>
<ul>
<li>sender <em>encodes</em> the message</li>
<li>receiver <em>decodes</em> the message</li>
</ul>
<p>So, how do we decode <code>01101000</code> (the letter ‚Äúh‚Äù in ASCII)? Let‚Äôs break it down into a few steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, we need to see the 8 bits as individual digits in their respective positions</li>
<li>The rightmost bit is at position 0, whereas the leftmost bit is at position 7. This is how we define the most significant bit (<strong>MSB</strong>, the leftmost) and the least significant bit (<strong>LSB</strong>, the rightmost)</li>
<li>For this example, we perform a <strong>left shift</strong> operation on each bit and then sum all the values, in this case from MSB to LSB (the order doesn‚Äôt matter much for now): <code>(0 &lt;&lt; 7) + (1 &lt;&lt; 6) + (1 &lt;&lt; 5) + (0 &lt;&lt; 4) + ... + (0 &lt;&lt; 0)</code>:<br>
<em>left shift on <em>zeros</em> will always produce a <em>zero</em></em></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>0 &lt;&lt; 7</code> = <code>(2 ** 7) * 0</code> = <code>128 * 0</code> = 0</li>
<li><code>1 &lt;&lt; 6</code> = <code>(2 ** 6) * 1</code> = <code>64 * 1</code> = 64</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly to the remaining bits:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>1 &lt;&lt; 5</code> = 32</li>
<li><code>0 &lt;&lt; 4</code> = 0</li>
<li><code>1 &lt;&lt; 3</code> = 8</li>
<li><code>0 &lt;&lt; 2</code> = 0</li>
<li><code>0 &lt;&lt; 1</code> = 0</li>
<li><code>0 &lt;&lt; 0</code> = 0</li>
</ul>
<p>So, our sum becomes, from MSB to LSB:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p>MSB                          LSB
</p><p>0   1    1    0   1   0   0   0
</p><p>0 + 64 + 32 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 104
</p></code></pre>
<p>104 is exactly the <strong>decimal representation</strong> of the letter ‚Äúh‚Äù in ASCII.</p>
<p><em>How wonderful is that?</em></p>
<h3>Sending the letter ‚Äúh‚Äù</h3>
<p>Now let‚Äôs convert these operations to Ruby code. We‚Äôll write a simple program <code>receiver.rb</code> that receives signals in order from LSB to MSB (positions 0 to 7) and then converts them back to ASCII characters, printing to <code>STDOUT</code>.</p>
<p>Basically, we‚Äôll <strong>accumulate</strong> bits and whenever we form a complete byte, we‚Äôll decode it to its ASCII representation. The very basic implementation of our <code>accumulate_bit(bit)</code> method would look like as follows:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p><span>@position</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span> <span># start with the LSB</span>
</p><p><span>@accumulator</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
</p><p><span>def</span> <span>accumulate_bit</span><span>(</span><span>bit</span><span>)</span>
</p><p><span># The left shift operator (&lt;&lt;) is used to </span>
</p><p><span># shift the bits of the number to the left.</span>
</p><p><span>#</span>
</p><p><span># This is equivalent of: (2 ** @position) * bit</span>
</p><p><span>@accumulator</span> <span>+=</span> <span>(</span><span>bit</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>@position</span><span>)</span>
</p><p><span>return</span> <span>@accumulator</span> <span>if</span> <span>@position</span> <span>==</span> <span>7</span> <span># stop accumulating after 8 bits (byte)</span>
</p><p><span>@position</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span> <span># move to the next bit position: 0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 2, etc.</span>
</p><p><span>end</span>
</p><p><span># Letter "h" in binary is 01101000</span>
</p><p><span># But we'll send from the LSB to the MSB</span>
</p><p><span>#</span>
</p><p><span># 0110 1000 (MSB -&gt; LSB) becomes 0001 0110 (LSB -&gt; MSB)</span>
</p><p><span># The order doesn't matter that much, it'll depend on </span>
</p><p><span># the receiver's implementation.</span>
</p><p><span>accumulate_bit</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
</p><p><span>accumulate_bit</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
</p><p><span>accumulate_bit</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
</p><p><span>accumulate_bit</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
</p><p><span>accumulate_bit</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
</p><p><span>accumulate_bit</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
</p><p><span>accumulate_bit</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
</p><p><span>accumulate_bit</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
</p><p><span>puts</span> <span>@accumulator</span> <span># should print 104, which is the ASCII code for "h"</span>
</p></code></pre>
<p><em>Pay attention to this code. It‚Äôs very important and builds the foundation for the next steps. If you didn‚Äôt get it, go back and read it again. Try it yourself in the terminal or using your preferred programming language.</em></p>
<p>Now, how to convert the decimal <code>104</code> to the ASCII character representation? Luckily, Ruby provides a method called <code>chr</code> which does the job:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p><span>irb</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>puts</span> <span>104</span><span>.</span><span>chr</span>
</p><p><span>=&gt;</span> <span>"</span><span>h</span><span>"</span>
</p></code></pre>
<p>We could do the same job for the rest of the word ‚Äúhello‚Äù, for instance. According to the <a href="https://www.ascii-code.com/">ASCII table</a>, it should be the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>e</code> in decimal is <code>101</code></li>
<li><code>l</code> in decimal is <code>108</code></li>
<li><code>o</code> in decimal is <code>111</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Let‚Äôs check if Ruby knows that:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p><span>104</span><span>.</span><span>chr</span>    <span># "h"</span>
</p><p><span>101</span><span>.</span><span>chr</span>    <span># "e"</span>
</p><p><span>108</span><span>.</span><span>chr</span>    <span># "l"</span>
</p><p><span>111</span><span>.</span><span>chr</span>    <span># "o"</span>
</p></code></pre>
<p>We can even ‚Äúdecode‚Äù the word to the decimal representation in ASCII:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p><span>irb</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>"</span><span>hello</span><span>"</span><span>.</span><span>bytes</span>
</p><p><span>=&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>104</span><span>,</span> <span>101</span><span>,</span> <span>108</span><span>,</span> <span>108</span><span>,</span> <span>111</span><span>]</span>
</p></code></pre>
<p>Now, time to finish our receiver implementation to properly print the letter ‚Äúh‚Äù:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p><span>@position</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span> <span># start with the LSB</span>
</p><p><span>@accumulator</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
</p><p><span>trap</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>SIGUSR1</span><span>'</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>decode_signal</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
</p><p><span>trap</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>SIGUSR2</span><span>'</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>decode_signal</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
</p><p><span>def</span> <span>decode_signal</span><span>(</span><span>bit</span><span>)</span>
</p><p><span>accumulate_bit</span><span>(</span><span>bit</span><span>)</span>
</p><p><span>return</span> <span>unless</span> <span>@position</span> <span>==</span> <span>8</span> <span># if not yet accumulated a byte, keep accumulating</span>
</p><p><span>print</span> <span>"</span><span>Received byte: </span><span>#{</span><span>@accumulator</span><span>}</span><span> (</span><span>#{</span><span>@accumulator</span><span>.</span><span>chr</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
</p><p><span>@accumulator</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span> <span># reset the accumulator</span>
</p><p><span>@position</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span> <span># reset position for the next byte</span>
</p><p><span>end</span>
</p><p><span>def</span> <span>accumulate_bit</span><span>(</span><span>bit</span><span>)</span>
</p><p><span># The left shift operator (&lt;&lt;) is used to </span>
</p><p><span># shift the bits of the number to the left.</span>
</p><p><span>#</span>
</p><p><span># This is equivalent of: (2 ** @position) * bit</span>
</p><p><span>@accumulator</span> <span>+=</span> <span>(</span><span>bit</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>@position</span><span>)</span>
</p><p><span>@position</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span> <span># move to the next bit position: 0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 2, etc.</span>
</p><p><span>end</span>
</p><p><span>puts</span> <span>"</span><span>Process ID: </span><span>#{</span><span>Process</span><span>.</span><span>pid</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
</p><p><span>sleep</span>
</p></code></pre>
<p><em>Read that code and its comments. It‚Äôs very important. Do not continue reading until you really get what‚Äôs happening here.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever we get <code>SIGUSR1</code>, we accumulate the bit <code>0</code></li>
<li>When getting <code>SIGUSR2</code>, accumulate then the bit <code>1</code></li>
<li>When accumulator reaches  the position<code>8</code>, it means we have a byte. At this moment we should print the ASCII representation using the <code>.chr</code> we seen earlier. Then, reset bit position and accumulator</li>
</ul>
<p>Let‚Äôs see our receiver in action! Start the receiver in one terminal:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p><span>$</span> <span>ruby</span> <span>receiver.rb</span>
</p><p><span>Process</span> <span>ID:</span> <span>58219</span>
</p></code></pre>
<p>Great! Now the receiver is listening for signals. In another terminal, let‚Äôs manually send signals<br>
to form the letter ‚Äúh‚Äù (which is <code>01101000</code> in binary, remember?):</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p>  # Sending from LSB to MSB: 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0
</p><p>  $ kill -SIGUSR1 58219  # 0
</p><p>  $ kill -SIGUSR1 58219  # 0
</p><p>  $ kill -SIGUSR1 58219  # 0
</p><p>  $ kill -SIGUSR2 58219  # 1
</p><p>  $ kill -SIGUSR1 58219  # 0
</p><p>  $ kill -SIGUSR2 58219  # 1
</p><p>  $ kill -SIGUSR2 58219  # 1
</p><p>  $ kill -SIGUSR1 58219  # 0
</p></code></pre>
<p>And in the receiver terminal, we should see:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p>Received byte: 104 (h)
</p></code></pre>
<p><em>How amazing is that?</em> We just sent the letter ‚Äúh‚Äù using only two UNIX signals!</p>
<p>But wait. Manually sending 8 signals for each character? That‚Äôs tedious and error-prone. What if we wanted to send the word ‚Äúhello‚Äù? That‚Äôs 5 characters √ó 8 bits = 40 signals to send manually. No way.</p>
<p><em>We need a sender.</em></p>
<h3>Building the sender</h3>
<p>The sender‚Äôs job is the opposite of the receiver: it should encode a message (string) into bits and send them as signals to the receiver process.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs think about what we need:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take a message as input (like ‚Äúhello‚Äù)</li>
<li>Convert each character to its byte representation</li>
<li>Extract the 8 bits from each byte</li>
<li>Send <code>SIGUSR1</code> for bit 0, <code>SIGUSR2</code> for bit 1</li>
<li>Repeat for all characters</li>
</ol>
<p>The tricky part here is the step 3: <strong>how do we extract individual bits from a byte?</strong> To extract the bit at position <code>i</code>, we can use the following formula:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p>bit = (byte &gt;&gt; i) &amp; 1
</p></code></pre>
<p>Let me break this down:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>byte &gt;&gt; i</code> performs a <em>right shift</em> by <code>i</code> positions</li>
<li><code>&amp; 1</code> is a bitwise <code>AND</code> operation that extracts only the <em>rightmost</em> bit</li>
</ul>
<p>For the letter ‚Äúh‚Äù (<code>01101000</code> in binary, <code>104</code> in decimal):</p>
<p><strong>Position 0 (LSB):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>(104 &gt;&gt; 0)</code> = <code>104 / (2 ** 0)</code> = <code>104 / 1</code> = 104</li>
<li><code>01101000</code> &gt;&gt; 0 = <code>01101000</code></li>
<li><code>01101000</code> &amp; <code>00000001</code> = 0 (<em>one</em> AND <em>zero</em> is <em>zero</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Position 1:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>(104 &gt;&gt; 1)</code> = <code>104 / (2 ** 1)</code> = <code>104 / 2</code> = 52</li>
<li><code>01101000</code> &gt;&gt; 1 = <code>00110100</code></li>
<li><code>00110100</code> &amp; <code>00000001</code> = 0</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Position 2:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>(104 &gt;&gt; 2)</code> = <code>104 / (2 ** 2)</code> = <code>104 / 4</code> = 26</li>
<li><code>01101000</code> &gt;&gt; 2 = <code>00011010</code></li>
<li><code>00011010</code> &amp; <code>00000001</code> = 0</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Position 3:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>(104 &gt;&gt; 3)</code> = <code>104 / (2 ** 3)</code> = <code>104 / 8</code> = 13</li>
<li><code>01101000</code> &gt;&gt; 3 = <code>00001101</code></li>
<li><code>00001101</code> &amp; <code>00000001</code> = 1 (<em>one</em> AND <em>one</em> equals <em>one</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on for positions 4, 5, 6, and 7. This gives us: <code>0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0</code> ‚Äî exactly the bits we need from LSB to MSB!</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(104 &gt;&gt; 0) &amp; 1</code> = <code>104 &amp; 1</code> = 0</li>
<li><code>(104 &gt;&gt; 1) &amp; 1</code> = <code>52 &amp; 1</code> = 0</li>
<li><code>(104 &gt;&gt; 2) &amp; 1</code> = <code>26 &amp; 1</code> = 0</li>
<li><code>(104 &gt;&gt; 3) &amp; 1</code> = <code>13 &amp; 1</code> = 1</li>
<li><code>(104 &gt;&gt; 4) &amp; 1</code> = <code>6 &amp; 1</code> = 0</li>
<li><code>(104 &gt;&gt; 5) &amp; 1</code> = <code>3 &amp; 1</code> = 1</li>
<li><code>(104 &gt;&gt; 6) &amp; 1</code> = <code>1 &amp; 1</code> = 1</li>
<li><code>(104 &gt;&gt; 7) &amp; 1</code> = <code>0 &amp; 1</code> = 0</li>
</ul>

<p>Pay close attention to this technique. It‚Äôs a fundamental operation in low-level programming.</p>

<p>So now time to build the <code>sender.rb</code> which is pretty simple:</p>

</p><p><span>sleep</span> <span>0.001</span> <span># Delay to allow the receiver to process the signal</span>
</p><p><span>end</span>
</p><p><span>end</span>
</p></code></pre>
<p>For each byte (8-bit structure) we extract the bit performing the <em>right shift</em> + <em>AND</em> oprerations. The result is the extracted bit.</p>
<p>In the receiver window:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p><span>$</span> <span>ruby</span> <span>receiver.rb</span>
</p><p><span>Process</span> <span>ID:</span> <span>68968</span>
</p></code></pre>
<p>And in the sender window:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p><span>$</span> <span>ruby</span> <span>sender.rb</span> <span>68968</span> <span>h</span>
</p></code></pre>
<p>The receiver will print:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p><span>$</span> <span>ruby</span> <span>receiver.rb</span>
</p><p><span>Process</span> <span>ID:</span> <span>68968</span>

</p></code></pre>
<p><em>Processes sending messages with only two signals!</em> How wonderful is that?</p>
<h3>Sending the ‚Äúhello‚Äù message</h3>
<p>Now, sending the hello message is super easy. The sender is already able to send not only a letter but any message using signals:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p><span>$</span> <span>ruby</span> <span>sender.rb</span> <span>68968</span> <span>hello</span>
</p><p><span># And the receiver:</span>
</p><p><span>Received</span> <span>byte:</span> <span>104</span><span></span> <span>(</span><span>h</span><span>)</span>
</p><p><span>Received</span> <span>byte:</span> <span>101</span><span></span> <span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span>
</p><p><span>Received</span> <span>byte:</span> <span>108</span><span></span> <span>(</span><span>l</span><span>)</span>
</p><p><span>Received</span> <span>byte:</span> <span>108</span><span></span> <span>(</span><span>l</span><span>)</span>
</p><p><span>Received</span> <span>byte:</span> <span>111</span><span></span> <span>(</span><span>o</span><span>)</span>
</p></code></pre>
<p>Just change the <code>receiver</code> implementation a little bit:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p><span>def</span> <span>decode_signal</span><span>(</span><span>bit</span><span>)</span>
</p><p><span>accumulate_bit</span><span>(</span><span>bit</span><span>)</span>
</p><p><span>return</span> <span>unless</span> <span>@position</span> <span>==</span> <span>8</span> <span># if not yet accumulated a byte, keep accumulating</span>
</p><p><span>print</span> <span>@accumulator</span><span>.</span><span>chr</span> <span># print the byte as a character</span>
</p><p><span>@accumulator</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span> <span># reset the accumulator</span>
</p><p><span>@position</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span> <span># reset position for the next byte</span>
</p><p><span>end</span>
</p></code></pre>
<p>And then:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p><span>$</span> <span>ruby</span> <span>sender.rb</span> <span>96875</span> <span>Hello</span>
</p><p><span># In the receiver's terminal</span>
</p><p><span>Process</span> <span>ID:</span> <span>96875</span>
</p><p><span>Hello</span>
</p></code></pre>
<p>However, if we send the message again, the receiver will print everything in the same line:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p>$ <span>ruby</span> <span>sender</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span> <span>96875</span> <span>Hello</span>
</p><p>$ <span>ruby</span> <span>sender</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span> <span>96875</span> <span>Hello</span>
</p><p><span># In the receiver's terminal</span>
</p><p><span>Process</span> <span>ID</span><span>:</span> <span>96875</span>
</p><p><span>HelloHello</span>
</p></code></pre>
<p>It‚Äôs obvious: the receiver doesn‚Äôt know where the sender finished the message, so it‚Äôs impossible to know where we should stop one message and print the next one on a new line with <code>\n</code>.</p>
<p>We should then determine how the sender indicates the end of the message. How about being it all <em>zeroes</em> (<code>0000 0000</code>)?</p>
<ul>
<li>We send the message: first 5 bytes representing the ‚Äúhello‚Äù message</li>
<li>Then we send a ‚ÄúNULL terminator‚Äù, just one byte <em>0</em> (<code>0000 0000</code>)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p>0110 1000 # h
</p><p>0110 0101 # e
</p><p>0110 1000 # l
</p><p>0110 1000 # l
</p><p>0110 1111 # o
</p><p>0000 0000 # NULL
</p></code></pre>
<p>Hence, when the <em>receiver</em> gets a NULL terminator, it will print a line feed <code>\n</code>. Let‚Äôs change the <code>sender.rb</code> first:</p>
<pre><code translate="no" tabindex="0"><p><span>receiver_pid</span> <span>=</span> <span>ARGV</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>to_i</span>

<p><em>Amazing, right?</em> We just built an entire communication system between two processes using one of the most primitive methods available: <strong>UNIX signals.</strong></p>
<p>The sky‚Äôs the limit now! Why not build a <em>full-fledged message broker</em> using this crazy technique?</p>
<h2>A modest message broker using UNIX signals</h2>
<p>We‚Äôll break down the development into three components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Broker</strong>: the intermediary that routes messages</li>
<li><strong>Consumer</strong>: processes that receive messages</li>
<li><strong>Producer</strong>: processes that send messages</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://leandronsp.com/uploads/3395.png" alt="image"></p>
<ol>
<li>Let‚Äôs start with the Broker. It should register itself with the producer, then trap incoming signals, decode them, and enqueue the messages for delivery to consumers via outgoing signals:</li>

<p>If you‚Äôve been following along, this shouldn‚Äôt be hard to understand, but I‚Äôll break down how this beautiful piece of code works:</p>
<ul>
<li>The codec is initialized with the bit position at zero, as well as the accumulator</li>
<li>A buffer is also initialized to store accumulated bits until a complete byte is formed</li>
<li>The <code>accumulate_bit</code> method should be familiar from our earlier implementation, but it now accepts a closure (block) that lets the caller decide what to do with each decoded byte</li>
<li><code>send_message</code> encodes a message into bits and sends them via UNIX signals</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything in action:</p>
<p><img src="https://leandronsp.com/uploads/3170.png" alt="image"></p>
<p><em>How cool, amazing, wonderful, impressive, astonishing is that?</em></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yes, we built a message broker using nothing but <strong>UNIX signals</strong> and a bit of Ruby magic. Sure, <strong>it‚Äôs not production-ready</strong>, and you definitely shouldn‚Äôt use this in your next startup (please don‚Äôt), but that was never the point.</p>
<p>The real takeaway here isn‚Äôt the broker itself: it‚Äôs understanding how the fundamentals work. We explored binary operations, UNIX signals, and IPC in a hands-on way that most people never bother with.</p>
<p>We took something ‚Äúuseless‚Äù and made it work, just for fun. So next time someone asks you about message brokers, you can casually mention that you once built (or saw) one using just two signals. And if they look at you weird, well, that‚Äôs their problem. Now go build something equally useless and amazing. The world needs more hackers who experiment just for the fun of it.</p>
<p><em>Happy hacking!</em></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/20/aws_outage_amazon_brain_drain_corey_quinn/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/20/aws_outage_amazon_brain_drain_corey_quinn/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45649178">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>column</span> "It's always DNS" is a long-standing sysadmin saw, and with good reason: a disproportionate number of outages are at their heart DNS issues. And so today, as AWS is still repairing its downed cloud as this article goes to press, it becomes clear that the culprit is once again DNS. But if you or I know this, AWS certainly does.</p>
<p>And so, a quiet suspicion starts to circulate: where have the senior AWS engineers who've been to this dance before gone? And the answer increasingly is that they've left the building ‚Äî taking decades of hard-won institutional knowledge about how AWS's systems work at scale right along with them.</p>
<h3>What happened?</h3>
<p>AWS reports that on October 20, at 12:11 AM PDT, it began investigating ‚Äúincreased error rates and latencies for multiple AWS services in the US-EAST-1 Region.‚Äù About an hour later, at 1:26 AM, the company confirmed ‚Äúsignificant error rates for requests made to the DynamoDB endpoint‚Äù in that region. By 2:01 AM, engineers had identified <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/20/aws_outage_chaos/">DNS resolution of the DynamoDB API endpoint</a> for US-EAST-1 as the likely root cause, which led to cascading failures for most other things in that region. DynamoDB is a "foundational service" upon which a whole mess of other AWS services rely, so the blast radius for an outage touching this thing can be huge.</p>
<p>As a result, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/20/amazon_aws_outage/">much of the internet stopped working</a>: banking, gaming, social media, government services, buying things I don't need on Amazon.com itself, etc.</p>
<p>AWS has given increasing levels of detail, as is their tradition, when outages strike, and as new information comes to light. Reading through it, one really gets the sense that it took them 75 minutes to go from "things are breaking" to "we've narrowed it down to a single service endpoint, but are still researching," which is something of a bitter pill to swallow. To be clear: I've seen zero signs that this stems from a lack of transparency, and every indication that they legitimately did not know what was breaking for a patently absurd length of time.</p>

    

<p>Note that for those 75 minutes, visitors to the AWS status page (reasonably wondering why their websites and other workloads had just burned down and crashed into the sea) were met with an "all is well!" default response. Ah well, it's not as if AWS had <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/12721/" rel="nofollow">previously called out slow outage notification times</a> as an area for improvement. <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/11201/" rel="nofollow">Multiple times</a> even. We can <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/41926/" rel="nofollow">keep doing this</a> if you'd like.</p>
<h3>The prophecy</h3>
<p>AWS is very, very good at infrastructure. You can tell this is a true statement by the fact that a single one of their 38 regions going down (albeit a very important region!) causes this kind of attention, as opposed to it being "just another Monday outage." At AWS's scale, all of their issues are complex; this isn't going to be a simple issue that someone should have caught, just because they've already hit similar issues years ago and ironed out the kinks in their resilience story.</p>
<p>Once you reach a certain point of scale, there are no simple problems left. What's more concerning to me is the way it seems AWS has been flailing all day trying to run this one to ground. Suddenly, I'm reminded of something I had tried very hard to forget.</p>

        


        

<p>At the end of 2023, Justin Garrison left AWS and <a target="_blank" href="https://justingarrison.com/blog/2023-12-30-amazons-silent-sacking/" rel="nofollow">roasted them on his way out the door</a>. He stated that AWS had seen an increase in Large Scale Events (or LSEs), and predicted significant outages in 2024. It would seem that he discounted the power of inertia, but the pace of senior AWS departures certainly hasn't slowed ‚Äî and now, with an outage like this, one is forced to wonder whether those departures are themselves a contributing factor.</p>
<p>You can hire a bunch of very smart people who will explain how DNS works at a deep technical level (or you can hire me, who will incorrect you by explaining that it's a database), but the one thing you can't hire for is the person who remembers that when DNS starts getting wonky, check that seemingly unrelated system in the corner, because it's historically played a contributing role to some outages of yesteryear.</p>

        

<p>When that tribal knowledge departs, you're left having to reinvent an awful lot of in-house expertise that didn't want to participate in your RTO games, or play Layoff Roulette yet again this cycle. This doesn't impact your service reliability ‚Äî until one day it very much does, in spectacular fashion. I suspect that day is today.</p>

</ul>
<h3>The talent drain evidence</h3>
<p>This is <em>The Register</em>, a respected journalistic outlet. As a result, I know that if I publish this piece as it stands now, an AWS PR flak will appear as if by magic, waving their hands, insisting that "there is no talent exodus at AWS," a la Baghdad Bob. Therefore, let me forestall that time-wasting enterprise with some data.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a fact that there have been <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/17/amazon-web-services-has-some-layoffs.html" rel="nofollow">27,000+ Amazonians impacted by layoffs</a> between 2022 and 2024, continuing into 2025. It's hard to know how many of these were AWS versus other parts of its Amazon parent, because the company is notoriously tight-lipped about staffing issues.</li>

<li>Internal documents reportedly say that Amazon <a target="_blank" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-attrition-leadership-ctsmd-201800110-201800100.html" rel="nofollow">suffers from 69 percent to 81 percent regretted attrition</a> across all employment levels. In other words, "people quitting who we wish didn't."</li>

<li>The internet is full of anecdata of senior Amazonians lamenting the hamfisted approach of their Return to Office initiative; <a target="_blank" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-back-office-crusade-could-090200105.html/" rel="nofollow">experts have weighed in</a> citing similar concerns.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you were one of the early employees who built these systems, the world is your oyster. There's little reason to remain at a company that increasingly demonstrates apparent disdain for your expertise.</p>
<h3>My take</h3>
<p>This is a tipping point moment. Increasingly, it seems that the talent who understood the deep failure modes is gone. The new, leaner, presumably less expensive teams lack the institutional knowledge needed to, if not prevent these outages in the first place, significantly reduce the time to detection and recovery. Remember, there was a time when Amazon's "Frugality" leadership principle meant doing more with less, not doing everything with basically nothing. AWS's operational strength was built on redundant, experienced people, and when you cut to the bone, basic things start breaking.</p>
<p>I want to be very clear on one last point. This isn't about the technology being old. It's about the people maintaining it being new. If I had to guess what happens next, the market will forgive AWS this time, but the pattern will continue.</p>
<p>AWS will almost certainly say this was an "isolated incident," but when you've hollowed out your engineering ranks, every incident becomes more likely. The next outage is already brewing. It's just a matter of which understaffed team trips over which edge case first, because the chickens are coming home to roost. ¬Æ</p>

Clear is the current Liquid Glass design, which is more transparent and shows the background underneath buttons, bars, and menus, while tinted increases the opacity of Liquid Glass and adds more contrast.</p>
<p>The new setting can be found on iOS and iPadOS by going to Settings &gt; Display and Brightness, or System Settings &gt; Appearance on the Mac.</p>
<p>Apple says that the new toggle was added because during the beta testing period over the summer, user feedback suggested that some people would prefer to have a more opaque option for Liquid Glass. The added setting provides additional customization in iOS 26.1, iPadOS 26.1, and macOS Tahoe 26.1. </p>
<p>Increasing opacity and adding contrast applies to Liquid Glass throughout the operating system, including in apps and Lock Screen notifications.</p>
<p>There are multiple other new features in iOS 26.1, including a new slide to stop feature for alarms and timers, new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> languages, a redesigned <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app icon, changes to the Settings app, and more, with a full list of features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-1-beta-features/">available in our iOS 26.1 feature guide</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
             
            <p>In October, <a href="https://openai.com/index/new-credit-facility-enhances-financial-flexibility/" rel="noreferrer">OpenAI secured a 4 billion dollar revolving credit facility from J.P. Morgan and several other banks</a>.  I was surprised when I heard this because OpenAI is a young company with no earnings.  Shouldn't all their capital come from investors?  Let's run some numbers.</p><h2 id="from-first-principles">From first principles</h2><p>Let's do an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expected-value.asp" rel="noreferrer">Expected Value (EV)</a> calculation, first from the perspective of an investor and then from the perspective of a lender.  We'll pick some arbitrary parameters first, then refine.</p><p>Putting our investor hat on, the possible returns for investing $1,000 into OpenAI look like this:</p><ul><li>Cost: $1,000</li><li>Case 1 (90%): OpenAI goes bankrupt. Return: $0</li><li>Case 2 (9%): OpenAI becomes a big successful company and goes 10x.  Return: $10,000</li><li>Case 3 (1%): OpenAI becomes the big new thing and goes 100x.  Return: $100,000</li></ul><p>Our expected value is:</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
\[\begin{align}
  EV &amp;= -1000 + 0.9 \times 0 + 0.09 \times 10000 + 0.01 \times 100000\\
  EV &amp;= -1000 + 0 + 900 + 1000\\
  EV &amp;= 900
\end{align}\]
</p><!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>The EV is positive, so this is a good investment.  Obviously, there's a 90% chance of it going to zero, so if this were our only investment, it would be an insanely risky one.  But provided we can do many investments like this and provided their failure cases aren't correlated, this would be a profitable strategy.</p><p>What happens if we instead put our lender hat on?  Using the same probabilities as above, the possible returns for lending $1,000 to OpenAI at 5% interest look like this:</p><ul><li>Cost: $1,000</li><li>Case 1 (90%): OpenAI goes bankrupt. Return: $0</li><li>Case 2 (9%): OpenAI becomes a big successful company and goes 10x.  Return: $1,000 + 5% interest = $1,050</li><li>Case 3 (1%): OpenAI becomes the big new thing and goes 100x.  Return: $1,000 + 5% interest = $1,050</li></ul><p>Lenders don't benefit directly from the success of the company.  Whether it barely scrapes by but manages to repay the loan or becomes the greatest company ever and easily repays the loan, it's all the same to a lender.  So, we can merge cases 2 and 3 into:</p><ul><li>Case 2+3 (10%): OpenAI doesn't go bankrupt.  Return: $1,000 + 5% interest = $1,050</li></ul><p>This makes our EV in the lending case:</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
\[\begin{align}
  EV &amp;= -1000 + 0.9 \times 0 + 0.1 \times 1050\\
  EV &amp;= -1000 + 0 + 105\\
  EV &amp;= -895
\end{align}\]
</p><!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>The EV is negative, so we'd end up losing most of our money on average.  Lending on these terms doesn't make sense.</p><p>There are two numbers we made up in the above calculation: the probability of bankruptcy and the interest rate.  Let's leave the interest rate fixed at 5% and see what the probability \(p\) would have to be for us to break even.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
\[\begin{align}
  EV &amp;= -1000 + p \times 0 + (1 - p) \times 1050\\
  EV &amp;= -1000 + 1050 - p \times 1050 \\
  EV &amp;= 50 - p \times 1050 \\[0.5cm]
  &amp; \text{Set EV to 0} \\[0.5cm]
  0 &amp;= 50 - p \times 1050 \\
  p &amp;= \frac{50}{1050} \\
  p &amp;= 0.0476
\end{align}\]
</p><!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>So, we'd break even if the probability of OpenAI going bankrupt was only about 5%.  In practice, we'd want it to be lower than that so that we made a profit and so that we had a margin of safety in case our assumptions were wrong.</p><p>This 5% failure rate seems very optimistic to me, but this scenario is basically the one the consortium of banks got into.  Concrete details on the deal are sparse, but this <a href="https://thecioleaders.com/openai-locks-down-4-billion-revolving-credit-putting-liquidity-over-10-billion/" rel="noreferrer">CIO Leaders article</a> claims the interest rate was "SOFR + 100 basis points".  The <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/sofr" rel="noreferrer">overnight SOFR rate</a> is about 4.1% in October, so this puts OpenAI's interest at about 5%.</p><h2 id="from-market-data">From market data</h2><p>The problem with the above expected value calculation is that it's very idealized.  The shape of it is correct, but the real world is too messy to be accurately represented by just a couple of parameters.  I think it would be very difficult to build a model with enough predictive accuracy to be useful and I suspect there just isn't enough publicly available data to plug into it to make it work.</p><p>Luckily for us, banks exist!  We know the banks have the better model and the non-public data and we know they came up with about 5% interest.  So, let's work back from that and see what we can learn.</p><p>We're talking about a loan here and that's very similar to issuing bonds.  So, we should be able to look at the bond market and find companies in similar financial health (from the perspective of a creditor).  One problem is that we only know the overnight rate for OpenAI of about 5%, but bonds on the market will have longer maturities.  We need to calculate what what yield a longer maturity loan would require and we can do that by looking at US treasuries.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us" rel="noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, the three month treasuries have a yield of 3.94%.  One year ones have a yield of 3.58%.</p><figure><img src="https://marketunpack.com/content/images/2025/10/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="856" height="436" srcset="https://marketunpack.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/image.png 600w, https://marketunpack.com/content/images/2025/10/image.png 856w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><b><strong>Figure 1.</strong></b><span> Treasury Yields for US government bonds. The table shows the following yields: 3 months is 3.94%, 6 month is 3.81%, 12 month is 3.58%, 2 year is 3.50%, 5 year is 3.62%, 10 year is 4.03%, 30 year is 4.62%. This describes a smile that initially goes down, goes back up to starting level at 10 years, then continues upwards.</span></figcaption></figure><p>One way of thinking about corporate bonds is that they're basically treasury bonds plus some premium to account for the risk of default.  This <em>default spread</em> seems to be about \(5\% - 3.94\% \approx 1\%\) in OpenAI's case.  By this logic, OpenAI's one year debt would have a yield of about 4.6%.</p><p>Can we find some one year bonds with a yield of 4.6%?</p><figure><img src="https://marketunpack.com/content/images/2025/10/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1133" height="685" srcset="https://marketunpack.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/image-3.png 600w, https://marketunpack.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/image-3.png 1000w, https://marketunpack.com/content/images/2025/10/image-3.png 1133w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><b><strong>Figure 2.</strong></b><span> A sample of corporate USD bonds expiring in one year or less, sorted by their mid-yield to maturity. (Source: Saxo Bank)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some bonds in the vicinity of what we're looking for are:</p><ul><li>4.99%: HCA Inc. (US healthcare provider with credit rating BBB),</li><li>4.73%: Ziraat Katilim (Turkish bank with credit rating B+), and</li><li>4.24%: Citigroup (US bank with credit rating A).</li></ul><p>In fact, scanning the sample above, it's mostly banks with BBB and A ratings.  So, the consortium of big banks seems to have lent money to OpenAI at the kind of rates they themselves are borrowing at.</p><p>Looking at just a few bonds is interesting, but anecdotal.  It would be better if we had some statistics across the whole bond market.  Helpfully, Prof Damodaran goes through the exercise of calculating just <a href="https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ratings.html" rel="noreferrer">such statistics</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250827084311/https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ratings.html" rel="noreferrer">archive link</a>) every year, most recently this January.</p><figure><img src="https://marketunpack.com/content/images/2025/10/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="417" height="458"><figcaption><b><strong>Figure 3.</strong></b><span> To quote the author: "This is a table that relates the interest coverage ratio of a firm to a 'synthetic' rating and a default spread that goes with that rating. The link between interest coverage ratios and ratings was developed by looking at all rated companies in the United States. The default spreads are obtained from traded bonds. Adding that number to a riskfree rate should yield the pre-tax cost of borrowing for a firm."</span></figcaption></figure><p>Looking up OpenAI's default spread of 1% in that table, we see it's at the level we'd expect for an A- or BBB firm (same as with the anecdotal search earlier).  This normally corresponds to an interest coverage ratio of 3.00-4.24.  However, OpenAI's actual interest coverage ratio is negative because their earnings before interest are negative.</p><p>This doesn't make sense: any way we look at it, OpenAI is getting the kind of interest rates only much more established and profitable firms would be getting.  So, my initial surprise at hearing about this is justified, but there must be an explanation because the big banks wouldn't make such an obvious mistake.</p><h2 id="making-this-make-sense">Making this make sense</h2><p>OpenAI is not a profitable company.  It's also a private company, so we don't get to see audited financials, but we still know some things.  This <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-establishes-4-bln-credit-facility-2024-10-03/" rel="noreferrer">Reuters article</a> claims OpenAI is going to generate $3.6 billion in revenue this year, but the costs will lead to a loss of more than $5 billion.</p><p>There's also speculation that their revenue next year will jump to $11.6 billion.  However, there's no speculation about what their earnings will be because they're currently selling their services below cost and there isn't really any story as to how they'll turn this profitable.</p><p>The banks are lenders in this scenario, so they don't really care about how many users OpenAI gets or how huge their revenue becomes.  As lenders, all they care about is getting paid back and it really doesn't seem like OpenAI will have the earnings to do that.  But maybe earnings aren't what matters here.</p><p>If OpenAI can't pay its debts, it goes bankrupt and the creditors seize the company.  Importantly, they seize it from the equity holders.  Who are these equity holders?  According to <a href="https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2025/09/who-really-owns-openai-billion-dollar.html" rel="noreferrer">this Digital Information World article</a>, the owners are Microsoft (28%), OpenAI non-profit and employees (52%), and other investors (20%).</p><p>So, the hypothetical is OpenAI runs out of money.  They have revenue, but since their costs are higher, they don't actually have anything left over.  They can't make interest payments on their debt, so they go bankrupt, and the banks seize the company from Microsoft.  I don't think Microsoft will allow this to happen.  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2024-q4/press-release-webcast" rel="noreferrer">Microsoft's earnings for last year were $88 billion</a>, so I think Microsoft will just pay off OpenAI's $4 billion debt in this scenario.  And I think the banks know all this.</p><p>So, the banks loaning money to OpenAI at an A- interest rate doesn't make sense, but effectively loaning the same to <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/sourceId/37291" rel="noreferrer">Microsoft with its AAA rating</a> does, and that's what's actually happening here.</p>

But overall? The experience of being in the stadium was worse a year later. After thinking about it on the flight home, I think the reason was the stadium's rush to automation and AI in several places. </p><figure><img src="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/2025/10/SF-20Giants-2004.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/SF-20Giants-2004.webp 600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/SF-20Giants-2004.webp 1000w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1600/2025/10/SF-20Giants-2004.webp 1600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w2400/2025/10/SF-20Giants-2004.webp 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h2 id="spoiler-alert-deploying-cameraai-recognition-for-everything-isnt-great">Spoiler alert: deploying camera/AI recognition for everything isn't great</h2><p>Every concession stand, including the ones that didn't even serve hot food, used the apparatus in the photo above to control all checkouts. I assume these are expensive units, because most places that used to have several checkout lanes only had one of them, requiring everyone to checkout through a single location.</p><p>Here's how they worked in the stadium yesterday: You place all your items on the white shelf with some space between them. Although they were clearly designed to be a self-checkout experience, the stadium had a staff member rearrange your items, then for about 30 seconds the kiosk would be thinking. After, it would pop up all items on the menu, and the staff member would have to tap to confirm what each item was. Then another 30 seconds to calculate and move the purchase to a point of sale/tap on the side, then you'd pay. </p><p>Overall, this added at least one, if not two full minutes to every transaction that didn't normally have those delays. Lines were unbearably long, and it was a hot day in LA yesterday, at 87¬∫F/30¬∫C. I bought food and drinks several times over the the course of the day and had to endure the process multiple times.</p><h2 id="when-you-add-object-recognition-youre-incentivized-to-reduce-choices">When you add object recognition, you're incentivized to reduce choices</h2><p>Here's an unintended consequence of moving all your concession stand checkouts to computer vision: it's easier if you have less things on offer.</p><p>Case in point: Let's talk about my favorite concession stand at BMO last year, a place that served rotisserie chicken with waffle fries and chicken sandwiches. Here's our meal from 2024, it was well-seasoned, came with great sauces, and was one of the best meals I had at a stadium in my entire nationwide tour, which is why I remembered it.</p><figure><img src="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/2025/10/IMG_5563.JPG" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1974" srcset="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/IMG_5563.JPG 600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/IMG_5563.JPG 1000w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1600/2025/10/IMG_5563.JPG 1600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w2400/2025/10/IMG_5563.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I returned to the same concession stand yesterday and here's their new menu:</p><figure><img src="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/2025/10/IMG_2925.JPG" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1380" srcset="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/IMG_2925.JPG 600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/IMG_2925.JPG 1000w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1600/2025/10/IMG_2925.JPG 1600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w2400/2025/10/IMG_2925.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>When your checkout stand relies on computer vision, it's probably confusing to have half a dozen different menu items that fans can enjoy. But if you could condense it to just chicken tenders, fries, a hot dog, and boxes of candy, your computer vision-based checkout system will probably work faster since it has to do less work with the obvious shapes of each of those items.</p><figure><img src="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/2025/10/IMG_5571.JPG" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1983" srcset="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/IMG_5571.JPG 600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/IMG_5571.JPG 1000w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1600/2025/10/IMG_5571.JPG 1600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w2400/2025/10/IMG_5571.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Looking through my photos from my 2024 visit, I saw a variety of food options including smashburgers and a Korean BBQ rice bowl I also tried, pictured above. </p><p>If foods are difficult for computer vision to decipher, why not get rid of most options?

Next, you had to stand there for about 2 minutes while it said "calculating checkout" before showing you a receipt on the screen.</p><p>What was supposed to be fast was very slow. The person in front of me bought two items and saw she got charged for three. Since there were no paper receipts, she took a photo of the machine before going to the guest services to complain.

When it takes people ten minutes to buy a bottle of water (I didn't see automated water fillers at the restrooms), the embrace of slow AI/Camera-based checkout systems starts to become a health and safety issue for the crowd.</p><h2 id="but-mrs-lincoln%E2%80%94besides-the-obvious%E2%80%94how-was-the-play">But Mrs. Lincoln‚Äîbesides the obvious‚Äîhow was the play?</h2><p>A year later visiting the same stadium, I got worse food, slower service, and a worse overall experience.

          x86-64 assembly.
</p> <p>
The Playground web app provides an online code editor where you
        can write, compile, and share assembly code for a wide
        range of popular assemblers such as GNU As, Fasm and Nasm.
</p> <p>
Unlike traditional onlide editors, this playground
          allows you to follow the execution of your program step by step,
        inspecting memory and registers of the running process from a GDB-like interface.
</p> <p>
You can bring your own programs!
        Drag and drop into the app any x86-64-Linux static executable to run and 
        debug it in the same sandboxed environment, without having to install anything.
</p> </section> <section> <h3>Who is this for?</h3> <p>The app is for anyone that wants to run amd64 assembly snippets or
          inspect the inner workings of simple Linux ELF files.</p> <p>It has been designed with the academic world of binary exploitation in mind;
            The debugger interface offers visualizations similar to the GDB+PwnGDB debugger plugin,
            and all the controls are labelled with the respective GDB commands.
</p> <p>Combined with <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a>, this app provides
            a noise-free environment to learn the basics behind the inner workings of a Linux process.
            When you are ready, it includes the guides and resources necessary to keep experimenting
            on your own linux environment, with the actual GDB debugger.
</p> </section> <div> <div> <h3>Designed for the web </h3> <p>Have you ever seen a responsive debugger?
        The app places the mobile experience at the center of its design,
        and can be embedded in any web page
        to add interactivity to technical tutorials or documentations.
</p> <p>
Follow the guide to <a href="https://x64.halb.it/"> embed in your website </a> both the asm editor and debugger.
</p> </div> <p><img src="https://x64.halb.it/_astro/app_mobile_art.nN-X8L8r_1Q1Cl8.webp" alt="Screenshot of the Playground web app, showing the layout on mobile devices." width="581" height="815" loading="lazy" decoding="async"> </p> </div> <section> <h3>Offline-first and open-source</h3> <p>
The app is open-source, and <a href="https://github.com/robalb/x86-64-playground">available on Github</a>.
  It's powered by the <a href="https://github.com/jart/blink/">Blink Emulator</a>,
  which emulates an x86-64-Linux environment entirely client side in your browser.
  This means that all the code you write, or the excutables you debug are never sent to the server.
</p> <p>
everything runs in your browser, and once the Web App loads it will work 
  without an internet connection.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent">
    
<p><strong>September 2025</strong></p>
<p>XTX is an algorithmic trading firm: it builds statistical models that produce price forecasts for over 50,000 financial instruments worldwide. We use those forecasts to make trades. As XTX's research efforts to build better models ramped up, the demand for resources kept increasing.</p>
<p>The firm started out with a couple of desktops and an NFS server, and 10 years later ended up with tens of thousands of high-end GPUs, hundreds of thousands of CPUs, and hundreds of petabytes of storage.</p>
<p>As compute grew, storage struggled to keep up. We rapidly outgrew NFS first and existing open-source and commercial filesystems later. After evaluating a variety of third-party solutions, we made the decision to implement our own filesystem, which we called TernFS<sup><a href="#f1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>We have decided to open source our efforts: TernFS is <a href="https://github.com/XTXMarkets/ternfs">available as free software on our public GitHub.</a> This post <a href="#another-filesystem">motivates TernFS</a>, explains its <a href="#high-level">high-level architecture</a>, and then explores some <a href="#important-details">key implementation details</a>. If you just want to spin up a local TernFS cluster, head to the <a href="https://github.com/XTXMarkets/ternfs?tab=readme-ov-file#playing-with-a-local-ternfs-instance">README</a>.</p>

<h2>Another filesystem?</h2>
<p>There's a reason why every major tech company has developed its own distributed filesystem ‚Äî they're crucial to running large-scale compute efforts, and liable to cause intense disruption if they malfunction. <sup><a href="#f2">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>XTX was in the same position, so we designed TernFS to be a one-stop solution for most of our storage needs, going from relatively 'cold' storage of raw market data to short-lived random-access data used to communicate between GPU jobs running on our cluster.</p>
<p>TernFS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is designed to scale up to tens of exabytes, trillions of files, millions of concurrent clients.</li>
<li>Stores file contents redundantly to protect against drive failures.</li>
<li>Has no single point of failure in its metadata services.</li>
<li>Supports file snapshot to protect against accidental file deletion.</li>
<li>Can span across multiple regions.</li>
<li>Is hardware agnostic and uses TCP/IP to communicate.</li>
<li>Utilizes different types of storage (such as flash vs. hard disks) cost effectively.</li>
<li>Exposes read/write access through its own API over TCP and UDP, and a Linux kernel filesystem module.</li>
<li>Requires no external service and has a minimal set of build dependencies. <sup><a href="#f3">[3]</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>Naturally, there are some limitations, the main ones being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files are immutable ‚Äî once they're written they can't be modified.</li>
<li>TernFS should not be used for tiny files ‚Äî our median file size is 2MB.</li>
<li>The throughput of directory creation and removal is significantly constrained compared to other operations.</li>
<li>TernFS is permissionless, deferring that responsibility to other services.</li>
</ul>
<p>We started designing TernFS in early 2022 and began putting it into production in summer 2023. By mid-2024 all of our machine learning efforts were driven out of TernFS, and we're migrating the rest of the firm's storage needs onto it as well.</p>
<p>As of September 2025, our TernFS deployment stores more than 500PB across 30,000 disks, 10,000 flash drives, and three data centres. At peak we serve multiple terabytes per second. To this day, we haven't lost a single byte.</p>

<h2>High-level overview</h2>
<p>Now that the stage is set, we're ready to explain the various components that make up TernFS. TernFS' core API is implemented by four services:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Metadata shards</em> store the directory structure and file metadata.</li>
<li>The <em>cross-directory coordinator</em> (or CDC) executes cross-shard transactions.</li>
<li><em>Block services</em> store file contents.</li>
<li>The <em>registry</em> stores information about all the other services and monitors them.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the next few sections, we'll describe the high-level design of each service and then give more background on <a href="#important-details">other relevant implementation details</a>.<sup><a href="#f4">[4]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Metadata</h3>
<p>To talk about metadata, we first need to explain what metadata <em>is</em> in TernFS. The short answer is: 'everything that is not file contents.' The slightly longer answer is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directory entries, including all files and directory names.</li>
<li>File metadata including creation/modification/access time, logical file size, and so on.</li>
<li>The mapping between files and the <a href="#block-services">blocks containing their contents</a>.</li>
<li>Other ancillary data structures to facilitate maintenance operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>TernFS' metadata is split into 256 logical <em>shards</em>. Shards never communicate with each other. This is a general principle in TernFS: each service is disaggregated from the others, deferring to the clients to communicate with each service directly.<sup><a href="#f5">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>A logical shard is further split into five physical instances, one leader and four followers, in a typical distributed consensus setup. The distributed consensus engine is provided by a purpose-built Raft-like implementation, which we call LogsDB, while RocksDB is used to implement read/write capabilities within a shard instance.</p>
<p>Currently all reads and writes go through the leader, but it would be trivial to allow clients to read from followers, and with a bit more effort to switch to a write-write setup.</p>

<p>Splitting the metadata into 256 shards from the get-go simplifies the design, given that horizontal scaling of metadata requires no rebalancing, just the addition of more metadata servers.</p>
<p>For instance, our current deployment can serve hundreds of petabytes and more than 100,000 compute nodes with just 10 metadata servers per data centre, with each server housing roughly 25 shard leaders and 100 shard followers.</p>
<p>Given that the metadata servers are totally decoupled from one another, this means that we can scale metadata performance by 25√ó trivially, and by 100√ó if we were to start offloading metadata requests to followers.</p>
<p>TernFS shards metadata by assigning each directory to a single shard. This is done in a simple round-robin fashion by the <a href="#cdc">cross-directory coordinator</a>. Once a directory is created, all its directory entries and the files in it are housed in the same shard.</p>
<p>This design decision has downsides: TernFS assumes that the load will be spread across the 256 logical shards naturally. This is not a problem in large deployments, given that they will contain many directories, but it is something to keep in mind.<sup><a href="#f6">[6]</a></sup></p>


<h3>Cross-directory transactions</h3>
<p>Most of the metadata activity is contained within a single shard:</p>
<ul>
<li>File creation, same-directory renames, and deletion.</li>
<li>Listing directory contents.</li>
<li>Getting attributes of files or directories.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, some operations do require coordination between shards, namely directory creation, directory removal, and moving directory entries across different directories.</p>
<p>The <em>cross-directory coordinator</em> (CDC) performs these distributed transactions using a privileged metadata shard API. The CDC transactions are stateful, and therefore the CDC uses RocksDB and LogsDB much like the metadata shards themselves to persist its state safely.</p>

<p>The CDC executes transactions in parallel, which increases throughput considerably, but it is still a bottleneck when it comes to creating, removing, or moving directories. This means that TernFS has a relatively low throughput when it comes to CDC operations.<sup><a href="#f7">[7]</a></sup> <a name="block-services"></a></p>

<h3>Block services, or file contents</h3>
<p>In TernFS, files are split into chunks of data called <em>blocks</em>. Blocks are read and written to by <em>block services</em>. A block service is typically a single drive (be it a hard disk or a flash drive) storing blocks. At XTX a typical storage server will contain around 100 hard disks or 25 flash drives ‚Äî or in TernFS parlance 100 or 25 block services.<sup><a href="#f8">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>Read/write access to the block service is provided using a simple TCP API currently implemented by a Go process. This process is hardware agnostic and uses the Go standard library to read and write blocks to a conventional local file system. We originally planned to rewrite the Go process in C++, and possibly write to block devices directly, but the idiomatic Go implementation has proven performant enough for our needs so far. <a name="registry"></a></p>
<h3>The registry</h3>
<p>The final piece of the TernFS puzzle is the <em>registry</em>. The registry stores the location of each instance of service (be it a metadata shard, the CDC, or a block storage node). A client only needs to know the address of the registry to mount TernFS ‚Äî it'll then gather the locations of the other services from it.</p>
<p>In TernFS all locations are IPv4 addresses. Working with IPv4 directly simplifies the kernel module considerably, since DNS lookups are quite awkward in the Linux kernel. The exception to this rule is addressing the registry itself, for which DNS is used.</p>
<p>The registry also stores additional information, such as the capacity and available size of each drive, who is a follower or a leader in LogsDB clusters, and so on.</p>
<p>Predictably, the registry itself is a RocksDB and LogsDB C++ process, given its statefulness. <a name="going-global"></a></p>
<h3>Going global</h3>
<p>TernFS tries very hard not to lose data, by storing both metadata and file contents on many different drives and servers. However, we also want to be resilient to the temporary or even permanent loss of one entire data centre. Therefore, TernFS can transparently scale across multiple <em>locations</em>.</p>
<p>The intended use for TernFS locations is for each location to converge to the same dataset. This means that each location will have to be provisioned with roughly equal resources.<sup><a href="#f9">[9]</a></sup> Both metadata and file contents replication are asynchronous. In general, we judge the event of losing an entire data centre rare enough to tolerate a time window where data is not fully replicated across locations.</p>

<p>Metadata replication is set up so that one location is the metadata primary. Write operations in non-primary locations pay a latency price since they are acknowledged only after they are written to the primary location, replicated, and applied in the originating location. In practice this hasn't been an issue since metadata write latencies are generally overshadowed by writing file contents.</p>
<p>There is no automated procedure to migrate off a metadata primary location ‚Äî again, we deem it a rare enough occurrence to tolerate manual intervention. In the future we plan to move from the current protocol to a multi-master protocol where each location can commit writes independently, which would reduce write latencies on secondary locations and remove the privileged status of the primary location.</p>
<p>File contents, unlike metadata, are written locally to the location the client is writing from. Replication to other locations happens in two ways: proactively and on-demand. Proactive replication is performed by tailing the metadata log and replicating new file contents. On-demand replication happens when a client requests file content which has not been replicated yet. <a name="important-details"></a> <a name="speaking-ternfs"></a></p>
<h2>Important Details</h2>
<p>Now that we've laid down the high-level design of TernFS, we can talk about several key implementation details that make TernFS safer, more performant, and more flexible.</p>
<h3>Talking to TernFS</h3>
<h4>Speaking TernFS' language</h4>
<p>The most direct way to talk to TernFS is by using its own API. All TernFS messages are defined using a custom serialization format we call <em>bincode</em>. We chose to develop a custom serialization format since we needed it to work within the confines of the <a href="#posix-shaped">Linux kernel</a> and to be easily chopped into UDP packets.</p>
<p>We intentionally kept the TernFS API stateless, in the sense that each request executes without regard to previous requests made by the same client. This is in contrast to protocols like NFS, whereby each connection is very stateful, holding resources such as open files, locks, and so on.</p>
<p>A stateless API dramatically simplifies the state machines that make up the TernFS core services, therefore simplifying their testing. It also forces each request to be idempotent, or in any case have clear retry semantics, since they might have to be replayed, which facilitates testing further.</p>
<p>It also allows the metadata shards and CDC API to be based on UDP rather than TCP, which makes the server and clients (especially the kernel module) simpler, due to doing away with the need for keeping TCP connections. The block service API is TCP based, since it is used to stream large amounts of contiguous data, and any UDP implementation would have to re-implement a reliable stream protocol. The registry API is also TCP-based, given that it is rarely used by clients, and occasionally needs to return large amounts of data.</p>
<p>While the TernFS API is simple out-of-the-box, we provide a permissively licensed Go library implementing common tasks that clients might want to perform, such as caching directory policies and retrying requests. This library is used to implement many TernFS processes that are not part of the core TernFS services, such as <a href="#scrubbing">scrubbing</a>, <a href="#snapshots">garbage collection</a>, <a href="#migrations">migrations</a>, and the <a href="#web-ui">web UI</a>.</p>

<h4>Making TernFS POSIX-shaped</h4>
<p>While the Go library is used for most ancillary tasks, some with high performance requirements, the main way to access TernFS at XTX is through its Linux kernel module.</p>
<p>This is because, when migrating our machine learning workflows to TernFS, we needed to support a vast codebase working with files directly. This not only meant that we needed to expose TernFS as a normal filesystem, but also that said normal filesystem API needed to be robust and performant enough for our machine learning needs.<sup><a href="#f10">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p>For this reason, we opted to work with Linux directly, rather than using FUSE. Working directly with the Linux kernel not only gave us the confidence that we could achieve our performance requirements but also allowed us to bend the POSIX API to our needs, something that would have been more difficult if we had used FUSE.<sup><a href="#f11">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>The main obstacle when exposing TernFS as a 'normal' filesystem is that TernFS files are immutable. More specifically, TernFS files are fully written before being 'linked' into the filesystem as a directory entry. This is intentional: it lets us cleanly separate the API for 'under construction' files and 'completed files', and it means that half-written files are not visible.</p>
<p>However this design is essentially incompatible with POSIX, which endows the user with near-absolute freedom when it comes to manipulating a file. Therefore, the TernFS kernel module is <em>not</em> POSIX-compliant, but rather exposes enough POSIX to allow many programs to work without modifications, but not all.</p>
<p>In practice this means that programs which write files left-to-right and never modify the files' contents will work out-of-the-box. While this might seem very restrictive, we found that a surprising number of programs worked just fine.<sup><a href="#f12">[12]</a></sup> Programs that did not follow this pattern were modified to first write to a temporary file and then copy the finished file to TernFS.</p>

<p>While we feel that writing our own kernel module was the right approach, it proved to be the trickiest part of TernFS, and we would not have been able to implement it without <a href="#block-proofs">some important safety checks</a> in the TernFS core services.<sup><a href="#f13">[13]</a></sup></p>

<h4>S3 gateway</h4>
<p>Almost all the storage-related activity at XTX is due to our machine-learning efforts, and for those purposes the TernFS' kernel module has served us well. However, as TernFS proved itself there, we started to look into offering TernFS to the broader firm.</p>
<p>Doing so through the kernel module presented multiple challenges. For starters installing a custom kernel module on every machine that needed to reach TernFS is operationally cumbersome. Moreover, while all machine-learning happens in clusters housed in the same data centre as TernFS itself, we wanted to expose TernFS in a way that's more amenable to less local networks, for instance by removing the need for UDP. Finally, TernFS does not have any built-in support for permissions or authentication, which is a requirement in multi-tenant scenarios.</p>
<p>To solve all these problems, we implemented a gateway for TernFS, which exposes a TernFS subtree using the S3 API. The gateway is a simple Go process turning S3 calls into TernFS API calls. The S3 gateway is not currently open sourced since it is coupled to authentication services internal to XTX, but we have open sourced a minimal S3 gateway to serve as a starting point for third-party contributors to build their own.</p>
<p>We've also planned an NFS gateway to TernFS, but we haven't had a pressing enough need yet to complete it.</p>

<h4>The web UI and the JSON interface</h4>
<p>Finally, a view of TernFS is provided by its web UI. The web UI is a stateless Go program which exposes most of the state of TernFS in an easy-to-use interface. This state includes the full filesystem contents (both metadata and file contents), the status of each service including information about decommissioned block services, and so on.</p>
<p>Moreover, the web UI also exposes the <a href="#speaking-ternfs">direct TernFS API</a> in JSON form, which is very useful for small scripts and curl-style automation that does not warrant a full-blown Go program.</p>

<h3>Directory Policies</h3>
<p>To implement some of the functionality we'll describe below, TernFS adopts a system of per-directory policies.</p>
<p>Policies are used for all sorts of decisions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#reed-solomon">How to redundantly store files.</a></li>
<li><a href="#drive-type-picking">On which type of drive to store files.</a></li>
<li><a href="#snapshots">How long to keep files around after deletion.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the topics above (and a few more we haven't mentioned) correspond to a certain policy <em>tag</em>. The body of the policies are stored in the metadata together with the other directory attributes.</p>
<p>Policies are inherited: if a directory does not contain a certain policy tag, it transitively inherits from the parent directory. TernFS clients store a cache of policies to allow for traversal-free policy lookup for most directories.</p>
<h3>Keeping blocks in check</h3>
<p>A filesystem is no good if it loses, leaks, corrupts, or otherwise messes up its data. TernFS deploys a host of measures to minimize the chance of anything going wrong. So far, these have worked: we've never lost data in our production deployment of TernFS. This section focuses on the measures in place to specifically safeguard files' blocks.</p>
<h4>Against bitrot, or CRC32-C</h4>
<p>The first and possibly most obvious measure consists of aggressively checksumming all TernFS' data. The metadata is automatically checksummed by RocksDB, and every block is stored in a format interleaving 4KiB pages with 4byte CRC32-C checksums.</p>
<p>CRC32-C was picked since it is a high-quality checksum and implemented on most modern silicon.<sup><a href="#f14">[14]</a></sup> It also exhibits some desirable properties when used together with <a href="#block-proofs">Reed-Solomon coding</a>.</p>

<p>4KiB was picked since it is the read boundary used by Linux filesystems and is fine-grained while still being large enough to render the storage overhead of the 4byte checksums negligible.</p>
<p>Interleaving the CRCs with the block contents does not add any safety, but it does improve operations in two important ways. First, it allows for safe partial reads: clients can demand only a few pages from a block which is many megabytes in size and still check the reads against its checksum. Second, it allows <a href="#scrubbing">scrubbing</a> files locally on the server which hosts the blocks, without communicating with other services at all.</p>

<h4>Storing files redundantly, or Reed-Solomon codes</h4>
<p>We've been talking about files being split into blocks, but we haven't really explained <em>how</em> files become blocks.</p>
<p>The first thing we do to a file is split it into <em>spans</em>. Spans are at most 100MiB and are present just to divide files into sections of a manageable size.</p>
<p>Then each span is divided into D <em>data blocks</em>, and P <em>parity blocks</em>. D and P are determined by the corresponding <a href="#directory-policies">directory policy</a> in which the file is created. When D is 1, the entire contents of the span become a single block, and that block is stored D+P times. This scheme is equivalent to a simple mirroring scheme and allows it to lose up to P blocks before losing file data.</p>
<p>While wasteful, mirroring the entire contents of the file can be useful for very hot files, since TernFS clients will pick a block at random to read from, thereby sharing the read load across many block services. And naturally files which we do not care much for can be stored with D = 1 and P = 0, without any redundancy.</p>
<p>That said, most files will not be stored using mirroring but rather using Reed-Solomon coding. Other resources can be consulted to understand the <a href="https://mazzo.li/posts/reed-solomon.html">high-level idea</a> and the <a href="https://www.corsix.org/content/reed-solomon-for-software-raid">low-level details</a> of Reed-Solomon coding, but the gist is it allows us to split a span into D equally sized blocks (some padding might be necessary), and then generate P blocks of equal size such that up to any P blocks can be lost while retaining the ability to reconstruct all the other blocks.</p>
<p>As mentioned, D and P are fully configurable, but at XTX we tend to use D = 10 and P = 4, which allows us to lose up to any four drives for any file.</p>

<h4>Drive type picking</h4>
<p>We now know how to split files into a bunch of blocks. The next question is: which drives to pick to store the blocks on. The first decision is which kind of drive to use. At XTX we separate drives into two broad categories for this purpose ‚Äî flash and spinning disks.</p>
<p>When picking between these two, we want to balance two needs: minimizing the cost of hardware by utilizing hard disks if we can <sup><a href="#f15">[15]</a></sup>, and maximizing hard disk productivity by having them reading data most of the time, rather than seeking.</p>

<p>To achieve that, directory policies offer a way to tune how large each block will be, and to tune which drives will be picked based on block size. This allows us to configure TernFS so that larger files that can be read sequentially are stored on hard disks, while random-access or small files are stored on flash. <sup><a href="#f16">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>Currently this system is not adaptive, but we found that in practice it's easy to carve out sections of the filesystem which are not read sequentially. We have a default configuration which assumes sequential reads and then uses hard disks down to roughly 2.5MB blocks, below which hard disks stop being productive enough and blocks start needing to be written to flash. <a name="block-service-picking"></a></p>
<h4>Block service picking</h4>
<p>OK, we now know what type of drive to select for our files, but we still have tens of thousands of individual drives to pick from. Picking the 'right' individual drive requires some sophistication.</p>
<p>The first thing to note is that drive failures or unavailability are often correlated. For instance, at XTX a single server handles 102 spinning disks. If the server is down, faulty, or needs to be decommissioned, it'll render its 102 disks temporarily or permanently unavailable.</p>
<p>It's therefore wise to spread a file's blocks across many servers. To achieve this, each TernFS block service (which generally corresponds to a single drive) has a <em>failure domain</em>. When picking block services in which to store the blocks for a given file, TernFS will make sure that each block is in a separate failure domain. In our TernFS deployment a failure domain corresponds to a server, but other users might wish to tie it to some other factor as appropriate.</p>
<p>TernFS also tries hard to avoid write bottlenecks by spreading the current write load across many disks. Moreover, since new drives can be added at any time, it tries to converge to a situation where each drive is roughly equally filled by assigning writing more to drives with more available space.</p>
<p>Mechanically this is achieved by having each shard periodically request a set of block services to use for writing from the registry. When handing out block services to shards, the registry selects block services according to several constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>It never gives block services from the same failure domain to the same shard</li>
<li>It minimizes the variance in how many shards each block service is currently assigned to</li>
<li>It prioritizes block services which have more available space.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then when a client wants to write a new span, requiring D+P blocks, the shard simply selects D+P block services randomly amongst the ones it last received from the registry.</p>
<p>One concept currently absent from TernFS is what is often known as 'copyset replication'. When assigning disks to files at random (even with the caveat of failure domains) the probability of rendering at least one file unreadable quickly becomes a certainty as more and more drives fail:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.xtxmarkets.com/assets/tech/2025-ternfs-faileddisks.png" alt="Probability of data loss vs Failed disks" title="Probability of data loss vs Failed disks"></p>

<p>Copysets reduce the likelihood of data loss occurring by choosing blocks out of a limited number of sets of drives, as opposed to picking the drives randomly. This dramatically reduces the probability of data loss<sup><a href="#f17">[17]</a></sup>.  They are generally a good idea, but we haven't found them to be worthwhile, for a few reasons.</p>

<p>First, evacuating a 20TB drive takes just a few minutes, and in the presence of multiple failed drives the migrator process evacuates first the files which are present in multiple failed drives to get ahead of possible data loss. This means that for TernFS to lose data within a single data centre tens of drives would have to fail within a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>More importantly, our TernFS deployment is replicated across three data centres. This replication eliminates the chance of losing data due to 'independent' drive failures ‚Äî thousands of drives would need to fail at once. Obviously, data centre wide events <em>can</em> cause a large proportion of the drives within it to fail, but having such an event in three data centres at once is exceedingly unlikely.</p>
<p>Finally, copysets are not without drawbacks or complications. Assigning drives at random is an optimal strategy when it comes to evacuating drives quickly, since the files with blocks in the drives to be evacuated will be evenly spread over the rest of the filesystem, and since we only ever need to replace the failed blocks given that we're not constrained by fitting the new set of blocks in predetermined copysets. This means that the evacuation procedure will not be bottlenecked by drive throughput, which is what enables evacuation to finish in a matter of minutes. Moreover, the algorithm to distribute drives to shards is significantly simpler and more flexible than if it needed to care about copysets.</p>
<p>However, users that wish to deploy TernFS within a single data centre might wish to implement some form of copyset replication. Such a change would be entirely contained to the registry and would not change any other component.</p>

<h4>Block Proofs</h4>
<p>We now have a solid scheme to store files redundantly (thanks to Reed-Solomon codes) and protect against bitrot (thanks to the checksums). However, said schemes are only as good as their implementation.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, TernFS clients communicate their intention to write a file to metadata servers, the metadata servers select block services that the blocks should be written to, and the clients then write the blocks to block services independently of the metadata services. The same happens when a client wants to erase blocks: the client first communicates its intentions to delete the blocks to the right metadata shard and then performs the erasing itself.</p>
<p>This poses a challenge. While verifying the correctness of the core TernFS services is feasible, verifying all clients is not, but we'd still like to prevent buggy clients from breaking key invariants of the filesystem.</p>
<p>Buggy clients can wreak havoc in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can <em>leak data</em> by writing blocks to block services that are not referenced anywhere in the metadata.</li>
<li>They can <em>lose data</em> by erasing blocks which are still referenced in metadata.</li>
<li>They can <em>corrupt data</em> by telling the metadata services they'll write something and then writing something else.</li>
</ul>
<p>We address all these points by using what we call <em>block proofs</em>. To illustrate how block proofs work, it's helpful to go through the steps required to write new data to a file.</p>
<ol>
<li>When a client is creating a file, it'll do so by adding its <a href="#reed-solomon">file spans</a> one-by-one. For each span the client wants to add it sends an 'initiate span creation' request to the right metadata shard. This request contains both the overall checksum of the span, and the checksum of each block in it (including parity blocks).</li>
<li>The metadata shard checks the consistency of the checksum of the span and of its blocks, something it can do thanks to <a href="https://mazzo.li/posts/rs-crc.html">some desirable mathematical properties</a> of CRCs.</li>
<li>The shard picks block services for the blocks to be written in and returns this information to the client together with a signature for each 'block write' instruction.</li>
<li>The client forwards this signature to the block services, which will refuse to write the block without it. Crucially, the cryptographic signature ranges over a unique identity for the block (ensuring we only write the block we mean to write), together with its checksum, ensuring we don't write the wrong data.<sup><a href="#f18">[18]</a></sup></li>
<li>After committing the block to disk, the block service returns a 'block written' signature to the client.</li>
<li>Finally, the client forwards the block written signature back to the shard, which certifies that the span has been written only when it has received the signatures for all the blocks that make up the span. <sup><a href="#f19">[19]</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>Similarly, when a client wants to delete a span, it first asks the metadata shard to start doing so. The metadata shard marks the span as 'in deletion' and returns a bunch of 'block erase' signatures to the client. The client then forwards the signatures to the block services that hold the blocks, which delete the blocks, and return a 'block erased' signature. The clients forward these signatures back to the metadata shards, which can then forget about the span entirely.</p>

<p>We use AES to generate the signatures for simplicity but note that the goal here is not protecting ourselves from malicious clients ‚Äî just buggy ones. The keys used for the signature are not kept secret, and CRC32-C is not a secure checksum. That said, we've found this scheme enormously valuable in the presence of <a href="#posix-shaped">complex clients</a>. We spent considerable efforts making the core services very simple so we could then take more implementation risks in the clients, with the knowledge that we would have a very low chance of corrupting the filesystem itself.</p>

<h4>Scrubbing</h4>
<p>Finally, if things go wrong, we need to notice. The most common failure mode for a drive is for it to fail entirely, in which case our internal hardware monitoring system will pick it up and migrate from it automatically. The more insidious (and still very common) case is a single sector failing in a drive, which will only be noticed when we try to read the block involving that sector.</p>
<p>This is acceptable for files which are read frequently, but some files might be very 'cold' but still very important.</p>
<p>Consider the case of raw market data taps which are immediately converted to some processed, lossy format. While we generally will use the file containing the processed data, it's paramount to store the raw market data forever so that if we ever want to include more information from the original market data, we can. So important cold files might go months or even years without anyone reading them, and in the meantime, we might find that enough blocks have been corrupted to render them unreadable.<sup><a href="#f20">[20]</a></sup></p>

<p>To make sure this does not happen, a process called the <em>scrubber</em> continuously reads every block that TernFS stores, and replaces blocks with bad sectors before they can cause too much damage.</p>

<h3>Snapshots and garbage collection</h3>
<p>We've talked at length about what TernFS does to try to prevent data loss due to hardware failure or bugs in clients. However, the most common type of data loss is due to human error ‚Äî the <code>rm ‚Äîrf / home/alice/notes.txt</code> scenario.</p>
<p>To protect against these scenarios, TernFS implements a lightweight snapshotting system. When files or directories are deleted, their contents aren't actually deleted. Instead, a weak reference to them is created. We call such weak references <em>snapshot</em> directory entries.</p>
<p>Snapshot entries are not be visible through the kernel module or the S3 gateway, but are visible through <a href="#speaking-ternfs">the direct API</a>, and at XTX we have developed internal tooling to easily recover deleted files through it.<sup><a href="#f21">[21]</a></sup> Deleted files are also visible through the TernFS web UI.</p>

<p>Given that 'normal' file operations do not delete files, but rather make them a snapshot, the task of freeing up space is delegated to an external Go process, the <em>garbage collector</em>. The garbage collector traverses the filesystem and removes expired snapshots, which involves deleting their blocks permanently. Snapshot expiry is predictably regulated by <a href="#directory-policies">directory policies</a>.</p>
<h3>Keeping TernFS healthy</h3>
<p>This last section covers how we (humans of XTX) notice problems in TernFS, and how TernFS self-heals when things go wrong ‚Äî both key topics if we want to ensure no data loss and notice performance problems early.</p>
<h4>Performance metrics</h4>
<p>TernFS exposes a plethora of performance metrics through the HTTP <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2/reference/syntax/line-protocol/">InfluxDB line protocol</a>. While connecting TernFS to a service which ingests these metrics is optional, it is <em>highly</em> recommended for any production service.</p>
<p>Moreover, the kernel module exposes many performance metrics itself through DebugFS.</p>
<p>Both types of metrics, especially when used in tandem, have proved invaluable to resolve performance problems quickly.</p>
<h4>Logging and alerts</h4>
<p>TernFS services log their output to files in a simple line-based format. The internal logging API is extremely simple and includes support for syslog levels out-of-the-box. At XTX we run TernFS as normal systemd services and use journalctl to view logs.</p>
<p>As with metrics, the kernel module includes various logging facilities as well. The first type of logging is just through dmesg, but the kernel module also includes numerous tracepoints for low-overhead opt-in logging of many operations.</p>
<p>TernFS is also integrated with XTX's internal alerting system, called <em>XMon</em>, to page on call developers when things go wrong. XMon is not open source, but all the alerts are also rendered as error lines in logs. <sup><a href="#f22">[22]</a></sup> We plan to eventually move to having alerts feed off performance metrics, which would make them independent from XMon, although we don't have plans to do so in the short-term. <a name="migrations"></a></p>

<h4>Migrations</h4>
<p>Finally, there's the question of what to do when drives die ‚Äî and they will die, frequently, when you have 50,000 of them. While drives dying is not surprising, we've been surprised at the variety of different drive failures. <sup><a href="#f23">[23]</a></sup> A malfunctioning drive might:</p>

<ul>
<li>Produce IO errors when reading specific files. This is probably due to a single bad sector.</li>
<li>Produce IO errors when reading or writing anything. This might happen because enough bad sectors have gone bad and the drive cannot remap them, or for a variety of other reasons.</li>
<li>Return wrong data. This is usually caught by the built-in error correction codes in the hard drives, but not always.</li>
<li>Lie about data being successfully persisted. This can manifest in a variety of ways: file size being wrong on open, file contents being partially zero'd out, and so on.</li>
<li>Disappear from the mount list, only to reappear when the machine is rebooted, but missing some data.</li>
</ul>
<p>When clients fail to read from a drive, they'll automatically fall back on other drives to reconstruct the missing data, which is extremely effective in hiding failures from the end-user. That said, something needs to be done about the bad drives, and <a href="#block-service-picking">done quickly to avoid permanent data loss</a>.</p>
<p>The TernFS registry allows marking drives as faulty. Faulty drives are then picked up by the <em>migrator</em>, a Go process which waits for bad drives and then stores all its blocks onto freshly picked block services.</p>
<p>TernFS also tries to mark drives as bad automatically using a simple heuristic based on the rate of IO errors the drive is experiencing. The number of drives automatically marked as faulty is throttled to avoid having this check go awry and mark the whole cluster as faulty, which would not be catastrophic but would still be messy to deal with.</p>
<p>Moreover, drives that are faulty in subtle ways might not be picked up by the heuristics, which means that occasionally a sysadmin will need to mark a drive as faulty manually, after which the migrator will evacuate them.</p>
<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>At XTX we feel strongly about utilizing our resources efficiently. When it comes to software, this means having software that gets close to some theoretical optimum when it comes to total cost of ownership. This culture was borne out by competing hard for technological excellence when doing on-exchange trading at first, and by our ever-growing hardware costs as our business has grown later.</p>
<p>Such idealized tools might not exist or be available yet, in which case we're happy to be the tool makers. TernFS is a perfect example of this and we're excited to open source this component of our business for the community.</p>
<p>Crucially, the cost of implementation of a new solution is often overblown compared to the cost of tying yourself to an ill-fitting, expensive third-party solution. Designing and implementing a solution serving exactly your needs allows for much greater simplicity. If the requirements do change, as often happens, changes can be implemented very quickly, again only catering to your needs.</p>
<p>That said, we believe that TernFS' set of trade-offs are widely shared across many organizations dealing with large-scale storage workloads, and we hope we'll contribute to <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">at least slowing down the seemingly constant stream of new filesystems</a>.</p>

Other affected platforms around the world included Wordle, Coinbase, Duolingo, Slack, Pok√©mon Go, Epic Games, PlayStation Network and Peloton.</p><p>By 10.30am UK time, Amazon was reporting that the problem, which first emerged at about 8am, was being resolved as AWS was ‚Äúseeing significant signs of recovery‚Äù.</p><p>However, after reporting further positive progress by late morning in the UK, Amazon still appeared to be struggling to overcome the glitch this afternoon as it acknowledged it was still experiencing elevated errors.</p><p>‚ÄúWe can confirm significant API errors and connectivity issues across multiple services ‚Ä¶ We are investigating,‚Äù AWS said in an update around 7am Pacific time and 3pm UK time.</p><p>To aid the recovery, AWS said it was putting in place limits on the number of requests that could be made on its platform.</p><p>Experts said the outage underlined the dangers of the internet‚Äôs reliance on a small number of tech companies, with Amazon, Microsoft and Google playing a key role in the cloud market.</p><p>Dr Corinne Cath-Speth, the head of digital at human rights organisation Article 19, said: ‚ÄúWe urgently need diversification in cloud computing.

This development‚Äîwhich may typify Europe‚Äôs current approach to transatlantic intelligence-sharing‚Äîwas confirmed last week by the heads of the Netherlands‚Äô two largest intelligence agencies in a joint <a title="H. MODDERKOLK &quot;Nederlandse diensten delen minder informatie met de VS - ‚ÄòSoms vertellen we dingen niet meer‚Äô&quot; De Volkskrant [18oct2025]" href="https://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/nederlandse-diensten-delen-minder-informatie-met-de-vs-soms-vertellen-we-dingen-niet-meer~b4882f19/">interview</a> with <em>De Volkskrant</em> newspaper.</p>
<p>The joint interview was given to <em>De Volkskrant</em> by Erik Akerboom, director of the General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD), and Peter Reesink , director of the General Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD)‚ÄîAIVD‚Äôs civilian counterpart.</p>
<p>Both men stressed that inter-agency relations between Dutch and American intelligence organizations remain ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù. However, they added that the Netherlands has grown more selective about what it chooses to share with American intelligence agencies‚Äîparticularly the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency. ‚ÄúThat we sometimes don‚Äôt share things anymore, that‚Äôs true,‚Äù Reesink said, referring to sharing information with American intelligence agencies. Akerboom added: ‚Äúsometimes you have to think case by case.‚Äù He went on to say: ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt say what we will or won‚Äôt share. But we can say that we are more critical.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to the two senior officials, Dutch spies have been intensifying intelligence cooperation and sharing with their European counterparts. This is particularly applicable to a collection of central and northern European intelligence services from countries like Scandinavia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Poland, according to <em>De Volkskrant</em>.</p>

He would regularly destroy the top of the crop in online chess, and would do so while showing emotion, entertaining viewers, and making humble content for beginners.</p>

<p>To be completely honest, I was first attracted to his streams by his fits of rage on stream... partly because they were funny, but partly also because it was relatable, and "normalized" a chess GM. Once he said he got control of it, his content got even better, and I noticed that he quickly became not just the biggest Chess streamer (I'm certain he was for several years), but one of the biggest streamers on Twitch. Like, he went from a "uni kid" raging for slipping pieces etc during games in between uni-classes, to netting $100k+/month streaming and being positive. And on top of displaying the highest level of chess on streams, he would, like I said, make beginner content, commentate tournaments, etc.</p>

<p>Never did he shill any crappy products (or far below that, like unregulated gamba, like some of the other top GM's like Hikaru), and never did it seem like any of his success got to his head. He didn't "minmax" his streams by only focusing on drama or whatever would from time to time boost Chess interest. He always did what originally got people interested in him, and what he actually wanted to do.</p>

<p>I don't know the details, but I'd be shocked if this <em>wasn't</em> suicide. Something just tells me that it was, everything into consideration. It's just so sad. The world has truly lost out on a great person, a great influencer (if you can even believe those can exist in today's world), and for chess, an irreplicable asset.</p>

<p>I've been watching Danya ever since his days at Stanford streaming from his dorm and classrooms. Very bright, had every door open back then.</p>

<p>He always had some minor mental health issues (e.g. destroying objects, raging really hard) and was staying up super late every night, but nothing unusual for other gamers too, to be fair. People found his antics funny, his chat was memeing mostly.</p>

<p>Really hard to tell what happened. Something must've derailed really badly. Probably something personal, not even connected to chess or his career.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.abdellatif.io/production-rag-processing-5m-documents">https://blog.abdellatif.io/production-rag-processing-5m-documents</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45645349">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>October 20, 2025<!-- --> ‚Ä¢ <!-- -->3 min read</p><article><p>I've spent the last 8 months in the RAG trenches, I want to share what actually worked vs. wasted our time. We built RAG for Usul AI (9M pages) and an unnamed legal AI enterprise (4M pages).</p>
<h2 id="langchain-llamaindex"><a href="#langchain-llamaindex"></a>Langchain + Llamaindex</h2>
<p>We started out with youtube tutorials. First Langchain ‚Üí Llamaindex. Got to a working prototype in a couple of days and were optimistic with the progress. We run tests on subset of the data (100 documents) and the results looked great. We spent the next few days running the pipeline on the production dataset and got everything working in a week ‚Äî incredible.</p>
<p>Except it wasn't, the results were subpar and only the end users could tell. We spent the following few months rewriting pieces of the system, one at a time, until the performance was at the level we wanted. Here are things we did ranked by ROI.</p>
<h2 id="what-moved-the-needle"><a href="#what-moved-the-needle"></a>What moved the needle</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Query Generation</strong>: not all context can be captured by the user's last query. We had an LLM review the thread and generate a number of semantic + keyword queries. We processed all of those queries in parallel, and passed them to a reranker. This made us cover a larger surface area and not be dependent on a computed score for hybrid search.</li>
<li><strong>Reranking</strong>: the highest value 5 lines of code you'll add. The chunk ranking shifted <em>a lot</em>. More than you'd expect. Reranking can many times make up for a bad setup if you pass in enough chunks. We found the ideal reranker set-up to be 50 chunk input -&gt; 15 output.</li>
<li><strong>Chunking Strategy</strong>: this takes a lot of effort, you'll probably be spending most of your time on it. We built a custom flow for both enterprises, make sure to understand the data, review the chunks, and check that a) chunks are not getting cut mid-word or sentence b) ~each chunk is a logical unit and captures information on its own</li>
<li><strong>Metadata to LLM</strong>: we started by passing the chunk text to the LLM, we ran an experiment and found that injecting relevant metadata as well (title, author, etc.) improves context and answers by a lot.</li>
<li><strong>Query routing</strong>: many users asked questions that can't be answered by RAG (e.g. summarize the article, who wrote this). We created a small router that detects these questions and answers them using an API call + LLM instead of the full-blown RAG set-ups.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="our-stack"><a href="#our-stack"></a>Our stack</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vector database</strong>: Azure -&gt; Pinecone -&gt; Turbopuffer (cheap, supports keyword search natively)</li>
<li><strong>Document Extraction</strong>: Custom</li>
<li><strong>Chunking</strong>: Unstructured.io by default, custom for enterprises (heard that Chonkie is good)</li>
<li><strong>Embedding</strong>: text-embedding-large-3, haven't tested others</li>
<li><strong>Reranker</strong>: None -&gt; Cohere 3.5 -&gt; Zerank (less known but actually good)</li>
<li><strong>LLM</strong>: GPT 4.1 -&gt; GPT 5 -&gt; GPT 4.1, covered by Azure credits</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="going-open-source"><a href="#going-open-source"></a>Going Open-source</h2>
<p>We put all our learning into an open-source project: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/agentset-ai/agentset">agentset-ai/agentset</a> under an MIT license.

This information provides a revealing ‚Äî though incomplete ‚Äî insight into the costs of running Anthropic and Cursor, but does not include other costs, like salaries and compute obtained from other providers. I cannot tell you (and do not have insight into) Anthropic‚Äôs actual private moves. Any conclusions or speculation I make in this article will be based on my interpretations of the information I‚Äôve received, as well as other publicly-available information.</li><li>I have used estimates of Anthropic‚Äôs revenue based on reporting across the last ten months. Any estimates I make are detailed and they are brief.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>These costs are inclusive of every product bought on Amazon Web Services, including EC2, storage and database services (as well as literally everything else they pay for).</strong></li><li>Anthropic works with both Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud for compute. I do not have any information about its Google Cloud spend.<ul><li>The reason I bring this up is that Anthropic‚Äôs revenue is already being eaten up by its AWS spend. It‚Äôs likely billions <em>more</em> in the hole from Google Cloud and other operational expenses.</li></ul></li><li>I have confirmed with sources that every single number I give around Anthropic and Cursor‚Äôs AWS spend is <strong>the final cash paid to Amazon after any discounts or credits.</strong></li><li>While I cannot disclose the identity of my source, I am 100% confident in these numbers, and have verified their veracity with other sources. </li></ul><h2 id="anthropic%E2%80%99s-compute-costs-are-likely-much-higher-than-reported-%E2%80%94-135-billion-in-2024-on-aws-alone">Anthropic‚Äôs Compute Costs Are Likely Much Higher Than Reported ‚Äî $1.35 Billion in 2024 on AWS Alone</h2><p>In February of this year, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anthropic-projects-soaring-growth-to-34-5-billion-in-2027-revenue?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>The information reported</u></a> that Anthropic burned $5.6 billion in 2024, and made somewhere between $400 million and $600 million in revenue:</p><blockquote>It‚Äôs not publicly known how much revenue Anthropic generated in 2024, although its monthly revenue rose to about $80 million by the end of the year, compared to around $8 million at the start. That suggests full-year revenue in the $400 million to $600 million range.<p>‚Ä¶Anthropic told investors it expects to burn $3 billion this year, substantially less than last year, when it burned $5.6 billion. Last year‚Äôs cash burn was nearly $3 billion more than Anthropic had previously projected. That‚Äôs likely due to the fact that more than half of the cash burn came from a one-off payment to access the data centers that power its technology, according to one of the people who viewed the pitch.</p></blockquote><p>While I don‚Äôt know about prepayment for services, I can confirm from a source with direct knowledge of billing that Anthropic spent $1.35 billion on Amazon Web Services in 2024, and has already spent $2.66 billion on Amazon Web Services through the end of September.</p><p>Assuming that Anthropic made $600 million in revenue, this means that Anthropic spent $6.2 billion in 2024, leaving $4.85 billion in costs unaccounted for.&nbsp;</p><p>The Information‚Äôs piece also brings up another point:</p><blockquote>The costs to develop AI models accounted for a major portion of Anthropic‚Äôs expenses last year. The company spent $1.5 billion on servers for training AI models. OpenAI was on track to spend as much as $3 billion on training costs last year, though that figure includes additional expenses like paying for data.</blockquote><p>Before I go any further, I want to be clear that The Information‚Äôs reporting is sound, and I trust that their source (I have no idea who they are or what information was provided) was operating in good faith with good data. </p><p>However, Anthropic is telling people it spent $1.5 billion on <em>just</em> training when it has an Amazon Web Services bill of $1.35 billion, which heavily suggests that its actual compute costs are significantly higher than we thought, because, to quote SemiAnalysis, ‚Äú<a href="https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/amazons-ai-resurgence-aws-anthropics-multi-gigawatt-trainium-expansion?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=A%20large%20share%20of%20Anthropic%E2%80%99s%20spending%20is%20going%20to%20Google%20Cloud%20%E2%80%93%20one%20of%20Anthropic%E2%80%99s%20first%20major%20investors%20(%24300M%20round%20late%2D2022)%20and%20preferred%20cloud%20partner%20in%202023%20and%202024%2C%20before%20the%20expanded%20AWS%20deal."><u>a large share of Anthropic‚Äôs spending is going to Google Cloud</u></a>.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>I am guessing, because I do not know, but with $4.85 billion of other expenses to account for, it‚Äôs reasonable to believe Anthropic spent an amount similar to its AWS spend on Google Cloud.

Per the service tier page, Anthropic charges 1.25 for every time you write a token to the cache with a 5 minute TTL ‚Äî or 2 tokens if you have a 1 hour TTL ‚Äî and a longer cache is effectively essential for any background task where an agent will be working for more than 5 minutes, such as restructuring a particularly complex series of code, you know, the exact things that Cursor is well-known and marketed to do. </p><p>Furthermore, the longer something is in the cache, the better autocomplete suggestions for your code will be.

Great news! Turns out it‚Äôd need to start handing a lot of that to Anthropic.</li><li>This was, as I‚Äôve discussed above, the month when Anthropic forced it to adopt ‚ÄúService Tiers‚Äù.<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-is-a-money-trap/#cursor-is-a-systemic-risk-to-the-ai-industry"><u> I go into detail about the situation here</u></a>, but the long and short of it is that Anthropic increased the amount of tokens you burned by writing stuff to the cache (think of it like RAM in a computer), and AI coding startups are very cache heavy, meaning that Cursor immediately took on what I believed would be massive new costs. As I discuss in what I just linked, this led Cursor to aggressively change its product, thereby vastly increasing its customers‚Äô costs if they wanted to use the same service.</li><li>That same month, Cursor‚Äôs AWS costs ‚Äî which I believe are the <em>minority</em> of its cloud compute costs ‚Äî exploded by 104% (or by $6.48 million), and never returned to their previous levels.</li><li>It‚Äôs conceivable that this surge is due to the compute-heavy nature of the latest Claude 4 models released that month ‚Äî or, perhaps, Cursor sending more of its users to other models that it runs on Bedrock.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>July 2025 - $15.5 million<ul><li>As you can see, Cursor‚Äôs costs continue to balloon in July, and I am guessing it‚Äôs because of the Service Tiers situation ‚Äî which, I believe, indirectly resulted in Cursor pushing more users to models that it runs on Amazon‚Äôs infrastructure.</li></ul></li><li>August 2025 - $9.67 million<ul><li>So, I can only guess as to why there was a drop here.

After all, <a href="https://openai.com/api-priority-processing/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>OpenAI already has its own priority processing product, which it launched shortly after Anthropic‚Äôs in June</u></a>.</p><p>The ultimate problem is that there really are no<em> winners</em> in this situation. If Anthropic kills Cursor through aggressive rent-seeking, that directly eats into its own revenues. If Anthropic lets Cursor succeed, that‚Äôs <em>revenue</em>, but it‚Äôs also clearly <em>unprofitable revenue</em>. Everybody loses, but nobody loses more than Cursor‚Äôs (and other AI companies‚Äô) customers.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="anthropic-is-in-real-troubleand-the-current-cost-of-doing-business-is-unsustainable-meaning-prices-must-increase">Anthropic Is In Real Trouble - And The Current Cost Of Doing Business Is Unsustainable, Meaning Prices Must Increase</h2><p>I‚Äôve come away from this piece with a feeling of dread.</p><p>Anthropic‚Äôs costs are out of control, and as things get more desperate, it appears to be lashing out at its customers, both companies like Cursor and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/28/anthropic-unveils-new-rate-limits-to-curb-claude-code-power-users/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Claude Code customers facing weekly rate limits on their more-powerful models</u></a> who are chided for using a product they pay for. Again, I cannot say for certain, but the spike in costs is clear, and it feels like more than a coincidence to me.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no period of time that I can see in the just under two years of data I‚Äôve been party to that suggests that Anthropic has any means of ‚Äî or any success doing ‚Äî cost-cutting, and the only thing this company seems capable of doing is increasing the amount of money it burns on a monthly basis.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on what I have been party to, the more successful Anthropic becomes, the more its services cost. <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/how-to-argue-with-an-ai-booster/#if-you-plotted-the-curve-of-how-the-cost-of-inference-has-been-falling-over-time-%E2%80%94-false-the-cost-of-inference-has-gone-up-over-time"><u>The cost of inference is clearly increasing for customers</u></a>, but based on its escalating monthly costs, the cost of inference appears to be high for Anthropic too, though it‚Äôs impossible to tell how much of its compute is based on training versus running inference.</p><p>In any case, these costs seem to increase with the amount of money Anthropic makes, meaning that the current pricing of both subscriptions and API access seems unprofitable, and must increase dramatically ‚Äî from my calculations, a 100% price increase might work, but good luck retaining every single customer and their customers too! ‚Äî for this company to ever become sustainable.&nbsp;</p><p>I don‚Äôt think that people would pay those prices.

<h3>Is this a Kickstarter?</h3>
<p>Not quite - this is an official Commodore¬Æ preorder with a money-back guarantee. Similar to crowdfunding, every penny goes into manufacturing first, and then to the mission to reboot Commodore itself. By skipping Kickstarter, we avoid big platform fees and pass the savings on to you - just like our founder Jack Tramiel would‚Äôve wanted.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Am I charged now or at shipping, and what currency?</h3>
<p>You‚Äôre charged now, in USD (your local currency shows until checkout). Like Kickstarter and others, your preorder funds production at the factory. The rest helps reboot the Commodore brand.</p>

<h3>Can I get a refund?</h3>
<p>Absolutely. You‚Äôre in control. Cancel anytime before shipping with our <strong>no quibble money-back guarantee</strong> for a full refund - no questions asked. Have an account? <a href="https://www.commodore.net/my-orders" target="_blank"><u>Cancel there</u></a> with one click. No account? Use our <a href="https://www.commodore.net/contact-us" target="_blank"><u>support form</u></a> and we‚Äôll sort it fast.</p>

<h3>How does shipping work?</h3>
<p>We deliver from Commodore &amp; Commodore partner hubs in the USA, UK, and EU (including our original 1980s Corby building). If you‚Äôre farther out, we ship via trusted couriers like DHL, FedEx, UPS, or Chickenlips Express.</p>

<h3>Will I pay sales tax?</h3>
<p>USA: Sales tax is added at checkout where required.</p>
<p>UK &amp; Europe: VAT/IVA/MwSt is added at checkout.</p>

<h3>What about tariffs?</h3>
<p>If your country charges import tariffs (e.g. the USA), you‚Äôll see a ‚ÄúTariff Tax‚Äù at checkout. This covers everything upfront, so there‚Äôs nothing more to pay later. We don‚Äôt control these fees, but we avoid surprises. If tariffs drop after you pay, we‚Äôll refund you at shipping. If they rise a lot before shipping, we may adjust- but only if truly needed to protect Commodore‚Äôs future.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>What about customs duties?</h3>
<p>We aim to prepay duties (DDP) where possible. In some places (e.g. Norway, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore), you might get a tax refund before shipping. Some countries may still charge customs fees on arrival - these aren‚Äôt included and as is commonplace, these are your responsibility.</p>

<h3>Isn't this just an emulator or rebadged something-or-other?</h3>
<p>The Commodore 64 Ultimate from the only original Commodore¬Æ brand (est. 1958) is brand new hardware-based Commodore 64 technology. It features SID chip-reactive LEDs (case, keyboard, power light*), the world's first transparent keyboard PCB*, original and modern creators‚Äô autographs etched in copper, and an updated FPGA that replicates the original C64 motherboard (not emulation). All customisable via a new, easy main menu. It‚Äôs a fully authentic new build from Commodore - who else?</p>
<p><em>*except beige version</em></p>

<h3>Will Commodore 64 Ultimate units still ship if the acquisition doesn‚Äôt complete?</h3>
<p>Good news - as of 31st July 2025 we paid the sellers in full, ahead of schedule, and signed the final contracts to complete the acquisition. Even before that, we had a contract guaranteeing these machines would be made no matter what.</p>

<h3>So what are the risks?</h3>
<p>All launches have some risk, whether you're Apple or Commodore. But this preorder is unusually safe. Most parts are already in production. The motherboard is a proven design. Cases shipped in January 2025. Keycaps shipped in 2024. Just a few parts remain, like the keyboard base, made by a trusted partner since the Apple II era. All components are pro-designed to fit together. Add the box, manual, and power supply, and we‚Äôre set.</p>

<h3>Is there a warranty?</h3>
<p>Yes. Our products include a 1-year limited warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship. For customers in the EU or UK, your purchase also complies with local consumer protection laws, including the EU Consumer Rights Directive and UK Consumer Rights Act, which provide additional rights. You can also add an extended warranty <a href="https://www.commodore.net/product-page/commodore-warranty" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.</p>

<h3>Can I email/DM you to suggest a feature change?</h3>
<p>We‚Äôre not planning hardware changes right now. Chances are we already debated it over chickenlips snacks. We‚Äôre reviewing ideas from our launch form and will reach out if your Commodore 256 Ultra-Turbo-CD-Lightgun-Keyring makes the cut.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://nathan.rs/posts/roberta-diffusion/">https://nathan.rs/posts/roberta-diffusion/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45644328">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img alt="Text Diffusion" src="https://nathan.rs/images/roberta-diffusion.gif"></p><p>A while back, Google DeepMind unveiled <a href="https://deepmind.google/models/gemini-diffusion/">Gemini Diffusion</a>, an experimental language model that generates text using diffusion. Unlike traditional GPT-style models that generate one word at a time, Gemini Diffusion creates whole blocks of text by refining random noise step-by-step.</p><p>I read the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09992">Large Language Diffusion Models</a> and was surprised to find that discrete language diffusion is just a generalization of masked language modeling (MLM), something we‚Äôve been doing since <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">2018</a>.
The first thought I had was, ‚Äúcan we finetune a BERT-like model to do text generation?‚Äù I decided to try a quick proof of concept out of curiosity.</p><blockquote><p>NOTE: After I wrote the article I stumbled upon the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15029">DiffusionBERT</a> which does essentially the same thing but with more rigorous testing! Check it out if this post interested you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="a-short-history-of-transformers">A Short History of Transformers<a href="#a-short-history-of-transformers">#</a></h2><hr><p>The original Transformer architecture, introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">2017</a>, was an encoder-decoder model. In 2018, researchers realized that the encoder and decoder components of the model could be separated (with the advent of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> and <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf">GPT</a>), and two distinct families of models were created:</p><ol><li><strong>Encoder-only models (BERT-style, bidirectional)</strong></li></ol><p>Encoder models used masked language modeling (MLM) as a training objective: randomly mask out a subset of tokens of each input and train the encoder to reconstruct the missing tokens (fill in the blanks).
The model sees the entire (partially masked) context at once and learns bidirectional representations.
This architecture excelled at tasks requiring a full‚Äêsentence (or paragraph) representation (e.g., classification and retrieval).</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Decoder-only models (GPT-style, autoregressive)</strong></li></ol><p>Decoder models used next‚Äêtoken prediction as a training objective: at each position $t$, predict the token at position $t + 1$ given all tokens up to $t$ as context. Only the left context is used to predict future values (unidirectional).
This architecture excelled at generative tasks where you produce text one token at a time, such as open‚Äêended generation, summarization, and translation.</p><p>Originally, BERT saw immediate use in tasks such as classification, whereas GPT-style models didn‚Äôt become popular until later (due to initial limited capabilities). Eventually, the generation capabilities of autoregressive (decoder) transformers vastly improved. The general training objective of ‚Äúnext token prediction‚Äù means a much larger space of use cases when compared to encoder models.</p><h2 id="discrete-language-diffusion-models">Discrete Language Diffusion Models<a href="#discrete-language-diffusion-models">#</a></h2><hr><p>Diffusion models were first popularized in image generation. In image generation, diffusion models gradually add Gaussian noise to an image (forward process) and then train a neural network to iteratively denoise it (reverse process). A high‚Äêlevel summary of continuous diffusion with images is:</p><ol><li><strong>Forward process</strong>: Start from a clean image <em>x‚ÇÄ</em>, then add small amounts of (usually Gaussian) noise at each timestep until you end up with near‚Äêpure noise.</li><li><strong>Reverse process</strong>: Train a model (often a U‚ÄêNet) to predict the noise at each timestep, gradually recovering the original image in discrete denoising steps.</li></ol><p>Applying this idea to language means we need a way to add noise to text and then remove it in stages.
The simplest way to do this is a <strong>masking‚Äêbased noise process</strong>:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Forward (masking) process</strong>:</p><ul><li>At timestep <em>t = 0</em>, you have a fully uncorrupted text sequence.</li><li>At each subsequent timestep <em>t &gt; 0</em>, randomly replace a fraction of tokens with a special <code>&lt;MASK&gt;</code> token according to a pre‚Äêdefined schedule (e.g., gradually increasing the masked proportion from 0% to 100%).</li><li>By the final timestep <em>T</em>, the entire sequence may be masked (all tokens are <code>&lt;MASK&gt;</code>).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Reverse (denoising) process</strong>:</p><ul><li>Train a model (often a standard Transformer encoder) to predict the original token IDs given a partially masked sequence at timestep <em>t</em>.</li><li>This is akin to performing masked language modeling at varying mask rates: at early timesteps, only a few tokens are masked (easy to predict); at later timesteps, many tokens are masked (harder).</li><li>By chaining together predictions from high‚Äêmask‚Äêrate back down to zero, you can recover (or generate) a full sequence.</li></ul></li></ol><p>In this discrete text diffusion framework, the model learns a likelihood bound on the data distribution by optimizing a sum of denoising losses over all timesteps, rather than a single MLM objective at a fixed mask probability.</p><p>As we can see, BERT‚Äôs masked language modeling objective is the <strong>same training objective as text diffusion, but just for a subset of masking rates</strong>.
By introducing variable masking rates (from 0 to 1) and a scheduled sequence of denoising steps (inspired by diffusion theory), we can transform BERT‚Äôs masked language modeling objective into a full generative procedure.</p><h2 id="roberta-diffusion">RoBERTa Diffusion<a href="#roberta-diffusion">#</a></h2><hr><p>In 2019, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692">RoBERTa</a> was released. It was essentially just an enhancement of the original BERT model, with better hyperparameters, data training size, and a more simple training objective (MLM only, removed next sentence prediction).</p><p>Here we use the HuggingFace <code>transformers</code> and <code>dataset</code> libraries to pull in the original RoBERTa weights, tokenizer, and the Trainer class to easily finetune the model on the WikiText dataset.

Critics of the legislation, which was later vetoed by California governor Gavin Newsom, argued it would hamper the development and release of open source AI models. Khan called for a less restrictive approach and said that, with open models available to them, ‚Äúsmaller players can bring their ideas to market.‚Äù</p><p>In the days leading up to the event, Khan‚Äôs staff published a blog on the agency‚Äôs website emphasizing similar talking points. The piece noted that ‚Äúopen source‚Äù had been used to describe AI models with a variety of different characteristics. The authors instead suggested adopting the term ‚Äúopen-weight,‚Äù meaning a model that has its <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-just-released-its-first-open-weight-models-since-gpt-2/">training weights</a> released publicly, allowing anyone to inspect, modify, or reuse it.</p><p>The Trump administration has since removed that blog post, two sources familiar with the matter tell WIRED.

In the original post, Khan‚Äôs staff had written that the agency was ‚Äúincreasingly taking note of AI‚Äôs potential for real-world instances of harm‚Äîfrom incentivizing commercial surveillance to enabling fraud and impersonation to perpetuating illegal discrimination.‚Äù</p><p>It‚Äôs not clear why the blog posts were removed from the internet.

<p id="caf228b5-5290-4a25-9b2c-43d6badcb8b3">Alibaba Cloud claims its new Aegaeon pooling system reduces the number of Nvidia GPUs required to serve large language models by 82% during a multi-month beta test inside its Model Studio marketplace. The result, published in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ennanzhai.github.io/pub/sosp25-aegaeon.pdf" target="_blank">peer-reviewed paper</a> presented at the 2025 ACM Symposium on Operating Systems (SOSP) in Seoul, suggests that cloud providers may be able to extract significantly more inference capacity from existing silicon, especially in constrained markets like China, where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/china-repurposes-used-nvidia-gpus" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/china-repurposes-used-nvidia-gpus">supply of Nvidia's latest H20s</a> remains limited.</p><p>Unlike training-time breakthroughs that chase model quality or speed, Aegaeon is an inference-time scheduler designed to maximize GPU utilization across many models with bursty or unpredictable demand. Instead of pinning one accelerator to one model, Aegaeon virtualizes GPU access at the token level, allowing it to schedule tiny slices of work across a shared pool. This means one H20 could serve several different models simultaneously, with system-wide ‚Äúgoodput‚Äù ‚Äî a measure of effective output ‚Äî rising by as much as nine times compared to older serverless systems.</p>

<p id="caf228b5-5290-4a25-9b2c-43d6badcb8b3-2">The system was tested in production over several months, according to the paper, which lists authors from both Peking University and Alibaba‚Äôs infrastructure division, including CTO Jingren Zhou. During that window, the number of GPUs needed to support dozens of different LLMs ‚Äî ranging in size up to 72 billion parameters ‚Äî fell from 1,192 to just 213.</p><p>While the paper does not break down which models contributed most to the savings, reporting by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3329450/alibaba-cloud-claims-slash-nvidia-gpu-use-82-new-pooling-system?module=top_story&amp;pgtype=section"><em>South China Morning Post</em></a><em> </em>says the tests were conducted using Nvidia‚Äôs H20, one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/jensen-huang-says-nvidia-china-market-share-has-fallen-to-zero" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/jensen-huang-says-nvidia-china-market-share-has-fallen-to-zero">few accelerators</a> still legally available to Chinese buyers under current U.S. export controls.</p><p>Whether those savings translate outside Alibaba‚Äôs stack remains to be seen. Alibaba Cloud‚Äôs paper does not specify the exact network fabric used in the beta test, but we know the company offers its own eRDMA elastic RDMA network and has a record of building highly‚Äëintegrated GPU serving stacks, suggesting the results may depend on an optimized, vertically integrated environment.</p>

Arnold said that US funding cuts to NGO budgets had made matters worse.</p><p>‚ÄúIt is quite clear that various organisations are starting to consider synthetic images instead of real photography, because it‚Äôs cheap and you don‚Äôt need to bother with consent and everything,‚Äù said Alenichev.</p><p>AI-generated images of extreme poverty now appear in their dozens on popular stock photo sites, including <a href="https://stock.adobe.com/uk/search/images?filters%5Bcontent_type%3Aphoto%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3Aillustration%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3Azip_vector%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3Avideo%5D=0&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3Atemplate%5D=0&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3A3d%5D=0&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3Aaudio%5D=0&amp;filters%5Binclude_stock_enterprise%5D=0&amp;filters%5Bis_editorial%5D=0&amp;filters%5Bfree_collection%5D=0&amp;filters%5Bcontent_type%3Aimage%5D=1&amp;filters%5Bgentech%5D=only&amp;k=poverty&amp;order=relevance&amp;price%5B%24%5D=1&amp;search_type=filter-select&amp;get_facets=1" data-link-name="in body link">Adobe Stock Photos</a> and <a href="https://www.freepik.com/search?ai=only&amp;format=search&amp;last_filter=ai&amp;last_value=only&amp;query=poverty" data-link-name="in body link">Freepik</a>, in response to queries such as ‚Äúpoverty‚Äù. Many bear captions such as ‚ÄúPhotorealistic kid in refugee camp‚Äù; ‚ÄúAsian children swim in a river full of waste‚Äù; and ‚ÄúCaucasian white volunteer provides medical consultation to young black children in African village‚Äù. Adobe sells licences to the last two photos in that list for about ¬£60.</p><p>‚ÄúThey are so racialised. They should never even let those be published because it‚Äôs like the worst stereotypes about Africa, or India, or you name it,‚Äù said Alenichev.</p><p>Joaqu√≠n Abela, CEO of Freepik, said the responsibility for using such extreme images lay with media consumers, and not with platforms such as his. The AI stock photos, he said, are generated by the platform‚Äôs global community of users, who can receive a licensing fee when Freepik‚Äôs customers choose to buy their images.</p><p>Freepik had attempted to curb biases it had found in other parts of its photo library, he said, by ‚Äúinjecting diversity‚Äù and trying to ensure gender balance into the photos of lawyers and CEOs hosted on the site.</p><p>But, he said, there was only so much his platform could do. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like trying to dry the ocean. We make an effort, but in reality, if customers worldwide want images a certain way, there is absolutely nothing that anyone can do.‚Äù</p><figure id="f83a4bc0-27e2-4585-8c83-b8dd6140dbc1" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4f9a6f4fa8474a2c2ac158c0745bdceab2c7ae0/5_0_2227_1211/master/2227.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4f9a6f4fa8474a2c2ac158c0745bdceab2c7ae0/5_0_2227_1211/master/2227.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4f9a6f4fa8474a2c2ac158c0745bdceab2c7ae0/5_0_2227_1211/master/2227.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4f9a6f4fa8474a2c2ac158c0745bdceab2c7ae0/5_0_2227_1211/master/2227.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4f9a6f4fa8474a2c2ac158c0745bdceab2c7ae0/5_0_2227_1211/master/2227.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4f9a6f4fa8474a2c2ac158c0745bdceab2c7ae0/5_0_2227_1211/master/2227.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A series of photographs showing black and brown-skinned people living in poverty in what appear to be refugee camps" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4f9a6f4fa8474a2c2ac158c0745bdceab2c7ae0/5_0_2227_1211/master/2227.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="241.98248765154915" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A screen grab showing AI-generated images of ‚Äòpoverty‚Äô on a stock photo site.

The outage was attributed to an "operational issue" affecting over 70 AWS services, causing widespread disruptions in cloud-based games and crypto exchanges like Coinbase. AWS reported signs of recovery shortly after the incident, but some services, such as Reddit, continued to experience issues.</p><p>The outage also impacted government websites like the UK's HMRC and various banking services, including Lloyds, Halifax, and the Bank of Scotland, leading to declined card transactions and inaccessible online banking. AWS identified the issue as related to DNS resolution in the US-EAST-1 region and worked on multiple paths to accelerate recovery.

<p>An open standard based on open source software, Matrix delivers the digital sovereignty, interoperability, resilience and security that governments need to transform the way they communicate; both within their own nation and across borders. These are the key benefits driving Matrix adoption.</p><p>The discussion between sessions, and in the evenings, had a consistent theme. Governments want communications that are:</p><p>1. <strong>Digitally sovereign</strong> - meaning end-user organisations have complete autonomy over their technology stack. Crucially, that means no vendor lock-in. That so many competing vendors sponsored and attended The Matrix Conference underlines the health of the Matrix ecosystem.</p><p>2. <strong>Interoperable</strong> - to both enable digital sovereignty and ensure that separate organisations can easily communicate with each other. The interoperability delivered by the Matrix open standard is absolutely crucial in enabling large-scale federated communications between multiple organisations.</p><p>3. <strong>Resilient</strong> - a decentralised communications network provides a far more robust communications architecture than a centralised network, which is paramount for government communications (as we write this blog post, Signal, Slack, Zoom and others are down due to their centralised design and a dependency on AWS).</p><p>4. <strong>Secure</strong> - end-to-end encryption is, of course, fundamental and viewed as ‚Äòtable stakes.‚Äô</p><p>European governments are rightly determined to control their own digital destiny, and are embracing Matrix as the foundation for real time communications. </p><p>Seeing the European Commission, France, FITKO, Germany, the German healthcare system, Luxembourg, NATO, Sweden, United Nations, ZenDiS and the European Space Agency all presenting on their Matrix deployments was just mindblowing! </p><p>Knowing how many other governments were also in attendance, soaking up insights and tips for their forthcoming Matrix projects, makes us really excited for a Matrix-based future that transforms cross-border collaboration and helps support a united, digitally sovereign Europe.</p><p>üëã See you all next year!</p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2025/10/1760698709884-1.jpeg" alt="Element's keynote at The Matrix Conference 2025" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/1760698709884-1.jpeg 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/1760698709884-1.jpeg 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2025/10/1760698709884-1.jpeg 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2025/10/1760698709884-1.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Element's keynote at The Matrix Conference 2025</span></figcaption></figure></div></div>]]></description>

<p>In early 2025, a family of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_beaver" title="Eurasian beaver">Eurasian beavers</a> (<i>Castor fiber</i>) naturally built a series of dams in the same locations where the human-planned infrastructure was intended.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The beavers used wood, mud, and stones to create structures that slowed water drainage and restored the wetland environment. This spontaneous restoration effort resulted in a thriving ecosystem, benefiting local wildlife such as rare stone crayfish, frogs, aquatic insects, and bird species dependent on wetland habitats.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_6-1"><a href="#cite_note-:3-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>In 2013 a family of beavers also slowed the time it takes for water upstream to travel to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winzer" title="Winzer">Winzer</a>, Germany from around 45 minutes to 20 days, according to Gerhard Shwab, a local beaver specialist,<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> which was estimated to have saved the local government ‚Ç¨<span><span data-sort-value="7004300000000000000‚ô†"></span>30<span>000</span></span>. 
</p><p>Experts noted that beavers are instinctive engineers capable of altering landscapes to support water retention and biodiversity. Their activities help regulate water flow, mitigate soil erosion, and improve water filtration, making them vital contributors to wetland health. The beaver-made dams in Brdy not only recreated a functioning wetland but also provided long-term benefits by reducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_risk" title="Flood risk">flood risks</a>, preventing drought effects, and maintaining a balanced ecosystem.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-2"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>

<p>Czech conservation authorities praised the beavers for their unexpected yet effective environmental work. Bohumil Fi≈°er, head of the Brdy Protected Landscape Area, stated that the beavers "built the dams without any project documentation and for free", and achieved the desired ecological outcomes "practically overnight".<sup id="cite_ref-:1_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-:1-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:3_6-2"><a href="#cite_note-:3-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> The estimated cost savings for the Czech government amounted to 30 million <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_koruna" title="Czech koruna">Czech koruna</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">US$</a>1.2 million), as the project was completed without human labor or funding.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>Zoologists and environmentalists emphasized the broader significance of the event, reinforcing the role of beavers as "ecosystem engineers".<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> This case contributed to growing discussions in Europe about the benefits of beaver <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewilding" title="Rewilding">rewilding</a> programs, particularly in regions where their activity supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_management" title="Flood management">flood management</a>, water conservation, and habitat restoration.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-3"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>The Brdy beaver colony is part of a larger resurgence of Eurasian beaver populations in the Czech Republic, with estimates indicating around 15,000 individuals across the country.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_7-1"><a href="#cite_note-:2-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> While beavers can sometimes create conflicts by felling trees or flooding agricultural lands, officials noted that the Brdy site is located far from farmland, making long-term coexistence with the beavers feasible.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> Authorities anticipate no significant conflicts with the beaver colony for at least the next decade.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>
