<p><em><span>“</span>Well, Congressman, I view our responsibility as not just building services that people like to use, but making sure that those services are also good for people and good for society overall.” — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/11/transcript-of-zuckerbergs-appearance-before-house-committee/">Mark Zuckerberg, 2018</a></em></p>
<p>In the previous two posts in this series, I did a <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-i-the-setup">long but briskly paced early history</a> of Meta and the internet in Myanmar—and the hateful and dehumanizing speech that came with it—and then looked at what an outside-the-company view could reveal about <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-ii-the-crisis">Meta’s role in the genocide of the Rohingya</a> in 2016 and 2017.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll look at what two whistleblowers and a crucial newspaper investigation reveal about what was happening <em>inside</em> Meta at the time. Specifically, the disclosed information:</p>
<ul>
<li>gives us a quantitative view of Meta’s content moderation performance—which, in turn, highlights a deceptive <span>PR</span> move routine Meta uses when questioned about moderation;</li>
<li>clarifies what Meta knew about the effects of its algorithmic recommendations systems; and</li>
<li>reveals a parasitic takeover of the Facebook platform by covert influence campaigns around the world—including in Myanmar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we get into that, a brief personal note. There are few ways to be in the world that I enjoy less than<span></span> <span>“</span>breathless conspiratorial.” That rhetorical mode muddies the water when people most need clarity and generates an emotional charge that works against effective decision-making. I really don’t like it. So it’s been unnerving to synthesize a lot of mostly public information and come up with results that wouldn’t look completely out of place in one of those overwrought threads.</p>
<p>I don’t know what to <em>do</em> with that except to be forthright but not dramatic, and to treat my readers’ endocrine systems with respect by avoiding needless flourishes. But the story is just rough and many people in it do bad things. (You can read my <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-meta">meta-post about terminology and sourcing</a> if you want to see me agonize over the minutiae.)</p>
<p><strong>Content warnings for the post:</strong> The whole series is about genocide and hate speech. There are no graphic descriptions or images, and this post includes no slurs or specific examples of hateful and inciting messages, but still. (And there’s a fairly unpleasant photograph of a spider at about the 40% mark.)</p>
<h2 id="the-disclosures">The disclosures</h2>
<p>When Frances Haugen, a former product manager on Meta’s Civic Integrity team, disclosed a ton of internal Meta docs to the SEC—and several media outlets—in 2021, I didn’t really pay attention. I was pandemic-tired and I didn’t think there’d be much in there that I didn’t know. I was wrong!</p>
<p>Frances Haugen’s disclosures are of generational importance, especially if you’re willing to dig down past the US-centric headlines. Haugen has stated that she came forward because of things outside the <span>US—</span><a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1505967624412356612.html">Myanmar</a> and its horrific echo years later in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/25/business/frances-haugen-facebook.html">Ethiopia</a>, specifically, and the likelihood that it would all just keep happening. So it makes sense that the docs she disclosed would be highly relevant, which they are.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://facebookpapers.com/sec-documents/">eight disclosures</a> in the bundle of information Haugen delivered via lawyers to the <span>SEC</span>, and each is about one specific way Meta<span></span> <span>“</span>misled investors and the public.” Each disclosure takes the form of a letter (which probably has a special legal name I don’t know) and a huge stack of primary documents. The majority of those documents—internal posts, memos, emails, comments—haven’t yet been made public, but the letters themselves include excerpts, and <a href="https://facebookpapers.wpengine.com/">subsequent media coverage</a> and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/facebook-papers-how-to-read-1848702919">straightforward doc dumps</a> have revealed a little bit more. When I cite the disclosures, I’ll point to the place where you can read the longest chunk of primary text—often that’s just the little excerpts in the letters, but sometimes we have a whole—albeit redacted—document to look at.</p>

<p>Before continuing, I think it’s only fair to note that the disclosures we see in public are necessarily those that run counter to Meta’s public statements, because otherwise there would be no need to disclose them. And because we’re only getting excerpts, there’s obviously a ton of context missing—including, presumably, dissenting internal views. I’m not interested in making a handwavey case based on one or two people inside a company making wild statements. So I’m only emphasizing points that are supported in multiple, specific excerpts.</p>
<p>Let’s start with content moderation and what the disclosures have to say about it.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-dangerous-stuff-gets-taken-down">How much dangerous stuff gets taken down?</h2>
<p>We don’t know how much<span></span> <span>“</span>objectionable content” is actually on Facebook—or on Instagram, or Twitter, or any other big platform. The companies running those platforms don’t know the exact numbers either, but what they do have are reasonably accurate <em>estimates</em>. We know they have estimates because sampling and human-powered data classification is how you train the <span>AI</span> classifiers required to do content-based moderation—removing posts and comments—at mass scale. And that process necessarily lets you estimate from your samples roughly how much of a given kind of problem you’re seeing. (This is pretty common knowledge, but it’s also confirmed in an internal doc I quote below.)</p>
<p>The platforms aren’t sharing those estimates with us because no one’s forcing them to. And probably also because, based on what we’ve seen from the disclosures, the numbers are <em>quite bad</em>. So I want to look at how bad they are, or recently were, on Facebook. Alongside that, I want to point out the most common way Meta distracts reporters and governing bodies from its terrible stats, because I think it’s a very useful thing to be able to spot.</p>
<p>One of Frances Haugen’s <span>SEC</span> disclosure letters is about Meta’s failures to moderate hate speech. It’s helpfully titled,<span></span> <span>“</span><a href="https://facebookpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Hate-speech_Redacted.pdf">Facebook misled investors and the public about<span></span> <span>‘</span>transparency’ reports boasting proactive removal of over 90% of identified hate speech when internal records show that<span></span> <span>‘</span>as little as 3-5% of hate’ speech is actually removed</a>.”<a href="#footnote-1UCM" id="ref-1UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Here’s the excerpt from the internal Meta document from which that<span></span> <span>“</span>3–5%” figure is drawn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…we’re deleting less than 5% of all of the hate speech posted to Facebook. This is actually an optimistic estimate—previous (and more rigorous) iterations of this estimation exercise have put it closer to 3%, and on V&amp;I [violence and incitement] we’re deleting somewhere around 0.6%…we miss 95% of violating hate speech.<a href="#footnote-2UCM" id="ref-2UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s another quote from different memo excerpted in the same disclosure letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]e do not … have a model that captures even a majority of integrity harms, particularly in sensitive areas … We only take action against approximately 2% of the hate speech on the platform. Recent estimates suggest that unless there is a major change in strategy, it will be very difficult to improve this beyond 10-20% in the short-medium term.<a href="#footnote-3UCM" id="ref-3UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another estimate from a third internal document:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We seem to be having a small impact in many language-country pairs on Hate Speech and Borderline Hate, probably ~3% … We are likely having little (if any) impact on violence.<a href="#footnote-4UCM" id="ref-4UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s a fourth one, specific to a study about Facebook in Afghanistan, which I include to help contextualize the global numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While Hate Speech is consistently ranked as one of the top abuse categories in the Afghanistan market, the action rate for Hate Speech is worryingly low at 0.23 per cent.<a href="#footnote-5UCM" id="ref-5UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think these figures need a ton of commentary, honestly. I would agree that removing less than a quarter of a percent of hate speech is indeed<span></span> <span>“</span>worryingly low,” as is removing 0.6% of violence and incitement messages. I think removing even 5% of hate speech—the highest number cited in the disclosures—is objectively terrible performance, and I think most people outside of the tech industry would agree with that. Which is presumably why Meta has put a <em>ton</em> of work into muddying the waters around content moderation.</p>
<p>So back to that <span>SEC</span> letter with the long name. It points something out, which is that Meta has long claimed that Facebook<span></span> <span>“</span>proactively” detects between <strong>95%</strong> (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/19/936706748/facebook-says-its-doing-a-better-job-of-catching-hate-speech-before-users-see-it">in 2020, globally</a>) and <strong>98%</strong> (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-socialmedia-insight-idAFKBN2HM3BU">in Myanmar, in 2021</a>) of all the posts it removes because they’re hate speech—before users even see them.</p>
<p>At a glance, this looks good. Ninety-five percent is a lot! But since we know from the disclosed material that based on internal estimates the takedown rates for hate speech are at or below 5%, what’s going on here?</p>
<p>Here’s what Meta is actually saying: Sure, they might identify and remove only a tiny fraction of dangerous and hateful speech on Facebook, but <em>of that tiny fraction</em>, their <span>AI</span> classifiers catch about 95–98% before users report it. That’s literally the whole game, here.</p>
<p>So…the most generous number from the disclosed memos has Meta removing <strong>5% of hate speech on Facebook</strong>. That would mean that for every <strong>2,000</strong> hateful posts or comments, Meta removes about <strong>100–95</strong> automatically and <strong>5</strong> via user reports. In this example, 1,900 of the original 2,000 messages remain up and circulating. So based on the generous 5% removal rate, their <span>AI</span> systems nailed…4.75% of hate speech. That’s the level of performance they’re bragging about.</p>
<p>You don’t need to take my word for any of this—<cite>Wired</cite> <a href="https://erinkissane.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-deceptive-math-when-it-comes-to-hate-speech/%E2%80%9D">ran a critique</a> breaking it down in 2021 and Ranking Digital Rights has <a href="https://erinkissane.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://rankingdigitalrights.org/2021/10/14/cross-checking-facebook-frances-haugen/%E2%80%9D">a strongly worded post</a> about what Meta claims in public vs.&nbsp;what the leaked documents reveal to be true, including this content moderation math runaround.</p>
<p>Meta does this particular routine <em>all the time</em>.</p>
<h2 id="the-shell-game">The shell game</h2>
<p>Here’s Mark Zuckerberg on April 10th, 2018, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/10/transcript-of-mark-zuckerbergs-senate-hearing/">answering a question in front of the Senate’s Commerce and Judiciary committees</a>. He says that hate speech is really hard to find automatically and then pivots to something that he says is a real success, which is<span></span> <span>“</span>terrorist propaganda,” which he simplifies immediately to<span></span> <span>“</span><span>ISIS</span> and Al Qaida content.” But that stuff? No problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contrast [hate speech], for example, with an area like finding terrorist propaganda, which we’ve actually been very successful at deploying A.I. tools on already. Today, as we sit here, 99 percent of the <span>ISIS</span> and Al Qaida content that we take down on Facebook, our A.I. systems flag before any human sees it. So that’s a success in terms of rolling out A.I. tools that can proactively police and enforce safety across the community.<a href="#footnote-6UCM" id="ref-6UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that’s 99% of…the unknown percentage of this kind of content that’s actually removed.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg actually <em>tries</em> to do the same thing the next day, April 11th, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/11/transcript-of-zuckerbergs-appearance-before-house-committee/">before the House Energy and Commerce Committee</a>, but he whiffs the maneuver:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…we’re getting good in certain areas. One of the areas that I mentioned earlier was terrorist content, for example, where we now have A.I. systems that can identify and—and take down 99 percent of the al-Qaeda and ISIS-related content in our system before someone—a human even flags it to us. I think we need to do more of that.<a href="#footnote-7UCM" id="ref-7UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The version Zuckerberg says right there, on April 11th, is what I’m pretty sure most people think Meta means when they go into this stuff—but as stated, it’s a lie.</p>
<p>No one in those hearings presses Zuckerberg on those numbers—and when Meta repeats the move in 2020, plenty of reporters fall into the trap and make untrue claims favorable to Meta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…between its <span>AI</span> systems and its human content moderators, Facebook says it’s detecting and removing 95% of hate content before anyone sees it. —<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90577901/facebook-says-its-deleting-95-of-hate-speech-before-anyone-sees-it">Fast Company</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>About 95 percent of hate speech on Facebook gets caught by algorithms before anyone can report it… —<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/11/facebook-touts-enforcement-amid-investigations-moderator-complaints/">Ars Technica</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook said it took action on 22.1 million pieces of hate speech content to its platform globally last quarter and about 6.5 million pieces of hate speech content on Instagram. On both platforms, it says about 95% of that hate speech was proactively identified and stopped by artificial intelligence. —<a href="https://www.axios.com/2020/11/19/facebook-instagram-hate-speech-metric">Axios</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The company said it now finds and eliminates about 95% of the hate speech violations using automated software systems before a user ever reports them… —<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-11/facebook-pulls-22-5-million-hate-speech-posts-in-second-quarter?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is all not just wrong but <em>wildly wrong</em> if you have the internal numbers in front of you.</p>
<p>I’m hitting this point so hard not because I want to point out ~corporate hypocrisy~ or whatever, but because this deceptive runaround is consequential for two reasons: The first is that it provides instructive context about how to interpret Meta’s public statements. The second is that it actually says extremely dire things about Meta’s only hope for content-based moderation at scale, which is their AI-based classifiers.</p>
<p>Here’s Zuckerberg saying as much to a congressional committee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…one thing that I think is important to understand overall is just the sheer volume of content on Facebook makes it so that we can’t—no amount of people that we can hire will be enough to review all of the content.…&nbsp;We need to rely on and build sophisticated A.I. tools that can help us flag certain content.<a href="#footnote-8UCM" id="ref-8UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement is kinda disingenuous in a couple of ways, but the central point is true: the scale of these platforms makes human review incredibly difficult. And Meta’s reasonable-sounding explanation is that this means they have to focus on <span>AI</span>. But by their own internal estimates, Meta’s <span>AI</span> classifiers are only identifying something in the range of 4.75% of hate speech on Facebook, and often considerably less. That seems like a dire stat for the thing you’re putting forward to Congress as your best hope!</p>
<p>The same disclosed internal memo that told us Meta was deleting between 3% and 5% of hate speech had this to say about the potential of <span>AI</span> classifiers to handle mass-scale content removals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[O]ur current approach of grabbing a hundred thousand pieces of content, paying people to label them as Hate or Not Hate, training a classifier, and using it to automatically delete content at 95% precision is just never going to make much of a dent.<a href="#footnote-9UCM" id="ref-9UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting content moderation to work for even extreme and widely reviled categories of speech is obviously genuinely difficult, so I want to be extra clear about a foundational piece of my argument.</p>
<h2 id="responsibility-for-the-machine">Responsibility for the machine</h2>
<p>I think that if you make a machine and hand it out for free to everyone in the world, you’re at least partially responsible for the harm that the machine does.</p>

<p>Also, even if you say,<span></span> <span>“</span>but it’s very difficult to make the machine safer!” I don’t think that reduces your responsibility so much as it makes you look shortsighted and bad at machines.</p>
<p>Beyond the bare fact of difficulty, though, I think the more <em>what harm the machine does</em> deviates from <em>what people might expect a machine that looks like this to do</em>, the more responsibility you bear: If you offer everyone in the world a grenade, I think that’s bad, but also it won’t be surprising when people who take the grenade get hurt or hurt someone else. But when you offer everyone a cute little robot assistant that turns out to be easily repurposed as a rocket launcher, I think that falls into another category.</p>
<p>Especially if you see that people are using your cute little robot assistant to murder thousands of people and elect not to disarm it because that would make it a little less cute.</p>
<p>This brings us to the algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="core-product-mechanics"><span>“</span>Core product mechanics”</h2>
<p><img src="https://erinkissane.com/_files/chalkboard.png" alt="Screencap of an internal Meta document titled Facebook and responsibility, with a header image of the Bart Simson writing on the chalkboard meme in which the writing on the board reads, Facebook is responsible for ranking and recommendations!"></p><p>
<i>From a screencapped version of<span></span> <span>“</span>Facebook and responsibility,” one of the disclosed internal documents.</i>
</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-ii-the-crisis">second post in this series</a>, I quoted people in Myanmar who were trying to cope with an overwhelming flood of hateful and violence-inciting messages. It felt obvious on the ground that the worst, most dangerous posts were getting the most juice.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Haugen disclosures, we can confirm that this was also understood inside Meta.</p>

<p>In 2019, a Meta employee wrote a memo called<span></span> <span>“</span>What is Collateral damage.” It included these statements (my emphasis):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“</span>We have evidence from a variety of sources that hate speech, divisive political speech, and misinformation on Facebook and the family of apps are affecting societies around the world. We also have compelling evidence that <em>our core product mechanics, such as virality, recommendations, and optimizing for engagement, are a significant part of why these types of speech flourish</em> on the platform.</p>
<p>If integrity takes a hands-off stance for these problems, whether for technical (precision) or philosophical reasons, then the net result is that Facebook, taken as a whole, will be actively (if not necessarily consciously) promoting these types of activities. <em>The mechanics of our platform are not neutral.</em> <a href="#footnote-10UCM" id="ref-10UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you work in tech or if you’ve been following mainstream press accounts about Meta over the years, you presumably already know this, but I think it’s useful to establish this piece of the internal conversation.</p>
<p>Here’s a long breakdown from 2020 about the specific parts of the platform that actively put<span></span> <span>“</span>unconnected content”—messages that aren’t from friends or Groups people subscribe to—in front of Facebook users. It comes from an internal post called<span></span> <span>“</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21594152-tier2_rank_other_0320">Facebook and responsibility</a><span></span><span>”</span> (my emphasis):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook is most active in delivering content to users on recommendation surfaces like<span></span> <span>“</span>Pages you may like,”<span></span> <span>“</span>Groups you should join,” and suggested videos on Watch. <strong>These are surfaces where Facebook delivers unconnected content. Users don’t opt-in to these experiences by following other users or Pages. Instead, Facebook is actively presenting these experiences…</strong></p>
<p>News Feed ranking is another way Facebook becomes actively involved in these harmful experiences. Of course users also play an active role in determining the content they are connected to through feed, by choosing who to friend and follow. Still, when and whether a user sees a piece of content is also partly determined by the ranking scores our algorithms assign, which are ultimately under our control. This means, according to ethicists, Facebook is always at least partially responsible for any harmful experiences on News Feed.</p>
<p>This doesn’t owe to any flaw with our News Feed ranking system, it’s just inherent to the process of ranking. To rank items in Feed, we assign scores to all the content available to a user and then present the highest-scoring content first. Most feed ranking scores are determined by relevance models. If the content is determined to be an integrity harm, the score is also determined by some additional ranking machinery to demote it lower than it would have appeared given its score. Crucially, all of these algorithms produce a single score; a score Facebook assigns. Thus, there is no such thing as inaction on Feed. We can only choose to take different kinds of actions.<a href="#footnote-11UCM" id="ref-11UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next few quotes will apply directly to <span>US</span> concerns, but they’re clearly broadly applicable to the 90% of Facebook users who are outside the <span>US</span> and Canada, and whose disinfo concerns receive vastly fewer resources.</p>
<p>This one is from an internal Meta doc from November 5, 2020:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not only do we not do something about combustible election misinformation in comments, we amplify them and give them broader distribution.<a href="#footnote-12UCM" id="ref-12UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Meta staff tried to take the measure of their own recommendation systems’ behavior, they found that the systems led a fresh, newly made account into disinfo-infested waters very quickly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a small number of high quality/verified conservative interest follows…&nbsp;within just one day Page recommendations had already devolved towards polarizing content.</p>
<p>Although the account set out to follow conservative political news and humor content generally, and began by following verified/high quality conservative pages, Page recommendations began to include conspiracy recommendations after only 2 days (it took &lt;1 week to get a QAnon recommendation!)</p>
<p>Group recommendations were slightly slower to follow suit - it took 1 week for in-feed <span>GYSJ</span> recommendations to become fully political/right-leaning, and just over 1 week to begin receiving conspiracy recommendations.<a href="#footnote-13UCM" id="ref-13UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same document reveals that several of the Pages and Groups Facebook’s systems recommend to its test user show multiple signs of association with<span></span> <span>“</span>coordinated inauthentic behavior,” aka foreign and domestic covert influence campaigns, which we’ll get to very soon.</p>
<p>Before that, I want to offer just one example of algorithmic malpractice from Myanmar.</p>
<h2 id="flower-speech">Flower speech</h2>
<p><img src="https://erinkissane.com/_files/panzagar.jpg" alt="Panzagar campaign illustration depicting a Burmese girl with thanaka on her cheek and illustrated flowers coming from her mouth, flowing toward speech bubbles labeled with the names of Burmese towns and cities."></p>
<p>Back in 2014, Burmese organizations including <span>MIDO</span> and Yangon-based tech accelerator Phandeeyar collaborated on a carefully calibrated <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/in-person/hate-speech-pours-poison-heart.html">counter-speech project called Panzagar (<em>flower speech</em>)</a>. The campaign—which was designed to be delivered in person, in printed materials, and online—encouraged ordinary Burmese citizens to push back on hate speech in Myanmar.</p>
<p>Later that year, Meta, which had just been implicated in the deadly communal violence in Mandalay, joined with the Burmese orgs to turn their imagery into digital Facebook stickers that users could apply to posts calling for things like the annihilation of the Rohingya people. The stickers depict cute cartoon characters, several of which offer admonishments like,<span></span> <span>“</span>Don’t be the source of a fire,”<span></span> <span>“</span>Think before you share,”<span></span> <span>“</span>Don’t you be spawning hate,” and<span></span> <span>“</span>Let it go buddy!”</p>
<p>The campaign was widely and approvingly covered by <a href="https://beautifultrouble.org/toolbox/tool/flower-speech-campaign/">western organizations</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/using-flower-speech-and-new-facebook-tools-myanmar-fights-online-hate-speech/2014/12/24/3bff458c-8ba9-11e4-ace9-47de1af4c3eb_story.html">media outlets</a>, and Meta got a lot of praise for its involvement.</p>
<p>But according to members of the Burmese civil society coalition behind the campaign, it turned out that the Panzagar Facebook stickers—which were explicitly designed as counterspeech—“carried significant weight in their distribution algorithm,” so <em>anyone who used them to counter hateful and violent messages inadvertently helped those messages gain wider distribution</em>.<a href="#footnote-14UCM" id="ref-14UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>I mention the Panzagar incident not only because it’s such a head-smacking example of Meta favoring cosmetic, PR-friendly tweaks over meaningful redress, or because it reveals plain incompetence in the face of already-serious violence, but also because it gets to what I see as a genuinely foundational problem with Meta in Myanmar.</p>
<p>Even when the company was finally (repeatedly) forced to take notice of the dangers it was contributing to, actions that could actually have made a difference—like rolling out new programs only after local consultation and adaptation, scaling up culturally and linguistically competent human moderation teams in tandem with increasing uptake, and above all, <em>altering the design of the product</em> to stop amplifying the most charged messages—remained not just undone, but <em>unthinkable</em> because they were outside the company’s understanding of what the product’s design should take into consideration.</p>
<p>This refusal to connect core project design with accelerating global safety problems means that attempts at prevention and repair are relegated to window-dressing—or which are actually counterproductive, as in the case of the Panzagar stickers, which absorbed the energy and efforts of local Burmese civil society groups and turned them into something that made the situation <em>worse</em>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/interview/alex-stamos/">2018 interview with Frontline about problems with Facebook</a>, Meta’s former Chief Security Officer, Alex Stamos, returns again and again to the idea that security work properly happens at the product design level. Toward the end of the interview, he gets very clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stamos: I think there was a structural problem here in that the people who were dealing with the downsides were all working together over kind of in the corner, right, so you had the safety and security teams, tight-knit teams that deal with all the bad outcomes, and we didn’t really have a relationship with the people who are actually designing the product.</p>
<p>Interviewer: You did not have a relationship?</p>
<p>Stamos: Not like we should have, right? It became clear—one of the things that became very clear after the election was that the problems that we knew about and were dealing with before were not making it back into how these products are designed and implemented.<a href="#footnote-15UCM" id="ref-15UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meta’s content moderation was a disaster in Myanmar—and around the world—not only because it was treated and staffed like an afterthought, but because it was <em>competing against Facebook’s core machinery</em>.</p>
<p>And just as the house always wins, the core machinery of a mass-scale product built to boost engagement always defeats retroactive and peripheral attempts at cleanup.</p>
<p>This is especially true once organized commercial and nation-state actors figured out how to take over that machinery with large-scale fake Page networks boosted by fake engagement, which brings us to a less-discussed revelation: By the mid-2010s, Facebook had effectively become the equivalent of botnet in the hands of any group, governmental or commercial, who could summon the will and resources to exploit it.</p>
<p>A lot of people did, including, predictably, some of the worst people in the world.</p>

<p>In 2018, the <em>New York Times</em> published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html?unlocked_article_code=KARVJapYvl1Y6L1cieWmNoOFxPgEAC2ZMHtfiZ7BsjuB4MSBfeTmmw8qAgf_LqJHnCEapaMqECHmO3q7kvvtYwii2910C_u_Kg-_EbNKEiyYglifgsfqSOQjuBB7jIpIGMYoG6yhsVeZ870Qc4PGIb0GNsypqYsMOY73_yzGrn79cFHQfEzvYPBJATppRHCHK-qy3gOmuLY0Tw_NmiDBDrF9veQ5xyjMCtfYXjNOJ1IbzxXuzCFUPMwscGe1WwM8-g_f-Byy-zbYVnSYx_wTJYPcCcrp7KppFt6NpxbBbVHLO0e-2gd2LKxotalTNVYGXiHq2mJYNaVhoDJaixTf6GADI3oUnA&amp;smid=url-share">a front-page account</a> of what really happened on Facebook in Myanmar, which is that beginning around 2013, Myanmar’s military, the Tatmadaw, set up a dedicated, ultra-secret anti-Rohingya hatefarm spread across military bases in which up to 700 staffers worked in shifts <strong>to manufacture the appearance of overwhelming support for the genocide the same military then carried out</strong>.<a href="#footnote-16UCM" id="ref-16UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>When the <em><span>NYT</span></em> did their investigation in 2018, all those fake Pages were still up.</p>
<p>Here’s how it worked: First, the military set up a sprawling network of fake accounts and Pages on Facebook. The fake accounts and Pages focused on innocuous subjects like beauty, entertainment, and humor. These Pages were called things like,<span></span> <span>“</span>Beauty and Classic,”<span></span> <span>“</span>Down for Anything,”<span></span> <span>“</span>You Female Teachers,”<span></span> <span>“</span>We Love Myanmar,” and<span></span> <span>“</span>Let’s Laugh Casually.” Then military staffers, some trained by Russian propaganda specialists, spent years tending the Pages and gradually building up followers.<a href="#footnote-17UCM" id="ref-17UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Then, using this array of long-nurtured fake Pages—and Groups, and accounts—the Tatmadaw’s propagandists used everything they’d learned about Facebook’s algorithms to post and boost viral messages that cast Rohingya people as part of a global Islamic threat, and as the perpetrators of a never-ending stream of atrocities. The <em>Times</em> reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Troll accounts run by the military helped spread the content, shout down critics and fuel arguments between commenters to rile people up. Often, they posted sham photos of corpses that they said were evidence of Rohingya-perpetrated massacres…<a href="#footnote-18UCM" id="ref-18UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That the Tatmadaw was capable of such a sophisticated operation shouldn’t have come as a surprise. Longtime Myanmar digital rights and technology researcher Victoire Rio notes that the Tatmadaw had been openly sending its officers to study in Russia since 2001, was<span></span> <span>“</span>among the first adopters of the Facebook platform in Myanmar” and launched<span></span> <span>“</span>a dedicated curriculum as part of its Defense Service Academy Information Warfare training.”<a href="#footnote-19UCM" id="ref-19UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="what-these-messages-did">What these messages did</h2>
<p>I don’t have the access required to sort out which specific messages originated from extremist religious networks vs.&nbsp;which were produced by military operations, but I’ve seen a lot of the posts and comments central to these overlapping campaigns in the <span>UN</span> documents and human rights reports.</p>
<p>They do some very specific things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>They dehumanize the Rohingya:</strong> The Facebook messages speak of the Rohingya as invasive species that outbreed Buddhists and Myanmar’s <em>real</em> ethnic groups. There are a lot of bestiality images.</li>
<li><strong>They present the Rohingya as inhumane, as sexual predators, and as an immediate threat:</strong> There are a lot of graphic photos of mangled bodies from around the world, most of them presented as Buddhist victims of Muslim killers—usually Rohingya. There are a lot of posts about Rohingya men raping, forcibly marrying, beating, and murdering Buddhist women. One post that got passed around a lot includes a graphic photo of a woman tortured and murdered by a Mexican cartel, presented as a Buddhist woman in Myanmar murdered by the Rohingya.</li>
<li><strong>They connect the Rohingya to the<span></span> <span>“</span>global Islamic threat”:</strong> There’s a lot of equating Rohingya people with <span>ISIS</span> terrorists and assigning them group responsibility for real attacks and atrocities by distant Islamic terror organizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, all of these moves flow into demands for violence. The messages call incessantly and graphically for mass killings, beatings, and forced deportations. They call not for punishment, but annihilation.</p>
<p>This is, literally, textbook preparation for genocide, and I want to take a moment to look at how it works.</p>
<p>Helen Fein is the author of several definitive books on genocide, a co-founder and first president of the International Association of Genocide Scholars, and the founder of the Institute for the Study of Genocide. I think her description of the ways genocidaires legitimize their attacks holds up extremely well despite having been published 30 years ago. Here, she classifies a specific kind of rhetoric as one of the defining characteristics of genocide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Is there evidence of an ideology, myth, or an articulated social goal which enjoins or justifies the destruction of the victim? Besides the above, observe religious traditions of contempt and collective defamation, stereotypes, and derogatory metaphor indicating the victim is inferior, subhuman (animals, insects, germs, viruses) or superhuman (Satanic, omnipotent), or other signs that the victims were pre-defined as alien, outside the universe of obligation of the perpetrator, subhuman or dehumanized, or the enemy—i.e., the victim needs to be eliminated in order that we may live (Them or Us).<a href="#footnote-20UCM" id="ref-20UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s also necessary for genocidaires to make claims—often supported by manufactured evidence—that the targeted group itself is the true danger, often by projecting genocidal intent onto the group that will be attacked.</p>
<p>Adam Jones, the guy who wrote a <a href="https://erinkissane.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.routledge.com/Genocide-A-Comprehensive-Introduction/Jones/p/book/9781138823846%E2%80%9D">widely used textbook on genocide</a>, puts it this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
One justifies genocidal designs by imputing such designs to perceived opponents. The Tutsis/ Croatians/Jews/Bolsheviks must be killed because they harbor intentions to kill us, and will do so if they are not stopped/prevented/annihilated. Before they are killed, they are brutalized, debased, and dehumanized—turning them into something approaching<span></span> <span>“</span>subhumans” or<span></span> <span>“</span>animals” and, by a circular logic, justifying their extermination.<a href="#footnote-21UCM" id="ref-21UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So before their annihilation, the target group is presented as outcast, subhuman, vermin, but also themselves genocidal—a mortal threat. And afterward, the extraordinary cruelties characteristic of genocide reassure those committing the atrocities that their victims aren’t actually people.</p>
<p>The Tatmadaw committed atrocities in Myanmar. I touched on them in <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-ii-the-crisis">Part <span>II</span></a> and I’m not going to detail them here. But the figuratively dehumanizing rhetoric I described in parts one and two can’t be separated from the literally dehumanizing things the Tatmadaw did to the humans they maimed and traumatized and killed. Especially now that it’s clear that the military was behind much of the rhetoric as well as the violent actions that rhetoric worked to justify.</p>
<p>In some cases, even the methods match up: The military’s campaign of intense and systematic sexual violence toward and mutilation of women and girls, combined with the concurrent mass murder of children and babies, feels inextricably connected to the rhetoric that cast the Rohingya as both a sexual and reproductive threat who endanger the safety of Buddhist women and outbreed the ethnicities that <em>belong</em> in Myanmar.</p>
<p>Genocidal communications are an inextricable part of a system that turns<span></span> <span>“</span>ethnic tensions” into mass death. When we see that the Tatmadaw was literally the operator of covert hate and dehumanization propaganda networks on Facebook, I think the most rational way to understand those networks is as <em>an integral part</em> of the genocidal campaign.</p>
<hr>
<p>After the <em>New York Times</em> article went live, Meta did two big takedowns. Nearly four million people were following the fake Pages identified by either the <em><span>NYT</span></em> or by Meta in follow-up investigations. (Meta had previously removed the Tatmadaw’s own official Pages and accounts and 46<span></span> <span>“</span>news and opinion” Pages that turned out to be covertly operated by the military—those Pages were followed by nearly 12 million people.)</p>
<p>So given these revelations and disclosures, here’s my question: Does the deliberate, adversarial use of Facebook by Myanmar’s military as a platform for disinformation and propaganda take any of the heat off of Meta? After all, a sovereign country’s military is a significant adversary.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing—Alex Stamos, Facebook’s Chief Security Officer, had been trying <em>since 2016</em> to get Meta’s management and executives to acknowledge and meaningfully address the fact that Facebook was being used as host for both commercial and state-sponsored covert influence ops around the world. Including in the only place where it was likely to get the company into <em>really</em> hot water: the United States.</p>
<h2 id="oh-fuck"><span>“</span>Oh fuck”</h2>
<p>On December 16, 2016, Facebook’s newish Chief Security Officer, Alex Stamos—who now runs Stanford’s Internet Observatory—rang Meta’s biggest alarm bells by calling an emergency meeting with Mark Zuckerberg and other top-level Meta executives.</p>
<p>In that meeting, documented in Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang’s book, <em>The Ugly Truth</em>, Stamos handed out a summary outlining the Russian capabilities. It read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We assess with moderate to high conﬁdence that Russian state-sponsored actors are using Facebook in an attempt to inﬂuence the broader political discourse via the deliberate spread of questionable news articles, the spread of information from data breaches intended to discredit, and actively engaging with journalists to spread said stolen information.<a href="#footnote-22UCM" id="ref-22UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>“</span>Oh fuck, how did we miss this?” Zuckerberg responded.</p>

<p>Stamos’ team had also uncovered<span></span> <span>“</span>a huge network of false news sites on Facebook” posting and cross-promoting sensationalist bullshit, much of it political disinformation, along with examples of governmental propaganda operations from Indonesia, Turkey, and other nation-state actors. And the team had recommendations on what to do about it.</p>
<p>Frenkel and Kang paraphrase Stamos’ message to Zuckerberg (my emphasis):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook needed to go on the oﬀensive. It should no longer merely monitor and analyze cyber operations; the company had to gear up for battle. But to do so required <strong>a radical change in culture and structure</strong>. Russia’s incursions were missed because departments across Facebook hadn’t communicated and because no one had taken the time to think like Vladimir Putin.<a href="#footnote-23UCM" id="ref-23UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those changes in culture and structure didn’t happen. Stamos began to realize that to Meta’s executives, his work uncovering the foreign influence networks, and his choice to bring them to the executives’ attention, were both unwelcome and deeply inconvenient.</p>
<p>All through the spring and summer of 2017, instead of retooling to fight the massive international <em>category</em> of abuse Stamos and his colleagues had uncovered, Facebook played hot potato with the information about the ops Russia had already run.</p>
<p>On September 21, 2017, while the Tatmadaw’s genocidal<span></span> <span>“</span>clearance operations” were approaching their completion, Mark Zuckerberg finally spoke publicly about the Russian influence campaign for the first time.<a href="#footnote-24UCM" id="ref-24UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In the intervening months, the massive covert influence networks operating in Myanmar ground along, unnoticed.</p>
<p>Thanks to Sophie Zhang, a data scientist who spent two years at Facebook fighting to get networks like the Tatmadaw’s removed, we know quite a lot about why.</p>
<h2 id="what-sophie-zhang-found">What Sophie Zhang found</h2>
<p>In 2018, Facebook hired a data scientist named Sophie Zhang and assigned her to a new team working on fake engagement—and specifically on<span></span> <span>“</span>scripted inauthentic activity,” or bot-driven fake likes and shares.</p>
<p>Within her first year on the team, Zhang began finding examples of bot-driven engagement being used for political messages in both Brazil and India ahead of their national elections. Then she found something that concerned her a lot more. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/29/1030260/facebook-whistleblower-sophie-zhang-global-political-manipulation/">Karen Hao of the <span>MIT</span> Technology Review writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The administrator for the Facebook page of the Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hernández, had created hundreds of pages with fake names and profile pictures to look just like users—and was using them to flood the president’s posts with likes, comments, and shares. (Facebook bars users from making multiple profiles but doesn’t apply the same restriction to pages, which are usually meant for businesses and public figures.)</p>
<p>The activity didn’t count as scripted, but the effect was the same. Not only could it mislead the casual observer into believing Hernández was more well-liked and popular than he was, but it was also boosting his posts higher up in people’s newsfeeds. For a politician whose 2017 reelection victory was widely believed to be fraudulent, the brazenness—and implications—were alarming.<a href="#footnote-25UCM" id="ref-25UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Zhang brought her discovery back to the teams working on Pages Integrity and News Feed Integrity, both refused to act, either to stop fake Pages from being created, or to keep the fake engagement signals the fake Pages generate from making posts go viral.</p>
<p>But Zhang kept at it, and after a year, Meta finally removed the Honduran network. The very next day, Zhang reported a network of fake Pages in Albania. <em>The Guardian</em><span></span><span>’</span>s Julia Carrie Wong <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/12/facebook-fake-engagement-whistleblower-sophie-zhang">explains what came next</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In August, she discovered and filed escalations for suspicious networks in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, Mexico, Argentina and Italy. Throughout the autumn and winter she added networks in the Philippines, Afghanistan, South Korea, Bolivia, Ecuador, Iraq, Tunisia, Turkey, Taiwan, Paraguay, El Salvador, India, the Dominican Republic, Indonesia, Ukraine, Poland and Mongolia.<a href="#footnote-26UCM" id="ref-26UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Zhang, Meta eventually established a policy against<span></span> <span>“</span>inauthentic behavior,” but didn’t enforce it, and rejected Zhang’s proposal to punish repeat fake-Page creators by banning their personal accounts because of policy staff’s<span></span> <span>“</span>discomfort with taking action against people connected to high-profile accounts.”<a href="#footnote-27UCM" id="ref-27UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Zhang discovered that even when she took initiative to track down covert influence campaigns, the teams who <em>could</em> take action to remove them didn’t—not without persistent<span></span> <span>“</span>lobbying.” So Zhang tried harder. Here’s Karen Hao again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She was called upon repeatedly to help handle emergencies and praised for her work, which she was told was valued and important.</p>
<p>But despite her repeated attempts to push for more resources, leadership cited different priorities. They also dismissed Zhang’s suggestions for a more sustainable solution, such as suspending or otherwise penalizing politicians who were repeat offenders. It left her to face a never-ending firehose: The manipulation networks she took down quickly came back, often only hours or days later.<span></span> <span>“</span>It increasingly felt like I was trying to empty the ocean with a colander,” she says.<a href="#footnote-28UCM" id="ref-28UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Julia Carrie Wong’s Guardian piece reveals something interesting about Zhang’s reporting chain, which is that Meta’s Vice President of Integrity, Guy Rosen, was one of the people giving her the hardest pushback.</p>
<p>Remember Internet.org, also known as Free Basics, aka Meta’s push to dominate global internet use in all those countries it would go on to<span></span> <span>“</span>deprioritize” and generally ignore?</p>
<p>Guy Rosen, Meta’s then-newish <span>VP</span> of Integrity, <em>is the guy who previously ran Internet.org</em>. He came to lead Integrity directly from being <span>VP</span> of <em>Growth</em>. Before getting acquihired by Meta, Rosen co-founded a company <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-guy-at-the-center-of-facebooks-misinformation-mess">The Information describes</a> as<span></span> <span>“</span>a startup that analyzed what people did on their smartphones.”<a href="#footnote-29UCM" id="ref-29UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Meta bought that startup in 2013, nominally because it would help Internet.org. In a very on-the-nose development, Rosen’s company’s supposedly privacy-protecting <span>VPN</span> software allowed Meta to collect huge amounts of data—so much that Apple booted the app from its store.</p>
<p>So that’s Facebook’s <span>VP</span> of Integrity.</p>
<h2 id="we-simply-didnt-care-enough-to-stop-them"><span>“</span>We simply didn’t care enough to stop them”</h2>
<p>In the <em>Guardian</em>, Julia Carrie Wong reports that in the fall of 2019, Zhang discovered that the Honduras network was back up, and she couldn’t get Meta’s Threat Intelligence team to deal with it. That December, she posted an internal memo about it. Rosen responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook had<span></span> <span>“</span>moved slower than we’d like because of prioritization” on the Honduras case, Rosen wrote.<span></span> <span>“</span>It’s a bummer that it’s back and I’m excited to learn from this and better understand what we need to do systematically,” he added. But he also chastised her for making a public [public as in within Facebook <span>—EK</span>] complaint, saying:<span></span> <span>“</span>My concern is that threads like this can undermine the people that get up in the morning and do their absolute best to try to figure out how to spend the finite time and energy we all have and put their heart and soul into it.”[31]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a private follow-up conversation (still in December, 2019), Zhang alerted Rosen that she’d been told that the Facebook Threat Intelligence team would only prioritize fake networks affecting<span></span> <span>“</span>the US/western Europe and foreign adversaries such as Russia/Iran/etc.”</p>
<p>Rosen told her that he agreed with those priorities. Zhang pushed back (my emphasis):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I get that the US/western Europe/etc is important, but for a company with effectively unlimited resources, I don’t understand why this cannot get on the roadmap for anyone … A strategic response manager told me that <strong>the world outside the US/Europe was basically like the wild west with me as the part-time dictator in my spare time. He considered that to be a positive development because to his knowledge it wasn’t covered by anyone before</strong> he learned of the work I was doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rosen replied,<span></span> <span>“</span>I wish resources were unlimited.”<a href="#footnote-30UCM" id="ref-30UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>I’ll quote Wong’s next passage in full:<span></span> <span>“</span>At the time, the company was about to&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2020/Facebook-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2019-Results/default.aspx">report</a>&nbsp;annual operating profits of $23.9bn on $70.7bn in revenue. It had $54.86bn in cash on hand.”</p>
<p>In early 2020, Zhang’s managers told her she was all done tracking down influence networks—it was time she got back to hunting and erasing<span></span> <span>“</span>vanity likes” from bots instead.</p>
<p>But Zhang believed that if she stopped, no one else would hunt down big, potentially consequential covert influence networks. So she kept doing at least some of it, including advocating for action on an inauthentic Azerbaijan network that appeared to be connected to the country’s ruling party. In an internal group, she wrote that,<span></span> <span>“</span>Unfortunately, Facebook has become complicit by inaction in this authoritarian crackdown.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although we conclusively tied this network to elements of the government in early February, and have compiled extensive evidence of its violating nature, the effective decision was made not to prioritize it, effectively turning a blind eye.”<a href="#footnote-31UCM" id="ref-31UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After those messages, Threat Intelligence decided to act on the network after all.</p>
<p>Then Meta fired Zhang for poor performance.</p>
<p>On her way out the door, Zhang posted a long exit memo—7,800 words—describing what she’d seen. Meta deleted it, so Zhang put up a password-protected version on her own website so her colleagues can see it. So Meta got Zhang’s entire website taken down and her domain deactivated. Eventually Meta got enough employee pressure that it put an edited version back up on their internal site.<a href="#footnote-32UCM" id="ref-32UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, someone <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-ignore-political-manipulation-whistleblower-memo">leaked the memo to Buzzfeed News</a>.</p>
<p>In the memo, Zhang wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve found multiple blatant attempts by foreign national governments to abuse our platform on vast scales to mislead their own citizenry, and caused international news on multiple occasions. I have personally made decisions that affected national presidents without oversight, and taken action to enforce against so many prominent politicians globally that I’ve lost count.<a href="#footnote-33UCM" id="ref-33UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:<span></span> <span>“</span>[T]he truth was, we simply didn’t care enough to stop them.”</p>
<p>On her final day at Meta, Zhang left notes for her colleagues, tallying suspicious accounts involved in political influence campaigns that needed to be investigated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There were 200 suspicious accounts still boosting a politician in Bolivia, she recorded; 100 in Ecuador, 500 in Brazil, 700 in Ukraine, 1,700 in Iraq, 4,000 in India and more than 10,000 in Mexico.<a href="#footnote-34UCM" id="ref-34UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="with-all-due-respect"><span>“</span>With all due respect”</h2>
<p>Zhang’s work at Facebook happened <em>after</em> the wrangling over Russian influence ops that Alex Stamos’ team found. And <em>after</em> the genocide in Myanmar. And <em>after</em> Mark Zuckerberg did his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/business/facebook-myanmar-zuckerberg.html">press-and-government tour</a> about how hard Meta tried and how much better they’d do after Myanmar.<a href="#footnote-35UCM" id="ref-35UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>It was <em>an entire calendar year</em> after the <em>New York Times</em> found the Tatmadaw’s genocide-fueling fake-Page hatefarm that Guy Rosen, Facebook’s <span>VP</span> of Integrity, told Sophie Zhang that the only coordinated fake networks Facebook would take down were the ones that affected the <span>US</span>, Western Europe, and<span></span> <span>“</span>foreign adversaries.”<a href="#footnote-36UCM" id="ref-36UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>In response to Zhang’s disclosures, Rosen later <a href="https://twitter.com/guyro/status/1305613201803943936">hopped onto Twitter</a> to deliver his personal assessment of the networks Zhang found and couldn’t get removed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With all due respect, what she’s described is fake likes—which we routinely remove using automated detection. Like any team in the industry or government, we prioritize stopping the most urgent and harmful threats globally. Fake likes is not one of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://facebookpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Ethnic-violence_Redacted.pdf">One of Frances Haugen’s disclosures</a> includes an internal memo that summarizes Meta’s actual, non-Twitter-snark awareness of the way Facebook has been hollowed out for routine use by covert influence campaigns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We frequently observe highly-coordinated, intentional activity on the <span>FOAS</span> [Family of Apps and Services] by problematic actors, including states, foreign actors, and actors with a record of criminal, violent or hateful behaviour, aimed at promoting social violence, promoting hate, exacerbating ethnic and other societal cleavages, and/or delegitimizing social institutions through misinformation. This is particularly prevalent—and problematic—in At Risk Countries and Contexts.<a href="#footnote-37UCM" id="ref-37UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, they knew.</p>
<p>Because of Haugen’s disclosures, we also know that in 2020, for the category,<span></span> <span>“</span>Remove, reduce, inform/measure misinformation on <span>FB</span> Apps, Includes Community Review and Matching”—so, that’s moderation targeting misinformation specifically—only 13% of the total budget went to the non-US countries that provide more than 90% of Facebook’s user base, and which include <em>all</em> of those At Risk Countries. The other 87% of the budget was reserved for the 10% of Facebook users who live in the United States.<a href="#footnote-38UCM" id="ref-38UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>In case any of this seems disconnected with the main thread of what happened in Myanmar, here’s what (formerly Myanmar-based) researcher Victoire Rio had to say about covert coordinated influence networks in her extremely good <a href="https://toda.org/assets/files/resources/policy-briefs/t-pb-78_victoire-rio_role-of-social-media-in-fomenting-violence-myanmar.pdf">2020 case study about the role of social media in Myanmar’s violence</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bad actors spend months—if not years—building networks of online assets, including accounts, pages and groups, that allow them to manipulate the conversation. These inauthentic presences continue to present a major risk in places like Myanmar and are responsible for the overwhelming majority of problematic content.<a href="#footnote-39UCM" id="ref-39UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that Rio says that these inauthentic networks—the exact things Sophie Zhang chased down until she got fired for it—continued to present a major risk in 2020.</p>
<p>It’s time to skip ahead.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Myanmar in 2021, four years after the peak of the genocide. After everything I’ve dealt with in this whole painfully long series so far, it would be fair to assume that Meta would be prioritizing getting everything right in Myanmar. Especially after the coup.</p>


<p>In 2021, the Tatmadaw deposed Myanmar’s democratically elected government and transferred the leadership of the country to the military’s Commander-in-Chief. Since then, the military has turned the machines of surveillance, administrative repression, torture, and murder that it refined on the Rohingya and other ethnic minorities onto Myanmar’s Buddhist ethnic Bamar majority.</p>
<p><em>Also</em> in 2021, Facebook’s director of policy for <span>APAC</span> Emerging Countries, Rafael Frankel, told the Associated Press that Facebook had now<span></span> <span>“</span>built a dedicated team of over 100 Burmese speakers.”</p>
<p>This<span></span> <span>“</span>dedicated team is,” presumably, the group of contract workers employed by the Accenture-run<span></span> <span>“</span>Project Honey Badger” team in Malaysia.<a href="#footnote-40UCM" id="ref-40UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> (Which, <em>Jesus</em>.)</p>
<p>In October of 2021, the Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-middle-east-religion-europe-a38da3ccd40ffae7e4caa450c374f796">took a look at how that’s working out on Facebook in Myanmar</a>. Right away, they found threatening and violent posts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One 2 1/2 minute&nbsp;video&nbsp;posted on Oct.&nbsp;24 of a supporter of the military calling for violence against opposition groups has garnered over 56,000 views.</p>
<p><span>“</span>So starting from now, we are the god of death for all (of them),” the man says in Burmese while looking into the camera.<span></span> <span>“</span>Come tomorrow and let’s see if you are real men or gays.”</p>
<p>One account posts the home address of a military defector and a photo of his wife. Another post from Oct.&nbsp;29 includes a&nbsp;photo&nbsp;of soldiers leading bound and blindfolded men down a dirt path. The Burmese caption reads,<span></span> <span>“</span>Don’t catch them alive.”<a href="#footnote-41UCM" id="ref-41UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s where content moderation stood in 2021. What about the algorithmic side of things? Is Facebook still boosting dangerous messages in Myanmar?</p>
<p>In the spring of 2021, <a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/digital-threats/algorithm-harm-facebook-amplified-myanmar-military-propaganda-following-coup/">Global Witness analysts made a clean Facebook account with no history</a> and searched for တပ်မ​တော်—“Tatmadaw.” They opened the top page in the results, a military fan page, and found no posts that broke Facebook’s new, stricter rules. Then they hit the<span></span> <span>“</span>like” button, which caused a pop-up with<span></span> <span>“</span>related pages” to appear. Then the team popped open up the first five recommended pages.</p>
<p>Here’s what they found:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Three of the five top page recommendations that Facebook’s algorithm suggested contained content posted after the coup that violated Facebook’s policies.</strong>&nbsp; One of the other pages had content that violated Facebook’s community standards but that was posted before the coup and therefore isn’t included in this article.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Specifically, they found messages that included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Incitement to violence</li>
<li>Content that glorifies the suffering or humiliation of others</li>
<li>Misinformation that can lead to physical harm<a href="#footnote-42UCM" id="ref-42UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As well as several kinds of posts that violated&nbsp;<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/an-update-on-myanmar/">Facebook’s new and more specific policies on Myanmar</a>.</p>
<p>So not only were the violent, violence-promoting posts still showing up in Myanmar four years later after the atrocities in Rakhine State—and after the Tatmadaw turned the full machinery of of its violence onto opposition members of Myanmar’s Buddhist ethnic majority—but <em>Facebook was still funneling users directly into them</em> after even the lightest engagement with anodyne pro-military content.</p>
<p><em>This is in 2021</em>, with Meta throwing vastly more resources at the problem than it ever did during the period leading up to and including the genocide of the Rohingya people. Its algorithms are making <em>active recommendations</em> by Facebook, precisely as outlined in the Meta memos in Haugen’s disclosures.</p>
<p>By any reasonable measure, I think this is a failure.</p>
<p>Meta didn’t respond to requests for comment from Global Witness, but when the <em>Guardian</em> and <span>AP</span> picked up the story, Meta got back to <em>them</em> with…this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our teams continue to closely monitor the situation in Myanmar in real-time and take action on any posts, Pages or Groups that break our rules. <strong>We proactively detect 99 percent of the hate speech removed from Facebook in Myanmar</strong>, and our ban of the Tatmadaw and repeated disruption of coordinated inauthentic behavior has made it harder for people to misuse our services to spread harm.<a href="#footnote-43UCM" id="ref-43UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One more time: This statement <strong>says nothing about how much hate speech is removed</strong>. It’s pure misdirection.</p>
<hr>
<p>Internal Meta memos highlight ways to use Facebook’s algorithmic machinery to sharply reduce the spread of what they called<span></span> <span>“</span>high-harm misinfo.” For those potentially harmful topics, you<span></span> <span>“</span>hard demote” (aka<span></span> <span>“</span>push down” or<span></span> <span>“</span>don’t show”) reshared posts that were originally made by someone who isn’t friended or followed by the viewer. (Frances Haugen talks about this in interviews as<span></span> <span>“</span>cutting the reshare chain.”)</p>
<p>And <em>this method works</em>. In Myanmar,<span></span> <span>“</span>reshare depth demotion” reduced<span></span> <span>“</span>viral inflammatory prevalence” by 25% and cut<span></span> <span>“</span>photo misinformation” almost in half.</p>
<p>In a reasonable world, I think Meta would have decided to broaden use of this method and work on refining it to make it even more effective. What they did, though, was decide to roll it back within Myanmar as soon as the upcoming elections were over.<a href="#footnote-44UCM" id="ref-44UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>The same <span>SEC</span> disclosure I just cited also notes that Facebook’s <span>AI</span> <span></span><span>“</span>classifier” for Burmese hate speech didn’t seem to be maintained or in use—and that algorithmic recommendations were still shuttling people toward violent, hateful messages that violated Facebook’s Community Standards.</p>
<p>So that’s how the algorithms were going. How about the military’s covert influence campaign?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-socialmedia-insight-idAFKBN2HM3BU">Reuters reported in late 2021</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Myanmar’s military seeks to put down protest on the streets, a parallel battle is playing out on social media, with the junta using fake accounts to denounce opponents and press its message that it seized power to save the nation from election fraud…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Reuters reporters explain the military has assigned thousands of the soldiers to wage<span></span> <span>“</span>information combat” in what appears to be an expanded, distributed version of their earlier secret propaganda ops:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“</span>Soldiers are asked to create several fake accounts and are given content segments and talking points that they have to post,” said Captain Nyi Thuta, who defected from the army to join rebel forces at the end of February.<span></span> <span>“</span>They also monitor activity online and join (anti-coup) online groups to track them.” <a href="#footnote-45UCM" id="ref-45UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(We know this because Reuters journalists got hold of a high-placed defector from the Tatmadaw’s propaganda wing.)</p>
<p>When asked for comment, Facebook’s regional Director of Public Policy told Reuters that Meta<span></span> <span>“</span>‘proactively’ detected almost 98 percent of the hate speech removed from its platform in Myanmar.”</p>
<h2 id="wasting-our-lives-under-tarpaulin"><span>“</span>Wasting our lives under tarpaulin”</h2>
<p>The Rohingya people forced to flee Myanmar have scattered across the region, but the overwhelming majority of those who fled in 2017 ended up in the Cox’s Bazar region of Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The camps are beyond overcrowded, and they make everyone who lives in them vulnerable to the region’s seasonal flooding, to worsening climate impacts, and to waves of disease. This year, the refugees’ <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/news/stories/rohingya-refugees-face-hunger-and-loss-hope-after-latest-ration-cuts">food aid was just cut from the equivalent of $12 a month to $8 month</a>, because the international community is focused elsewhere.<a href="#footnote-46UCM" id="ref-46UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/burma-myanmar/new-cold-war-hein-myers">complex geopolitical situation surrounding post-coup Myanmar</a>—in which many western and Asian countries condemn the situation in Myanmar, but don’t act lest they push the Myanmar junta further toward China—seems likely to ensure a long, bloody conflict, with no relief in sight for the Rohingya.<a href="#footnote-47UCM" id="ref-47UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>The <span>UN</span> estimates that <a href="https://data.unhcr.org/en/country/bgd">more than 960,000 Rohingya refugees</a> now live in refugee camps in Bangladesh. More than half are children, few of whom have had much education at all since coming to the camps six years ago. The <span>UN</span> estimates that the refugees needed about $70.5 million for education in 2022, of which 1.6% was actually funded. <a href="#footnote-48UCM" id="ref-48UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Amnesty International spoke with Mohamed Junaid, a 23-year-old Rohingya volunteer math and chemistry teacher, who is also a refugee. He told Amnesty:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though there were many restrictions in Myanmar, we could still do school until matriculation at least. But in the camps our children cannot do anything. We are wasting our lives under tarpaulin.<a href="#footnote-49UCM" id="ref-49UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In their report,<span></span> <span>“</span>The Social Atrocity,” Amnesty wrote that in 2020, seven Rohingya youth organizations based in the refugee camps made a formal application to Meta’s Director of Human Rights. They requested that, given its role in the crises that led to their expulsion from Myanmar, Meta provide just <em>one</em> million dollars in funding to support a teacher-training initiative within the camps—a way to give the refugee children a chance at an education that might someday serve them in the outside world.</p>
<p>Meta got back to the Rohingya youth organizations in 2021, a year in which the company cleared $39.3B in profits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, after discussing with our teams, this specific proposal is not something that we’re able to support. As I think we noted in our call, Facebook doesn’t directly engage in philanthropic activities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/digital-threats/rohingya-facebook-hate-speech/">In 2022, Global Witness came back for one more look at Meta’s operations in Myanmar</a>, this time with eight examples of real hate speech aimed at the Rohingya—actual posts from the period of the genocide, all taken from the <span>UN</span> Human Rights Council findings I’ve been linking to so frequently in this series. They submitted these real-life examples of hate speech to Meta as Burmese-language Facebook advertisements.</p>
<p>Meta accepted all eight ads.<a href="#footnote-50UCM" id="ref-50UCM" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

					<p itemprop="description">
						Berry is a ultra-lightweight dynamically typed embedded scripting language. It is designed for lower-performance embedded devices. The Berry interpreter-core's code size is less than 40KiB and can run on less than 4KiB heap (on ARM Cortex M4 CPU, Thumb ISA and ARMCC compiler).
					</p>
					<p>
						The interpreter of Berry include a one-pass compiler and register-based VM, all the code is written in ANSI C99. In Berry not every type is a class object. Some simple value types, such as int, real, boolean and string are not class object, but list, map and range are class object. This is a consideration about performance. Register-based VM is the same meaning as above.

							<h2>Lightweight</h2>
							<p>
								A well-optimized interpreter with very little resources. Ideal for use in microprocessors.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h2>Fast</h2>
							<p>
								Optimized one-pass bytecode compiler and register-based virtual machine.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h2>Powerful</h2>
							<p>
								Supports imperative programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h2>Flexible</h2>
							<p>
								Berry is a dynamic type script, and it's intended for embedding in applications. It can provide good dynamic scalability for the host system.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h2>Simple</h2>
							<p>
								Simple and natural syntax, support garbage collection, and easy to use FFI (foreign function interface).
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h2>RAM saving</h2>
							<p>
								With compile-time object construction, most of the constant objects are stored in read-only code data segments, so the RAM usage of the interpreter is very low when it starts.

								<h3>Simple and intuitive syntax</h3>
								<p>
									The Berry language syntax is similar to that of high-level languages and will be familiar to most programmers.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
<pre><span>var</span> list <span>= [</span> <span>"Hello"</span><span>,</span> <span>"World"</span> ]
<span>for</span> text <span>:</span> list
    <span>print</span><span>(</span>text<span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<div>
								<h3>Map Instance</h3>
								<p>
									The map class is a built-in class type that is used to provide an unordered container of key-value pairs. Within the Berry interpreter, map map uses the Hash table to implement. You can use key-value pairs to construct a map container.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
<pre><span>var</span> map <span>= {</span>
    <span>'greets'</span><span>:</span> <span>def</span><span>()</span> <span>return</span> <span>'Hi!</span> <span>Berry</span><span>' </span><span>end</span> <span>()</span><span>,</span>
<span>    '</span><span>say</span><span>'   : '</span><span>Hello World</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
<span>    '</span><span>sum</span><span>'   : </span><span>10</span> <span>+</span> <span>50</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>for</span> i <span>:</span> map<span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>()</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span>i<span>,</span> <span>"\t=&gt;"</span><span>,</span> map<span>[</span>i<span>]</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<div>
								<h3>Object Orientation</h3>
								<p>
									To use a class, you must first declare it. The declaration of a class begins with the keyword class.
								</p>
								<p>
									The member variables and methods of the class must be specified in the declaration. This is an example of class declaration:
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
<pre><span>import</span> <span>string</span>

<span>class</span> Parent
    <span>#- member variables  -#</span>
    <span>var</span> fname
    <span>var</span> cname

    <span>#- constructor -#</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>init</span><span>()</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span>fname <span>=</span> <span>'Darth vader'</span>
    <span>end</span>

									Here the Child class inherits from the Parent class. The subclass will inherit all the methods and properties of the Parent class, and you can override them in the subclass. This mechanism is called Overload.

				<p id="speakable-summary">Brave Software, the maker of Brave Browser and Search, confirmed that it has laid off 9% of its staff across departments.</p>
<p>The company didn’t specify how many people were affected, but it corroborated the development and said the decision was driven by the tough economic climate.</p>
<p>“Brave eliminated some positions as part of our cost management in this challenging economic environment. Several departments were affected, amounting to 9% of our staff,” a company spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement.</p>
<p>The company has been taking steps to bolster its revenue sources this year. In April, Brave Search ditched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/28/brave-search-doesnt-use-bings-index-anymore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bing Index to start relying on its own indexing solution</a>. In May, the company released its <a href="https://brave.com/search-api-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own search API</a> for clients with plans starting from $3 per 1,000 queries. The API also offers different plans for AI data model training, data with storage rights, spellcheck, and autosuggest. Last month, Brave introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/privacy-focused-brave-search-launches-its-own-image-and-video-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image, news, and video results</a> as a part of its Search API.</p>
<p>Brave has also been testing a native AI assistant called Leo for its browser. While it plans to make it available to all users, Brave said that Leo will have<a href="https://brave.com/leo-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a premium tier</a> with features like higher rate limits and access to more conversation models. The company noted that this will help it pay for the cost of API access and hosting.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>In my previous article, I provided a comprehensive overview of my homelab. If you haven't had a chance to read it yet but are interested, you can find it at <a href="https://nerdyarticles.com/my-homelab-a-general-overview/">here</a>. In the upcoming articles, I'll delve into detailed guides on how to create a homelab like mine. However, from time to time, like now, I like to shift the focus and spotlight a service or project I'm particularly fond of.</p><p>In this article, I'll explore what Paperless-ngx (we'll call it Paperless for short) is and the benefits it offers. I'll also share how I've structured my Paperless installation. Finally, I'll provide my code for you to use in setting up your own instance. For now, I'll assume you already have a functional Docker environment ready to deploy your Paperless instance.</p><p>Introducing <a href="https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/?ref=nerdyarticles.com">Paperless-ngx</a>, your key to simplifying life by going digital! Are you tired of hunting for crucial documents when doing your taxes? With Paperless, that hassle is a thing of the past. This fantastic tool has built-in OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and learns from your categorized documents, making it a breeze to organize your files. Say goodbye to endless diggin through folders – now, all your essential documents are just a few clicks away. Once you've given Paperless a try for a while, you'll find that it consistently gets things right, reducing the need for manual adjustments. Say hello to a more streamlined and efficient way of managing your documents!</p><p>The big benefit of going digital in this space? Flexibility! Unlike traditional paper-based or folder-organized digital systems, your documents can belong to multiple categories at once. Ever wrestled with the dilemma of deciding which folder a document should go into? That's because it often fits more than one category. The solution? Tags. With a digital solution like Paperless, you can assign as many tags as you need, making categorization a breeze. Say goodbye to the folder confusion!</p><hr><h2 id="paperless-a-living-proof-of-open-source-greatness">Paperless: A Living Proof of Open Source Greatness</h2><p>In short: Paperless transitioned into Paperless-ng and then into Paperless-ngx</p><p><a href="https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless?ref=nerdyarticles.com">Paperless</a> was initiated by Daniel Quinn, with his initial commit to the GitHub project dating back to 6th June 2016. The version 1 release came on 3rd July 2018 (with the first release, 0.3.0, launched on 1st January 2017). The last release under Daniel Quinn's was on 27th January 2019.</p><p>As the original project began to lose momentum, Jonas Winkler's fork <a href="https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng?ref=nerdyarticles.com">Paperless-ng</a> emerged as the official successor. The first release (0.9) occurred on 18th November 2020, and the final release before the current transition was on 22nd August 2021.</p><p>At the time of writing this, <a href="https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx?ref=nerdyarticles.com">Paperless-ngx</a> is the official version and repository, having its inaugural release on 05th March 2022.</p><p>This journey exemplifies the strength of the open-source community. Even if a project experiences slowdowns or transitions, passionate contributors ensure its legacy lives on and continues to evolve.</p><p>Let's explore Paperless and my adoption of it. There are various approaches to adopting it, so find what suits you best. What works for me might just be the right fit for you too, or you might discover your own path along the way.</p><figure><img src="https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/2023/10/Paperless---Documents-Screenshot-blurred.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1892" height="958" srcset="https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/Paperless---Documents-Screenshot-blurred.png 600w, https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/Paperless---Documents-Screenshot-blurred.png 1000w, https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/Paperless---Documents-Screenshot-blurred.png 1600w, https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/2023/10/Paperless---Documents-Screenshot-blurred.png 1892w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>The documents view in Paperless-ngx</figcaption></figure><p>Here are the key feature of Paperless:</p><ol><li><strong>Document Management:</strong> Organize and manage your digital documents efficiently in the web.</li><li><strong>Tagging System:</strong> Easily categorize documents with tags for quick access.</li><li><strong>OCR Integration:</strong> Optical Character Recognition for extracting text from images and scanned documents.</li><li><strong>Automatic Categorization:</strong> Learns from your tags and categories to auto-classify future documents.</li><li><strong>Search Functionality:</strong> Powerful search capabilities to find documents swiftly.</li><li><strong>Multi-User Support:</strong> Collaborate with others by setting up multiple user accounts.</li><li><strong>Data Export:</strong> Export your documents and data for backup or migration purposes. They are also kept in a very neat folder structure and naming convention, enabling you to ditch Paperless without any effort.</li></ol><h2 id="from-paper-to-pixels-which-documents-belong-in-your-digital-vault">From Paper to Pixels: Which Documents Belong in Your Digital Vault?</h2><p>I'm in Germany, so these rules may not apply to you. Always do your own research. I am only sharing what I am doing and not advising you to do the same.</p><p>Generally, I digitize what I'd put in a physical folder, which is not be every letter from banks, insurers, etc. </p><p>The next choice is whether to keep the physical copy or go digital only (make sure you have a proofen backup solution). In Germany, you must keep physical copies of certificates, notarized docs, property papers, vehicle papers, specific financial docs (contract-related, not just statements), insurance policies, passports, and ID cards. I shred and dispose of any document that don't require a physical copy. Fortunately, many documents are digital these days, saving me from making that decision and scanning them.</p><hr><h2 id="tagging-document-types-and-correspondents-my-organizational-secrets">Tagging, Document Types, and Correspondents: My Organizational Secrets</h2><p>To stay organized and efficient, it's crucial to consider document types, tags, and correspondents.</p><h3 id="correspondents">Correspondents</h3><p>This part is straightforward. Every sender of documents you upload to Paperless becomes a correspondent. You can add new correspondents on the fly when you review new documents. </p><p>I do make exceptions; for instance, invoices from online shops are assigned to 'Online Shops' rather than having their own correspondent. Thanks to the full-text search, finding what I need is easy within the hundreds of documents in the system.</p><h3 id="document-types">Document Types</h3><p>I put a lot of thought into document types when setting up Paperless, but rarely ever need them. Although I don't use them often, they don't hurt as Paperless is self-learning. </p><p>Here are the types I've set up: </p><ul><li>Invoice</li><li>Letter</li><li>Insurance</li><li>Contract</li><li>Other</li></ul><h3 id="tags">Tags</h3><p>Remember what we discussed earlier? Folders, whether they're physical or digital, limit us to just one category per document. Tags give us the power to assign multiple categories to a single document. So, go ahead, be a tagging superstar and create as many categories as your heart desires (and even assign them all to one document). It's your very own organizational playground!</p><p>In my experience, simplicity beats complexity. Keep it straightforward, no need for over-detailing. Plus, we've got this fantastic search feature to help you find what you need in a snap!</p><p>Now, let's dive into the magical world of tags.</p><h4 id="whos-affected">Who's Affected?</h4><p>I find it helpful to use distinct tags for the people the documents affect:</p><ul><li>Wife</li><li>Me</li><li>Family (for example all bills around the house, shared insurances, ...)</li></ul><h4 id="which-categories-are-affected">Which Categories Are Affected?</h4><p>I also like to create specific groupings to easily access all related documents.</p><ul><li>Car (You could also create a tag per car you own.)</li><li>Doctor</li><li>Expenses</li><li>House (Have more real estate? Create a tag per property.)</li><li>ToDo (Will cover this later.)</li></ul><p>For a smooth tax season, I rely on my tax tags, which make finding relevant documents a breeze.</p><ul><li>Tax (A general tag for all tax relevant documents.)</li><li>Tax always (I have documents, which are relevant for every year.)</li><li>Tax 2021</li><li>Tax 2022</li><li>Tax 2023</li><li>...</li></ul><p>Documents like insurance papers, which are relevant for more than one year, usually have three tax tags: the general one and the two for the years they are relevant for.</p><hr><h2 id="digitalization-made-easy-uploading-to-paperless-ngx">Digitalization Made Easy: Uploading to Paperless-ngx</h2><p>Now that everything is set up for organizing our documents, you might wonder how to get them in there. It's a straightforward process, with three simple methods (not counting potential mobile apps as a fourth option).</p><p>This is also where the 'ToDo' tag comes into play. Regardless of how the documents are imported into Paperless, the ToDo tag is set. I have created a so-called 'view', which displays all documents with the ToDo tag, and added that view to my homepage. This is essentially my inbox in Paperless, which I go through from time to time to check if everything is set correctly.</p><figure><img src="https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/2023/10/Paperless---Homescreen-Screenshot.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1899" height="952" srcset="https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/Paperless---Homescreen-Screenshot.png 600w, https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/Paperless---Homescreen-Screenshot.png 1000w, https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/Paperless---Homescreen-Screenshot.png 1600w, https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/2023/10/Paperless---Homescreen-Screenshot.png 1899w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>The Paperless-ngx start screen with documents in my 'inbox'.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="uploading">Uploading</h3><p>In your web browser, click the upload button, select your file(s), and click upload. For an even easier method, just drag and drop your file(s) into the Paperless browser window, no matter where you are in Paperless. It's that simple!</p><h3 id="email-inbox">Email Inbox</h3><p>You can have Paperless periodically scan a specific email inbox and import files from there. It could be your standard inbox, and you watch for a certain topic or folder, or you just set up a new inbox and forward emails with documents you want to import to that inbox. This is what I do, and let's have a quick look at how to set that up.</p><p>After you have added an email inbox to monitor in the settings, you can specify what the importer will actually watch for and do.</p><figure><img src="https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/2023/10/Paperless---Mail-rule-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1136" height="812" srcset="https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/Paperless---Mail-rule-1.png 600w, https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/Paperless---Mail-rule-1.png 1000w, https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/2023/10/Paperless---Mail-rule-1.png 1136w"><figcaption>Settings for the email importer</figcaption></figure><p>What you can see in the picture above is that my rule 'Main Importer' will import from 'Paperless Mail Inbox' (the name I gave the configuration of the email inbox to monitor). It watches the folder 'INBOX', processes all PDF documents, uses the file's name as the document name, sets the 'ToDo' tag, and deletes the email. </p><p>Don't worry about the 'Do not assign a correspondent' option; this actually means that the self-learning algorithm will try to set the correct correspondent.</p><h3 id="auto-import-from-a-folder">Auto import from a folder</h3><p>You can also have Paperless watch a specific folder and import all documents from there. This is especially useful if you already have many digital documents you want to import initially or if you have a scanner with the ability to scan to a network share.</p><hr><h2 id="effortless-editing-perfecting-your-documents">Effortless Editing: Perfecting Your Documents</h2><p>Paired with the OCR process and the self-learning algorithm, editing newly added documents is very easy and fast. Remember, though, that the self-learning algorithm needs to learn from your documents. Any new correspondent will definitely be wrong, as it will try to set a known correspondent. After some time, it will become a matter of just making sure everything is correct.</p><p>The title is something I neraly always redo, to make it very meaningful, in order to identify the document very quickly.</p><p>I have learned that the it also is a tricky part to set the right date. There are a few to choose from (dates from the files meta data, dates in the header, or any other dates mentioned in the document). It gets it right most times, but do pay attention to it.</p><figure><img src="https://nerdyarticles.com/content/images/2023/10/Paperless---Edit-Window-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="522" height="697"><figcaption>Editing view for Paperless-ngx documents</figcaption></figure><p>In the above screenshot, you can see a freshly imported document, which I can now check if everything is correct. Is it a new correspondent? No need to leave the window; you can create it straight from the input field here, same for the Document Type and Tags.</p><p>The archive serial number can also be very useful (I don't use it). The serial number will automatically count upwards by one from the last serial number used. You can then write this number on the physical document and just put it in a folder, without any extra organization. Are you now looking for a document, just look up the serial number, identify the folder, ...</p><p>The last step when I am done is removing the 'ToDo' tag and 'Save &amp; Close' the document.</p><p>You've come a long way (or maybe you jumped ahead to grab my Docker config). Now, let's chat about how I've configured my Paperless instance to run in Docker. To make this work, we'll need three containers: a database (usually PostgreSQL, which I prefer), a Redis broker for scheduled tasks, and, of course, Paperless-ngx itself.</p><h2 id="redis-container">Redis Container</h2><p>Alright, let's kick things off with the easiest part: the Redis broker.</p><pre><code>paperless-redis:
  container_name: paperless-redis
  image: redis:7.2-alpine #fixedVersion
  restart: unless-stopped
  networks:
    - backend
  security_opt:
    - no-new-privileges:true
  volumes:
    - ./paperless/redis:/data
  environment:
    REDIS_ARGS: "--save 60 10"</code></pre><p>Here are some important points to highlight in my Docker Compose code for the Redis broker:</p><p><strong>Naming Convention:</strong> I use a naming convention for supporting services, where it's structured as &lt;Name of the supported service&gt;-&lt;Name of the supporting service&gt;. In this case, it's 'paperless-redis,' and this convention applies to both the service and container name.</p><p><strong>Fixed Image Version:</strong> I always specify a fixed image version for supporting services. This helps prevent issues when upgrading the Docker stack. It ensures that the version I'm using is compatible with my main service. This is particularly crucial for databases, where version mismatches can require migration steps.</p><p><strong>Docker Networks:</strong> I organize my Docker containers into two networks:</p><ul><li><strong>Frontend:</strong> This network is for services that run behind my reverse proxy and require outside access (outside means outside of the server running docker).</li><li><strong>Backend:</strong> This network is for services that solely support other services and don't need outside access.</li></ul><p><strong>Container Privileges:</strong> I specify that the container cannot have additional privileges, which enhances security.</p><p><strong>Bind Mount (Volume Path):</strong> I follow a specific structure for the bind mount (volume path). It starts with a folder named after the main service and then includes a subfolder named after the supporting service. This organization makes it easy to remove a specific configuration if I decide to discard something I've experimented with.</p><p><strong>Redis Configuration:</strong> Specific to Redis, I set an environment variable that instructs it to save its state to disk every 60 seconds or after 10 write operations. This ensures data durability.</p><p>If you're wondering why there's no port setting, it's because we're working within a Docker network. We can access the container ports without explicitly defining them here. The port definition creates a port mapping between the container and the host machine/VM.</p><div data-kg-toggle-state="close"><div><h4>Warning: Ports ignore firewall rules</h4></div><p>It's worth noting that the default Docker network (bridge network) isn't affected by rules from an iptables-based firewall. I'll dive deeper into this in an upcoming article about securing your Docker setup.</p></div><h2 id="postgresql-container">PostgreSQL Container</h2><p>When it comes to databases in my self-hosting setup, I'm a fan of PostgreSQL. It's my preferred choice. In the case of Paperless-ngx, it defaults to PostgreSQL, but you do have the option to run MariaDB if that's your preference. I personally also always deploy a DB per service and do not reuse the same DB twice.</p><p>Let's have a look at the docker compose of the database.</p><pre><code>paperless-postgres:
  container_name: paperless-postgres
  image: postgres:16.0-alpine #fixedVersion
  restart: unless-stopped
  networks:
    - backend
  security_opt:
    - no-new-privileges:true
  volumes:
    - ./paperless/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  environment:
    POSTGRES_USER: DBUSERNAME
    POSTGRES_DB: DBNAME
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/paperless_db_paperless_passwd
    #POSTGRES_PASSWORD: $PasswordFromEnvFile
  secrets:
    - paperless_db_paperless_passwd</code></pre><p>I prefer to use a docker secret for the password if the image supports it. I've also included a commented-out line for providing the password via a .env file if you prefer that method.</p><p>Since I'm using a secret, I need to map it appropriately. I'll be covering the use of secrets in a future article about securing your Docker environment. Stay tuned for that!</p><h2 id="paperless-ngx-container">Paperless-ngx Container</h2><p>Finally, let's get to the main reason you're here: the Docker Compose configuration for my Paperless-ngx container.</p><pre><code>paperless:
  container_name: paperless
  image: ghcr.io/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx:latest
  restart: unless-stopped
  networks:
    - frontend
    - backend
  ports:
    - 8000:8000
  security_opt:
    - no-new-privileges:true
  depends_on:
    - paperless-redis
    - paperless-postgres
  volumes:
    - ./paperless/paperless:/usr/src/paperless/data # Docker container data
    - ./paperless/paperless:/usr/src/paperless/media # Location of your documents
    - ./paperless/paperless:/usr/src/paperless/export # Target for backups
    - ./paperless/paperless:/usr/src/paperless/consume # Watch folder
  environment:
    USERMAP_UID: $PUID
    USERMAP_GID: $PGID
    PAPERLESS_TIME_ZONE: $TZ
    PAPERLESS_OCR_LANGUAGE: deu+eng
    PAPERLESS_REDIS: redis://paperless-redis:6379
    PAPERLESS_DBHOST: paperless-postgres
    PAPERLESS_DBNAME: DBNAME
    PAPERLESS_DBUSER: DBUSERNAME
    PAPERLESS_DBPASS_FILE: /run/secrets/paperless_db_paperless_passwd
    #PAPERLESS_DBPASS: $PAPERLESS_DBPASS
    PAPERLESS_SECRET_KEY_FILE: /run/secrets/paperless_secret_key
    #PAPERLESS_SECRET_KEY: $PAPERLESS_SECRET_KEY
    PAPERLESS_FILENAME_FORMAT: "{created_year}/{correspondent}/{created} {title}"
    PAPERLESS_URL: "&lt;YOUR PAPERLESS URL&gt;"
    PAPERLESS_ALLOWED_HOSTS: PAPERLESS_URL</code></pre><p>Let's take a closer look at some of the specific details in the Docker Compose configuration:</p><p><strong>Networks:</strong> We join both networks because we want Paperless to communicate with the reverse proxy (not setup or covered in this article) and other services on the backend network.</p><p><strong>Ports:</strong> To access Paperless from other devices on your local network, we create a port mapping, which would not be needed when using a reverse proxy.</p><p><strong>Depends On:</strong> This ensures that the specified containers are running before starting Paperless.</p><p><strong>Volumes:</strong> We use volumes for data persistence, including our documents and Paperless configuration. I usually use NFS mounts for media, export, and consume which go straight to my NAS. For simplicity, bind mounts are used here.</p><h3 id="environment-variables">Environment Variables</h3><p><strong><a href="https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/configuration/?ref=nerdyarticles.com#USERMAP_UID">USERMAP_UID</a> &amp; <a href="https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/configuration/?ref=nerdyarticles.com#USERMAP_GID">USERMAP_GID</a>:</strong> It's a good practice to set these to the IDs of your personal user on the Docker host system.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>At least 1,000 birds died from colliding into a single building in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chicago" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Chicago</a> on Thursday, 5 October, as they migrated south to their wintering grounds. Volunteers are still recovering bird carcasses within 1.5 miles of McCormick Place, the largest convention center in North America, which is largely covered with glass.</p><figure id="c0ed8bc4-3e0f-4a18-86ea-c0e2140ffd11" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:1,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/07/nyc-migrating-birds-night-lights-architecture&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;New York’s plan to save birds from crashing into buildings: lights out&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;c0ed8bc4-3e0f-4a18-86ea-c0e2140ffd11&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>“It’s the tip of an iceberg but it’s it’s a huge, huge amount of birds we found both dead and injured,” said Annette Prince, director of Chicago Bird Collision Monitors, adding that this was the highest number of bird strikes that the group recorded from the grounds of one building in a single day.</p><p>From late Wednesday, 4 October, through early Thursday, 5 October, a peak estimate of <a href="https://dashboard.birdcast.info/region/US-IL-031?night=2023-10-04" data-link-name="in body link">1.5 million</a> birds were in the air over Cook county, home to the Chicago metropolitan area. Carcasses of <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Tennessee_Warbler/id#" data-link-name="in body link">Tennessee warblers</a>, <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Hermit_Thrush/id#" data-link-name="in body link">hermit thrush</a>, <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/American_Woodcock/id" data-link-name="in body link">American woodcocks</a> and other varieties of songbirds were recovered.</p><p>“Not every bird that hits the window is going to leave behind a body,” said Brendon Samuels, who researches bird window collisions at the University of Western Ontario.</p><p>He noted that the true extent of affected birds will unravel over a couple of days as people continue to pick up birds around downtown Chicago.</p><p>“In fact, we often see birds collide with glass and they continue flying some distance away, seriously injured in ways that ultimately they won’t survive past a few hours,” Samuels added.</p><p>Birds <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/07/nyc-migrating-birds-night-lights-architecture" data-link-name="in body link">dying</a> in large numbers in a small geographic area tends to occur during peak migration periods in spring and fall. Weather conditions like opposing wind, rain and fog can make it difficult for birds to orientate themselves, in addition to light pollution from cities that can draw them in and trap them among deadly structures.</p><p>“Anywhere you’ve got glass, you’re gonna have birds hitting the windows,” said Bryan Lenz at the American Bird Conservancy. Annually, up to a <a href="https://abcbirds.org/blog/truth-about-birds-and-glass-collisions/" data-link-name="in body link">billion</a> birds die due to collisions, and in the case of Chicago, the dead and injured birds were most likely flying from Canada en route to South and Central America.</p><p>Everywhere birds visit, they perform essential ecosystem services that have economic value and are necessary for the functioning of ecosystems. Following major wildfires like those in Canada, birds that return to burned areas can disperse <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320712004247#:~:text=Remnant%20trees%20or%20artificial%20perches,shrubs%20in%20post%2Dfire%20areas." data-link-name="in body link">seeds</a> and aid forest landscape regeneration. Global increases in temperatures contribute to the increase in <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/ccrc/topics/insect-disturbance-and-climate-change#:~:text=forest%20insect%20species.-,In%20some%20cases%2C%20larger%20and%20more%20frequent%20insect%20outbreaks%20may,to%20forest%20insect%20population%20growth." data-link-name="in body link">insect populations</a>, and birds that feed on them can help curb the issues that pose a threat for humans and food systems.</p><p>Of all cities in the US, Chicago’s light pollution poses the greatest risk for migrating birds. Turning off building lights is one way to reduce fatalities. A 2021 <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2101666118" data-link-name="in body link">study</a> done in McCormick Place, the same site of Thursday’s bird deaths, found that shutting off half the lights in large buildings can reduce collisions by six to 11 times. McCormick Place is a participant of the <a href="https://www.mccormickplace.com/birds/" data-link-name="in body link">Lights Out Chicago</a> program, which has buildings voluntarily switch off or dim lights at night unless someone is inside.</p><p>“It is important to understand that there is an event going on at Lakeside Center [part of McCormick Place] this week, so, therefore, the lights have been on when occupied. Once the space is unoccupied, the lights have been turned off,” said a representative from McCormick Place.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-12">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-12" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>“It’s a known hazard, and yet we still can’t see action being taken about it,” says Prince.</p><p>Having window glass with visual markers like dots or patterns can break up the appearance of reflection and let birds recognize whether there is a safe passage for them to fly through.</p><p>In 2020, Chicago approved a bird-friendly design ordinance but it is yet to take effect. In 2021, the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, signed the Bird Safe Buildings Act, which “requires bird-friendly design to be incorporated into the construction and renovation of state-owned buildings” in the state, per <a href="https://gl.audubon.org/news/new-law-will-protect-illinois-birds-deadly-building-collisions" data-link-name="in body link">Audobon.org</a>.</p><p>“We have a lot of existing buildings that are killing birds, not just new construction,” said Samuels, adding that investments in retrofits, creating tax credits for such environmental initiatives and making windows more bird-friendly can be an economical way to solve this. “We already have solutions, we just need to put those into policy.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/90-new-server-design/">https://www.marginalia.nu/log/90-new-server-design/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37800753">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>So the search engine is moving to a new server soon, thanks to the generous grant
<a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/88-futo-grant/">mentioned recently</a>.</p><p>If you visit search.marginalia.nu now, it may or may not use the old or new server. It’ll be like this for
a while, since I need them both for testing and maintenance type work.</p><p>I’ll also apologize if this post is a bit chaotic. It is a reflection of a very chaotic couple of weeks that
apart from setting up this migration also involved a very short notice invitation for a
presentation at <a href="https://opensearchfoundation.org/en/events-osf/5th-international-open-search-symposium-ossym2023/">ossym23</a>.</p><p>This project seems to generate a lot of goodwill from the technologically inclined,
so when I went to order the server, they sent me an email stating they liked what I was
doing and offered a free CPU upgrade. From dual Epyc 7443 to 7543. Thanks <a href="https://mullet.se/">Mullet
Scandinavia!</a> (Swedish website).</p><p><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/90-new-server-design/server.jpeg" alt="New server"></p><p>So the server’s a big beefy one. The machine has 512 GB of RAM and 10x8 plus 2x4 TB SSDs,
and the aforementioned dual Epyc 7543s for a whopping 128 logical cores.</p><p>Some decisions needed to be made about how to deploy the search engine
onto the server. The software will need some modifications to make
good use of the hardware, but that’s a later worry.</p><h2 id="os-setup">OS Setup</h2><p>We’re going Debian Bookworm.</p><p>The idea has always been to skip RAID for the index drives and run multiple index
partitions on at least 8 of the 8 TB drives, keeping the other two for spare storage
space, testing, and ready to be wiped and repurposed with short notice.</p><p>If a drive croaks, 12.5% of the index needs to be reconstructed on one of the
two spare drives, which would be an inconvenience and a temporary loss of capacity
but it’s not catastrophic end of the world type stuff.</p><p>Since most of what search engines do is embarassingly parallel along
the axis of domains, this basic design makes sense. The machine has
64 physical cores and a bunch of disks, so we want to put them all to
work where possible.</p><p>Keeping each shard on a different physical disk by design reduces
resource contention, which is desirable since the expected access
pattern will be a shotgun blast of requests hitting each partition
at the exact same time, triggering an intense flurry of reads.</p><h2 id="page-faults">Page Faults</h2><p>There are still lingering concerns with this approach. The software
is based around memory mapped storage, and Linux’ page fault handler
can only put up with so many page faults at any given time.</p><p>A potential way around this is virtualization, to run multiple operating
systems on the same machine.</p><p>There are clear drawbacks with this. Each operating system essentially gets
a fixed allocation of RAM, something like 32-48 GB. This can lead to quite a lot of
wasted resources, VM #3 may really need 64 GB instead of 48 GB at a point
where VM #4 may have 24 GB to spare. The single-machine paradigm will permit
large processing jobs to borrow small amounts of RAM from each partition without
disruption.</p><p>I think the drawbacks of virtualization outweigh the benefits here. It’s probably
easier to re-code the index to reduce the amount of page faults if necessary than to reclaim the
wasted RAM and resources. It’s also very hard to backpedal on a setup
like this, it would essentially entail wiping the entire server and rebulding it
from scratch, storing dozens of terabytes of crawl data god knows where in the
meantime.</p><p>A core value for the project is to make the best use of the hardware available. Much
of what you’d consider conventional wisdom in this field is based around the assumption
of hardware being cheap, and development being expensive. In this project, it is the other
way around, even now with a server 10X as powerful as the previous one.</p><h2 id="resilience-and-recovery">Resilience and recovery</h2><p>Having more important hard drives increases the odds of disk failure in the same way throwing
more dice increases the chance of rolling a 1. Disk failure needs to be considered
a real possibility and factored into the design.</p><p>There are two failure modes.</p><h3 id="single-disk-error">Single Disk Error</h3><p>One of the two OS disks can fail without any interruption to operations, thanks to RAID1.</p><p>In the scenario where one of the index disks were to fail, the capacity of the
system will drop by 12.5% for about a day. At this point one of the two spare drives
will be repurposed into a new index disk. This capacity drop is a tolerable inconvenience.</p><h3 id="disaster">Disaster</h3><p>In the case of a more unlikely scenario, with multiple simultaneous failure of several drives, the system is designed to be <em>eventually</em> recoverable from just scraps of the data. With the design proposed, you’d need simultaneous failure of seven hard different drives to put a permanent end to operations.</p><ul><li>You can regenerate the crawl data from the domain database (RAID 1).</li><li>You can regenerate the index from crawl data.</li><li>You can regenerate the domain database from crawl data.</li><li>You can regenerate the index from index backups.</li><li>You can regenerate the domain database from database backups (2 physical disks, also hot spare).</li></ul><p>Some of this is accomplished by using a daisy-chained data layout where disk N carries the Nth index, crawl data for shard (N-1), and index-backups for shard (N+1). Thus to eradicate all knowledge of shard 3, disks 2, 3 and 4 would need to die along with both the backup disks and both the main OS disks.</p><p><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/90-new-server-design/factorio.png" alt="In which a thousand hours of Factorio shine through"></p><h2 id="daisy-daisy">Daisy, daisy…</h2><p>This design has every potential to become difficult to reason about without careful thought being put into the execution.</p><p>The sane way of accomplishing this disk assignment scheme is to have one directory of mounted disk partitions, and to use a parallel tree of symlinks to accomplish the distribution, and then have the code only interact with the symlinks while the operating system deals with the rest.</p><p>Like so:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>/app/index/1/backup  -&gt;   /disk/2/backup
/app/index/1/current -&gt;   /disk/1/current
/app/index/1/storage -&gt;   /disk/0/storage
/app/index/1/work    -&gt;   /disk/1/work

/app/index/2/backup  -&gt;   /disk/3/backup
/app/index/2/current -&gt;   /disk/2/current
/app/index/2/storage -&gt;   /disk/1/storage
/app/index/2/work    -&gt;   /disk/2/work

...
</code></pre><h2 id="software">Software</h2><p>Finally, a note about adapting the software. The first stage migration will just
run the existing code on a single partition, but moving forward, the aim is to make
modifications to be able to have multiple backing indexes.</p><p>Since one of the objectives of the project paradoxically is to build search engine software
that doesn’t require an insane monster of a server like this, this also makes sense, since
it keeps the indexes “PC sized” and might permit a cluster-based solution elsewhere.</p><p>There are other dev-ex benefits to keeping the working data sets small as well, it’s just less of
a pain to work with 100 GB files than 40 TB ones…</p><p>…</p><p>This is all written sort of mid-configuration. Nothing is quite final. A copy of the search engine
is up on the new server, but it’s all a bit of a construction space right now. It’s really great to
have two servers though, since the old one is still around, if I need some downtime, I can just re-direct
the DNS to the old IP.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>A jury this week awarded $228.5 million to seven plaintiffs in their case against Nevada-based water company Real Water, which sold alkaline water tainted with hydrazine, a highly toxic chemical found in fuel for rockets and spacecraft.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs included a 7-month-old boy who was hospitalized with severe liver failure and nearly needed a liver transplant. Another was a 69-year-old woman who was hospitalized for liver failure after drinking the water for years. She died in the hospital on November 11, 2020.
</p><p>They are among around a hundred people who say they have suffered acute liver toxicity and failure from the water and have filed lawsuits against Real Water, according to attorney Will Kemp. In an interview Friday, Kemp told Ars he represents a little over 60 of the plaintiffs, including the seven in the case that received a jury verdict this week. It was the first case to go to trial.</p>
<p>Jurors for the case in the 8th Judicial District Court in Clark County, Nevada, found Real Water liable for $200 million in punitive damages and $28.5 million in compensatory damages. Two other defendants, Hanna Instruments and Milwaukee Instruments, which were alleged to have made faulty water testing meters that contributed to Real Water's toxicity, were also found liable for compensatory damages but not punitive damages.</p>
<p>"We're hoping that the punitive award sends a message to people that they should test bottled water products before they put them on the market," Kemp told Ars.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The jury trial, which spanned mid-September to this week, also revealed how the water poisoned people: It contained hydrazine, which was likely to have formed during the company's untested water processing method, according to Kemp and an expert witness.</p>
<h2>Poisonous process</h2>
<p>The poisonings came to light in early 2021 when the local authorities in Nevada and the Food and Drug Administration announced that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/03/complaints-mount-after-5-kids-suffer-liver-failure-linked-to-alkaline-water/">at least five infants and children had suffered liver failure after drinking the water</a>. The findings led to a recall, but some of the company's products remained on the market. In May 2021, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Real Water Inc. on behalf of the FDA, alleging the company's officers, Brent Jones and his son, Blain Jones, were selling adulterated products made amid multiple manufacturing violations. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/at-least-25-poisoned-1-dead-from-real-alkalized-water-cdc-report-reveals/">As Ars previously reported</a>, the Joneses agreed to settle the case in June, and the DOJ bound them with a permanent injunction from ever preparing, processing, or selling water again.</p>
<p>A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in November 2021 laid out 25 cases of acute liver failure linked to the water—22 in Nevada and three in California, all of which occurred at the end of 2020. Specifically, the cases were linked to Real Water's 5-gallon Re<sup>2</sup>al Water product, sold in multiple southwestern states in places like Whole Foods.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<time datetime="2023-09-28">2023-09-28</time>
<p>To be precise, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE-754</a> floating point
subtraction is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_completeness">functionally
complete</a>. That means you
can construct any binary circuit using nothing but floating point subtraction.</p>
<p>To see how, we must start at the bottom. I quote the IEEE 754-2019 standard, section 6.3:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="6-3-the-sign-bit"><a href="#6-3-the-sign-bit" aria-label="Anchor link for: 6-3-the-sign-bit">6.3 The sign bit</a></h3>
<p>[…] When neither the inputs nor result are NaN, […]; the sign of a sum, or of a difference $x−y$
regarded as a sum $x+(−y)$, differs from at most one of the addends’ signs; […].
These rules shall apply even when operands or results are zero or infinite.</p>
<p>When the sum of two operands with opposite signs (or the difference of two operands with like
signs) is exactly zero, the sign of that sum (or difference) shall be $+0$ under all rounding-direction
attributes except <code>roundTowardNegative</code>; under that attribute, the sign of an exact zero sum (or
difference) shall be $−0$.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s dissect that.</p>
<ol>
<li>A subtraction $x - y$ is considered a sum $x + (-y)$.</li>
<li>Zero can have a sign, $-0$ and $0$ are distinct entities (although they compare
equal when testing with <code>==</code>).</li>
<li>If both of the addends have the same sign, the output must have that sign.
However, for $x - y$ that means if $x$ and $y$ have <em>different</em> signs the output
must have the sign of $x$.</li>
<li>If $x$ and $y$ have the same sign, and $x - y$ is zero, the output will be
$+0$ for all rounding modes except <code>roundTowardNegative</code>, then it will be $-0$.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now since the default rounding mode in virtually every context is <code>roundTiesToEven</code>,
we shall assume that from now on. However, everything works analogously even for
<code>roundTowardNegative</code>.</p>
<h2 id="a-truth-table"><a href="#a-truth-table" aria-label="Anchor link for: a-truth-table">A truth table</a></h2>
<p>So, what does that give us when subtracting zeroes?</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>-</span><span>0 </span><span>- -</span><span>0 </span><span>= +</span><span>0  </span><span># Same sign, must be +0.
</span><span>-</span><span>0 </span><span>- +</span><span>0 </span><span>= -</span><span>0  </span><span># Different signs, sign from first argument.
</span><span>+</span><span>0 </span><span>- -</span><span>0 </span><span>= +</span><span>0  </span><span># Different signs, sign from first argument.
</span><span>+</span><span>0 </span><span>- +</span><span>0 </span><span>= +</span><span>0  </span><span># Same sign, must be +0.
</span></code></pre>
<p>Interesting… What if we say that $-0$ is false and $+0$ is true?</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>A B | O
</span><span>----+--
</span><span>0 0 </span><span>| </span><span>1
</span><span>0 1 </span><span>| </span><span>0
</span><span>1 0 </span><span>| </span><span>1
</span><span>1 1 </span><span>| </span><span>1
</span></code></pre>
<p>Our resulting truth table is equivalent to ${A \vee \neg B}$, or ${B \to A}$ (also known as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMPLY_gate">IMPLY</a> gate, albeit with the arguments swapped). It turns
out this truth table is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_completeness">functionally
complete</a>, which means we can make arbitrary
circuits using only this gate.
Technically speaking, it is only functionally complete if given access to the
constant false. This is necessary to produce a NOT gate, and NOT + IMPLY is
a functionally complete set. I don’t know a better term for ‘functionally complete
if given access to some constant value’, however.</p>

<h2 id="subtraction-circuits"><a href="#subtraction-circuits" aria-label="Anchor link for: subtraction-circuits">Subtraction circuits</a></h2>
<p>Let’s build a demo in Python. First we’ll define our constants and allow us to print them nicely.
Note that even though they are distinct entities, $+0$ and $-0$ compare equal in IEEE 754 floating
point, so we must first extract the sign before comparing to 0 to distinguish.</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>import </span><span>math
</span><span>
</span><span>f_false = -</span><span>0.0
</span><span>f_true = </span><span>0.0
</span><span>f_repr = </span><span>lambda </span><span>x: </span><span>True </span><span>if </span><span>math.copysign(</span><span>1</span><span>, x) &gt; </span><span>0 </span><span>else </span><span>False
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can now make a NOT gate by using the fact that $-0 - x$ flips the sign of
zero $x$:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>f_not = </span><span>lambda </span><span>x: f_false - x
</span></code></pre>
<p>Let’s test that:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_not(f_false))
</span><span>True
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_not(f_true))
</span><span>False
</span></code></pre>
<p>Great! We can also build an OR gate by noticing that if we flip the sign of
the second argument before subtracting, we always get $+0$ (true) unless
both arguments are $-0$ (false):</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>f_or = </span><span>lambda </span><span>a, b: a - f_not(b)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Let’s test it out:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_or(f_false, f_false))
</span><span>False
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_or(f_true,  f_false))
</span><span>True
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_or(f_false, f_true))
</span><span>True
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_or(f_true, f_true))
</span><span>True
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now that we have OR and NOT, we can make all other gates, e.g.:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>f_and = </span><span>lambda </span><span>a, b: f_not(f_or(f_not(a), f_not(b)))
</span><span>f_xor = </span><span>lambda </span><span>a, b: f_or(f_and(f_not(a), b), f_and(a, f_not(b)))
</span></code></pre>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_and(f_false, f_false))
</span><span>False
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_and(f_true,  f_false))
</span><span>False
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_and(f_false, f_true))
</span><span>False
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_and(f_true, f_true))
</span><span>True
</span><span>
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_xor(f_false, f_false))
</span><span>False
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_xor(f_true,  f_false))
</span><span>True
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_xor(f_false, f_true))
</span><span>True
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; f_repr(f_xor(f_true, f_true))
</span><span>False
</span></code></pre>

<p>You may have heard of soft-float, software implementations of floating point
using integers. Let’s turn that on its head: an integer implementation done in

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>John Carmack, celebrated software engineer and founder of Keen Technologies, and <a href="https://www.amii.ca/about/our-people/richard-s-sutton/">Dr. Richard Sutton</a>, Chief Scientific Advisor at the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii) announce a partnership to bring greater focus and urgency to the creation of artificial general intelligence (AGI).</p><p>This partnership is the first public milestone for Keen Technologies, following its initial funding announcement in August of 2022. The initial $20M round was led by Nat Friedman, Danial Gross, Patrick Collision, Tobi Lutke, Jim Keller, Sequoia Capital, and Capital Factory. In December 2022, Carmack departed as consulting CTO at Meta to focus his efforts on AGI.</p><p>Sutton is the principal founder of the field of reinforcement learning. His work with Keen Technologies advances previously announced research priorities to understand basic computational intelligence. Through this work, documented in part in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11173">The Alberta Plan</a>, Sutton seeks to understand and create long-lived computation agents that interact with a vastly more complex world and come to predict and control their sensory input signals.</p></div><div><p>“Amii is proud to support our Chief Scientific Advisor and friend, Rich Sutton, in his partnership with Keen Technologies," said <a href="https://www.amii.ca/about/our-people/cam-linke/">Cam Linke</a>, CEO of Amii. "Rich is a deep, intentional researcher and pioneer in AI and has led the field for decades. Both Rich and John have each had enormous impacts on their respective fields and it is exciting to see two tech visionaries, who are optimistic about AI’s future, team up to move artificial intelligence forward.”</p><p>Carmack and Sutton are deeply focused on developing a genuine AI prototype by 2030, including establishing, advancing and documenting AGI signs of life.</p><p>Sutton will retain his current roles as Amii’s Chief Scientific Advisor, a Professor at the University of Alberta, Canada CIFAR AI Chair, and an Amii Fellow based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.</p><hr><p><b>About John Carmack</b></p><p>John Carmack defined the now ubiquitous “first-person shooter” gaming genre at Id Software with Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, and Quake, while pioneering the adoption of many computer graphic techniques, including binary space partitioning, light mapping, tangent space bump-mapping, and megatexturing. His early involvement with the creation of GPUs to accelerate 3D gaming has now come full circle with their use to accelerate AI.</p><p>At Armadillo Aerospace, he built reusable rocket ships, both autonomous and piloted, with a wide variety of propulsion and control systems.</p><p>In 2012, he ushered in the modern era of virtual reality with the Oculus Rift prototype, using GPU distortion compensation and TimeWarp temporal reprojection technologies to enable low-cost systems to outperform exotic professional ones. He went on to champion the development of mobile, all-in-one VR systems at Meta, leading to the current Meta Quest line.</p><p>In 2022, he founded Keen Technologies to work on the fundamental challenges of AGI.</p><p>For his technical work, John has been awarded two Emmys, a BAFTA fellowship, a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Game Developers Conference, and is in the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame.</p><p>Keen Technologies has a globally distributed team based in Dallas, TX, United States of America.</p><p><b>About Dr. Richard Sutton</b></p><p>Richard S. Sutton is one of the pioneers of reinforcement learning, a field in which he continues to lead the world. Over his career, he has made several significant contributions, including the theory of temporal-difference learning, the actor-critic (policy gradient) class of algorithms, the Dyna architecture (integrating learning, planning and reacting), the Horde architecture, and gradient and emphatic temporal-difference algorithms. He was the original founder of the Reinforcement Learning &amp; Artificial Intelligence Lab at the University of Alberta, and he is co-author of Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, the standard textbook on reinforcement learning, now in its second edition. Sutton has been named a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, the Royal Society of Canada, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, and the Canadian Artificial Intelligence Association (CAIAC), where he also received a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2018. His publications have been cited more than 130,000 times. He has been featured in popular publications such as Science, the Economist, the New York Times, the Wallstreet Journal, and Bloomberg’s Hello World.</p></div><div>

                <figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/image3-37.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="676"></figure><p>For years, we’ve <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/moving-from-recaptcha-to-hcaptcha/">written</a> that CAPTCHAs drive us crazy. Humans give up on CAPTCHA puzzles <a href="https://www.math.unipd.it/~gaggi/doc/ads20.pdf">approximately 15% of the time</a> and, maddeningly,<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/searles"> CAPTCHAs are significantly easier for bots</a> to solve than they are for humans. We’ve spent the past three and a half years working to build a better experience for humans that’s just as effective at stopping bots. As of this month, we’ve finished replacing every CAPTCHA issued by Cloudflare with<strong> </strong>Turnstile, our new CAPTCHA replacement (pictured below). Cloudflare will never issue another visual puzzle to anyone, for any reason.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/image2.gif" alt="" loading="lazy" width="878" height="300"></figure><p>Now that we’ve eliminated CAPTCHAs at Cloudflare, we want to make it easy for anyone to do the same, even if they don’t use other Cloudflare services. We’ve decoupled Turnstile from our platform so that any website operator on any platform can use it just by adding <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/turnstile-demo-workers/blob/main/src/explicit.html#L74-L85">a few lines of code</a>. We’re thrilled to announce that Turnstile is now generally available, and <strong>Turnstile’s ‘Managed’ mode is now completely free to everyone for unlimited use</strong>. </p><h3 id="easy-on-humans-hard-on-bots-private-for-everyone">Easy on humans, hard on bots, private for everyone</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/image6-5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1999" height="607"></figure><p>There’s a lot that goes into Turnstile’s simple checkbox to ensure that it’s easy for everyone, preserves user privacy, and does its job stopping bots. Part of making challenges better for everyone means that everyone gets the same great experience, no matter what browser you’re using. Because we do not employ a visual puzzle, users with low vision or blindness get the same easy to use challenge flow as everyone else. </p><p>It was particularly important for us to avoid falling back to audio CAPTCHAs to offer an experience accessible to everyone. Audio CAPTCHAs are often much worse than even visual CAPTCHAs for humans to solve, with only<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/burszstein_2010_captcha.pdf"> 31.2% of audio challenges</a> resulting in a three-person agreement on what the correct solution actually is. The prevalence of free speech-to-text services has made it easy for bots to solve audio CAPTCHAs as well, with <a href="https://uncaptcha.cs.umd.edu/papers/uncaptcha_woot17.pdf">a recent study</a> showing bots can accurately solve audio CAPTCHAs in over 85% of attempts. We’re proud to state that Turnstile is WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant, while eliminating the need for audio CAPTCHAs as well as visual ones.</p><p>We also created Turnstile to be privacy focused. Turnstile meets <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-is-eprivacy-directive/">ePrivacy Directive</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-is-the-gdpr/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-is-the-ccpa/">CCPA</a> compliance requirements, as well as the strict requirements of our own privacy commitments. In addition, Cloudflare's <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/FR2000863987">FedRAMP Moderate authorized package</a>, "Cloudflare for Government" now includes Turnstile. We don’t rely on tracking user data, like what other websites someone has visited, to determine if a user is a human or robot. Our business is protecting websites, not selling ads, so operators can deploy Turnstile knowing that their users’ data is safe.</p><p>With all of our emphasis on how <em>easy</em> it is to pass a Turnstile challenge, you would be right to ask how it can stop a bot. If a bot can find <a href="https://www.vox.com/22436832/captchas-getting-harder-ai-artificial-intelligence">all images with crosswalks</a> in grainy photos faster than we can, surely it can check a box as well. Bots definitely can check a box, and they can even<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01003"> mimic the erratic path of human mouse movement</a> while doing so. For Turnstile, the actual act of checking a box isn’t important, it’s the background data we’re analyzing while the box is checked that matters. We find and stop bots by running a series of in-browser tests, checking browser characteristics, native browser APIs, and asking the browser to pass lightweight tests (ex: proof-of-work tests, proof-of-space tests) to prove that it’s an actual browser. The current deployment of Turnstile checks billions of visitors every day, and we are able to identify browser abnormalities that bots exhibit while attempting to pass those tests.</p><p>For over one year, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/end-cloudflare-captcha/">we used our Managed Challenge</a> to rotate between CAPTCHAs and our own Turnstile challenge to compare our effectiveness. We found that <strong>even without asking users for any interactivity at all</strong>, Turnstile was just as effective as a CAPTCHA. Once we were sure that the results were effective at coping with the response from bot makers, we replaced the CAPTCHA challenge with our own checkbox solution. We present this extra test when we see potentially suspicious signals, and it helps us provide an even greater layer of security.</p><h3 id="turnstile-is-great-for-fighting-fraud">Turnstile is great for fighting fraud</h3><p>Like all sites that offer services for free, Cloudflare sees our fair share of automated account signups, which can include “new account fraud,” where bad actors automate the creation of many different accounts to abuse our platform. To help combat this abuse, we’ve rolled out Turnstile’s invisible mode to protect our own signup page. This month, we’ve blocked <strong>over</strong> <strong>1 million automated signup attempts </strong>using Turnstile, without a reported false positive or any change in our self-service billings that rely on this signup flow. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="lessons-from-the-turnstile-beta">Lessons from the Turnstile beta</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/image5-11.png" alt="" loading="lazy" title="Chart" width="1200" height="742"></figure><p>Over the past twelve months, we’ve been grateful to see how many people are eager to try, then rely on, and integrate Turnstile into their web applications. It’s been rewarding to see the developer community embrace Turnstile as well. We list some of the community created Turnstile integrations <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/community-resources/">here</a>, including integrations with WordPress, Angular, Vue, and a Cloudflare recommended <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@marsidev/react-turnstile">React library</a>. We’ve listened to customer feedback, and added support for <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/reference/supported-languages/">17 new languages</a>, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/client-side-rendering/">new callbacks</a>, and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/reference/client-side-errors/">new error codes</a>. </p><p>76,000+ users have signed up, but our biggest single test by far was the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-scaled-and-protected-eurovision-2023-voting/">Eurovision final vote</a>. Turnstile runs on challenge pages on over 25 million Cloudflare websites. Usually, that makes Cloudflare the far and away biggest Turnstile consumer, until the final Eurovision vote. During that one hour, challenge traffic from the Eurovision voting site outpaced the use of challenge pages on those 25 million sites combined! Turnstile handled the enormous spike in traffic without a hitch. </p><p>While a lot went well during the Turnstile beta, we also encountered some opportunities for us to learn. We were initially resistant to disclosing why a Turnstile challenge failed. After all, if bad actors know what we’re looking for, it becomes easier for bots to fool our challenges until we introduce new detections. However, during the Turnstile beta, we saw a few scenarios where legitimate users could not pass a challenge. These scenarios made it clear to us that we need to be transparent about why a challenge failed to help aid any individual who might modify their browser in a way that causes them to get caught by Turnstile. We now publish detailed client-side error codes to surface the reason why a challenge has failed. Two scenarios came up on several occasions that we didn’t expect: </p><p>First, we saw that desktop computers at least 10 years old frequently had expired motherboard batteries, and computers with bad motherboard batteries very often keep inaccurate time. This is because without the motherboard battery, a desktop computer’s clock will stop operating when the computer is off. Turnstile checks your computer’s system time to detect when a website operator has accidentally configured a challenge page to be cached, as caching a challenge page will cause it to become impassable. Unfortunately, this same check was unintentionally catching humans who just needed to update the time. When we see this issue, we now surface a clear error message to the end user to update their system time. We’d prefer to never have to surface an error in the first place, so we’re working to develop new ways to check for cached content that won’t impact real people. </p><p>Second, we find that a few privacy-focused users often ask their browsers to go beyond standard practices to preserve their anonymity. This includes changing their user-agent (something bots will do to evade detection as well), and preventing third-party scripts from executing entirely. Issues caused by this behavior can now be displayed clearly in a Turnstile widget, so those users can immediately understand the issue and make a conscientious choice about whether they want to allow their browser to pass a challenge.</p><p>Although we have some of the most sensitive, thoroughly built monitoring systems at Cloudflare, we did not catch either of these issues on our own. We needed to talk to users affected by the issue to help us understand what the problem was. Going forward, we want to make sure we always have that direct line of communication open. We’re rolling out a new feedback form in the Turnstile widget, to ensure any future corner cases are addressed quickly and with urgency.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-29-at-11.37.58.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1608" height="464"></figure><h3 id="turnstile-ga-and-free-for-everyone">Turnstile: GA and Free for Everyone </h3><p>Announcing Turnstile’s General Availability means that Turnstile is now completely production ready, available for free for unlimited use via our visible widget in Managed mode. Turnstile Enterprise includes SaaS platform support and a visible mode without the Cloudflare logo. Self-serve customers can expect a pay-as-you-go option for advanced features to be available in early 2024. Users can continue to access Turnstile’s advanced features below our 1 million siteverify request limit, as has been the case during the beta.

<p dir="auto">If you want to browse the source in an IDE, you might find the following useful.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The main game's source code is split across eight different ROM banks, which you can find in the <a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/nes-elite-beebasm/blob/main/1-source-files/main-sources">main-sources</a> folder. This is the motherlode and probably contains all the stuff you're interested in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">It's probably worth skimming through the <a href="https://www.bbcelite.com/about_site/terminology_used_in_this_commentary.html" rel="nofollow">notes on terminology and notations</a> on the accompanying website, as this explains a number of terms used in the commentary, without which it might be a bit tricky to follow at times (in particular, you should understand the terminology I use for multi-byte numbers).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The accompanying website contains <a href="https://www.bbcelite.com/deep_dives/" rel="nofollow">a number of "deep dive" articles</a>, each of which goes into an aspect of the game in detail. Routines that are explained further in these articles are tagged with the label <code>Deep dive:</code> and the relevant article name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">There are loads of routines and variables in Elite - literally hundreds. You can find them in the source files by searching for the following: <code>Type: Subroutine</code>, <code>Type: Variable</code>, <code>Type: Workspace</code> and <code>Type: Macro</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you know the name of a routine, you can find it by searching for <code>Name: &lt;name&gt;</code>, as in <code>Name: SCAN</code> (for the 3D scanner routine) or <code>Name: LL9</code> (for the ship-drawing routine).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The entry point for the main game code is the <code>BEGIN</code> routine in <a href="https://github.com/markmoxon/nes-elite-beebasm/blob/main/1-source-files/main-sources/elite-source-bank-7.asm">bank 7</a>, which you can find by searching for <code>Name: BEGIN</code>. If you want to follow the program flow all the way from the title screen around the main game loop, then you can find a number of <a href="https://www.bbcelite.com/deep_dives/" rel="nofollow">deep dives on program flow</a> on the accompanying website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The source code is designed to be read at an 80-column width and with a monospaced font, just like in the good old days.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">I hope you enjoy exploring the inner workings of NES Elite as much as I have.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-requirements" dir="auto"><a href="#requirements">Requirements</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">You will need the following to build Elite from the source:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">BeebAsm, which can be downloaded from the <a href="https://github.com/stardot/beebasm">BeebAsm repository</a>. Mac and Linux users will have to build their own executable with <code>make code</code>, while Windows users can just download the <code>beebasm.exe</code> file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Python. Both versions 2.7 and 3.x should work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Mac and Linux users may need to install <code>make</code> if it isn't already present (for Windows users, <code>make.exe</code> is included in this repository).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For details of how the build process works, see the <a href="https://www.bbcelite.com/about_site/building_elite.html" rel="nofollow">build documentation on bbcelite.com</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let's look at how to build Elite from the source.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-build-targets" dir="auto"><a href="#build-targets">Build targets</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">There are two main build targets available. They are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>build</code> - A version with a maxed-out commander</li>
<li><code>encrypt</code> - A version that exactly matches the released version of the game</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Unlike the Acornsoft versions of Elite on which it is based, the NES version is not encrypted, so there is no difference in encryption between the two targets. I have used the same target names for consistency, but the only difference is in the commander file.</p>
<p dir="auto">Builds are supported for both Windows and Mac/Linux systems. In all cases the build process is defined in the <code>Makefile</code> provided.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-windows" dir="auto"><a href="#windows">Windows</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">For Windows users, there is a batch file called <code>make.bat</code> to which you can pass one of the build targets above. Before this will work, you should edit the batch file and change the values of the <code>BEEBASM</code> and <code>PYTHON</code> variables to point to the locations of your <code>beebasm.exe</code> and <code>python.exe</code> executables. You also need to change directory to the repository folder (i.e. the same folder as <code>make.bat</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">All being well, doing one of the following:</p>


<p dir="auto">will produce a file called <code>elite-ntsc.NES</code> in the <code>5-compiled-game-discs</code> folder that contains the NTSC release, which you can then load into an emulator, or into a real NES using a flash cart.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-mac-and-linux" dir="auto"><a href="#mac-and-linux">Mac and Linux</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">The build process uses a standard GNU <code>Makefile</code>, so you just need to install <code>make</code> if your system doesn't already have it. If BeebAsm or Python are not on your path, then you can either fix this, or you can edit the <code>Makefile</code> and change the <code>BEEBASM</code> and <code>PYTHON</code> variables in the first two lines to point to their locations. You also need to change directory to the repository folder (i.e. the same folder as <code>Makefile</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">All being well, doing one of the following:</p>


<p dir="auto">will produce a file called <code>elite-ntsc.NES</code> in the <code>5-compiled-game-discs</code> folder that contains the NTSC release, which you can then load into an emulator, or into a real NES using a flash cart.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-verifying-the-output" dir="auto"><a href="#verifying-the-output">Verifying the output</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">The build process also supports a verification target that prints out checksums of all the generated files, along with the checksums of the files from the original sources.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can run this verification step on its own, or you can run it once a build has finished. To run it on its own, use the following command on Windows:</p>

<p dir="auto">or on Mac/Linux:</p>

<p dir="auto">To run a build and then verify the results, you can add two targets, like this on Windows:</p>

<p dir="auto">or this on Mac/Linux:</p>

<p dir="auto">The Python script <code>crc32.py</code> in the <code>2-build-files</code> folder does the actual verification, and shows the checksums and file sizes of both sets of files, alongside each other, and with a Match column that flags any discrepancies. If you are building an unencrypted set of files then there will be lots of differences, while the encrypted files should mostly match (see the Differences section below for more on this).</p>
<p dir="auto">The binaries in the <code>4-reference-binaries</code> folder are those extracted from the released version of the game, while those in the <code>3-assembled-output</code> folder are produced by the build process. For example, if you don't make any changes to the code and build the project with <code>make encrypt verify</code>, then this is the output of the verification process:</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-log-files" dir="auto"><a href="#log-files">Log files</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">During compilation, details of every step are output in nine files called <code>compile.txt</code> (for the header) or <code>compile0.txt</code> through <code>compile7.txt</code> (for banks 0 to 7) in the <code>3-assembled-output</code> folder. If you have problems, these might come in handy, and they're a great reference if you need to know the addresses of labels and variables for debugging (or just snooping around).</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The two versions count a different number of cycles in the NMI handler (7433 in the PAL version, 6797 in the NTSC version).</p>
</li>

<p dir="auto">The first title in the combat demo scroll text is different (the PAL title is "IMAGINEER PRESENTS --- E L I T E --- (C)BRABEN &amp; BELL 1991" while the NTSC title is "NTSC EMULATION --- E L I T E ---  (C)BELL &amp; BRABEN 1991")</p>

<p dir="auto">It's worth noting that the NTSC variant doesn't actually work on an NTSC machine. The NMI timings have been changed to work with some (but not all) emulators in NTSC mode, but it isn't a full NTSC conversion, it's an NTSC emulation (as per the scroll text).</p>

   <p>Champion bodybuilder. Hollywood superstar. Governor of California.</p>   <p>Not a bad resume.</p>   <p>Arnold Schwarzenegger has achieved more than most of us could ever hope to. And he's sharing some of his secrets to success in his new book <em>Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life</em>.</p>   <p><em>Morning Edition </em>host A Martinez spoke with Schwarzenegger about his latest project.</p>      <p><strong>A MARTINEZ</strong></p>   <p>When did becoming useful become something that you thought was important?</p>   <p><strong>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER</strong></p>   <p>Well, I think that ever since my father stressed when I was a kid to be useful. I think it had an impact on me, and it stayed with me as a method, so much so that I always wanted to perform and do more. It became such a big part of my life that even when I sleep in - sometimes past 6:00 in the morning - I feel guilty because I hear my father's voice saying, "Arnold, that's not how this country was built, by sleeping in. Be useful, do something. What are you doing today?" And so, you know, I think that it just stayed with me.</p>   
   <p><strong>A MARTINEZ</strong></p>   <p>But even at that young of an age, you understood what that meant. You understood a deeper meaning of what being useful meant.</p>   <p><strong>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER</strong></p>   <p>Well, let's assume for a second I didn't know what it meant. My father would make sure that I knew. Just to give you an example, I was studying bodybuilding at the age of 15, and my father would say, "Why are you lifting these dumbbells and barbells? Don't you think it would be better to just go out and chop some wood and shovel some coals for some poor people that don't have anyone?" It was common in those days: neighbor kids would go and do that kind of chore for older people so that when the fall comes, they have it for the winter.</p>   <p>I looked up to this famous boxer by the name of Laszlo Papp. He's a Hungarian boxer, European champion, and he trains by chopping wood. And so, "Why couldn't YOU chop wood? And then therefore, you would get muscles, you get strong, get great energy, you will look great. But at the same time, you're doing something useful. You're doing something for somebody rather than just for yourself and looking in the mirror." So he would make sure that you knew what being useful meant.</p>   
   <p><strong>A MARTINEZ</strong></p>   <p>Is being useful the same as not being useless?</p>   <p><strong>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER</strong></p>   <p>Well, it's more proactive. I mean, being useful is not just hanging back and making mistakes. It's going out and using your energy and your time for something good, which means for yourself but also and always to think about other people. I think that we have to be aware of the fact that we are creations by a lot of people. We are not self-made. I hate when someone says, "Oh, Schwarzenegger is the perfect example of a self-made man" because I'm not. I'm a creation of my parents. I'm a creation of my coaches, my teachers. I have been helped by my training partners, by my friends. Especially when I think about coming to America, it was Joe Wheeler that helped me to come over here, got me the airline ticket, helped me get the apartment and the car. The people of California voted for me to be governor of California. So I didn't become governor because I'm self-made; I became governor because people voted for me.</p>   <p><strong>A MARTINEZ</strong></p>   <p>But it was a compliment. I mean, I think people meant it as a compliment that you were able to motivate yourself to accomplish these things.</p>   <p><strong>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER</strong></p>   <p>Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it is a compliment, but it is very important to let people know: I really appreciate you saying that, but I'm a creation of all of this help.</p>   <p>I would not have done <em>Twins</em> if it wouldn't have been for Ivan Reitman. I would not have been able to do <em>Conan the Barbarian</em> if it wouldn't have been for John Milius. So there's so many people that helped me. And the reason why that is important, that we recognize that we are creations of people's help, is because that makes us then understand that we are responsible for going out and helping other people, that it is not a one-way street. You know, people help us to get to be where we are today, and therefore I now have the responsibility to go out and help other people to become successful.</p>   
   <p><strong>A MARTINEZ</strong></p>   <p>Well, just how wide of a scope, then, does being useful need to be? Because I can imagine for you, I think you probably have to feel useful to a lot [more] people than I would. I mean, if I feel useful to my grandkids or to my wife, I feel pretty good about the day.</p>   <p><strong>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER</strong></p>   <p>I think that it really depends on you how far you want to go with that. One thing we know for sure: the majority of people really don't feel like they're useful enough or they are successful enough. And this is what this book is all about: <em>Be Useful </em>is to give people the tools. How can they go and become more useful? How can they become more successful? How can they become happier with their lives, their jobs and everything that they are doing?</p>   <p>You have to understand that no matter what we do, there's someone there that can help you with that. If I want to go and learn how to ski, I take ski lessons. If I want to learn about bodybuilding, I'll go and get a fitness instructor. But there's really no one that provides usually the tools to success. I think what this book does is basically just say, look, here are some tools that I've used in my life. And the reason why I've become so successful in so many different areas is because I follow those rules and I applied those rules.</p>   <p><strong>A MARTINEZ</strong></p>   <p>So, for example, last year when you put out that video calling out Russia's misinformation campaign — and also telling Russia to stop the war in Ukraine — were you just expressing an opinion or were you trying to be useful?</p>

</div>   <p><strong>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER</strong></p>   <p>Both. Both to let the Russian soldiers and the Russian people know that this is an unjust war that is not provoked. There was no one there challenging Russia. This was a peaceful country, Ukraine, and they were minding their own business. All of a sudden, they're getting attacked. So that is not right. I think that we have to speak out because something's wrong, to help them to understand it — and at the same time to let people know around the world how I feel about it. It was just my opinion and also trying to be useful at the same time.</p>   
   <p>But, you know, this is not what this book is about. It's just really helping people to go to the next level when it comes to success. What I wanted to do is just let people know you don't have to have a job that you hate. If you take some time and create a vision for yourself and create a goal for yourself — and then chase that goal no matter how difficult it may be — life becomes kind of fun. Because to me, my life was always a lot of fun, even though I struggled a lot and I was battling it out, losing a lot of the battles and then winning some. It was always interesting and spicy and exciting because I knew what I was chasing all the time — to become Mr. Universe, or becoming the greatest bodybuilder in the world, or coming to America, or getting into movies and becoming a leading man, or running for governor. It doesn't matter what it is. It was always a fun chase.</p>   <p><strong>A MARTINEZ</strong></p>   <p>You mentioned losing some battles. Which battles did you lose? I think when people think of your life, they think that almost anything you've tried, you've been a success.</p>   <p><strong>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER</strong></p>   <p>Well, maybe it was successful in the end, but to get there... One of the things I talk about is to not be afraid of failure. Because you're going to fail. When I was 19 years old, I was competing in the Mr. Universe contest and I lost. I came second. It was no big drama because I was hoping to be in the top six, but I came second so it was terrific. When I came to America, I lost the Mr. Olympia competition against Sergio Oliva. I lost one of the Mr. Universe contests in America against Frank Zane. I remember I lost power-lifting championships, weightlifting championships. I had movies that went in the toilet. I had policy issues and referendums that went in front of the people that I lost. There was a lot of things.</p>   
   <p>And of course, in my personal life, you know, my marriage is a big loss and this is a big failure. So there's a lot of losses and failures that I've had in the past in my life. And I think that it is important that we recognize that. But no matter what it is, I always had an exciting life and always chased something, and that made the whole thing worth it.</p>   <p>So many people — young people especially — when you ask them what do you want to do in life, they look at you kind of like the deer in the headlights and just don't know what to say. To me, that is a big problem, because I always felt that I was enriched by the fact that I always knew where I was going.</p>   <p>And then there were some things that were unexpected, like running for governor. That was something that kind of unfolded only because there was a recall election in California.</p>   <p><strong>A MARTINEZ</strong></p>   <p>You had the opportunity.</p>   <p><strong>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER</strong></p>   <p>All of a sudden, I had this vision: me being governor. And so I chased that vision. Going from promoting <em>Terminator 3</em> and being this huge hit to all of a sudden going the other direction and saying, "I want to be a public servant." It was fun to chase that. I had this exact vision. I knew exactly what to say to the people and how to sell that idea, how to market myself, how to promote myself. I think this is the important thing: there's so many people that think small. They set a goal for themselves — a small goal because they're afraid to fail. And I tell people, don't be afraid to fail.</p>   <p><strong>A MARTINEZ</strong></p>   <p>Wait a second, YOU can have big goals. I think most people have to be happy with small goals in their lives. I don't think they can aspire to the things you can aspire to.</p>   
   <p><strong>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER</strong></p>   <p>No, because remember: when I was 15 years old, I was this ordinary Austrian boy, just like everyone else. I always had this dream that I want to be another Reg Park – a Mr. Universe who then did Hercules movies. So he became my idol. I wanted to win, like him, Mr. Universe several times and then be discovered in Hollywood. He was a fellow from England, from Leeds, from a factory town. I come from a factory down. Why could I not do that?</p>   <p>So I right away had a big vision to be like Reg Park (or to be Steve Reeves, an American version of Hercules). So, friends of mine wanted to be Mr. Austria; I right away thought of Mr. Universe, winning the world championship.</p>   <p>I remember when I was getting into movies, they said to me, maybe we can get you a job to play, maybe with your German accent, the Nazi officer. Or a bouncer or something like that. I mean, that's not what I wanted to do. I said I want to be a leading man. I right away shot for the big goal. And yes, it was riskier. It's very hard to climb the ladder. I said, forget about climbing the ladder — I'm going to create my own ladder and I'm going to climb that.</p>   <p>Now I'm going to show people how to do it.</p>   <p><strong>A MARTINEZ</strong></p>   <p>When it comes to having a clear vision, that's the first rule in your in your book, <em>Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life</em>. How do you get rid of the clutter to be able to have that clear vision? Because so much clutters up our lives.</p>   <p><strong>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER</strong></p>   <p>That's the key thing. You cannot go create a vision if your face is in the iPhone or iPad or the computer. That is not what creates a vision. That maybe makes you copy someone else, but it doesn't create a vision of something that you're really in touch with, that you feel like, I need to do this. I'm born to be this artist. I'm born to be a mechanic. I'm born to create my own garage and build muscle cars or whatever it may be. Everyone has something in them that makes them really want to go all out on something. You just need to apply those rules. Don't shoot for something small, shoot for something big. Don't be afraid of failure.</p>   
   <p>The key thing is: you work your ass off. One of the things that I know now being 76 years old: everything is directly related to work. The more you work your ass off, the further you're going to go. If you look for shortcuts, it's not going to happen. I've seen people in bodybuilding try to look for shortcuts. They never made it. I've seen it in acting. They have not made it. Everyone that was willing to work hard was able to make it and to become successful.</p>   <p>Selling yourself, selling your ideas, selling your vision is another very important part of this whole success formula. You have to convince people. You have to kind of communicate well. I mean, imagine when I was Governor of California and I said we have to reduce our greenhouse gases by 25% by the year 2020. Well, it was a great idea, but I now have to go and convince 40 million people in California that this is very important, that pollution kills people. We've got to have more renewable energy in California. We got to get rid of fossil fuels. We got to keep our nuclear reactors and nuclear power and blah, blah, blah, noise. And the people went along. The people went along because I sold the thing while I promoted it well, I marketed it well, I was communicating well. All of this is important in order to be successful.</p>   <p>The other one that I always tell people: let's do less talking and more listening. I have a chapter that says, shut your mouth and open your mind. It's very important because I think that if you always just talk, talk, talk, talk, you're not going to learn anything. The way you learn is if you just shut your mouth and listen to other people talk. Yes, you have to talk and yes, you have to communicate. But be aware that listening is really what makes you smart.</p>   
   <p>When I went into the capitol in Sacramento, I did a lot of listening because I had to learn very quickly about the various different policies, the various different issues. I mean, you go from one minute about prison guards' overtime, then you talk about the firefighters and talk about law enforcement. They talk about the nurses, the teachers. They talk about the crime. You're dealing with so many different subjects that from morning to night, it's better if you listen. Then if you sit down by yourself, without having the computers and the iPhone/iPads, that's how you get to be successful.</p>   <p><strong>A MARTINEZ</strong></p>   <p>The last tool in your book is called Break Your Mirrors. What does that mean, break your mirrors?</p>   <p><strong>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER</strong></p>   <p>This is a saying that comes from my father-in-law [Sargent Shriver]. My father-in-law gave a speech at Yale University, a commencement speech, and there he said to the students: Break that mirror that makes you always look at yourself. And you will be able to look beyond that mirror and you will see the millions and millions of people that need your help.</p>   <p>My father-in-law was one of my idols. He created the Job Corps and the Peace Corps, legal aid to the poor and all of these various different organizations. And he was always out there trying to find something to help the less fortunate. He was also the chairman of the Special Olympics, and his wife Eunice Kennedy Shriver created the Special Olympics. They always worked on helping the people that needed help. So to me, that saying said it all: we should not be consumed about ourselves. Yes, you have to deal with yourself. You have to build itself. But don't ever think that this is the only responsibility you have. You have the responsibility to break the mirror and to look beyond yourself and see the millions of people that need your help. And to go out and help, giving back to the community, giving back the city, to your state, your country is the ultimate that you have to do. And everyone has the ability to give back something. If you have no money, you can give your time to the kids — in reading or in English or to collect clothes so that homeless people can go to job interviews. There's so many simple things that we can do to help the community.</p>   
   <p>I got addicted to it because I started working with Special Olympics and helping Special Olympians, you know, train with weights and then go into powerlifting. It felt so good to be able to help kids that normally are not included, not getting equal rights. Then I started getting caught up with the President's Council of Physical Fitness for President Bush. [I] travelled through all 50 states to promote health and fitness and exercising in the schools. And it just one thing led to the next, and eventually I ran for governor.</p>   <p>It just feels so good to give something back. I think that this is without any doubt the greatest country in the world. And I always want to tell people that, you know, to me, giving something back was absolutely a necessity because of everything that I have ever achieved was because of America. And so to me, to give back to America is the greatest kind of honor and pleasure.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-testid="paragraph-0">Oct 6 (Reuters) - In a new front in the U.S.-China tech war, President Joe Biden's administration is facing pressure from some lawmakers to restrict American companies from working on a freely available chip technology widely used in China - a move that could upend how the global technology industry collaborates across borders.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-1">At issue is RISC-V, pronounced "risk five," an open-source technology that competes with costly proprietary technology from British semiconductor and software design company Arm Holdings <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/O9Ty.F" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">(O9Ty.F)</a>. RISC-V can be used as a key ingredient for anything from a smartphone chip to advanced processors for artificial intelligence.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">Some lawmakers - including two Republican House of Representatives committee chairmen, Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Mark Warner - are urging Biden's administration to take action regarding RISC-V, citing national security grounds.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-3">The lawmakers expressed concerns that Beijing is exploiting a culture of open collaboration among American companies to advance its own semiconductor industry, which could erode the current U.S. lead in the chip field and help China modernize its military. Their comments represent the first major effort to put constraints on work by U.S. companies on RISC-V.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">Representative Mike Gallagher, chairman of the House select committee on China, said in a statement to Reuters that the Commerce Department needs to "require any American person or company to receive an export license prior to engaging with PRC (People's Republic of China) entities on RISC-V technology."</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">Such calls to regulate RISC-V are the latest in the U.S.-China battle over chip technology that escalated last year with sweeping export restrictions that the Biden administration <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-warned-china-expect-updated-export-curbs-october-us-official-2023-10-02/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">has told China</a> it will update this month.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">"The CCP (Chinese Communist Party) is abusing RISC-V to get around U.S. dominance of the intellectual property needed to design chips. U.S. persons should not be supporting a PRC tech transfer strategy that serves to degrade U.S. export control laws," Representative Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement to Reuters.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">McCaul said he wants action from the Bureau of Industry and Security, the part of the Commerce Department that oversees export-control regulations, and would pursue legislation if that does not materialize.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">The bureau "is constantly reviewing the technology landscape and threat environment, and continually assessing how best to apply our export control policies to protect national security and safeguard core technologies," a Commerce Department spokesperson said in a statement.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">"Communist China is developing open-source chip architecture to dodge our sanctions and grow its chip industry," Rubio said in a statement to Reuters. "If we don't broaden our export controls to include this threat, China will one day surpass us as the global leader in chip design."</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">"I fear that our export-control laws are not equipped to deal with the challenge of open-source software - whether in advanced semiconductor designs like RISC-V or in the area of AI - and a dramatic paradigm shift is needed," Warner said in a statement to Reuters.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">RISC-V is overseen by a Swiss-based nonprofit foundation that coordinates efforts among for-profit companies to develop the technology.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">The RISC-V technology came from labs at the University of California, Berkeley, and later benefited from funding by the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Its creators have compared it to Ethernet, USB and even the internet, which are freely available and draw on contributions from around the world to make innovation faster and cheaper.</p><h2 data-testid="Heading">HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-13">Executives from China's Huawei Technologies have embraced RISC-V as a pillar of that nation's progress in developing its own chips. But the United States and its allies also have jumped on the technology, with chip giant Qualcomm <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/QCOM.O" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">(QCOM.O)</a> working with a group of European automotive firms on RISC-V chips and Alphabet's Google saying it will make Android, the world's most popular mobile operating system, work on RISC-V chips.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">Qualcomm declined to comment. Its executives said in August they believe RISC-V will speed up chip innovation and transform the tech industry.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">Google did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">If Biden's administration were to regulate U.S. companies' participation in the Swiss-based foundation in the manner lawmakers are seeking, the move could complicate how American and Chinese companies work together on open technical standards. It also could create hurdles for China's pursuit of chip self-sufficiency, as well as for U.S. and European efforts to create cheaper and more versatile chips.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-17">Jack Kang, vice president of business development at SiFive, a Santa Clara, California-based startup using RISC-V, said potential U.S. government restrictions on American companies regarding RISC-V would be a "tremendous tragedy."</p><p data-testid="paragraph-18">"It would be like banning us from working on the internet," Kang said. "It would be a huge mistake in terms of technology, leadership, innovation and companies and jobs that are being created."</p><p data-testid="paragraph-19">Regulating the open discussion of technologies is rarer than regulating physical products, but not impossible, said Kevin Wolf, an export-control attorney at law firm Akin Gump who served in the Commerce Department under former President Barack Obama. Existing rules on chip exports could help provide a legal framework for such a proposal, Wolf said.</p><p data-testid="Body">Reporting by Max A.

                    <p>The story of how one independent researcher conducted the largest-ever survey on fetishes, and what it has to teach us about sex, pleasure, and social science methodology.</p>
                <div>
                                            <div><p>At a conference recently, someone pulled me aside and told me they’d be down to offer me funding for my research. I was like, awesome, because for years people have been yelling at me for doing surveys on the internet.</p><p>If you’re new to my work, I’m a self-taught researcher, driven to learn through fortunate access to high sample sizes and sheer curiosity. As of this writing, over 700,000 people have responded to my <a href="https://www.guidedtrack.com/programs/u4m797m/run" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Kink Survey</a> on fetishes and sex — likely one of the largest surveys on the topic ever done. It grew out of my desire to answer two questions: <em>How weird is my own sexuality, exactly?</em> and <em>Why are there way more women interested in submission than men interested in dominance?</em></p><p>I originally started doing surveys via porn (I also do porn), which is a <em>super</em> easy way to get a lot of horny social media followers willing to do anything you ask them to. I’d ask them to help answer random questions I had, and quickly realized the data was terrible because my questions were terrible.</p><p>This started years of rapidly iterated survey learning. I’d pump out tons of questions, look at the resulting data on Google Sheets, and then rock back and forth with agony that I hadn’t thoroughly thought through how people might interpret question five and now all my correlations were useless. I’d often practice with questions in polls on X (formerly known as Twitter), which got lots of people in the comments reliably misinterpreting my phrasing in the most ingenious ways. I became a calloused, precise, question-asking machine. My phrasing could split any hair, and I started failing less and less frequently. Now, my crying-in-corner-agony per question rate is probably less than 1%.</p><p>It turns out that, when you get data, you have to figure out how to interpret it. Since I’m a homeschooler without a college degree, I started wrangling smart people to tell me how the hell a correlation worked, what p-hacking was, and how to do factor analysis. I’m a slow but thorough learner, and eventually got to the point where I was pretty solid with simple statistics.</p><p>But my datasets were getting huge, because my survey design was getting better at seducing people into taking them. My surveys, originally getting 10,000 responses, recently started to explode into the hundreds of thousands. You can’t process huge data in Google Sheets, so starting in 2021 I begrudgingly learned how to program in Python.</p><p>My audience expanded past just porn users into other, usually nerd-adjacent, platforms. Often my surveys would go viral elsewhere, bringing in novel audiences — recently, mostly young, female social media users, primarily on TikTok. I started buying randomized samples from the study recruiting site <a href="https://www.positly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Positly</a> to compare against my own, to try to understand the degree to which the respondents I drew from social media might be unrepresentative.</p><p>I’ve been saturated in the world of rationalists — an intellectual community formed around the group blog LessWrong — for eight years or so, and from watching them viciously tear apart other studies, I’d gained a sense of mistakes not to make: Don’t control for too many or too few things, do <em>not</em> trust your intuitions on how stats should work, don’t avoid reporting things that contradict your results, don’t check for new ways to investigate data just because it didn’t match your expectations, and report the null findings. I got odds-ratio-pilled and used those over p-values when I could; I published raw data; I shared my code; and I tried to keep my analysis and interpretation separate.</p></div>

                                            <div><p>Finally, I’d write up my findings and post them online. I’m not an expert — there’s a <em>ton</em> of stats stuff I don’t know — but I tried to keep it simple and just say what I found.</p><p>It turns out that a lot of people <em>really hate this. </em>People say I’m not trustworthy because I’m a sex worker and thus biased, because I don’t have a representative sample, because I don’t have credentials. My work isn’t peer reviewed, I haven’t weighted the data to ensure it’s representative, and I’m an “OnlyFans girl just polling her horny audience.”</p><p>So when the guy at the conference offered funding, I was excited to do <em>official, real work</em>. I’d dreamed that one day, if I had money, I’d do a formal, grown-up study, with verified participants. It’d be reliable and like the way professors do it and make all the angry internet people embarrassed for ever doubting me. I fantasized about repentant emails drizzling into my inbox. “You were right all along,” they would say. “The silly online correlations you found do in fact match the official serious business ones too! You’re a real scientist and we trust you."</p><p>But as I went about the rest of the conference, trying to plan how I would do my research respectably, it slowly dawned on me that … there actually wasn’t a clearly better option to recruit people to talk about kinks. Each potential study concept I worked through suffered from equal, if not greater, vulnerabilities than mine did.</p><p>For example, let’s say you want to study people who are really into vore, a fetish around swallowing someone whole or being swallowed whole, typically by a much larger creature. Maybe you want to find out if it correlates with things like childhood abuse or mental illness — common theories people have about the origin of fetishes. Let’s say you want around 300 people to check.</p><p>Firstly, how do you find these people? Vore, like most fetishes, is rare. If you wanted to do a survey where you randomly ask people about their childhood, and also if they’re into vore, you’d have to ask <em>thousands</em> to get the 300 people who mark “yes.” So how do you find your 300 body-swallowing enthusiasts? You probably need to look at some forums for vore lovers.</p><p>Already, we’re introducing a nonrandom sample — we’re picking from people <em>active on a vore forum.</em> Maybe these people are less ashamed about their fetish, maybe they’re lonelier in real life, maybe they’re much more into vore than the actual population of people into vore. These people are probably unusual in much more specific ways than the category of “people just browsing TikTok,” for example.</p><p>This issue plagues most existing sexual fetish research. Pedophilia is the most extreme example. In a society with such massive penalties for even suspected pedophiles, it’s obvious that any pedophile-heavy source you go to is going to be hugely affected by selection bias — e.g. sex offender registries. One <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11893991/" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> recruited pedophiles from an “outpatient facility for sexual offenders” and — shockingly — found that they had compulsive behaviors and anti-social personality traits.</p></div>
                                            <div><p>But back to our comparatively innocent vore enthusiasts. However we find them, we need to incentivize them to participate. You can pay participants in money or gift cards or, if you’re a professor, with grades. This might work. On paid survey-taking sites, you can try to improve the quality of your sample by looking at things like how fast it takes them to do the survey, are their answers consistent, do they have high quality ratings by previous researchers, etc., But you <em>can’t</em> filter by “Do they like vore?” — that’s not a default demographic that most services provide.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s say you have a survey that takes a half-hour, which means you might be paying $4 a survey. If you want 300 people who are into vore, and let’s say ~4% of the population likes vore, this means you’re going to need to pay roughly 7,500 people, which makes this a $30,000 study. And keep in mind you don’t know the vore prevalence beforehand, because this data isn’t available in traditional journals, because nobody has done a high-powered general fetish prevalence study before. Except me, which is why I know that number.</p><p>So let’s limit ourselves to confirmed vore fetishists. In that case, what’s to stop people from filling out the survey dishonestly in order to get the money? Maybe they wouldn’t, but “studies done on people trying to get $20” is a commonly mourned problem in research, and it seems reasonable that niche fetish enthusiasts are even <em>more</em> inclined to be dishonest than usual if they believe researchers are going to be scrutinizing the results.</p><p>And we want this to be a <em>real-life</em> survey anyway. To do this, we need to get our vore friends <em>into an office</em>, <em>verify their identity, and then have them fill out a survey in exchange for payment.</em></p><p>Uh, this is <em>terrible</em>. How could we possibly trust any results we get from this?&nbsp;</p><p>Problems like “How do you find a not-super-selected source, verify nontrolls are taking the survey, and get them to be honest?” exist in a lot of fields, but they’re <em>especially</em> difficult in sexual fetish research. The entire thing is studying rare traits that people are incentivized to lie about!</p><p>I recently looked at the the ratio between the frequency of fetishes in my sample and the degree to which people were aware of those fetishes in others. The least visible item I measured was BDSM. And <a href="https://aella.substack.com/p/fetish-tabooness-and-popularity-v3" rel="noopener noreferrer">the more uncommon the fetish, the more taboo</a>, and the greater the pressure against sharing it.</p><p>Genital response measuring is an option — but we’d <em>really</em> be selecting for people who are okay with an invasive measuring process, where your genitals are showing exactly how turned on you are by, e.g., an anime of a young boy screaming as he slides down the vast gullet of a half-lizard woman in a microkini. There are benefits to this — it might be good for checking correlations across lots of fetishes — but there’s no way this sample can be random.</p><p>So, given all this difficulty, it makes sense that most fetish research involves the scenario I described above — going to various fetish communities to ask them questions, usually in the form of visiting a forum or club dedicated to this fetish and posting a survey there. Consider the following sample of studies published between 1980 and 2020:</p><p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3813093" rel="noopener noreferrer">If the Shoe Fits: Exploring Male Homosexual Foot Fetishism</a> (262 respondents from an organization for foot fetishists)</p><p>To be clear, I still think these studies are respectable! I don’t mean to say a study is bunk just because the researchers behind it have limited access to populations - but the method seems ripe for accidental correlations.</p><p>Lots of existing research (maybe due to the necessity of using active community groups to get your sample) also focuses on action as opposed to fantasy, which conceivably biases the sample. A lot of things unrelated to a fetish probably affect whether someone acts on it. Are they in a liberal culture that celebrates their love of sitting on cakes? Are active cake sitters more disagreeable than those who wistfully dream about one day icing their own buttocks? Less afraid? Then we’d expect any studies done on cake sitting to find the cake-sitter community to be more liberal, disagreeable, and bold than the true population of people aroused by cake sitting.</p><p>Given all this difficulty, the ideal form here is probably an anonymous survey where people are properly incentivized to be honest — and what does this better than giving them information back about themselves? You need to give people a reason, and that reason should be as closely aligned with reporting the truth as you can make it. Telling people what you’ve found out about them based on that survey seemed like an obvious answer.</p><p>Basically: an elevated take on the classic BuzzFeed quiz, “What Princess Are You?” Of course this isn’t perfect — one can easily imagine someone deliberately putting in odd answers to see what this does to the results — but I think this still beats out other methods of research for most purposes.</p><p>Plus, it’s easy to disincentivize people spamming funny answers into your form for fun — just make your survey <em>really friggin’ long</em>.</p></div>
                                            <p><h2><strong>The Really Friggin’ Long Survey</strong></h2>
</p>
                                            <div><p>I’d gotten a year’s worth of funding from the wonderful <a href="https://invisible.college/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Invisible College</a> in 2021, and so I cracked my knuckles, quit OnlyFans, and settled down to work.</p><p>I wanted to make a survey about the origin of sexual fetishes because we know almost nothing about it, which is probably because this is really hard to do, for the reasons I’ve outlined above. Luckily I didn’t fully appreciate the difficulty when I started on this problem, or I might never have tried.</p><p>My goal was simple — I’d pick a fetish, ask if people were into it, and then ask them a bunch of questions about childhood. This would allow me to determine, for example, if you got spanked in childhood, did that correlate with interest in being spanked as an adult? This was pretty easy for a narrow fetish like this, but I wanted a big sample for the reasons I explained above — searching <em>specifically</em> for people interested in spanking seemed like it would do the whole “skewing results ’cause you’re drawing from the spank-specific community” thing, so I needed to get a bunch of people to answer for some other reason and then <em>happen to ask them</em> about spanking. This meant a really big sample.</p><p>And my access to big samples was limited. My audience — the most active of which was around 150,000 followers on X, though my total was around a million distributed across various platforms — would only take so many surveys, and I didn’t want to ask the same background questions over and over for each new fetish survey. It would be so much more efficient to combine <em>all</em> the fetishes into one big survey!</p><p>And while we were there, we should throw in more questions — what about porn use, sex rate, BMI, IQ, Big Five personality traits? You can check correlations for each additional question with everything else, so the more questions you add, the more valuable the data becomes. As my list of questions increased, the more compelling it became to add on yet another question, and this turned into a nightmare snowball.</p><p>In the end, I included 61 demographic, childhood, and other questions; 35 “general sex and porn” questions, and 206 fetish questions, for a total of 302 questions. But many of these were checkbox lists, where I asked people to “mark all that applied.” If you count those, the total amount of items I measured climbed to around 1,000.</p><p>I don’t know if you know how survey-taking norms work, but trying to get someone to answer 1,000 items is absolutely unhinged. It’s like asking someone to meet for coffee and then forcing them to stay for 12 hours of small talk. And the final cherry on the top of this sundae of horror was that the size of sample you need to make findings significant in the traditional sense increases with the number of questions you’re asking (or, more specifically, correlations you’re checking). So I needed a big sample size — many thousands, at least. But how do you get many thousands of people to sit down and answer a thousand questions?</p><p>It depends on the type of question, but on average I’ve found people take around two to six seconds to answer a survey question, which meant it would take roughly between 30 and 90 minutes to complete my survey.</p><p>I could pay people to take the survey, but that would get <em>really</em> expensive. If I were paying people $8 per hour to do this, and the survey <em>optimistically</em> took 30 minutes to do, then 10,000 responses would cost me $40,000.</p><p>I had to get creative.</p><p>First off was shortening the amount of time to take the survey, which sounds simple but was <em>agonizing.</em> I couldn’t let go of any of my precious questions. Each question I considered cutting meant I was releasing all of the other correlations I asked about into the wind. I felt like a hoarder on a TV show, wailing as I watched Marie Kondo slowly approach my front lawn.</p><p>But I <em>could</em> condense them. After lots of experimentation, building and testing out various survey versions, I settled upon a gated method. I’d ask people the first two categories — personal stuff and general sex stuff — like a normal survey, but the <em>fetish</em> part would be gated. I’d list a bunch of vaguely described fetish categories, like “Humiliation (defilement, impotence, cuckoldry, ridicule, etc.)” or “Transformations (growth/shrinking, bodyswapping, furries, etc.),” ask them to check off the ones they thought might apply, and then I’d feed them relevant questions from the categories that they checked.</p><p>But this meant I needed to define fetish categories, and there is <em>no</em> good research on this anywhere. I had to invent them. So I went and scraped the internet for all the fetish lists I could find, compiled them into a spreadsheet, and painstakingly tagged them all. There were nearly 900 fetishes, and I had to individually research most of them by wading into enthusiast boards in order to know how to tag them. I as a person really lack willpower (or discipline in general), and so here the only thing that kept me going was deliberately, frothily fantasizing about getting all the data in the end.</p><p>This still wasn’t ideal. My personal categorization of these fetishes was going to artificially cluster the data. If you clicked on, say, the “clothing” category, you would be exposed to more clothing-specific questions, which might make you more likely to mark “yes” to things you’re only mildly interested in, while someone who didn’t click that category wouldn’t see those questions at all.</p><p>And I wasn’t that confident in my fetish clustering. What if I put “cake sitting” into the “humiliation” category instead of the “sensory” one, but it turned out cake sitters didn’t care at all about humiliation? Despite my rigorous research, there’s no way I was going to have a 0% error rate.</p><p>To help compensate for this, I picked a few of the gated fetish questions and repeated them outside the gate, so I could compare the answers between the whole survey population and people who expressed an interest in a specific cluster to see just how much my survey design was affecting responses. This still wasn’t perfect, though!</p><p>The ideal question format was a Likert scale — “I find light bondage to be:” on a “not erotic” to “extremely erotic” zero-to-five scale. With this information, I could help differentiate between responses like “meh I guess” and “this is essential to my sexual function.” But scales take a while to complete, and so this ended up as a sacrifice on the altar of time sensitivity. I reserved&nbsp;Likert scale questions for <em>general categories</em>, like “clothes,” and then condensed many of the subcategories into increasingly nested checkboxes. I get to see <em>how much</em> you like the general category, and then binary responses to items within that category. If you like clothes, does that mean specific clothing textures, states, or items? If textures, is it latex? Leather?</p></div>
                                            <div><p>The entire process was a series of tiny, painstaking tradeoffs. Each time I decided to make a question into a scale, this boosted the total time it took to complete the survey by a few seconds. And I <em>had to care</em> about those few seconds.</p><p>In the end, the average time it took users to complete the survey was 40 minutes. This is <em>really</em> long for a survey! You really have to get people to care about it in order to finish.</p><p>So: How do I get them to care?</p><p>I decided to give users a score at the end — <em>How freaky are you compared to others?</em>&nbsp;</p><p>This turned into watery-eyed frustration all on its own, because how do you measure freakiness? Sure, you could do a survey to get people to rate how taboo various sexual things were — and this is precisely what I did — but this still leaves the problem of weighting. Necrophilia is really freaky, sure, but what if someone is only <em>slightly</em> into it? Is that freakier than someone who’s <em>extremely</em> into voyeurism? And then there’s the fact that freakiness is also a function of gender norms. If you’re a really submissive man, that’s certainly culturally freakier than being a dominant man, so I had to calculate different scores independently for men and women.</p><p>Scoring the survey took almost as much time as actually building it did.</p><p>The last part was easy. I assembled a list of fictional and well-known characters — like SpongeBob, Hitler, and Bambi — and asked people to rank them on how taboo they assumed their sexuality was. I then matched them up, based on these rankings, to the scores that people got in the Big Kink Survey. I personally got House, from that TV show some years back, or roughly 85th-percentile kinky. The character that people assigned the highest kinkiness score was Willy Wonka.</p><p>As of my writing this, the survey has around 550,000-700,000 respondents, depending on how aggressively I’m cleaning the data. Most respondents are in their early 20s, and around 70% of respondents are women — a reflection of the demographics that most love taking internet surveys (as verified by my friend who runs one of the oldest, biggest personality-testing websites on the internet).</p><p>One great thing about my sample is that I asked about hundreds of niche fetishes without having to go into a single niche-specific community and ask its members to take my survey. The survey results for the fetishes I’m asking about are as close to an unbiased sample as we can reasonably get given you’re trying to get a big sample with low cost.</p><p>I think <em>information about your personality</em> is one of the best possible incentives to complete a survey. Yes, your answers are probably warped a bit by your self-perception, but at least it’s an incentive directly related to <em>you</em>, as opposed to trying to get paid.</p><p>And the length of the survey probably indirectly helped accuracy here too — when I was younger and took personality tests for fun, I would retake them to see what changing little answers did to my score — but this is really annoying to do if the survey is 40 minutes long! This also made it resilient to intentional brigading or trolling — it’s simply difficult to sink that much time into warping the results, especially to the degree where it would show up on my final analyses, and especially with enough cleverness to get around all the survey checks I included to catch unserious responses. And when looking at survey results, I only include data from people who’d completed a majority of the survey.</p><p>The data I’ve gathered so far seems to match up quite well with existing data, at least for well-studied variables. For instance, my height and weight numbers correlate at around the standard 0.5, the rate of pedophilia in men is 3%, and the gap in interest between women and men in BDSM is clearly represented.</p><p>I don’t know why academia hasn’t tried to come up with more innovative solutions for gathering large amounts of survey data. Researchers are already doing internet surveys, so why not sink some effort into marketing? Hire some influencers? Get on podcasts? I don’t know. I treat my surveys not only as a vehicle to gather data, but also as products in themselves — to sell your survey, you have to make respondents enjoy it. You have to make them <em>like</em> giving you their time. It seems like current academia — or at least the sex part — views taking surveys as something like a chore, or like school. I’m not sure they’ve thought about making it fun.</p><p>I don’t mean sacrifice the quality of the survey itself. I was painstakingly dry with the wording of the questions, because I <em>didn’t</em> want a cheeky tone to prime respondents to give cheeky answers — but results at the end are a clean way to make it fun. I didn’t <em>have</em> to tell people they were the sexual equivalent of SpongeBob or whatever at the end of this survey, but I did — and this caused them to share it with friends and on TikTok.</p><p>I come from a background of marketing sex work, where I had to claw my way up the internet flesh by sheer “how do I make people want to send this thing to their friends.” And this is the eye with which I’m approaching research. I have done most of this without funding, yet have gotten samples that, if you paid test takers to do, would cost upwards of $4 million.</p><p>I also make my research a community effort — not only do I share my raw data and code, I regularly crowdsource questions from the public about what to study next. What hypotheses do people have that they want tested? I do drafts of survey questions in X polls, to see how commenters will inevitably misinterpret my wording and thus inform me on how to write the question more clearly in the future. I hope this process helps vanquish the sacredness of research.</p><p>And more specifically, I hope it normalizes people with fetishes. I feel such care and compassion for people walking around with these strange arousal patterns in their head that often cause such alienation. They’re shunned or ignored socially, but also by researchers — because of the logistical difficulty, because institutional review boards make approval hard, because sexuality is a subject rife with potential triggers, or because people simply don’t want to investigate things that aren’t trendy or socially sympathetic. I’ve got half a million data points, with an individual behind each one, and I’ll keep trying to understand all of them. &nbsp;</p></div>

			<h3>A dispatch from the wild, vicious world of consumer payments</h3>
<hr>
<p>On the day I chose to start writing this, I went to an afternoon showing of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldboy_(2003_film)">Oldboy</a> at Alamo. There’s a quote that’s repeated at least three times:</p>
<blockquote><p>Laugh, and the world laughs with you;<br>
Weep, and you weep alone;</p></blockquote>
<p>I’d been trying to write a pithy summary of my last four years in consumer payments, and here it was, served up on a giant screen. Luck is critical for startups, even in death.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@braidapp/sharing-money-shouldnt-be-hard-introducing-braid-e86d0ffdc52a">Braid</a> was a consumer payments company that was around from 2019-2023. We designed and shipped a brand-new multi-user financial account called a money pool, and raised ~$10mm in venture capital from investors that I’d looked up to for years. It took us ~2.5 years to find product-market fit, and after that we grew sustainably and quickly. We’d made software that people seemed to want.</p>
<p>A few months later, we were dead.</p>
<p>The thrash happened fast, and left a sea of heartbroken customers, employees, investors, and partners. The thing that broke us wasn’t a stronger blow than any of the others, it was simply the last one we could tolerate. The company shut down in September 2023.</p>
<p>That’s not the end of it, though. We ran an auction for our IP and there was a single bidder: me. You see, fintech is far from over.</p>
<p>Tolstoy was right: <em>successful companies are all alike; every failed company fails in its own way.</em> Failure is a cocktail of loneliness, grief and shame, which is why these stories are not told often. But every failure is also a playbook for the next obvious, effortless success, so it’s critical to share.</p>
<p>I hope our story is helpful.</p>
<p><a href="https://amandapeyton.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_08901.jpg"><img title="Harrison Street" src="https://amandapeyton.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_08901-825x1024.jpg" alt="" width="495" height="614"></a><small>Braid’s empty office on Harrison St. in SF</small></p>
<p><strong>What’s Below</strong><br>
I’ve included a timeline of the company’s life, along with one lesson/myth from that time period.</p>
<p><strong>1. Road to Product-Market Fit</strong>, 2019, 2020 and most of 2021.<br>
<em> Myth: Your Early Adopters Are Your Best Customers</em></p>
<p><strong>2. Then, It Worked</strong>, Late 2021 to Summer 2022.<br>
<em>Myth: With Great Metrics You Can Always Raise</em></p>
<p><strong>3. The Ice Bath,</strong> Summer 2022.<br>
<em>Myth: Ruthless Dedication to Compliance Will Save You </em></p>
<p><strong>4. We’re So Done, We’re So Back, We’re So Done</strong>, Summer 2022 to Spring 2023. <em><br>
Myth: The Answer is AWS for Fintech</em></p>
<p><strong>5. Shutting Down, </strong>Summer 2023.<strong> </strong><br>
<em> Myth:Failure is a Learning Experience for Everyone</em></p>
<p>This post is for those who still dare to dream and build in fintech. We do not do this work because it is easy. We do not spend our days trying to make origami out of tissue paper to simply quit and go home. Consumers deserve a financial system that is no less than excellent, and someone needs to do the work to make that happen.</p>
<p>I still blame myself wholly and completely for Braid’s demise, but this post isn’t about me. It’s about what happened.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Road to Product-Market Fit, </strong>2019-2021<br>
<em>Myth: Your Early Adopters Are Your Best Customers</em></p>
<p>We had an initial concept for the money pool right away, though it had many different names over time. A multi-user bank account was painful to build and difficult to operationalize for a bunch of reasons, which meant we had very few competitors. But for most of these years our metrics were flat. With consumer products it either works or it doesn’t. We iterated constantly for ~2.5 years.</p>
<p><a href="https://amandapeyton.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-03-at-11.50.34-AM1.png"><img title="Multiplayer Wisdom" src="https://amandapeyton.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-03-at-11.50.34-AM1-1024x541.png" alt="" width="600" height="300"></a></p>
<p>But there’s nothing like a hot market. In early 2019, the <a href="https://www.revolut.com/news/revolut_reports_continued_rapid_growth_in_2019_after_350_increase_in_revenues_for_2018/">neobanks</a> were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/banking-startup-n26-raises-another-170-million-at-3-5-billion-valuation/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACfMfxnnaMdvHSOMRA71QTMjcNdGYOh4ymHj92t9cE3PFWVWEnasRdu4laaDH2IaNfkt5MafKV0RZ7Y8S-skUVce5A-kPNWNh6XxT4Ll2ciaj9LcEBX2gvdQAmxl3KaU6xpWps7cVlAUjdk4xrDiDXwoelTeEhbc2WcDnw445uqt">taking over</a> <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2019/transferwise-reports-66-pct-profit-growth-yoy/">Europe</a>, and in the U.S. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-19/stripe-becomes-third-most-valuable-startup-in-the-u-s">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/18/coinbase-generated-520-million-in-revenue-last-year-reuters-estimates/">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/22/robinhood-lands-a-7point6-billion-valuation-after-recent-funding-round.html">Robinhood</a>, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2019/11/18/digital-bank-chime-will-quadruple-its-revenue-in-2019-reeling-in-direct-deposits/?sh=71788d3a6487">Chime</a> were ripping.</p>
<p>We heard “yes” a lot in those years.</p>
<p>We built the software that we’d wanted to use ourselves, and eventually others started to use it and love it, too. We rode the roller-coaster all the way up, and got high enough to kiss the clouds. But this took a long time.</p>
<p>There are two types of product-market fit for a fintech company: fake PMF and real PMF. Many fintechs, including us, dupe themselves into thinking their PMF is real when it’s not. All the signs are there: enviable early traction, organic growth, and real payment volume. It’s easy to look at the numbers and say, wow, there’s such demand for what we’ve built. We’ve found our cohort of wildly passionate early adopters.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these people are criminals. They were there to steal our money. They’re early adopters because they’re fraud sharks patrolling coastal waters for fresh meat. And our little payments app? Well, you can guess.</p>
<p>You know who doesn’t move $500 into a brand-new app they’ve never heard of, within 10 minutes of signing up? Real consumers. They need time to learn about the product, build up trust, move $1 or $10 in and out, and make sure everything works.</p>
<p>For the first few months, or few years, fraud can feel all-consuming because it is. I’m thankful that there are many great companies working on this problem (<a href="https://www.sardine.ai/">Sardine</a>, <a href="https://www.sentilink.com/">Sentilink</a>, <a href="https://www.alloy.com/">Alloy</a>, <a href="https://www.unit21.ai/">Unit21</a>, <a href="https://www.socure.com/">Socure</a>, and more). But in the beginning, it was crushing and time-consuming to handle.</p>
<p>The bright side is there are a lot more real consumers than there are fraudsters. If a product resonates, eventually it all flips. I drew the following graph the day we figured this out, and it’s still up on my wall.</p>
<p><a href="https://amandapeyton.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_3570.jpg"><img title="IMG_3570" src="https://amandapeyton.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_3570-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Then, It Worked</strong><br>
<em>October 2021-July 2022</em><br>
<em>Myth: With Great Metrics You Can Always Raise</em></p>
<p>When we finally found our groove, our payment volume grew ~5% a week, most weeks, for nearly 22 straight weeks in H1 2022. We went from processing less than $10K a day to having multiple $100K+ days, in the span of around five months. We were on track to pass $10mm in monthly volume by Q4 2022. We’d figured out who our customer was, why people wanted what we’d built, and how to find more of them for very little money.</p>
<p>We’d get asked a lot about use-cases – who was using it, and for what?</p>
<p>The most concise explanation of the multi-user opportunity was this: there are financial accounts for 1 and 2 consumers, and there are financial accounts for businesses. But there is no financial account for <em>n</em> consumers. Joint accounts are insufficient, outdated, often (but not always) capped at two, and not a product priority for most banks. A money pool could serve a customer base for which there was no existing product, only clunky workarounds.</p>
<p>There were myriad buckets of <em>n </em>users who loved having a financial account designed just for them. A few examples from our own data: coparents, houses, art collectives, extended families who get along, teams, people who share livestock, churches, punk bands, weekend hustles, extended families who don’t get along, wiccans, and our team’s personal favorite, firehouses.</p>
<p>The use-cases that didn’t work well for us were short-duration social events: group travel, bachelor parties, etc. The <em>“split payments with friends”</em> meme, we found, was a red herring and a fallacy. Opening a standalone financial account for a one-off event makes no sense. These use-cases had massive churn, low relative volume and created little sustainable long-term value. Use Venmo!</p>
<p>Instead of the usual hockey stick graph, here’s a video of a fireman from Alabama talking about how they used Braid:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8qIWe3M1Rng?si=XrOBFJzFKSdNbWzi" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I called one of our investors in early October 2021 to report that we’d figured it out, that it was going to work. He said, <em>“great, raise money immediately, the time is now.” </em>This advice was excellent, prescient, and correct.</p>
<p>I fought him. I said, <em>“if our numbers are great and consistent, we can always raise, let’s wait it out a few more months.”</em> I believed this, too. But this was the moment I got greedy. I’d like to blame it on anything else – companies raising huge rounds off zero traction, ZIRP, whatever. I’d been building software since I was in my early 20s, and felt that, finally, the rest of the world now understood the magic of software business models. <em>Of course these multiples are warranted</em>, I thought to myself – this growth has no ceiling, the TAM is “unlimited” and this is our new reality. The revenge of the nerds is happening in real-time, and gosh,<em> it fucking rules.</em></p>
<p>But if I really take a hard look at that moment, it was about me, and my ego. We’d processed eight-figures of payments at that point, and over the next few months, we grew consistently and fast. But venture capital is not for companies that are good, or even companies that are great. It’s for companies that are so excellent that they produce outsized returns at the right time, in the right market. We timed this completely wrong and it hurt us.</p>
<p>Every dollar a startup can raise is a gift. For a time I lost sight of this, and I won’t make that mistake again.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Ice Bath</strong><br>
<em>July 2022<br>
Myth: Ruthless Dedication to Compliance Will Save You</em></p>
<p>We’d finally found a delicate equilibrium balancing the many mouths we had to feed: consumers, banks, networks, regulators, employees, investors, vendors and fraudsters.</p>
<p>But that balance got ripped apart fast. Our sponsor bank’s behavior changed suddenly. They stopped replying to emails and became noticeably cagey on phone calls. When they did reply, it was usually with an urgent demand for something they hadn’t asked us about in years. We’ve never heard the full story, but this bank isn’t in the fintech sponsorship business anymore, with us or with anyone. Eventually, we had to move to a new bank. We had to offboard and cash-out all our customers in the summer of 2022.</p>
<p>It felt like a bucket of ice got dumped over our heads. Here is a highly realistic AI-generated image of me in that moment:</p>
<p><a href="https://amandapeyton.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_3898.jpg"><img title="IMG_3898" src="https://amandapeyton.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_3898.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500"></a></p>
<p>In fintech, it’s easy to pit the technologists and the regulators against one another: <em>fuck around</em> on one side, <em>find out</em> on the other. But we knew better than that. Our product was not in any sort of legal gray area (e.g. crypto) and fit within the bounds of existing law. From the day we started until the day we shut down, we’d spend millions of dollars to build a best-in-class compliance program to sit alongside our offering. For every hour that we spent on engineering for a consumer-facing feature, we spent another hour on compliance, and a third hour on fraud. That meant everything took 3X as long, but there wasn’t another way.</p>
<p>What we didn’t understand at any level of depth, is that even the most robust compliance program would only get us so far. We were taking on indirect risk from every fintech in the bank’s portfolio, as well as the bank’s relationship with its regulators, which is highly protected and confidential. Fintechs sit adjacent to regulators, not directly under them, so mission-critical information affecting multi-million-dollar companies is often delivered via backchannel whispers and a messy game of telephone.</p>
<p>Yet, one observation about sponsor banks is how much they care about supporting new products. The community-oriented mindset is pervasive among bankers. Many see their bank as a place to help their community members live the lives they want. I continue to go back to this quote from a Credit Union executive <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/creditunions/news/sketching-out-the-future-for-a-bigger-better-credit-union-movement">from February 2018</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People don’t want a mortgage, they want a house…They don’t want an auto loan, they want a car to get to work. They don’t want a savings account, they want a way to buy the things they want.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is encouraging, but banks do not answer to their fintech customers, they answer to their regulators. If the regulators come down on the bank, as the fintech there’s nothing you can do about it. A regulatory rug pull can and will outstrip any early traction or compliance gold stars that you think might save you.</p>
<p>Put another way, as a startup we were a tiny rivulet downstream of the ocean that is the U.S. financial system. When the dam broke, we learned very quickly that no one cared about our perfect, squeaky clean BSA audit.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>We’re So Done, We’re So Back, We’re So Done</strong><br>
<em>July 2022 – April 2023<br>
Myth: The Answer is AWS for Fintech</em></p>
<p>The company was effectively in a coma from July 2022 to January 2023. It was bleak – we were a payments company processing $0 in payment volume. Eventually, we found a new bank that wanted to work with us, and we were eager to get the product back online. We worked for ~six months on the migration, and Braid came roaring back to life in January 2023.</p>
<p>We started from zero and processed over $1mm in the first ~30 days of our relaunch. It felt like we’d get back to where we left off quickly, as if no time had passed. In the spring of 2023, we signed a term sheet for a new round of funding. It looked like we might make it through, after all.</p>
<p>The euphoria didn’t last.</p>
<p>Six weeks after our relaunch, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/global-markets-banks-wrapup-1-2023-03-10/">SVB imploded</a>, and right after, <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/block/">Hindenburg Research’s Cash App report</a> dropped. The market kept getting worse. Rates kept going up.</p>
<p>The nail in the coffin came soon after. A critical third-party informed us that they’d changed their mind on a key technical decision. All the players in our ecosystem had not fit together perfectly post-migration, and we’d been dealing with a long list of technical problems.This change was going to break all our software. We had two decisions: rebuild over from zero or shut it all down. It didn’t feel right to take additional capital knowing that we’d have to rebuild, again, so we called off the round.</p>
<p>This should be a separate post, but I wanted to note how much my feelings about fintech software changed over my four-plus years at Braid. Initially, we thought leveraging third-party software would help us move faster and focus on our core offering.</p>
<p>What we found, instead, was every additional partner had the potential to break big, important parts of our stack. Building a multiplayer offering meant we had to be as close to the metal as possible, because a lot of our UX didn’t really exist off-the-shelf. After several painful migrations, our distaste for contractual and technical lock-in grew dramatically. By the end, if there was something we could build ourselves in Retool, we did.</p>
<p>In addition, building mostly in-house was the only way our unit economics worked. There’s a lot of great fintech software out there, but if that software eats your entire margin, you’ll end up dead regardless.</p>
<p>Once we decided it was over, I spent the morning sitting in my Herman Miller chair that would soon be sold, zooming from one end of the office to the other. Could I put it off, just one more hour? The dread and loneliness in that moment is hard to overstate – sending out a final email to customers, laying people off, selling everything, telling the investors.</p>
<p>I’ve been lucky to have started four software companies. Every time they end, whether it’s “a good outcome” or “a bad outcome”, it’s universally devastating.</p>
<p>Finally, we told everyone it was over, and cashed-out our customers for the second time.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Shutting Down, IP Sale</strong><br>
<em>June-September 2023<br>
Myth: Failure is a Learning Experience for Everyone</em></p>
<p>The team was gone by June, and I spent the summer winding everything down. The first note I wrote down after we shut down was: <em>when you win, you win together, and when you fail you fail alone.</em> Our failure felt like a lesson, a “case study”, for everyone but me. For me, it was a punch in the gut. In my experience, the best quote on failure is from <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/parker-conrad-takes-the-pain">Parker Conrad</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Failure is really, really, really awful,’ he told me. ‘People describe it as, ‘Oh, you learn so much from failure.’ I don’t think that’s true. I think the only thing I learned was how much failure sucks and how soul destroying it is.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was important to write up these lessons for everyone else. But for me, the biggest takeaway was that I never, ever wanted to fail again.</p>
<p>Braid shut down almost exactly three years after we wrote the <a href="https://medium.com/@braidapp/on-multiplayer-fintech-cb4fffbfe455">Multiplayer Fintech</a> essay. To this day I still believe everything written there – the soul of the product didn’t change much over all the years we worked on it. We swapped features, changed banks, processed thousands, then millions, then tens of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>We ran an auction for the IP, and in the end, there was only one bid: from me. This happens more often than people realize. Payments software has enormous overhead (compliance, fraud, regulatory, etc.) so the software on its own has little inherent value. All our major investors approved the sale, and I’m extremely thankful and grateful they did. Braid’s second act is currently <a href="https://braid.substack.com/">a Substack email list </a>(sign up!), a Github repo and a blinking cursor in a brand-new Google Doc.</p>
<p>Will it be different next time? Yes. Absolutely. So much has changed about the product, market conditions, and business model over the years. Every startup is an amalgamation of thousands of data points that are changing in real-time, and no two are the exact same. The through line is making something people want. This is the most sacred thing of all, and one thing that will never be a myth.</p>
<p>Braid’s second act will be just as tumultuous, I’m sure. Consumer financial needs change faster than our financial system can evolve to meet them. This is a fact. There’s an enormous opportunity here to build excellent software that solves a tangible problem, and that’s what makes it worth it to keep going.</p>
<p>And, I hate to lose.</p>

<p><strong>Solitude</strong><br>
<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45937/solitude-56d225aad9924">By Ella Wheeler Wilcox</a></p>
<p>Laugh, and the world laughs with you;<br>
Weep, and you weep alone;<br>
For the sad old earth must borrow its mirth,<br>
But has trouble enough of its own.<br>
Sing, and the hills will answer;<br>
Sigh, it is lost on the air;<br>
The echoes bound to a joyful sound,<br>
But shrink from voicing care.</p>
<p>Rejoice, and men will seek you;<br>
Grieve, and they turn and go;<br>
They want full measure of all your pleasure,<br>
But they do not need your woe.<br>
Be glad, and your friends are many;<br>
Be sad, and you lose them all,—<br>
There are none to decline your nectared wine,<br>
But alone you must drink life’s gall.</p>
<p>Feast, and your halls are crowded;<br>
Fast, and the world goes by.<br>
Succeed and give, and it helps you live,<br>
But no man can help you die.<br>
There is room in the halls of pleasure<br>
For a large and lordly train,<br>
But one by one we must all file on<br>
Through the narrow aisles of pain.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="tps_slideContainer_35233">
<p><strong>Tens of thousands of Android devices have been shipped to end-users with backdoored firmware, according to a warning from cybersecurity vendor Human Security.</strong>
</p><p>As part of the global cybercriminal operation called <a href="https://www.humansecurity.com/hubfs/HUMAN_Report_BADBOX-and-PEACHPIT.pdf">BadBox</a> (PDF), Human Security found a threat actor relied on supply chain compromise to infect the firmware of more than 70,000 Android smartphones, CTV boxes, and tablet devices with the Triada malware.
</p><p>The infected devices come from at least one Chinese manufacturer but, before they are delivered to resellers, physical retail stores, and e-commerce warehouses, a backdoor was injected into their firmware.
</p><p>“Products known to contain the backdoor have been found on public school networks throughout the United States,” Human says.
</p><p>Discovered in 2016, <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/triada-trojan-most-advanced-mobile-malware-yet-kaspersky/">Triada is a modular trojan</a> residing in a device’s RAM, relying on the Zygote process to hook all applications on Android, actively using root privileges to substitute system files. Over time, <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/android-trojan-uses-sandbox-evade-detection/">the malware went through various iterations</a> and was found<a href="https://www.securityweek.com/triada-trojan-preinstalled-low-cost-android-devices/"> pre-installed on low-cost Android devices</a> on<a href="https://www.securityweek.com/triada-trojan-pre-installed-low-cost-android-smartphones/"> at least two occasions</a>.
</p><p>As part of the BadBox operation that Human Security discovered, the infected low-cost Android devices allow threat actors to carry out various ad-fraud schemes, including one named PeachPit, which at its peak relied on 121,000 Android and 159,000 iOS devices infected with malware, and on 39 Android, iOS, and CTV-centric apps designed to connect to a fake supply-side platform (SSP).
</p><p>One of the modules delivered to the infected devices from the command-and-control (C&amp;C) server allows the creation of WebViews that are fully hidden from the user, but which “are used to request, render, and click on ads, spoofing the ad requests to look like they’re coming from certain apps, referred by certain websites, and rendered” on specific devices.</p>
<p>BadBox, Human Security notes, also includes a residential proxy module that allows the threat actors to sell access to the victim’s network. Furthermore, they can create WhatsApp messaging accounts and Gmail accounts they can then use for other malicious activities.
</p><p>“Finally, because of the backdoor’s connection to C2 servers on BadBox-infected smartphones, tablets, and CTV boxes, new apps or code can be remotely installed by the threat actors without the device owner’s permission. The threat actors behind BadBox could develop entirely new schemes and deploy them on BadBox-infected devices without any interaction from the devices’ owners,” Human notes.
</p><p>The cybersecurity firm says that it has managed to disrupt the PeachPit ad fraud scheme and that the BadBox operators have taken down their C&amp;C servers, likely to adapt and circumvent the deployed defensive measures.
</p><p>Human also warns that BadBox-infected devices cannot be cleaned by the end-users, since the backdoor resides in the firmware partition and that almost all infected devices are lower-price-point, recommending that users choose familiar brands when purchasing new products.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>In the last year at </span><a href="https://www.tanda.co/" rel="">Tanda</a><span>, we’ve gone from being a single-product company, to launching a bunch of new products that all work together really well.</span></p><p><span> This has got me reflecting on the different phases of product strategy over the last decade, as we went from no product to a market leader.</span></p><p><span>If you find this interesting you might also enjoy </span><em><a href="https://ghiculescu.substack.com/p/11-years-of-hosting-a-saas" rel="">11 years of hosting a SaaS</a></em><span>. </span></p><p>This is the phase that all products, projects, and companies start at. There is nothing built, there is only an idea. In this phase all you should do is build enough of the idea that you can present it to people who’d use or buy it and see what they think. Startup people call that an MVP.</p><p>Planning at this stage is actually quite useful, but it looks very different to planning later on. Anyone experienced with product planning at a mature company will need to unlearn a lot to succeed here. That’s because “planning” here is writing 2 sentence summaries of what needs to get built.</p><blockquote><p>We are going to make an employee time clock that runs on an Android device. It will connect to a website in the cloud so you don’t need any dedicated IT support.</p></blockquote><p>Some people say you should start with a market, and then tailor your product to that. Go out and interview 100 similar potential buyers, figure out something they want, and build exactly that. In my experience, this advice is often given and (correctly) never followed. If you don’t already know about something that people want that you can explain in 2 sentences, then you shouldn’t be starting a business.</p><p>If you insist on the customer research approach, at least work on your script. When wannabe founders ask me if they can do “a customer development interview to identify potential pain points and riff on product ideas”, all I hear is that the call will be a waste of my time.</p><p>You’ve built the first two sentences of your product, and managed to get some people to use it (hopefully to pay for it too). At this stage it can seem pretty obvious what to build next, because you have way less features than what customers expect. You’re on the way to product market fit.</p><p><span>For Tanda, this was the case for award interpretation, rosters, the early, simple, versions of timesheets and leave, and payroll exports.</span></p><p><span>Why were they obvious? Obvious to who? Here’s how I think about it. When talking to a customer or prospect, if instead of asking “does it do X?”, they ask “how do you do X?”, and you can’t confidently answer “oh, you </span><em>don’t</em><span> do X, and here’s why”, then that is an obvious gap. 1) The customer assumed the functionality is there, so it’s an obvious requirement to them. 2) You don’t have a justification for it not being there</span></p><p><span>, so implicitly it’s obvious to you.</span></p><p>When it’s obvious what to build next, product planning is easy. Pick one obvious thing, build the simplest version of it that you can, and repeat. Steer clear of “prioritising”; if you need to prioritise things then implicitly admitting that it’s not obvious what needs to get built, and during this phase you should only build truly obvious things. Pick whichever obvious thing you got asked about most recently, build it, and repeat.</p><p>Seasoned product managers will warn you that if you do this too much you will end up building all sorts of random disparate features that don’t work well together and are not consistent. They’re not wrong, but they miss the part where if you don’t do that you’ll go broke. During this phase, you should build lots of things, accept some of them will suck and attract bad customers, and use this intel to identify who your ideal customers are. Then gradually remove the features, and customers, you don’t want.</p><p><span>While prioritisation is a bad thing during this phase, scoping is not. It’s tempting to get carried away by making a really sophisticated version of your obvious need. Either one that does too many niche things, or one that is too polished. This is where the saying “</span><a href="https://twitter.com/reidhoffman/status/847142924240379904?lang=en" rel="">if you’re not embarrassed by your v1, you shipped too late</a><span>” comes from; the first version of every obvious feature should look a bit ugly, and should only have functionality that 100% of customers will use exactly the same way. All the other stuff, you can come back to later. It’s tempting to plan ahead because you’re “sure” you’ll need some functionality soon. Resist this temptation; even if “soon” actually comes soon (it often doesn’t!) it’s still better to aggressively restrict your scope and add the extra bits later.</span></p><p><span>During this phase you will get asked for lots of things that are not actually obvious needs. For us, a mobile app for employees was the most classic example. We didn’t have one on the app store for the first 4 years of Tanda. We got asked “how do employees install the app?” all the time. Our answer: there’s a mobile website</span></p><p><span>, and everything important also happens over email and SMS</span></p><p><span>. So you see - we’d explain to customers - you don’t </span><em>need</em><span> an app, but what you do need is a really accurate award interpreter, and only we have that.</span></p><p>We didn’t say this because we were fundamentally opposed to native apps. Eventually we built one. But for a long time, it just wasn’t as important as other things we could have built with our really small team.</p><p>All of a sudden you’ll find that all the really obvious stuff has been built. Suddenly prioritisation goes from being really easy, to really hard. You’re drowning in feature requests, bug reports, suggestions (that are phrased as requests), complaints about technical debt, and a million other inputs. And while most of them don’t seem like bad ideas, none of them seem critical either.</p><p>Now you have to actually prioritise.</p><p>I found this transition really difficult. I’d spent years building whatever felt like a good idea and being right more often than not. Now everyone was saying we couldn’t keep doing that and we needed to create a lot of new process to protect ourselves from us building the wrong thing. In hindsight, I should have been more skeptical of the sudden need for drastic change. But I wasn’t, and so we lent into transforming how we did product strategy.</p><p>We got a lot of things wrong over many years while trying to find the right of balancing our intrinsic scrappiness with the new and constantly growing number of customers that relied on us. Here’s some things that didn’t work:</p><p><strong>Succumbing to pressure from big customers</strong></p><p>Big customers will always ask you to build something that everyone knows only they will use. A million people have written the advice that if 1 customer dictates your roadmap then you need to say no. It’s still hard to resist, the first time you have that opportunity.</p><p><span>I thought the reason you aren’t meant to do this is because then you’ll never get off the treadmill of building whatever that customer wants. We were on that treadmill for years with our first enterprise customer, but it actually wasn’t that hard to step off once we really committed to do it. We got very firm about explaining how we’d like to work (citing </span><a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup" rel="">a book</a><span> helped make it more official), and they respected that and let us work our way.</span></p><p><span>The real problem is that when you are building something a single customer is pressuring you for, it’s incredibly hard to build it in a way that different customers will be able to use.</span></p><p><span> Before we learned this, we built a few features for big important customers, and those features work really well if you’re the same size, and in the same industry, as those customers. For anyone else, they’re too confusing to bother. It took a long time to internalise this and properly try to make them work for all customers. We still haven’t perfected that but it’s a lot better than when we started.</span></p><p>Scarred by getting this wrong a few times, we made a big decision: we won’t build features if only a single customer wants them. This sounded good on paper. In practice it resulted in…</p><p><strong>“Prioritisation” by sorting by MRR</strong></p><p>This is a phenomenon when any internal proposal for a feature (sometimes bug reports too!) includes a list of prospects or customers that have suggested the feature, and their corresponding revenue. Prioritisation becomes picking whichever item has the biggest revenue associated with it.</p><p>The implication is “if we build this feature we’ll win all these new customers” or “if we don’t build this feature we’ll lose all these customers”. It’s never true. It’s very rare to see someone buy or churn off a business software product exclusively because of one feature’s existence. If that’s happening often, and you want those customers, you don’t need prioritisation!</p><p>This methodology is one of those things where there’s enough merit to it that it sounds reasonable in theory, but actually is a total mess in practice. Salespeople and account managers can be very convincing, and it’s really hard to resist the allure of just building what they ask. At the same time, it’s bad to not listen to them at all. To make good product decisions when it’s not obvious what to build next, you need to walk the tightrope between those extremes.</p><p><strong>Forced innovation</strong></p><p><span>Worn down by MRR-based-development, a few teams drew a line in the sand. “From now on, we’re only going to bet on big, chunky, innovative things.” This was very popular internally. Developers love working on “big” projects.</span></p><p><span> Everyone loves innovative new things. What’s not to like?</span></p><p><span>The problem with forcing innovation is that it assumes there is an endless supply of game changing ideas floating around your company, and the only reason you haven’t built them yet is because the product team didn’t want to. If this is true for your company, you’re on the verge of being obscenely rich. But for most companies this isn’t the case. </span><a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/amazons-operating-system/" rel="">You don’t make good products because you really want to, you make good products by fostering the conditions in which great products can be made</a><span>. An environment where every 6 weeks teams pick which big new innovation they’ll be launching is not one that invents anything new.</span></p><p>That’s what we learned, from trying to force this. We saw lots of complex features with fancy names come from this, but nothing that substantially changed the lives or fortunes of our customers.</p><p><strong>Data-driven development</strong></p><p><span>Like most product teams, we spent a lot of time buying and setting up product analytics tools like </span><a href="https://amplitude.com/" rel="">Amplitude</a><span>. Like most product teams, we spent virtually no time using the data inside Amplitude to make good decisions.</span></p><p>Amplitude is a cool tool and it’s well built. I’m sure there are some kinds of product, and some kinds of company, where it’s really useful for finding diamonds of insight. But in our B2B SaaS world, it only uncovered really obvious things we already knew (“lots of people log in every day”, “everyone uses user profiles regularly”).</p><p><span>Same goes for recording tools like </span><a href="https://www.fullstory.com/" rel="">FullStory</a><span>. We were able to uncover a few bugs that were hard to replicate otherwise - and I’m glad we did - but we did not discover brilliant untapped product insights from watching screen recordings of our settings pages.</span></p><p><span>All these tools are a bad proxy for talking to customers.</span></p><p>This is where we’re at today. As we’ve grown as a company, we’ve found that the biggest impact we get when building features comes when the rest of the company can also align its work with that feature.</p><p>This sounds obvious, but it’s a pretty big change from the early days of having the feature idea over breakfast, shipping it after dinner, and hoping your customers discover it.</p><p><span>For example, a few years ago, we added a bunch of improvements to how we handle different kinds of lunch breaks in the shifts people work. To market this, we sent all our prospects a </span><a href="https://www.creativemoment.co/creative-classic-how-and-why-have-a-break-have-a-kit-kat-has-lasted-60-years" rel="">Kit Kat</a><span> in the mail, as well as a flyer about what we’d built. Mailing people stuff is a surprisingly big logistical challenge, but it worked really well to draw attention to what we were doing and get people talking about it. It also got the whole company talking about the same thing. Between designing and building the features and putting Kit Kats in boxes, everyone was aware of what was going on and could make sure they understood the new features well so they could explain them to customers.</span></p><p>I’ve found there’s two cadences that really matter, and if you can get product happening on those cadences then things will work well.</p><ul><li><p>If you do your product thinking on the same cadence as that every other team prioritises work on, you can work together better.</p></li><li><p>If you do your product thinking on a cadence that matches how customers will deploy new features, they’ll be more comfortable with your pace of deployment.</p></li></ul><p><span>In our case it turned out the answer to both of these was every 3 months. We use </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results" rel="">OKR</a><span>s across the entire company. Every 3 months the OKRs get refreshed. About a month before that, we pick what the product theme for the next quarter will be. OKRs flow down from that, and the individual pieces of work get shaped from that.</span></p><p>This means every team knows broadly what areas we are thinking about, where to expect improvement, and is able to align it with their work.</p><p>This is where we are at today, I’m sure in the future I’ll write an update about all the stuff that we got wrong here.</p><p>We’re building and launching new products at the moment, which has got me reflecting on this, because those new products are still in Phase 1 (or 0!). It’s so obvious what to build next because there’s still lots of stuff missing! But as a result, we’re getting it done really quickly, knowing we’ll get some things wrong and have to rebuild some stuff along the way.</p><p><span>I wish I’d thought more about </span><em>when</em><span> to add a second product a long time ago. It’s a bit like having kids: most people assume they’ll do it one day, but want to wait until they’re ready. If you wait for an email telling you you’re ready, you’ll never do it. So it is with many things, and I found that once we started building a second product it was not as hard as expected, and much more rewarding. I was most surprised by how much happier customers who buy more products seem to be, which I think has really energised everyone.</span></p><p>Should we have done it earlier? I think so. It would have been harder, we would have been less ready, we’d have gotten more things wrong, and we’d have been more stretched between products - but there’s a lot of sunk cost fallacy to that line of thinking.</p><p>More usefully: should someone who’s just moving from Phase 1 to Phase 2 consider adding a second product as an alternative on going deeper on the existing one? Absolutely you should at least consider it, even if you decide not to after weighing it up.</p><p>If I had a time machine to go back to 2012 and give myself a few pointers, what would I say? 3 big tips:</p><p><strong>Be less afraid of adding new products/markets</strong><span>. I was always really reluctant to consider new products, or new countries (which is basically a new product in our world). It seemed like a lot of hard work that would distract from focusing on the core product. I underestimated how much it would energise the team and increase focus.</span></p><p><strong>Change/remove features if they aren’t working</strong><span>. There’s a lot of product management advice that boils down to “say no to feature ideas”. This is easy to prescribe, and hard to do. But I wish I’d gotten better at changing features, or scrapping them, if they weren’t working well for the majority of customers or were clearly too confusing.</span></p><p><strong>The best product strategy is to build what your customers say they’ll buy</strong><span>. As cliche as it is, there is always temptation to come up with other sources of inspiration for the right thing to build. These should be resisted. If you build what your customers are asking for you’ll build too much stuff, it won’t work together properly, and it’ll be confusing in your UI. But if you build stuff your customers aren’t asking for, you won’t be troubled by having customers for much longer.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>
