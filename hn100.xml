<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Inkjets Are for More Than Just Printing" data-elid="2667578405" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/inkjet-printer" data-authors="Phillip W. Barth, Leslie A. Field" data-page-title="A Brief History of Inkjet Printers - IEEE Spectrum"><p><strong>In the early 1980s,</strong> offices were noisy places, filled with the sound of metal striking inked ribbons to mark characters on paper. IBM Selectric typewriters clacked, daisy wheel printers clattered, and dot-matrix printers made loud ripping sounds.
</p><p>
	Today, those noises are gone. And though we do spend more time reading on screens, we haven’t stopped printing on paper.
</p><p>
	The main reason for the quiet? The inkjet printer. While laser printers do the big printing jobs in commercial settings, the inkjet printer has become 
	<em>the</em> printer most of us use at home and at the office.
</p><p>
	The printhead of an inkjet printer performs a remarkable task. Even at the coarse resolution of 96 dots per inch (dpi), as was typical for the first models in the 1980s, the distance from dot center to dot center is a mere 260 micrometers. To fill a standard letter page that has 2.5-centimeter margins would require more than half a million individual ink droplets. Delivery of those tiny droplets involves moving them with very precise control, repeated a vast number of times as rapidly as possible. This process is ideally suited for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEMS" target="_blank">microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)</a>, which are electronic devices with microscopic components that employ movement.
</p><p>If there is a way to package something in microscopic droplets with the appropriate fluid properties, chances are someone is looking to adapt inkjet technology to work with it.</p><p>
	As with all microtechnology, the specs of inkjet systems have evolved considerably over time. A typical inkjet printhead in the mid-1980s had 12 nozzles working in parallel, each one emitting up to 1,350 droplets per second, to print 150 alphanumeric characters per second. Today, a high-end inkjet printhead used in a commercial printing press may contain 21,000 nozzles, each nozzle printing 20,000 to 150,000 dots per second. Each drop of ink may be just 1.5 picoliters—a picoliter is one-trillionth of a liter—and measure roughly 14 micrometers in diameter.
</p><p>
	Surpassing the visions of its creators, the inkjet technology used in these printers has found a host of applications beyond putting dots on paper. These include making DNA microarrays for genomics, creating electrical traces for printed circuit boards, and building 3D-printed structures. Future uses could include personalized medicine and development of advanced batteries.
</p><p>
	Indeed, a search for patents containing the word “inkjet” today returns more than 92,000 results. If there is a way to package something in microscopic droplets with the appropriate fluid properties, chances are someone is looking to adapt inkjet technology to work with it.
</p><h2>How MEMS Transformed Inkjet Printing</h2><p><a href="https://library.imaging.org/admin/apis/public/api/ist/website/downloadArticle/jist/42/1/art00007" target="_blank">Inkjet technology</a> dates back to 1948, when Swedish inventor 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rune_Elmqvist" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rune Elmqvist</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US2566443A/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">patented</a> a chart recorder wherein a very thin glass tube emitting a continuous jet of ink was steered to make a trace on a moving strip of paper. A couple of years later, <a href="https://ecglibrary.com/ecghist.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he demonstrated</a> his invention in the form of <a href="https://carl-kulturen-com.translate.goog/medi/web/object/45610?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp" target="_blank">a device</a> for recording electrocardiograms.
</p><p>
	In 1965, Richard G. Sweet of Stanford University 
	<a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1719502" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">developed a chart recorder</a> in which the jet of ink was broken into a uniform stream of electrically charged droplets. Diverter electrodes on either side of the stream could permit the drops to proceed straight to the paper, or else deflect them onto an absorbent pad or into a gutter to be collected and reused.

The Thinkjet’s ink cartridge [bottom] delivered thousands of microscopic droplets a second from 12 nozzles. The MEMS technology to perform that feat was entirely within the printhead.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">HP</small></p><p>
	This technology is called continuous inkjet printing, and by 1976 IBM had incorporated it in a commercial printer, the 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_6640" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IBM 6640</a>. But continuous inkjets lose ink to evaporation even when recycling is used, limiting their appeal.
</p><p>
	To get around the wastefulness of continuous inkjets, others worked on developing drop-on-demand inkjet printers, where each orifice on the printhead emits one drop of ink at a time, avoiding the waste of a continual flow of drops. Surface tension holds the ink in place in a tiny open nozzle until a mechanism pushes the ink to eject a drop. Each drop hitting the paper creates a dot, and moving the printhead back and forth builds up an image. A printhead with multiple orifices can emit many drops of ink simultaneously, so each pass of the printhead across the page adds a strip of the image, not just a single drop-thin line.
</p><p>
	In the late 1970s, Siemens was the first to sell a drop-on-demand inkjet printer. It came not as a stand-alone device like a modern desktop printer, but as an integral part of a computer terminal, the 
	<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_PT80i" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Siemens PT80i</a> (Printer Terminal 80 Inkjet). The printer used piezoelectric actuators surrounding 12 ink tubes, which fed 12 nozzles to shoot ink droplets, printing 270 characters per second.
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectricity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Piezoelectric</a> devices rely on how some materials, such as ceramic lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT), change shape when subjected to a voltage. This effect has proved extremely useful in MEMS in general, for generating precise forces and motion on command. If a layer of PZT is bonded to a nonpiezoelectric material, forming what’s called a bimorph, it will bend when exposed to a voltage. In the piezoelectric inkjet nozzle, the bending of the bimorph pushes ink out of the orifice. [For another application of piezoelectric MEMS technology, see “<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/mems-ultrasound-history" target="_blank">How Ultrasound Became Ultra Small</a>.”]

	This novel printing technology, however, was not yet as dependable as proven impact printers in the 1970s, and the whole Siemens terminal became unusable if the printer failed, so it didn’t catch on.
</p><p>
	Meanwhile, researchers at both Hewlett-Packard and Canon noticed that ink would boil and splatter when exposed to a hot element like a soldering iron, and they decided to turn that splattering into a useful inkjet printing mechanism. They knew that a resistor could be used as a heating element and could be miniaturized with the same technology as that used for integrated circuits. In the printers they built, each ink nozzle contains a resistor instead of a piezoelectric actuator. An electrical pulse heats the resistor, which flash-boils a thin layer of the ink, forming a rapidly expanding vapor bubble that pushes a droplet of ink out through the orifice.
</p><p>
	This work led to two <a href="https://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/museum/imagingprinting/0011/index.html" target="_blank">competing</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://global.canon/en/news/2015/aug26e2.html" target="_blank">versions</a> of thermal inkjet technology coming to market at nearly the same time 40 years ago. (The same year, 1984, Epson introduced a stand-alone 
	<a href="https://corporate.epson/en/about/history/milestone-products/1984-10-sq2000.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">piezoelectric inkjet printer</a>.)
</p><p>
	Hewlett-Packard’s 
	<a href="https://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/museum/imagingprinting/0011/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HP ThinkJet</a> was its first desktop inkjet printer based on its thermal technology, and it was designed to connect to a personal computer for everyday printing. It had an immediate advantage over the recently developed laser printers: It was much cheaper. A desktop laser printer from HP cost US $3,500 (about $10,500 today); HP’s 2225A ThinkJet cost only $495 ($1,500 today). Inkjet printers also used far less power than laser printers did and were quieter. Admittedly, inkjets didn’t have great resolution—96 dpi compared with 300 for laser printers in those early days—and they were slow.
</p><p>
	But the advantages outweighed the disadvantages (more so as the technology improved), and inkjet printers came to dominate the desktop and home printer markets. Today, more than 20 companies make inkjet printers, generating a market of 
	<a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/report/inkjet-printing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than $100 billion</a> annually and continuing to grow at more than 8 percent per year.
</p><h2>Printing DNA Microarrays With Inkjets</h2><p>
	While the business of making inkjet printers matured and grew, some companies began exploring what other kinds of “ink” might be delivered with an inkjet. One of these was Agilent Technologies, a spin-off of Hewlett Packard with a focus on life-science and chemical-analysis technologies. Agilent developed a way to print strands of DNA from the four nucleic acid bases—cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A), and thymine (T). Specifically, the company adapted existing DNA chemistries plus inkjet printing techniques to build 
	<a href="https://www.agilent.com/library/applications/5989-9159en_lo.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">microarrays of DNA</a> on glass slides for <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/cmr.00019-09" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">genomics work</a>, such as measuring which genes are being expressed in an organism under various conditions. Academic researchers have shared open-source methods for <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2004-5-8-r58" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">converting existing inkjet printers</a> to build their own microarrays, albeit with specs that are much more modest than the commercial systems.
</p><p>
	A DNA microarray consists of a substrate, usually glass, with an array of small regions called spots where DNA strands are attached. Agilent produces arrays with as many as a million spots on a single 2.5-by-7.6-cm slide. An open-source system puts up to 10,000 in a somewhat smaller area. Each DNA strand is made of sequences of the bases C, G, A, and T. In double-stranded DNA, the strands have complementary sequences, which join up like rungs of a ladder, C joining with G, and A with T.
</p><p>
	A DNA microarray uses single-stranded DNA, and each spot has millions of strands with a common sequence. When a sample with copies of the complementary strand washes over the spot, those strands bind together with the strands anchored in the spot. The sample strands are tagged with fluorescent molecules, and the user learns which DNA sequences were present in the sample by examining which spots light up.
</p><p>
	In Agilent’s method for fabricating a microarray, the printer makes multiple passes over the substrate, each pass adding one base to each strand in the spots, with intermediate steps to prepare for the next pass.
</p><p>
	Adding a base is actually a three-step process. Each of the growing strands in the microarray spots has a molecular “cap” at the end that prevents the indiscriminate addition of more bases. So the first step is to remove or deactivate those caps by washing a solution over the nascent microarray. The second step is analogous to printing a page: At each spot on the microarray, the inkjet adds a dot of liquid containing the next monomer molecule (modified versions of C, G, A, or T) to be added to the end of the strand. These monomers each include a new cap so that only one molecule gets added to each strand. Although the newly added monomers are now attached to the strands, the connection is not fully stable, and so the third step applies an oxidizer solution that modifies the bonds, fully integrating the new monomers into the DNA structure. Rinse and repeat.
</p><p>
	The versatility of the open-source inkjet construction allows researchers to rapidly build prototype arrays with whatever sequences they want to try out. A new array can be designed, synthesized, and used to analyze DNA in a single day. 
	<a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2004-5-8-r58" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One group</a> reported a cycle time of 10 to 20 minutes to attach each base with their system, or about 13 hours to produce a batch of arrays, each with about 10,000 spots containing 40-base strands. For comparison’s sake, Agilent’s commercial microarrays typically have strands up to 60 bases long.
</p><p>
	Agilent also uses its inkjet system to synthesize another genomic workhorse known as an 
	<a href="https://www.agilent.com/en/solutions/genomics-applications-solutions/ols" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">oligonucleotide library</a>. The process is the same as for making a microarray, but at the end all the strands are cleaved from the substrate, dried, and packaged together in a single tube for the customer. Agilent’s inkjet-printed libraries have strands up to about 230 bases long.

	In addition to printing two-dimensional pages and building one-dimensional molecular strands, inkjet technology has for many years been used to produce three-dimensional objects. One approach is a variant of powder-bed 3D printing, in which objects are built up by fusing or binding layers of powder in the desired pattern. The inkjet printhead applies droplets of a liquid binding agent to each layer of powder in the regions that will form the finished 3D items.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/printers/3d-printers/products/multi-jet-technology.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HP Multi Jet Fusion (MJF)</a> line of 3D printers extends this approach by depositing two types of ink: One is a binding promoter and the other a detailing agent, which is applied at the edges of the pattern to prevent the promoter from bleeding into the surrounding powder. A printhead carrying a wide array of inkjet nozzles dispenses these inks, and the array is quickly followed by a lighting bar to heat the powder, fusing it in the regions where the binding promoter is present. A fresh layer of powder is then spread over the entire printing area in readiness for the next cycle of the process. At the end, compressed air and a vacuum hose remove the unfused powder to reveal the completed 3D objects. The HP MJF printers perform this in a volume of up to 38 by 28 by 38 cm.</p><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"><img id="49468" data-rm-shortcode-id="8807012fcdad4f97b39c08dc12e24c17" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-3d-printed-vacuum.jpg?id=51828525&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-3d-printed-vacuum.jpg?id=51828525&amp;width=980" width="2000" height="1392" alt="Photo of a 3D printed vacuum."><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">This model of a handheld vacuum cleaner with colored, translucent, and transparent parts was printed in one piece on a Mimaki inkjet 3D printer.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Mimaki Engineering Co.</small></p><p>A quite different approach has been taken by 
	<a href="https://mimaki.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mimaki Engineering Co.</a> of Japan, which has introduced <a href="https://www.mimakiusa.com/products/3d/3duj-553/" target="_blank">3D printers</a> with piezoelectric inkjet heads that dispense droplets of resin. The resins are photopolymers that are cured by ultraviolet light-emitting diodes after each layer is printed. Instead of using a powder bed that fills the entire build area, the printer deposits the resins on top of the growing structure. To deal with steep overhangs—such as an outstretched arm of a figurine—one of the resins produces a water-soluble material, which is used to build supports where needed. After the build is finished, these supports can be dissolved away.
</p><p>
	Seven other resins provide colors that can include CMYK—the familiar cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks of consumer inkjet printers—as well as white and clear, for a total of 10 million color combinations, comparable to the color depth that the human eye can discriminate. The resulting parts can combine solid color, colored transparency and translucency, and colorless transparency.
</p><p>
	The printer provides a volume for building that measures 51 by 51 by 30 cm. Unlike with a powder-bed machine, small test parts can be made without filling the entire volume. In general, however, the Mimaki approach is slower than that of the HP MJF because it uses smaller printheads instead of a wide one that can cross the entire area in one sweep.
</p><h2>Inkjet’s Future</h2><p>
	Inkjet printing’s strength is the ability to pattern various inks over large areas in short, rapid production runs at a reasonable cost. It cannot generally compete with standard high-volume production approaches, because those will usually be cheaper. Thus, a car enthusiast, for instance, may embrace 3D inkjet printing to make bespoke parts for repairs or other tinkering, but a high-volume car-parts manufacturer is not going to introduce such printers to its factory lines. Similarly, a company may build individual figurines from a customer’s design, printed by 3D inkjet, but the same technique won’t be economical for mass-producing models of the latest superhero. With many potential applications, it isn’t clear if there is a niche where the inkjet approach will win.
</p><p>
	An example is the use of 3D inkjet printing for 
	<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348562139_3D_Printing_as_a_Promising_Tool_in_Personalized_Medicine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">personalized medicine</a>. The idea is to produce tablets of a medication customized for a specific patient. Such personalized pills can include simple fine-tuning of the dose for an individual, as well as adjustments to the drug’s release rate—from very rapid to slow and sustained—through modifications to the binding agents and structure of the tablet. Rather than juggling multiple medications on a complicated schedule each day, a patient could take a single daily polypill—a 3D-printed tablet containing multiple medications, each with a different rate of release.
</p><p>
	Researchers are exploring how to adapt existing 3D printing techniques, including inkjet, to make these personalized medications. Inkjet systems are particularly suited for printing drugs in the form of thin films, such as transdermal patches to be applied to the skin and buccal films to be held in the cheek, where drugs can pass directly to the bloodstream without first going through the digestive system.
</p><p><img id="cb401" data-rm-shortcode-id="20c0c8188de16d7dbdd111b77709f19b" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-illustrating-use-of-inkjet-to-build-a-dna-microarray.png?id=51816847&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/diagram-illustrating-use-of-inkjet-to-build-a-dna-microarray.png?id=51816847&amp;width=980" width="1500" height="728" alt="Diagram illustrating use of inkjet to build a DNA microarray."><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">A DNA microarray can be fabricated using an inkjet system to build custom-designed strands of DNA at each spot of the array. The printhead delivers a droplet of “ink” [left] containing modified monomers of one nucleotide [G, C, A, or T] to each spot. On the first print cycle, these monomers attach to the chemically treated glass surface. On subsequent print runs [right], a single monomer joins on the end of each growing DNA strand. Each monomer includes a protective cap to prevent other monomers from joining. Additional processes [not depicted here] wash away the nucleotide ink, apply a catalyst to complete the monomer bonding, and strip away the protective caps in preparation for the next printing step.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Chris Philpot</small></p><p>
	These printed personalized medicines, however, would be expensive compared to fixed doses rolling off standard high-volume production lines. Thus the technique is likely to be reserved for relatively rare conditions.
</p><p>
	Another potential application of 3D inkjet printing is in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e12623" target="_blank">fabrication of advanced lithium-ion batteries</a>. The charging and discharging of these batteries relies on lithium ions moving from the battery’s electrodes to its electrolyte and back again, in the process releasing or absorbing electrons that produce the current flow. The energy-storage density of the standard electrode design can be increased by using thicker electrodes, but this compromises the power density—the rate of energy release—because a smaller proportion of the electrode is in close contact with the electrolyte.
</p><p>
	A 3D inkjet could build electrodes with a detailed microstructure that allows the electrolyte to penetrate throughout the electrode volume. This could boost the ability of the active lithium ions and electrons to reach the entire electrode efficiently even when the electrode is larger, thereby increasing the energy storage and power density in tandem. For this vision to become a reality, however, researchers will need to learn more about how to formulate the “inks” for printing these electrodes: What are the best particle sizes and solvents to make an ink with fluid properties suitable for use in an inkjet system and that will produce stable printed structures with good electrochemical properties?
</p><p>
	We think it is unlikely, however, that inkjet printing could compete with high-volume manufacturing on price. Inkjet printing of prototypes, on the other hand, may uncover an optimal battery design that can then be adapted for production by conventional techniques.
</p><p>
	 Inkjet systems have been demonstrated for a wide variety of applications beyond what we have discussed above: 
	<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bprint.2021.e00157" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Living cells can be printed</a>, for instance, to form tissue structures for in vitro experiments. MEMS such as <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/982863" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">microscopic motors</a> have been printed using inks containing nanoparticles of gold and silver as conductors and resin-based inks to act as insulators. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-59432-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Flexible sensors</a> for health care monitoring have been printed using an electrically conducting polymer that responds to temperature differentials. And then there are all the ways inkjets are used to create images on media other than office printouts, such as printing of textiles, <a href="https://www.sae.org/site/news/2021/03/abb-inkjet-type-printers-enable-custom-automotive-paint-jobs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inkjet robots</a> to apply custom automotive paint jobs, and the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gicl%C3%A9e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Giclée</a>” printing of fine art using archival-quality inks and substrates.
</p><p>
	Each of these applications is like a colored dot on the vast canvas of human technology and activity. And while the dots from inkjets, powered by MEMS, may be only a single color among many others on that metaphorical page, the picture would be very different without them.

Because it is designed to speed up operations involving tensors. Precisely, what operations though? The operations are referred to … as a “map (multilinear relationship) between different objects such as vectors, scalars, and even other tensors”.</p><p>Let’s take a simple example. A two-dimensional array can describe a multilinear relationship between two one-dimensional arrays. The mathematically inclined will recognize the process of getting from one vector to the other as multiplying a vector by a matrix to get another vector.</p><p>This can be generalized to tensors representing the relationship between higher dimensional arrays. However, although tensors describe the relationship between arbitrary higher-dimensional arrays, in practice the TPU hardware that we will consider is designed to perform calculations associated with one and two-dimensional arrays. Or, more specifically, vector and matrix operations.</p></blockquote><p>Let’s look at one of these operations, matrix multiplication.

They are multiplied together and the result is stored.</p><p><em>Step 2:</em></p><p>Values a12 and b21 are loaded into the top left MAC. They are multiplied together and added to the previously calculated result. This gives the top left value of the results matrix.</p><p>Meanwhile, b11 is transferred to the top right MAC where it is multiplied by the newly loaded value a21 and the result is stored. Also, a11 is transferred to the bottom left MAC where it is multiplied by the newly loaded value b12, and the result is stored.</p><p><em>Step 3:</em></p><p>b21 is transferred to the top right MAC where it is multiplied by the newly loaded value a22 and the result is added to the previously stored result. Also, a12 is transferred to the bottom left MAC where it is multiplied by the newly loaded value b22, and the result is added to the previously stored result. In this step, we have calculated the top right and bottom left values of the results matrix.</p><p>Meanwhile, a12 and b21 are transferred to the bottom right MAC where they are multiplied and the result is stored.</p><p><em>Step 4:&nbsp;</em></p><p>Finally, a22 and b22 are transferred to the bottom right MAC where they are multiplied and the result is added to the previously stored value giving the bottom right value of the results matrix.</p><p>So the results of the matrix multiplication emerge down a moving ‘diagonal’ in the matrix of MACs.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>In our example, it takes 4 steps to do a 2 x 2 matrix multiplication, but only because some of the MACs are not utilized at the start and end of the calculation. In practice, a new matrix multiplication would start top left as soon as the MAC is free. As a result the unit is capable of a new matrix multiplication every two cycles.</p><p>This is a simplified representation of how a systolic array works and we’ve glossed over some of the details of the implementation of the systolic array in TPU v1. I hope that the principles of how this architecture works are clear though.</p><p>This is the simplest possible matrix multiplication but can be extended to bigger matrices with larger arrays of multiplication units.</p><p>The key point is that if data is fed into the systolic array in the right order then the flow of values and results through the system will ensure that the required results emerge from the array over time.</p><p>Crucially there is no need to store and fetch intermediate results from a ‘main memory’ area. Intermediate results are automatically available when needed due to the structure of the matrix multiply unit and the order in which inputs are fed into the unit.</p><p>Of course, the matrix multiply unit does not sit in isolation and the simplest presentation of the complete system is as follows:</p><p><span>The first thing to note is that TPUv1 relies on communication with the host computer over a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express" rel="">PCIe</a><span> (high speed serial bus) interface. It also has direct access to its own DDR3 Dynamic RAM storage.</span></p><p>We can expand this to a more detailed presentation of the design:</p><p>Let’s pick some key elements from this presentation of the design, starting at the top and moving (broadly) clockwise:</p><ul><li><p><strong>DDR3 DRAM / Weight FIFO:</strong><span> Weights are stored in DDR3 RAM chips connected to the TPU v1 via DDR3-2133 interfaces. Weights are ‘pre-loaded’ onto these chips from the host computer’s memory via PCIe and can then be transferred into the ‘Weight FIFO’ memory ready for use by the matrix multiply unit.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Matrix Multiply Unit: </strong><span>This is a ‘systolic’ array with 256 x 256 matrix multiply/accumulate units that is fed by 256 ‘weight’ values from the top and 256 data inputs from the left.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Accumulators:</strong><span> The results emerge from the systolic matrix unit at the bottom and are stored in ‘accumulator’ memory storage.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Activation: </strong><span>The activation functions described in the neural network above are applied here.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Unified Buffer / Systolic Data Setup: </strong><span>The results of applying the activation functions are stored in a ‘unified buffer’ memory where they are ready to be fed back as inputs to the Matrix Multiply Unit to calculate the values needed for the next layer.</span></p></li></ul><p>So far we haven’t specified the nature of the multiplications performed by the matrix multiply unit. TPU v1 performs 8-bit x 8-bit integer multiplications, making use of quantization to avoid the need for more die-area-hungry floating-point calculations.</p><p>The TPU v1 uses a CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) design with around only about 20 instructions. It’s important to note that these instructions are sent to it by the host computer over the PCIe interface, rather than being fetched from memory.</p><p>The five key instructions are as follows:</p><p><em><strong>Read_Host_Memory</strong></em></p><p>Reads input values from the host computer’s memory into the Unified Buffer over PCIe.</p><p><em><strong>Read_Weights</strong></em></p><p>Read weights from the weight memory into the Weight FIFO. Note that the weight memory will already have been loaded with weights read from the computer’s main memory over PCIe.</p><p><em><strong>Matrix_Multiply / Convolve</strong></em></p><p>From the paper this instruction</p><blockquote><p>… causes the Matrix Unit to perform a matrix multiply or a convolution from the Unified Buffer into the Accumulators. A matrix operation takes a variable-sized B*256 input, multiplies it by a 256x256 constant weight input, and produces a B*256 output, taking B pipelined cycles to complete.</p></blockquote><p>This is the instruction that implements the systolic array matrix multiply. It can also perform convolution calculations needed for Convolutional Neural Networks.</p><p><em><strong>Activate</strong></em></p><p>From the paper this instruction</p><blockquote><p>Performs the nonlinear function of the artificial neuron, with options for ReLU, Sigmoid, and so on. Its inputs are the Accumulators, and its output is the Unified Buffer.</p></blockquote><p><span>If we go back to our simple neural network model the values in the hidden layers are the result of applying an ‘activation function’ to the sum of the weights multiplied by the inputs. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)" rel="">ReLU</a><span> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function" rel="">Sigmoid</a><span> are two of the most popular activation functions. Having these implemented in hardware will have provided a useful speed-up in the application of the activation functions.</span></p><p><em><strong>Write_Host_Memory</strong></em></p><p>Writes results to the host computer’s memory from the Unified Buffer over PCIe.</p><p>It’s probably worth pausing for a moment to reflect on the elegance of these five instructions in providing an almost complete implementation of inference in the TPU v1. In pseudo-code, we could describe the operation of the TPU v1 broadly as follows:</p><pre><code>Read_Host_Memory
Read_Weights
Loop_Start
    Matrix_Multiply
    Activate
Loop_End
Write_Host_Memory</code></pre><p>It’s also useful to emphasize the importance of the systolic unit in making this possible and efficient. As described by the TPU v1 team (and as we’ve already seen):</p><blockquote><p>.. the matrix unit uses systolic execution to save energy by reducing reads and writes of the Unified Buffer …. It relies on data from different directions arriving at cells in an array at regular intervals where they are combined. … data flows in from the left, and the weights are loaded from the top. A given 256-element multiply-accumulate operation moves through the matrix as a diagonal wavefront.</p></blockquote><p>The TPU v1’s hardware would be of little use without a software stack to support it. Google developed and used Tensorflow so creating ‘drivers’ so that Tensorflow could work with the TPU v1 was the main step needed.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The TPU software stack had to be compatible with those developed for CPUs and GPUs so that applications could be ported quickly to the TPU. The portion of the application run on the TPU is typically written in TensorFlow and is compiled into an API that can run on GPUs or TPUs.</p><p>Like GPUs, the TPU stack is split into a User Space Driver and a Kernel Driver. The Kernel Driver is lightweight and handles only memory management and interrupts. It is designed for long-term stability. The User Space driver changes frequently. It sets up and controls TPU execution, reformats data into TPU order, translates API calls into TPU instructions, and turns them into an application binary.</p></blockquote><p>As we saw in our earlier post, the TPU v1 was fabricated by TSMC using a relatively ‘mature’ 28nm TSMC process. Google has said that the die area is less than half the die area of the Intel Haswell CPU and Nvidia’s K80 GPU chips, each of which was built with more advanced processes, that Google was using in its data centers at this time.&nbsp;</p><p>We have already seen how simple the TPU v1’s instruction set was, with just 20 CISC instructions. The simplicity of the ISA leads to a very low ‘overhead’ in the TPU v1’s die for decoding and related activities with just 2% of the die area dedicated to what are labeled as ‘control’.</p><p>By contrast, 24% of the die area is dedicated to the Matrix Multiply Unit and 29% to the ‘Unified Buffer’ memory that stores inputs and intermediate results.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd012f995-c456-4400-bfb5-7b7279509335_792x820.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd012f995-c456-4400-bfb5-7b7279509335_792x820.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd012f995-c456-4400-bfb5-7b7279509335_792x820.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd012f995-c456-4400-bfb5-7b7279509335_792x820.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd012f995-c456-4400-bfb5-7b7279509335_792x820.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd012f995-c456-4400-bfb5-7b7279509335_792x820.jpeg" width="792" height="820" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d012f995-c456-4400-bfb5-7b7279509335_792x820.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:820,&quot;width&quot;:792,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:188413,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd012f995-c456-4400-bfb5-7b7279509335_792x820.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd012f995-c456-4400-bfb5-7b7279509335_792x820.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd012f995-c456-4400-bfb5-7b7279509335_792x820.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd012f995-c456-4400-bfb5-7b7279509335_792x820.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>At this point, it’s useful to remind ourselves that the TPU v1 was designed to make inference - that is the use of already trained models in real-world services provided at Google’s scale - more efficient.

        <p>
            Make your app's dark-mode smarter with InvertOrNot. Our API predicts if an image should be inverted for
            optimal
            dark-mode rendering. <br>
            This API is free, and is open source (both the code and the weights of the model are <a href="https://github.com/mattismegevand/invertornot">available</a>).
        </p>

        <p><img src="https://invertornot.com/static/examples.png" width="100%" alt="Example of outputs"></p><h4>Try it out</h4>
        <p>Upload an image to see InvertOrNot what transformation it would apply to it.</p>
        

        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            Despite dark-mode's popularity, images often aren't automatically adapted to fit it.
            The conservative approach is to reduce the brightness of the image, which can degrade it significantly.
            Inverting the image can be a better solution, but it can't be applied to all images (see the poor Queen
            Victoria).<br>
            Using our API you can make your website more pleasant to use in dark-mode, without having to manually adapt
            each image.
        </p>

        <h4>How does it work?</h4>
        <p>The API works by finetuning an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946">EfficientNet</a> model on a custom
            dataset using PyTorch. By using deep learning we are able to
            have a
            much more reliable approach to solve this problem, the only alternative being heuristics.</p>

        <h4>How can I use it?</h4><p>
        Documentation is available <a href="https://invertornot.com/docs/">here</a>. If possible cache or store the results provided by the API
        to avoid unnecessary calls.

        </pre><p>

        If you've never adapted images for dark-mode, here's a quick example of what the CSS can look like:
        </p><ul>
            <li>no inversion: <code>filter: grayscale(50%);</code></li>
            <li>inversion: <code>filter: grayscale(50%) invert(100%) brightness(95%) hue-rotate(180deg);</code></li>
        </ul><p>
        Feel free to tweak these based on your dark mode setup.

        </p><h4>Goal</h4>
        <p>
            InvertOrNot is a public demonstration and proof of concept of using a NN classifier to choose how to
            handle images
            in dark-mode.
        </p>

        <h4>Support</h4>
        <p>
            InvertOrNot offers no warranties or guaranties and is done on a best-effort basis.
            If you need reliable or large-scale inversion APIs, I strongly recommend you download the FLOSS code and
            model and run your own instance. The model is lightweight (16MB) and can be run on a CPU (≈ 100ms using ONNX
            Runtime).
        </p>

        <h4>Side note</h4>
        <p>
            Images may be retained for training purposes. Should you prefer your images not be saved, hosting your own
            instance
            is recommended. Additionally, it's important to note that these images will not be distributed; they are
            solely used
            for training purposes
        </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<meta charset="utf-8">

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Meta charged my credit card $40K for advertising, somehow lost track of the money, and has now suspended our account unless we wire them $40K more.</p>
<hr>
<p>When you’re running a small business, you always hear horror stories from fellow founders about dealing with large platform companies like Meta, Google, Amazon, and Apple. Depending on your business, working with these platforms ranges from “convenient” to “existentially necessary”.</p>
<p>In our case, <a href="https://tidbyt.com/">Tidbyt</a> is a very visual consumer product, making it a great fit for Instagram. Our potential customers are on Instagram and Facebook, so we really have to be there too. In fact, since launch, we’ve paid Meta literal millions of dollars for advertising on these platforms.</p>
<p>Given the size of our account, and the fact that I’m a former Facebook employee, we figured things would be fine — and they more or less have been. Ad performance has declined a bit, but hasn’t it for everyone? It also bothered me that we’ve never been assigned an account manager or given a phone number to call for issues, but that seems to be an extremely standard experience as well.</p>
<p>Once our account got large enough, Meta switched us to monthly invoicing and we continued to have a good working relationship for a couple years. Until…</p>
<h2>Pay by credit card? Sure, why not.</h2>
<p>Some time last year, Meta added the option to pay invoices by credit card. It’s not rocket science, you just click “Pay” in their billing portal and enter your credit card. It gets charged.</p>
<p>We tried the credit card payment option for the first time last month. My card was charged, the invoice state updated to “Processing”. Strangely, the portal didn’t provide a PDF receipt or anything, but Meta’s ad platform is known to be fairly buggy.</p>
<p>A little while later, we got an email from Meta with a vaguely scary message:</p>
<blockquote>Your account is 16 days past due and is at risk of being placed on a collections hold. Payment instructions are included at the bottom of each invoice. If you've recently paid this balance, please send payment remittance advice to <a href="https://tidbyt.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d2a2b3abbfb7bca692b4b0fcb1bdbf"><span data-cfemail="fa8a9b83979f948eba9c98d4999597">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> so we can make sure to credit your account promptly.</blockquote>
<p>Bummer, but probably just a mix up? Checking my card, it had <em>definitely</em> been charged, and the charge had even been finalized. We responded with a screenshot of the Amex statement and once again figured that was it.</p>
<p>But <strong>8 days later</strong>, we got another email from a “collections analyst”, and it became pretty clear that the collections analyst didn’t even realize that credit card payments were possible. They asked for things like an <em>“MT103 document”</em> and <em>“payment advise document”</em>. Those are the kinds of receipts you get when you send a wire transfer from a bank, but obviously we didn’t have them since I paid via credit card through Meta’s own website.</p>
<p>This dance continued about once a week, with a new email from Meta, promises from the analyst to call us by phone (they never did), and a new response from us with the credit card statement. By this point we’d actually even settled the credit card bill with Amex.</p>
<p>The last we’d heard from Meta was a week ago, and I sent over the final PDF transaction statement from Amex.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0426/4768/3235/files/statement_a86b2107-163f-4a47-b11c-d0cb2ab6ddc8_1024x1024.png?v=1711391873"></p>
<p><em>Ironic how the credit card statement includes a link to <a href="http://metacareers.com/">metacareers.com</a> 🙃&nbsp;And nope, that phone number doesn’t go anywhere.</em></p>
<h2>I know people at Meta, right?</h2>
<p>Fearing the worst, I personally started reaching out to alumni and employees at Facebook. Like come on, I worked there for a couple years, y’all know me and we can get this figured out, right? Definitely nepotism, but when the entire business is on the line, I’m willing to pull every available lever.</p>
<p>Sadly the only actionable advice we got was to open a case with Meta’s business support. I did that, and the chat support rep was clearly not able to deal with this kind of issue. The rep gave me a link and asked me to fill out a support form to reach support… but it was the exact same form I’d just filled out to start a chat with <em>them</em>.</p>
<p>When that didn’t work, they asked me to file a bug/feedback report. I filed the bug report, but those reports clearly state “we&nbsp;can't personally&nbsp;respond to everyone”. Totally the wrong channel.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0426/4768/3235/files/bug-report_600x600.png?v=1711391994"></p>
<p>And of course, the support case I originally opened is now closed as “completed”.</p>
<h2>Your Meta ad account has been disabled.</h2>
<p>This morning at 3 AM, we got an email saying that our account has been disabled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Tidbyt, Inc.,</p>
<p>Your Meta ad account was placed on a collections hold for overdue invoices totaling USD 37,216.17.</p>
<p>Your account has been disabled and is currently inactive.</p>
<p>To reactive your credit line, we must receive payment for the past due balance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I responded one more time, and got the same response from the same collections analyst:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We apologize for the inconvenience caused, upon checking from our side we haven't received the payment that you have made via Credit Card. We request you check with your bank side and give me an update on the payment status.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But again, there’s nothing more to check on our end since we paid through Meta’s own portal. When we paid via credit card, Meta’s payment processor charged the card for $37K and would have sent that money to Meta’s bank account.</p>
<p><strong>So Meta is sitting on $37K, but has disabled our account because they can’t seem to be bothered to find it. If we want to reactivate our account, we have to double-pay and directly wire transfer them another $37K. Otherwise we’re dead in the water.</strong></p>
<h2>This kills the business.</h2>
<p>I get the inherent risk of relying on a third-party platform for a large chunk of your business, I really do. It keeps me up at night and we’ve definitely invested in alternatives where possible.</p>
<p>But in a lot of ways, Meta <em>is</em> the marketplace. Running a consumer retail business without an Instagram presence… it’s kind of like trying to build a consumer phone app without working with Apple and Google. Sure, you could try to reinvent the entire ecosystem and marketplace with unlimited time &amp; money, but even Amazon failed when they tried that.</p>
<p>What makes it even worse for us is that we base our manufacturing and inventory on sales forecasts. It’s only been 12 hours since our Instagram and Facebook&nbsp;ad accounts were blipped, but we’re already seeing a drop in traffic and sales. We’ll certainly try to course correct, but it’s going to be very, very difficult.</p>
<h2>“Just do a chargeback.”</h2>
<p>One advantage of having paid with a credit card is that we could dispute the charge with Amex. This is a nuclear option since it has a number of risks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Will we win the dispute?</strong> Once we dispute the charge, the bank has months to investigate and render a final decision. There’s always a chance that they could side with Meta, and then we’d never see that money back. In the meantime we would still have to pay Meta another $37K to reactivate the account.</li>
<li>
<strong>Will Meta permanently close our accounts?</strong> If we file a chargeback, then $37K will immediately be withdrawn by the credit card processor from Meta’s account. I promise you, somebody at Meta is going to notice $40K <em>leaving</em> their account, and I have no idea how they would respond. They could permanently close our ad accounts, suspend our organic accounts, or even suspend our personal accounts. No way to know.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Fire and motion.</h2>
<p>Over 20 years ago, Joel Spolsky wrote a great essay that’s always stuck with me, <em><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/01/06/fire-and-motion/">Fire And Motion</a></em>. In it, he talks about “cover fire”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are moving forward, writing code and fixing bugs constantly, time is on your side. Watch out when your competition fires at you. Do they just want to force you to keep busy reacting to their volleys, so you can’t move forward?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When large platform companies throw us for loops like these, it’s a form of cover fire. Instead of spending the day moving our company forward, I’m instead dealing with this curveball that Meta has thrown at us.</p>
<p>Obviously, there isn’t somebody at Meta who is intentionally trying to make our lives difficult because they see Tidbyt as some sort of strategic threat (lol). But organizations will eventually evolve to reproduce the conditions that favor their continued existence and growth.</p>
<p>When Meta has a payments issue that isn’t anyone’s priority to solve, when Google Cloud decides to deprecate another product with short notice, when Apple throws out new App Store rules… these are all cover fire. Even if the underlying intentions are genuine, the effect is that the rest of us spend more time reacting and less time innovating.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what the answer is, but man, do I really wish I hadn’t tried to pay that invoice with a credit card.</p>

<p><a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/wp-content/files/zenhammer_sec24.pdf">Our work</a> shows that it is possible to <strong>trigger Rowhammer bit flips on DDR4 devices on AMD Zen 2 and Zen 3</strong> <strong>systems</strong> despite deployed TRR mitigations. This result proves that <strong>AMD systems are equally vulnerable to Rowhammer as Intel systems</strong>, which greatly increases the attack surface, considering today’s AMD market share of around 36% on x86 desktop CPUs. This poses a significant risk as DRAM devices in the wild cannot easily be fixed, and previous work showed that Rowhammer attacks are practical, for example,&nbsp;<a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/research/dram/smash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the browser</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/wp-content/files/drammer.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on smartphones</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/wp-content/files/flip-feng-shui_sec16.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">across VMs</a>, and even&nbsp;<a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/wp-content/files/throwhammer_atc18.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over the network</a>. Furthermore, we show that ZenHammer can trigger <strong>Rowhammer bit flips on a DDR5 device for the first time</strong>.</p>



<p>Our results show a high number of bit flips on Zen 2 and Zen 3 systems. Also, devices are more vulnerable on Zen 3 than Coffee Lake, simplifying exploitation. We can build the page table, RSA public key corruption, and sudo exploits from prior work on 7/6/4 of these devices, taking, on average, just 164/267/209 seconds.</p>



<h2>How did you do it?</h2>



<p>We reverse-engineered the <strong>secret DRAM address functions </strong>by adopting the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity16/sec16_paper_pessl.pdf">DRAMA</a> technique for AMD systems. We found that the timing routine must be changed for more reliable results. We make the key observation that a physical offset must be applied to physical addresses before recovering the DRAM address functions due to system address remapping (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>). This allows us to recover the address functions completely. However, using these address functions gives us very few bit flips on 5 and 0 of 10 devices on AMD Zen 2 and Zen 3, respectively, as we show in <strong>Table 1</strong>.</p>

The Top of Memory (TOM) is the system’s highest addressable memory location.</td><td><strong>Table 1:</strong> Result of running Blacksmith on AMD Zen 2 and Zen 3 systems, compared to our Intel Coffee Lake baseline. We report for each device the number of patterns found (|P+|) and the number of bit flips over all patterns (|F_fuzz|). We omit devices without any bit flips.</td></tr><tr><td><img decoding="async" src="https://comsec.ethz.ch/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20240319_141734_ZenHammer-watermarked@2x-1024x495.png" alt=""></td><td><img decoding="async" src="https://comsec.ethz.ch/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20240319_154517_paper@2x-1024x567.png" alt=""></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>We started by looking at the <strong>refresh synchronization</strong>, which previous work (e.g., <a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/research/dram/smash/">SMASH</a>, <a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/research/dram/blacksmith/">Blacksmith</a>) showed to be important for triggering bit flips. We demonstrate that continuous timing measurements using non-repeating rows are effective for precise and reliable refresh synchronization on AMD. The result in<strong> Listing 1</strong> shows our improved refresh synchronization method.</p>

<p>We found out that the <strong>activation rate of non-uniform Rowhammer patterns </strong>on AMD Zen+/3 systems is significantly lower than on Intel Coffee Lake (see <strong>Figure 2</strong>). To investigate this, we conducted a series of experiments to find the optimal hammering <strong>instruction sequence</strong>. Our results showed that regular loads (<code>MOV</code>) with <code>CLFLUSHOPT</code> for flushing aggressors from the cache, issued immediately after accessing an aggressor (“scatter” style), is optimal. It further revealed that, unlike on Zen 2, explicit fencing after flushing is not required on Zen 3.</p>

<p>We further investigated how different <strong>fence types and fence scheduling policies</strong> affect Rowhammer patterns on AMD Zen systems. For this, we came up with six different pattern-aware and cache-avoiding fence scheduling policies (see <strong>Table 2</strong>) and tested them on our devices for 6 hours each to determine the device’s optimal policy. We found that on most devices on Zen 2 the policy SP_none is optimal while SP_pair is in most cases better suited on Zen 3.</p>

<h2>How bad is it?</h2>



<p>For our <strong>evaluation</strong>, we considered a test pool of 10x DDR4 DRAM devices covering the three major manufacturers (Samsung, Micron, SK Hynix). We let our ZenHammer fuzzer run for 3 hours with each fence type (mfence, sfence) and fence scheduling policy. After each run, the best pattern is determined by using a minisweep over 4 MiB with all found patterns. Thereafter, we <em>swept</em> the best pattern of the best policy over a contiguous memory area of 256 MB and reported the number of bit flips. The results in <strong>Table 3</strong> show that our ZenHammer fuzzer is able to trigger bit flips on 7 (Zen 2) and 6 (Zen 3) of 10 DDR4 DRAM devices.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Table 3:</strong> ZenHammer results on AMD Zen 2 and Zen 3 as well as Intel Coffee Lake.

We also show the number of bit flips found when sweeping the best patterns over a 256 MiB range (|F_swp|).</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><img decoding="async" src="https://comsec.ethz.ch/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20240319_144633_paper@2x-1024x447.png" alt=""></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>We evaluated the <strong>exploitability</strong> of these bit flips based on three attacks from <a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/wp-content/files/hammertime_raid18.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous work</a>: (i) an attack targeting the page frame number of a page table entry (PTE) to pivot it to an attacker-controlled page table page, (ii) an attack on the RSA-2048 public key that allows recovering the associated private key used to authenticate to an SSH host, (iii) and an attack on the password verification logic of the <code>sudoers.so</code> library that enables gaining root privileges. We report the results in <strong>Table 4</strong>. </p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Table 4:</strong> Analysis of the bit flip exploitability found during the sweep over 256 MiB on AMD Zen 2, Zen 3, and Intel Coffee Lake.

We omit DIMMs without any exploitable bit flips.</td></tr><tr><td><img decoding="async" src="https://comsec.ethz.ch/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20240319_142711_paper@2x-1024x264.png" alt=""></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>What about DDR5?</h2>



<p>Finally, we tried ZenHammer on DDR5 by reverse engineering the DRAM functions on AMD Zen 4 and evaluating ten DDR5 devices. Out of these ten devices, ZenHammer could trigger ~42k flips on one device. <strong>This is the first public report of DDR5 bit flips on commodity systems in the wild</strong>. However, given that ZenHammer could not trigger flips on nine out of ten devices, we conclude that more research is necessary to find more effective patterns for DDR5 devices.</p>



<h2>Further Information</h2>



<p>For full details and more information about our work, please have a look at our&nbsp;<a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/wp-content/files/zenhammer_sec24.pdf">paper</a>, which is to appear at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/">USENIX Security 2024</a> in August 2024. Our ZenHammer fuzzer is available on <a href="https://github.com/comsec-group/zenhammer">Github</a>.</p>



<h2>FAQs</h2>



<p>Following, we provide answers to the most frequently asked questions about our work.</p>



<p><strong>Why has nobody paid any attention to AMD systems before?</strong><br>We believe that AMD received little attention as the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2678373.2665726">original work</a> on Rowhammer by Kim et al. showed a much higher number of bit flips on Intel systems and subsequent work also focused primarily on Intel. Further, there is much more known about the microarchitecture of Intel CPUs compared to AMD CPUs.</p>



<p><strong>Are there any DDR4 devices that are safe?</strong><br>Not likely. We could not trigger any bit flips on 3 and 4 of our 10 devices on Zen 2 and Zen 3, respectively. However, given that we triggered only a few bit flips on them on Intel Coffee Lake as well, we think that tuning the fuzzer further may expose bit flips on these devices too. </p>



<p><strong>Why does your evaluation consider ten devices only?</strong><br>Because we have a limited number of AMD Zen 2/3 machines in our lab and some of our experiments took a long time, we have decided to reduce the number of devices to ten. We made sure that our randomly chosen subset includes devices from all three major DRAM vendors.</p>



<p><strong>How can I check whether my DRAM is vulnerable?</strong><br>The code of our ZenHammer fuzzer, which you can use to assess your DRAM device for bit flips on AMD Zen 2/3/4 CPUs, is available on&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/comsec-group/zenhammer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Why has JEDEC not fixed this issue yet?</strong><br>By now we know, thanks to a better understanding, that solving Rowhammer is hard but not impossible, as we show in our previous work <a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/research/dram/protrr/">ProTRR</a> and <a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/research/dram/rega/">REGA</a>. We believe that there is a lot of bureaucracy inside JEDEC that makes it difficult to properly address Rowhammer.</p>



<p><strong>What about DIMMs with Error Correction Codes (ECC)?</strong><br><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8835222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Previous work</a>&nbsp;on DDR3 showed that ECC cannot provide protection against Rowhammer. Due to the even larger number of bit flips in current DDR4 devices, we believe that ECC cannot provide complete protection against Rowhammer but just makes exploitation harder.</p>



<p><strong>What if my system runs with a double refresh rate?</strong><br>Besides an increased performance overhead and power consumption, previous work (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mutlu et al.</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9152631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frigo et al.</a>) showed that doubling the refresh rate is a weak solution not providing complete protection.</p>



<h2>Responsible Disclosure</h2>



<p>Rowhammer is a known industry-wide issue, and we did not see a need to go through the typical disclosure process. Nonetheless, we informed AMD on February 26, 2024, and at their request, we did not publicly disclose the issue until March 25, 2024. This page was briefly online by mistake on March 21.</p>

<p dir="auto"><em>We are currently in Public Alpha. We don't recommend using Tracecat for production until Public Beta is out! Nevertheless, we are building remarkably fast and expect to get there in the next 3-4 months.</em></p>
<p dir="auto">There are two "flavors" of Tracecat.
Tracecat Embedded, which runs on a single instance and scales vertically, and Tracecat Distributed, which scales horizontally with self-healing / resillience.
Tracecat Embedded is designed to run automation workflows, store event logs, and run search queries with <em>extreme</em> efficiency on a single instance (e.g. EC2, laptop).</p>
<p dir="auto">Embedded Tracecat should already scale beyond Tines' free tier (3 workflows, 500 workflow runs daily) given sufficient memory, cpu, and network capacity.
With Tracecat on <a href="https://github.com/quickwit-oss/quickwit">Quickwit</a>, you can also store events logs in S3 at unlimited scale and time length.</p>
<p dir="auto">For enterprise use-cases that require 99.99% SLAs, however, we recommend waiting for Tracecat Distributed!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<article id="content">
			<p><a href="#esbuild">esbuild</a> and <a href="#redis">Redis</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> are two examples of codebases with exceptional documentation.</p>
<p>Through their READMEs, changelogs, architecture documents, and code comments, both projects explain their design in such a way that someone new to the codebase can understand where things are, how things are done, and why they are done that way.</p>
<p>If you’re a developer looking to get better at documenting your code and software architecture, these are great case studies.</p>
<h2 id="why-good-documentation-matters">Why good documentation matters</h2>
<p>If you’re writing software, good documentation is a necessity, especially if other people will see or contribute to the codebase—or if you <em>yourself</em> plan on coming back later.</p>
<p>If you’re only using the software, you almost always could benefit from documentation that is missing, whether it be instructions on how to use it—or an explanation of when you should <em>and shouldn’t</em> use it.</p>
<p>If you’re contributing to a codebase, the speed at which you can start effectively contributing is correlated to how good the documentation is, as long as the code itself isn’t convoluted.</p>
<p>Whether you’re an author, contributor, or just an end user of the codebase, the quality of the documentation affects your experience, directly or indirectly—so writing good documentation matters.</p>
<p>The benefits of good documentation are too many to list. Here are a few that might apply to you.</p>
<ul>
<li>You save time, especially if you’re working with a team. Instead of explaining the entire codebase for an hour to each person who joins your project, though that is beneficial itself in a number of ways, they rather read the documentation ahead of time, resulting in a more productive discussion when you do talk, as it’s not a one-sided conversation.</li>
<li>Your open source project is more likely to receive outside contributions and therefore keep existing after you can no longer maintain it.</li>
<li>Past decisions that you’re now questioning have been recorded, preventing you from accidentally reintroducing a problem that a past decision helped to resolve.</li>
<li>More people can use your application or library, because fewer people have to figure things out for themselves.</li>
<li>It helps structure your thinking—and reveal flaws. When writing, you have to explicitly consider and record what you’re thinking, and it brings to light potential problems that you otherwise wouldn’t have noticed.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in mind, let’s look at and learn from two open source projects that have excellent documentation.</p>
<h2 id="esbuild">esbuild</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild">esbuild</a> is a JavaScript bundler created by <a href="https://madebyevan.com/">Evan Wallace</a>. It’s not important for this analysis to know what a bundler is, but <a href="https://webpack.js.org/concepts/why-webpack/">webpack</a> has a good explanation if you’re curious.</p>
<h3 id="esbuilds-readme">esbuild’s README</h3>
<p>A project’s README serves as the entry point for a reader of the code. It’s where they get oriented, so it’s important to not overwhelm them with information. Likewise, it’s important to point them to different areas where they can learn more.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjago.com/great-docs/esbuild-readme.png" alt="The short README for esbuild, with a logo, links, and a brief explanation of why someone would choose it over other bundlers."></p>
<p>This README focuses exclusively on the end user of the tool.</p>
<p>It first links to major sections in the documentation, such as the getting started section, allowing someone to jump to the topic they’re looking for.</p>
<p>The only other section is titled “Why?” and explains briefly why someone would choose this JavaScript bundler over others, with a visualization to help understand the reason. This section also lists the features of the tool, providing an overview of what it does, which helps someone determine if it meets their needs.</p>
<p>And that’s it. Starting from here, someone can explore the FAQ, the getting started pages if they wish to use it, the API documentation, or the documentation for a specific feature. It’s hard to get lost.</p>
<h3 id="esbuilds-architecture-documentation">esbuild’s architecture documentation</h3>
<p>Although the README doesn’t mention the code architecture—its audience is the end user—esbuild is certainly not lacking in architecture documentation.</p>
<p>Inside a directory called <code>docs</code> are two files: <code>architecture.md</code> and <code>development.md</code>. It’s easy to find what you’re looking for. We’ll focus on the first file.</p>
<p>The document starts with a table of contents to help find things and an introduction which explains the intention of the document.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjago.com/great-docs/esbuild-architecture-introduction.png" alt="The table of contents and introductory paragraph of the esbuild architecture documentation."></p>
<p>After the short introduction, it talks about the design principles. This is important because it sets the foundation for the decisions that follow. For anything not explicitly explained in the later parts, we wouldn’t be wrong to assume they are a result of these principles, and can infer the reason for an unexplained design choice.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjago.com/great-docs/esbuild-architecture-design.png" alt="The design principles of the architecture of esbuild."></p>
<p>Another thing done well is that it’s not all text. There are plenty of graphics to help explain concepts. Below, we see a graphic which shows the different phases of how esbuild bundles JavaScript, including an indication of which steps are done in parallel.</p>
<p>Graphs with nodes and edges are useful if the process you’re explaining involves steps that loop back to each other, which can be hard to get across by textual description alone.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjago.com/great-docs/esbuild-architecture-build-pipeline.png" alt="A graphic in the esbuild architecture documentation that explains the different phases of how it bundles JavaScript, including an indication of which steps are done in parallel."></p>
<p>The visuals mix in code as well, such as in the below example which shows the traversal of the program through code during the tree shaking process.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjago.com/great-docs/esbuild-architecture-tree-shaking.png" alt="The section on tree shaking in the esbuild architecture documentation, with a graphic to aid in visualizing a complex concept."></p>
<p>The rest of the architecture documentation for esbuild is similar. It explains a lot in text, but also provides graphics to help visualize complex concepts. Code snippets, tables, and formatting are abundant to aid in reading and understanding how and why things work the way they do.</p>
<h3 id="esbuilds-changelog">esbuild’s changelog</h3>
<p>esbuild’s thorough documentation doesn’t stop at the architecture—it extends to the changelog as well.</p>
<p>This entry in the changelog has a summary, an extended description, and example code showing the output before and after the change.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjago.com/great-docs/esbuild-changelog.png" alt="An entry in the esbuild changelog with a summary, an extended description, and example code with before and after the change."></p>
<p>What’s impressive is that <em>every</em> entry is like this. Detailed explanation<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, example code. Someone reading through the changes can understand the impact without referencing the actual code modifications.</p>
<h3 id="the-result-of-esbuilds-good-documentation">The result of esbuild’s good documentation</h3>
<p>It’s not enough that esbuild is a fast JavaScript bundler to win people over. The detailed documentation has no doubt played a role in its growth. At the time of writing, it has 37,000 stars on GitHub and is used by 4.6 million projects.</p>
<p>Although Evan is the main contributor by far, there is still no doubt that the documentation has helped get the project to where it is today by serving as a form of thinking—it may be the only way to wrangle such a complex system into one’s head.</p>
<h2 id="redis">Redis</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/redis/redis">Redis</a> is an in-memory database. As with esbuild, any more explanation of what Redis does is out of scope for this post, but what is in scope for Redis is the level of detail in the documentation, specifically around its code and architecture.</p>
<h3 id="the-redis-readme-introduction-and-architecture">The Redis README: Introduction and architecture</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/README.md">README</a> shares many of the good characteristics of the esbuild README, with a couple differences.</p>
<p>First, it’s not short, but that’s okay because the section that introduces Redis is short. The rest of the README is for people contributing to or reading the Redis codebase. This README has a focus on both end users and contributors. For esbuild and Redis, what’s important is that the documentation for both end users and contributors is available—it’s just in different locations.</p>
<p>In the section for contributors, the Redis README talks about compiling the Redis source code, fixing common build problems, gotchas with particular operating systems, and running and installing Redis. It covers the basics and highlights common problems, allowing someone to get started and assisting them in not getting stuck soon after.</p>
<p>However, the section which really shines is about the <a href="https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/README.md#redis-internals">Redis internals</a>.</p>
<p>This section begins with the layout of the source code, allowing someone new to understand where to find what they’re looking for, and what directories they might be working in most.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjago.com/great-docs/redis-source-code-layout.png" alt="A section in the Redis README that talks about the layout of the source code."></p>
<p>Then, it talks about key files and their structure. This helps someone understand where the control flow starts.</p>
<p>Further down it continues to go over key files, building up an architecture of the program.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjago.com/great-docs/redis-server-h.png" alt="A section in the Redis README that explains the server.h file, which is the main header file where its data structures are defined."></p>
<p>Unlike esbuild, the description of the architecture is more compact, yet it’s still wonderful to have, as the other option is to read through hundreds of source code files, some with thousands of lines.</p>

<p>Any well-documented codebase usually has good inline documentation in the form of code comments.</p>
<p>In the Redis codebase, we see examples like the one below, where multiple paragraphs explain a single line of code, providing valuable context.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjago.com/great-docs/redis-detailed-code-comment.png" alt="An example of a detailed code comment in the Redis source code, with a paragraph explaining a single line to provide full context."></p>
<p>It’s important to emphasize that long explanations of trivial lines of code are not necessary. If the operation is simple and doesn’t require additional context to understand why it’s done that way, then it’s better to have no comment. A comment which says the same thing as the line of code is unnecessary, unless the line of code is particularly difficult to read (in which case it should probably be refactored), or the intention is to teach.</p>
<p>Below we see an example of this, where the line that may be questioned with “why the assertion?” is explained with a comment which assures the reader why it should be correct to assert this.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjago.com/great-docs/redis-necessary-code-comment.png" alt="A function in the Redis source code where it makes an assertion that might be questioned. The line with the assertion has a comment explaining why the assertion should be correct."></p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>There are many open source projects with great documentation. I decided to showcase these two because I vividly remember that when I first came across them, I thought to myself, “wow, this is some good documentation.”</p>
<p>Although time constraints in the moment may not allow for such thorough documentation, what’s hard to see is how much time it saves later on, not just for yourself but for others. Keep that in mind when making the tradeoff.</p>
<p>Some projects are purely for fun, or something that only you are working on and you’re not sure if it’s going to go anywhere. In these situations, it’s okay to not document anything.</p>
<p>But not documenting anything on a project that many people use or contribute to is something you may want to reconsider.</p>

<p>A Wharton professor who studies AI, innovation, and start-ups dramatically claims that "the modern economy rests on a single road in Spruce Pine, North Carolina." Ethan Mollick explains that this unremarkable road leads to a Sibelco North America Inc. facility where ultra-high-purity quartz is mined. This location is vitally important as it is claimed to be "the sole supplier of the quartz required to make the crucibles needed to refine silicon wafers."</p><div><blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The modern economy rests on a single road in Spruce Pine, North Carolina.

It is the world’s leading high-purity quartz (HPQ) provider, and the firm claims it produces “the world’s highest quality quartz” at this mine.</p><p>Geologically speaking, the uniquely pure minerals at Spruce Mine were created about 380 million years ago when Africa collided with North America. This momentous collision, however slow, caused intense friction and heat miles below the Earth’s surface. According to Sibelco, the Spruce Mine minerals were created by a rich mineral-forming liquid that cooled and crystallized over time. A standout feature of these minerals is that they were made in their purest forms due to a lack of water, which caused all the friction.</p><p>In more recent history, it is claimed that the Spruce Pine site has been mined for centuries, with Native American peoples known to have mined Mica. In addition to Mica and the headlining HPQ, the mine is a rich source of kaolin and feldspar.</p><p>Spruce pine-sourced minerals were first used for electronics by Thomas Edison, who used Mica as an insulator in some of his inventions as far back as 1879.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-tgmzAe3UX4gfPUe4hnfqd5"><section><p>Join the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC tech news — and have for over 25 years.

OpenAPI AutoSpec is a local server proxy that generates new OpenAPI specifications from network requests. When running, it will connect your local HTTP traffic to the proxy. Once that happens, it will automatically convert network traffic into the specification.
<p dir="auto"><em>Features</em>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Generate OpenAPI 3.0 specifications automatically for any local website or application</li>
<li>Capture and document new requests &amp; responses, including headers, bodies, and query parameters</li>
<li>Review generated specifications in real-time on your terminal and download them with ease</li>
<li>Export your OpenAPI file for sharing</li>
<li>Ignores static file URLs: .js, .css, .svg, .png, .jpeg, .ico.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is a <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" rel="nofollow">Node.js</a> module available through the
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" rel="nofollow">npm registry</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Before installing, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" rel="nofollow">download and install Node.js</a>.
Node.js 0.10 or higher is required.</p>
<p dir="auto">Installation steps:
<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally" rel="nofollow"><code>npm install</code> command</a>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ npm install openapi-autospec"><pre>$ <span>npm install openapi-autospec</span></pre></div>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Start the server, it generates a link for you to use, and then use the new link from the proxy server to catch traffic on a target server. To generate the document you want: visit pages, fill out forms/all the fields or data you wish to track, and perform the actions you want to document from your APIs. For more information on getting documentation from a full-stack server versus both frontend and backend servers - <a href="#readme-misc">use this reference</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">To start the server:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ npx autospec --portTo PORT --portFrom PORT --filePath openapi.json"><pre>$ <span>npx autospec --portTo PORT --portFrom PORT --filePath openapi.json</span></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>--portTo choose the port your localhost webserver is running from.</li>
<li>--portFrom (optional) is for if another port is in use.</li>
<li>--filePath is where you would like to export the spec.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Once the server is running, it will automatically begin documenting the API behavior of your local web applications. The documentation process is based on the network requests observed, so you don't need to do any crazy setup within your applications beyond the below.
<p dir="auto">The server provides real-time printouts of the generated OpenAPI specifications. From here:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Fill out all fields you wish to be documented for forms</li>
<li>Export the OpenAPI specification for external use or sharing (exports where you are in the terminal if you don't specify the --filePath flag)</li>
<li>You should find and replace all instances of ‘localhost’ or ‘127.0.0.1:8000’ in the exported doc with your actual website</li>
<li>Filter hosts and parameterize paths to fine-tune the documentation properly for server stubs</li>
<li>Restart the documentation process at any time to refresh the generated specifications</li>
</ul>

<p>The EU has today announced that it is not satisfied that Apple’s <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">App Store</a> changes comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), and the company is now officially under investigation for non-compliance.</p>



<p>If that investigation confirms that <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/aapl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a> failed to comply with the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/antitrust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">antitrust</a> law, then the iPhone maker could be fined up to 10% of its worldwide turnover – increasing to 20% for repeat infringements …</p>



<h2 id="h-the-story-so-far">The story so far</h2>



<p>The DMA requires tech giants to ensure that they are not using a dominant market position to give their own products and services an unfair advantage over competing ones.</p>



<p>The first step in the process was to decide which companies qualified as “gatekeepers” under the law – that is, companies whose power was enough to effectively harm competitors. Apple was found to be a gatekeeper in terms of the App Store, as there was no other way for a developer to sell iPhone apps. That meant the company was obliged to make policy changes to comply with the DMA.</p>



<p>Apple announced that <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/third-party-iphone-app-stores-ios-17-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it would allow third-party app stores</a>, but with a mass of asterisks. These included charging a Core Technology Fee for any app sold outside of its own App Store, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/18/app-store-core-technology-fee-dma-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which could potentially bankrupt small developers</a>.</p>



<p>We said at the time that <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/26/apples-third-party-app-store-announcements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">these proposals were not going to satisfy the EU</a>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Apple has bought itself some time here for sure – in part, because what it has come up with is so complicated it will take regulators some time to digest all the details and run all the numbers.</p>



<p>But there seems little doubt that Apple is aiming to do everything it can to make leaving the App Store as difficult and expensive as possible.</p>



<p>Once all the dust has settled, it seems pretty clear that regulators are&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;going to consider what Apple has done as DMA compliant.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-app-store-changes-investigated-for-non-compliance">App Store changes investigated for non-compliance</h2>



<p>As we predicted, the EU has today <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_1689" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it is not satisfied with the changes Apple has made, and the company is now subject to a non-compliance investigation. Google and Meta are also under investigation for their own responses to the DMA.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Today, the Commission has opened non-compliance investigations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) into Alphabet’s rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing on Google Search, Apple’s rules on steering in the App Store and the choice screen for Safari and Meta’s “pay or consent model”.</p>



<p>The Commission suspects that the measures put in place by these gatekeepers fall short of effective compliance of their obligations under the DMA.</p>



<p>In addition, the Commission has launched investigatory steps relating to Apple’s new fee structure for alternative app stores […] Apple’s new fee structure and other terms and conditions for alternative app stores and distribution of apps from the web (sideloading) may be defeating the purpose of its obligations under Article 6(4) of the DMA.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-safari-choice-screen-also-under-investigation">Safari choice screen also under investigation</h2>



<p>Another DMA requirement was for Apple to ensure that iPhone users had a free choice of web browser. The company announced that it would make this possible with <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/third-party-default-browsers-engines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new option screen during iPhone setup</a>. </p>



<p>This has now been implemented, and seems to be <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/13/brave-browser-iphone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">having at least some small effect</a>. However, the EU is not satisfied with the specifics of this – which may simply be down to the wording used. This one is likely to be easily resolved.</p>



<h2 id="h-maximum-fine-is-10-of-total-worldwide-turnover">Maximum fine is 10% of total worldwide turnover</h2>



<p>The maximum fines allowed under many laws are trivial for a company of Apple’s size – but this is <em>not</em> the case with the DMA.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In case of an infringement, the Commission can impose fines up to 10% of the company’s total worldwide turnover. Such fines can go up to 20% in case of repeated infringement.</p>
</blockquote>




	<p>Apple’s 2023 turnover was $383B, which could mean fines of up to $38 billion initially, rising to $76 billion.</p>



<h2 id="h-investigation-aims-to-complete-in-less-than-a-year">Investigation aims to complete in less than a year</h2>



<p>Such investigations take time, but in this case the stated goal is to complete it in less than a year – which is lightning speed by the usual standard.</p>



<p>That won’t be the end of matters, however. If the EU does find Apple non-compliant, the Cupertino company will appeal the ruling, and we will then be set for literally years of court battles as the case works its way up the court hierarchy.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="container"><article><p>Eric Ghost's cleverly disguised LSD packaging mirrored the 1960s counterculture's psychedelic vision.</p><figure><img width="700" height="420" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lsd-lead-700x420.jpg" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high"></figure><p>The image that follows is not of actual Kodak film but rather of a clever and gently satiric stealth packaging for underground LSD made by the New Yorker Eric Ghost — aka Eric Brown — in 1968. Ghost first took LSD in the Lower East Side around 1965, after a peripatetic life of military service, armed robbery, and prison. He swallowed nearly 4,000 micrograms, or mics, of pure Sandoz, smeared across a sugar cube, and the thermonuclear revelation occasioned by this enormous dose convinced him to co-found the Psychedelicatessen, a legendary though short-lived head shop that opened on 164 Avenue A in 1966. Like many acid people at the time, Ghost was messianic about the molecule and its potential to improve people and the world. Once LSD was banned, he decided to start cooking and distributing the material himself.</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="1295" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/kodak.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>In contrast to today, when psychedelics are imagined to be medicines, party favors, or indigenous sacraments, many LSD users in the 1960s imagined their favorite substance as a kind of media. Like the increasingly technological media of the postwar world, LSD filters, transforms, and amplifies non-drug phenomena. Ghost played with this association by disguising his acid as film stock promising “brilliant color.” Each sheet was wrapped inside mylar, which not only protected the acid from damaging UV light, but also discouraged suspicious parties from opening the package on a whim, potentially destroying unexposed film. This “medium is the message” idea permeated acid discourse and marketing. Other examples include “Window pane,” “Clearlist,” and some of the first printed LSD blotters, which featured electric light bulbs.</p><div><figure><img decoding="async" width="787" height="242" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/100-exposures.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="100" height="100" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/arrow.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>Ghost’s stealth packaging contained a novel and significant development in LSD distribution: the first mechanically produced examples of blotter paper dosed with drops of LSD. Liquid LSD had been placed on actual blotting paper and other paper products before, but these transfers would occur one drop at a time, using a pipette or eye-dropper. Ghost and a colleague accelerated this process by designing and building the Mark I, a device that allowed 100 pins to be dipped simultaneously into a pan of LSD in solution, and then moved as a single unit and impressed simultaneously onto a single absorbent piece of paper. The pins, and the dosed paper that resulted, followed a compact grid, which took the form of five tight rows of 20 columns each — the “5-20” pattern slyly referred to above. Each one of the Ghost’s drops contained a hefty 1,000 mics of LSD, which were left to the distributor or client to manually cut into four smaller hits, each packing a still solid 250 mic punch. This arrangement — the “four-way” — would recur throughout the history of blotter.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="922" height="566" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Historic-Factors.jpg" alt=""></figure><div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="100" height="100" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/arrow.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>Opening Ghost’s package, purchasers would discover a handy information sheet that today gives us a sense of how some underground purveyors understood and promoted their wares. Rather than hippie mysticism or revolutionary cant, Ghost’s text presents LSD as a scientific product of a modern research lab run by a pharmaceutical corporation. Though LSD was related to an organic material — the ergot fungus on rye — part of the drug’s curious profile emerged from its origins at the heart of European technological modernity. Though some of Ghost’s information is off (LSD is not chemically similar to mescaline), it demonstrates the nerdy fascination that was always part of modern psychedelic culture.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="869" height="306" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/psychological-effect.jpg" alt=""></figure><div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="100" height="100" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/arrow.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>The most dominant and consistent idea in postwar psychedelic culture and research, still widely used today, is the role of “set and setting” in influencing the experience. Though trumpeted by Timothy Leary and his co-authors in the 1964 book “The Psychedelic Experience,” the notion that LSD reflects and amplifies internal attitudes and environment cues had been recognized by researchers and users in the 1950s. This recursive effect helps explain the wide variety and plasticity of psychedelic effects, as well as the importance of the cultural stories that surround these compounds — expanded consciousness in the 1960s; cluster headaches and PTSD today. Even in those hedonistic and experimental eras, though, the important role of the guide was recognized.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="876" height="272" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/research.jpg" alt=""></figure><div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="100" height="100" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/arrow.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>Today’s clinical and therapeutic promoters of the “psychedelic renaissance” often present themselves as novel pioneers. Ghost’s text reminds us that the 1960s research community had already explored many clinical applications of LSD — for alcoholism, pain and anxiety among cancer patients, psychological repression, and even the challenges of autism. At the same time, the mention of LSD as a possible “cure” for homosexuality — something that was explored earlier in the 1960s by Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert, who later embraced his gay identity — reminds us of the distortion inherent in such research agendas, as well as LSD’s darker legacy as an agent of behavioral modification.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Erik Davis</strong> is a scholar, award-winning journalist, and speaker whose writing has ranged from rock criticism to media studies to creative explorations of esoteric mysticism.

Here, amid yellowed books, historical maps and medieval manuscripts, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/martinscorsese" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Martin Scorsese</a> has quietly made public a very private preoccupation. More than 50 storage boxes hold thousands of VHS tapes that contain films and television programs Scorsese recorded directly from broadcast television. The renowned director and film preservationist, it turns out, was also, for decades, a prolific guerrilla archivist.</p><figure id="4bbd34df-3853-4a2e-89d5-681083bb56e3" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:1,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;‘Sin is fun!’ Martin Scorsese on brutality, love – and his rebirth on TikTok &quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;4bbd34df-3853-4a2e-89d5-681083bb56e3&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/12/martin-scorsese-brutality-love-rebirth-tiktok&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:2,&quot;theme&quot;:3,&quot;design&quot;:10}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false}"></gu-island></figure><p>Long before YouTube and Netflix gave the world instant access to a deep repository of media, Scorsese began the project of amassing his own private on-demand video library. In each week’s TV Guide, he would note the movies and shows that caught his interest. A full-time video archivist in Scorsese’s New York office would then record the telecasts from a kind of audiovisual hub made up of multiple VCRs and monitors, which could often be active at all hours. The tapes were meticulously labeled, cataloged initially using a library-like card system and later a computer, and filed away for Scorsese’s personal viewing and research.</p><p>Spanning the 1980s through the 2000s, the <a href="https://archives.colorado.edu/repositories/2/resources/1887" data-link-name="in body link">Martin Scorsese VHS Tape Collection</a> contains more than 4,400 distinct titles, including features, documentaries, shorts, history programs and award shows. Perusing the online catalogue, you’ll find everything from European arthouse masterpieces to an episode of Live with Regis and Kathie Lee featuring Scorsese’s beloved mother, Catherine, who made regular cameos in her son’s films. As the archive steadily grew, Scorsese made the videos an essential part of his film-making process. Typically during pre-production, he would ask his archivist to pull tapes of various films, many of which were not otherwise available on home video. He would then hand out the tapes to the cast and crew to serve as reference materials.</p><figure id="85718555-90e2-4e0f-9dad-7c1f652bc76c" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54e1471d2f7e45b807bb572fcfcd648ddb0cb395/0_0_4032_3024/master/4032.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54e1471d2f7e45b807bb572fcfcd648ddb0cb395/0_0_4032_3024/master/4032.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54e1471d2f7e45b807bb572fcfcd648ddb0cb395/0_0_4032_3024/master/4032.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54e1471d2f7e45b807bb572fcfcd648ddb0cb395/0_0_4032_3024/master/4032.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54e1471d2f7e45b807bb572fcfcd648ddb0cb395/0_0_4032_3024/master/4032.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54e1471d2f7e45b807bb572fcfcd648ddb0cb395/0_0_4032_3024/master/4032.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54e1471d2f7e45b807bb572fcfcd648ddb0cb395/0_0_4032_3024/master/4032.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54e1471d2f7e45b807bb572fcfcd648ddb0cb395/0_0_4032_3024/master/4032.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54e1471d2f7e45b807bb572fcfcd648ddb0cb395/0_0_4032_3024/master/4032.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54e1471d2f7e45b807bb572fcfcd648ddb0cb395/0_0_4032_3024/master/4032.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Scorsese VHS archive" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54e1471d2f7e45b807bb572fcfcd648ddb0cb395/0_0_4032_3024/master/4032.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="333.75" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span> Photograph: Megan Friedel</figcaption></figure><p>“I do that on most of my pictures,” Scorsese said in a <a href="https://airmail.news/issues/2023-8-12/after-hours-the-oral-history-of-a-cult-classic" data-link-name="in body link">written interview</a>. “For the actors, it’s usually about tone, mood, a certain emotional state, a suggestion of the world we’re working to create. With crew members, it’s often a cut, a camera movement at a specific point in the story, a certain way of framing. Not copying anything, but suggesting a way of approaching the question of how we’re going to tell the story.”</p><p>The collection is also a physical manifestation of his famously omnivorous appetite for visual media. Scorsese has frequently spoken about growing up asthmatic in a New York City household that lacked books but was one of the first on the block to get a television set in 1948, when he was six years old. For young Marty, who wasn’t able to play in the streets as frequently or vigorously as other kids, the 16-inch screen of the black-and-white RCA Victor in the living room became his window to the world – and, critically, his first exposure to great cinema.</p><p>On Friday nights, a New York station would show Italian neorealist films, and he would sometimes watch them in the company of family members who had immigrated from Sicily; he was struck, particularly, by the work of Roberto Rossellini, which he would later explore in his 1999 documentary My Voyage to Italy. In the mid-to late ’50s, Scorsese’s eyes were peeled to Million Dollar Movie, a program that showed the same film twice a day during weekdays and three times a day on weekends, allowing him, on multiple viewings, to begin thinking about how a movie like Citizen Kane was crafted – the movement of the camera, the use of music, the employment of effects such as slow motion. From grade school through his NYU days, Scorsese would do his homework as images from a muted TV flickered in front of him; much later, he brought the habit into the editing room while cutting his own films with his longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker. He has admitted to feeling a sense of loneliness outside the presence of a television.</p><figure id="d6bcb596-44f1-481b-8ebe-661d8a56ebd0" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d800e4e26a062669ba26b122616592717c42c8f/118_40_2468_1481/master/2468.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d800e4e26a062669ba26b122616592717c42c8f/118_40_2468_1481/master/2468.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d800e4e26a062669ba26b122616592717c42c8f/118_40_2468_1481/master/2468.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d800e4e26a062669ba26b122616592717c42c8f/118_40_2468_1481/master/2468.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d800e4e26a062669ba26b122616592717c42c8f/118_40_2468_1481/master/2468.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d800e4e26a062669ba26b122616592717c42c8f/118_40_2468_1481/master/2468.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro on the set of Raging Bull in 1980" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d800e4e26a062669ba26b122616592717c42c8f/118_40_2468_1481/master/2468.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267.0360615883306" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro on the set of Raging Bull in 1980.</span> Photograph: Ronald Grant</figcaption></figure><p>“He was always voraciously watching, absorbing, learning,” said Paul Mougey, who was an NYU film student when he became Scorsese’s video archivist for four years in the mid- to late ’80s. Shortly thereafter, in 1990, Scorsese formed the non-profit Film Foundation, which has since helped to restore more than 1,000 films. “Marty wanted to get every movie there ever was, and we recorded <em>everything</em>,” Mougey says. “He felt part of his mission as a preservationist was to create this amazing library – and share it with his friends.”</p><p>Mougey fondly recalls the day at Scorsese’s office, then located in New York’s historic Brill Building, when “Bobby” De Niro turned up in boat shoes to pick up a VHS tape containing a film Scorsese wanted him to see before they began shooting Goodfellas. “I just remember thinking he was such a relaxed dude. Very quiet, very polite, very nice,” says Mougey, who landed a cameo as Terrorized Waiter in the 1990 gangster classic. One of Mougey’s successors, Kent Jones, would rise from video archivist to regular Scorsese collaborator, including co-writing A Life of Jesus, which is slated to be Scorsese’s follow-up to last year’s Killers of the Flower Moon.</p><p>Several years ago, Scorsese began slowly donating the VHS collection. The wide availability of high-resolution DVD and Blu-Ray, as well as the rise of streaming, had diminished the usefulness of much of the hulking tape archive. Scorsese’s longtime film archivist, Mark McElhatten, and Scorsese’s final video archivist, Gina Telaroli, were friends of Erin Espelie, an associate professor of film at the University of Colorado Boulder. They collaborated to facilitate the university’s acquisition of the collection. In 2021, the final boxes of tapes arrived in Boulder from Scorsese’s Sikelia Productions office in Manhattan.</p><p>The University of Colorado Boulder might seem a curious home for Scorsese’s collection. The 81-year-old is cinema’s foremost chronicler of New York life. He is a New York University alum and onetime teacher at NYU’s undergraduate film-making program. In 2021, NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts established the Martin Scorsese Institute of Global Cinematic Arts, which encompasses both a production center and cinema studies department that bear his name. Still, the Rare and Distinctive Collections in Boulder has positioned itself as a center for scholarship on the history of film and video. It houses significant collections from the influential experimental film-makers Stan Brakhage and Ken and Flo Jacobs.</p><p>“Ultimately, I believe Scorsese honored the experimental film roots of the University of Colorado Boulder and respected our interest in intertwining archival work with teaching,” Espelie said via email. “Our hope in the Department of Cinema Studies and Moving Image Arts is that students, scholars, and community members will come to the Scorsese VHS archive for various purposes: to learn more about how Scorsese relied on the work of others to inform his film-making practice; how Scorsese was a voracious viewer; what movies and programs he watched (and then often shared with cast members); and, from a more documentary perspective, what was playing on television.”</p><figure id="edaea54d-3b59-4d92-b707-76abbdf31803" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb0b8f1a6a5d57f79f9def5f1a180ed0f3e2af58/0_1814_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb0b8f1a6a5d57f79f9def5f1a180ed0f3e2af58/0_1814_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb0b8f1a6a5d57f79f9def5f1a180ed0f3e2af58/0_1814_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb0b8f1a6a5d57f79f9def5f1a180ed0f3e2af58/0_1814_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb0b8f1a6a5d57f79f9def5f1a180ed0f3e2af58/0_1814_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb0b8f1a6a5d57f79f9def5f1a180ed0f3e2af58/0_1814_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Scorsese VHS archive" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb0b8f1a6a5d57f79f9def5f1a180ed0f3e2af58/0_1814_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="266.94113756613757" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span> Photograph: Megan Friedel</figcaption></figure><p>The broadcast recordings include commercials, bumpers and other marginalia, which Espelie said “are as fascinating, in some cases, as the originally desired main recording events. Because of the way television lacked backups, these VHS tapes may provide some of the only copies of these ‘interstitial’ materials.”</p><p>For the archivists at the Rare and Distinctive Collections, the most pressing issue at the moment is the preservation of the Scorsese collection. Magnetic media degrades as it ages. It is believed that a VHS tape begins to progressively lose image quality after only 10 years. Some of Scorsese’s tapes are more than 40 years old. And so the entire archive must be digitized – a major undertaking. Converting thousands of hours of analog recordings is slow, tedious work. For the moment, the university requires the person requesting materials to pay for the digitization of any tape that hasn’t already been converted.</p><p>Once the collection is readily accessible, the University of Colorado Boulder associate film professor Tiel Lundy expects researchers to begin conducting comparative analyses, pinpointing what Scorsese was watching at a given time and how that media may have informed the work he went on to create. “This could be a tremendous book project,” she said.</p><p>Upon being informed of the existence of the Scorsese trove, John Klacsmann, an archivist at Anthology Film Archives in New York, immediately became intrigued by the notion that the director may have captured some true rarities on tape. “I’m certain there are some very rare and interesting copies of films, television broadcasts, and director’s cuts within this collection: deep cuts and obscurities that may have never been released on videotape, commercially or otherwise,” he said via email. “What kind of 1980s viewing list led to cinematic masterpieces like The King of Comedy and The Last Temptation of Christ? I’m certainly curious to know.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>More than 60 percent of Ohio’s driver’s license suspensions do not stem from bad driving; instead, they arise because the driver owes an unpaid debt. Debt-related suspensions (DRS) could prevent people from getting to work where they could make the money needed to repay the debt. In this report, we investigate whether DRS has implications for Ohio’s labor force.</p>    </div>






    </div><div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Most driver’s license suspensions in Ohio do not stem from reasons relating to being a bad driver. In fact, over 60 percent of Ohio’s driver’s license suspensions arise because the driver owes a debt that has not been paid. We label these debt-related suspensions (DRS).</p>
<p>According to a report by the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland, in an average year, over 1.7 million Ohio drivers have over 3.2 million active debt-related suspensions, indicating that drivers often face more than one DRS at a time. While DRS are over-represented in Ohio’s central cities, DRS are a problem throughout the state—60 percent of all suspensions are on drivers <em>outside</em> of Ohio’s central cities. The financial implications of DRS are substantial. From 2016 through 2020, the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) and third-party creditors levied an average of about $150 million in charges and fees related to DRS, but drivers only paid about $33 million per year during that period. The unpaid amount accumulates over time, averaging about $922 million during those five years.<span><a id="cf-fn-ret-1" href="#cf-fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a></span> Furthermore, DRS are much more frequently found in high poverty and minority communities.</p>
<p>Individuals with a DRS are not legally allowed to drive anywhere, even to work. This could prevent people from getting to the place where they could make the money needed to repay the debt and have their license reinstated. It also could prevent them from getting a new job that requires a driver’s license.</p>
<p>In this report, we investigate whether DRS has implications for Ohio’s labor force. However, accurately estimating those implications is quite difficult based upon the available data. Instead, we provide labor market context for DRS on two dimensions. First, we use two hypothetical scenarios based on the share of people in the labor force that comply with DRS or not to illustrate risks of DRS. Second, we investigate how often a valid driver’s license is requested by employers in online job postings.</p>
<h3>Key findings:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>DRS have the potential to significantly impact Ohio’s labor force. For example, if just half of those with a DRS were to comply, the impact statewide could result in a potential loss of over 830,000 working or work-seeking individuals from the labor force.</li>
    <li>The share of jobs ads requesting a driver’s license in Ohio (14.0 percent) is higher than the national average (10.6 percent) in 2022 and has increased 10 percent faster than the national average from 2015 to 2022.</li>
    <li>The share of job ads requesting a driver’s license varies significantly by industry and by geography, indicating that some portions of Ohio’s economy have the potential to be more impacted by DRS than others. For instance, the percent of jobs requiring a driver’s license increases as you move from core urban areas to the metropolitan fringe and is highest in nonmetropolitan Ohio.</li>
    <li>Lower- and middle-wage occupations tend to have the highest rates of job ads requesting a driver’s license. This indicates that DRS can be more problematic for hiring into middle- and lower-wage occupations and suggests that a driver’s license is important for one’s economic mobility in the lower half of the wage distribution.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The DRS data were obtained via a public records request to the Ohio BMV. We obtained a count of all driver’s license suspensions, as well as detailed financial information about eight types of suspensions that we determined to be debt related. The data were aggregated and provided at the zip code level for the years 2016–2020. To analyze the DRS data relative to Ohio population, demographic, and employment data, we matched the DRS zip codes to the Census Bureau equivalent: Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs).</p>
<p>In addition, this analysis uses data on Ohio’s labor force, industrial composition, and occupations from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Information on Ohio’s job ads comes from Lightcast and is aggregated to produce annual estimates of the share of job ads asking for a driver’s license.<span><a id="cf-fn-ret-2" href="#cf-fn-2"><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>
<h3>Two Hypothetical Labor Force Scenarios</h3>
<p>Resulting in over 1.7 million licenses suspended annually, DRS have the potential to significantly impact Ohio’s labor force. However, the available data is lacking a few key inputs to precisely estimate those impacts. At the most basic level, for those receiving a DRS, we do not know if they were employed, if they were looking for work, how likely they were to disregard the suspension and keep driving, if they could get to work without driving, and the length of suspension. Given these limitations, we use labor market information to conduct two hypothetical scenarios to illustrate the risks of DRS to Ohio’s labor force. Each scenario is based on upon the share of the labor force that is subject to a binding DRS shock, in which they abide by the suspension and cannot get to or look for work, so they end up leaving the labor force. As mentioned above, we do not know how likely someone is to abide by the suspension and not drive, so we present a scenario in which half of those receiving a DRS comply with the suspension and another scenario in which all of those receiving a DRS comply with the suspension.</p>
<p>To help introduce these scenarios, let us first consider the share of the labor force that is at risk of a DRS in this framework. In 2020, the 1.66 million DRS would equate to 28.9 percent of Ohio’s labor force at risk of receiving a DRS (Table 1). Accordingly, it is probably best to consider the estimates in Table 1 and the two scenario tables (Tables 2 &amp; 3) to be upper bounds for percent of labor force at risk as it is possible that not all those with a DRS are in the labor force or require driving to the workplace. Relatedly, while each scenario as presented refers to the potential labor force declines from a binding DRS, one could just as easily examine potential gains from removing a hypothetical binding DRS policy that is keeping 1.66 million Ohioans out of the labor force. Furthermore, the labor force impacts are more likely to touch those in poor and nonwhite communities as they are more likely to have received a DRS.</p>

<p>In the first scenario, half of the DRS are binding, which means that half of those receiving a DRS comply with the suspension, and they end up leaving the labor force because they are unable to get to or look for work without a driver’s license. In this scenario, 830,000 workers (14.4 percent) end up leaving the labor force, effectively lowering the labor force participation rate by almost 9 percentage points, from 61.6 percent to 52.7 percent (Table 2). Based upon these numbers, there are potentially significant labor force impacts if only half of those receiving a DRS comply with the suspension.</p>

<p>In the more severe second scenario, all those receiving a DRS comply with the suspension. Under this scenario, almost a third of the labor force is impacted by a DRS and leave the labor force, lowering the labor force participation rate by 18 percentage points to 43.7 percent (Table 3). The potential impacts from this scenario would cause a significant slowdown in economic activity as roughly only two out of every five working age Ohioans would be in the labor force.</p>

<p>Because DRS are not evenly distributed throughout the state, neither would be the withdrawals from the labor force due to DRS. Figure 1 shows the geographic implications of Scenario 1 where half of all individuals with a DRS would leave the labor force.</p>        </div></div>]]></description>

        <p dir="auto">It's been a long time since the last SPQR release, and a lot of work has been done. Here's a brief review of what we've been working on.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>SPQR 2.0 news <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="6096868" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/pg-sharding/spqr/discussions/431" data-hovercard-type="discussion" data-hovercard-url="/pg-sharding/spqr/discussions/431/hovercard" href="https://github.com/pg-sharding/spqr/discussions/431">#431</a></strong><br>
In this release, we add new syntax to handle sharding configuration. To make all things work, you should create a distribution via <code>CREATE DISTRIBUTION</code> command. The next step is to specify a list of tables and columns via <code>ATTACH RELATION</code> command. At the end specify a list of ranges: which values to route to which shard via <code>CREATE KEY RANGE</code> command.  You can see an example at <a href="https://github.com/pg-sharding/spqr/blob/master/docs/Syntax.md">Syntax.md</a>. <code>SHARDING RULE</code> syntax is deprecated now.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Extended Protocol improvements</strong><br>
We continue to work on the extended protocol support in SPQR. A lot of work has already been done, and in most cases, the router works correctly.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shards [re]balancing news</strong><br>
The essential part of our solution is smart shard rebalancing. We made the first version of this component (again). Data migration between shards aims to balance the workload across shards proportionally. The main idea is to minimize any locking impact during these migrations, which is accomplished by reducing the size of the data ranges being transferred.</p>
<p dir="auto">We still have a lot of room for improvement. The full list of changes can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/pg-sharding/spqr/releases/tag/1.3.0">release notes</a>. Stay tuned!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I worked for a few years in the intersection between data science and software
engineering. On the whole, it was a really enjoyable time and I'd like to have
the chance to do so again at some point. One of the least enjoyable experiences
from that time was to deal with big CSV exports. Unfortunately, this file format
is still very common in the data science space. It is easy to understand why --
it seems to be ubiquitous, present everywhere, it's human-readable, it's less
verbose than options like JSON and XML, it's super easy to produce from almost
any tool. What's not to like?</p>
<h2>CSV is (usually) underspecified</h2>
<p>Sure, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180">RFC4180</a> <em>exists</em>, but in
practice, CSV is actually a family of file formats that have been in use since
the early 1970s. If a file has a <code>.csv</code>-suffix, you don't actually have all of
the information that you require in order to parse it correctly, it's severely
underspecified and in practice, you'll need to open the file and look at it
in order to load the data into a programming environment. Here are some issues
you're likely to encounter in the wild:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does missing data look like? The empty string, <code>NaN</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>1/1-1970</code>,
  <code>null</code>, <code>nil</code>, <code>NULL</code>, <code>\0</code>?</li>
<li>What date format will you need to parse? What does <code>5/5/12</code> mean?</li>
<li>How multiline data has been written? Does it use quotation marks, properly
  escape those inside multiline strings, or maybe it just expects you to count
  the delimiter and by the way can delimiters occur inside bare strings?</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the infurating things about the format is that things often break in ways
that tools can't pick up and tell you about, leading to data corruption instead
of an error. I remember spending hours trying to identify an issue that caused
columns to "shift" around 80% into a 40GB CSV file, and let me tell you, that
just isn't fun. In the end, this came down to a problem that needed to be fixed
in the source, which was producing invalid CSVs, and I wasn't able to work
around the issue using spark on my end, because I needed to process and fix the
records serially to avoid the issue and at that point, why would I want to use a
cluster anyway.</p>
<h2>CSV files have terrible compression and performance</h2>
<p>If you start building something that's producing or consuming CSV files, you
quickly discover that it's annoying to ship them around. Storage is cheap, but
performance matters and shipping around 50GB files take a lot of time.</p>
<p>The next logical move from there is to tack on compression and end up with
<code>.csv.gz</code> or <code>.csv.zip</code> or some other format that's essentially still CSV.
For the type of data that we use CSV for, this often leads to amazing
compression, perhaps a factor of 10 or 20. Unfortunately, this leads to
vastly more expensive loading and querying of the files. The worst case is if
you need to query for something near the tail end of the file -- the file now
<em>must</em>  be read serially, there's no way to seek to somewhere close to where
the data must be. This is perhaps fine if you're going to read all of the
records every time the file is loaded, but even then you're still going to be
paying with performance, it'll take a long time to uncompress big files and
materialize the data in memory. All of the textual data in the file must be
uncompressed and moved to RAM.</p>
<p>Another issue is related to data types. Most CSV readers will read
<code>"2024-03-24T21:39:23.930074+01:00"</code> into a 32 character long string, which may
be well in excess of 32 bytes, depending on how a string is represented in
memory in your programming environment (in Python, for example, this string
weighs 81 bytes). Then it'll hopefully be parsed into an 8 byte integer and
one byte timezone offset, and we do the reverse when we serialize again. This is
a lot of wasted effort, compared to just storing the 8 byte integer and
the one byte offset to begin with. If you work in an environment like pandas,
where you want to materialize the whole data set in memory before you process
it, this explosion in size quickly limits how much data you can actually process
at all, before reaching for a more complex tool, like spark.</p>
<p>Numerical columns may also be ambigious, there's no way to know if you can read
a numerical column into an integral data type, or if you need to reach for a
float without first reading all the records. There's tons of variations in how
we serialize and deserialize bools too. Chances are pretty good that you'll
spend quite a while looking at your file before you can parse it correctly.</p>
<h2>There's a better way</h2>
<p>Actually, there are many file formats that are more suitable to working with
tabular data. I'm a big fan of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Parquet">Apache Parquet</a> as a good default.
You give up human readable files, but what you gain in return is incredibly
valuable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-describing files that contain their own schema so data is loaded with
  the right data types automatically.</li>
<li>Really good compression properties, competetive with <code>.csv.gz</code> when run-length
  encoding works well for the data.</li>
<li>Effortless and super fast loading of data into memory, since the files contain
  their own schema, you do not need to sit down and work out data types before
  loading, you simply ask the file.</li>
<li>You only pay for the columns that you actually load, unused columns do not
  need to be read from disk/network. This means you can offer incredibly wide
  tables and let the user specify columns on loading from the network, rather
  than making one export for each permutation of columns that's requested.</li>
<li>Support for complex data types, like record types or arrays.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other binary data formats that also work really well, but for the use
case where people often reach for CSV, parquet is easily my favorite. If you
absolutely must do streaming writes with record-oriented data, perhaps you
should look into something like <a href="https://avro.apache.org/">Avro</a> instead.</p>
<h2>Backing it up with numbers: Compression</h2>
<p>I've claimed that parquet is a vastly superior file format to CSV, both when it
comes to compression, convenience and performance so let's do some experiments
to back that up. I'm going to be presenting some file size and timing
information and I'll be using <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> and
<a href="https://pola.rs/">polars</a> for my examples, the code is written is run using
IPython.</p>
<p>To get some numbers, I've downloaded
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hikne707/big-five-european-soccer-leagues/data">this football dataset</a>
from kaggle, containing 44269 football match scores from 1995 to 2020. This is a
3.7MB CSV file, containing 1 date column, a country column, team names columns
and other than that primarily small ints, a total of 14 columns.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at what kind of compression we can achieve by transforming it
into <code>.csv.gz</code> and <code>.pq</code> first. This is the code I used to load the file and
transform it into parquet:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>dtype</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>'Team 1'</span><span>:</span> <span>'category'</span><span>,</span> <span>'FT'</span><span>:</span> <span>'category'</span><span>,</span> <span>'HT'</span><span>:</span> <span>'category'</span><span>,</span>

    <span>'Team 1 (pts)'</span><span>:</span> <span>'int8'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Team 2 (pts)'</span><span>:</span> <span>'int8'</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>df</span> <span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>read_csv</span><span>(</span><span>'BIG FIVE 1995-2019.csv'</span><span>,</span> <span>dtype</span><span>=</span><span>dtype</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>assign</span><span>(</span>
    <span>Date</span><span>=</span><span>lambda</span> <span>df</span><span>:</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>to_datetime</span><span>(</span><span>df</span><span>.</span><span>Date</span><span>,</span> <span>format</span><span>=</span><span>'(</span><span>%a</span><span>) </span><span>%d</span><span> %b %Y (W%W)'</span><span>)</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>df</span><span>.</span><span>to_parquet</span><span>(</span><span>'football.pq'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Notice how the date column has a somewhat annoying format that looks like this:
<code>"(Sat) 19 Aug 1995 (W33)"</code> -- it already took me quite a while to find the
correct format string to parse that, which I wouldn't have had to do if this was
a binary file format with native support for timestamps. Let's take a look at
how the file sizes came out:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>du -hs BIG\ FIVE\ 1995-2019.csv BIG\ FIVE\ 1995-2019.csv.gz football.pq
3.7M    BIG FIVE 1995-2019.csv
472K    BIG FIVE 1995-2019.csv.gz
376K    football.pq
</code></pre></div>

<p>In this case, the <code>.pq</code> ended up being smaller than the <code>.csv.gz</code>.</p>
<h2>Backing it up with numbers: Performance</h2>
<p>Let's check the relative time difference it takes to load both into memory:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>%timeit</span><span> </span><span>df</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>read_parquet</span><span>(</span><span>"football.pq"</span><span>)</span>
<span># 2.26 ms ± 60.8 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)</span>

<span>%</span><span>%timeit</span>
<span>df</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>read_csv</span><span>(</span><span>"BIG FIVE 1995-2019.csv.gz"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>dtype</span><span>=</span><span>dtype</span><span>).</span><span>assign</span><span>(</span>
<span>    </span><span>Date</span><span>=</span><span>lambda</span><span> </span><span>df</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>to_datetime</span><span>(</span><span>df</span><span>.</span><span>Date</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>format</span><span>=</span><span>"(%a) %d %b %Y (W%W)"</span><span>)</span>
<span>)</span>
<span># 47.1 ms ± 380 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)</span>

<span>%</span><span>%timeit</span>
<span>df</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>read_csv</span><span>(</span><span>"BIG FIVE 1995-2019.csv"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>dtype</span><span>=</span><span>dtype</span><span>).</span><span>assign</span><span>(</span>
<span>    </span><span>Date</span><span>=</span><span>lambda</span><span> </span><span>df</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>to_datetime</span><span>(</span><span>df</span><span>.</span><span>Date</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>format</span><span>=</span><span>"(%a) %d %b %Y (W%W)"</span><span>)</span>
<span>)</span>
<span># 41.8 ms ± 880 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>To summarize, in this case:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>.pq</code> file is smaller than the CSV by a factor of about 10, and it's
  also smaller than the <code>.csv.gz</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>.pq</code> file is faster to load by a factor of about 25 compared to the
  <code>.csv.gz</code> and a factor of around 19 compared to the CSV.</li>
<li>I can load the <code>.pq</code> file with a single instruction, not knowing anything
  about the file up front, whereas I need to figure out the data types and
  date formats up front for both the other options.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just to really drive the point home, let's find out how long it takes to
check how many matches Newcaste United FC have won in this data set with a query
using polars, and run it both against the CSV and against the parquet.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>home_wins</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Note that polars does not allow us to lazy-read a compressed CSV, it needs to
unpack the whole thing anyway, so in order to run a lazy query we need to read
the whole file. With the parquet file, we're now only reading 4 columns and
leaving the majority of them on disk and it's significantly faster than the CSV
file that occupies much more disk space.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Of course, we can't conclude that you should <em>never</em> export to CSV. If your
users are just going to try to find the quickest way to turn your data into CSV
anyway, there's no reason why you shouldn't deliver that. But it's a super
fragile file format to use for anything serious like data integration between
systems, so stick with something that at the very least has a schema and is more
efficient to work with.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How It Works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How It Works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">At a high level, pyenv intercepts Python commands using shim
executables injected into your <code>PATH</code>, determines which Python version
has been specified by your application, and passes your commands along
to the correct Python installation.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Understanding PATH</h3><a id="user-content-understanding-path" aria-label="Permalink: Understanding PATH" href="#understanding-path"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When you run a command like <code>python</code> or <code>pip</code>, your operating system
searches through a list of directories to find an executable file with
that name. This list of directories lives in an environment variable
called <code>PATH</code>, with each directory in the list separated by a colon:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"><pre><code>/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Directories in <code>PATH</code> are searched from left to right, so a matching
executable in a directory at the beginning of the list takes
precedence over another one at the end. In this example, the
<code>/usr/local/bin</code> directory will be searched first, then <code>/usr/bin</code>,
then <code>/bin</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Understanding Shims</h3><a id="user-content-understanding-shims" aria-label="Permalink: Understanding Shims" href="#understanding-shims"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">pyenv works by inserting a directory of <em>shims</em> at the front of your
<code>PATH</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$(pyenv root)/shims:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"><pre><code>$(pyenv root)/shims:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Through a process called <em>rehashing</em>, pyenv maintains shims in that
directory to match every Python command across every installed version
of Python—<code>python</code>, <code>pip</code>, and so on.</p>
<p dir="auto">Shims are lightweight executables that simply pass your command along
to pyenv. So with pyenv installed, when you run, say, <code>pip</code>, your
operating system will do the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Search your <code>PATH</code> for an executable file named <code>pip</code></li>
<li>Find the pyenv shim named <code>pip</code> at the beginning of your <code>PATH</code></li>
<li>Run the shim named <code>pip</code>, which in turn passes the command along to
pyenv</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Understanding Python version selection</h3><a id="user-content-understanding-python-version-selection" aria-label="Permalink: Understanding Python version selection" href="#understanding-python-version-selection"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When you execute a shim, pyenv determines which Python version to use by
reading it from the following sources, in this order:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The <code>PYENV_VERSION</code> environment variable (if specified). You can use
the <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#pyenv-shell"><code>pyenv shell</code></a> command to set this environment
variable in your current shell session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The application-specific <code>.python-version</code> file in the current
directory (if present). You can modify the current directory's
<code>.python-version</code> file with the <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#pyenv-local"><code>pyenv local</code></a>
command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The first <code>.python-version</code> file found (if any) by searching each parent
directory, until reaching the root of your filesystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The global <code>$(pyenv root)/version</code> file. You can modify this file using
the <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#pyenv-global"><code>pyenv global</code></a> command.
If the global version file is not present, pyenv assumes you want to use the "system"
Python (see below).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">A special version name "<code>system</code>" means to use whatever Python is found on <code>PATH</code>
after the shims <code>PATH</code> entry (in other words, whatever would be run if Pyenv
shims weren't on <code>PATH</code>). Note that Pyenv considers those installations outside
its control and does not attempt to inspect or distinguish them in any way.
So e.g. if you are on MacOS and have OS-bundled Python 3.8.9 and Homebrew-installed
Python 3.9.12 and 3.10.2 -- for Pyenv, this is still a single "<code>system</code>" version,
and whichever of those is first on <code>PATH</code> under the executable name you
specified will be run.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>NOTE:</strong> You can activate multiple versions at the same time, including multiple
versions of Python2 or Python3 simultaneously. This allows for parallel usage of
Python2 and Python3, and is required with tools like <code>tox</code>. For example, to instruct
Pyenv to first use your system Python and Python3 (which are e.g. 2.7.9 and 3.4.2)
but also have Python 3.3.6, 3.2.1, and 2.5.2 available, you first <code>pyenv install</code>
the missing versions, then set <code>pyenv global system 3.3.6 3.2.1 2.5.2</code>.
Then you'll be able to invoke any of those versions with an appropriate <code>pythonX</code> or
<code>pythonX.Y</code> name.
You can also specify multiple versions in a <code>.python-version</code> file by hand,
separated by newlines. Lines starting with a <code>#</code> are ignored.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#pyenv-which"><code>pyenv which &lt;command&gt;</code></a> displays which real executable would be
run when you invoke <code>&lt;command&gt;</code> via a shim.
E.g. if you have 3.3.6, 3.2.1 and 2.5.2 installed of which 3.3.6 and 2.5.2 are selected
and your system Python is 3.2.5,
<code>pyenv which python2.5</code> should display <code>$(pyenv root)/versions/2.5.2/bin/python2.5</code>,
<code>pyenv which python3</code> -- <code>$(pyenv root)/versions/3.3.6/bin/python3</code> and
<code>pyenv which python3.2</code> -- path to your system Python due to the fall-through (see below).</p>
<p dir="auto">Shims also fall through to anything further on <code>PATH</code> if the corresponding executable is
not present in any of the selected Python installations.
This allows you to use any programs installed elsewhere on the system as long as
they are not shadowed by a selected Python installation.</p>

<p dir="auto">Once pyenv has determined which version of Python your application has
specified, it passes the command along to the corresponding Python
installation.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each Python version is installed into its own directory under
<code>$(pyenv root)/versions</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, you might have these versions installed:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>$(pyenv root)/versions/2.7.8/</code></li>
<li><code>$(pyenv root)/versions/3.4.2/</code></li>
<li><code>$(pyenv root)/versions/pypy-2.4.0/</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">As far as Pyenv is concerned, version names are simply directories under
<code>$(pyenv root)/versions</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">All Pyenv subcommands except <code>uninstall</code> automatically resolve full prefixes to the latest version in the corresponding version line.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>pyenv install</code> picks the latest known version, while other subcommands pick the latest installed version.</p>
<p dir="auto">E.g. to install and then switch to the latest 3.10 release:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pyenv install 3.10
pyenv global 3.10"><pre>pyenv install 3.10
pyenv global 3.10</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can run <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#pyenv-latest"><code>pyenv latest -k &lt;prefix&gt;</code></a> to see how <code>pyenv install</code> would resolve a specific prefix, or <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#pyenv-latest"><code>pyenv latest &lt;prefix&gt;</code></a> to see how other subcommands would resolve it.</p>
<p dir="auto">See the <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#pyenv-latest"><code>pyenv latest</code> documentation</a> for details.</p>

<p dir="auto">For the following Python releases, Pyenv applies user-provided patches that add support for some newer environments.
Though we don't actively maintain those patches, since existing releases never change,
it's safe to assume that they will continue working until there are further incompatible changes
in a later version of those environments.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><em>3.7.8-3.7.15, 3.8.4-3.8.12, 3.9.0-3.9.7</em> : XCode 13.3</li>
<li><em>3.5.10, 3.6.15</em> : MacOS 11+ and XCode 13.3</li>

<p dir="auto">To select a Pyenv-installed Python as the version to use, run one
of the following commands:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#pyenv-shell"><code>pyenv shell &lt;version&gt;</code></a> -- select just for current shell session</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#pyenv-local"><code>pyenv local &lt;version&gt;</code></a> -- automatically select whenever you are in the current directory (or its subdirectories)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#pyenv-shell"><code>pyenv global &lt;version&gt;</code></a> -- select globally for your user account</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">E.g. to select the above-mentioned newly-installed Python 3.10.4 as your preferred version to use:</p>

<p dir="auto">Now whenever you invoke <code>python</code>, <code>pip</code> etc., an executable from the Pyenv-provided
3.10.4 installation will be run instead of the system Python.</p>
<p dir="auto">Using "<code>system</code>" as a version name would reset the selection to your system-provided Python.</p>
<p dir="auto">See <a href="#understanding-shims">Understanding shims</a> and
<a href="#understanding-python-version-selection">Understanding Python version selection</a>

<p dir="auto">As time goes on, you will accumulate Python versions in your
<code>$(pyenv root)/versions</code> directory.</p>
<p dir="auto">To remove old Python versions, use <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#pyenv-uninstall"><code>pyenv uninstall &lt;versions&gt;</code></a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, you can simply <code>rm -rf</code> the directory of the version you want
to remove. You can find the directory of a particular Python version
with the <code>pyenv prefix</code> command, e.g. <code>pyenv prefix 2.6.8</code>.
Note however that plugins may run additional operations on uninstall
which you would need to do by hand as well. E.g. Pyenv-Virtualenv also
removes any virtual environments linked to the version being uninstalled.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Other operations</h3><a id="user-content-other-operations" aria-label="Permalink: Other operations" href="#other-operations"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Run <code>pyenv commands</code> to get a list of all available subcommands.
Run a subcommand with <code>--help</code> to get help on it, or see the <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md">Commands Reference</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">If you've installed Pyenv with Pyenv-installer, you likely have the
<a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-update">Pyenv-Update</a> plugin that would
upgrade Pyenv and all installed plugins:</p>

<p dir="auto">If you've installed Pyenv using Pyenv-installer or Git checkout, you can also
upgrade your installation at any time using Git.</p>
<p dir="auto">To upgrade to the latest development version of pyenv, use <code>git pull</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cd $(pyenv root)
git pull"><pre><span>cd</span> <span><span>$(</span>pyenv root<span>)</span></span>

<p dir="auto">The simplicity of pyenv makes it easy to temporarily disable it, or
uninstall from the system.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">To <strong>disable</strong> Pyenv managing your Python versions, simply remove the
<code>pyenv init</code> invocations from your shell startup configuration. This will
remove Pyenv shims directory from <code>PATH</code>, and future invocations like
<code>python</code> will execute the system Python version, as it was before Pyenv.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>pyenv</code> will still be accessible on the command line, but your Python
apps won't be affected by version switching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">To completely <strong>uninstall</strong> Pyenv, remove <em>all</em> Pyenv configuration lines
from your shell startup configuration, and then remove
its root directory. This will <strong>delete all Python versions</strong> that were
installed under the <code>$(pyenv root)/versions/</code> directory:</p>

<p dir="auto">If you've installed Pyenv using a package manager, as a final step,
perform the Pyenv package removal. For instance, for Homebrew:</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pyenv plugins</h2><a id="user-content-pyenv-plugins" aria-label="Permalink: Pyenv plugins" href="#pyenv-plugins"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Pyenv provides a simple, flexible and maintainable way to extend and customize its functionality with plugins --
as simple as creating a plugin directory and dropping a shell script on a certain subpath of it
with whatever extra logic you need to be run at certain moments.</p>
<p dir="auto">See <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Plugins"><em>Plugins</em> on the wiki</a> on how to install and use plugins
as well as a catalog of some useful existing plugins for common needs.</p>
<p dir="auto">See <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Authoring-plugins"><em>Authoring plugins</em> on the wiki</a> on writing your own plugins.</p>

<p dir="auto">Skip this section unless you must know what every line in your shell
profile is doing.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also see the <a href="#environment-variables">Environment variables</a> section
for the environment variables that control Pyenv's behavior.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>pyenv init</code> is the only command that crosses the line of loading
extra commands into your shell. Coming from RVM, some of you might be
opposed to this idea. Here's what <code>eval "$(pyenv init -)"</code> actually does:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Sets up the shims path.</strong> This is what allows Pyenv to intercept
and redirect invocations of <code>python</code>, <code>pip</code> etc. transparently.
It prepends <code>$(pyenv root)/shims</code> to your <code>$PATH</code>.
It also deletes any other instances of <code>$(pyenv root)/shims</code> on <code>PATH</code>
which allows to invoke <code>eval "$(pyenv init -)"</code> multiple times without
getting duplicate <code>PATH</code> entries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Installs autocompletion.</strong> This is entirely optional but pretty
useful. Sourcing <code>$(pyenv root)/completions/pyenv.bash</code> will set that
up. There are also completions for Zsh and Fish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Rehashes shims.</strong> From time to time you'll need to rebuild your
shim files. Doing this on init makes sure everything is up to
date. You can always run <code>pyenv rehash</code> manually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Installs <code>pyenv</code> into the current shell as a shell function.</strong>
This bit is also optional, but allows
pyenv and plugins to change variables in your current shell.
This is required for some commands like <code>pyenv shell</code> to work.
The sh dispatcher doesn't do
anything crazy like override <code>cd</code> or hack your shell prompt, but if
for some reason you need <code>pyenv</code> to be a real script rather than a
shell function, you can safely skip it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><code>eval "$(pyenv init --path)"</code> only does items 1 and 3.</p>
<p dir="auto">To see exactly what happens under the hood for yourself, run <code>pyenv init -</code>
or <code>pyenv init --path</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>eval "$(pyenv init -)"</code> is supposed to run at any interactive shell's
startup (including nested shells -- e.g. those invoked from editors)
so that you get completion and convenience shell functions.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>eval "$(pyenv init --path)"</code> can be used instead of <code>eval "$(pyenv init -)"</code>
to just enable shims, without shell integration. It can also be used to bump shims
to the front of <code>PATH</code> after some other logic has prepended stuff to <code>PATH</code>
that may shadow Pyenv's shims.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>In particular, in Debian-based distributions, the stock <code>~/.profile</code>
prepends per-user <code>bin</code> directories to <code>PATH</code> after having sourced <code>~/.bashrc</code>.
This necessitates appending a <code>pyenv init</code> call to <code>~/.profile</code> as well as <code>~/.bashrc</code>
in these distributions because the system's Pip places executables for
modules installed by a non-root user into those per-user <code>bin</code> directories.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">If you don't want to use <code>pyenv init</code> and shims, you can still benefit
from pyenv's ability to install Python versions for you. Just run
<code>pyenv install</code> and you will find versions installed in
<code>$(pyenv root)/versions</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can manually execute or symlink them as required,
or you can use <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#pyenv-exec"><code>pyenv exec &lt;command&gt;</code></a>
whenever you want <code>&lt;command&gt;</code> to be affected by Pyenv's version selection
as currently configured.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>pyenv exec</code> works by prepending <code>$(pyenv root)/versions/&lt;selected version&gt;/bin</code>
to <code>PATH</code> in the <code>&lt;command&gt;</code>'s environment, the same as what e.g. RVM does.</p>
