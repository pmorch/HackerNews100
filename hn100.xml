<p>The first clinical trial to administer gene therapy to both ears in one person has restored hearing function to 5 children born with a form of inherited <a href="https://cosmosmagazine.com/health/preventing-hearing-loss-from-antibiotics/">deafness</a>, astounding the research team..</p>



<p>Two of the children even gained an ability to appreciate music.</p>



<p>The success of the new approach is detailed in a new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03023-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> published in <em>Nature Medicine</em>. The work&nbsp;builds on the first phase of the trial, published <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S014067362302874X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier this year</a>, in which children were treated in a single ear.</p>



<p>“The results from these studies are astounding,” says study co-senior author Zheng-Yi Chen, an associate scientist in the Eaton-Peabody Laboratories at Massachusetts Eye and Ear in the US.</p>



<p>“We continue to see the hearing ability of treated children dramatically progress and the new study shows added benefits of the gene therapy when administrated to both ears, including the ability for sound source localisation and improvements in speech recognition in noisy environments.”</p>



<p>Lead author Yilai Shu, an attending doctor in otolaryngology&nbsp;and an investigator at Eye and Ear, Nose, Throat hospital of Fudan University, China, says: “restoring hearing in both ears of children who are born <a href="https://cosmosmagazine.com/health/body-and-mind/explainer-cochlear-implants-function/">deaf</a> can maximise the benefits of hearing recovery.</p>



        

<p>“These new results show this approach holds great promise and warrants larger international trials.”</p>

</a></p><p>The children involved in the study were born with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7768390/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DFNB9</a>, which accounts for between 2 and 8% of hereditary deafness. It is caused by mutations in the <em>OTOF</em> gene which prevent the production of functioning otoferlin protein, which can significantly reduce sound transmission from the inner ear hair cells to hearing nerves.</p>



<p>Through minimally invasive surgery, Shu injected adeno-associated virus (AAV) engineered to carry and deliver functioning copies of the human <em>OTOF</em> transgene, into the children’s inner ears.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All 5 children were observed over a 13 or 26-week period and showed hearing recovery in both ears, with “dramatic” improvements in speech perception and sound localisation.</p>



<p>During follow-up, 36 adverse events were observed, the most common being increased white blood cell counts and increased cholesterol levels. However, there were no dose-limiting toxicity or serious adverse events.</p>



<p>The trial is continuing, and participant are stillbeing monitored.</p>



<p>The authors say their results show that the gene therapy is “feasible, safe, and efficacious”.</p>

Imagine teaching your grandma how to use her smart TV. This is kind of how Luba talks to Billy. </p><p><span>And yet, they do NOT talk down to their audience. They do not dumb things down. They explain things in a surprising amount of detail. </span><strong>The explanations are concise &amp; straightforward, but NOT dumbed down. </strong></p><p>For example, in this episode they load a video game from a cassette tape. Billy asks this wonderful question:</p><blockquote><p><span>[how is it possible that] all this [non-sound] information, words, letters, and pictures, can be contained in an </span><em>audio </em><span>cassette tape?</span></p></blockquote><p><span>A bad answer to this question would say: “the cassette tape contains the data for the video game, the computer knows how to decode it. You press this button here, load it like this, then you press that button, etc”. This isn’t wrong, and it may in fact contain a lot of detail, but </span><strong>it doesn’t tell me anything about how this system works.</strong></p><p>More importantly: it doesn’t help me interact with it better. It doesn’t allow me to make predictions or develop a model of it in my mind (which is very important for when things go wrong, or when I want to do something outside the scope of instructions). </p><p>Let’s see how Luba answers this question:</p><p>She has him play the tape (which contains machine code for a video game) on an  audio cassette player. To Billy’s surprise, it works just fine, it just produces an awful noise!</p><p>They then proceed to explain what “binary code” is: that we use a series of “on” and “off” switches, and we can choose to make these sequences represent anything: numbers, letters, or commands.</p><p><span>I think this demonstration of playing “text” over an audio player is amazing. I’m drawn to it because this is how I personally developed my own fundamental understanding of what data on a computer </span><em>is</em><span>, and I think it’s beautiful that this is also how we explain it to the layperson. </span></p><p>There is nothing inherently special about text vs images vs audio. ALL of them are stored using the same primitives (0’s and 1’s). They have no inherent meaning. They get their meaning from how you choose to decode them. </p><p>You store the number 65 in binary. That might mean the letter “A” if this is an ASCII text document. It might be a musical note in MIDI. Or something else entirely. </p><p><strong>What does the layperson get out of this?</strong><span> They have a basic, but useful model of how the machine works. I bet you could use this to deduce something like: how would you come up with a basic encryption system? (you could just encode data in a custom way, and not tell anyone!)</span></p><p>I really do believe this matters day to day. It matters when the computer behaves in unexpected ways, or when you think about what is possible in the future. Or even simply, to give yourself a fighting chance to tell what is “easy” and what is “hard” when working with the people who program these things. </p><p>Here’s an example where Billy asks “why is the computer so slow?” and Luba clarifies exactly why it’s slow:</p><p><em>“[these computers] ARE fast, it’s the cassette that’s slow!”</em></p><p>Does the modern layperson know why their computer is slow?

    <time datetime="2024-06-07 19:29:00 -0400">2024-06-07</time>
  </p>

  

  <p>This is the second entry of my series of detecting PS2 emulators. If you haven’t
read it, you can find it <a href="https://fobes.dev/ps2/detecting-emu-vu0-pipeline">here</a>
.</p>

<hr>

<p>This is a pretty straightforward method. This one can be done on VU1,
VU0 micro mode or VU0 macro mode.
For simplicity, I will do it with VU0 macro mode, where VU0 is used as a coprocessor.
That way it can be done directly on the EE CPU without dealing with VU programs.</p>

<h3 id="welcome-to-hell-ps2-floating-point">Welcome to <del>hell</del> PS2 Floating Point</h3>

<p>If you look at any multiplication instruction (MUL,MULi, etc) in the VU developer
manuals, you will see this remark:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is an operation error of 1 bit in multiplication, so the value multiplied by 1 may not be the same as the
original value. By using VF[fs] as a multiplicand, the results of multiplication with 1 are guaranteed to be
accurate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a little bit loaded but the gist of it is, with multiplication operations
<em>1 * X</em> is not guaranteed to result in <em>X</em>, unlike <em>X * 1</em> which is.</p>

<p>The exact reason why a bit is lost is not known to me, whoever decides to
implement software floating point for the PS2 will have to figure that out and
report back :^)</p>

<h3 id="abusing-it">Abusing it</h3>

<p>First things first, we need to figure out a number that triggers this issue. The
easiest way to do that is to brute force it. Thankfully I’ve already done that
in the past. The list of the first 250 numbers (with 0.5 increments) that have
the issue can be found in a
<a href="https://gist.github.com/F0bes/5f209d8a0890879ad0e25ceb6973977a">gist here</a>.</p>

<p>129.5 will be our target number for this detection.</p>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Like I said, it’s pretty straightforward. Load 1 and a special number into a
register, multiply them, check the result.</p>

<p>Currently no emulators (PCSX2, Play!, DobieStation, hps2x64) emulate this behaviour.</p>

<p>The difficulty of this one is definitely a 1/5.<br>
I’ll choose a difficult one next time.</p>

<p>Like many bits of Internet Culture, this simple image of an empty series of rooms represents a deep-repressed or recently-remembered memory of a common Internet Legend, or it’s just a shot of nothing.</p>



<p>If the answer is that it’s a shot of nothing, let’s get you up to speed.</p>



<p>This image floated around message boards in the 2010s, posted with commentary or as a general use for a slightly off-putting photograph of a less-than-well-maintained location, and was, by most standards, rather indistinct. The internet, after all, is filled with odd images and weird drawings that cause a reaction, often after many different attempts to achieve the effect. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias" target="_blank">Survivorship Bias</a> for memes, one might say. So if one more image of an indistinct indoor landscape was out there, not much was going to happen of it.</p>



<p>That changed in 2019, when the image was given a legend and history, made up out of the air, that it was a rare photograph of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Backrooms">The Backrooms</a>. The phrasing of the original declaration speaks for itself:</p>



<p><strong>“If you’re not careful and you noclip out of reality in the wrong areas, you’ll end up in the Backrooms, where it’s nothing but the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz, and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in<br>God save you if you hear something wandering around nearby, because it sure as hell has heard you”</strong></p>



<p>If this writing strikes you as some sort of odd, rather dramatic addition to the image of a room, then you’re being introduced to <em>creepypasta</em>, or as some might call them, <em>urban legends</em> and <em>campfire stories</em>. It’s part of the overwhelming need for humans to tell tales that excite and frighten, to compose meaning or horror out of the darkness, and even the mundane.</p>



<p>The concept of the “Backrooms” also touches on a very frequent theme of many different horror and science-fiction movies – that there are service tunnels and hard to access areas woven throughout life, known only to a special few. Movies such as <em>The Matrix</em>, <em>The Adjustment Bureau</em>, <em>Us</em>, <em>Beyond the Walls</em>, <em>Dark City</em>, <em>The Cube, </em>and many more have explored this theme – or used it as a jumping off point to tell another story. </p>



<p>The difference, here, is nobody really knew where that very first image came from. <em>For a very long time</em>.</p>



<p>This extended period of not finding the original source of the image left an unfinished tune, a half-written poem, about where it came from and what it meant. And the lack of information in the image as it showed up on these image boards seemed to ensure the mystery would never be found.</p>



<p>So people filled in the blanks.</p>

<p>A Subreddit called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/backrooms/" target="_blank">/r/backrooms</a>, an extended <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backrooms_(web_series)" target="_blank">web video series called Backrooms</a>, and endless CGI models and creations meant to extend the legend and the origin story became years of effort by thousands to draw the missing pieces of a puzzle that was never a puzzle.</p>



<p>A constantly shifting set of games with titles based off <em>The Backrooms</em> were created and presented for a willing and happy audience; it’d be unfair to choose one or even a few to highlight – there are dozens.</p>

<p>All of them represent the efforts to bring you into a state of heightened fear or paranoia as you lurked through a series of dark hallways, overlit carpeted spaces, and a growing dread. There’s no question there was a huge audience for this, and it is sometimes thought that this entire legend brought mainstream attention to <strong>liminal spaces</strong>, a perception of the in-between geographies of less unsettling locations. It is now enjoying life as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminal_space_(aesthetic)">aesthetic movement</a>.</p>



<p>Supporting this explosion of creativity and storytelling was the continued fact that <em>nobody knew where the photograph came from</em>. This situation, of a core image having a completely shadowy and unexplained origin, is arguably the foundation of its power.</p>



<p>That changed, recently.</p>

<div><p>In March 2003, there was a former furniture store called Rohner’s Home Furnishings in Oshkosh, Wisconsin whose second floor was being renovated by the (somewhat) new tenants, HobbyTown. </p><p>Renovating the space from the sale of furniture to a new remote-controlled racing car track (among other aspects) meant pulling down partitions and ripping out carpet. This inspired taking photographs of the process, one of which, DSC001561.JPG, was the legendary “Back Rooms” image.</p></div>

<p>18 times in the last 20 years, crawlers affiliated with the Internet Archive moved through this page and grabbed portions of it, speculatively, to store for future research and reference. As the whole image was grabbed, reading the metadata of the original image reveals the date it was taken (June 12, 2002), and the camera used (a Sony Cyber-Shot model). The great unknown image, the unsettling photo of a mysterious place and time, was revealed.</p>



<p>However the original, anonymous user stumbled onto this photograph, it appears it was taken from either the Wayback directly, or the Wayback Machine crawled the same site the user had found, and kept that webpage’s preservation for over 20 years.</p>



<p><strong>Emerging, Blinking, Into the Light</strong></p>



<p>Naturally, as news of the Backrooms being “found” travels throughout the world, responses have wildly ranged.</p>



<p>For some, this is a proof that “with enough eyeballs, all problems are shallow”. While we might argue about the relative worth of a given effort, the fact that it is possible for word to travel about a mystery to the point of being solved means that the world is a hair less intimidating and scary. Our shared efforts and cooperation can find the answer to a seemingly impossible-to-answer question. The fact that an image with basically no information and a blurry set of components could be tracked down and revealed is a miracle.</p>



<p>For others, the mystery being solved removes a little bit of magic and wonder from the world. It says that there’s no kayfabe, no holding of mystery in our hands without peeking further to tear out the secret. In this perspective, something special has been lost.</p>



<p>But there’s another lesson as well.</p>



<p>The Internet Archive’s crawlers moved through the pages of a hobby store multiple times over the years, capturing HTML, photographs, and time-stamping the process, with the equivalent care of an at-risk website, a politician on the national stage, or a legendary and obvious moment in history provided via a PDF file.</p>



<p>This agnostic, wide-ranging crawl likely represented both the original source of the image, and a persistent, dependable URL to reference back to it, as thousands are doing at this very moment.</p>



<p><strong>This is the mission of the Wayback Machine – be the dependable, accessible connection to web history, and therefore all history. Give the Internet its Memory, which would otherwise be lost.</strong></p>



<p>If you mourn the loss of legend and mystery in our quest to keep the truth transparent, available and persistent, don’t worry – the process of internalizing and analyzing the image to give the Backrooms history its full and complete story has already begun:</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>tl;dr LSP-AI abstracts complex implementation details from editor specific plugin authors, centralizing open-source development work into one shareable backend.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Editor integrated AI-powered assistants are here to stay. They are not perfect, but are only improving and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.15331" rel="nofollow">early research is already showing the benefits</a>. While several companies have released advanced AI-powered editors like <a href="https://cursor.sh/" rel="nofollow">Cursor</a>, the open-source community lacks a direct competitor.</p>
<p dir="auto">LSP-AI aims to fill this gap by providing a language server that integrates AI-powered functionality into the editors we know and love. Here’s why we believe LSP-AI is necessary and beneficial:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Unified AI Features</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>By centralizing AI features into a single backend, LSP-AI allows supported editors to benefit from these advancements without redundant development efforts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Simplified Plugin Development</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>LSP-AI abstracts away the complexities of setting up LLM backends, building complex prompts and soon much more. Plugin developers can focus on enhancing the specific editor they are working on, rather than dealing with backend intricacies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Enhanced Collaboration</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Offering a shared backend creates a collaborative platform where open-source developers can come together to add new functionalities. This unified effort fosters innovation and reduces duplicated work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Broad Compatibility</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>LSP-AI supports any editor that adheres to the Language Server Protocol (LSP), ensuring that a wide range of editors can leverage the AI capabilities provided by LSP-AI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Flexible LLM Backend Support</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Currently, LSP-AI supports llama.cpp, OpenAI-compatible APIs, Anthropic-compatible APIs and Mistral AI FIM-compatible APIs, giving developers the flexibility to choose their preferred backend. This list will soon grow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Future-Ready</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>LSP-AI is committed to staying updated with the latest advancements in LLM-driven software development.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Roadmap</h2><a id="user-content-roadmap" aria-label="Permalink: Roadmap" href="#roadmap"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There is so much to do for this project and incredible new research and tools coming out everyday. Below is a list of some ideas for what we want to add next, but we welcome any contributions and discussion around prioritizing new features.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Implement semantic search-powered context building (This could be incredibly cool and powerful). Planning to use <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/" rel="nofollow">Tree-sitter</a> to chunk code correctly.</li>

    </div><p>In a new study published in the journal <i>iScience</i>, researchers from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the Institut Botànic de Barcelona (IBB-CSIC) in Spain present a new record-holder for the largest amount of DNA stored in the nucleus of any living organism on the planet.</p>


										      
																																	<p>Coming in at more than 100 meters of unraveled DNA, the New Caledonian fork fern species Tmesipteris oblanceolata was found to contain more than 50 times more DNA than humans and has dethroned the Japanese flowering plant species Paris japonica, which has held this record since 2010.</p>
<p>In addition, the plant has achieved three Guinness World Records titles for Largest plant genome, Largest Genome, and Largest fern genome for the amount of DNA in the nucleus.</p>
<p>T. oblanceolata is a rare species of fern found on the island nation of New Caledonia, an overseas French territory situated in the Southwest Pacific, about 750 miles east of Australia, and some of the neighboring islands such as Vanuatu. The genus Tmesipteris is an understudied group of plants consisting of about 15 species, most of which occur across a range of Pacific Islands and Oceania.</p>
<p>Until now, scientists have only estimated the size of the genomes for two species of Tmesipteris—T. tannensis and T. obliqua—both of which were found to contain gigantic genomes, at 73.19 and 147.29 gigabase pairs (Gbp) respectively.</p>
<p>In 2023, lead authors Dr. Jaume Pellicer and Dr. Oriane Hidalgo, from the IBB and formerly of RBG Kew, traveled to New Caledonia to collect samples of Tmesipteris, which were then analyzed to estimate the size of their genomes. This involved isolating the nuclei of thousands of cells, staining them with a dye and then measuring how much dye had bound to the DNA within each nucleus—the more dye, the bigger the genome.</p>

</figure><p>The analysis revealed the species T. oblanceolata to have a record-breaking genome size of 160.45 Gbp, which is about 7% larger than that of P. japonica (148.89 Gbp).</p>
<p>When unraveled, the DNA from each cell of this fern would stand taller than the Elizabeth Tower in Westminster, London, which is 96m tall and home to the world-famous Big Ben bell. For comparison, the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/human+genome/" rel="tag">human genome</a> contains about 3.1 Gbp distributed across 23 chromosomes and when stretched out like a ball of yarn, the length of DNA in each cell only measures about 2m.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>Dr. Pellicer, a researcher in <a href="https://phys.org/tags/evolutionary+biology/" rel="tag">evolutionary biology</a>, says, "Tmesipteris is a unique and fascinating small genus of ferns, whose ancestors evolved about 350 million years ago—well before dinosaurs set foot on Earth—and it is distinguished by its mainly epiphytic habit [it grows mainly on the trunks and branches of trees] and restricted distribution in Oceania and several Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>"For a long time, we thought that breaking the previous size record of Paris japonica was going to be an impossible mission, but once again, the limits of biology have surpassed our most optimistic predictions.</p>
<p>"Based on our previous research, we anticipated the existence of giant genomes in Tmesipteris. That said, discovering the largest genome of them all is not just a feat of scientific exploration, but the result of an almost fourteen-year journey into the boundless complexity and diversity of plant genomes."</p>
<p>To date, scientists across the globe have estimated the genome sizes of more than 20,000 <a href="https://phys.org/tags/eukaryotic+organisms/" rel="tag">eukaryotic organisms</a>, revealing in the process a wide range of genome sizes across the tree of life. These, in turn, have been found to have a profound impact not only on their anatomy, as bigger genomes need bigger cells to house them and take longer to replicate, but also how they function, evolve, and where and how they live.</p>

<p>In animals, some of the largest genomes include the marbled lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus) at 129.90 Gbp and the Neuse River waterdog (Necturus lewisi) at 117.47 Gbp. In stark contrast, six of the largest-known eukaryotic genomes are held by plants, including the European mistletoe (Viscum album) at 100.84 Gbp.</p>

																																			<p>Surprisingly, having a larger genome is usually not an advantage. In the case of plants, species possessing large amounts of DNA are restricted to being slow growing perennials, are less efficient at photosynthesis (the process by which plants convert the sun's energy into sugars) and require more nutrients (especially nitrogen and phosphates) to grow and compete successfully with their smaller-genomed neighbors. In turn, such effects may influence the ability of a plant to adapt to climate change and their risk of extinction.</p>
<p>Dr. Ilia Leitch, Senior Research Leader—Character Evolution, at RBG Kew, says, "Who would have thought this tiny, unassuming plant that most people would likely walk past without notice, could bear a world-beating record in genome size.</p>
<p>"Compared to other organisms, plants are incredibly diverse when viewed at the DNA level, and that should make us pause to think about their intrinsic value in the wider picture of global biodiversity. This discovery also raises many new and exciting questions about the upper limits of what is biologically possible, and we hope to solve these mysteries one day."</p>
<p>Adam Millward, Managing Editor of Guinness World Records, says, "To think this innocuous-looking fern boasts 50 times more DNA than humans is a humbling reminder that there's still so much about the plant kingdom we don't know, and that record holders aren't always the showiest on the outside."</p>

The CVR fitted to G-FDZS was not removed from the aircraft as it continually overwrites itself, retaining only the last two hours of audio.</p><p>“As such, the recording of the takeoff would have been overwritten during the flight to Las Palmas. However, the FDR was removed and downloaded”.</p><p>The incident is the latest in a string of problems with Boeing jets in recent years.</p><p>The aerospace giant’s safety standards are coming under increasing scrutiny following several <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/boeing-737-max-safety-aircraft-passengers-crash-b2542773.html"><u>recent incidents</u></a>, including one <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/alaska-airlines-passengers-boeing-lawsuit-b2506896.html"><u>where a disused door fell off a brand new 737 Max shortly after take-off.</u></a> There were no injuries.</p><p>In April a FedEx Airlines Boeing cargo plane landed at Istanbul Airport without the front landing gear deployed but managed to stay on the runway.</p><p>Five years ago, Boeing agreed to pay $2.5bn and make safety improvements after <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/boeing-british-nairobi-addis-ababa-ethiopia-b2372747.html"><u>two new 737 Max jets crashed </u></a>within the space of five months - one in Indonesia in 2018 and one in Ethiopia in 2019, killing a total of 346 people.</p><p>In May US officials <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/boeing-whistleblower-safety-report-news-b2538763.html"><u>warned Boeing it could face criminal charges</u></a> after claims the airline failed to improve plane safety and adhere to a settlement after the deadly 737 crashes.</p><p>A TUI UK&amp;I spokesperson said: “We have worked closely with the authorities to provide all available information.</p><p>“The AAIB recommendations and learnings resulting from this take-off will support the whole aviation sector and other airlines.

<p>Hi, my name is Radon. I graduated college last year and now work as a
software engineer in DevOps/Infrastructure. In my free time, I also
maintain <a href="https://github.com/raxod502">a number of open-source
projects</a>.</p>
<p>While I was in college, I interned at the startup Replit. This blog
post is the story of how Replit is using legal threats and their
venture-capital funding to bully me into shutting down an open-source
project they don’t like.</p>

<h2 id="whats-replit" tabindex="-1">What’s Replit?</h2>
<p>Replit makes a webapp you can use to run code online in different
programming languages. This is nothing new (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=run+python+online">just Google “run python
online”</a> for
proof), so Replit’s value proposition is extra features like sharing
your work, installing third-party packages, and hosting webapps.</p>
<p>I worked for Replit in Summer 2019, where I was asked to rebuild
Replit’s package management stack and make it open-source. If you like
reading about tech stuff, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210504051428/https://blog.replit.com/upm">here’s the post I wrote for Replit’s
blog</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/raxod502/upm">here’s the code on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I took a job elsewhere in Summer 2020, but still chatted with them
occasionally by email when they reached out to tell me about something
cool Replit had developed.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-open-source-project" tabindex="-1">What was my open-source project?</h2>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/riju-languages.png" alt="Screenshot of
language select page in Riju" width="100%"></center>
<p>The aspect of Replit that I really enjoyed was how it supported lots
of different programming languages. (I wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210504023410/https://blog.replit.com/elisp">another blog post for
Replit</a>
about how they do that.) That got me thinking: how many programming
languages could you possibly cram into a single website?</p>
<p>To explore that question, I put together my own little webapp that
could run code online. After about a day, I had something that worked.
(If you’re wondering why it was so fast—it turns out you only need
<a href="https://github.com/raxod502/python-in-a-box">30 lines of code</a> to let
people run Python code in a webapp! This may be why there are so many
websites for running Python online…)</p>
<p>After it was working, I started adding as many different programming
languages as I could. As you can see from this excerpt of my project’s
version history, I got a little overexcited:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>I eventually ended up with 216 languages, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210512193221/https://replit.com/languages">all 38 languages
from
Replit</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/mame/quine-relay">all 100 languages from Yusuke Endoh’s “Quine
Relay”</a>, and a good deal more
besides. You might ask: Why did I spend so much time adding obscure
programming languages to a webapp nobody was going to use? Well, let
me put it this way: Is it the weirdest 2020 hobby you’ve seen?</p>

<p>One day, I got an email from Replit letting me know about a new
feature they released. I figured this was a good time to share my
open-source project with them, in case they wanted to take inspiration
from any of my work:</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-email-1.png" alt="Screenshot of an
email from Replit sharing a post from their blog, and my response
sharing my open-source project with them" width="100%"></center>
<p>At first, I got a positive response. But then, 30 minutes later, out
of nowhere, Replit accused me of unethical behavior and stealing their
design:</p>

<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-email-2.png" alt="Screenshot of
one email from Replit praising my open-source project, and an
immediately subsequent one accusing me of unethical behavior and
stealing 'internal design decisions'" width="100%"></center>
<p>Now, none of the ideas I used in my open-source project were “internal
design decisions”: they’ve all been published publicly on Replit’s
blog (I knew this because I’d been asked to <em>write</em> some of those blog
posts during my internship). And my project also wasn’t any more of a
Replit clone than any of the other websites on the first few pages of
Google results for “run python online”, most of which look exactly the
same:</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-ui-montage.png" alt="Screenshot of
nine different webapps that let you run Python online, all of which
look more or less identical" width="100%"></center>
<p>But I figured I might have missed something, so I asked for details:</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-email-3.png" alt="Screenshot
excerpt of my email asking Replit for details about what ideas they
were claiming I stole" width="100%"></center>
<p>(The rest of this email is basically me repeating the previous
paragraph of this article, but with a lot more technical details. You
can read the whole email <a href="https://imgur.com/a/OaEOwu2">on Imgur</a>,
mirrored <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210530184721/https://imgur.com/a/OaEOwu2">on the Internet
Archive</a>.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Replit refused to provide any specifics on what they
were saying I had done wrong, reiterated their previous statements,
and threatened me with a lawsuit:</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-email-4.png" alt="Screenshot of an
email from Replit threatening me with a lawsuit" width="100%"></center>
<p>And then just to put a cherry on top, Replit sent me another email
reminding me that they <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/18/replit-raises-20-million-for-collaborative-browser-based-coding/">just raised $20 million from their investors
last
month</a>,
and they weren’t afraid to use it against me. The “me” in question
being one of their previous interns who just graduated from college a
year ago, and who isn’t running any kind of commercial operation
whatsoever.</p>

<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-email-5.png" alt="Screenshot of an
email from Replit threatening me with their money" width="100%"></center>
<p>I’d like to point out two things about this email:</p>
<ul>
<li>The remark about “commits like this”—this is actually misleading.
There’s only one commit in my project that mentions Replit, and it’s
the one I already showed you earlier, from my third day of coding,
when I’d just added all 38 languages that Replit supported, before
moving onto the 178 other languages I wanted to add.</li>
<li>The remark about me being a “demanding” intern—I’m not actually
sure what this is meant to imply, especially since Replit had just
tried to recruit me earlier that day (see the screenshot of their
first email). But I’ll leave it alone because it’s not really
relevant to the issue at hand.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-happened-after-replit-threatened-to-sue-me" tabindex="-1">What happened after Replit threatened to sue me?</h2>
<p>Naturally, I took down my project right away, gave it some time for
feelings to cool, and sent Replit an apology. I figured something
might have been lost over email, so I asked to get on a call:</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-email-6.png" alt="Screenshot of an
email in which I apologize to Replit and ask to have a call" width="100%"></center>
<p>Unfortunately, Replit ignored this email, so I sent them another one
following up. This one got a response, but not the one I was hoping
for:</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-email-7.png" alt="Screenshot of an
email from Replit making it clear that they have no intention of
talking to me further" width="100%"></center>
<p>Just in case Replit didn’t understand that I wasn’t OK with this
situation, I sent three follow-up emails explaining as such over the
next few weeks, all of which were ignored.</p>
<p>In other words, Replit stands by its threat: if I re-publish my
open-source project, then they will sue me with “top lawyers”.</p>
<h2 id="is-replit-right" tabindex="-1">Is Replit right?</h2>
<p>Replit claimed that my open-source project was:</p>
<ol>
<li>a clone of Replit</li>
<li>based on their trade secrets (“internal design decisions”)</li>
<li>unethical to build</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s examine this claim, part by part:</p>
<ol>
<li>In developing my project, was I making a clone of Replit?</li>
<li>In developing my project, did I make use of any trade secrets of
Replit?</li>
<li>Was it unethical for me to develop an open-source project that’s
similar to Replit, after working for them?</li>
</ol>
<p>Questions 1 and 2 have a fair number of technical details, so I’ve put
them <a href="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/tech/replit/evidence">in a separate post</a>. The TL;DR is:</p>
<ol>
<li>My project isn’t any more similar to Replit than the 15 other
(commercial!) ones you can find on Google by searching “run python
online” or “online programming environment”.</li>
<li>Every similarity between my project and Replit can be explained by
looking only at GitHub repositories and blog posts that were
<em>published online by Replit itself</em>, making them obviously not any
kind of secret.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s address question 3 here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Was it unethical for me to develop an open-source project that’s
similar to Replit, after working for them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, the answer to this question is no, for a number of
reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Riju is entirely non-commercial. Unlike Replit, I didn’t seek
funding from any source—advertising, donations, fundraising,
subscriptions, whatever. I have no interest in running a business,
and never really <em>wanted</em> Riju to become too popular, since I was
the one paying the server bill.</li>
<li>Riju wasn’t stealing customers from Replit. Based on my analytics
data, there were 38 visits to Riju during the month of February.
(Half of those were probably me.) Meanwhile, Replit had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210505162911/https://twitter.com/Replit/status/1389976994423525378">over 7
million
users</a>.
There’s obviously no sense in which Riju was competing with Replit.</li>
<li>Riju wasn’t <em>built</em> as a competitor to Replit, either. Since the
architecture was limited to running on a single server, anyone could
bring the entire system down just by typing in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb">fork
bomb</a>—and one of my
friends did, just to see what would happen. (The system crashed.) If
I were designing a product to compete with Replit, I certainly
wouldn’t have picked an architecture that could only scale to
toy-project size.</li>
<li>Replit’s core value proposition isn’t letting you run code online
(you can do this in dozens of places for free), it’s the features
they offer on top of running code. Riju categorically lacked all of
these features, including: having a user account, saving your work,
sharing your work, publishing webapps, persistent workspaces,
discussion forums, integration with GitHub, etc. etc.</li>
<li>I had no bad intentions towards Replit when developing Riju, and
wasn’t trying to hide anything. As proof of these claims, I offer
the fact that I had the project public on my GitHub from the
beginning, and the fact that Replit found out about the project
because I openly shared it with them of my own volition, extending
an offer for them to take inspiration from my work.</li>
<li>Riju was never intended to be a product, it was intended to be a
personal playground / art piece. As proof of this claim, I offer the
fact that I spent dozens of hours adding languages like
<a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Hexagony">Hexagony</a> and
<a href="https://www.snobol4.org/">SNOBOL</a> rather making it so you could
save your work(!).</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not a business person. I’m just an open-source dev who likes to
build weird things for fun. (If you doubt my track record of building
things that don’t make money, just check out <a href="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/about/projects">the list on my
website</a>, and note the conspicuous absence of
anything that’s ever made a cent of revenue.)</p>
<p>I would never try to steal someone’s business after I worked with
them. Hurting Replit was not my intent in working on Riju, and to
accuse me otherwise—especially without asking a single clarifying
question, and refusing all offers to have a discussion—shows a great
deal of bad faith on the part of Replit, in my opinion.</p>
<p>If you’d like to decide for yourself who is in the right, I’m happy to
put all of the evidence out in the open (except the code, because
Replit’s standing by its promise to sue me if I do). Again, I have <a href="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/tech/replit/evidence">a
separate post</a> with all the technical details. And you can
also read all communications between me and Replit, in full and
unabridged form, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/OaEOwu2">on Imgur</a>, mirrored <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210530184721/https://imgur.com/a/OaEOwu2">on
the Internet
Archive</a>).
(Technical details about Replit internals redacted, as well as any
statement that could reveal such details indirectly.)</p>
<h2 id="why-would-replit-do-this" tabindex="-1">Why would Replit do this?</h2>
<p>Replit’s stated ideals include:</p>
<ul>
<li>encouraging open-source development (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/replit">open-sourcing parts of
their technology</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210522215545/https://blog.replit.com/github">adding GitHub support
to
Replit</a>;
Replit’s CEO: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210108083314/https://amasad.me/github">“I owe my entire career to
open-source”</a>)</li>
<li>giving back to the community (from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210504051428/https://blog.replit.com/upm">the blog post Replit asked me to
write</a>:
“we are migrating […] to do our part in improving the ecosystem
for developers everywhere”; “Giving back to the community. The core
of our language-agnostic package management is now open-source on
GitHub”)</li>
<li>making it easy to share and remix your creations (e.g. Replit’s CEO
on learning to program: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210522215545/https://blog.replit.com/github">“I’d download projects related to what I
wanted to build […] change &amp; tinker with them, and get
inspired”</a>;
he advises others to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210522212135/https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1395074521804148738">fork</a>
and
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210211025614/https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1359697571011125253">remix</a>
too, and sells this philosophy as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210522212034/https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1392517080017108992">a differentiating feature of
Replit</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, Replit’s actions in this case reveal hypocrisy:</p>
<ul>
<li>they say they encourage open-source development, but when my
open-source project offended them, they shut it down with extreme
prejudice</li>
<li>they claim to be giving back to the community through their
open-source and blog posts, but when I tried to use those ideas in a
community project, they threatened to sue me</li>
<li>they say they make it easy to share and remix your creations—but
when I tried to remix Replit itself, I became a <em>persona non grata</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In Replit’s emails to me, their threats were based on the fact that I
had worked for them in the past. However, I believe this reasoning is
a smokescreen. To see why, let’s take a look at some tweets that
Replit’s CEO, Amjad, posted just after threatening me by email:</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-tweet-1.png" alt="Screenshot of
Amjad's deleted tweet calling for 'copycats' to be banned from venture
capital" width="75%"></center>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-tweet-2.png" alt="Screenshot of
Amjad's deleted tweet denigrating 'copycats'" width="60%"></center>
<p>Amjad later deleted these tweets because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210505050939/https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1377604981549752320">they proved
controversial</a>:</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-tweet-3.png" alt="Screenshot of
Amjad's tweet explaining that they deleted their previous,
controversial tweets" width="60%"></center>
<p>In these tweets, Amjad points out that Athens Research was clearly
inspired by another company, and argues that they should therefore be
“ridiculed” and banned from receiving funding. Furthermore, he says:
“I stand by what I said about copycats in general”, i.e. he disdains
all people that he thinks are “copying” existing ones, not just the
specific company in his tweet.</p>
<p>There is a clear resemblance between Amjad’s comments on Athens
Research and his legal threats towards my own project. He even used
exactly the same word, “copycat”, in both. In the case of Athens
Research, there was nothing Amjad could do to express his disdain
besides denigrate them on Twitter. But in my case, since I had worked
for Replit before, Amjad had an excuse to throw accusations my
way—accusations that, if you aren’t familiar with the facts, sound
like they could be legitimate.</p>
<p>I’d also like to reiterate that the person Replit is threatening with
“top lawyers” and “a lot of money” is a <em>new grad</em> with <em>no company</em>,
<em>no funding</em>, and <em>no commercial ambitions</em>. If someone with an actual
commercial enterprise were to offend Replit, I shudder to think what
treatment <em>they</em> might receive.</p>

</p>
<h2 id="how-did-replit-respond-to-this-blog-post" tabindex="-1">How did Replit respond to this blog post?</h2>
<p>After I posted the article in the morning, it was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27424195">discussed
extensively on Hacker
News</a>. Around 5pm,
Amjad posted an apology on Hacker News, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27429234">which has also been
discussed</a>.</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/amjad-hn-1.png" alt="Screenshot of an
email from Amjad apologizing for making legal threats, and my reply
indicating I would like to have a call" width="70%"></center>
<p>He also reached out to schedule a call, which I naturally agreed to:</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-email-8.png" alt="Screenshot of an
email from Amjad promising that he will not sue me, and my response
thanking him and clarifying a point about how he quoted me" width="100%"></center>
<p>During the call, Amjad apologized for making legal threats, but
reiterated that he felt I had made a clone of Replit and that I had
acted unethically. Eventually we agreed to disagree, and he promised
in writing that he was fine with my putting my project back up:</p>
<center><img src="https://intuitiveexplanations.com/assets/replit-email-9.png" alt="Screenshot of
Amjad's comment on HackerNews saying that he apologizes for making
legal threats, but still feels I acted unethically" width="100%"></center>
<p>In retrospect, I’m a little disappointed that Amjad:</p>
<ul>
<li>didn’t apologize for (or mention) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210608153700/https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1401957368510906369">publicly doubling
down</a>
on his decision to threaten me, and didn’t post an update to that
thread after the phone call</li>
<li>didn’t apologize for (or mention) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210607231029/https://twitter.com/amasad">publicly
retweeting</a>
an accusation that I “literally stole and published IP”, although he
did at least delete the retweet</li>
<li>didn’t apologize for (or mention) making a <a href="#replit-email-5">nebulous personal
attack</a> in writing that I was a “demanding intern”
right after <a href="#replit-email-2">trying to hire me</a></li>
<li>said in the phone call, right after “apologizing”, that he felt as
if he had invited me into his house and I had betrayed his trust</li>
<li>still refused to list any specific part of Replit he thought I had
copied, even when I asked him for such details multiple times during
the phone call, despite his continuing to claim both privately and
publicly that I copied Replit unethically</li>
<li>misquoted me in writing to make me look like I agreed with his
accusations, right after reaching out to apologize for his behavior</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I think this could have gone better.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I’m happy that we were able to get the situation worked
out amicably, and I look forward to moving on with my life—including
putting Riju back up, after I can get things compiling again :)</p>
<p>Peace.</p>

            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
            <p>This post will focus on how we produce fresh water and how we dispose
              of wastewater at the South Pole.</p>
            <p>The majority of the world’s population lives in coastal regions, and researchers in Antarctica are no exception.</p>
            <p>Most Antarctic research stations sit on or near the coast.
              Coastal stations are easier to operate, because
              the ocean provides a moderating effect on the climate, access to ship-based transportation,
              a water source, and a mechanism to dispose of (hopefully treated!) wastewater.</p>
            <p>In addition, many of the interesting scientific sites are located near the coast. The majority of human
              activity in Antarctica is for scientific research purposes, so it makes sense to situate these stations nearby
              the sites that they are designed to help study.</p>
            <p>In fact, there are only three year-round stations that are <strong><em>not</em></strong> located on the coast. Here’s a
              decent map of major Antarctic research facilities, from
              <a href="https://www.comnap.aq/antarctic-facilities-information">COMNAP</a>

              are summer-only facilities.</p>

            <p>This is not an exhaustive map. I’m aware of stations that are not shown here.
              This is a decent estimation showing the general pattern of human activity in Antarctica. If your station
              isn’t shown here, please do not get mad at me. Take it up with CONMAP.</p>
            <p>The South Pole is one of those three inland yellow dots, far from the coast.
              We’re located high up on an inland plateau, about 975 miles South of McMurdo Station. (Of course, we are,
              by definition, South of <em>literally everywhere</em>.)</p>
            <p>Remember, McMurdo is the United States’ main coastal logistics hub for Antarctic research, and it’s where I
              spent the first 4 months after my <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/mcmurdo-arrival">arrival on-continent</a>.</p>
            <p>In this post, I’ll quickly review McMurdo’s water infrastructure, before moving on to discuss water infrastructure
              at the South Pole.</p>

            <p>In order to appreciate the unique challenges of water management infrastructure at the inland South Pole
              Station, it’s worth taking some time first to understand water infrastructure at McMurdo, right on the coast.</p>
            <p>As a coastal station, McMurdo has year-round access to liquid seawater, right at the bottom of the hill,
              at the edge of town.
              Sometimes it’s buried under ice, but there’s always liquid water available below that, even in the middle
              of winter when the air temperature is a brisk -30°F.</p>
            <p>McMurdo brings in raw seawater using a series of pumps. The raw seawater intake infrastructure is located
              in building 179, the Seawater Intake Facility:</p>

            <p>The seawater is pumped up a series of insulated pipes:</p>

            <p>To safely transport water without it freezing in the pipes, we use thick, insulated pipes, with integrated
              heat trace cabling. Heat trace cabling is just controlled, high-resistance wiring that runs the length
              of the pipe. When electricity is passed through the wire, it heats up.
              The heat is trapped by the thick insulation, and it keeps the water in the pipe from freezing.
              This allows us to safely use above-ground pipes in -30°F weather:</p>

            <p>Seawater is used for two purposes in McMurdo. The first use of seawater is for the salt water aquarium in
              Crary Lab:</p>

            <p>The second use for seawater, is, of course, to produce potable (“domestic”) water for station operations.</p>
            <p>At McMurdo, seawater passes through several major steps. I’ll be brief here, because the real focus of this
              post is the South Pole. All of this processing takes place at the McMurdo water treatment plant:</p>
            <p>

                </picture>
                <em>McMurdo water plant.</em>
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>The first step is heating. Liquid seawater enters the plant at about 28°F. Since the water is salty, it remains
              liquid at a lower temperature than fresh water. Before we can remove the salt, we have to heat it. We use
              waste heat from the power plant to heat the water to about 37°F.</p>
            <p>The second step is filtering. Raw seawater can contain sediment, which must be removed prior to further
              treatment.</p>
            <p>The third step is desalination. McMurdo uses a reverse osmosis system for this. In short – the seawater
              is pressurized, then forced through a fine membrane. This process allows only pure water through. Salt,
              along with several other naturally-occurring minerals, are left behind. These are returned to the sea.</p>
            <p>The fourth step is “polishing”. Pure water, straight out of the reverse osmosis system, isn’t actually
              desirable. It can cause issues with distribution piping, and it is less than ideal for human consumption
              due to both aesthetic (taste) and nutritional reasons. Polishing involves the use of chemicals to adjust
              the hardness and pH levels, for optimal distribution. A small amount of chlorine is also added, which helps
              mitigate the negative effects of any contamination in the storage and distribution system.</p>
            <p>Finally, the water is sent to storage and distribution! McMurdo stores hundreds of thousands of gallons of
              treated water, ready
              for distribution. Remember, peak summer population can exceed 1,000 people. Water is also used for
              firefighting, so a significant amount of storage is required.</p>

            <p>That’s McMurdo! It’s not that weird. Cold, but not too cold. Take raw seawater, keep it from freezing,
              purify it, distribute it, use it. Take the wastewater, treat it, release it. Again, not that weird.</p>
            <p>Now – let’s talk about water at the South Pole.</p>
            <h2 id="south-pole-freshwater-infrastructure">South Pole Freshwater Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>At the South Pole, there is no liquid water source available. Pole is hundreds of miles from
              the coast, high up on an inland plateau, and it’s absurdly cold.</p>
            <p>

                <em>Vast, cold, barren nothingness, and no liquid water in sight.</em>
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>Luckily – that plateau is made up of several thousand feet
              of snow! It’s a lot of work, but we can melt this snow and produce potable water.</p>
            <p>This is no small feat of engineering, and the
              underlying physics means it’s an energy-intensive process. The deep-down snow at the South Pole is around -60°F.
              It takes 2.44 watt-hours (8.33 BTUs) of heat input to raise the temperature of 1 gallon of water by 1°F.
              Heating the equivalent of 1 gallon of water from -60°F to a reasonable liquid distribution temperature (50°F)
              means heating it up by a whopping <strong>110°F</strong>. That’s 268 watt-hours of raw energy
              required just to bring a single gallon of water up to distribution temperature!</p>
            <p>This is one of the reasons we’re restricted to <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/showering-at-the-south-pole">two-minute showers</a>.</p>
            <h2 id="supply">Supply</h2>
            <p>Water at the South Pole begins with a “Rodwell”, short for “Rodriguez Well”. The original design for
              the Rodwell comes from an engineer named Raul Rodriguez, who designed it for a camp in Greenland.</p>
            <p>The Rodwell is located below the Rodwell support building, which is located several hundred feet
              away from station. By “The Rodwell”, I should clarify that
              I’m referring to the <strong>current</strong> Rodwell. As I’ll discuss later, these don’t last forever. We’re on
              what is now officially called “Rodwell 3”. We’ve had more Rodwells than that in the history of the
              South Pole, but the naming convention began when Rodwell location planning was standardized. We have
              locations already planned out for several more Rodwells.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The basic operation of a Rodwell is straightforward. You drill a hole in the snow.
              You start pumping hot water into the hole. The hot water melts the snow, which pushes outward and forms
              an underground lake. You can pump liquid water out of the lake! As long as you keep adding heat, by
              recirculating hot water down into the hole, you can keep expanding the lake and keep pumping water
              out of it.</p>

            <p>Normally, water is pumped out of the Rodwell, and then pumped hundreds of feet toward station, to the main water
              treatment plant. Some of the water
              is taken for station use. The rest of the water passes through a series of heat exchangers in the water plant,
              before it is then pumped
              back to the Rodwell. This heated, recirculated water is used to keep the underground lake serviceable.</p>

            <p>Since the Rodwell is located several hundred feet from the water plant, we need backup systems
              to ensure that there is <em>always</em> a hot water supply to the Rodwell, even if something happened to the return
              piping between the water plant and Rodwell.</p>
            <p>For resiliency, the Rodwell support building itself has backup boilers and heat exchangers.
              It’s essential that we <em>never</em> lose
              the recirculated hot water loop down into the Rodwell, else we risk damaging it.
              Constant heat input to the system is a critical requirement for its continued operation.</p>

            <p>We use each Rodwell for several years. Once it gets too big (we’re talking <em>millions</em> of gallons),
              we stop pumping fresh water out of it, and
              we start over with a new one in a new location.
              The old one gets converted to be used for wastewater disposal – more on
              that part later.</p>
            <p>Much more fascinating historical documentation about Rodwells can be found
              on Bill Spindler’s <a href="https://www.southpolestation.com/trivia/rodwell/rodwell.html">South Pole Station</a>
              website.</p>
            <p>As discussed above, once water is pumped out of the Rodwell,
              it exits the Rodwell support building, and it enters into the ice tunnels below.</p>

            <p>When the water enters the treatment plant, it first passes through a series of limestone contactors. Limestone
              contactors are used to increase the pH of the water by adding minerals. This improves corrosion resistance
              and makes the water suitable for human consumption. Contactors can be brought online or taken offline as needed,
              depending on the amount of treatment needed to achieve desired target outcomes.</p>
            <p>Note that <strong>all</strong> water passes through the contactors, even water that will be recirculated back to the Rodwell.</p>

            <p>After the limestone contactors, the majority of the water is sent toward heat exchangers, which are used to heat up
              the water that will be sent back to the Rodwell. The Rodwell circulation loop uses the majority of the water that
              is pumped out of the Rodwell. Only a small portion is diverted for domestic use.</p>
            <p>The water is about 36°F when it is pumped out of
              the Rodwell, and it reaches about 42°F after it makes it all the way to the water plant and through the
              limestone contactors.</p>
            <p>Domestic water does not receive any direct supplemental heating further along in the process. Additional heat gains
              are due to ambient heat absorption from the water treatment plant, or due to heating along the insulated, heat-traced
              piping.</p>
            <p>Rodwell recirculation water, on the other hand, needs
              to be heated quite a bit, up to about 84°F. Remember, this water is pumped back
              down into the Rodwell, to maintain and expand the underground lake.</p>
            <p>Here you can see the heat exchanger infrastructure. Hot glycol is pumped in from the power plant next door.
              The heat exchangers place the hot glycol loop and water loop in close proximity, separated only by
              small layers of thermally-conductive metal. This allows for the efficient transfer of heat without the
              contents actually touching.</p>

            <p>Once the domestic water has passed through all of these treatment steps, it is stored in bulk,
              unpressurized tanks. There are two tanks, so one can be taken offline for maintenance. The tanks
              are several thousand gallons, and they provide a storage buffer to guard against scheduled or unscheduled
              interruptions in the Rodwell supply or treatment process.</p>

              for the distribution system. These pipes are insulated, because the beer can is not heated.</p>

            <p>Wastewater at Pole is handled <strong><em>much</em></strong> differently from wastewater at McMurdo!</p>
            <p>As a reminder, from my
              <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/wastewater-plant">McMurdo Wastewater Plant</a> post, wastewater at McMurdo goes through
              a full wastewater treatment process. Treated wastewater is discharged into the ocean, and solids are processed
              and sent back to the United States for disposal.</p>
            <p>At Pole, we use the old, spent Rodwells for storing wastewater. When a Rodwell has reached its
              maximum size, we stop drawing fresh water from it, and we convert it into wastewater storage. From then on,
              it is known as the “sewage outfall”.</p>
            <p>Raw sewage and other wastewater flows into the current sewage outfall via a network of sewage pipes. The
              wastewater is stored underground indefinitely. No treatment is performed on this wastewater before it is
              sent underground. There are millions of gallons of raw, untreated wastewater stored in outfalls beneath
              South Pole Station.</p>
            <p>As of this writing (June 2024), a wastewater treatment plant is not currently planned or budgeted
              for South Pole Station, although one has been discussed at various points throughout
              the history of South Pole Station. A wastewater treatment plant does appear as a recommendation in the
              <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/documents/SPSMP_Fed%20Reg%20Draft_NSF.pdf">South Pole Station Master Plan Draft 2024</a>
              (<strong>32 MB PDF</strong>) document on the NSF website.</p>
            <p>Disposing of raw sewage by injecting it beneath the ice is permitted under the
              <a href="https://www.ats.aq/e/waste.html">Antarctic Treaty System</a>,
              which is codified in US law under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/part-671#p-671.12(f)">45 CFR § 671.12(f)</a>.</p>
            <p>As I stated in my post about <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/south-pole-electrical-infrastructure">South Pole Electrical Infrastructure</a>,
              it is my sincere hope that we continue working, with urgency, to reduce the environmental footprint of US Antarctic
              research.</p>
            <p>Wastewater from the elevated station flows from domestic drains and collects in holding pits. There are two main
              holding pits in the elevated station.</p>
            <p>The purpose of these is twofold: First, these pits provide a temporary storage buffer, allowing
              use of plumbing fixtures within the station during periods of maintenance on the discharge piping or
              sewer outfall.</p>
            <p>Second, wastewater can be collected in these pits until they are full, and then the wastewater can be
              force discharged at a high flow rate.
              Discharging at a high flow rate allows for efficient and more complete carrying of suspended solids. If waste
              were discharged all the way to the sewer outfall at the rate it was produced, the system would suffer from
              blockages caused by solids that settled out in transit.</p>
            <p>The first pit, for the “B” pod, is also co-located with our emergency water purification
              infrastructure, inside the Emergency Power Plant (EPP).
              This is part of the “lifeboat”, a wing of the station with redundant infrastructure that could
              function on its own in case the rest of the station were compromised.</p>
            <p>Here you can see the wastewater holding pit, as well as some of the emergency water purification equipment.</p>
            <p>

              </a>
            </p>
            <p>This wastewater pit collects all wastewater via gravity from the “B” pod.
              It normally discharges to the main sewage/wastewater outfall. However, in the event that this
              was compromised, it can also discharge to a much smaller emergency outfall. This ensures continuity of
              wastewater disposal in the event of an issue with the primary wastewater outfall.</p>
            <p>The emergency water purification infrastructure here can produce potable, domestic water by melting snow. A
              portable snowmelter can be set up just outside, with heat provided by a glycol loop.</p>
            <p>Up next is the “A” pod wastewater pit. This one is located inside a large mechanical room on the 1st floor
              of the “A” pod. Wastewater collects here via gravity from all fixtures in the “A” pod. It also discharges
              to the main outfall.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Once the pits are full, they automatically discharge to the sewer outfall. This follows roughly the same
              path as the domestic water supply piping. The pipes exit the station, go down the beer can,
              and travel through the ice tunnels, until they reach the current sewer outfall.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Of course, not every building is connected to the plumbing system. In fact, at South Pole, only the elevated
              station and the power plant arch have running water and wastewater connections. The outbuildings (IceCube,
              MAPO, DSL, ARO, etc) are too far away, and so far it hasn’t been cost-effective to connect them.</p>
            <p>For folks working outside away from station, there are a variety of options.</p>
            <p>During the summer, when the population is high, we have porta-potties strategically located
              around campus:</p>

            </p>
            <p>Without a permanent sewer connection, waste from porta-potties must eventually be carried back to station once
              the porta-potties fill up.</p>
            <p>Permanent outbuildings also often have an established solution for handling human waste from workers.
              These solutions range from simple buckets, to permanently-installed dry toilets with
              removable storage bins.</p>
            <p>For work that takes you away from station, without access to toilet facilities, many personnel also carry
              portable bottles. These are a formal item, provided by USAP, and marked for their intended use.
              They are 32oz “HDPE” Nalgene bottles.</p>
            <p>You can obtain one at the beginning of your season,
              and it’s your responsibility to return it, thoroughly cleaned and sanitized, before you depart. These are often used
              by personnel who travel to deep field locations, but they are also helpful for any situation where you
              may find yourself away from permanent facilities.</p>
            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>And there you have it – a brief tour of South Pole water and wastewater infrastructure!</p>
            <p>Much like <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/south-pole-electrical-infrastructure">South Pole Electrical Infrastructure</a>, the
              infrastructure that makes all this possible is generally hidden from view. From an average user’s perspective,
              living and working in the elevated station, everything functions pretty much the way you’d expect it to.</p>
            <p>When you’re washing dishes in a windowless, heated room,
              and you turn on the faucet to fill the sink, it’s easy to forget
              all the work going on behind the scenes to make all this happen.</p>
            <p>But venture out to the Rodwell in the middle of winter, when it’s negative 100°F, and you’ll quickly
              be reminded of the forces we’re up against.</p>
            <p>From cold, to wind, to relentlessly accumulating snow, to the
              long, long supply chains for engineering expertise and spare parts, it’s a challenge to make things
              work at Pole. Our water and wastewater systems are critical infrastructure that enable
              humans to live at the bottom of the world.</p>
