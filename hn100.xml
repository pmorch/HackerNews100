<p dir="auto">Blue95 is a modern and lightweight desktop experience that is reminiscent of a bygone era of computing.
Based on Fedora Atomic Xfce with the <a href="https://github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95">Chicago95</a> theme.</p>

<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">Live CD is a new feature and is still in testing.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto">We are now creating a <a href="https://pub-969fbc86b5f24e4d81c6d022e8fd8dde.r2.dev/blue95-live-latest.iso" rel="nofollow">Live ISO</a> that can be used to boot into a Blue95 live environment. Test it out without needing to install anything.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that the included installer is an alpha version and it is recommended to instead install Blue95 via the other methods listed below.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">We are currently having issues with our installer ISOs. The current recommended installation path is though rebasing from a different Fedora Atomic desktop, preferably from an Xfce-based image such as <a href="https://github.com/winblues/vauxite">winblues/vauxite</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">After installing vauixite, you can rebase directly to this image with:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/winblues/blue95:latest"><pre><code>rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/winblues/blue95:latest

<p dir="auto">If you are currently using an atomic desktop, you can rebase to the latest blue95 image.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/winblues/blue95:latest"><pre><code>rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/winblues/blue95:latest
</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>Reboot and then rebase to the signed image, like so:
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/winblues/blue95:latest"><pre><code>rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/winblues/blue95:latest
</code></pre></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">It is recommended to create a new user after rebasing.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Project Goals</h2><a id="user-content-project-goals" aria-label="Permalink: Project Goals" href="#project-goals"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Match upstream Fedora Xfce in terms of core system components and update schedule.</li>

<p>There are lots of laws which people discuss when talking about development. This repository is a reference and overview of some of the most common ones. Please share and submit PRs!</p>
<p>‚ùó: This repo contains an explanation of some laws, principles and patterns, but does not <em>advocate</em> for any of them. Whether they should be applied will always be a matter of debate, and greatly dependent on what you are working on.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)">1% Rule on Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>The 90-9-1 principle suggests that within an internet community such as a wiki, 90% of participants only consume content, 9% edit or modify content and 1% of participants add content.</p>
<p>Real-world examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 2014 study of four digital health social networks found the top 1% created 73% of posts, the next 9% accounted for an average of ~25% and the remaining 90% accounted for an average of 2% (<a href="https://www.jmir.org/2014/2/e33/">Reference</a>)</li>

        <h2 id="amdahls-law">Amdahl's Law</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl's Law on Wikipedia</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amdahl's Law is a formula which shows the <em>potential speedup</em> of a computational task which can be achieved by increasing the resources of a system. Normally used in parallel computing, it can predict the actual benefit of increasing the number of processors, which is limited by the parallelisability of the program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Best illustrated with an example. If a program is made up of two parts, part A, which must be executed by a single processor, and part B, which can be parallelised, then we see that adding multiple processors to the system executing the program can only have a limited benefit. It can potentially greatly improve the speed of part B - but the speed of part A will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows some examples of potential improvements in speed:</p>
<p><img width="480px" alt="Diagram: Amdahl's Law" src="https://hacker-laws.com/images/amdahls_law.png"></p>
<p><em>(Image Reference: By Daniels219 at English Wikipedia, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AmdahlsLaw.svg)</em></p>
<p>As can be seen, even a program which is 50% parallelisable will benefit very little beyond 10 processing units, whereas a program which is 95% parallelisable can still achieve significant speed improvements with over a thousand processing units.</p>
<p>As <a href="#moores-law">Moore's Law</a> slows, and the acceleration of individual processor speed slows, parallelisation is key to improving performance. Graphics programming is an excellent example - with modern Shader based computing, individual pixels or fragments can be rendered in parallel - this is why modern graphics cards often have many thousands of processing cores (GPUs or Shader Units).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">The Broken Windows Theory on Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>The Broken Windows Theory suggests that visible signs of crime (or lack of care of an environment) lead to further and more serious crimes (or further deterioration of the environment).</p>
<p>This theory has been applied to software development, suggesting that poor quality code (or <a href="#TODO">Technical Debt</a>) can lead to a perception that efforts to improve quality may be ignored or undervalued, thus leading to further poor quality code. This effect cascades leading to a great decrease in quality over time.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law">Brooks' Law on Wikipedia</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adding human resources to a late software development project makes it later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This law suggests that in many cases, attempting to accelerate the delivery of a project which is already late, by adding more people, will make the delivery even later. Brooks is clear that this is an over-simplification, however, the general reasoning is that given the ramp-up time of new resources and the communication overheads, in the immediate short-term velocity decreases. Also, many tasks may not be divisible, i.e. easily distributed between more resources, meaning the potential velocity increase is also lower.</p>
<p>The common phrase in delivery "Nine women can't make a baby in one month" relates to Brooks' Law, in particular, the fact that some kinds of work are not divisible or parallelisable.</p>

      <section id="cap-theorem-(brewer's-theorem)">
        <h2 id="cap-theorem-brewers-theorem">CAP Theorem (Brewer's Theorem)</h2>
<p>The CAP Theorem (defined by Eric Brewer) states that for a distributed data store only two out of the following three guarantees (at most) can be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistency: when reading data, every request receives the <em>most recent</em> data or an error is returned</li>
<li>Availability: when reading data, every request receives <em>a non error response</em>, without the guarantee that it is the <em>most recent</em> data</li>
<li>Partition Tolerance: when an arbitrary number of network requests between nodes fail, the system continues to operate as expected</li>
</ul>
<p>The core of the reasoning is as follows. It is impossible to guarantee that a network partition will not occur (see <a href="#the-fallacies-of-distributed-computing">The Fallacies of Distributed Computing</a>). Therefore in the case of a partition we can either cancel the operation (increasing consistency and decreasing availability) or proceed (increasing availability but decreasing consistency).</p>
<p>The name comes from the first letters of the guarantees (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance). Note that it is very important to be aware that this does <em>not</em> relate to <a href="#TODO"><em>ACID</em></a>, which has a different definition of consistency. More recently, <a href="#TODO">PACELC</a> theorem has been developed which adds constraints for latency and consistency when the network is <em>not</em> partitioned (i.e. when the system is operating as expected).</p>
<p>Most modern database platforms acknowledge this theorem implicitly by offering the user of the database the option to choose between whether they want a highly available operation (which might include a 'dirty read') or a highly consistent operation (for example a 'quorum acknowledged write').</p>
<p>Real world examples:</p>

<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/inside-cloud-spanner-and-the-cap-theorem">Inside Google Cloud Spanner and the CAP Theorem</a> - Goes into the details of how Cloud Spanner works, which appears at first to seem like a platform which has <em>all</em> of the guarantees of CAP, but under the hood is essentially a CP system.</li>

- When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, they are almost certainly right. When they state that something is impossible, they are very probably wrong.
- The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
- Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</p>

<p>This law suggests that the technical boundaries of a system will reflect the structure of the organisation. It is commonly referred to when looking at organisation improvements, Conway's Law suggests that if an organisation is structured into many small, disconnected units, the software it produces will be. If an organisation is built more around 'verticals' which are oriented around features or services, the software systems will also reflect this.</p>

<p>According to Steven McGeady, Ward Cunningham advised him in the early 1980s: "The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, it's to post the wrong answer." McGeady dubbed this Cunningham's law, though Cunningham denies ownership calling it a "misquote." Although originally referring to interactions on Usenet, the law has been used to describe how other online communities work (e.g., Wikipedia, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar's Number on Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>"Dunbar's number is a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships‚Äî relationships in which an individual knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person." There is some disagreement to the exact number. "... [Dunbar] proposed that humans can comfortably maintain only 150 stable relationships." He put the number into a more social context, "the number of people you would not feel embarrassed about joining uninvited for a drink if you happened to bump into them in a bar." Estimates for the number generally lay between 100 and 250.</p>
<p>Like stable relationships between individuals, a developer's relationship with a codebase takes effort to maintain. When faced with large complicated projects, or ownership of many projects, we lean on convention, policy, and modeled procedure to scale. Dunbar's number is not only important to keep in mind as an office grows, but also when setting the scope for team efforts or deciding when a system should invest in tooling to assist in modeling and automating logistical overhead. Putting the number into an engineering context, it is the number of projects (or normalized complexity of a single project) for which you would feel confident in joining an on-call rotation to support.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you're incompetent, you can't know you're incompetent... The skills you need to produce a right answer are exactly the skills you need to recognize what a right answer is.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dunning">David Dunning</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect is a theoretical cognitive bias which was described by David Dunning and Justin Kruger in a 1999 psychological study and paper. The study suggests that people with a low level of ability at a task are likely to overestimate their ability of the task. The proposed reason for this bias is that a sufficient <em>awareness</em> of the complexity of a problem or domain is required for a person to be able to make an informed opinion of their capability to work in that domain.</p>
<p>The Dunning-Kruger effect has sometimes been used to describe a related, but not necessarily implied effect which could be described as "The less a person understands a domain, the more they are likely to believe they can easily solve problems in that domain, as they are more likely to see the domain as <em>simple</em>". This more general effect is highly relevant in technology. It would suggest that people who are less familiar with a domain, such as non-technical team members or less experienced team members, are more likely to <em>underestimate</em> the effort required to solve a problem in this space.</p>
<p>As a person's understanding and experience in a domain grows, they may well encounter another effect, which is that they tend to <em>overestimate</em> the ability of <em>others</em> or <em>underestimate</em> their own ability, as they are have become so experienced in the domain. In all cases these effects are <em>cognitive biases</em>. As with any bias, an understanding that it may be present will often be sufficient to help avoid the challenges ‚Äî as when there is awareness of a bias, more inputs and opinions can be included to attempt to eliminate these biases. A closely related bias is that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority">Illusory superiority</a>.</p>

Initially Graham had been critical of Apple challenging a request to create a 'backdoor', which he saw as necessary to investigate potential terrorist plots. However, by Graham's own admission, as he learned more about the technical complexity of the domain, he realised that he had assumed it to be far more simple than he had realised, and that such a backdoor could have serious negative consequences. This could potentially be considered an example of the Dunning-Kruger effect - a cyber-security expert would likely understand immediately how such a backdoor could be exploited, as they have deep understanding of the domain, a layperson might assume that phone security is more similar to <em>physical security</em> where the practice of having a 'master key' for law enforcement is possible, but this analogy does not apply sufficiently well to describe modern encryption in cyber-security. </li>

<p>Fitts' law predicts that the time required to move to a target area is a function of the distance to the target divided by the width of the target.</p>

<p>The consequences of this law dictate that when designing UX or UI, interactive elements should be as large as possible and the distance between the users attention area and interactive element should be as small as possible. This has consequences on design, such as grouping tasks that are commonly used with one another close.</p>
<p>It also formalises the concept of 'magic corners', the corners of the screen to which a user can 'sweep' their mouse to easily hit - which is where key UI elements can be placed. The Windows Start button is in a magic corner, making it easy to select, and as an interesting contrast, the MacOS 'close window' button is <em>not</em> in a magic corner, making it hard to hit by mistake.</p>

- Developer performance score indicated by the number of lines committed leads to unjustifiably bloated codebase.</p>

<p>This law only applies when the number of options is <em>ordered</em>, for example, alphabetically.

<p>The Hype Cycle is a visual representation of the excitement and development of technology over time, originally produced by Gartner. It is best shown with a visual:</p>

<p>In short, this cycle suggests that there is typically a burst of excitement around new technology and its potential impact. Teams often jump into these technologies quickly, and sometimes find themselves disappointed with the results. This might be because the technology is not yet mature enough, or real-world applications are not yet fully realised. After a certain amount of time, the capabilities of the technology increase and practical opportunities to use it increase, and teams can finally become productive. Roy Amara's quote sums this up most succinctly - "We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate in the long run".</p>

<p>Hyrum's Law states that when you have a <em>large enough number of consumers</em> of an API, all behaviours of the API (even those not defined as part of a public contract) will eventually come to be depended on by someone. A trivial example may be non-functional elements such as the response time of an API. A more subtle example might be consumers who are relying on applying a regex to an error message to determine the <em>type</em> of error of an API. Even if the public contract of the API states nothing about the contents of the message, indicating users should use an associated error code, <em>some</em> users may use the message, and changing the message essentially breaks the API for those users.</p>

<p>In its original context, this Law was based on studies of bureaucracies. It may be pessimistically applied to software development initiatives, the theory being that teams will be inefficient until deadlines near, then rush to complete work by the deadline, thus making the actual deadline somewhat arbitrary.</p>
<p>If this law were combined with <a href="#hofstadters-law">Hofstadter's Law</a>, an even more pessimistic viewpoint is reached - work will expand to fill the time available for its completion and <em>still take longer than expected</em>.</p>

<p>This law states that there is a certain amount of complexity in a system which cannot be reduced.</p>
<p>Some complexity in a system is 'inadvertent'. It is a consequence of poor structure, mistakes, or just bad modeling of a problem to solve. Inadvertent complexity can be reduced (or eliminated). However, some complexity is 'intrinsic' as a consequence of the complexity inherent in the problem being solved. This complexity can be moved, but not eliminated.</p>
<p>One interesting element to this law is the suggestion that even by simplifying the entire system, the intrinsic complexity is not reduced, it is <em>moved to the user</em>, who must behave in a more complex way.</p>

<p>The Law of Demeter, also known as "The Principle of Least Knowledge" is a principle for software design, particularly relevant in object orientated languages.</p>
<p>It states that a unit of software should talk only to its immediate collaborators. An object <code>A</code> with a reference to object <code>B</code> can call its methods, but if <code>B</code> has a reference to object <code>C</code>, <code>A</code> should not call <code>C</code>s methods. So, if <code>C</code> has a <code>doThing()</code> method, <code>A</code> should not invoke it directly; <code>B.getC().doThis()</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">The Law of Leaky Abstractions on Joel on Software</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/spolsky">Joel Spolsky</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This law states that abstractions, which are generally used in computing to simplify working with complicated systems, will in certain situations 'leak' elements of the underlying system, this making the abstraction behave in an unexpected way.</p>
<p>An example might be loading a file and reading its contents. The file system APIs are an <em>abstraction</em> of the lower level kernel systems, which are themselves an abstraction over the physical processes relating to changing data on a magnetic platter (or flash memory for an SSD). In most cases, the abstraction of treating a file like a stream of binary data will work. However, for a magnetic drive, reading data sequentially will be <em>significantly</em> faster than random access (due to increased overhead of page faults), but for an SSD drive, this overhead will not be present. Underlying details will need to be understood to deal with this case (for example, database index files are structured to reduce the overhead of random access), the abstraction 'leaks' implementation details the developer may need to be aware of.</p>
<p>The example above can become more complex when <em>more</em> abstractions are introduced. The Linux operating system allows files to be accessed over a network but represented locally as 'normal' files. This abstraction will 'leak' if there are network failures. If a developer treats these files as 'normal' files, without considering the fact that they may be subject to network latency and failures, the solutions will be buggy.</p>
<p>The article describing the law suggests that an over-reliance on abstractions, combined with a poor understanding of the underlying processes, actually makes dealing with the problem at hand <em>more</em> complex in some cases.</p>

<p>This law suggests that groups will give far more time and attention to trivial or cosmetic issues rather than serious and substantial ones.</p>
<p>The common fictional example used is that of a committee approving plans for nuclear power plant, who spend the majority of their time discussing the structure of the bike shed, rather than the far more important design for the power plant itself. It can be difficult to give valuable input on discussions about very large, complex topics without a high degree of subject matter expertise or preparation. However, people want to be seen to be contributing valuable input. Hence a tendency to focus too much time on small details, which can be reasoned about easily, but are not necessarily of particular importance.</p>
<p>The fictional example above led to the usage of the term 'Bike Shedding' as an expression for wasting time on trivial details. A related term is '<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">Yak Shaving</a>,' which connotes a seemingly irrelevant activity that is part of a long chain of prerequisites to the main task.</p>

<p>Members of the organisation have described that the actual meaning of these groups changes, evolves and is an on-going experiment. The fact that the model is a <em>process in motion</em>, rather than a fixed model continues to lead to varying interpretations of the structure, which may be based on presentations given by employees at conferences. This means 'snapshots' may be 're-packaged' by third parties as a <em>fixed structure</em>, with the fact that the model is dynamic being lost.</p>

<p>This rule suggests that regardless of the size of the company, teams should be small enough to be fed by two pizzas. Attributed to Jeff Bezos and Amazon, this belief suggests that large teams are inherently inefficient. This is supported by the fact that as the team size increases linearly, the links between people increases quadratically; thus the cost of coordinating and communicating also grows quadratically. If this cost of coordination is essentially overhead, then smaller teams should be preferred.</p>
<p>The number of links between people can be expressed as <code>n(n-1)/2</code> where n = number of people.</p>

<p>In the 1940s American-Romanian engineer Dr. Joseph Juran, who is widely credited with being the father of quality control, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_M._Juran">began to apply the Pareto principle to quality issues</a>.</p>
<p>This principle is also known as: The 80/20 Rule, The Law of the Vital Few, and The Principle of Factor Sparsity.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The Shirky Principle suggests that complex solutions - a company, an industry, or a technology - can become so focused on the problem that they are solving, that they can inadvertently perpetuate the problem itself. This may be deliberate (a company striving to find new nuances to a problem which justify continued development of a solution), or inadvertent (being unable or unwilling to accept or build a solution which solves the problem completely or obviates it).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People in a hierarchy tend to rise to their "level of incompetence".</p>
<p><em>Laurence J. Peter</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A management concept developed by Laurence J. Peter, the Peter Principle observes that people who are good at their jobs are promoted, until they reach a level where they are no longer successful (their "level of incompetence"). At this point, as they are more senior, they are less likely to be removed from the organisation (unless they perform spectacularly badly) and will continue to reside in a role which they have few intrinsic skills at, as their original skills which made them successful are not necessarily the skills required for their new jobs.</p>
<p>This is of particular interest to engineers - who initially start out in deeply technical roles, but often have a career path which leads to <em>managing</em> other engineers - which requires a fundamentally different skill set.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Often applied in server application development, this principle states that what you send to others should be as minimal and conformant as possible, but you should aim to allow non-conformant input if it can be processed.</p>
<p>The goal of this principle is to build systems which are robust, as they can handle poorly formed input if the intent can still be understood. However, there are potentially security implications of accepting malformed input, particularly if the processing of such input is not well tested. These implications and other issues are described by Eric Allman in <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1999945">The Robustness Principle Reconsidered</a>.</p>
<p>Allowing non-conformant input, in time, may undermine the ability of protocols to evolve as implementors will eventually rely on this liberality to build their features.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every module or class should have a single responsibility only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first of the '<a href="#solid">SOLID</a>' principles. This principle suggests that modules or classes should do one thing and one thing only. In more practical terms, this means that a single, small change to a feature of a program should require a change in one component only. For example, changing how a password is validated for complexity should require a change in only one part of the program.</p>
<p>Theoretically, this should make the code more robust, and easier to change. Knowing that a component being changed has a single responsibility only means that <em>testing</em> that change should be easier. Using the earlier example, changing the password complexity component should only be able to affect the features which relate to password complexity. It can be much more difficult to reason about the impact of a change to a component which has many responsibilities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Entities should be open for extension and closed for modification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second of the '<a href="#solid">SOLID</a>' principles. This principle states that entities (which could be classes, modules, functions and so on) should be able to have their behaviour <em>extended</em>, but that their <em>existing</em> behaviour should not be able to be modified.</p>
<p>As a hypothetical example, imagine a module which is able to turn a Markdown document into HTML. Now imagine there is a new syntax added to the Markdown specification, which adds support for mathematical equations. The module should be <em>open to extension</em> to implement the new mathematics syntax. However, existing syntax implementations (like paragraphs, bullets, etc) should be <em>closed for modification</em>. They already work, we don't want people to change them.</p>
<p>This principle has particular relevance for object-oriented programming, where we may design objects to be easily extended, but would avoid designing objects which can have their existing behaviour changed in unexpected ways.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It should be possible to replace a type with a subtype, without breaking the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The third of the '<a href="#solid">SOLID</a>' principles. This principle states that if a component relies on a type, then it should be able to use subtypes of that type, without the system failing or having to know the details of what that subtype is.</p>
<p>As an example, imagine we have a method which reads an XML document from a structure which represents a file. If the method uses a base type 'file', then anything which derives from 'file' should be usable in the function. If 'file' supports seeking in reverse, and the XML parser uses that function, but the derived type 'network file' fails when reverse seeking is attempted, then the 'network file' would be violating the principle.</p>
<p>This principle has particular relevance for object-oriented programming, where type hierarchies must be modeled carefully to avoid confusing users of a system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fourth of the '<a href="#solid">SOLID</a>' principles. This principle states that consumers of a component should not depend on functions of that component which it doesn't actually use.</p>
<p>As an example, imagine we have a method which reads an XML document from a structure which represents a file. It only needs to read bytes, move forwards or move backwards in the file. If this method needs to be updated because an unrelated feature of the file structure changes (such as an update to the permissions model used to represent file security), then the principle has been invalidated. It would be better for the file to implement a 'seekable-stream' interface, and for the XML reader to use that.</p>
<p>This principle has particular relevance for object-oriented programming, where interfaces, hierarchies and abstract types are used to <a href="#todo">minimise the coupling</a> between different components. <a href="#todo">Duck typing</a> is a methodology which enforces this principle by eliminating explicit interfaces.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>High-level modules should not be dependent on low-level implementations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fifth of the '<a href="#solid">SOLID</a>' principles. This principle states that higher-level orchestrating components should not have to know the details of their dependencies.</p>
<p>As an example, imagine we have a program which read metadata from a website. We would assume that the main component would have to know about a component to download the webpage content, then a component which can read the metadata. If we were to take dependency inversion into account, the main component would depend only on an abstract component which can fetch byte data, and then an abstract component which would be able to read metadata from a byte stream. The main component would not know about TCP/IP, HTTP, HTML, etc.</p>
<p>This principle is complex, as it can seem to 'invert' the expected dependencies of a system (hence the name). In practice, it also means that a separate orchestrating component must ensure the correct implementations of abstract types are used (e.g. in the previous example, <em>something</em> must still provide the metadata reader component a HTTP file downloader and HTML meta tag reader). This then touches on patterns such as <a href="#todo">Inversion of Control</a> and <a href="#todo">Dependency Injection</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Keep it simple, stupid</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.  Originating in the U.S. Navy in 1960, the phrase has been associated with aircraft engineer Kelly Johnson.</p>
<p>The principle is best exemplified by the story of Johnson handing a team of design engineers a handful of tools, with the challenge that the jet aircraft they were designing must be repairable by an average mechanic in the field under combat conditions with only these tools. Hence, the "stupid" refers to the relationship between the way things break and the sophistication of the tools available to repair them, not the capabilities of the engineers themselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing">The Fallacies of Distributed Computing on Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Also known as <em>Fallacies of Networked Computing</em>, the Fallacies are a list of conjectures (or beliefs) about distributed computing, which can lead to failures in software development. The assumptions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The network is reliable</li>
<li>Latency is zero</li>
<li>Bandwidth is infinite</li>
<li>The network is secure</li>
<li>Topology doesn't change</li>
<li>There is one administrator</li>
<li>Transport cost is zero</li>
<li>The network is homogeneous</li>
</ul>
<p>The first four items were listed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy">Bill Joy</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/aka_pugs">Tom Lyon</a> around 1991 and first classified by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling">James Gosling</a> as the "Fallacies of Networked Computing". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Peter_Deutsch">L. Peter Deutsch</a> added the 5th, 6th and 7th fallacies. In the late 90's Gosling added the 8th fallacy.</p>
<p>The group was inspired by what was happening at the time inside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a>.</p>
<p>These fallacies should be considered carefully when designing code which is resilient; assuming any of these fallacies can lead to flawed logic which fails to deal with the realities and complexities of distributed systems.</p>

<p>People are part of the system. The design should match the user's experience, expectations, and mental models.</p>

<p>This principle proposes that systems and interfaces should be designed in a way that features and functionality is easily discovered and matches users expectations. Features that 'surprise' users should be discouraged in favour of features that can be intuitively reasoned about based on existing patterns and practices.</p>
<p>Many examples are present in user interfaces, such as a 'pull down' gesture on a mobile appliation to refresh content. Another example would be command line tools, where many standards exist for how parameters are named, common parameters that should be available and so on.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
  

  
  <p data-date="2025-03-27T00:00:00">written on Thursday, March 27, 2025</p>
  

  <p>Three years ago I shared the <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2022/1/7/as-any-hack/">As-Any Hack</a> on
this blog.  That hack is a way to get upcasting to supertraits working on
stable Rust.  To refresh your memory, the goal was to make something like
this work:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[derive(Debug)]</span><span></span>
<span>struct</span> <span>AnyBox</span><span>(</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>dyn</span><span> </span><span>DebugAny</span><span>&gt;</span><span>);</span><span></span>

<span>trait</span><span> </span><span>DebugAny</span>: <span>Any</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>Debug</span><span> </span><span>{}</span><span></span>

<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span>: <span>Any</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>Debug</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>static</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>DebugAny</span><span> </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>T</span><span> </span><span>{}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>The problem? Even though <cite>DebugAny</cite> inherits from <cite>Any</cite>, Rust wouldn't let you
use methods from <cite>Any</cite> on a <cite>dyn DebugAny</cite>.  So while you could call
<cite>DebugAny</cite> methods just fine, trying to use <cite>downcast_ref</cite> from <cite>Any</cite> (the
reason to use Any in the first place) would fail:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>any_box</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>AnyBox</span><span>(</span><span>Box</span>::<span>new</span><span>(</span><span>42</span><span>i32</span><span>));</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>dbg!</span><span>(</span><span>any_box</span><span>.</span><span>0.</span><span>downcast_ref</span>::<span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>());</span><span>  </span><span>// Compile error</span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>The same would happen if we tried to cast it into an <cite>&amp;dyn Any</cite>?  A
compile error again:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>any_box</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>AnyBox</span><span>(</span><span>Box</span>::<span>new</span><span>(</span><span>42</span><span>i32</span><span>));</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>any</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>&amp;*</span><span>any_box</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>dyn</span><span> </span><span>Any</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>dbg!</span><span>(</span><span>any</span><span>.</span><span>downcast_ref</span>::<span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>());</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>But there is good news!  As of Rust 1.86, this is finally fixed. The cast
now works:</p>
<pre>[src/main.rs:14:5] any.downcast_ref::&lt;i32&gt;() = Some(
    42,
)
</pre>
<p>At the time of writing, this fix is in the beta channel, but stable
release is just around the corner.  That means a lot of old hacks can
finally be retired.  At least once your MSRV moves up.</p>
<p>Thank you so much to everyone who <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65991">worked on this</a> to make it work!</p>

				<h3>from the <i>found-the-campus-free-speech-crisis</i> dept</h3>
				


				<p>For years, we‚Äôve been hearing breathless warnings about a ‚Äúcampus free speech crisis‚Äù from self-proclaimed free speech warriors. Their evidence? College students doing what college students have done for generations: protesting speakers they disagree with, challenging institutional policies, and yes, sometimes attempting to create heckler‚Äôs vetoes.</p>
<p>This kind of campus activism ‚Äî while occasionally messy and uncomfortable ‚Äî has been a feature of American higher education since the 1960s. It‚Äôs how young people learn to engage with ideas and exercise their own speech rights. Sometimes that activism is silly and sometimes it‚Äôs righteous. Often it‚Äôs somewhere in between, but it‚Äôs kind of a part of being a college student, and learning what you believe in.</p>
<p>But now we face an <em>actual</em> free speech crisis on campus that goes beyond just speech. It‚Äôs an attack on personal freedoms, due process, and liberty. The federal government isn‚Äôt just pressuring universities over speech ‚Äî it‚Äôs <strong>literally disappearing students for their political expression</strong>. If you support actual free speech, now is the time to speak up.</p>
<p>The latest example of this authoritarian overreach is particularly chilling: Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish PhD student at Tufts who was here legally on a student visa, <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/2025-03-26/tufts-international-graduate-student-taken-into-ice-custody">was abducted by masked agents</a> in broad daylight. She was disappeared without due process or explanation ‚Äî only later did we learn she had been renditioned to a detention center in Louisiana.</p>
<p>The video of her kidnapping (because that‚Äôs what it was) is terrifying enough:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YGDVKBdq3Gw?si=GwMrd-S7oC94zfDS" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you listen, you hear her quite understandably surprised reaction with a scream, and then she asks to call the police, only to be told ‚Äúwe‚Äôre the police.‚Äù None of them are in uniforms. Most of them are masked.</p>
<p>Her supposed crime? A year ago, she co-authored an op-ed in The Tufts Daily <a href="https://www.tuftsdaily.com/article/2024/03/4ftk27sm6jkj">criticizing her university administration‚Äôs stance</a> on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Not advocating violence. Not supporting terrorism. Not even criticizing the U.S. government. Just exercising core First Amendment rights by publishing criticism of her own university‚Äôs policies in a student newspaper.</p>
<p>The government has attempted to justify similar renditions (and there is a growing list of victims) by falsely painting targets as ‚Äúterrorist supporters‚Äù ‚Äî a dangerous conflation of political speech supporting Palestinian rights with support for terrorism. But even those cases typically involved people involved in public protests, which are themselves constitutionally protected activities. This case goes even further: disappearing someone over an innocuous piece of student journalism published a year ago.</p>
<p>Everyone should be alarmed. <em>Everyone</em> should be demanding that she (and others) be released and that ICE and DHS stop this horrifying and unconscionable practice. <em>Everyone</em> should be demanding that Trump and Marco Rubio and Kristi Noem stop this Gestapo bullshit.</p>
<p>Even if ‚Äî <em>especially</em> if ‚Äî you disagree with her views on Israel and Palestine. This isn‚Äôt about that. This is about the very concept of freedom. The rights everyone ‚Äî even visitors ‚Äî are supposed to have in this country. The right to speak your mind, even if (especially if!) it is opposed to those in power. The right to walk down a street without being kidnapped. The right to due process.</p>
<p>If the government genuinely believed Ozturk had violated immigration law or her visa terms (she hadn‚Äôt), there are established legal procedures to address such issues. Instead, they chose to send masked goons to disappear her without warning or due process ‚Äî a chilling message to every other international student that their supposed right to express political opinions comes with the risk of rendition.</p>
<p>And, of course, the implied threat is that this won‚Äôt stop at international students.</p>
<p>But the Trump administration believes not in fundamental rights. It only believes in the cowardly authoritarian displays of theatrical power. Because they are weak and insecure. They are so frightened by a random college student op-ed or a protest, they are taking to disappearing people with no due process for their speech.</p>
<p>This won‚Äôt stop unless everyone speaks up and demands that the government respect the rights of everyone. These are bullying and intimidation tactics of weak insecure bullies, who know they cannot win in the marketplace of ideas. They are scared and pathetic, knowing that their beliefs are bad, and that the public doesn‚Äôt support them. Thus, their only response is an impotent rage, an attempt to replace respect and fair treatment with authoritarian tactics in hopes of intimidating people into silence and capitulation.</p>
<p>These are scary times, but people need to stop cowering. They need to speak up. They need to show up. They need to say that this is not the America any of us were taught to believe in. This is not the America of freedom and rights.</p>
<p>This is a desecration of the high (and often unmet) ideals of what America is supposed to be striving for. This is spitting on the fundamental concepts of the American project.</p>
<p>And where are all those self-proclaimed defenders of campus free speech now? The same voices who treated student protesters as an existential threat to academic freedom are conspicuously silent as government agents literally kidnap students for their political expression. Their silence exposes their previous concerns as purely performative.</p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt just about free speech anymore ‚Äî it‚Äôs about whether we‚Äôll allow the government to normalize disappearing people for their political views. Everyone who claims to care about constitutional rights and academic freedom needs to speak up now. Because those who remain silent in the face of such clear authoritarian overreach are complicit.</p>

<h3>Raph Levien, March 29, 2025</h3>
<p>Seven years ago I wrote a blog post <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/simd/2018/10/19/fearless-simd.html">Towards fearless SIMD</a>, outlining a vision for Rust as a compelling language for writing fast SIMD programs.
Where are we now?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the present-day experience of writing SIMD in Rust is still pretty rough, though there has been progress, and there are promising efforts underway.
As in the previous post, this post will outline a possible vision.</p>
<p>Up to now, Linebender projects have not used SIMD, but that is changing.
As we work on CPU/GPU hybrid rendering techniques, it's clear that we need SIMD to get maximal performance of the CPU side.
We also see opportunities in faster color conversion and accelerated 2D geometry primitives.</p>
<p>This blog post is also a companion to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0WcCUKxk50">podcast</a> I recorded recently with Andr√© Popovitch.
That podcast is a good introduction to SIMD concepts, while this blog post focuses more on future directions.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-example">A simple example</h2>
<p>As a running example, we'll compute a <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/audio/2018/09/05/sigmoid.html">sigmoid</a> function for a vector of 4 values.
The scalar version is as follows:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn </span><span>sigmoid</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>: [</span><span>f32</span><span>; 4]) -&gt; [</span><span>f32</span><span>; </span><span>4</span><span>] {
</span><span>    x.</span><span>map</span><span>(|</span><span>y</span><span>| y / (</span><span>1.0 </span><span>+ y * y).</span><span>sqrt</span><span>())
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This particular simple code autovectorizes nicely (<a href="https://rust.godbolt.org/z/TfThE5r33">Godbolt link</a>), but more complex examples often fail to autovectorize, often because of subtle differences in floating point semantics.
(Editorial note: a previous version of this post didn't autovectorize (<a href="https://rust.godbolt.org/z/GoTEK3KT3">Godbolt</a>) because optimization level was set at <code>-O</code>, which is less aggressive than <code>-C opt-level=3</code>, the latter of which is the default for release builds)</p>
<h2 id="safety">Safety</h2>
<p>One of the biggest problems with writing SIMD in Rust is that all exposed SIMD intrinsics are marked as <code>unsafe</code>, even in cases where they can be used safely.
The reason is that support for SIMD features varies widely, and executing a SIMD instruction on a CPU that does not support it is undefined behavior ‚Äì the chip can crash, ignore the instruction, or do something unexpected.
To be used safely, there must be some other mechanism to establish that the CPU does support the feature.</p>
<p>Here's the running example in hand-written intrinsic code, showing the need to write <code>unsafe</code> to access SIMD intrinsics at all:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[</span><span>cfg</span><span>(target_arch = "</span><span>aarch64</span><span>")]
</span><span>fn </span><span>sigmoid_neon</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>: [</span><span>f32</span><span>; 4]) -&gt; [</span><span>f32</span><span>; </span><span>4</span><span>] {
</span><span>    </span><span>use </span><span>core::arch::aarch64::*;
</span><span>    </span><span>unsafe </span><span>{
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> x_simd = core::mem::transmute(x);
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> x_squared = </span><span>vmulq_f32</span><span>(x_simd, x_simd);
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> ones = </span><span>vdupq_n_f32</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>);
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> sum = </span><span>vaddq_f32</span><span>(ones, x_squared);
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> sqrt = </span><span>vsqrtq_f32</span><span>(sum);
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> ratio = </span><span>vdivq_f32</span><span>(x_simd, sqrt);
</span><span>        core::mem::transmute(ratio)
</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>#[</span><span>cfg</span><span>(target_arch = "</span><span>x86_64</span><span>")]
</span><span>fn </span><span>sigmoid_sse2</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>: [</span><span>f32</span><span>; 4]) -&gt; [</span><span>f32</span><span>; </span><span>4</span><span>] {
</span><span>    </span><span>use </span><span>core::arch::x86_64::*;
</span><span>    </span><span>unsafe </span><span>{
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> x_simd = core::mem::transmute(x);
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> x_squared = </span><span>_mm_mul_ps</span><span>(x_simd, x_simd);
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> ones = </span><span>_mm_set1_ps</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>);
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> sum = </span><span>_mm_add_ps</span><span>(ones, x_squared);
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> sqrt = </span><span>_mm_sqrt_ps</span><span>(sum);
</span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> ratio = </span><span>_mm_div_ps</span><span>(x_simd, sqrt);
</span><span>        core::mem::transmute(ratio)
</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This is quite a simplified example.
For one, the SIMD width is fixed at 4 lanes (128 bits).
Most likely, in practice you'd iterate over a larger slice, taking chunks equal to the natural SIMD width.</p>
<h2 id="multiversioning">Multiversioning</h2>
<p>A central problem important for SIMD is multiversioning and runtime dispatch.
In some cases, you know the exact CPU target, for example when compiling a binary you'll run only on your machine (in which case <code>target-cpu=native</code> is appropriate).
But when distributing software more widely, there may be a range of capabilities.
For highest performance, it's necessary to compile multiple versions of the code, and do runtime detection to dispatch to the best SIMD code the hardware can run.
This problem was expressed in the original fearless SIMD blog post, and there hasn't been significant advance at the Rust language level since then.</p>
<p>In the C++ world, the <a href="https://github.com/google/highway">Highway</a> library provides excellent SIMD support for a very wide range of targets, and also solves the multiversioning problem.
Among other uses are the codecs for the JPEG-XL image format.
Such codecs are an ideal use case for SIMD programming in general, and shipping them in a browser requires a good solution to multiversioning.
Highway has a really good explanation of <a href="https://github.com/kfjahnke/zimt/blob/multi_isa/examples/multi_isa_example/multi_simd_isa.md">their approach to multiversioning</a>.
It will be useful to study it carefully to see how they've solved various problems.
And a concise way of saying what I'd like to see is "Highway for Rust."</p>
<p>One possible approach is a crate called <a href="https://docs.rs/multiversion/latest/multiversion/">multiversion</a>, which uses macros to replicate the code for multiple versions.
A more recent macro-based approach is <a href="https://github.com/a4lg/rust-target-feature-dispatch">rust-target-feature-dispatch</a>.
It is generally a similar approach to multiversion, and the specific differences are set out in that crate's <a href="https://github.com/a4lg/rust-target-feature-dispatch/blob/main/src/README.md">README</a>.</p>
<p>Another approach, as I believe first advocated in my 2018 blog post, is to write functions polymorphic on a zero-sized type representing the SIMD capabilities, then rely on monomorphization to create the various versions.
One motivation for this approach is to encode safety in Rust's type system.
Having the zero-sized token is proof of the underlying CPU having a certain level of SIMD capability, so calling those intrinsics is safe.
A major library that uses this approach is <a href="https://docs.rs/pulp/latest/pulp/">pulp</a>, which also powers the <a href="https://docs.rs/faer/latest/faer/">faer</a> linear algebra library.</p>
<p>I started putting together a pulp version of the running example, but ran into the immediate problem that it lacks a <code>sqrt</code> intrinsic (this would be easy enough to add, however).
It also works a bit differently, in that it only supports vectors of the natural width, not ones of a fixed width.
For general linear algebra, that's fine, but for some other applications it adds friction, for example colors with alpha are naturally chunks of 4 scalars.
To see an example of pulp code, as well as some discussion, see this <a href="https://xi.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/255911-rust/topic/Rust.20SIMD.20thoughts/near/489370476">Zulip thread</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/raphlinus/fearless_simd/pull/2">fearless_simd#2</a> I propose a prototype of reasonably-ergonomic SIMD multiversioning.
Like the original fearless_simd prototype, vector data types are polymorphic on SIMD level.
The new prototype goes beyond that in several important ways.
For one, arithmetic traits in std::ops are implemented for vector types, so it's possible to add two vectors together, multiply vectors by scalars, etc.</p>
<p>Here's what the running example looks like in that prototype:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[</span><span>inline</span><span>(always)]
</span><span>fn </span><span>sigmoid_impl</span><span>&lt;S: Simd&gt;(</span><span>simd</span><span>: S, </span><span>x</span><span>: [</span><span>f32</span><span>; 4]) -&gt; [</span><span>f32</span><span>; </span><span>4</span><span>] {
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> x_simd: f32x4&lt;S&gt; = x.</span><span>simd_into</span><span>(simd);
</span><span>    (x_simd / (</span><span>1.0 </span><span>+ x_simd * x_simd).</span><span>sqrt</span><span>()).</span><span>into</span><span>()
</span><span>}

<p>An advantage of the fearless_simd#2 prototype over pulp is a feature for downcasting based on SIMD level, so it's possible to write different code optimized for different chips.
See the <a href="https://github.com/raphlinus/fearless_simd/pull/2/files#diff-be8aece917a9235076ff8ec42749b1f1a803d2a3cbc2ccdd5425b405c74f7436">srgb example</a> in that pull request for more detail.
Though there are clear advantages, at this point I'm not sure whether this is the direction to go.
It would be a lot of work to build out all the needed types and operations, with potentially a large amount of repetitive boilerplate code in the library, which in turn may cause issues with compile time.
Another possible direction is a smarter, compiler-like proc macro which synthesizes the SIMD intrinsics as needed based on the types and operations in the source program.</p>
<p>One additional consideration for Rust is that the implementation of runtime feature detection is <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/better-codegen-for-cpu-feature-detection/22083">slower than it should be</a>.
Thus, feature detection and dispatch shouldn't be done at every function call.
A good working solution is to do feature detection once, at the start of the program, then pass that token down through function calls.
It's workable but definitely an ergonomic paper cut.</p>
<h2 id="fp16-and-avx-512">FP16 and AVX-512</h2>
<p>A general trend in parallel computation, really fueled by AI workloads, is smaller scalars with higher throughputs.
While not yet common on x86_64, the FP16 extension is supported on all Apple Silicon desktop CPUs and most recent high-ish end ARM-based phones.
Since Neon is only 128 bits wide, having 8 lanes is welcome.
I find the f16 format to be especially useful for pixel values, as it can encode color values with more than enough precision to avoid visual artifacts (8 bits is not quite enough, though it is good enough for some applications, as long as you're not trying to do HDR).</p>
<p>Native Rust support for the <code>f16</code> type has not yet landed (tracked in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/125440">rust#125440</a>), which makes use of this scalar size harder.
However, there is some support in the <a href="https://docs.rs/half/latest/half/">half</a> library, and also the <a href="https://github.com/raphlinus/fearless_simd/pull/2">fearless_simd#2</a> prototype exports a number of FP16 Neon instructions through inline assembly.
When true f16 support lands, it will be possible to switch over to intrinsics, which will have better optimization and ergonomics (for example, the same method will splat constants converted to <code>f16</code> at compile time and <code>f32</code> variables to be converted at runtime).</p>
<p>AVX-512 is a somewhat controversial SIMD capability.
It first appeared in the ill-fated Larrabee project, which shipped in limited numbers as the Xeon Phi starting in 2010, and has since appeared in scattered Intel CPUs, but with compromises.
In particular, sprinkling even a small amount of AVX-512 code into a program could result in downclocking, reducing performance for all workloads (see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56852812/simd-instructions-lowering-cpu-frequency#comment100256395_56852812">Stack Overflow thread on throttling</a> for more details).
These days, the most likely way to get a CPU with AVX-512 is an AMD Zen 4 or Zen 5; it is on their strength that AVX-512 makes up about 16% of computers in the Steam hardware survey.</p>
<p>The increased width is not the main reason to be enthusiastic about AVX-512.
Indeed, on Zen 4 and most Zen 5 chips, the datapath is 256 bits so full 512 bit instructions are "double pumped." The most exciting aspect is predication based on masks, a common implementation technique on GPUs.
In particular, memory load and store operations are safe when the mask bit is zero, which is especially helpful for using SIMD efficiently on strings.
Without predication, a common technique is to write two loops, the first handling only even multiples of the SIMD width, and a second, usually written as scalars, to handle the odd-size "tail".
There are lots of problems with this - code bloat, worse branch prediction, inability to exploit SIMD for chunks slightly less than the natural SIMD width (which gets worse as SIMD grows wider), and risks that the two loops don't have exactly the same behavior.</p>
<p>Going forward, Intel has proposed AVX10, and will hopefully ship AVX 10.2 chips in the next few years.
This extension has pretty much all of the features of AVX-512, with some cleanups and new features (until recently, AVX10 was defined has having a 256 bit base width and optionally 512, but 512 is now the baseline).
In addition, AVX10.2 will include 16-bit floats (currently available only in the Sapphire Rapids high-end server and workstation chips).</p>
<h2 id="about-std-simd">About std::simd</h2>
<p>The "portable SIMD" work has been going on for many years and currently has a home as the nightly <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/simd/index.html">std::simd</a>.
While I think it will be very useful in many applications, I am not personally very excited about it for my applications.
For one, because it emphasizes portability, it encourages a "lowest common denominator" approach, while I believe that for certain use cases it will be important to tune algorithms to best use the specific quirks of the different SIMD implementations.
For two, std::simd does not itself solve the multiversion problem.
From my perspective, it's probably best to consider it as a souped-up version of autovectorization.</p>
<h2 id="language-evolution">Language evolution</h2>
<p>Rust's out of the box support for SIMD is still quite rough, especially the need to use <code>unsafe</code> extensively.
While some of the gap can be filled with libraries, arguably it should be a goal of the language itself to support safe SIMD code.
There is progress in this direction.</p>
<p>First, the original version of <code>target_feature</code> requires <code>unsafe</code> to call into <em>any</em> function annotated with <code>#[target_feature]</code>.
A proposal to relax that so that functions already under a target_feature gate can call safely call into another function with the same gate is called "<a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2396-target-feature-1.1.html">target_feature 1.1</a>" and is scheduled to ship in 1.86.
Closely related, once inside the suitable target_feature gate, the majority of SIMD intrinsics (broadly, those that don't do memory access through pointers) should be considered safe by the compiler, and that feature (safe intrinsics in core::arch) is also in flight.</p>
<p>There's more that can be done to help the Rust compiler recognize when SIMD use is safe, in particular to allow target_features when a concrete witness to the SIMD level is passed in as a function argument.
The "struct target_features" proposal (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3525">RFC 3525</a>) enables target_feature in such cases, and is one of the proposals considered in the proposed Rust project goal <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2025h1/simd-multiversioning.html">Nightly support for ergonomic SIMD multiversioning</a>.</p>
<p>In general, improving Rust SIMD support will require both libraries and support in the Rust language.
Different approaches at the library level may indicate different language features to best support them.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2>
<p>My main goal in putting these prototypes forward, as well as writing these blog posts, is to spark conversation on how best to support SIMD programming in Rust.
If done well, it is a great opportunity for the language, and fits in with its focus on performance and portability.</p>
<p>As we build out the <a href="https://xi.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/197075-vello/topic/Potato.20-.20a.20paper.20design.20for.20a.20CPU.2FGPU.20hybrid.20renderer">Vello hybrid CPU/GPU renderer</a>, performance of the CPU components will rely heavily on SIMD, so we need to invest in writing a lot of SIMD code.
The most conservative approach would be hand-writing unsafe intrinsics-based code for all targets, but that's a lot of work and the use of unsafe is unappealing.
I'd love for the Rust ecosystem can come together and build good infrastructure, competitive with Highway.
For now, I think it's time to carefully consider the design space and try to come to consensus on what that should look like.</p>

<div>
<p>TLDR</p>
<p>You can add uv into the shebang line for a Python script to make it a self-contained executable.</p>
</div>
<p>I am working on a Go project to better learn the language. It's a simple API backed by a postgres database.</p>
<p>When I need to test out an endpoint, I prefer to use the <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org/">httpx</a> python package inside an
<a href="https://ipython.org/">ipython</a> REPL over making curl requests. It's nice to be able to introspect responses and easily
package payloads with dicts instead of writing out JSON.</p>
<p>Anyway, I decided to write a script to upsert some user data so that I can beat on my <code>/users</code> endpoint.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>My <code>jam_users.py</code> script looks like this:</p>

</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is really straight-forward. It will clear out any existing users and then insert these test users. Right after
that, I get dropped into an <code>ipython</code> repl to do what I need for testing. All I have to do is run:</p>

<p>However, if I want to run the script as-is, I will need to choose one of these approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the dependencies <code>httpx</code>, <code>IPython</code>, and <code>loguru</code> globally in my system python</li>
<li>Create a virtual environment, activate it, install deps, and run my script while the venv is activated</li>
</ul>
<p>These are both not great options in my opinion. These approaches also rely on having a system python installed that is
compatible with these packages. This isn't as big of a problem, but something to consider anyway.</p>
<p>I've been using <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a> a lot lately, and I'm becoming quite enamoured with its usefulness
as a package manager, efficiency as a pip replacement, and abilities for isolated python executables. One thing that I
haven't used much yet are the special <code># /// script</code> tags in a python script.</p>
<p>When I first read about this functionality, I was pretty skeptical. I'm not particularly keen on embedding syntax into
comments. However, this seemed like the perfect application. So, updated my script to include the deps in the script
header like so:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-2-1"><a id="__codelineno-2-1" name="__codelineno-2-1" href="#__codelineno-2-1"></a><span># /// script</span>
</span><span id="__span-2-2"><a id="__codelineno-2-2" name="__codelineno-2-2" href="#__codelineno-2-2"></a><span># dependencies = ["ipython", "httpx", "loguru"]</span>
</span><span id="__span-2-3"><a id="__codelineno-2-3" name="__codelineno-2-3" href="#__codelineno-2-3"></a><span># ///</span>
</span><span id="__span-2-4"><a id="__codelineno-2-4" name="__codelineno-2-4" href="#__codelineno-2-4"></a><span>import</span><span> </span><span>httpx</span>
</span><span id="__span-2-5"><a id="__codelineno-2-5" name="__codelineno-2-5" href="#__codelineno-2-5"></a><span>import</span><span> </span><span>IPython</span>
</span><span id="__span-2-6"><a id="__codelineno-2-6" name="__codelineno-2-6" href="#__codelineno-2-6"></a><span>from</span><span> </span><span>loguru</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>logger</span>
</span><span id="__span-2-7"><a id="__codelineno-2-7" name="__codelineno-2-7" href="#__codelineno-2-7"></a>
</span><span id="__span-2-8"><a id="__codelineno-2-8" name="__codelineno-2-8" href="#__codelineno-2-8"></a><span>...</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With this added, now I can run the script really easily with <code>uv</code>:</p>

<p>Great! Now, <code>uv</code> will create an isolated virtual environment for the script, download the dependencies and install them,
and then run my script in the context of that venv! I don't have to manage the virtual environment myself nor worry
about cluttering my system python with packages that I will invariably forget to remove later.</p>
<p>One nice thing about a regular Python script, though, is that you can make it executable with a shebang line:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-4-1"><a id="__codelineno-4-1" name="__codelineno-4-1" href="#__codelineno-4-1"></a><span>#!/usr/bin/env python</span>
</span><span id="__span-4-2"><a id="__codelineno-4-2" name="__codelineno-4-2" href="#__codelineno-4-2"></a><span>...</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, if I make the script executable (<code>chmod +x jam_users.py</code>), I can invoke it directly as an executable script!
However, this won't take advantage of the <code>uv</code> script header because Python itself will just ignore the comment.</p>
<p>So, I did some digging and found out that you can actually embed the invocation of the uv command right in the shebang
line like so:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span id="__span-5-1"><a id="__codelineno-5-1" name="__codelineno-5-1" href="#__codelineno-5-1"></a><span>#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script</span>
</span><span id="__span-5-2"><a id="__codelineno-5-2" name="__codelineno-5-2" href="#__codelineno-5-2"></a><span># /// script</span>
</span><span id="__span-5-3"><a id="__codelineno-5-3" name="__codelineno-5-3" href="#__codelineno-5-3"></a><span># dependencies = ["ipython", "httpx", "loguru"]</span>
</span><span id="__span-5-4"><a id="__codelineno-5-4" name="__codelineno-5-4" href="#__codelineno-5-4"></a><span># ///</span>
</span><span id="__span-5-5"><a id="__codelineno-5-5" name="__codelineno-5-5" href="#__codelineno-5-5"></a><span>import</span><span> </span><span>httpx</span>
</span><span id="__span-5-6"><a id="__codelineno-5-6" name="__codelineno-5-6" href="#__codelineno-5-6"></a><span>import</span><span> </span><span>IPython</span>
</span><span id="__span-5-7"><a id="__codelineno-5-7" name="__codelineno-5-7" href="#__codelineno-5-7"></a><span>from</span><span> </span><span>loguru</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>logger</span>
</span><span id="__span-5-8"><a id="__codelineno-5-8" name="__codelineno-5-8" href="#__codelineno-5-8"></a>
</span><span id="__span-5-9"><a id="__codelineno-5-9" name="__codelineno-5-9" href="#__codelineno-5-9"></a><span>...</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This works because the <code>-S</code> flag tells the system to split everything after it into separate arguments before passing it
to the system's <code>env</code>.</p>
<p>Now (after <code>chmod +x jam_users.py</code>, of course), I can execute my script directly:</p>

<p>That's it! What's even better is that I can run this script on any (Unix) system that has <code>uv</code> installed without needing
to do ANY dependency or virtual environment management.</p>
<p>Now, this script itself is really trivial and not much more than a toy example. However, in my past I have written
rather complex scripts that I needed to hand off to other users to run. Of course, this always came with a long
explanation of how to <em>prepare</em> their system just to run the script. This approach solves that problem instantly and
painlessly (as long as they have <code>uv</code> installed).</p>
<p>Take it for a spin, and let me know your thoughts.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

        <h2>Convert Linux to Windows</h2>
        <span>2025-03-29</span>
		<p>
		Thesis: We should create a distro of Linux that runs Windows binaries by default via Wine.
		</p>
		<h3>The Linux Environment is Unstable</h3>
		<p>
		I can pull down a 20 year old exe and still run it today on Windows.
		Try doing the same with a Linux binary that's just a year old.
		There's no guarantee that it will be able to run based off some update that has happened. 
		There's also no guarantee that a binary produced today on Linux will even work on the various distributions of Linux today due to the same installed library version problem. 
		</p>
		<p>
		While the Linux syscalls themselves are very stable and reliable, the c library on top of them <a href="https://jangafx.com/insights/Linux-binary-compatibility">is not</a>.
		Practically all of userland is based on libc, and therefore by proxy Linux itself has a binary compatibility problem.
		</p>

		<h3>Binary Distribution is a Problem</h3>
		<p>
		Because of the problems listed above (and more), there is no good way to distribute binaries for Linux. 
		There are four (yes four!) major ways to distribute binaries, and they all have problems:
		</p><ol>
			<li>The raw binary. If this worked, we wouldn't need the other solutions.</li>
			<li>AppImage. Completely self-contained artifact that bundles all dependencies in with the binary.</li>
			<li>Flatpak. A package manager that provides a sandbox for each application.</li>
			<li>Snaps. Yet another package manager that runs applications in a sandbox.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>
		There are even more ways of distributing binaries, but these are the major ones. 
		What's crazy is that all four methods can be used at once on a system, each with their own methods of installing, updating, and deleting applications.
		I won't go into the pros and cons of each method here, but there are arguments about each.
		</p>
		<p>
		A major downside for all these methods is that application preservation is essentially non-existant for all of them. 
		Can a person archive an application for 20 years, pull it from the dustbin, and execute it with no other effort?
		Maybe for AppImage? Who knows? 
		It's a definite "no" for the other three methods.
		</p>

		<h3>Win32 is the Answer</h3>
		<p>
		A few years ago, Arek Hiler wrote a blog post, <a href="https://blog.hiler.eu/win32-the-only-stable-abi/">Win32 Is The Only Stable ABI On Linux</a>.
		He is absolutely right, and I believe this insight holds the answer to Linux's compatibility problem. 
		This is actually made possible by a genius decision for the design of Win32.
		</p>
		<p>
		In Linux, you can make system calls directly. 
		Just fill up some registers and make a syscall interrupt.
		</p>
		<p>
		In Windows, you do not make system calls directly. 
		Instead, you dynamically link to libraries that make the system calls for you. 
		This allows Microsoft to do all sorts of shenanigans at the kernal level while providing a stable API to userspace.
		This little stroke of genius allows us to have both Linux and Windows on the same machine at the same time. 
		</p>
		<p>
		If you think about it, there are only two major differences between a Windows app and a Linux app. 
		One, they use different executable formats.
		Two, Windows uses dynamic libraries to make system calls.
		Just use a PE format instead of ELF, load a couple libraries, and you essentially have a Windows application!
		We also already have a simple way to run Windows applications, Wine.
		</p>
		<p>
		Wine is a miraculous project.
		It provides amazing compatibility with Windows applications going all the way back to the 32-bit Windows 95 era. 
		It even implements DirectX!
		The difference between what Windows supports and Wine supports is approaching zero over time (especially if you stick to Win32).
		Wine is the magic we can use to fix our problem.
		</p>

		<h3>A New Distro</h3>
		<p>
		Imagine we made a new Linux distro. 
		This distro would provide a desktop environment that looks close enough to Windows that a Windows user could use it without training. 
		You could install and run Windows applications exactly as you do on Windows; no extra work needed.
		How would this work?
		</p>
		<p>
		The distro would come with Wine pre-installed, and there would be some small patches to the Linux kernel.
		A small modification to the "exec" family of system calls to dispatch on executble type would allow any Linux application to fork an exec a Windows application with no effort. 
		</p>
		<p>
		A wine prefix could be setup for each user, and the desktop environment would work off of that prefix, presenting a Windows-like file system to the user, and to user applications. 
		Linux as we know it would still be available, but hidden for the normal GUI desktop user. 
		</p>

		<h3>True Multiplatform</h3>
		Wine works on Linux, FreeBSD, ReactOS, macOS, Android, and Haiku. 
		If we published all our applications as Windows/Win32 apps we could achive multiplatform compatibility without any extra effort.

		<h3>The Looming Future</h3>
		<p>
		The two major commercial operating systems, MacOS and Windows, are heading in the same direction. 
		These OSs are becoming more locked down, violating privacy, and removing control user's have over their own computing environment. 
		Both OSs are arguably building in outright spyware into their operating systems. 
		Windows is going to take <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/retrace-your-steps-with-recall-aa03f8a0-a78b-4b3e-b0a1-2eb8ac48701c">screenshots</a> of your screen every few seconds and have an AI analyze it.
		MacOS has a feature called <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445">Gatekeeper</a>, which limits what software you can run on your Mac to only those applications that Apple approves.
		Both Apple and Microsoft are in the process of adding the ability to scan your computer for "illegal" files and report you to the authorities. 
		</p>
		<p>
		These features are done in the name of convenience and "child safety", but the net effect is that billions of users lose their agency and control over their own computers. 
		What happens when you no longer have any control over your computer? 
		What happens when your operating system is a subscription?
		What happens when you do something these companies don't like and you are banned from using any computer?
		</p>
		<p>
		Microsoft is already <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/new-windows-11-build-makes-mandatory-microsoft-account-sign-in-even-more-mandatory/">removing the ability</a> to run Windows without an online account.
		If you lose your account, even for a mistake, you lose the ability to run a computer. 
		</p>
		<p>
		<em><strong>NOTE:</strong> I am not against Apple or Microsoft. They have amazing engineers! I don't think they're being malicious. Rather, I think the incentives for these companies are improperly aligned. Economic and governmental forces are guiding them down this path. They could absolutely change tack and try to empower users, but I think we shouldn't assume that will happen naturally.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
		This is why I think we need a "Windows" distro of Linux.
		Not only does it solve our binary compatibility problem, it also provides an onramp to Windows users who will be forced to "upgrade" to Windows 11 in October of this year.
		Wouldn't it be great to have a painless way to switch Linux?
		</p>

		<p>
		Just a thought.

Under their new package visibility policy, apps </span><em>should</em><span> only see other installed apps if it‚Äôs essential to their core functionality. Developers must also explicitly declare these apps in the AndroidManifest.xml file - a required configuration file for all Android apps.</span></p><p><span>For extremely specific use cases such as file managers, browsers or antivirus apps, Google grants an exception by allowing </span><code>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</code><span> permission, which provides full visibility into installed apps. </span></p><p>I don‚Äôt use Android as my primary phone, but I have a spare one and I was really curious to find out which apps from Indian companies had checks to see what other apps I had installed.</p><p>So I downloaded a few dozen Indian apps I could think of on top of my head and started reading their manifest files. Surely they will be respectful of my privacy and will only query apps essential to their app's core functionality? üôÉ</p><p>It's worth acknowledging that there are some legitimate reasons for an app to check which other apps are installed on your phone. For example, an app might check which UPI apps are installed to show relevant payment options. Most of the manifest files I examined included checks for these apps. Some also looked for app cloning or multi-account apps, likely for security and fraud detection. All acceptable use cases.</p><p>But a few Indian companies went above and beyond with these checks.

I hope someone reading this can do a thorough analysis. It's probably because of the bubble I live in, but I hadn‚Äôt even heard of most of these apps. Even though most of them have tens of millions of downloads.</span></p><p><span>Beyond the usual categories, I see there are checks for apps like Tamil Calendar, Odia Calendar, Qibla Direction Finder, mandir apps, astrology apps. They know what they‚Äôre doing.</span></p></div><p>There is "Jodii for Diploma, +2,10 below", a matrimony app for those who haven‚Äôt graduated high school.

But these apps are bypassing this restriction by individually listing every app they want to detect in their manifest file instead.</span></p><p><span>I found only one manifest file which had the high-risk and sensitive </span><code>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</code><span> permission - it was Cred‚Äôs. Play Store grants a "temporary exception" to include this permission if apps have ‚Äúa verifiable core purpose facilitating financial-transactions involving financially regulated instruments‚Äù.  </span></p><p>But none of the other apps in the same segment as Cred I analyzed like PhonePe or PayTM had this permission in their manifest files. In fact, Cred offers personal loans too which as per Play Store‚Äôs Personal loans policy, is not eligible for this exception. Not sure how Cred is still allowed to keep this permission, which lets it see all the apps on your phone without any disclosures.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png" width="634" height="358" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:358,&quot;width&quot;:634,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:75001,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://peabee.substack.com/i/159986160?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4cfbfc7d-5585-454d-8f07-d428f03b15b9_634x358.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>I read the manifest files of around 50 popular apps from Indian companies. Apart from Swiggy, Zepto, Cred, and a couple of personal loan apps, most had fairly reasonable and respectful app query lists. </p><p>Guess I expected worse. Maybe I am too cynical about these apps - could they actually be the good guys? üôÉ</p><p>As I was about to conclude this exercise, I noticed a couple of interesting lines when I was skimming through the manifest file of one of the apps:</p><pre><code>&lt;queries&gt;
  [...]
  &lt;intent&gt;
    &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" /&gt;
  &lt;/intent&gt;
  [...]
&lt;/queries&gt;</code></pre><p>I am no expert in Android development, but from what I understand, the "ACTION_MAIN" filter in the configuration above allows visibility to all installed apps that, simply put, have a screen.</p><p><span>Since most installed apps run in the foreground and have a user interface, this filter grants developers access to see all the apps on your phone - without needing the </span><code>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</code><span> permission!</span></p><p>To be sure, I vibe co -- I can't say it without wincing -- I vibe coded a basic android app and added the same "ACTION_MAIN" filter in my manifest file. And when I queried for installed packages, just as expected, this little hack returned a list of all the apps on my phone!!!</p><p>This seems like a massive privacy loophole in Android. Surely Play Store would reject apps that use this hack as this is a blatant violation of their store's user data policy? </p><p>Out of 47 Indian apps I randomly analyzed, 31 of them used the "ACTION_MAIN" filter - giving them access to see all the apps on your phone without any disclosure. That's 2 out of 3 apps.</p><p>Apps using this hack: </p><blockquote><p><em>Astrotalk, Axis Mobile, Bajaj Finserv, BookMyShow, Cars24, Cure.fit, Fibe, Groww, Housing, Instamart, Ixigo, JioHotstar, KreditBee, KukuTV, LazyPay, Ludo King, Meesho, MoneyTap, Moneyview, Navi, NoBroker, Nykaa, Ola, PhonePe, PhysicsWallah, Slice, Spinny, Swiggy, Swiggy Delivery, Tata Neu, and Zomato.</em></p></blockquote><p>Apps that don't use this hack: </p><blockquote><p><em>Airtel Thanks, Blinkit, Byju‚Äôs, MyGate, Dream11, Flipkart, HDFC Mobile, Healthify, INDmoney, MyJio, Paytm, PaisaBazaar, ShareChat, Unacademy, Vedantu, Zepto</em></p></blockquote><p>Even fucking Ludo King has this in its manifest file. So most Indian companies can actually see all the apps on your phone - they're just sneakier about it than the likes of Swiggy and Zepto. So much for being the good guys.</p><div><p><span>In fact, Swiggy has got this filter config too, yet it still chooses to explicitly lists the apps it queries when it could just as easily do this discreetly behind closed doors like others. But I‚Äôm not complaining. This oversight from them gives a glimpse into Swiggy‚Äôs data collection practices. If Google had enforced this policy properly, we might have had similar visibility into other companies as well.</span></p><p><span>All the manifest files I read are in </span><a href="https://github.com/pea1bee/android-manifest-files" rel="">my Github</a><span>. The majority were downloaded on March 18 or 19.</span></p></div><p><span>This hack isn‚Äôt exclusively used by apps from Indian companies. I checked the manifest files of some other popular apps. </span><em>Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Subway Surfers, and Truecaller</em><span> all have this config. Meanwhile, </span><em>Amazon, Spotify, X, Discord, and WhatsApp</em><span> didn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt investigate further beyond these.</span></p><p>This makes me wonder, what was the whole purpose of Google's package visibility policy? It was supposed to protect users, yet most apps seem to have found ways around it anyway.</p><p><span>And installed app data is very sensitive and personal. In 2022, </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/data-marketplace-selling-clue-period-tracking-data/" rel="">Vice reported</a><span> that a data marketplace called Narrative was selling data on users who had downloaded period-tracking apps right after news emerged that Roe v. Wade (which had federally protected abortion rights in the U.S.) could be overturned. This is frightening to even think about. </span></p><p>Installed apps data is one data point. The extensive set of permissions each and every one of these apps have included in their manifest files, often far beyond what‚Äôs necessary is another can of worm for someone else to open. </p><p><span>I‚Äôll conclude this post with a tiny example from Zepto. They ask for </span><code>READ_SMS</code><span> permission. You can deny it, but it‚Äôs mandatory if you sign up for Zepto Postpaid. </span></p><p>When you grant the permission, this is the list of sender IDs they check for in your inbox:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png" width="588" height="184" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:184,&quot;width&quot;:588,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:52980,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://peabee.substack.com/i/159986160?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd062bfa0-bcea-41e9-b754-24f85d5c4ca5_588x184.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Most of them are TRAI sender IDs of banks.

            Apple has been getting hammered in tech and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/apple-ai-siri-development-behind-9ea65ee8" target="_blank">financial media</a> for its uncharacteristically messy foray into artificial intelligence. After <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/business/apple-iphone-ai-nightcap/index.html">a June event</a> heralding a new AI-powered Siri, the company has delayed its release indefinitely. The AI features Apple has rolled out, including text message summaries, are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24289939/apple-intelligence-ai-notification-summaries-awkward-funny-bad" target="_blank">comically unhelpful.</a>

            Apple, like every other big player in tech, is scrambling to find ways to inject AI into its products. Why? <em>Well, it‚Äôs the</em> <em>future!</em> What problems is it solving? <em>Well, so far that‚Äôs not clear! </em>Are customers demanding it? <em>LOL, no. </em>In fact, last year the backlash against one of Apple‚Äôs early ads for its AI <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/10/business/ai-dystopia-silicon-valley-nightcap/index.html">was so hostile</a> the company had to pull the commercial.

            Back in June, Apple floated a compelling scenario for its newfangled Siri. Imagine yourself, frazzled and running late for work, simply saying into your phone: Hey Siri, what time does my mom‚Äôs flight land? And is it at JFK or LaGuardia? In theory, Siri could scan your email and texts with your mom and give you an answer. That saves you several annoying steps of opening your email to find the flight number, copying it, then pasting it into Google to find the flight‚Äôs status.

            If it‚Äôs 100% accurate, it‚Äôs a fantastic time saver. If it is anything less than 100% accurate, it‚Äôs useless. Because even if there‚Äôs a 2% chance it‚Äôs wrong, there‚Äôs a 2% chance you‚Äôre stranding mom at the airport, and mom will be, rightly, very disappointed. Our moms deserve better!

Subject: CVE-2025-31160 Atop 2.11 heap problems

Introduction:
Atop mainly reads the system level and process level from the /proc and
/sys directories. However, certain counters might be obtained from other
optional sources, that have to be activated explicitly.

One of these sources is the 'atopgpud' daemon, which permanently gathers
metrics about the utilization of GPUs. It offers a local TCP port to which
atop can connect to retrieve GPU-related counters. These counters are
provided as strings that have to be parsed by atop.


Vulnerability:
The vulnerability is caused by the fact that atop always tries to connect
to the TCP port of 'atopgpud' during initialization. When another local
program has been started (instead of 'atopgpud') that listens to this TCP
port, atop connects to that program. Such program is able then to send
unexpected strings that may lead to parsing failures in atop. These failures
result in heap problems and segmentation faults.

Although no additional information has been received about these heap
problems, the described heap problems were reproduced with a custom
developed test program.

The vulnerability is present since the introduction of 'atopgpud'
in atop 2.4.0.


Solution:
1) Most systems will not explicitly activate the 'atopgpud' daemon.
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the default behavior of atop is now not to connect to the TCP
 &nbsp;&nbsp; port at all. Only when atop is started with the '-k' flag it will try to
 &nbsp;&nbsp; connect to the TCP port (in case you know that 'atopgpud' is running).

2) When the '-k' flag is used, the parsing of the strings is improved to
 &nbsp;&nbsp; avoid that heap problems can occur.

3) Another optional source for atop might be 'netatop' or 'netatop-bpf'.
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Since most systems will not explicitly install/use these sources, 
the default
 &nbsp;&nbsp; behavior of atop is now not to try to find these sources. Only when 
atop is
 &nbsp;&nbsp; started with the '-K' flag it will try to find 'netatop' or 
'netatop-bpf'.

<p>Some film¬≠mak¬≠ers start in com¬≠mer¬≠cials, hon¬≠ing their chops in antic¬≠i¬≠pa¬≠tion of mak¬≠ing per¬≠son¬≠al projects lat¬≠er. A select few go in the oth¬≠er direc¬≠tion, real¬≠iz¬≠ing their dis¬≠tinc¬≠tive vision before field¬≠ing offers from com¬≠pa¬≠nies who want a piece of that vision‚Äôs cul¬≠tur¬≠al cur¬≠ren¬≠cy. Any¬≠one who‚Äôs seen David Lynch‚Äôs most acclaimed work&nbsp;will sus¬≠pect, cor¬≠rect¬≠ly, that Lynch belongs in the lat¬≠ter group. With 1977‚Äôs cult hit&nbsp;<em>Eraser¬≠head</em>, he showed cin¬≠e¬≠ma what it means to be <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2017/11/what-makes-a-david-lynch-film-lynchian-a-video-essay.html">Lynchi¬≠an</a>. This brought him the atten¬≠tion of Hol¬≠ly¬≠wood, lead¬≠ing to the respectable suc¬≠cess of&nbsp;<em>The Ele¬≠phant Man&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;the dis¬≠as¬≠ter that was&nbsp;<em>Dune</em>. Only in 1986, with&nbsp;<em>Blue Vel¬≠vet</em>, could Lynch make a tru¬≠ly, even trou¬≠bling¬≠ly per¬≠son¬≠al film that hit the zeit¬≠geist at just the right moment.</p>
<p>Nat¬≠u¬≠ral¬≠ly, Madi¬≠son Avenue came call¬≠ing soon there¬≠after. ‚ÄúWith the smash <em>Blue Vel¬≠vet</em>, a Palme d‚Äôor at Cannes for <em>Wild at Heart</em>, and then the nation¬≠al phe¬≠nom¬≠e¬≠non of <em>Twin Peaks</em>‚Äô first sea¬≠son, David Lynch clear¬≠ly estab¬≠lished him¬≠self as the U.S.A.‚Äòs fore¬≠most com¬≠mer¬≠cial¬≠ly viable avant-garde-‚Äòoffbeat‚Äô direc¬≠tor,‚Äù wrote David Fos¬≠ter Wal¬≠lace in <a href="http://www.lynchnet.com/lh/lhpremiere.html">a 1997 piece on the film¬≠mak¬≠er</a>.</p>


<p>‚ÄúFor a while there it looked like he might be able to sin¬≠gle-hand¬≠ed¬≠ly bro¬≠ker a new mar¬≠riage between art and com¬≠merce in U.S. movies, open¬≠ing for¬≠mu¬≠la-frozen Hol¬≠ly¬≠wood to some of the eccen¬≠tric¬≠i¬≠ty and vig¬≠or of art film.‚Äù&nbsp;<span>Lynch‚Äôs fans in tele¬≠vi¬≠sion adver¬≠tis¬≠ing must have imag¬≠ined that he could do the same for their indus¬≠try, and you can watch the fruits of that hunch in the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoCYbQBTmlY">half-hour com¬≠pi¬≠la¬≠tion of Lynch-direct¬≠ed com¬≠mer¬≠cials</a><span> above.</span></p>
<p>Lynch has worked for some star¬≠tling¬≠ly big brands, begin¬≠ning with Calvin Klein: his <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2014/01/david-lynchs-literary-perfume-ads.html">trio of spots for the fra¬≠grance&nbsp;Obses¬≠sion</a> take as their basis the writ¬≠ing of F. Scott Fitzger¬≠ald, Ernest Hem¬≠ing¬≠way, and D.H. Lawrence. A few years lat¬≠er he direct¬≠ed a humor¬≠ous <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2015/11/david-lynch-directs-a-mini-season-of-twin-peaks-in-the-form-of-japanese-coffee-commercials.html">mini-sea¬≠son of <em>Twin Peaks</em> to pro¬≠mote Geor¬≠gia Cof¬≠fee</a>, one of the top brands of canned cof¬≠fee in the&nbsp;Lynch-lov¬≠ing coun¬≠try of&nbsp;Japan. The New York Depart¬≠ment of San¬≠i¬≠ta¬≠tion engaged Lynch‚Äôs ser¬≠vices to imbue their anti-lit¬≠ter¬≠ing cam¬≠paign with his sig¬≠na¬≠ture high-con¬≠trast omi¬≠nous¬≠ness, a mood also sought by fash¬≠ion-indus¬≠try titans like Armani, Yves Saint Lau¬≠rent, Guc¬≠ci, and Dior. The mar¬≠keters of hum¬≠bler goods like Alka-Seltzer, Bar¬≠il¬≠la Pas¬≠ta (a seem¬≠ing¬≠ly auteur-aware brand that <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2012/07/wim_wenders_sells_beer_stella_artois_pasta_barilla_and_more_beer_carling.html">has also hired Wim Wen¬≠ders</a> and <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2012/01/fellinis_fantastic_tv_commercials.html">Felli¬≠ni</a>), and Clear Blue Easy home preg¬≠nan¬≠cy tests have also gone in for a touch of the Lynchi¬≠an.</p>
<p>Quite a few of these com¬≠mer¬≠cials orig¬≠i¬≠nal¬≠ly aired only out¬≠side Amer¬≠i¬≠ca, which may reflect the sup¬≠pos¬≠ed¬≠ly more endur¬≠ing appre¬≠ci¬≠a¬≠tion of Lynch‚Äôs work that exists in Europe and Asia. But for all Lynch‚Äôs artis¬≠tic dar¬≠ing, the man him¬≠self has always come off as an enthu¬≠si¬≠ast of unre¬≠con¬≠struct¬≠ed Amer¬≠i¬≠can plea¬≠sures. To this day he remains a stead¬≠fast smok¬≠er, and in 1998 brought that per¬≠son¬≠al cred¬≠i¬≠bil¬≠i¬≠ty to the Swiss cig¬≠a¬≠rette brand Parisi¬≠enne. The result¬≠ing spot fea¬≠tures men in ties, show¬≠ers of sparks, dead fish, back¬≠wards talk¬≠ing, a for¬≠bid¬≠ding¬≠ly illu¬≠mi¬≠nat¬≠ed shack, and apoc¬≠a¬≠lyp¬≠tic flames:&nbsp;Parisi¬≠enne, in oth¬≠er words, must have got exact¬≠ly what they paid for.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  This course, intended for undergraduates familiar with elementary calculus and linear algebra, introduces the extension of differential calculus to functions on more general vector spaces, such as functions that take as input a matrix and return a matrix inverse or factorization, derivatives of ODE solutions, and even stochastic derivatives of random functions. It emphasizes practical computational applications, such as large-scale optimization and machine learning, where derivatives must be re-imagined in order to be propagated through complicated calculations. The class also discusses efficiency concerns leading to "adjoint" or "reverse-mode" differentiation (a.k.a. "backpropagation"), and gives a gentle introduction to modern automatic differentiation (AD) techniques.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>by <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploum">Ploum</a> on 2025-03-28</p><h2 id="soustitre-1">I mean, come on!</h2>
<p>Amazon recently announced that, from now on, everything you say to Alexa will be sent to their server.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/15/altering-the-deal/">Pluralistic: Amazon annihilates Alexa privacy settings, turns on continuous, nonconsensual audio uploading (15 Mar 2025) (pluralistic.net)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>What surprised me the most with this announcement is how it was met with surprise and harsh reactions. People felt betrayed.</p>
<p>I mean, come on!</p>
<p>Did you really think that Amazon was not listening to you before that? Did you really buy an Alexa trusting Amazon to "protect your privacy"?</p>
<p>Recently, I came across a comment on Hacker News where the poster defended Apple as protecting privacy of its users because "They market their product as protecting our privacy".</p>
<p>I mean, once again, come on!</p>
<p>Did you really think that "marketing" is telling the truth? Are you a freshly debarked Thermian? (In case you missed it, this is a Galaxy Quest reference.)</p>
<p>The whole point of marketing is to lie, lie and lie again. </p>
<h2 id="soustitre-2">What is the purpose of that gadget?</h2>
<p>The whole point of the whole Amazon Alexa tech stack is to send information to Amazon. That‚Äôs the main goal of the thing. The fact that it is sometimes useful to you is a direct consequence of the thing sending information to Amazon. Just like Facebook linking you with friends is a consequence of you giving your information to Meta. Usefulness is only a byproduct of privacy invasion.</p>
<p>Having a fine-grained setting enabling "do not send all information to Amazon please" is, at best, wishful thinking. We had the same in the browser ("do-not-track"). It didn‚Äôt work. </p>
<p>I‚Äôve always been convinced that the tech geeks who bought an Amazon Alexa perfectly knew what they were doing. One of my friends has a Google Echo and justify it with "Google already knows everything about our family through our phones, so I‚Äôm trading only a bit more of our privacy for convenience". I don‚Äôt agree with him but, at the very least, it‚Äôs a logical opinion.</p>
<p>We all know that what can be done with a tool will be done eventually. And you should prepare for it. On a side note, I also postulate that the reason Amazon removed that setting is because they were already gathering too much data to justify its existence in case there‚Äôs a complaint or an investigation in the future."How did you manage to get those data while your product says it will not send data?". </p>
<p>But, once again, any tech person knows that pushing a button in an interface is not a proof of anything in the underlying software. </p>
<h2 id="soustitre-3">Please stop being naive about Apple</h2>
<p>That‚Äôs also the point with Apple: Apple is such a big company that the right hand has no idea about what the left hand is doing. Some privacy people are working at Apple and doing good job. But their work is continuously diluted through the interests of quick and cheap production, marketing, release, new features, gathering data for advertising purpose. Apple is not a privacy company and has never been: it is an opportunistic company which advertise privacy when it feels it could help sell more iPhones. But deeply inside, they absolutely don‚Äôt care and they will absolutely trade the (very little) privacy they have if it means selling more.</p>
<p>Sometimes, geek naivety is embarrassingly stupid. Like "brand loyalty". Marketing lies to you. As a rule of thumb, the bigger the company, the bigger the lie. In tech, there‚Äôs no way for a big company to not lie because marketers have no real understanding of they are selling. Do you really think that people who chose to advertise "privacy" at Apple have any strong knowledge about "privacy"? That they could simply give you a definition of "privacy"?</p>
<p>I know that intelligent people go to great intellectual contortions to justify buying the latest overpriced spying shiny coloured screen with an apple logo. It looks like most humans actively look to see their freedom restricted. Seirdy calls it "the domestication of users".</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://seirdy.one/posts/2021/01/27/whatsapp-and-the-domestication-of-users/">WhatsApp and the domestication of users (seirdy.one)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And that‚Äôs why I see Apple as a cult: most tech people cannot be reasoned about it.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="soustitre-4">You can‚Äôt find a technical solution to a lie</h2>
<p>Bill Cole, contributor to Spamassassin, recently posted on Mastodon that the whole DNS stack to protect spammers was not working.</p>
<blockquote> spammers are more consistent at making SPF, DKIM, and DMARC correct than are legitimate senders.<br></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://toad.social/@grumpybozo/114213600922816869">üÜòBill Cole üá∫üá¶: "@jwz@mastodon.social The stats we collect for the‚Ä¶" (toad.social)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is, once again, a naive approach to spam. The whole stack was designed with the mindset "bad spammers will try to hide themselves". But was is happening in your inbox, really?</p>
<p>Most spam is not "black hat spam". It is what I call "white-collar spam": perfectly legitimate company, sending you emails from legitimate address. You slept in a hotel during a business trip? Now you will receive weekly emails about our hotel for the rest of your life. And it is the same for any shop, any outlet, anything you have done. Your inbox is filled with "white-collar" junk. And they know this perfectly well. </p>
<p>In Europe, we have a rule, the RGPD, which forbid businesses to keep your data without your express consent. I did the experiment for several months to send a legal threat to every single white-collar spam I received. Guess what: they always replied that it was a mistake, that I was now removed, that it should not have happened, that I checked the box (which was false but how could I prove it?) or even, on one occasion, that they restored a backup containing my email before I unsubscribed (I unsubscribed from that one 10 years before, which makes it very unlikely).</p>
<p>In short, they lied. All of them. All of them are spammers and they lie pretending that "they thought you were interested".</p>
<p>In one notable case, they told me that they had erased all my data while, still having the cookie on my laptop, I could see and use my account. Thirty days later, I was still connected and I figured that they simply managed to change my user id from "ploum" to "deleted_ploum" in the database. While answering me straight in the face that they had no information about me in their database.</p>
<p>Corporations are lying. You must treat every corporate word as a straight lie until proved otherwise. </p>
<h2 id="soustitre-5">But Ploum, if all marketing is a lie, why trusting Signal?</h2>
<p>If you can‚Äôt trust marketing, why do I‚ÄØuse Signal and Protonmail?</p>
<p>First of all, Signal is open source. And, yes, I‚Äôve read some of the source code for some feature I was interested in. I‚Äôve also read through some very deep audit of Signal source code.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://soatok.blog/2025/02/18/reviewing-the-cryptography-used-by-signal/">Reviewing the Cryptography Used by Signal (soatok.blog)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I‚Äôm also trusting the people behind Signal. I‚Äôm trusting people who recommend Signal. I‚Äôm trusting the way Signal is built. </p>
<p>But most importantly, Signal sole existence is to protect privacy of its users. It‚Äôs not even a corporation and, yes, this is important.</p>
<p>Yes, they could lie in their marketing. Like Telegram did (and still does AFAIK). But this would undermine their sole reason to exist.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt say that Signal is perfect: I say I trust them to believe themselves what they announce. For now.</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-6">What about Protonmail?</h2>
<p>For the same reasons, Protonmail can, to some extent, be trusted. Technically, they can access most of the emails of their customers (because those emails arrive unencrypted to PM‚Äôs servers). But I trust Protonmail not to sell any data because if there‚Äôs any doubt that they do it, the whole business will crumble. They have a strong commercial incentive to do everything they can to protect my data. I pay them for that. It‚Äôs not a "checkbox" they could remove, it‚Äôs their whole raison d‚Äô√™tre.</p>
<p>This is also why I pay for Kagi as my search engine: their business incentive is to provide me the best search results with less slop, less advertising. As soon as they start doing some kind of advertising, I will stop paying them and they know it. Or if Kagi starts becoming to AI centric for my taste, like they did for Lori:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://d-shoot.net/kagi.html">Why I Lost Faith in Kagi (d-shoot.net)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I don‚Äôt blindly trust companies. Paying them is not a commitment to obey them, au contraire. Every relation with a commercial entity is, by essence, temporary. I pay for a service with strings attached. If the service degrade, if my conditions are not respected, I stop paying. If I‚Äôm not convinced they can be trusted, I stop paying them. I know I can pay and still be the product. If I have any doubt, I don‚Äôt pay. I try to find an alternative and migrate to it. Email being critical to me, I always have two accounts on two different trustable providers with an easy migrating path (which boils down to changing my DNS config).</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-7">Fighting the Androidification</h2>
<p>Cory Doctorow speaks a lot about enshitification. Where users are more and more exploited. But one key component of a good enshitification is what I call "Androidification".</p>
<p>Androidification is not about degrading the user experience. It‚Äôs about closing doors, removing special use cases, being less and less transparent. It‚Äôs about taking open source software and frog boiling it to a full closed proprietary state while killing all the competition in the process. </p>
<p>Android was, at first, an Open Source project. With each release, it became more closed, more proprietary. As I explain in my "20 years of Linux on the Desktop" essay, I believe it has always been part of the plan. Besides the Linux kernel, Google was always wary not to include any GPL or LGPL licensed library in Android.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ploum.net/2025-03-08-linux_desktop3.html">20 years of Linux on the Desktop (part 3) (ploum.net)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It took them 15 years but they finally achieved killing the Android Open Source Project:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-android-development-aosp-3538503/">Google will develop the Android OS fully in private, here's why (www.androidauthority.com)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is why I‚Äôm deeply concerned by the motivation of Canonical to switch Ubuntu‚Äôs coreutils to an MIT licensed version.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/03/19/ubuntu_2510_rust/">Ubuntu 25.10 plans to swap GNU coreutils for Rust (go.theregister.com)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is why I‚Äôm deeply concerned that Protonmail quietly removed the issue tracker from its Protonmail Bridge Github page (making the development completely opaque for what is an essential tool for technical Protonmail users).</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-8">I mean, commons!</h2>
<p>This whole naivety is also why I‚Äôm deeply concerned by very intelligent and smart tech people not understanding what "copyleft" is, why it is different from "open source" and why they should care.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ploum.net/2023-06-19-more-rms.html">We need more of Richard Stallman, not less (ploum.net)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Corporations are not your friend. They never were. They lie. The only possible relationship with them is an opportunistic one. And if you want to build commons that they cannot steal, you need strong copyleft.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ploum.net/2024-07-01-opensource_sustainability.html">On Open Source and the Sustainability of the Commons (ploum.net)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But firstly, my fellow geeks, you need to lose your candid naivety.</p>
<p>I mean, come on, let‚Äôs build the commons!</p>

Other states, including Florida and Ohio, are weighing similar legislation.<!-- --></p><p>Fluoride has been added to US drinking water since 1945 to prevent cavities.<!-- --></p><p>Utah's move to remove the mineral has been criticised by experts, who worry it will have consequences for oral health, especially for children.<!-- --></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The bill, signed by Cox on Thursday, prohibits communities from adding fluoride to their public water supplies.<!-- --></p><p>The law does not mention any public health concerns related to the mineral, but Republican state lawmaker Stephanie Gricius - who introduced the bill in the state legislature - has argued that there is research suggesting fluoride could have possible cognitive effects in children.<!-- --></p><p>Gricius has said that her bill would give citizens a choice whether they want to consume fluoride or not.<!-- --></p><p>This concern over fluoride was previously raised by Kennedy, the US health secretary, who said in November that "the Trump White House will advise all US water systems to remove fluoride from public water".<!-- --></p><p>He alleged the chemical found in toothpaste and regularly used by dentists "is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease".<!-- --></p><p>Most public health experts have rejected these claims and alleged that Kennedy had cited data from studies conducted in countries with far higher levels of fluoride in their water systems than the US has. <!-- --></p><p>The American Dental Association sharply criticised Utah for its decision, saying that it shows "wanton disregard for the oral health and well-being of their constituents".<!-- --></p><p>"It is disheartening to see that a proven, public health policy, which exists for the greater good of an entire community's oral health, has been dismantled based on distorted pseudoscience," the association's president, Denver dentist Brett Kessler, said in a statement.<!-- --></p><p>Many public health groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have long supported adding small amounts of fluoride to drinking water. <!-- --></p><p>The US Public Health Service reduced the amount of fluoride it recommended adding to water in 2015, but the federal government has encouraged states since the 1960s to add small amounts of the chemical to water to help prevent cavities and aid oral health.<!-- --></p><p>Recent court rulings have led to the reduction of fluoride in US water, and some experts have questioned the continued need for it in water systems given its wide availability in toothpaste and other dental products.<!-- --></p><p>Most of western Europe does not add fluoride to its water. In England, about one in 10 people has fluoridated drinking water, though a programme has since been introduced to fluoridate water for 1.6 million people in north-east England.<!-- --></p><p>By contrast, around 63% of the US population have fluoridated water.<!-- --></p><p>Experts who support putting fluoride in water says studies show that community water fluoridation prevents at least 25% of tooth decay in children and adults.<!-- --></p><p>"The scientific weight of sound evidence around the benefit of community water fluoridation is clear and compelling," the American Dental Association said in October of last year.<!-- --></p><p>Prof Avijit Banerjee, chair of cariology and operative dentistry at King's College London, previously told the BBC that "the potential harmful effects of fluoride cited have not been associated with the very low levels of fluoride used in water fluoridation programmes".<!-- --></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>A</span>t international academic conferences recently, one sees an interesting trend. Some American participants are travelling with <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/712588/what-is-a-burner-phone-and-when-should-you-use-one/" data-link-name="in body link">‚Äúburner‚Äù phones</a> or have minimalist laptops running browsers and not much else. In other words, they are equipped with the same kind of kit that security-conscious people used to bring 15 years ago when travelling to China.</p><p>So what‚Äôs up? Well, these academics have a finger on the pulse of Trump‚Äôs America, and are concerned about what might happen when they return home. They‚Äôve read on <a href="https://robertreich.substack.com/p/if-trump-can-disappear-them-he-can" data-link-name="in body link">Robert Reich‚Äôs Substack</a> about the French scientist who was prevented from entering the country because US Border Patrol agents had found messages from him in which he had expressed his ‚Äúpersonal opinion‚Äù to colleagues and friends about Trump‚Äôs science policies.</p><p>Or they‚Äôve heard about Dr <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/17/brown-university-rasha-alawieh-deported-lebanon" data-link-name="in body link">Rasha Alawieh</a>, a kidney transplant specialist and professor at Brown University who was trying to return to the US after visiting relatives in Lebanon. She was deported, reports Reich, ‚Äúdespite having a valid visa and a court order‚Äù blocking her removal. ‚ÄúFederal authorities alleged that they found ‚Äòsympathetic photos and videos of prominent Hezbollah figures‚Äô in her phone and that she attended the funeral for the leader of Hezbollah in February.‚Äù</p><p>And they also know about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/19/mahmoud-khalil-statement" data-link-name="in body link">Mahmoud Khalil</a>, a Columbia University graduate, whom ‚Äì though he is a legal permanent resident of the US and has not been charged with a crime ‚Äì the government is trying to deport because he had participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia.</p><p>Those pro-Gaza demonstrations so irked the Trump regime that it demanded the return of $400m of federal research funding. When Columbia sought a meeting to discuss the matter, it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/14/nyregion/columbia-letter.html" data-link-name="in body link">received a letter</a> setting out the conditions that it would have to accept before the government would deign to talk. These included a stipulation that Columbia must ‚Äúbegin the process of placing the Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies Department under academic receivership for a minimum of five years‚Äù.</p><p>The bullying of Columbia is the canary in the coalmine which reveals the Trump-Musk junta has it in for American universities. There are two reasons for their hostility. The first is that, as elite institutions devoted to freedom of inquiry and the telling of uncomfortable truths, they are anathema to the new autocrats in Washington. The second is that some of them (the so-called Ivy League) are fabulously wealthy, being for the most part hedge funds with nice universities attached. And if there‚Äôs one thing that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Donald Trump</a> cannot abide, it is large pots of money that he and his ghastly tribe can smell but not touch. So if the aloof trustees of Harvard, Princeton, Yale et al think that their august institutions lie beyond his reach, perhaps they should understand that Trump looks on them much as Henry VIII looked on the rich monasteries of his heyday.</p><p>Many teachers and researchers in US universities are now fearful of what lies ahead. No line of inquiry is safe from the raging firestorm of Maga intolerance. Many of the most vulnerable areas of inquiry lie in the health sector ‚Äì LGBTQ+ medicine, epidemiology, infectious diseases, immunology, and so on. But there‚Äôs also endangered research on environmental issues and the climate crisis, socioeconomic inequality, plus the humanities, social science and astrophysics.</p><p>The looming crisis in the US is beginning to remind people in Europe of the 1930s, when the UK and the US began to realise that Jewish scientists needed to be rescued from the Nazis. About 2,000 scientists and academics fled the fascist countries between 1933 and 1941, fearing for themselves or Jewish family members. Then, universities in the US and the UK made space for and welcomed a whole generation of geniuses ‚Äì Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, Hans Bethe, Max Born, Rudolf Peierls, Francis Simon, to name just a few. Likewise, members of the Frankfurt School were rescued and installed in New York, where they became <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/09/marxist-critique-capitalism-frankfurt-school-cultural-apocalypse" data-link-name="in body link">mightily critical of American capitalism</a> but at least lived to tell their particular tale. As did Thomas Mann.</p><p>Now, in a different age, there are stirrings in Europe to provide safe places for American researchers. In France, Aix-Marseille University is <a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20250315-french-university-opens-doors-to-us-scientists-fleeing-trump-s-research-cuts" data-link-name="in body link">welcoming American scientists</a> whose work has become untenable after the Trump administration‚Äôs cuts in certain academic sectors. The Free University of Brussels (VUB) is opening 12 postdoctoral positions for international researchers, which are <a href="https://www.ddw-online.com/european-universities-offer-scientific-refuge-to-us-researchers-34143-202503/" data-link-name="in body link">open to American researchers</a> working in socially relevant fields. The fellowships come with substantial funding (‚Ç¨2.5m) as part of the European Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie programme. It‚Äôs also aiming to attract American professors looking to relocate. VUB, with its Francophone sister university ULB, is providing 18 apartments for international researchers seeking temporary residence at the Brussels Institute for Advanced Studies.</p><p>This is the beginning of something hopeful. But it also raises the question of what UK institutions are doing to meet the coming challenge. The answer, at the moment, seems to be nothing much. Perhaps that‚Äôs because most of British academia still can‚Äôt get its head around the idea that the US is now an enemy, not an ally, and that the ‚Äúspecial relationship‚Äù is yesterday‚Äôs story.</p><h2 id="what-ive-been-reading">What I‚Äôve been reading</h2><p><strong>How I accidentally got sent Trump‚Äôs Yemen texts<br></strong>Jeffrey Goldberg‚Äôs <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/" data-link-name="in body link">astonishing story</a> about the White House security leak in the <em>Atlantic</em>.</p><p><strong>Philosophy and fatherhood<br></strong><a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2025/03/17/a-curious-tendency-among-western-philosophers/" data-link-name="in body link">A curious tendency among western philosophers</a> explored in an intriguing post by Doug Muir.</p><p><strong>AI has learned to reason ‚Ä¶ <br></strong>‚Ä¶ or has it?
