<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="¶-3839470"><p><span>Caltrain announced at its monthly Board of Directors meeting that regenerative braking on the new trains is generating and sending back to the electric grid approximately 23% of the energy consumed by the system. The new electric trains are outperforming Caltrain’s original projections, which is welcome news for a public agency that holds sustainability as a core value.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Originally estimated to cost approximately $19.5 million annually, Caltrain’s electricity use since the launch of electric service averages 207 MWh on weekdays and 175 MWh on weekends, revising cost estimates to $16.5 million. With the agency expecting approximately $6 million annually in energy credits from the California Air Resources Board’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard Program, the first year of electric service will have lower fuel costs than the previous diesel service. Currently, Caltrain is providing that power to the grid free of charge as there is no legal requirement for the agency to be reimbursed for the energy generated.</span></p><p><span>Regenerative braking is a technology first introduced to electric trains in 1886. They work by driving an electric motor in reverse to recapture energy rather than losing it as heat during braking. Caltrain’s fleet is designed to return that power to the Overhead Contact System (OCS), which feeds it to the nearest traction power facility. From there, it can be used to power other trains on the system or returned to the grid.</span></p><p><span>“Caltrain is running its service on 100% renewable energy and is returning nearly a quarter of that energy to the grid,” said Michelle Bouchard, Caltrain Executive Director. “The new electric fleet is delivering on its promise of state-of-the-art service, living up to our mission of providing sustainable transportation that enhances quality of life for everyone.”</span></p><p><span>###</span></p><p><em><span>About Caltrain: Owned and operated by the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board, Caltrain provides rail service from San Francisco to San Jose, with commute service to Gilroy. Serving the region since 1863, Caltrain is the oldest continually operating rail system west of the Mississippi and the first railroad to convert from diesel to electric power in a generation.&nbsp;</span></em></p><p><em><span>Follow Caltrain on&nbsp;</span></em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/caltrain"><em><span>Facebook</span></em></a><em><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span></em><a href="https://twitter.com/caltrain"><em><span>X</span></em></a><em><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></em></p><p><em><span>Free translation assistance is available.

His administration has abruptly cancelled research-grant reviews, travel and trainings for scientists inside and outside the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the world’s largest public biomedical funder. Adding to the worry: the Trump team appears to have deleted entire webpages about diversity programmes and diversity-related grants from the agency’s site.</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03736-0" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00231-y/d41586-025-00231-y_50471522.jpg"><p>Major biomedical funder NIH poised for massive reform under Trump 2.0</p></a></article><p>The cancelling of meetings and travel is part of a pause in external communications issued on 21 January by the NIH’s parent organization, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Researchers who spoke to <i>Nature</i> say that although a short, daylong pause in communications at US agencies has occurred in the past when new administrations have started, to reorient strategy, the reach and length of the Trump team’s — it is set to last until at least 1 February — is unprecedented. Without advisory-committee meetings, the NIH cannot issue research grants, temporarily freezing 80% of the agency’s US$47-billion budget that funds research across the country and beyond.</p><p>“I’ve never seen anything like this before,” says Carole LaBonne, a developmental biologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, who has received funding from the agency for more than 20 years. The uncertainty caused by the pause will be “devastating for the scientific community”, particularly for early-career researchers, LaBonne adds.</p><p>The pause includes “mass communications and public appearances that are not directly related to emergencies or critical to preserving health”, according to an NIH spokesperson. “This is a short pause to allow the new team to set up a process for review and prioritization.”</p><p>NIH and HHS spokespeople did not respond to queries about whether grant-review panels were considered public appearances and why they were cancelled, or about concerns from researchers that the pause will hinder the agency’s mission.</p><h2>A mission under threat?</h2><p>Typically, the NIH awards research grants after two separate panels of independent specialists in a particular scientific field have reviewed project proposals. On Wednesday, reports emerged on the <a href="https://x.com/gsducker/status/1882176107405013168" data-track="click" data-label="https://x.com/gsducker/status/1882176107405013168" data-track-category="body text link">social-media platforms X</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/liebschutz.bsky.social/post/3lgeaf7bixs2f" data-track="click" data-label="https://bsky.app/profile/liebschutz.bsky.social/post/3lgeaf7bixs2f" data-track-category="body text link">and </a><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/liebschutz.bsky.social/post/3lgeaf7bixs2f" data-track="click" data-label="https://bsky.app/profile/liebschutz.bsky.social/post/3lgeaf7bixs2f" data-track-category="body text link">Bluesky</a> that grant-review panels scheduled prior to 2 February had been cancelled without any indication of when they would be rescheduled.</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00197-x" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00231-y/d41586-025-00231-y_50504258.jpg"><p>What Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science</p></a></article><p>These panels, called ‘study sections’ and ‘advisory councils’, are sometimes scheduled a year in advance and can include more than 30 participating researchers, so it will take time to reschedule and might result in a ‘domino effect’ of cancellations. Researchers awaiting a grant-review decision “may be laid off or forced to seek employment elsewhere if funding is uncertain or delayed”, LaBonne says. Early-career researchers are particularly at risk, “as it can mean missing research milestones and jeopardize hiring, promotion and tenure decisions”, she adds.</p><p>Harold Varmus, a former NIH director who is now a cancer researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, says that putting a hold on communications of new policies when there’s a new presidential administration can make sense. But the extensive remit of the current pause is counter to the agency’s mission, he says. The US Congress allocates budget money to the NIH for funding research, he adds, so “the will of Congress will be challenged if we don’t change what is going on”.</p><p>Esther Choo, an emergency-medicine physician at the Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/choo.bsky.social/post/3lgeks3sp7k2i" data-track="click" data-label="https://bsky.app/profile/choo.bsky.social/post/3lgeks3sp7k2i" data-track-category="body text link">wrote on Bluesky on 22 January</a> that a study section she was supposed to participate in was cancelled this week. As a reviewer on grant proposals, she said, you constantly read ideas for research projects that could be “a game changer in health”. She added: “I hope we get back on track soon. There are real people, real lives waiting on the science.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">To be able to build the v8 engine for zig-js-runtime, you have to install some libs:</p>
<p dir="auto">For Debian/Ubuntu based Linux:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo apt install xz-utils \

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
<article>
    <p>I'm currently drafting this blog post in <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://zed.dev/">Zed</a>. After using Vim/Neovim for more than 15
years, I recently decided to try out something new. I don't know if this little
experiment will work, or if I'll run back to my trusty Neovim, but hey, what I do know
is that I'd like to find out.</p>
<h2 id="why-try-something-else">Why try something else?</h2>
<p>Why though? If you've used a specific tool for that long, why (try to) switch to
something else anyway? Everyone has their own reasons. I have two.</p>
<h3 id="1-the-desire-to-use-something-that-just-works">1. The desire to use something that just works</h3>
<p>Lately, I've been drifting towards things that "just work".</p>
<p>I love (Neo)Vim. Like I wrote earlier, it's been my primary editor for the past 15
years. What I don't love is all the configuration that goes into it before I can use it
to start writing code.</p>
<p>When I first started using Vim (in 2009!), my configuration was a tiny <code>.vimrc</code> file
that was handed over to me by my internship supervisor at that time. I had no idea what
it did, but it worked. Over time, as I felt the need to customize things, my <code>.vimrc</code>
started accumulating increasingly more code copied from StackOverflow that I didn't
understand.</p>
<p>At some point Neovim came out, and with it, the ability to configure things using Lua.
This was a huge step up, because I could at least understand what I was configuring.</p>
<p>Either way, it's still configuration. What changed was just <em>how</em> that configuration was
done. The combination of configuring the base editor and installing a set of plugins
(and making sure that they play nice with each other) isn't really something that I
would like to spend my time on, going forward.</p>
<p>One recent example that highlights this problem: my workflow consists of switching
back and forth between a terminal window and an editor window. At any time, I have
multiple projects open in both. On macOS, it's been difficult to find a solution that
"just works". The most popular Neovim GUI clients on macOS include <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/qvacua/vimr">Vimr</a> and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://neovide.dev/">Neovide</a>,
which are both excellent projects. Neovide though, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/neovide/neovide/issues/1332">does not support multiple windows</a>,
which is integral to my workflow and hence requires me to implement <a href="https://sgoel.dev/posts/switching-between-projects-in-neovim/">workarounds</a>, which
actually broke last week after I ran <code>:PackerUpdate</code>. And while Vimr does support
multiple windows, it is <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/qvacua/vimr/issues/887">not able to render icons in nvim-tree</a>, which is less than
ideal. 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>
<h3 id="2-deeper-and-native-llm-integration">2. Deeper and native LLM integration</h3>
<p>LLMs are happening, whether we like it or not. And no, the fact that they aren't 100%
correct all the time is not a reason to discard them entirely. I understand why some
people don't want to use them. And I respect that. I personally find them useful and
would like to integrate them more into my daily workflow.</p>
<p>The Neovim ecosystem has a bunch of plugins for using LLMs. But as I wrote in the
previous section, I'd like to avoid plugins when possible. Installing plugins means
updating them, which inevitably breaks things.</p>
<p>One example where I find LLMs useful when coding is handling boilerplate stuff. In my
current Neovim setup, I have the the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium.nvim">Codeium extension</a> installed, which offers code
suggestions that are like an autocomplete on steroids. Often, I can write a function
name and what parameters it's expecting, and the LLM writes out the function for me.
This is particularly helpful when writing small functions or test cases.</p>
<p>I'd like to be able to do more of such things in my editor. I'm not entirely sold on the
idea of agentic editors, as I'd like to keep at least <em>some</em> agency over the code that's
going in, but that's a different topic.</p>
<p>Another example of where I find LLMs useful: I'm not a native English speaker and often
struggle to find the right sentence framing that is both concise and catchy. LLMs are
excellent at this! I can scribble my initial thoughts, throw it at an LLM and ask it to
reframe the whole thing, which is great!</p>
<p>Generally, it feels like the way we're writing code is changing with the introduction of
this extremely powerful tool, and I'd like to move with the times.</p>
<h2 id="why-zed">Why Zed?</h2>
<p>So yeah, those are the two reasons why I've been looking to try out something else
lately. What made me go for Zed?</p>
<h3 id="1-vim-mode">1. Vim mode</h3>
<p>Yep, that's literally the first reason. After using Vim for 15 years, my fingers have
built up enough muscle memory that not using Vim keybindings when writing code is
downright impossible.</p>
<p>Zed's <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://zed.dev/docs/vim">Vim mode</a> is surprisingly solid! So far, I feel right at home. Almost all Vim
keybindings that I'm used to work just as expected. The one or two bindings that don't
work, are something that I can make my peace with and retrain my fingers on. Everything
else works excellent. It also looks like they're <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://zed.dev/blog/vim-2025">doubling down on their Vim mode</a>
support in 2025, which is a great sign!</p>
<h3 id="2-it-just-works">2. It just works</h3>
<p>When you fire up Zed, the editor is fully functional without having to write a single
line of configuration. That's awesome. The editor may prompt you every now and then to
install support for specific languages. But that's usually just one button click.</p>
<h3 id="3-json-configuration">3. JSON Configuration</h3>
<p>Lua is great, but one JSON file is even better. Zed uses JSON as the configuration
syntax and so far it feels a lot simpler than what I've worked with so far.</p>
<h3 id="4-configuration-autocomplete">4. Configuration autocomplete</h3>
<p>I had no idea I needed this until I had it!</p>
<p><img src="https://sgoel.dev/posts/trying-out-zed-after-more-than-a-decade-of-vim-neovim/zed-configuration-autocomplete.png" alt=""></p>
<p>While editing the Zed configuration file, I found it really helpful how the editor
suggests configuration keys and their potential values. This feature felt really
thoughtful when I first saw it and I could imagine that it goes a long way in getting
new users up to speed quicker.</p>
<h3 id="5-native-llm-integration">5. Native LLM integration</h3>
<p>I know some people have been turned off by this, but I actually like this feature.</p>
<p>Zed has a feature called Assistant, which is a tool to, well, assist you, using a large
language model of your choice. A few popular LLM providers are supported. Once set up,
you can open up the Assistant panel to work together with the language model you've
chosen. For instance, it's pretty easy to type in questions in the panel window and then
paste text from your open file buffers into it to give the LLM more context. There's a
lot more to this feature that I haven't used yet, but I'll probably get to it the more I
use it.</p>
<p>Overall, the integration feels very native and very useful.</p>
<h3 id="6-fast">6. Fast!</h3>
<p>Last but definitely not the least is speed! Zed is <em>very</em> fast. Everything feels very
snappy, and it's clear that the team has put a lot of effort into making everything
fast.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It's only been a day since I really started using Zed instead of Neovim as my daily
driver. And so far the experience has been quite nice.</p>
<p>Like I wrote earlier, this is an experiment. We'll see how things turn out. That being
said though, the first impression looks <strong>very</strong> good.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>This column doesn’t offer investment advice, as I am not a registered investment advisor. This is not merely a mandatory disclaimer; this is a warning. We will discuss some specific securities below that I am not <em>merely incapable</em> of recommending.</p><p>Finance performs a strange alchemy, teleporting value through time and space. Ordinarily, Bits about Money focuses more on the plumbing of it than the deals. But a deal enthusiast who goes by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/theconservativeincomeinvestor">The Conservative Income Investor</a> recently flagged a capital raise to me. It has everything: echoes of the culture that is the American PMC 2020-2024, complex financial structuring, a novel web application to move money, a crypto company in the background, and municipal politics. So it seems squarely within this column’s beat.</p><p>The municipality happens to be Chicago, my hometown and (after a 20 year stint in Japan) current residence. And so I feel some sense of civic duty, as a Chicagoan, taxpayer, and reasonably financially sophisticated person, to say the following publicly: <em>What the hell, Chicago.</em></p><p>But before we get to present-day shenanigans, we need to go back several decades, because municipal politics is inextricable from the shenanigans.</p><h2 id="chicago-has-wanted-a-casino-for-a-long-time">Chicago has wanted a casino for a long time</h2><p>Chicago and the state of Illinois more broadly have a deeply unserious polity. It has mortgaged its future through consistently overpaying public sector employees (principally, in Chicago, police/fire/teachers) and undertaxing. Neither decreasing total compensation of public sector employees nor reneging on previously-negotiated deferred compensation (pensions and healthcare for retirees) nor raising taxes to appropriate levels is considered politically palatable. One reason is that the <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/commission/lrb/conent.htm">Illinois state constitution</a> (Article 13 Section 5) makes public employee pensions sacrosanct. The constitution is, of course, not a fact of nature; it is a political compromise by, again, a deeply unserious polity.</p><p>Long-time watchers of state and local politics know Illinois pensions are the <a href="https://www.illinoispolicy.org/illinois-needs-responsible-tier-2-pension-reform/">worst funded in the nation</a>, state officials <a href="https://www.illinois.gov/news/press-release.26105.html">celebrate</a> when Wall Street upgrades its <a href="https://illinoiscomptroller.gov/financial-reports-data/data-sets-portals/illinois-bond-debt">credit rating</a> from close-to-junk, and the possibility of a federal bailout was a constant political issue for decades until it <a href="https://cookcountyrecord.com/stories/619617113-credit-200b-federal-bailout-not-pritzker-s-actions-for-improved-2023-il-budget">happened by stealth during covid</a>.</p><p>And so Illinois and Chicago specifically are constantly on the make for new revenue streams. One which was mooted <a href="https://repryanspain.com/2024/02/07/looking-back-riverboat-gambling-enacted-in-illinois-february-7-1990/">since my childhood in the 1980s</a> was an expansion of gambling. So-called sin taxes (on gambling, liquor, tobacco, and similar) are politically attractive because they do not cause as much opposition as raising consumption or property taxes.</p><p>And so Chicago has had a decades-long campaign to build a casino within city limits. Why couldn’t Chicago actually get this done in several decades? One reason is the usual incompetence. The other reason is that the political economy of casinos is controversial. Many policies create winners and losers, but casinos inescapably create losers <em>much more directly </em>than most policies up for vote. Local political elites often band together against them, worried about siphoning money from local consumers. They also worry that they tend to create spillover effects, such as crime and moral collapse among a portion of patrons.</p><p>And so, as I once mentioned in a <a href="https://www.thinkingpoker.net/2020/12/episode-341-patrick-mckenzie/">podcast with Thinking Poker</a>, pro-casino political coalitions try to pick off anti-casino political elites by assuaging their concerns and/or bribing them. (In Japan, the de facto concession was “We’ll limit the amount Japanese people can lose here and maximize for soaking Chinese tourists. Now, let’s write that down in a way which doesn’t say exactly that, because it sounds bad if you put it that way.”)</p><p>In Chicago, much of the opposition came from African American political elites. They had the usual set of concerns for casinos, plus one other which is slightly more idiosyncratic. A belief with wide currency in that community is that the community would be much more wealthy than it currently is, but for vice entrepreneurs siphoning that community’s resources out of the community. This belief has lead to e.g. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-11/south-los-angeles-korean-liquor-protest-leimert-park-riots">pogroms</a> against Korean liquor store owners. I direct interested readers to histories of the Rodney King riots or the Asian American experience in 20th century America. (This was covered extensively in an elective I took more than 20 years ago, and so I have since forgotten the academic citations for this true but parenthetical point.)</p><p>Bally’s <a href="https://seminoletribune.org/ballys-wins-bid-for-chicago-casino/">won the bid</a> for the newly licensed Chicago casino in 2022, in part due to offering the right mix of concessions and inducements in its <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/chicago-casino/home/hca.html">Host Community Agreement</a>. One of those was promising Chicago that the new casino would be at least 25% owned by women and Minorities. The M is capital in the Chicago municipal code, and I will preserve this stylistic choice, because the word does not mean what most educated Americans assume it means. We shall return to that meaning later.</p><h2 id="the-stock-offering">The stock offering</h2><p>In fulfillment of its obligations under the HCA, Bally’s Chicago, Inc., an entity in the corporate web which will build and operate the casino, has <a href="http://ballyschicagoinvest.com/">conducted a stock offering</a> since December. It runs through January 2025.</p><p>The stock offering has a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1935799/000110465924132193/tm2310971-13_s1a.htm">prospectus</a> associated with it. BCI does not appear to be relying on an exemption from registration, in the fashion that e.g. most startups would, restricting them to raising money from accredited investors.</p><p>While reading the prospectus, I read a <a href="https://wirepoints.org/no-white-men-allowed-in-ballys-chicago-share-offering-promoted-by-city-officials-wirepoints/">much-remarked-upon</a> statement, and assumed it was a misprint.</p><p><em>This offering is only being made to individuals and entities that satisfy the Class A Qualification Criteria (as defined herein). Our Host Community Agreement with the City of Chicago requires that 25% of Bally’s Chicago OpCo’s equity must be owned by persons that have satisfied the Class A Qualification Criteria. The Class A Qualification Criteria include, among other criteria, that the person:</em></p><ul><li><em>if an individual, must be a woman;</em></li><li><em>if an individual, must be a Minority, as defined by MCC 2-92-670(n) (see below); or</em></li><li><em>if an entity, must be controlled by women or Minorities.</em></li></ul><p>Why did I assume this was a mistake? Well, for one thing, on the face of it Bally’s has told the SEC that this offering is only available to Minorities who are <em>also</em> women, which does not match the intent expressed elsewhere or during their roadshow. I have immense sympathy for drafting errors. Bally’s, feel free to let the lawyers know they forgot a significant “or” on the first bullet point. [<em>Post-publication edit</em>: An actual lawyer, not an Internet lawyer, informs me that the first bullet point has an implied "or" in this construction. Mea maxima culpa, associate who drafted this.] </p><p>The other reason I thought this was likely a mistake is that the American social, legal, and constitutional order is profoundly opposed to discrimination by race, and considers that action <em>malum in se</em>. Even when individual actors <em>want</em> to do it, they usually feel embarrassed enough about it to dissemble.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the last few years tech companies <a href="https://x.com/patio11/status/1678235882481127427">absolutely</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/youtube-hiring-for-some-positions-excluded-white-and-asian-males-lawsuit-says-1519948013">notoriously</a> engaged in legally prohibited discrimination in hiring, sometimes as an intentionally directed and explicitly written down policy. This is often assumed to be a conspiracy theory by disaffected white males. Perhaps that is an understandable belief, since people who read the project plans either a) supported them or b) value their future careers and are therefore mostly not leaking them, and thus we only have public evidence of those project plans which end up screenshotted in litigation. Similarly, when I say that the state of California <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-story-of-vaccinateca/">proudly engaged in redlining in the provision of lifesaving medical care</a> in 2021, many people of good-will assume that I simply <em>must</em> be mistaken.&nbsp;<em>I get it, but I was there.</em></p><p>Returning from the ancient history of 2021 to this very week: Chicago has directed a private entity to segregate, and that entity is segregating, principally via web application. If you attempt to engage Bally’s for an investment here, you will see the following blocking question during qualification stages for the investment opportunity. (The web application will also ask for your name, address, social security number, and accredited investor status.)</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfg7xfR4JSU8RMO64xkyKGTLWjifriOMQebvfwoKv_w6Dfuf_jMUft-B571gxvoZhURUfagRAC-sJ-8K6-KSEkW-1Ywd0LrxaU17bdMDnVoC2f5M8mqheigRD5aLWfe93jD5uoHsg?key=JKwqz4E9flWfAud9N2aVoVGT" alt="" loading="lazy" width="624" height="328"></figure><p>There is a right answer to this question. If you give the wrong answer, Bally’s will decline you the opportunity to invest. You get entirely stopped by the web application.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfglxb7-tKG8dxnItCIa0JYtrPBdxwGifDpBb1CGIt0aHXgW2I9yb4OVatYhUvQKrIGAMXReQWx8HIuG2-Rf8t7jYAfG2EaQFKhth-dOfbeiTUB-gQDLkIY-lUu3uK3tuGYI6tQGg?key=JKwqz4E9flWfAud9N2aVoVGT" alt="" loading="lazy" width="624" height="87"></figure><p>I express no opinion on whether this is legal, by Bally’s or Chicago. After all, I am not a lawyer, and this has certainly been seen by many lawyers at this point, in e.g. preparing the submission to the SEC. Presumably all of them went through 1L courses which introduced concepts like the <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, case law which says government actions discriminating by race are <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12391">subject to strict scrutiny</a>, and case law which says that the government cannot proxy through a private entity to do things it is prohibited to do itself. And clearly no one admitted to the bar in Illinois thinks that Chicago can waive the U.S. Constitution if it considers that politically advantageous to get a gridlocked casino through municipal politics.</p><p>So I will charitably assume the existence of a memo where competent professionals have laid out a case for the legality of this course of action. They must have concluded that no future Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, not even in an administration elected after the Host Community Agreement had been inked, would descend upon this official act like the hammer of an avenging god.</p><p>As Matt Levine <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-01-23/crypto-perpetual-motion-machines?srnd=undefined">beat me to observing</a>: <em>awkward timing</em>.</p><h2 id="chicago%E2%80%99s-peculiar-definition-of-minority">Chicago’s peculiar definition of Minority</h2><p>Long-time observers of Chicago politics might opine that the city very rarely does anything without creating a carveout for politically connected individuals. The local phrase for this sort of social connection is having “clout” or, sometimes, “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Achicagotribune.com+%22is+clouted%22">is clouted</a>.” You can find examples of the sort of carveouts Chicago reserves for the clouted in the professional histories of the board members of Bally’s Chicago, Inc, for example, which are included in the prospectus.</p><p>So what’s the carveout here? The definition of a racial or ethnic minority is a legendarily contentious one in U.S. politics, largely because inclusion or exclusion from it makes one eligible (or ineligible) for concrete benefits. Sites of contention often include e.g. are Asian Americans a minority, or are e.g. Cuban Americans Hispanic, etc.</p><p>Chicago leaves itself an out for its definition of Minority, which <em>lets it designate any individual or group as a Minority</em>, on an ad hoc, unreported, unaccountable basis. That sounds like I must be strawmanning Chicago. See the below screenshot and explanation in the prospectus</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd253IewOivwCOqOI6zIiGgkVhxz_c5RJK1KsrkT8aRGtEbZ3FGTl4mh6-bwfpWCvSehDTDJtsL4mxrHOWrAnq5KzAvEFxudIHBpBU1ykYmsTuLt1mvzyrOVnRsWGfEzNcREf1L?key=JKwqz4E9flWfAud9N2aVoVGT" alt="" loading="lazy" width="624" height="149"></figure><p>Quoting the prospectus:</p><p><em>Qualification under [the final] clause is determined on a case-by-case basis and there is no exhaustive or definitive list of groups or individuals that the City of Chicago has determined to qualify as Minority under this clause. However, in the event the City of Chicago identifies any additional groups or individuals as falling under this clause in the future, members of such groups would satisfy the Class A Qualification Criteria.</em></p><p>Now, fairminded people reading “groups… found by the City of Chicago to be socially disadvantaged by having suffered racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias within American society” would note “Well, OK, on the face of it, that definitely includes e.g. Jewish Americans or Irish Americans. We have some lamentable history as a nation and city, sure. But no intellectually serious person in the United States considers Irish Americans ‘a racial or ethnic minority’ <em>in the common usage of the term</em>.” And thus, the capitalization of Minority.</p><p>You’ll have to ask the city for their list of ad hoc exceptions made under this bullet point. Long-time watchers of Chicago municipal politics, however, might say that asking is of limited utility.</p><p>I will note that, as a matter of engineering fact, the web application will blithely accept self-certification under this bullet point <em>for anyone</em>. You are welcome to your guess as to whether Bally’s or any city employee will review the 1,000 investors individually and, if they review them, what the process is for determining whether e.g. a particular Patrick counts as a Minority or not.&nbsp;</p><p>I’d wager there is no process at all here. It seems like a better bet than most offered in the casino.</p><h2 id="reading-a-complex-corporate-structure">Reading a complex corporate structure</h2><p>Bally’s Chicago is a product of Bally’s, a publicly traded company. You can read <a href="https://www.ballys.com/investor-relations/financials/default.aspx">their 10-Ks</a>. According to their <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001747079/e72243a7-c47d-4ca7-a9fc-e91f8f95fb18.pdf">most recent quarterly report</a>, they operate 15 casinos across the U.S., and have substantial online gambling operations. Like many casinos, they are <em>somewhat</em> diversified, insofar as a casino resort also functions as a hotel and restaurant/bar/etc venue.</p><p>Bally’s Chicago has a complex capital stack, which one would probably need to understand to evaluate the opportunity to invest in it. I am not saying “complex” as a criticism: this is fairly ho hum by the standards of large commercial real estate developments, a subject I am not an expert on but <a href="https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com/episodes/the-hundred-year-old-telegram-worth-5-million-with-jim-mckenzie-2/">grew up hearing about at the dinner table</a>. I <em>am</em> heavily implying that I would not expect a Chicagoan picked at random, or for that matter an alderman, to be able to look at the following diagram and correctly describe what it means. Prospectus, ibid, pg 145.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfakivtPLtYz2pNNM_02Trf7NJnNR1aZxaCHrGIHSGTyFPtA-twKGNOYJxcLqEQ0jEtYeRM13SqSlScqLvOVP-p171kC1nafdnNxXToDe6XwJ38R2fv2p1p3Wj-1j1O4ucLt7RiOg?key=JKwqz4E9flWfAud9N2aVoVGT" alt="" loading="lazy" width="624" height="408"></figure><p>The entity which Chicago is stumping for is Bally’s Chicago, Inc. (BCI), the central square on that diagram. <s>Marks</s> investors are receiving ownership in <em>that entity</em>, not in <em>the casino</em>, which will be operated by Bally’s Chicago Operating Company, LLC (BCOC). That entity gets 25% economic interest in the future profits (insert <em>very material</em> asterisk here) of the casino; the other 75% flows to Bally’s Chicago Holding Company, LLC (BCHC). BCHC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bally’s, Inc, the publicly traded company.</p><p>When one offers someone the opportunity to invest in something, one has to decide upon a valuation for the something. The price of a slice of the pie is set in notional reference to the price of the whole pie.</p><p>Bally’s says that its good faith guesstimate on the whole pie is the economic interest in future profits of the Chicago casino is… <em>a billion dollars exactly</em>. The prospectus, as is wont for these situations, disclaims floridly that that price might not be accurate. One example of many: “We made a number of assumptions to determine the price of our Class A Interests. If any of our assumptions are incorrect, including our assumptions regarding the total enterprise value of the Company, then the Class A Interests will be worth less than the price stated in this prospectus. In such case, the return on investment or rate of return on an investment in our Class A Interests could be significantly below an investor’s expectation.”</p><p>Bally’s will, as is standard and customary for this sort of thing, pretend that investors have read and understood the ~200 page prospectus, and civil society will pretend to believe them.</p><p>It isn’t <em>extremely</em> <em>improper</em> to pick a billion dollars out of one’s hindquarters as an investment valuation. That particular number exerts a sort of memetic quality in e.g. Silicon Valley, and there are legendary amounts of negotiation between sophisticated parties to accept just a bit more structure to get a e.g. $920 million valuation to a $1 billion valuation, because so-called unicorn status is good for PR, for attracting prospective employees, and (a real factor) for founder ego.</p><p>But if you invest at a valuation not justified by the fundamentals of the investment, you will tend to underperform. This is an inescapable fact of investing. (And that is why the sophisticated investors, accepting a “worse” valuation, want “better” structure to compensate for it.)</p><p>And this partially explains why Chicago is holding a roadshow in African American churches attempting to convince participants to invest in a mezzanine-y equity slice of a casino at a $1 billion valuation, perhaps at 100X leverage. (I tip my cap to <a href="https://thetriibe.com/2025/01/chicagos-black-residents-can-invest-in-ballys-casino/">publicly available reporting</a> of the roadshow.) And not, for example, attempting to convince Goldman Sachs to put together some sophisticated investors and take down the $250 million allocation.</p><h2 id="is-this-valuation-a-gift-to-investors">Is this valuation a gift to investors?</h2><p>Chicago’s pitch to investors, delivered (per above reporting by Triibe) by “City Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin and members of the Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus”, emphasizes the potential of creating “generational wealth” (direct quote) with this casino investment. This point of view aligns with the above described political economy of attempting to buy off influential communities and/or community elites with an equity carveout, which successfully got this particular casino through decades of political gridlock.</p><p>And so the investment case <em>implies</em> that Bally’s is intentionally giving takers something for nothing. That is, they must be sandbagging the valuation they assigned to this bundle of rights: it’s not really worth $1 billion, it is worth e.g. $5 billion. Only you favored Chicagoans well-loved by your alderman are able to buy at the non-market price, leading to essentially free money. Not merely small amounts of it, either. Generational. Wealth.</p><p>The pitch very likely explicitly said the requisite words about this being a risky investment, wink wink, and very definitely described an opportunity for extreme levels of leverage and a lengthy expected road to ROI, which we’ll return to in a moment.</p><p>Do I think sophisticated investors would agree with Bally’s that this bundle of rights is worth $1 billion? <strong>Reader, I do not.</strong></p><p>One reason is the perception of an absence: why is this pitch being given to individual savers in a church at a minimum investment of $250, and not in a swank office to an entity capable of committing $25 million? But perhaps I’m just suspicious.</p><p>No, let’s go to more direct evidence: if 25% of this bundle of rights is worth $250 million, then 75% must be worth $750 million, right? And if an entity owning 75% of the bundle, Bally’s, also owns 14 other casinos, online gambling properties, and similar, then that entity must be worth a lot more than $750 million, right?</p><p><strong>The market does not agree with this assessment</strong>. The entire market capitalization of Bally’s (NYSE: BALY) is, as of this writing, ~$1.5 billion. What’s the difference between the $50 million average imputed value of the other casinos and the $750 million imputed value of the Chicago casino?<strong> The $750 million is <em>made up</em>, that’s what.</strong></p><p>And, again, the <em>real unspoken logic</em> of this pitch is that the bundle of rights is getting sold on the cheap, and that it is actually worth much more than $1 billion. It very clearly is not, or sophisticated investors would be swooping in and buying BALY’s common stock. Crack it open like an oyster and dig into that sweet sweet Chicago gambling revenue if you need to!</p><p>This is somewhat elementary and handwavy napkin analysis of a complicated business which, like most casinos and hotels, is heavily levered with a complex capital stack. But the investment case gets smothered by a napkin.</p><h2 id="capital-stack-arbitrage-or-giving-retail-1001-leverage-on-single-stock-issuances">Capital stack arbitrage, or, giving retail 100:1 leverage on single stock issuances</h2><p>The Host Community Agreement, as above, obligates Bally’s to find a way to sell preferred Chicagoans $250 million of stock. This was likely complicated by rich Chicagoans not being suckers and less-well-off Chicagoans not having $250 million lying around.</p><p>And so Bally’s has introduced a novel structure.</p><p>In brief, that structure sells stock to investors on credit, with the credit being extended by Bally’s, and paid down by future dividend distributions of the stock. If you’re very interested in the mechanics, you can find them at length in the prospectus, but the complex legal code is an excuse for this screenshot:</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdd2zG5uipfo6O6HV1VDhABAIppuInvPo-0xgN4q2GRY7I0BwQQ4_vQKB4hw5ft856pfkSflAs76usXl_a6BaOJ6NAXMR8avY1J0U6Tx7tMesCYHXf1XivHTTz8niPJYvQgPsDu?key=JKwqz4E9flWfAud9N2aVoVGT" alt="" loading="lazy" width="624" height="185"></figure><p>What is the “Attributable Subordinated Loan?” I’m glad you asked. Bally’s staked (ba dum bum) BCI with a few hundred million dollars to fund development. Where did it find the money to do that? A mix of equity and debt financing, as is common for virtually all complex commercial real estate transactions. Bally’s, per their <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001747079/0a22a582-5179-4a27-8a24-cbfc84043b0f.pdf">most recent 10-K</a>, has long-term debt from sophisticated investors which costs them 5.x% per year. (It would be more expensive if they wanted to lock that down today.)</p><p>In return for Bally’s advancing BCI money through BCHC, BCI owed BCHC money, on an intercompany IOU. This capital offering cancels that intercompany IOU and replaces it with the Subordinated Loans. The prospectus does not quote the rate that the left pocket of Bally’s charged the right pocket of Bally’s. It does quote the rate for the Subordinated Loans: 11% annually compounding quarterly.</p><p>The road show makes much of the fact that this leverage is non-recourse. Quoting the Triibe reporting again:</p><p><em>The loan is non-recourse, explained Sidney Dillard of Loop Capital Markets, who is the underwriter of the offering, during the information session. “That loan is not recourse, meaning that you are not responsible for it,” she said.</em></p><p>I am not someone who has ever offered SEC registered securities for sale, but I am aware that when one does that, one has to adopt a <em>certain level of care</em> with respect to how one simultaneously a) sells a product that one has to offer and b) describes the operations of that product without wandering into lying.</p><p>And so <em>this writer</em> would not describe “non-recourse” as a loan one is not responsible for. I have a non-recourse mortgage. I am very, very much responsible for paying the mortgage. If I do not pay the mortgage, I expect to swiftly not own the property securing the mortgage. The “non-recourse” bit means that the lender cannot come after your <em>other</em> assets or income, for example by suing you for a judgement, then forcing you to disgorge your savings account or e.g. interests in a wholly owned LLC.</p><p>The Subordinated Loans are, per the prospectus (probably a bit more reliable than the understanding of e.g. Chicago employees on the finer details), not between the owners of the Class-A{1,2,3} equity and any Bally’s entities. They are strictly loans between Bally’s entities themselves. Those loans are senior to Class-A{1,2,3} equity in the payments waterfall of future profits (we need that asterisk again!) from the casino to equity holders. The expectation is that Bally’s will individually book repayments against records which are kept on a per-shareholder basis without actually obligating the shareholder, <em>while keeping the actual cash thrown off by the casino</em>, prior to eventually releasing a shareholder from the indebtedness that Bally’s will say that, technically speaking, they have not actually incurred.</p><p>At that point, the shareholder will own the slice of equity that an unsophisticated listener of that roadshow might think they own free-and-clear.</p><p>Now, Bally’s forecasts that many shareholders will be very underwater on these investments. (Wow, that’s a <em>robust</em> sentence.) Prospectus, ibid, pg 23:</p><p><em>Given the capital intensity of developing, constructing, opening and operating a casino resort project of this scale, we currently expect that Bally’s Chicago OpCo will not have any OpCo cash available for distribution until approximately three to five years after our permanent resort and casino begins operations.</em></p><p>Assuming the most charitable estimate from that range, a Class A-3 shareholder will have $250 of equity securing a notional $25,000 investment and future obligations of approximately $34,000 (three years of compound interest on $24,750). This suggests that the holder’s equity value is <strong>planned to be negative</strong> and that no sophisticated investor would purchase that investment for the $25,000 which the unsophisticated shareholder might believe it to be worth in 3 years. They might be willing to pay something more similar to, hmm, negative nine thousand dollars.</p><p>Seen in that light <em>this offer of investment sounds predatory</em>. But don’t worry, Chicagoans, Bally’s has your back. You do not have to worry about not being able to sell your stock due to its lack of intrinsic value, because you are not able to sell your stock. Prospectus, ibid, pg 179 under heading Shares Eligible For Future Sale, and elsewhere in the document.</p><p>Class A-4 holders, the ones with no notional debt, who purchased their shares for $25,000 cash-on-the-barrel, are not eligible to sell their stock at any time except as allowed by Bally’s to people approved by Bally’s. (I’ll flag that this is not an unusual term in private equities. Bally’s pre-commitment to discriminating racially against future prospective buyers? <em>That’s</em> unusual.)</p><p>Buyers of Class A-{1,2,3} stock are unable to sell until the associated Subordinated Loan is paid off in full.</p><p>One wonders whether senior Chicago officials will be doing a roadshow in 2030 explaining what happened.</p><h2 id="the-casino-will-not-distribute-profits-per-se">The casino will not distribute profits, per se</h2><p>While the natural expectation is that one is participating in the profits of the casino, the prospectus helpfully clarifies that one is not. The "cash available for distribution" does not necessarily correspond 1:1 with profits. It... well. See the discussion on page 22 and 23 of the prospectus, including the excerpt below.</p><p><em>While we and Bally’s Chicago OpCo intend to make distributions equal to 100% of the cash available for distribution and OpCo cash available for distribution, respectively, on a quarterly basis, the actual amount of any distributions may fluctuate depending on our and Bally’s Chicago OpCo’s ability to generate cash from operations and our and Bally’s Chicago OpCo’s cash flow needs, which, among other things, may be impacted by debt service payments on our or Bally’s Chicago OpCo’s senior indebtedness, capital expenditures, potential expansion opportunities and the availability of financing alternatives, the need to service any future indebtedness or other liquidity needs and general industry and business conditions, including the pace of the construction and development of our permanent resort and casino in Chicago. Our Board will have full discretion on how to deploy cash available for distribution, including the payment of dividends. Any debt we or Bally’s Chicago OpCo may incur in the future is likely to restrict our and Bally’s Chicago OpCo ability to pay dividends or distributions, and such restriction may prohibit us and Bally’s Chicago OpCo from making distributions, or reduce the amount of cash available for distribution and OpCo cash available for distribution.</em></p><p>Now, as someone who grew up with a father constantly complaining about sharp operating in Chicago commercial real estate, I can quickly outline about two dozen different ways for one to cause the operating company here to a) transfer money to other corporate entities and b) therefore have less cash available for distribution.</p><p>As a representative but not limiting example, you can probably choose your own marks for technology services from a parent to a great-grandchild subsidiary. Sure, there is some notional expectation that the marks be at arms-length price, but what is the arms-length price for e.g. casino loyalty accounting software and a particular chain's database of existing users? What low-resourced investor could possibly mount a court challenge against <em>the entity with all the data necessary to value that asset</em>. In Las Vegas, a casino has to calculate and diligently communicate the house edge before raking punters. Here... not so much.</p><p>That would require sharp operating... of a sort which is <em>extremely routine</em> in Chicago commercial real estate. This is a constant risk of being the junior partner in a structure, particularly without an aligned senior partner who would be as adversely impacted by sharp operating as you would be. Of course, here the senior partner owns e.g. the database they are renting to the entity that they also control, and so funds available for distribution from that entity might not match the expectations of junior partners.</p><p>Pick your sponsors carefully, folks.</p><h2 id="tax-consequences-of-this-offering">Tax consequences of this offering</h2><p>Suppose, and this is very unlikely because it is illegal (<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/key-topics/margin-accounts">Reg T</a>) but run with it, that one has a typical brokerage account in the United States and, with $250, purchases $25,000 of marketable securities. Those securities periodically throw off dividend payments. One periodically pays one’s brokerage interest, because one has borrowed money from the brokerage to buy those securities on margin.</p><p>In the typical case, one would be taxed upon those interest payments, which are income. One does not simply <em>net</em> one’s margin interest against that income before paying taxes. One instead must itemize, and then one <a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-schedule-a-form-1040">will be able to</a> (on Schedule A) deduct investment expenses, as described in <a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550">Publication 550</a>. Feel free to run this by your accountant; the details get complicated and wonky.</p><p>If one does not itemize, as many lower-income taxpayers do not, one must of course simply pay the tax on the entirety of one’s interest income. If one protests that one does not actually <em>have</em> any interest income, because it has been taken by one’s brokerage to pay margin interest, the IRS will not be maximally sympathetic.</p><p>Bally’s has very creative professionals involved in the structuring of this offering, and realizing the above issue would compromise fitness for purpose, they have… adopted a theory. I will quote that theory, from the prospectus, verbatim. I have taken the liberty of bolding an important bit in the middle of this.</p><p><em>Section 305 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that if a corporation distributes property to some shareholders and other shareholders have an increase in their proportionate interests in the assets or earnings and profits of the corporation, such other shareholders may be deemed to receive a distribution that could be a taxable dividend. In this case, because we and Bally’s expect to treat the Subordinated Loans as “stock” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, “property” distributions will likely be considered to be made to “some shareholders” of Bally’s Chicago, Inc. as payments are made on the Subordinated Loans, and equivalent cash (“property”) distributions will be made with respect to the Class A-4 Interests. In addition, as payments are made on the Subordinated Loans, particularly those that repay the original principal amount of such Subordinated Loans, the proportionate interests of holders of our Class A-1 Interests, Class A-2 Interests and Class A-3 Interests in the assets or earnings and profits of Bally’s Chicago, Inc. may be viewed as increasing. Accordingly, it is possible that such increase could be treated as a deemed distribution under Section 305 of the Code or otherwise as taxable income to such holders under other theories. However, under the Treasury Regulations relating to Section 305 of the Code and other IRS administrative guidance, certain financing arrangements in the form of preferred stock investments that fund a corporation and then are systematically eliminated through property distributions until they are fully retired, and are designed to facilitate the ownership of a business with an effect of increasing another stockholder’s proportionate interests in the assets or earnings and profits of a corporation over such period, do not result in a deemed distribution to such other stockholder. The applicability of these authorities to the holders of our Class A-1 Interests, Class A-2 Interests and Class A-3 Interests in this situation is uncertain. <strong>Although the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position, and this discussion assumes, that U.S. Holders of applicable series of Class A Interests would not be treated as receiving a deemed distribution from us or otherwise realizing income as a result of repayment of the Subordinated Loans corresponding to such shares. However, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a contrary position</strong>, for example, treating the proportionate interest in our earnings and profits owned by U.S. Holders of the applicable series of Class A Interests as having increased upon repayment of the Subordinated Loans corresponding to such shares, and treating such U.S. Holders as having received a distribution. In that case, such deemed distribution will be taxable as a dividend, return of capital or capital gain as described above under “— Distributions,” and U.S. Holders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax without the receipt of any cash. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors about the application of Code Section 305 and any other potential deemed receipt of income risk with respect to our Class A Interests .</em></p><p>Now, I’m neither a lawyer, tax accountant, nor am I someone who listened carefully to the roadshow when it doubtlessly stepped through this for the benefit of the audience. But here’s what it means:</p><p>Bally’s is taking the position, though they acknowledge that the IRS might disagree, that owners of the Class A-{2,3,4} interests aren’t <em>actually</em> getting any income until the Subordinated Loans have been paid in full. This means that they don’t have to pay income taxes in years where they are not actually receiving cash distributions.</p><p>No, they wait until the Subordinated Loan is paid in full, and then immediately owe income taxes in one whack, at the difference between their basis in the stock (say, $250) and the then-FMV of the stock (say, $25,000). Resulting in Bally’s diligently filing a document with the IRS saying that e.g. a lower-income Chicagoan has just received a bit less than $25,000 in income from them, and should probably pay taxes on it. You can, of course, receive income without receiving <em>immediately available</em> <em>cash</em>; it happens all the time in tech, and is the cause of much structuring to avoid the consequences of it, which can be painful for e.g. early career employees.&nbsp;</p><p>Those taxes will be paid substantially out-of-pocket, because there is almost no conceivable universe where a stock of an actual healthy operating enterprise worth e.g. $25,000 pays an ordinary dividend of e.g. $5,000. The market would adjust the value of the stock upwards to account for the extraordinarily rich stream of dividends, which would adjust the tax bill upwards.</p><p>Financially sophisticated investors might prepare for a tax bomb like this by e.g. borrowing against the value of the stock. That’s basically impossible for this issuance, due to the stock not being publicly listed, the restrictions on transfer, small dollar amounts, etc. The other option is, of course, selling the stock, to whomever Bally’s deigns to approve.</p><p>Tax-motivated transactions are, of course, <em>motivated transactions</em>, and the lucky buyer will probably be able to extract a bit of a deal, doubly so because they are likely much more sophisticated than the initial buyer of the stock, and they have less risk to account for (because of e.g. several years of operating history of the casino before the tax bomb explodes).</p><h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2><p>I am not an investment advisor, and not your investment advisor. I am, however, a recreational poker player who lives in Chicago. I intend to periodically donate money to the Chicago economy by making poor decisions on the river at Bally’s Chicago. </p><p>I do not, however, presently intend to participate in Bally’s stock offering, nor do I presently intend to buy their common stock.</p><p>I will note, out of an overabundance of scrupulousness, that I own a tiny amount of MGM stock, which is a direct competitor to Bally’s. I caught the poker bug at a conference in Las Vegas (hosted at the Tropicana, since acquired by Bally’s and then <a href="https://www.ballys.com/news/news-details/2024/Tropicana-Las-Vegas-Implosion-to-Make-Way-for-the-As-Ballpark-and-Ballys-Entertainment-Resort-Destination-2024-9NZuey6eTG/default.aspx">brought down in a controlled implosion</a>).</p><p>MGM, across the street, actually had poker tables. I have had many enjoyable post-conference excursions staying at their hotel to (in several but not all years) lose money at those tables. I bought the stock for the same reason I buy stock in every hotel, airline, bank, and similar I use: in the unlikely event a not-particularly-high-stakes poker player has a routine customer service complaint, Investor Relations is available as an escalation strategy, over e.g. hotel staff who might be long-since inured to listening to complaints from people who lost money in a casino.</p><p>Oh yeah, I mentioned that there is a crypto angle to this. The registrar and transfer agent for offering 100:1 leverage to retail investors on a casino stock is, see prospectus pg 41, <a href="https://www.bitgo.com/">BitGo Trust</a>. If I had made up that detail, as a crypto skeptic, you might have accused me of being a bit on the nose.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="what-internet-will-look-like-in-the-future">What Internet Will Look Like in the Future</h2><blockquote><p>cripes does anybody remember Google People</p><p>– qntm, <a href="https://twitter.com/qntm/status/1164301933949128709">August 21st, 2019</a></p></blockquote><p>Does anybody remember <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/">PhysicsForums</a>?</p><p>It was never exactly the center of the Internet, but back when it was founded in 2001, the Internet didn’t really <em>have</em> a center the way it does today. PhysicsForums was one forum among thousands, founded by an enthusiastic teenager named Greg Bernhardt, existing in the ‘hard science’ niche alongside the likes of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050105042334/http://www.badastronomy.com/phpBB/index.php">Bad Astronomy</a>, mostly focused on giving hints for physics homework to struggling students without outright <em>doing</em> the physics homework. It had fairly steady growth until 2012, before petering out throughout the 2010s and 2020s in lieu of more centralized sites like StackExchange, and by 2025, only a small community was left. But, unlike so many other fora from back in the early days, it went from 2003 to 2025 without ever changing its URLs, erasing its old posts, or going down altogether. Thanks to this consistency, PhysicsForums remains quite valuable as a time capsule, and can give us a glimpse at how people thought and what they said two decades ago.</p><p>For instance, we we might go to <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/spreadsheet-for-hp-50g-import-export-excel-calc.199904/">this 2007 post</a> asking about the capabilities of the now-obsolete <a href="https://commerce.hpcalc.org/50g.php">HP 50g Graphing Calculator</a>, and read a very helpful reply by commenter ravenprp:</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/PhysicsForums/2007 - ravenprp 0.png" alt="user ravenprp claims to be a large language model in a forum post dated 2007" title="user ravenprp claims to be a large language model in a forum post dated 2007"></p><p>Something has gone terribly wrong.</p><h2 id="quoth-the-raven">Quoth the Raven?</h2><blockquote><p>I reset my pw and logged back in to Google People for the first time in 10 (?) years just now and discovered the following:</p><ol><li>10 years of updates on my account, written by me</li></ol><p>– qntm, <a href="https://twitter.com/qntm/status/1170471878642872321">September 7th, 2019</a></p></blockquote><p>At first glance, ravenprp is a very impressive user, writing 2,891 posts in a mere seven-month span (from September 2006 to April 2007) for average of more than thirteen posts per day. And most of these weren’t casual one-line answers: reading his profile, one comes away realizing that he’s a true <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryScientist">omnidisciplinary scientist</a>, if not a modern-day Renaissance Man. He’s a <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/instructional-robot-design-project.112146/#post-6998564">member of a university faculty</a>, a <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/how-do-you-measure-vibration-decay-in-damped-drumsticks.209340/#post-6999271">mechanical engineering student</a>, and a <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/what-are-the-essential-job-roles-in-a-basic-chemical-plant.164542/#post-6998735">hiring manager at a chemical plant</a> (presumably in <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/chem-eng-hot-career-option-for-canada.180877/#post-6998683">Canada</a>); he’s an expert in <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/looking-for-an-expert-with-vob-and-audio-files.134862/#post-6996856">working with .VOB and audio files</a> and <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/what-are-the-differences-between-bolts-screws-and-hi-lok-fasteners.154763/#post-6999349">fasteners</a>; he’s a <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/solving-multiple-couples-in-structural-engineering-analysis.188652/#post-6999291">structural engineer</a>, <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/take-your-side-dawkins-vs-dyson-debate.185437/#post-6998019">biologist</a>, <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/topical-webpage-title-what-are-the-best-freeware-options-for-medical-physics.198806/#post-6996805">medical physicist</a>, <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/optimize-your-sports-drink-with-advanced-chemist-suggestions-lemonade-flavor.130493/post-6997583">chemist</a>, and <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/air-frame-life-extension-f-15-problem.209836/#post-6999274">aerospace engineer</a>. And to top it all off, he’s modest, and won’t claim expertise he doesn’t have: he’s an aerospace and aeronautical engineer, but <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/an-aerodynamic-simulation-using-panel-method.197033/#post-6999260">not an expert in aerodynamics</a>, nor a <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/how-can-i-calculate-the-failure-load-for-a-cantilevered-hoist-assembly.177574/#post-6999314">mechanical engineer</a>, nor an <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/equivalent-electrical-model-for-spring-damper-circuit-seeking-advice.161781/#post-6998922">expert in electrical models</a>.</p><p>Impressively, these posts span from three years before the account was created to a year after the account was last logged into. And, as the icing on the cake, ravenprp is prescient enough that he can joke about being a language model developed by OpenAI, seven years before OpenAI was even founded; evidently he should have joined PsychicsForums instead.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/PhysicsForums/Ravenprp Collage.png" alt="user Ravenprp's many storied careers as a screenshot" title="user Ravenprp's many storied careers as a screenshot"></p><p>A reasonable question, reading these posts, is: what’s the deal with the joined and login dates? If this is an entirely fabricated account, then why not just set the account creation date to be earlier than the first post, and the account access date to be later than the last post? The Wayback Machine gives us an answer: while the account currently lists 2,891 posts, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190226113743/https://www.physicsforums.com/members/ravenprp.56793/">archive from 2019</a> lists 74. And looking at only these 74 gives a very different profile: ravenprp was an electrical engineering student asking for simple advice on <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/matlab-question-book-software-tools.141015/">MATLAB books</a>, working through <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/using-555-timer-ic-to-output-100-khz-frequency.141013/#post-1144566">integrated circuit problems</a>, giving other commenters useful links on <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/find-the-flow-rate-water-pipe-down-a-hill.131786/#post-1082624">the Bernoulli Equation</a>, and asking for help from knowledgeable experts, <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/is-a-microprocessor-the-same-as-a-microcontroller.152622/">such as computer professional ravenprp</a>.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/PhysicsForums/Ravenprp Q&amp;A.png" alt="user Ravenprp asks himself for advice" title="user Ravenprp asks himself for advice"></p><p>So it seems that this was a real account, once, and that ravenprp was a real person with real posts, opinions, questions, and answers. But any original thoughts and writings he might have had in 74 original posts have been all but drowned out by the 2,817 extra posts which have been added, backdated, and attributed to him.</p><p>Still, while finding those posts might be a challenge, at least those threads themselves are intact. For instance, he was <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/how-does-truck-speed-affect-beat-frequency-in-doppler-shift.131785/#post-1083659">helped in one thread by kyle8921</a>:</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/PhysicsForums/kyle8921 and ravenprp.png" alt="user ravenprp asking for help with a homework question" title="user ravenprp asking for help with a homework question"></p><p>And the answer would seem pretty reasonable at first glance, were it not for two small problems:</p><ul><li>Kyle8921, oddly enough, decided to finish an incomplete LaTeX expression from ravenprp’s post before beginning his own answer.</li><li>Much like ravenprp, Kyle8921 posted the answer more than a year after he last logged in, <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/members/kyle8921.27110/">and continued posting for more than three years after that</a>.</li></ul><p><img data-src="/assets/img/PhysicsForums/kyle8921 0.png" alt="Kyle8921's last login date along with a post long after that date" title="Kyle8921's last login date along with a post long after that date"></p><p>Exactly how deep does this go?</p><h2 id="the-internet-is-forever">The Internet is Forever</h2><blockquote><p>In regards to the dead internet hypothesis, the content that you’re enjoying today, will still be there tomorrow.</p><p>LoveMortuus, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41055299">July 24th, 2024</a></p></blockquote><p>Founder Greg Bernhardt started PhysicsForums as a simple GHB bulletin board, and he gave each thread and post a unique numerical ID; unlike many modern sites, this ID was sequential, with the first post given the ID of 1, the second post 2, and so forth. Some of these posts, of course, have since been deleted for one reason or another (including the first two years’ worth of discussion, which is why post #1 is in 2003 and not 2001), so we would not expect the line of posts to be continuous and unbroken…but we <em>would</em> expect the line to be monotonically increasing, so long as no posts had been retroactively added to the database. Plotting a sample of 30,000 posts grabbed at random, we can see how that pattern holds up:</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/PhysicsForums/PhysicsForums Post Anomalies Zoomed Out.png" alt="A graph of anomalous post dates, fully zoomed out from 2003-2025" title="A graph of anomalous post dates, fully zoomed out from 2003-2025"></p><p>For almost the entire history of PhysicsForums, that rule held true: if post A had a larger ID than post B, then post A had a later timestamp than post B. And anywhere that rule does not hold true, we can reasonably infer that the database has been altered and that a more recent post has been given an older date retroactively.</p><p>Database alteration and retroactive dating are not necessarily bad things. The biggest example came in 2022, when PhysicsForums merged with MathHelpBoards and incorporated its ~150,000 post archive, with each post given its original date. There are smaller examples within PhysicsForums history of a thread getting split (due to some off-topic but nevertheless useful) discussion, or a post getting deleted but then restored with a newer ID, or a database hiccough causing re-assignment, or various other entirely justifiable small-scale edits. But on March 11th of 2023, a handful of posts were added all up and down the timeline, followed by a bigger group in May, an even bigger one in October, and the largest of all in January and February of 2024.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/PhysicsForums/PhysicsForums Post Anomalies Zoomed In.png" alt="A zoomed in version of the graph highlighting anomalous posts which have been backdated" title="A zoomed in version of the graph highlighting anomalous posts which have been backdated"></p><p>By taking the highly anomalous post IDs and filtering out the MathHelpBoards import, and filtering out instances which seem plausibly close to their actual post times, we get an estimated 115,000 posts written by LLMs and attributed to humans. Without scraping the entire website, it’s difficult to say precisely how many users have had their profiles revived, but taking a representative sample, there are at bare minimum 110 users affected. These range from <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/members/eljose79.79/">some of the earliest commenters</a>, to <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/members/kyle8921.27110">one-time posters</a> to <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/members/zefram.118/">long-time readers</a> to <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/members/greg-bernhardt.1/">founder and site administrator Greg Bernhardt</a>. In every case, a name is being attached to viewpoints that person does not necessarily endorse; certainly <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/infinite-intersection-of-indexed-sets.514569/">an average science enthusiast would not probably not endorse the notion that 0.999… does not equal 1</a>, if he knew about it:</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/PhysicsForums/BernhardtPointNineRepeating.png" alt="A post by Greg Bernhardt claiming .99999... != 1" title="A post by Greg Bernhardt claiming .99999... != 1" src="https://hallofdreams.org/assets/img/PhysicsForums/BernhardtPointNineRepeating.png"></p><p>But that’s the problem: they don’t know about it. We don’t know who most of these people are. We can’t get in touch with them. Many, if not most, have usernames either unique to PhysicsForums, or else so common elsewhere as to be useless for identification. They have moved on from PhysicsForums, living their lives, with no way of knowing what is or isn’t being said under their names, and no reason whatsoever to suspect anything is amiss. And maybe what’s said is accurate, or maybe it isn’t, but either way, with every additional post, the archives of the Internet are made just a little bit flatter, their own scientific contributions are diluted just a little bit more, and the portion of the Internet intentionally written by humans is shrunk just a little bit further.</p><h2 id="the-dead-internet-theory">The Dead Internet Theory</h2><blockquote><p>The internet feels empty and devoid of people…it’s like a hot air balloon with nothing inside.</p><p>Anonymage, <a href="https://i.4pcdn.org/x/1587947548944.png">“Dead Internet Theory (and much more)”</a>, September 16th, 2019</p></blockquote><p>The ‘Dead Internet Theory’ - the theory that much or most of the Internet consists of things not made by human beings - got its name in 2019, and has been slowly gaining popularity ever since. The theory as originally stated is a self-described ‘jumbled mess’, cites the ‘death’ of the Internet at about 2016 or 2017, and interestingly, predates almost every known LLM capable of writing convincing longform text; we tried a GPT-2 bot on /r/AskReddit two days after the original greentext, and the bot was noticed and called out within a handful of hours. And in 2016 or 2017, the state-of-the-art for text generation was Markov chains, and most bots online posted identical messages with no text generation at all.</p><p>The theory, and the general feeling that the Internet has changed shape, clearly had other root inspirations besides LLMs. Part of the feeling was probably due to the Internet opening up to a wider and wider global audience, with small community norms and standards simply not scaling up. Part of it was probably the device change from computer to smartphone encouraging a more passive role on the part of the audience. Part of it was probably algorithmic incentives towards more and more content engagement, as inevitable as <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Las Vegas’ extravagant casinos</a>, emerging from pure market forces and not attributable to any one person in particular.</p><p>But part of it <em>now</em>, six years later, is certainly LLMs.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/PhysicsForums/Anatomy of a PhysicsForums post.png" alt="A screenshot of a PhysicsForums post highlighting the vast amount of non-human generated content" title="A screenshot of a PhysicsForums post highlighting the vast amount of non-human generated content" width="400"></p><p>The thing is, it’s not like these non-human additions are adding value or usability in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250115221948/https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/spreadsheet-for-hp-50g-import-export-excel-calc.199904/">the original ravenprp thread we started with</a>. You could argue that adding a summary is helpful… but that’s only the case if the summary is correct, and as we know, the AI generated summaries have a real tendency to enrich the facts with things that may or may not be accurate.</p><p>We can accept the addition of some links, etc, as a potential enrichment; though their intrusive nature is disruptive like any other advertisement, sometimes we accept disruption as part of what is needed to keep a website operating. The rest of the thread, though, is a LLM-generated post that contains exactly one true fact (the existence of the “HP 50g Connectivity Kit”), and otherwise contains nothing that is actually reflected in the <a href="https://literature.hpcalc.org/official/hp50g-um-en.pdf">HP 50g manual</a>, or anywhere else one might find genuine information about the calculator.</p><p>Finally, we have the FAQ. This FAQ is the only place in the entire thread which references the “GET” and “PUT” functions of HP 50g Spreadsheet, and is the only place the summary could be getting them from. For that matter, the FAQ the only place in the entire <em>internet</em> which references those functions; the manual doesn’t talk about them, or talk about the “HP 50g Spreadsheet” at all…and searching for “HP 50g Spreadsheet”, as of the time of writing, returns this thread and nothing else.</p><p>So while ravenprp’s post has a hint of correctness, the FAQ pulls only from the title and is entirely wrong, and the summary pulls primarily from the FAQ and is also entirely wrong. But the fact that these answers are <em>incorrect</em> is not actually the only problem. Instead of reading the replies, we can do a quick tally of the amount of space each section of this thread takes up:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Section</th><th>Word Count</th><th>Human?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Summary</td><td>99</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Springo</td><td>38</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Phys.org</td><td>34</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Shinny_head</td><td>11</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Ravenprp</td><td>164</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>FAQ</td><td>260</td><td>No</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The LLM-written portions of this thread are 92% of the total word count. If this were a representative sample of the Internet, it would be reasonable to describe the Internet as ‘dead’.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/PhysicsForums/PhysicsForums Word Count Histogram.png" alt="A graph showing wordcounts by LLM vs humans on PhysicsForums" title="A graph showing wordcounts by LLM vs humans on PhysicsForums"></p><p>The situation across the entire PhysicsForums is not, fortunately, quite so dire yet. While the backdated LLM posts tend to be longer than average, they still make up only 1.6% of the total post count and 3% of the word count across all posts. The actual <em>deception</em> is still, even now, still a fairly small portion of the total. But, when counting in the LLM-generated FAQs and summaries - which, as we’ve seen, aren’t always accurate - the Dead Internet Theory seems to be vindicated, and only 66% of the words on the site were written by human beings. Two years ago, that number was close to 100%. Two years from now, then…who knows?</p><p>It is true that the old archives aren’t read all that frequently, so it could be argued that this is no great loss. Only three archived PhysicsForums post were shared on Twitter throughout all of 2024…and of those three, <a href="https://twitter.com/SheCelebratesND/status/1841278314033336661">one was a human sharing an bot-written post</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/BRAINCURES/status/1868329400133202057">another was a bot sharing a human-written post</a>. So really, does anyone care?</p><h2 id="man-vs-machine">Man vs Machine</h2><blockquote><p>“…using AI, one can generate tons of nonsense with very little work and overload us easily.” So far that hasn’t happened.</p><p>PeterDonis, <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/chatgpt-policy-pf-developing-policies-for-chatgpt.1048633/post-7131957">November 12th, 2024</a></p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>/* * Copyright (C) 2011-2012 DarkCore <a href="http://www.darkpeninsula.eu/">http://www.darkpeninsula.eu/</a> * Copyright (C) 2011-2012 Project SkyFire <a href="http://www.projectskyfire.org/">http://www.projectskyfire.org/</a> * Copyright (C) 2008-2012 TrinityCore <a href="http://www.trinitycore.org/">http://www.trinitycore.org/</a> * This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it * under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the * Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or (at your * option) any later version. * *</p><p>Nate810, <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/strong-inequality-hydrodynamics-flat-cylinder-in-water.1047623/#post-6886175">November 27th, 2022</a></p></blockquote><p>Certainly the community members of PhysicsForums care. In November of 2024, <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/why-are-these-pf-dates-inconsistent.1066951/">poster Renormalize noticed peculiar behavior by Azntoon</a>, and noticed specifically that Azntoon was posting in threads in 2022 despite having last logged on in 2012. The thread, however, soon came to the conclusion that it was some sort of database hiccough, and nothing more came of it. Interestingly, <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/members/azntoon.271917">Azntoon’s last login date</a> has since changed to December of 2022, making him one of the only two LLM-affected users to have (apparently) logged on again since the backdating began.</p><p>Users were on the lookout for it as early as 2022: the forum regulars <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/chatgpt-policy-pf-developing-policies-for-chatgpt.1048633/">debated what the policy regarding ChatGPT-generated responses should be</a>, with Vanadium 50 complaining that the “barely-lucid posts” generated by ChatGPT create a lot of work and could be considered a DoS attack. The general consensus in the thread was summarized by PhysicsForums administrator Greg Bernhardt:</p><blockquote><p>I’m pretty sure stackoverflow is attempting to ban it. I think we should discourage it, but I am unsure how to “ban” it here. Well worth a discussion. At a minimum content from ChatGPT should be quoted.</p></blockquote><p>A few months later, the site celebrated April Fools’ Day of 2023 <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/why-are-avatars-showing-as-chatgpt-instead-of-user-names-on-pf-posts.1051274/">by temporarily changing all display names to ChatGPT</a>, a few weeks after the LLM backdated insertion had already started, but since this was on April 1st, nobody assumed that posts were <em>actually</em> being written by ChatGPT. Alexander R. Klotz, <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/roger-babsons-anti-gravity-contest/">one-time contributor to PhysicsForums’ Insights blog</a>, noted on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexanderRKlotz/status/1680983219481772033">that his 2016 article had been edited without his knowledge</a>, but the edits seem to be limited to an LLM-generated summary awkwardly placed in the middle, and a manually-inserted author’s note from 2018. The actual scope of the change across and the addition of more than a hundred thousand posts is something we’ve seen no discussion of, anywhere, as of yet.</p><p>But the backdated <em>users</em> have all been hidden from the search’s autocomplete, and profile links have all been removed from their posts, presumably to make it more difficult to click the profile and notice that something is wrong.</p><p>Changes like this tend to be gradual: a slight drift over time, compromises made to keep the site afloat. When the community notices, it can all be explained, eased, and made bearable, even as everything changes inch by inch. If the community backlash is too great, it’s easy to backpedal and explain and have a lesser version of the change remain. Ultimately, the incentives towards making these changes will not go away. What decides how they work out is the judgement of the people making the changes and how the community responds to them.</p><h2 id="update-faqs">Update: FAQs</h2><p>During the writing of this post, the FAQs were actually noticed as well, and <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/low-quality-faq-sections-on-closed-threads-ai-generated.1068161/">a discussion thread</a> was created. It appears that they were not visible to logged-in users, explaining why the forum regulars did not notice: the average forum regular interested enough to go back and reread old posts will probably be logged in while doing so. The FAQs have now been removed, though the LLM-written summaries at the top of closed threads are still present.</p><h2 id="the-internet-is-people">The Internet is People</h2><blockquote><p>Could you provide a topic or theme<br> For the lyrics - for example, something like ‘A day at the beach’,<br> ‘A street party’, or ‘A journey through the city’?<br> This will help me provide a more focused and engaging song for you.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/2xyMHshBDB4">“Kito - Could You”, Kito’S Music Beats</a></p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The dead internet theory is coming to fruition.</p><p>Greg Bernhardt, <a href="https://twitter.com/GregBernhardt4/status/1875287174205374533">January 3rd, 2025</a></p></blockquote><p>We reached out to Greg Bernhardt asking for comment on LLM usage in PhysicsForums, and he replied:</p><blockquote><p>We have many AI tests in the works to add value to the community. I sent out a 2024 feedback form to members a few weeks ago and many members don’t want AI features. We’ll either work with members to dramatically improve them or end up removing them. We experimented with AI answers from test accounts last year but they were not meeting quality standards. If you find any test accounts we missed, please let me know. My documentation was not the best.</p></blockquote><p>And in response to a follow-up question about the community feedback, he replied:</p><blockquote><p>Mathwonk originally raised the issue of quality. I worked with him to improve them using a newer model, but it’s still not good enough.</p><p>The backdated answers were an internal test. We conceived of a bot that would provide a quality answer to a thread without a reply after 1+ years. That too also failed. Instead, I’m considering pruning all threads without a reply as they clutter up the forums.</p></blockquote><p>It’s hard to imagine that 110 existing users gave consent to be used as test accounts, for 115,000 posts, over four waves spanning almost a year. The idea that these are test accounts gone wrong, or a bot accidentally mislabeled, doesn’t seem to align with the facts.</p><p>It also ties directly to an unstated but very real expectation: my identity in an online community is <em>mine</em>. I have accounts on forums that are older than some friendships. I have written tens of thousands of words under various identities. Just because they are relatively anonymous doesn’t make them less real to me, it doesn’t diminish the effort and time I put into the work done under those identities. Hijacking accounts, filling it with content their original owners did not write? That dilutes their efforts, and muddles their identities. The content was produced with the idea that it was <em>mine</em> in some capacity, inextricably tied to an identity I owned.</p><p>There’s also a social contract: when we create an account in an online community, we do it with the expectation that people we are going to interact with are primarily people. Oh, there will be shills, and bots, and advertisers, but the agreement between the users and the community provider is that they are going to try to defend us from that, and that in exchange we will provide our engagement and content. This is why the recent experiments from Meta with AI generated users are both ridiculous and sickening. When you might be interacting with something masquerading as a human, providing at best, tepid garbage, the value of human interaction via the internet is lost.</p><p>Beyond that, the idea of populating existing accounts with LLM-generated content is destructive. Like paving over an arboretum to make room for a generic strip mall. Internet archaeology is already a difficult and fraught business. It’s so difficult to find lost content, servers that have gone down, websites that are just <em>gone</em>… and now, apparently a lot of backdated data that is AI generated. This is not to say websites shouldn’t evolve and stay current, but this is different, this is a re-writing of history, and rewrites history for no clear gain.</p><p>It probably feels odd to see us write thousands of words fighting for the integrity of a community neither of us is part of, a tiny speck on the Internet trying desperately to survive, an enclave of a different era that is trying to hold on at all costs. But we are sympathetic. Running a website, especially a forum, is expensive. Server costs go up. Databases stop working and now you need to pay an expert or spend hours of unpaid time working on it. Bots flood in. DDOS attacks happen. Another wave of crypto-scams shows up. Staying alive on the internet costs money, and money comes through users and ads. You need those clicks like a man in the desert needs water, and every week it gets more competitive.</p><p>One must transform to survive. That axiom is a truth on the internet. If you don’t, you rapidly find yourself buried on the eighth page of Google results, with no users and no money to keep the servers up. But when communities compromise their morals and the core of their identity to stay afloat, and destroy the very bedrock of their commitment to their users and to some degree to the broader idea of the Internet, we have to wonder… was it worth it?</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>One of the initial explorations that started this book was how small and simple a compile-to-WebAssembly language implemented in JavaScript could be. Our first “WebAssembly compiler in a tweet” was 269 bytes; since then, we’ve managed to whittle it down to a measly 192 bytes.</p>
<p>The final result is a compiler that takes an arithmetic expression — written in reverse polish notation — and compiles it down to a valid WebAssembly module. That module exports a single function which returns the result of the original arithmetic expression. Here it is:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>let c=(b,l)=&gt;WebAssembly.instantiate(new Int8Array(</span></p></div><div><p><span>[,97,115,109,1,,,,1,5,1,96,,1,127,3,2,1,,7,4,1,,,,10,</span></p></div><div><p><span>l=(b=b.split` `.flatMap(t=&gt;t&gt;-1?[65,t]:107+'-*/'.indexOf(t)))</span></p></div><div><p><span>.length+4,1,l-2,,...b,11]))</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>And here’s an example of how you can use it:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>(await c('11 11 1 - + 4 * 2 /')).instance.exports['']()</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>But this is not just a clever trick — if you take the time to understand what this code does, you’ll learn a surprising amount about WebAssembly! In the rest of the post, we’ll explain how it all works by de-obfuscating the code one step at a time.</p>
<p>You can play with the code in this post here: <a href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/rpn-to-wasm-js-compiler?file=index.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stackblitz.com/edit/rpn-to-wasm-js-compiler</a>.</p>
<h2>Format</h2>
<p>The first thing we can do to make it more readable is to format it:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>let c1 = (b, l) =&gt;</span></p></div><div><p><span>  WebAssembly.instantiate(</span></p></div><div><p><span>    new Int8Array([</span></p></div><div><p><span>      , 97, 115, 109, 1, , , , 1, 5, 1, 96, , 1, 127, 3, 2, 1, , 7, 4, 1, , , , 10,</span></p></div><div><p><span>      (l = (b = b.split` `.flatMap(</span></p></div><div><p><span>            (t) =&gt; t &gt; -1 ? [65, t] : 107 + "-*/".indexOf(t)</span></p></div><div><p><span>           )).length + 4),</span></p></div><div><p><span>      1, l - 2, , ...b, 11</span></p></div><div><p><span>    ])</span></p></div><div><p><span>  );</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>While it’s still pretty unreadable, now we can at least identify different parts of the code.</p>
<p>At a high level, what we’re doing is ‘parsing’ the expression in a very simple way, turning it into the appropriate Wasm bytecode,
and then hand-crafting the bytes for a single-function module.</p>
<p>In a more complex compiler you would probably use a library to generate the WebAssembly module and compile the expressions but our main metric
here is code size so we write the bytes directly in an array.</p>
<h2>Remove Assignment Expression</h2>
<p>The first trick to undo is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Assignment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assignment expression</a>.</p>
<p>In JavaScript the assignment operator is an expression. This means that it generates a result after evaluating, as you can see in the following examples:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>let a, b;</span></p></div><div><p><span>console.log('a', a = 42);</span></p></div><div><p><span>a = b = 43;</span></p></div><div><p><span>console.log('b', b);</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>The code above will output:</p>

<p>This is because <code>a = 42</code> assigns <code>42</code> to <code>a</code> and the whole assignment expression evaluates to the value being assigned.</p>
<p>In <code>a = b = 43</code>, we assign the result of evaluating <code>b = 43</code> to <code>a</code>. This equivalent expression may be easier to understand: <code>a = (b = 43)</code>.</p>
<p>In our code, we use this trick to reuse variables and update their value in places where
we can also use the value being assigned. It also allows us to have our compiler in a single expression, avoiding the need for curly braces, semicolons and return statements.</p>
<p>To undo it, we turn the body of our function into a block and do each assignment on its own line:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>let c2 = (b, l) =&gt; {</span></p></div><div><p><span>  b = b.split` `.flatMap(</span></p></div><div><p><span>    (t) =&gt; (t &gt; -1 ? [65, t] : 107 + "-*/".indexOf(t))</span></p></div><div><p><span>  );</span></p></div><div><p><span>  l = b.length + 4;</span></p></div><div><p><span>  return WebAssembly.instantiate(</span></p></div><div><p><span>    new Int8Array([</span></p></div><div><p><span>      , 97, 115, 109, 1, , , , 1, 5, 1, 96, , 1, 127, 3, 2, 1, , 7, 4, 1, , , ,</span></p></div><div><p><span>      10, l, 1, l - 2, , ...b, 11</span></p></div><div><p><span>    ]),</span></p></div><div><p><span>  );</span></p></div><div><p><span>};</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<h2>Undo Variable Tricks</h2>
<p>Now the assignments are easier to identify but the meaning of variables and function
arguments are still hard to understand. Let’s fix that by undoing a couple of variable tricks.</p>
<p>The first step is to stop using single letter variables, and to use more descriptive names instead. The next step is to stop reusing variables: for example, <code>b</code> initially holds the code to compile, but once we don’t need that any more we reuse it to hold the bytecode instructions.</p>
<p>To undo this we are going to introduce a new <code>instrs</code> variable and rename <code>b</code> to <code>code</code>. We’ll also rename <code>l</code> to <code>len</code>. This variable contains a value that is close to the number of bytecodes.</p>
<p>By declaring <code>l</code> in the body we can remove it from the function argument’s list. We did this
as a trick to avoid the need to declare it with <code>let</code> or <code>const</code>, saving some bytes and the need for a function body.</p>
<p>The trick works by adding unused arguments at the end of the function argument list and using them as local variables. Our compiler function expects a single argument with the code; <code>l</code> is there for us to use since we don’t expect the caller to provide any value for it.</p>
<p>Here’s the code without this trick:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>let c3 = (code) =&gt; {</span></p></div><div><p><span>  const instrs = code.split` `.flatMap(</span></p></div><div><p><span>    (t) =&gt; (t &gt; -1 ? [65, t] : 107 + "-*/".indexOf(t))</span></p></div><div><p><span>  );</span></p></div><div><p><span>  const len = instrs.length + 4;</span></p></div><div><p><span>  return WebAssembly.instantiate(</span></p></div><div><p><span>    new Int8Array([</span></p></div><div><p><span>      , 97, 115, 109, 1, , , , 1, 5, 1, 96, , 1, 127, 3, 2, 1, , 7, 4, 1, , , ,</span></p></div><div><p><span>      10, len, 1, len - 2, , ...instrs, 11</span></p></div><div><p><span>    ]),</span></p></div><div><p><span>  );</span></p></div><div><p><span>};</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<h2>Add Missing Zeros</h2>
<p>If you look at the array in our code, you may notice that there are many commas followed by another comma instead of a value. This syntax defines “sparse arrays”. Here’s an example:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>const a1 = [,,];</span></p></div><div><p><span>console.log(a1.length); // Output: 2</span></p></div><div><p><span>console.log(a1); // Output: [ &lt;2 empty items&gt; ]</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Which is equivalent to:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>const a2 = new Array(2);</span></p></div><div><p><span>console.log(a2.length); // Output: 2</span></p></div><div><p><span>console.log(a2); // Output: [ &lt;2 empty items&gt; ]</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>We use this syntactic trick to save one byte each time we need a <code>0</code> to appear in the array. This works because <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Typed_arrays" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Typed Arrays</a> coerce all array items to numbers, and an “empty item” will be converted to 0:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>new Int8Array([0, null, undefined,,0])</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>which produces:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>Int8Array(5) [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Let’s undo this trick by adding all the zeroes back:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>let c4 = (code) =&gt; {</span></p></div><div><p><span>  const instrs = code.split` `.flatMap(</span></p></div><div><p><span>    (t) =&gt; (t &gt; -1 ? [65, t] : 107 + "-*/".indexOf(t))</span></p></div><div><p><span>  );</span></p></div><div><p><span>  const len = instrs.length + 4;</span></p></div><div><p><span>  return WebAssembly.instantiate(</span></p></div><div><p><span>    new Int8Array([</span></p></div><div><p><span>      0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 96, 0, 1, 127, 3, 2, 1, 0, 7, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0,</span></p></div><div><p><span>      10, len, 1, len - 2, 0, ...instrs, 11</span></p></div><div><p><span>    ]),</span></p></div><div><p><span>  );</span></p></div><div><p><span>};</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<h2>Remove Extra 4 bytes on Length Definition</h2>
<p>In our code, we have a variable <code>len</code> that contains a number that is close to the number
of bytecodes in the compiled expression, but not exactly the same:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>  const len = instrs.length + 4;</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>In the WebAssembly module we need to use the number of bytes in the function body (the expression to evaluate) in two places:</p>
<ul>
<li>To define the code section’s length</li>
<li>To define the function body’s length</li>
</ul>
<p>Since there’s only one function in the code section both values are similar:</p>
<ul>
<li>The section takes two extra bytes (section identifier and number of code entries)</li>
<li>The function body takes another two bytes (number of locals and <code>end</code> instruction)</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid writing <code>b.length</code> twice we assign to <code>l</code> the value of <code>b.length + 4</code> in the place where we need the code section byte count
and then calculate <code>l - 2</code> (<code>b.length + 2</code>) where we need the function body byte count.</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>[</span></p></div><div><p><span>  ...</span></p></div><div><p><span>  l=(b=b.split` `.flatMap(t=&gt;t&gt;-1?[65,t]:107+'-*/'.indexOf(t))).length+4,1,l-2</span></p></div><div><p><span>  ...</span></p></div><div><p><span>]</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>This is all a trick to avoid having to write <code>b.length</code> twice.</p>
<p>let’s assign the length to <code>len</code> and calculate the right value in each place:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>let c5 = (code) =&gt; {</span></p></div><div><p><span>  const instrs = code.split` `.flatMap(</span></p></div><div><p><span>    (t) =&gt; (t &gt; -1 ? [65, t] : 107 + "-*/".indexOf(t))</span></p></div><div><p><span>  );</span></p></div><div><p><span>  const len = instrs.length;</span></p></div><div><p><span>  return WebAssembly.instantiate(</span></p></div><div><p><span>    new Int8Array([</span></p></div><div><p><span>      0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 96, 0, 1, 127, 3, 2, 1, 0, 7, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0,</span></p></div><div><p><span>      10, 4 + len, 1, 2 + len, 0, ...instrs, 11</span></p></div><div><p><span>    ]),</span></p></div><div><p><span>  );</span></p></div><div><p><span>};</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<h2>Remove String Template Literal Instead of Function Call</h2>
<p>The next trick to undo is <code>code.split` `</code>. In this case, we use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tagged Template</a> feature of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">String Template Literals</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s see how it works by creating a simple tagged template that turns the string to uppercase:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>function upper(s) {</span></p></div><div><p><span>  return s[0].toUpperCase();</span></p></div><div><p><span>}</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>And use it:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>upper`Hello, World!`</span></p></div><div><p><span>&gt; "HELLO, WORLD!"</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>As you can see, the first argument to the tagged template function is an array. Luckily for us, the first argument of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split#separator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">String.prototype.split</a> is handled in the following way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All values that are not undefined or objects with a <code>[Symbol.split]()</code> method are coerced to strings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And coercing an array with one string in it is the same as the string itself:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>["hello"].toString()</span></p></div><div><p><span>&gt; "hello"</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>

<p>Since the function we want to call takes a single string argument, we can use it as a tagged template and save the parentheses in the function call.</p>
<p>Let’s write it as a function call instead:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>let c6 = (code) =&gt; {</span></p></div><div><p><span>  const instrs = code.split(' ').flatMap(</span></p></div><div><p><span>    (t) =&gt; (t &gt; -1 ? [65, t] : 107 + "-*/".indexOf(t))</span></p></div><div><p><span>  );</span></p></div><div><p><span>  const len = instrs.length;</span></p></div><div><p><span>  return WebAssembly.instantiate(</span></p></div><div><p><span>    new Int8Array([</span></p></div><div><p><span>      0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 96, 0, 1, 127, 3, 2, 1, 0, 7, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0,</span></p></div><div><p><span>      10, 4 + len, 1, 2 + len, 0, ...instrs, 11</span></p></div><div><p><span>    ]),</span></p></div><div><p><span>  );</span></p></div><div><p><span>};</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<h2>Remove the Ternary Operator</h2>
<p>Next, let’s undo the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_operator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ternary Operator</a> and turn it into an <em>if</em> statement.</p>
<p>The ternary operator has expressions on each branch saving us the <code>return</code> statements. Here’s what the code looks like when we use an <em>if</em> statement instead:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>let c7 = (code) =&gt; {</span></p></div><div><p><span>  const instrs = code.split(" ").flatMap((t) =&gt; {</span></p></div><div><p><span>    if (t &gt; -1) {</span></p></div><div><p><span>      return [65, t];</span></p></div><div><p><span>    } else {</span></p></div><div><p><span>      return 107 + "-*/".indexOf(t);</span></p></div><div><p><span>    }</span></p></div><div><p><span>  });</span></p></div><div><p><span>  const len = instrs.length;</span></p></div><div><p><span>  return WebAssembly.instantiate(</span></p></div><div><p><span>    new Int8Array([</span></p></div><div><p><span>      0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 96, 0, 1, 127, 3, 2, 1, 0, 7, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0,</span></p></div><div><p><span>      10, 4 + len, 1, 2 + len, 0, ...instrs, 11</span></p></div><div><p><span>    ]),</span></p></div><div><p><span>  );</span></p></div><div><p><span>};</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<h2>Remove Number Check With Coercion</h2>
<p>The next trick to undo is the one present twice in the following code:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>    if (t &gt; -1) {</span></p></div><div><p><span>      return [65, t];</span></p></div><div><p><span>    }</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>First we use coercion in <code>t &gt; -1</code> to check if the token <code>t</code> is a string representing a
positive number. Then we use coercion again in <code>[65, t]</code> to let JavaScript turn <code>t</code> into a <code>Number</code> in the <code>Int8Array</code>:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>new Int8Array([65, '42'])</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>The code above evaluates to:</p>

<p>Let’s write the parsing and checking explicitly:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>let c8 = (code) =&gt; {</span></p></div><div><p><span>  const instrs = code.split(" ").flatMap((t) =&gt; {</span></p></div><div><p><span>    const num = parseInt(t, 10);</span></p></div><div><p><span>    if (Number.isFinite(num)) {</span></p></div><div><p><span>      return [65, num];</span></p></div><div><p><span>    } else {</span></p></div><div><p><span>      return 107 + "-*/".indexOf(t);</span></p></div><div><p><span>    }</span></p></div><div><p><span>  });</span></p></div><div><p><span>  const len = instrs.length;</span></p></div><div><p><span>  return WebAssembly.instantiate(</span></p></div><div><p><span>    new Int8Array([</span></p></div><div><p><span>      0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 96, 0, 1, 127, 3, 2, 1, 0, 7, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0,</span></p></div><div><p><span>      10, 4 + len, 1, 2 + len, 0, ...instrs, 11</span></p></div><div><p><span>    ]),</span></p></div><div><p><span>  );</span></p></div><div><p><span>};</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>The semantics of our compiler change a little bit here. The original version will only accept
positive integers as input; if you want a negative number you have to subtract from zero: <code>0 - 1</code> to get <code>-1</code>. The new version allows negative numbers since it checks with <code>Number.isFinite(num)</code> instead of <code>t &gt; -1</code>.</p>
<h2>Remove indexOf -1 Trick</h2>
<p>The next trick is in the <em>else</em> branch:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>      return 107 + "-*/".indexOf(t);</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Our calculator compiler only accepts four arithmetic operations: <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>/</code>. But
in the code above you can only see three: <code>-*/</code> and a magical number: <code>107</code>. Here’s how it works — these are the bytecode numbers for arithmetic operations in WebAssembly:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>+</code>: <code>106</code></li>
<li><code>-</code>: <code>107</code></li>
<li><code>*</code>: <code>108</code></li>
<li><code>/</code>: <code>109</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We only enter this branch if the token <code>t</code> is not a number, which means it can only be
one of the arithmetic operators above. So, given a single character which is one of those four operators, we want to produce the appropriate opcode.</p>
<p>We <em>could</em> have written <code>106 + "+-*/".indexOf(t)</code>. That is, we find the symbol’s index in the string:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>+</code>: <code>0</code></li>
<li><code>-</code>: <code>1</code></li>
<li><code>*</code>: <code>2</code></li>
<li><code>/</code>: <code>3</code></li>
</ul>
<p>…and add <code>106</code> to it to get the bytecode number. But when <code>t</code> is not in the string, <code>"+-*/"</code> <code>indexOf</code> returns <code>-1</code>. We can use that to our advantage, and treat <code>-1</code> to mean “plus or any other token”:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>+</code>: <code>-1</code> (any other token will be <code>-1</code> too)</li>
<li><code>-</code>: <code>0</code></li>
<li><code>*</code>: <code>1</code></li>
<li><code>/</code>: <code>2</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s why we add <code>107</code> instead of <code>106</code>. Let’s undo the <code>-1</code> trick:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>let c9 = (code) =&gt; {</span></p></div><div><p><span>  const instrs = code.split(" ").flatMap((t) =&gt; {</span></p></div><div><p><span>    const num = parseInt(t, 10);</span></p></div><div><p><span>    if (Number.isFinite(num)) {</span></p></div><div><p><span>      return [65, num];</span></p></div><div><p><span>    } else {</span></p></div><div><p><span>      return 106 + "+-*/".indexOf(t);</span></p></div><div><p><span>    }</span></p></div><div><p><span>  });</span></p></div><div><p><span>  const len = instrs.length;</span></p></div><div><p><span>  return WebAssembly.instantiate(</span></p></div><div><p><span>    new Int8Array([</span></p></div><div><p><span>      0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 96, 0, 1, 127, 3, 2, 1, 0, 7, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0,</span></p></div><div><p><span>      10, 4 + len, 1, 2 + len, 0, ...instrs, 11</span></p></div><div><p><span>    ]),</span></p></div><div><p><span>  );</span></p></div><div><p><span>};</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Here again the semantics change a little bit. Before, if the token <code>t</code> wasn’t found, the expression would evaluate to <code>107 + -1</code> which would map to an addition. Now it will evaluate to <code>106 + -1</code> which will map to bytecode <code>105</code> which is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/Numeric/Population_count" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>popcnt</code></a> instruction.</p>
<p>But don’t worry, we’ll fix it in the next step.</p>
<h2>Remove indexOf Trick</h2>
<p>After explaining how the <code>indexOf</code> trick works and removing the <code>-1</code> part, let’s
go ahead and remove the trick completely. To do it we are going to create an object that maps from an arithmetic operation token to its bytecode:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>const OP_TO_BYTECODE = {</span></p></div><div><p><span>  "+": 106,</span></p></div><div><p><span>  "-": 107,</span></p></div><div><p><span>  "*": 108,</span></p></div><div><p><span>  "/": 109,</span></p></div><div><p><span>};</span></p></div><div><p><span>let c10 = (code) =&gt; {</span></p></div><div><p><span>  const instrs = code.split(" ").flatMap((t) =&gt; {</span></p></div><div><p><span>    const num = parseInt(t, 10);</span></p></div><div><p><span>    if (Number.isFinite(num)) {</span></p></div><div><p><span>      return [65, num];</span></p></div><div><p><span>    } else {</span></p></div><div><p><span>      return OP_TO_BYTECODE[t] ?? 106;</span></p></div><div><p><span>    }</span></p></div><div><p><span>  });</span></p></div><div><p><span>  const len = instrs.length;</span></p></div><div><p><span>  return WebAssembly.instantiate(</span></p></div><div><p><span>    new Int8Array([</span></p></div><div><p><span>      0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 96, 0, 1, 127, 3, 2, 1, 0, 7, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0,</span></p></div><div><p><span>      10, 4 + len, 1, 2 + len, 0, ...instrs, 11</span></p></div><div><p><span>    ]),</span></p></div><div><p><span>  );</span></p></div><div><p><span>};</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>To keep the initial semantics, if the token is not a valid operation we return the bytecode for <code>+</code>: in <code>OP_TO_BYTECODE[t] ?? 106</code>.</p>
<h2>Remove the Empty Export Name</h2>
<p>From the usage example at the beginning of the post, you may have noticed that the exported
function’s name is the empty string:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>(await c('11 11 1 - + 4 * 2 /')).instance.exports['']()</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>We did this to save us the bytes needed to specify the export name,
but also to save an extra byte/character in the code because with the length of the export name being <code>0</code>
we can use the sparse array syntax to leave an empty spot in the WebAssembly module array.</p>
<p>To revert this trick we are going to name the exported function as <code>a</code>, which in UTF-8 is the byte <code>97</code>:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>&gt; new TextEncoder().encode('a')[0]</span></p></div><div><p><span>97</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>const OP_TO_BYTECODE = {</span></p></div><div><p><span>  "+": 106,</span></p></div><div><p><span>  "-": 107,</span></p></div><div><p><span>  "*": 108,</span></p></div><div><p><span>  "/": 109,</span></p></div><div><p><span>};</span></p></div><div><p><span>let c11 = (code) =&gt; {</span></p></div><div><p><span>  const instrs = code.split(" ").flatMap((t) =&gt; {</span></p></div><div><p><span>    const num = parseInt(t, 10);</span></p></div><div><p><span>    if (Number.isFinite(num)) {</span></p></div><div><p><span>      return [65, num];</span></p></div><div><p><span>    } else {</span></p></div><div><p><span>      return OP_TO_BYTECODE[t] ?? 106;</span></p></div><div><p><span>    }</span></p></div><div><p><span>  });</span></p></div><div><p><span>  const len = instrs.length;</span></p></div><div><p><span>  return WebAssembly.instantiate(</span></p></div><div><p><span>    new Int8Array([</span></p></div><div><p><span>      0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 96, 0, 1, 127, 3, 2, 1, 0, 7, 5, 1, 1, 97, 0, 0,</span></p></div><div><p><span>      10, 4 + len, 1, 2 + len, 0, ...instrs, 11</span></p></div><div><p><span>    ]),</span></p></div><div><p><span>  );</span></p></div><div><p><span>};</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>We can now call it with a nicer name:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>(await c11('11 11 1 - + 4 * 2 /')).instance.exports.a()</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<h2>Implicit Design Decisions</h2>
<p>Our initial implementation only supported positive numbers, but that’s not the only number restriction in our compiler.</p>
<p>To keep WebAssembly modules as small as possible, numbers are encoded using a variable-length encoding algorithm called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LEB128</a>. You can tell we are not implementing the whole algorithm by looking at the part of the code that encodes numbers: <code>[65,t]</code>. We’re assuming the number being encoded fits in 7 bits, the shortest possible LEB128 representation.</p>
<p>Let’s try the limits of our implementation:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>(await c('63')).instance.exports['']();</span></p></div><div><p><span>&gt; 63</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>(await c('64')).instance.exports['']();</span></p></div><div><p><span>&gt; -64</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>This means the only numbers that will be parsed correctly are from <code>0</code> to <code>63</code>.</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>(await c('127')).instance.exports['']();</span></p></div><div><p><span>&gt; -1</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>(await c('128')).instance.exports['']();</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<p>Fails with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uncaught CompileError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): Compiling function #0 failed: function body must end with “end” opcode @+33</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the last one we went over the 7 bits and the module was rejected during validation.</p>
<p>Explaining and implementing LEB128 takes a lot of text and code. If you want to read more
about it we have a whole deep dive on LEB128 in <a href="https://wasmgroundup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our book</a>.</p>
<h2>A Trick that Almost Worked</h2>
<p>During the code golfing phase I had a literal shower thought but sadly it didn’t work.</p>
<p>The idea was to simplify <code>106 + "+-*/".indexOf(t)</code> by using the UTF-8 character code plus an offset like this: <code>63 + t.charCodeAt()</code> and saving 3 bytes in the process. The reason it didn’t work is that the characters <code>+-*/</code> don’t appear in the same order in UTF-8 and WebAssembly bytecode.</p>
<h2>Explaining the Numbers in the Array</h2>
<p>The last part to expand/explain is the array of numbers used to build the WebAssembly module.</p>
<p>It takes a big part of a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/REC-wasm-core-1-20191205/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specification</a> to explain every byte in the array, but here’s a commented version that should give you a high level idea of what each part does:</p>
<div data-ch-theme="nord"><p><code><br><div><p><span>    [</span></p></div><div><p><span>      // Wasm module magic number '\0asm'</span></p></div><div><p><span>      [0, 97, 115, 109],</span></p></div><div><p><span>      // Wasm version 1.0</span></p></div><div><p><span>      [1, 0, 0, 0],</span></p></div><div><p><span>      // ----- type section -----</span></p></div><div><p><span>      1, // Section identifier</span></p></div><div><p><span>      5, // Section size in bytes</span></p></div><div><p><span>      1, // Number of entries that follow</span></p></div><div><p><span>      // type section - entry 0</span></p></div><div><p><span>      96, // Type `function`</span></p></div><div><p><span>      0,  // Number of parameters</span></p></div><div><p><span>      1,  // Number of return values</span></p></div><div><p><span>      127, // return type i32</span></p></div><div><p><span>      // ----- function section -----</span></p></div><div><p><span>      3, // Section identifier</span></p></div><div><p><span>      2, // Section size in bytes</span></p></div><div><p><span>      1, // Number of entries that follow</span></p></div><div><p><span>      // function section - entry 0</span></p></div><div><p><span>      0, // Index of the type section entry</span></p></div><div><p><span>      // ----- export section -----</span></p></div><div><p><span>      7, // Section identifier</span></p></div><div><p><span>      5, // Section size in bytes</span></p></div><div><p><span>      1, // Number of entries that follow</span></p></div><div><p><span>      // export section - entry 0</span></p></div><div><p><span>      1,  // Name size in bytes</span></p></div><div><p><span>      97, // String as utf-8 bytes for 'a'</span></p></div><div><p><span>      0,  // Export type `function`</span></p></div><div><p><span>      0,  // Function Index</span></p></div><div><p><span>      // ----- code section -----</span></p></div><div><p><span>      10, // Section identifier</span></p></div><div><p><span>      4 + len, // Section size in bytes</span></p></div><div><p><span>      1, // Number of entries that follow</span></p></div><div><p><span>      // code section - entry 0</span></p></div><div><p><span>      2 + len, // Entry size in bytes</span></p></div><div><p><span>      0, // Number of local variables</span></p></div><div><p><span>      ...instrs,</span></p></div><div><p><span>      11, // `end` instruction</span></p></div><div><p><span>    ]</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There you go! We’ve turned a rather opaque 192-byte snippet into something that’s almost readable. And in the process, you hopefully learned a little bit about WebAssembly.</p>
<p>If we dropped the size restrictions, there are lots of things we might want to improve in this compiler: handle numbers greater than 127, add nicer syntax, add support for conditionals, loops, etc. If you’re interested in what that might look like, I encourage you to check out our book <a href="https://wasmgroundup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAssembly from the Ground Up</a>. You’ll learn the ins and outs of WebAssembly by writing a real compiler for a simple programming language. It’s a lot of fun!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="snowdrop-contentpanel">

<h2>Introduction section</h2>
<p>

Welcome to the pages of Snowdrop OS, my homebrew operating system project.
</p><p><img alt="" src="http://sebastianmihai.com/snowdrop/images/snowdrop-intro.jpg"></p>

<p>Snowdrop OS was born of my childhood curiosity around what happens when a PC is turned on, the mysteries of bootable disks, and the hidden aspects of operating systems. It is a 16-bit real mode operating system for the IBM PC architecture. I designed and developed this homebrew OS from scratch, using only x86 assembly language. 
</p><p>
I have created and included a number of utilities, including a file manager, text editor, graphical applications, BASIC interpreter, x86 assembler and debugger. I also ported one of my DOS games to it. After all, what kind of an operating system doesn't have games?
</p><p>
The Snowdrop OS and the apps are distributed as both a floppy disk (1.44Mb) image, as well as a CD-ROM image. The images contain the following, all programmed from scratch:
</p><ul><li>a boot loader which loads the kernel into memory</li><li>a kernel which sets up interrupt vectors to be used by user apps, and then loads the startup app</li><li>user apps, including a shell (command line interface), utilities, test apps, and aSMtris, my Tetris clone</li></ul><p>
Snowdrop OS can also be installed to a hard disk - prompting the user to do so during boot - if it detects one. 
</p><p>
I hope that Snowdrop can serve other programmers who are looking to get a basic understanding of operating system functions. Like my other projects, the source code is fully available, without any restrictions on its usage and modification.
</p><h2>Source code browser</h2>
<p>

<p dir="auto">Wild is a linker with the goal of being very fast for iterative development.</p>
<p dir="auto">The plan is to eventually make it incremental, however that isn't yet implemented. It is however
already pretty fast even without incremental linking.</p>

<p dir="auto">During development, if you'd like faster warm build times, then you could give Wild a try. It's at
the point now where it should be usable for development purposes provided you're developing on

<p dir="auto">Mold is already very fast, however it doesn't do incremental linking and the author has stated that
they don't intend to. Wild doesn't do incremental linking yet, but that is the end-goal. By writing
Wild in Rust, it's hoped that the complexity of incremental linking will be achievable.</p>

<p dir="auto">It's somewhat of a tradition for linkers to end with the letters "ld". e.g. "GNU ld, "gold", "lld",
"mold". Since the end-goal is for the linker to be incremental, an "I" is added. Let's say the "W"
stands for "Wild", since recursive acronyms are popular in open-source projects.</p>

<p dir="auto">The goal of Wild is to eventually be very fast via incremental linking. However, we also want to be
as fast as we can be for non-incremental linking and for the initial link when incremental linking
is enabled.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Computer scientists often deal with abstract problems that are hard to comprehend, but an exciting new algorithm matters to anyone who owns books and at least one shelf. The algorithm addresses something called the library sorting problem (more formally, the “list labeling” problem). The challenge is to devise a strategy for organizing books in some kind of sorted order — alphabetically, for instance — that minimizes how long it takes to place a new book on the shelf.</p>
<p>Imagine, for example, that you keep your books clumped together, leaving empty space on the far right of the shelf. Then, if you add a book by Isabel Allende to your collection, you might have to move every book on the shelf to make room for it. That would be a time-consuming operation. And if you then get a book by Douglas Adams, you’ll have to do it all over again. A better arrangement would leave unoccupied spaces distributed throughout the shelf — but how, exactly, should they be distributed?</p>
<p>This problem was introduced in a <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-10843-2_34">1981 paper</a>, and it goes beyond simply providing librarians with organizational guidance. That’s because the problem also applies to the arrangement of files on hard drives and in databases, where the items to be arranged could number in the billions. An inefficient system means significant wait times and major computational expense. Researchers have invented some efficient methods for storing items, but they’ve long wanted to determine the best possible way.</p>
<p>Last year, in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00807">a study</a> that was presented at the Foundations of Computer Science conference in Chicago, a team of seven researchers described a way to organize items that comes tantalizingly close to the theoretical ideal. The new approach combines a little knowledge of the bookshelf’s past contents with the surprising power of randomness.</p>
<p>“It’s a very important problem,” said <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~pettie/">Seth Pettie</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Michigan, because many of the data structures we rely upon today store information sequentially. He called the new work “extremely inspired [and] easily one of my top three favorite papers of the year.”</p>
<h2><strong>Narrowing Bounds</strong></h2>
<p>So how does one measure a well-sorted bookshelf? A common way is to see how long it takes to insert an individual item. Naturally, that depends on how many items there are in the first place, a value typically denoted by <em>n</em>. In the Isabel Allende example, when all the books have to move to accommodate a new one, the time it takes is proportional to <em>n</em>. The bigger the <em>n</em>, the longer it takes. That makes this an “upper bound” to the problem: It will never take longer than a time proportional to <em>n</em> to add one book to the shelf.</p>

<p>The authors of the 1981 paper that ushered in this problem wanted to know if it was possible to design an algorithm with an average insertion time much less than<em> n</em>. And indeed, they proved that one could do better. They created an algorithm that was guaranteed to achieve an average insertion time proportional to (log <em>n</em>)<sup>2</sup>. This algorithm had two properties: It was “deterministic,” meaning that its decisions did not depend on any randomness, and it was also “smooth,” meaning that the books must be spread evenly within subsections of the shelf where insertions (or deletions) are made. The authors left open the question of whether the upper bound could be improved even further. For over four decades, no one managed to do so.</p>
<p>However, the intervening years did see improvements to the lower bound. While the upper bound specifies the maximum possible time needed to insert a book, the lower bound gives the fastest possible insertion time. To find a definitive solution to a problem, researchers strive to narrow the gap between the upper and lower bounds, ideally until they coincide. When that happens, the algorithm is deemed optimal — inexorably bounded from above and below, leaving no room for further refinement.</p>
<p>In 2004, a team of researchers found that the <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S0895480100315808?journalCode=sjdmec">best any algorithm could do</a> for the library sorting problem — in other words, the ultimate lower bound — was log <em>n</em>. This result pertained to the most general version of the problem, applying to any algorithm of any type. Two of the same authors had already secured a result for a more specific version of the problem in 1990, showing that for any smooth algorithm, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-52846-6_87">the lower bound is significantly higher</a>: (log <em>n</em>)<sup>2</sup>. And in 2012, another team <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2213977.2214083">proved the same lower bound</a>, (log <em>n</em>)<sup>2</sup>, for any deterministic algorithm that does not use randomness at all.</p>
<p>These results showed that for any smooth or deterministic algorithm, you could not achieve an average insertion time better than (log <em>n</em>)<sup>2</sup>, which was the same as the upper bound established in the 1981 paper. In other words, to improve that upper bound, researchers would need to devise a different kind of algorithm. “If you’re going to do better, you have to be randomized and non-smooth,” said <a href="https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/michaelbender">Michael Bender</a>, a computer scientist at Stony Brook University.</p>

<p>But getting rid of smoothness, which requires items to be spread apart more or less evenly, seemed like a mistake. (Remember the problems that arose from our initial example — the non-smooth configuration where all the books were clumped together on the left-hand side of the shelf.) And it also was not obvious how leaving things to random chance — essentially a coin toss — would help matters. “Intuitively, it wasn’t clear that was a direction that made sense,” Bender said.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in 2022, Bender and five colleagues decided to try out a randomized, non-smooth algorithm anyway, just to see whether it might offer any advantages.</p>
<h2><strong>A Secret History</strong></h2>
<p>Ironically, progress came from another restriction. There are sound privacy or security reasons why you may want to use an algorithm that’s blind to the history of the bookshelf. “If I had <em>50 Shades of Grey </em>on my bookshelf and took it off,” said <a href="https://csd.cmu.edu/people/faculty/william-kuszmaul">William Kuszmaul</a> of Carnegie Mellon University, nobody would be able to tell.</p>

<p>In a 2022 paper, Bender, Kuszmaul and four co-authors created just such an algorithm — one that was “history independent,” non-smooth and randomized — which finally <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02763">reduced the 1981 upper bound</a>, bringing the average insertion time down to (log <em>n</em>)<sup>1.5</sup>.</p>
<p>Kuszmaul remembers being surprised that a tool normally used to ensure privacy could confer other benefits. “It’s as if you used cryptography to make your algorithm faster,” he said. “Which just seems kind of strange.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/helen-xu">Helen Xu</a> of the Georgia Institute of Technology, who was not part of this research team, was also impressed.&nbsp; She said that the idea of using history independence for reasons other than security may have implications for many other types of problems.</p>
<h2><strong>Closing the Gap</strong></h2>
<p>Bender, Kuszmaul and others made an even bigger improvement with last year’s paper. They again broke the record, lowering the upper bound to (log <em>n</em>) times (log log <em>n</em>)<sup>3</sup> — equivalent to (log <em>n</em>)<sup>1.000…1</sup>. In other words, they came exceedingly close to the theoretical limit, the ultimate lower bound of log <em>n</em>.</p>
<p>Once again, their approach was non-smooth and randomized, but this time their algorithm relied on a limited degree of history dependence. It looked at past trends to plan for future events, but only up to a point. Suppose, for instance, you’ve been getting a lot of books by authors whose last name starts with N — Nabokov, Neruda, Ng. The algorithm extrapolates from that and assumes more are probably coming, so it’ll leave a little extra space in the N section. But reserving too much space could lead to trouble if a bunch of A-name authors start pouring in. “The way we made it a good thing was by being strategically random about how much history to look at when we make our decisions,” Bender said.</p>
<p>The result built on and transformed their previous work. It “uses randomness in a completely different way than the 2022 paper,” Pettie said.</p>
        
        
<p>These papers collectively represent “a significant improvement” on the theory side, said <a href="https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/people/brian-wheatman/">Brian Wheatman</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Chicago. “And on the applied side, I think they have the potential for a big improvement as well.”</p>
<p>Xu agrees. “In the past few years, there’s been interest in using data structures based on list labeling for storing and processing dynamic graphs,” she said. These advances would almost certainly make things faster.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there’s more for theorists to contemplate. “We know that we can almost do log <em>n</em>,” Bender said, “[but] there’s still this tiny gap” — the diminutive log log <em>n </em>term that stands in the way of a complete solution. “We don’t know if the right thing to do is to lower the upper bound or raise the lower bound.”</p>
<p>Pettie, for one, doesn’t expect the lower bound to change. “Usually in these situations, when you see a gap this close, and one of the bounds looks quite natural and the other looks unnatural, then the natural one is the right answer,” he said. It’s much more likely that any future improvements will affect the upper bound, bringing it all the way down to log <em>n.</em> “But the world’s full of weird surprises.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>I’ve been using Home Assistant for about seven years now, starting back when I was living in a small apartment. At the time, my setup was modest: I used the <strong>IKEA Smart Hub</strong> (when it first launched) to tie together all my apartment’s lights. As I got more comfortable with automations, I also began building <a href="https://vpetersson.com/2019/11/16/home-assistant-and-esphome.html">custom hardware like temperature and humidity sensors</a>.</p>

<p>However, once I started adding more complexity (more devices, more automations), I realized that running Home Assistant on a Raspberry Pi just wasn’t viable anymore. This was before Home Assistant offered their own hardware (which I haven’t tried, so I can’t say much about it). But for me, the main issue was the database. By default, Home Assistant uses SQLite, and when you have a ton of sensor data flowing in, SQLite can start choking.</p>

<p>My solution was to move everything to a VM on my home server. I also migrated Home Assistant’s main database to MySQL, and for longer-term metrics and historical data, I set up an InfluxDB server. (I’ve documented the details of my <a href="https://vpetersson.com/2024/05/04/home-server-journey.html">home server build in another blog post</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="scaling-up-in-a-new-house">Scaling Up in a New House</h2>

<p>When I moved into a house, my Home Assistant installation grew significantly: more rooms, more lights, and more devices overall. Right now, I have over 100 devices connected to Home Assistant, including a large number of smart lights (all IKEA), plus an assortment of other smart devices. Practically every bulb in my home is now integrated into Home Assistant.</p>

<h3 id="adaptive-lighting-moving-beyond-flux">Adaptive Lighting: Moving Beyond Flux</h3>

<p>One of the crucial features for me is <strong>Adaptive Lighting</strong>. Initially, I used <a href="https://vpetersson.com/2020/05/25/homeassistant-ikea-tradfri-flux-sensors.html">Flux</a> (an older solution for synchronizing lights with the time of day), but I’ve recently migrated to the new Adaptive Lighting integration available through HACS (Home Assistant Community Store). This newer system is much more sophisticated and has better capabilities for adjusting color temperature and brightness throughout the day.</p>

<p>Managing this setup comes with two main challenges. First, neither Flux nor Adaptive Lighting can target light groups. Instead, you need to explicitly list every single light entity in your configuration. This becomes particularly tedious when you have dozens of lights that you want to manage together. It would have been much more convenient to just point the integration to a group and have it handle all the lights within that group automatically.</p>

<p>The second challenge is that even though all my bulbs are from IKEA, they don’t have all the same features. This means I need separate configurations for each category to get Adaptive Lighting working correctly. But the effort is worth it: circadian rhythms are important to me, and I really want that smooth, automatic shift in color temperature from warm yellows in the morning and evenings to cooler whites and blues during midday.</p>

<h2 id="using-cursor-to-speed-up-configuration">Using Cursor to Speed Up Configuration</h2>

<p>One big leap for me this year has been leveraging <a href="https://www.cursor.com/">Cursor</a>, an AI coding assistant, to handle the more tedious parts of Home Assistant’s YAML configurations. I’ll admit, I’ve never had the time to master every detail of Home Assistant’s DSL or its configuration files.</p>

<h3 id="writing-a-custom-parser">Writing a Custom Parser</h3>

<p>The first major task I tackled with Cursor was writing a custom script to parse all my lights, figure out exactly what kind of bulb each one is, and spit out debugging information. This is the foundation of building the correct adaptive lighting setup. Once the script categorizes the bulbs, I can then create or update the YAML configuration for each bulb type.</p>

<p>Here’s the script I use to analyze my Home Assistant lights. It connects to the Home Assistant API, categorizes all lights by their capabilities, and provides detailed debugging information about their current state and supported features:</p>

  <li><strong>Run the custom parsing script</strong> on my Home Assistant setup to produce a detailed list of bulbs and their capabilities.</li>
  <li><strong>Feed the output</strong> into Cursor (in “agent mode” or similar), along with my old configuration.</li>
  <li><strong>Have Cursor generate</strong> the updated YAML for the new Adaptive Lighting system.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s been a huge time-saver. Sure, I still do some manual debugging, but I also use Cursor to assist with the troubleshooting. For instance, if something breaks in Home Assistant, I feed the logs into Cursor and ask it to help me fix the error. It’s surprisingly effective.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps-smart-trvs">Next Steps: Smart TRVs</h2>

<p>Now that the lighting is running smoothly, my next big smart home project is upgrading all my radiators with Zigbee-based smart TRVs (thermostatic radiator valves). The goal is to have each room in my home maintain an optimal temperature by reading from the central Nest thermostat. In older British homes like mine, temperature control isn’t very granular, so having each radiator adjust itself is a major comfort and efficiency boost.</p>

<p>I’ve already purchased <a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EzwaYAM">these TRVs</a> but haven’t had time to configure them yet. My plan is:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Pair the TRVs</strong> to my Zigbee network.</li>
  <li><strong>Pull temperature data</strong> from my Nest thermostat (the main sensor).</li>
  <li><strong>Set up automations</strong> in Home Assistant so that each room’s radiator valve opens or closes based on its own target temperature.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m hoping this will help solve the typical British house problem: some rooms end up too warm, while others are never warm enough. With per-room heating control, it should be far more balanced and efficient.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-so-far">Conclusion (So Far)</h2>

<p>That’s where my Home Assistant journey sits at the moment. I’m thrilled with how the adaptive lighting is working, especially now that I’ve harnessed an AI coding assistant to manage the complexity of my YAML files. The next challenge, smart radiator valves, will hopefully bring my home’s temperature control on par with my lighting automation.</p>

been cooking for the last 6 months. We’re super excited about the potential it
unlocks for the next chapter of 3D graphics on the web.</p>
<p>The new features of <strong>Svelte 5</strong> are groundbreaking for us as developers and
embracing it was also an opportunity to refine the existing APIs. Furthermore, a
lot has been happening within the world of <strong>Three.js</strong>. We’ve carved the path
for Threlte to take advantage of those developments too.</p>

<h3>January 24 2025</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/">Little Snitch</a> by Objective Development is the first app that I install on a new Mac. In fact I just bought a new Mac, an M4 MacBook Pro with nano-texture display, and I installed Little Snitch via thumb drive even before connecting the Mac to the internet. While setting up my new Mac, which came with macOS 15.2 preinstalled, I noticed that Safari attempted to connect to <code>ssl.gstatic.com</code> on launch. That domain is owned by Google!</p>
<p><img src="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2025/1/6-images/1.png" width="588" height="350" alt="Safari wants to connect to ssl.gstatic.com on TCP port 443 (https)"></p>
<p>I denied the connection, but it kept happening on every launch, despite the fact that I set Safari to open with a new private window and empty page. Moreover, it happened on every launch of Safari Technology Preview too. In the Little Snitch alert window, I pressed the info button, which revealed that the connection was initiated by Safari Search Helper, a separate process from the main Safari app.</p>
<p><img src="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2025/1/6-images/2.png" width="670" height="662" alt="Established by /System/Volumes/Preboot/Cryptexes/Incoming/OS/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/SafariShared.framework/Versions/A/XPCServices/com.apple.Safari.SearchHelper.xpc/Contents/MacOS/com.apple.Safari.SearchHelper"></p>
<p>Like most web browsers nowadays, Safari launches other processes to perform dedicated tasks. To see this in action, just search for "Safari" in Activity Monitor. The advantage of using separate processes is that each process can have separate privileges, and if one process happens to crash, it doesn't cause the entire app to crash. When an internet connection is initiated by a process launched by an app, Little Snitch attempts to attribute the connection to the main app rather than to the helper process. This attribution usually makes more sense to the Little Snitch user.</p>
<p>I haven't figured out exactly why Safari Search Helper connects to <code>ssl.gstatic.com</code>, but it's definitely related to using Google as the search engine in Safari Search Settings. If I change the search engine to DuckDuckGo, for example, the connection attempts no longer occur on launch. Indeed, if I switch the search engine back from DuckDuckGo to Google in Safari Settings popup button, a connection to <code>ssl.gstatic.com</code> occurs <em>immediately</em>. None of the other search engine choices provoke a connection. I decided to permanently deny all connections to <code>ssl.gstatic.com</code> from Safari, because there's no good reason for Safari to silently contact Google when I'm not even searching.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my new Little Snitch rule had an undesirable side effect. Although I'm trying to wean myself off, I still use Gmail, and when you set up Gmail in Mail app, it authenticates your Google account in Safari. However, the authentication kept failing for me. Looking in the Safari web inspector console, it became clear that the problem was some denied <code>ssl.gstatic.com</code> connections. Thus, I was forced to disable my Little Snitch rule and allow Safari to connect to <code>ssl.gstatic.com</code> in order to authenticate Gmail for Mail app.</p>
<p>Oddly, the <code>ssl.gstatic.com</code> connections from Safari stopped entirely after I allowed it to connect once. I discovered, comparing Safari preferences before and after, that <code>WBSOfflineSearchSuggestionsModelLastUpdateDateKey</code> had been set.</p>
<blockquote><code>defaults read com.apple.Safari WBSOfflineSearchSuggestionsModelLastUpdateDateKey</code></blockquote>
<p>I also discovered through experimentation, giving <code>WBSOfflineSearchSuggestionsModelLastUpdateDateKey</code> different date values (technically, they're string values of dates), that Safari checks for updates once a week. Thus, it was clear that Safari would make future <code>ssl.gstatic.com</code> connections, if allowed by Little Snitch. By the way, I should note that I've disabled "Include search engine suggestions" in Safari Search Settings, yet Safari is still apparently trying to download suggestions from Google?</p>
<p>What I wanted to do was create a Little Snitch rule that applied to Safari Search Helper but not to websites loaded in Safari tabs. I tried creating a new rule using the explicit path on disk of Safari Search Helper, but that didn't work. Little Snitch seemed to ignore that rule and continued to attribute Safari Search Helper connections to the Safari app.</p>
<p>I emailed Objective Development to ask whether there's any way to separate the rules in Little Snitch for the two processes, Safari and Safari Search Helper. At first, they said no, but then on reflection, they said yes!</p>
<p><img src="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2025/1/6-images/3.png" width="578" height="566" alt="Safari via com.apple.Safari.SearchHelper"></p>
<p>The trick is to use "via" in the Little Snitch rule. When you're creating the rules, enter the full file paths of the two processes, separated by "via". Little Snitch will automatically replace the paths with the process names. Make sure you match both of the processes by code signing identity too. The above rule denies <code>ssl.gstatic.com</code> connections initiated by Safari Search Helper while otherwise allowing such connections by Safari.</p>
<p>It's nice to know that this trick exists, though it's unlikely that you'll need to use it much. I thought the trick might help with Google Chrome, but it turns out that most Chrome connections are initiated by the Google Chrome Helper process: not only the web page connections but also the silent connections that run in the background, for example to <code>googleapis.com</code>, <code>accounts.google.com</code>, <code>tools.google.com</code>, <code>clients1.google.com</code>, <code>clients2.google.com</code>, <code>clients3.google.com</code>, etc. Needless to say, Google Chrome phones home a lot! It was disappointing to learn that Safari makes a silent connection to Google too. I guess that the massive yearly default search engine payment from Google to Apple buys a lot of access.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><hr><p><strong>Building resilient distributed applications remains a tough challenge.</strong></p><p>It should be possible to focus almost entirely on the business logic and the complexity inherent to the domain. Instead, you need to review line-by-line and check: <em>“what if the service crashes here?”</em>, <em>“what if the API we call here is temporarily unavailable”</em>, <em>“what if a concurrent invocation overtakes this one here”</em>, or <em>“what if this process becomes a zombie while executing this function, how do I prevent it from corrupting the state?”</em>.</p><p>As a result, you spend a huge amount of time worrying about failover strategies, retries, race conditions, locking/fencing, ordering of operations, order visibility of changes, decoupling availability, etc. They add queues, key-value stores, locking services, schedulers, workflow orchestrators and they try to get them all to play nice together. And the hard truth is, many applications don’t get it right and are not correct under failures or even under load.</p><p><img alt="Problems in distributed applications and services" src="https://restate.dev/blog/every-system-is-a-log-avoiding-coordination-in-distributed-applications/dist_app_problems.png"></p><p>How can we radically simplify this? In this article, we walk through a core idea that addresses many of these issues, by avoiding distributed coordination. Much of this goes back to learnings from when we built <a href="https://flink.apache.org/">Apache Flink</a>.</p><p>Let’s start with an observation about distributed applications and infrastructure: <strong>Every System is a log.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Message queues</strong> are logs: <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a>, <a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/">Pulsar</a>, <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2019/10/07/core-infra/scribe/">Meta’s Scribe</a> are distributed implementations of the log abstraction. Message brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ, SQS) internally replicate messages through logs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Databases</strong> (and K/V stores) are logs: changes go to the write-ahead-log first, then get materialized into the tables. The database community has the famous saying <em>“The log is the database; everything else is cache (or materialized views)”</em> - often attributed to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pathelland">Pat Helland</a>. The idea of <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2015/11/05/database-inside-out-at-oredev.html">“Turning the Database Inside Out”</a> starts with a log.</p></li><li><p>Distributed <strong>locking- and leader election services</strong> (like <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/">ZooKeeper</a>, <a href="https://etcd.io/">Etcd</a>, …) are consensus logs at their core. Consensus algorithms, like Raft, inherently model log replication.</p></li><li><p>Persistent <strong>state machines</strong> materialize logs of their state transitions.</p></li></ul><p>When you build an application or microservice that interacts, for example, with a database, a message queue, and a service API (backed by another database), you are orchestrating a handful of different logs in your business logic.</p><h2 id="applications-need-to-orchestrate-many-logs">Applications need to orchestrate many logs </h2><p>In this example, we want to implement a <code>processPayment</code> handler. The payment has an ID that identifies it. The handler is triggered from a queue (which also re-delivers the event if the handler fails or times out) and the processing involves checking a fraud detection model, updating account balance, storing the status, and sending a notification. There are other handlers that may handle the same payment ID, for example to cancel the payment, block it, unblock it, revert it.</p><p><img alt="An example, naïve implementation" src="https://restate.dev/blog/every-system-is-a-log-avoiding-coordination-in-distributed-applications/code_simple.png"></p><p>You can probably spot some issues:</p><ol><li>Concurrent invocations <em>(other handlers like “cancel”, or retries of the same event)</em> can produce arbitrary results.</li><li>A failure after line 15 means the next retry does nothing and we don’t send a notification.</li><li>If the fraud model is not completely deterministic (or if it is updated between retries), we might assume a payment is valid, crash after line 9, the retry declares the payment not valid, and we are setting the status to BLOCKED despite the fact that we withdrew the money.</li></ol><p>Nasty stuff! Let’s try to improve that.</p><p><img alt="An example, more elaborate implementation" src="https://restate.dev/blog/every-system-is-a-log-avoiding-coordination-in-distributed-applications/code_complex.png"></p><p>This second version of the code does some things better, but still has issues. One of them is around line 20, where we need to ensure that we are still the owner of the lock at the point in time where the database persists the update. That is really hard to do, because distributed lock release or re-entrance is never 100% correct, due to the impossibility of precise failure detection <em>(is a process failed or just slow or is our network partitioned?)</em>, so locking generally requires an additional fencing mechanism. Martin Kleppmann has <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html">a great blog post</a> about the rabbit hole of getting distributed locking right.</p><p>Why is it so hard to make this seemingly simple handler work reliably? Because our goal is to make consistent changes depending on the status of disparate systems, where each has its own view of the world, maintained in its separate log.</p><p>Distributed applications often need to <span>implement a complex orchestration of all the systems they interact with</span>, carefully <span>designing all states and operations, to establish order and invariants</span> that help them ensure correctness. This is the heart of much of the complexity in modern distributed applications.</p><h2 id="what-if-it-were-all-the-same-log">What if it were all the same Log? </h2><p>Now let’s assume that all these systems (queues, DBs, locks, …) operate off the same log - for the sake of this thought experiment - the log of the message queue that delivers the <code>PaymentEvent</code> to the <code>processPayment</code> handler (the <em>upstream log</em>).</p><p>Every time our <code>processPayment</code> handler wants to change some state of another system, it writes a record to the upstream log. That new record is linked to the original <code>PaymentEvent</code>. Whenever the queue decides to re-deliver the <code>PaymentEvent</code> again (e.g., under a timeout or an assumed failure), it also attaches all linked log entries (the <em>journal</em>).</p><p><img alt="Implementing a step journal into the log" src="https://restate.dev/blog/every-system-is-a-log-avoiding-coordination-in-distributed-applications/one_log_journal.png"></p><p>Now we can adjust lines 9,10,11 (the call to the fraud-detector API and storing the result) to write the result of the API call to the upstream log. When the handler is retried after a potential failure, it automatically sees whether the result was written before. This is not just efficient, but we no longer store completed steps in a shared DB where it is easy to have it accidentally picked up in unexpected ways (see <a href="https://portswigger.net/research/smashing-the-state-machine">this article</a> for how this can be a severe security and integrity loophole).</p><p>This becomes particularly useful, if we require a <em>conditional append</em> to add an entry to the log: We can only append that entry, if no newer retry was triggered. That is easy for a queue to track (it knows whether it sent the <code>PaymentEvent</code> out again) and our <code>processPayment</code> handler would quit if the conditional append failed, knowing that another retry attempt has taken over.</p><p>Now, concurrently executing retries (if the queue incorrectly assumes a handler failed and re-sent the event) can no longer corrupt the step history. This implementation gives us pretty strong workflow-style execution guarantees for our code!</p><p><img alt="Safety through conditional appends to the log" src="https://restate.dev/blog/every-system-is-a-log-avoiding-coordination-in-distributed-applications/one_log_conditional_append.png"></p><p>To make locking (line 2) and state update (line 20) work reliably, the <code>processPayment</code> handler writes the relevant events (<em>acquire lock</em>, <em>release lock</em>, <em>update state</em>) to the upstream log as well. After writing the <em>acquire lock</em> event, the handler waits until the lock service grants the lock.<br>The lock service and the database now follow the upstream log as if it was their own write-ahead log. The database can simply apply the update when it reads the event, the locking service of course only grants the lock when available (might have to wait to encounter the previous holder’s <em>release lock</em> event).</p><p><img alt="Locking and state management through the log" src="https://restate.dev/blog/every-system-is-a-log-avoiding-coordination-in-distributed-applications/one_log_lock_state.png"></p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, this pretty much eliminates all problems and corner cases we had with locks and state before: Lock acquisition and release through the upstream log and handler’s journal means we reliably keep the lock across retries. Having the update event conditionally appended to the same event journal as the lock event replaces the need for the lock’s fencing token - plus, we can be sure that we apply the update once and only once.</p><p>So, once we implement our logic like this, EVERYTHING JUST WORKS.</p><p>We can inject all sorts of failures, stalls, network partitions. As long as the log is correctly implemented, the program will always remain correct. And all that the <code>processPayment</code> handler needs to do is (1) trigger actions as conditional-log-appends and (2) skip over actions whose log entries are already attached to the <code>PaymentEvent</code>. This is super easy to implement in a library, because it doesn’t require any form of distributed coordination.</p><h2 id="if-everythings-in-one-log-theres-nothing-to-coordinate">If everything’s in one log, there’s nothing to coordinate </h2><p>We haven’t added a new distributed system primitive; in fact we’ve removed several. The benefits come from avoiding the need for coordination.</p><p>Before we started using the same log, the state was spread across systems: The status of the operation, whether a lock is held, who held it, what value a branch was based on. Because each system maintains their state as if it was independent, the different parts of the state can get out-of-sync and be altered in unexpected ways (e.g., through a race condition or zombie process). It’s hard to implement robust logic and guarantee strong invariants that way.</p><p>Having a single place (the one log) that forces a linear history of events as the ground truth and owns the decision of who can add to that ground truth, means we don’t have to coordinate much any more.</p><p>Coordination avoidance is one of the few silver bullets in distributed systems - a way to reduce complexity, rather than shift it. For example, guarding our second code snippet with a ZooKeeper lock only shifted complexity. It reduced the code’s need to worry about concurrency, but introduced issues around lost locks and cleanup of persistent locks. In contrast, the approach to unify the different states in one log actually reduced work, which resulted in higher efficiency, fewer corner cases, and easier operations.</p><p>I know what you’re thinking: That’s a nice thought experiment, but my queue/log doesn’t work like that, my database doesn’t follow some other log, and isn’t this breaking all rules for separation of concerns?</p><h2 id="adopting-this-idea-in-practice">Adopting this idea in practice </h2><p>This idea can serve as a conceptual blue-print for an architecture based on a log (e.g., Kafka) - a bit like <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2015/11/05/database-inside-out-at-oredev.html">“Turning the Database Inside Out”</a> <em>(maybe we should call this “Turning the Microservice Inside Out?”)</em>. In practice, today’s log implementations miss efficient built-in ways to track retries, make conditional-appends, link events into a journal, and would leave that to the application developer to implement.</p><p><a href="https://restate.dev/"><strong>Restate</strong></a> is an implementation of this idea. Restate Server is the broker that owns the upstream log and push-invokes the handlers with events (e.g., similar to AWS SNS and Event Bridge), ensuring reliable retries after crashes. Every event gets the latest <em>execution journal</em> (set of linked events) attached, just as described in the thought experiment above. Restate uses bi-directional streaming protocols (e.g., HTTP/2) to invoke the event handlers and send journal events and acknowledgements back and forth.</p><p><img alt="Restate in an application stack" src="https://restate.dev/blog/every-system-is-a-log-avoiding-coordination-in-distributed-applications/restate_in_the_stack.png"></p><p>The server issues a <em>unique epoch to every invocation and retry</em>, which the SDK attaches to every journal event that it sends, allowing the server to reject events from subsumed handler executions <em>(the conditional append)</em>.</p><p>The code snippet shows the example in Restate’s API <em>(here TypeScript, but Java, Kotlin, Python, Go, and Rust are supported as well)</em>. The code does not explicitly append log events, but rather uses an SDK for actions, and the SDK interacts with the log.</p><p><img alt="Example code with the Restate SDK" src="https://restate.dev/blog/every-system-is-a-log-avoiding-coordination-in-distributed-applications/code_restate.png"></p><p>To persist intermediate steps (line 8), handlers use the SDK (<code>ctx.run</code>), which sends the event to the log and awaits the ack of the conditional append to the event’s <em>execution journal</em>. On retries, the SDK checks the <em>journal</em> whether the step’s event already exists and restores the result from there directly.</p><p>Messages to other handlers are transported with exactly-once semantics (line 16). Message and RPC events are both added to the journal and routed to the destination handler. Similar to <code>ctx.run</code>, the journal deduplicates the message-sending steps. Because messages result in a single durable invocation (sequence of retries that share a journal), you can easily build end-to-end exactly-once semantics on top of this.</p><p>Restate supports handlers that lock a key when executing (and hold the lock across retries). Those handlers can read and update state that is scoped to that key. They are implemented similarly to the thought experiment: The lock and state update events are added to the journal and additionally processed by an embedded lock service and K/V store, making locks and state virtually incorruptible through partial failures, race conditions, zombie processes, etc.<br>These stateful handlers can be grouped together to share state. Restate calls that a <em>Virtual Object</em>, because the handlers are like methods with access to the object instance’s state. The state is infinitely retained in the K/V store, even when the log events eventually get garbage collected.</p><p><img alt="Virtual Objects in Restate" src="https://restate.dev/blog/every-system-is-a-log-avoiding-coordination-in-distributed-applications/virtual_object.png"></p><p>There are more building blocks in Restate, including <em>persistent Futures/Promises</em>, <em>timers</em>, or <em>idempotency-keys</em> . They all build on the same concept: Events routed through the same log, stored in the journal, and processed into a database or scheduler.</p><p>Applications often aim to create the behavior of <span>stateful, reliable, and resumable execution</span> for their critical functions. The single-log approach provides that with a single dependency and without coordination across queues, DBs, locks, and schedulers. Restate implements that pattern.</p><h2 id="blast-radius-and-separation-of-concerns">Blast radius and separation of concerns </h2><p>It would not make sense to use a single log for every operation in a distributed multi-service architecture. While it could give interesting properties, this would couple services too tightly, create a single giant blast radius, and void many benefits of service-oriented designs.</p><p>The sweet-spot we target with Restate’s implementation of this idea, is to drive all state that is strictly scoped to a handler or service through the log, plus transport of messages between services. The result is a coupling and blast radius similar to any event-driven service: If the upstream queue/log is down, the service cannot be invoked.</p><h3 id="state-in-a-database-or-in-the-log">State in a database or in the log? </h3><p>We assume that Restate is not going to replace general purpose databases. Shared databases should and will remain a part of the infrastructure, and continue to do what they are great at.</p><p>The K/V state built on the log is a great fit for state machines <em>(like the status of a payment)</em>, temporary state when joining/aggregating events and signals, or really any state that is purely updated through the event-driven handlers and scoped around a key (though a key may be something broader, like an aggregate root in Domain Driven Design).</p><p>It also gives you the building blocks for a highly robust and consistent core state. You can even use that to build overlays over other stores, track metadata like versions for entries in databases, or build data structures like semaphores. <a href="https://github.com/restatedev/examples/blob/main/typescript/patterns-use-cases/src/database/main.ts">Here is an example</a> of how to use this to make exactly-once updates to databases from handlers.</p><h2 id="whats-next">What’s next? </h2><p>If you want to try this pattern out for yourself and see and feel this idea in action, Restate is open source and you can download it at <a href="https://restate.dev/get-restate/">https://restate.dev/get-restate/</a></p><p>Today, Restate runs on a single node - similar to a Postgres database server. <span>In the next few weeks, we will release a first version of Distributed Restate</span>, supporting replication, scale out deployments, working with object store snapshots - stay tuned for more exciting updates during that release.</p><p>With the release, we will publish Part 2 of this article, which is looking at the design of the broker that maintains that log, drives the execution, retries, and implements the extensible logic to use the log for communication, locking, journaling, state, signals, scheduling, etc. As you might expect, if the core abstraction is a log, that system is a specific type of event-driven architecture.</p><p>In Part 3 of this series, we look at the implementation of the log that backs everything. Why not just use Kafka? Or just use Postgres?
In this case, we opted to develop a new type of log - something that generally one shouldn’t do, but once in a while, there is actually a good case for it. We believe that this is one of those cases, and will discuss the details of the log design, what makes it unique, and what it can do that’s hard to do with any existing implementation.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">In the good old days, scraping a webpage was as easy as making an HTTP request, cURL-like. It’s not possible anymore, because Javascript is everywhere, like it or not:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Ajax, Single Page App, infinite loading, “click to display”, instant search, etc.</li>
<li>JS web frameworks: React, Vue, Angular &amp; others</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">If we need Javascript, why not use a real web browser? Take a huge desktop application, hack it, and run it on the server. Hundreds or thousands of instances of Chrome if you use it at scale. Are you sure it’s such a good idea?</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Heavy on RAM and CPU, expensive to run</li>
<li>Hard to package, deploy and maintain at scale</li>
<li>Bloated, lots of features are not useful in headless usage</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">If we want both Javascript and performance in a true headless browser, we need to start from scratch. Not another iteration of Chromium, really from a blank page. Crazy right? But that’s we did:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Not based on Chromium, Blink or WebKit</li>
<li>Low-level system programming language (Zig) with optimisations in mind</li>
<li>Opinionated: without graphical rendering</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Status</h2><a id="user-content-status" aria-label="Permalink: Status" href="#status"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Lightpanda is still a work in progress and is currently at a Beta stage.</p>
<p dir="auto"><g-emoji alias="warning">⚠️</g-emoji> You should expect most websites to fail or crash.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here are the key features we have implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li> HTTP loader</li>
<li> HTML parser and DOM tree (based on Netsurf libs)</li>
<li> Javascript support (v8)</li>
<li> Basic DOM APIs</li>
<li> Ajax
<ul>
<li> XHR API</li>
<li> Fetch API</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> DOM dump</li>
<li> Basic CDP/websockets server</li>

This can usually be checked by looking for a sitemap.xml, there will be pages not redirected to your site that contain pages of links.</p><p>- Closely following the above, the pages may not be links to other sites but might be hosting phishing pages for other services unrelated to yours. The redirect here acts as a bluff for casual inspection of the domain. You won't see page entries in a sitemap.xml file for these ones.</p><p>- Attempting to "age" a domain. Not many talk about this option, but new domains are a red flag to a lot of automated security processes. When purchasing a domain and giving it a history associated with a legitimate service they make the domain look less suspicious for future malicious use.</p><p>- Preparation for a targeted campaign. This is pretty unlikely, you need to be really worth a dedicated long term campaign effort specifically against you or your company. If you're doing controversial/novel research, are managing millions of dollars, performing a service a state actor would object to, or have high profile clientele then maybe you fall into this category. These are patient campaigns and want to make the domain "feel normal and official". They won't do anything public with the domain such as SEO tweaking or link spam, they'll use these domains only for specific targeted one-off low-noise attacks. They're relying on staff to see that the domain has been connected to your service for years and is likely just a domain someone in marketing purchased and forgot about. This is exceptionally rare.</p></div></td></tr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
  

  
  <p>written on Friday, January 24, 2025</p>
  

  <p>Another day, another <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2016/3/24/open-source-trust-scaling/">rant</a>
<a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2022/1/10/dependency-risk-and-funding/">about</a> <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/3/26/rust-cdo/">dependencies</a>. from me.  This time I will ask you that we
start and support a vibe shift when it comes to dependencies.</p>
<p>You're probably familiar with the concept of “dependency churn.”  It's that
never-ending treadmill of updates, patches, audits, and transitive
dependencies that we as developers love to casually install in the name of
productivity.  Who doesn't enjoy waiting for yet another <cite>cargo upgrade</cite>
just so you can get that fix for a bug you don't even have?</p>
<p>It's a plague in most ecosystems with good packaging solutions.
JavaScript and Rust are particularly badly affected by that.  A brand new
Tokio project drags in 28 crates, a new Rocket project balloons that to
172, and a little template engine like MiniJinja can exist with just a
single dependency — while its CLI variant slurps up 142.</p>
<p>If that doesn't sound like a big deal, let's consider <a href="https://crates.io/crates/terminal_size">terminal_size</a>.  It is a crate that does
exactly what its name suggests: it figures out your terminal dimensions.
The underlying APIs it uses have effectively been stable since the earliest days of computing
terminals—what, 50 years or so? And yet, for one function, terminal-size
manages to introduce three or four additional crates, depending on your
operating system.  That triggers a whole chain reaction, so you end up
compiling thousands of other functions just to figure out if your terminal
is 80x25 or 120x40.  That crate had 26 releases.  My own version of that
that I have stuck away in a project from 10 years ago still works without
a single update.  Because shocker: nothing about figuring out terminal
sizes has changed.  <a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a></p>
<p>So why does <cite>terminal-size</cite> have so many updates if it's so stable?
Because it's build on top of platform abstraction libraries that
constantly churn, so it needs to update to avoid code duplication and
blowing up compile times even more.</p>
<p>But “big supply chain” will tell you that you must do it this way.  Don't
you dare to copy paste that function into your library.  Or don't you date
to use “unsafe” yourself.  You're not qualified enough to write unsafe
code, let the platform abstraction architects do that.  Otherwise someone
<a href="https://github.com/geiger-rs/cargo-geiger">will slap you</a>.  There are
entire companies who are making a living of supplying you with the tools
needed to deal with your dependency mess.  In the name of security, we're
pushed to having dependencies and keeping them up to date, despite most of
those dependencies being the primary source of security problems.</p>
<p>The goal of code in many ways should be to be written in a way that it
does not need updates.  It should eventually achieve some level of
stability.  In the Rust ecosystem stable code is punished.  If you have a
perfectly working dependency but you have a somewhat inactive bug tracker,
RUSTSEC will come by and <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/3/26/rust-cdo/">give you a chunk rating</a>.</p>
<p>But there <em>is</em> a simpler path.  You write code yourself.  Sure, it's more
work up front, but once it's written, it's done. No new crates, no waiting
for upsteam authors to fix that edge case.  If it's broken for you, you
fix it yourself.  Code that works doesn't necessarily need the
maintenance treadmill.  Your code has a corner case?  Who cares.  This is
that vibe shift we need in the Rust world: celebrating fewer dependencies
rather than more.</p>
<p>We're at a point in the most ecosystems where pulling in libraries is not
just the default action, it's seen positively: “Look how modular and
composable my code is!”  Actually, it might just be a symptom of never
wanting to type out more than a few lines.</p>
<p>Now one will make the argument that it takes so much time to write all of
this.  It's 2025 and it's faster for me to have ChatGPT or Cursor whip up
a dependency free implementation of these common functions, than it is for
me to start figuring out a dependency.  And it makes sense as for many
such small functions the maintenance overhead is tiny and much lower than
actually dealing with constant upgrading of dependencies.  The code is just
a few lines and you also get the benefit of no longer need to compile
thousands of lines of other people's code for a single function.</p>
<p>But let's face it: corporate code review culture which also has infected
Open Source software.  Companies are more likely to reward engineers than
scold them for pulling in that new “shiny library” that solves the problem
they never actually had.  That creates problems, so dependabot and friends
was born.  Today I just dread getting dependabot pull requests but on
projects but I have to accept it.  I'm part of an ecosystem with my stuff
and that ecosystem is all about churn, churn, churn.  In companies you can
also keep entire internal engineering teams busy with vendoring
dependencies, internal audits and upgrading things throughout the company.</p>
<p>Fighting this fight is incredibly hard!  Every new hire has been trained
on the idea that dependencies are great, that code reuse is great.  That
having old code sitting around is a sign of bad engineering culture.</p>
<p>It's also hard to fight this in Open Source.  Years ago I wrote <a href="https://crates.io/crates/sha1_smol">sha1-smol</a> which originally was just called
<cite>sha1</cite>.  It became the standard crate to calculate SHA1 hashes.
Eventually I was pressured to donate that package name to rust-crypto and
to depend on the rest of the crypto ecosystem as it was so established.
If you want to use the new sha1 crate, you get to enjoy 10 dependencies.
But there was just no way around it, because that name in the registry is
precious and people also wanted to have trait compatibility.  It feels
tiring to be the only person in a conversation pushing to keep the churn
down and dependencies low.</p>
<p>It's time to have a new perspective: we should give kudos to engineers who
write a small function themselves instead of hooking in a transitive web
of crates.  We should be suspicious of big crate graphs.  Celebrated are
the minimal dependencies, the humble function that just quietly does the
job, the code that doesn't need to be touched for years because it was
done right once.</p>
<p>And sure, it's not black and white.  There are the important libraries
that solve hard problems.  Graphics libraries that abstract over complex
drivers, implementations of protocols like HTTP and QUIC.  I won't be able
to get rid of tokio and I have no desire to.  But when you end up using
one function, but you compile hundreds, some alarm bell should go off.</p>
<p>We need that vibe shift.  To celebrate building it yourself when it's
appropriate to do so.  To give credit to library authors who build low to
no-dependency Open Source libraries.</p>
<p>For instance minijinja celebrates it in the readme:</p>
<pre>$ cargo tree
minimal v0.1.0 (examples/minimal)
└── minijinja v2.6.0 (minijinja)
    └── serde v1.0.144
</pre>
<p>And it has a PR to eventually <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/pull/539">get rid of the last dependency</a>.  And sometime this
year I will make it my goal to go ahead proudly and trim down all that fat
in my projects.</p>
<table id="footnote-1">
<colgroup><col><col></colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr><td><a href="#footnote-reference-1">[1]</a></td><td>Disclaimer: you will need one dependency for UNIX: <cite>libc</cite>.  That's
because Rust does not expose the platform's libc constants to you, and
they are not standarized.  That however is such a common and
lightweight dependency that you won't be able to avoid it anyways.</td></tr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a> is the de facto standard Docker registry, literally, if you don't specify a registry when pulling an image Docker will invisibly prepend <code>docker.io/</code> to it. That bit is fair enough really, it's their software and their registry platform so why not prefer it? From the beginning of the Linuxserver project we used Docker Hub as our primary registry; as we grew we started mirroring our images to Gitlab and Quay.io, more as a backup than anything else, there was no reason for us to have concerns about the stability or functionality of Docker Hub, until...</p>
<p>In 2020 Docker announced that they would start <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201101055027/https://www.docker.com/blog/scaling-dockers-business-to-serve-millions-more-developers-storage">purging old images</a> and introducing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201101055027/https://www.docker.com/blog/scaling-docker-to-serve-millions-more-developers-network-egress/">pull limits</a> for unpaid accounts and unauthenticated users - for some reason they've scrubbed these posts from their blog, hence the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> links.</p>
<p>This concerned us, and many other users, deeply, not just because of the changes - our CI account is on a paid plan so wouldn't have been directly affected - but because of the direction of travel it indicated and the potential impact to our users. Around the same time, Github launched its own container registry, GHCR, which was an evolution of their existing packages registry. This prompted us to consider changing our primary registry and later that year we started updating our documentation to use ghcr.io as the registry for all our examples. In 2021 we partnered with <a href="https://app.scarf.sh/">Scarf</a> to set up <a href="https://www.linuxserver.io/blog/wrap-up-warm-for-the-winter">lscr.io</a> as a frontend registry for all our images, but retained ghcr.io as the backend provider. In 2023, Docker Hub announced that they were <a href="https://www.linuxserver.io/blog/docker-team-changes">sunsetting Free Team Organisations</a>, meaning your options were going to be free individual user accounts, or paid team accounts. While we would have been protected from the changes, Docker ultimately decided not to go forward with them, after user backlash.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we applied for and were granted membership of the <a href="https://www.docker.com/community/open-source/">Docker-Sponsored Open Source (DSOS) program</a>. The application process was messy and slow, but it meant we were no longer subject to the pull limits and image purging of a free account.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to October 2024: we were preparing for our annual DSOS renewal. This process is <em>abysmal</em>, there's no way to apply to roll over membership, or even a renewal process per se, you have to reapply from scratch every year using the same badly-designed form that they hilariously describe as a "new, streamlined application process [that] lets you apply with a single click and provides status updates along the way". The confirmation email notifies you that the application process can take up to a month, so we waited as usual. A month came and went without any update beyond the initial automated reply. In mid-November our DSOS status expired, reverting our account to Free Teams status and removing all the benefits of DSOS membership.</p>
<p>We reached out to Docker via the contact email they provide (opensource@docker.com), although it's worth noting that they do not publish it anywhere related to the DSOS program application process, and did not receive any response, not even a "This mailbox is no longer monitored". Twice more we attempted to reach out to them about the status of our application, but still have yet to receive a response.</p>
<p>We're now 3 months on from our renewal submission, with zero communication from Docker, an account that is no longer part of the DSOS program, and no obvious way to speak to a human about it. We could resubmit the form, but why would that go any differently to last time? There's clearly no point in using the email address as it is seemingly ignored. We do have some contacts who work at Docker but they're engineers, not responsible for Docker Hub's account management, and we don't want to make this their problem. We're going to try logging a regular support ticket but as we're now on a free account we're not hopeful of getting a helpful response.</p>
<p>It's hard to know if we've just fallen through the cracks somehow or if there are more systemic issues going on within the Docker organisation at the moment, but this feels like the kind of process that should have some degree of resilience to it if you're going to offer it to people, and frankly the lack of a straightforward renewal option has always been kind of unacceptable.</p>
<p>All of this has made us seriously reconsider what we do going forwards; we obviously won't pull all our images off Docker Hub, nor is it sensible to just stop pushing new images as it will seriously impact the many users we have who pull from there and don't read these blog posts or generally keep track of what we're up to as an organisation, but it <em>does</em> feel like we need to do something. Whatever we decide, we'll keep you informed.</p>
<p>Side note: If you're reading this and you work for Docker in some relevant capacity, give us a hint as to what we're supposed to do here, we'd really appreciate it.</p>

<p dir="auto">Someone just tried the most sophisticated phishing attack I've ever seen. I almost fell for it. My mind is a little blown.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Someone named "Chloe" called me from 650-203-0000 with Caller ID saying "Google". She sounded like a real engineer, the connection was super clear, and she had an American accent. <a href="https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/81188c87-f090-4bc0-a8c1-9f2b1a4e309a">Screenshot.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">They said that they were from Google Workspace and someone had recently gained access to my account, which they had blocked. They asked me if I had recently logged in from Frankfurt, Germany and I said no.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">I asked if they can confirm this is Google calling by emailing me from a Google email and they said sure and sent me this email and told me to look for a case number in it, which I saw in the email string. I asked why it said important.g.co and she said it was an internal Google subnet.</p>

<ol start="3" dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">I asked if I could call back a phone number listed on Google.com and she said sure - this number is listed on google.com and you can call back with your case number, but there may be a wait on hold and I might get a different agent. I googled it and sure enough, it was listed on google.com pages. I didn't call back though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">I said OK: what do you want me to do? She said we could do the sessions reset entirely from my devices and she wouldn't need any info from me. So I said sure, let me know how to. Then I realize I should check the Google Workspace logs and didn't see any login attempts from weird IPs. I asked her where I could find the attempt they were talking about and she gave me detailed instructions and said it's strange it's not showing up, and maybe it'll show after the caches reload. She offered to transfer me to a manager. I declined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">We talked further for maybe 5 minutes as I was looking through my Google Workspace logs trying to find anything, then the call dropped mid-sentence while she was talking. Then I got a call back 30 seconds later from "Solomon", her manager, saying he heard I was having trouble navigating the Google Workspace admin logs and could show me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">We went back and forth, he explained the account was probably compromised through an adblocker Chrome Extension that hijacked the Gmail credentials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">As we talked, he said a few things that made me more suspicious. I then asked him to show me where on Google.com I could find this phone number and he had me type out <a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/7690269?hl=en" rel="nofollow">https://support.google.com/business/answer/7690269?hl=en</a>, which sure enough has it - though it's listed under "Google Assistant". Suspicious. I asked if I could call the number back, and he said no - which different from what "Chloe" said. Suspicious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">I then said "sure, let's reset the account" to see what he wanted me to do. Then he said OK - open up Gmail on your phone and let me show you how to log out all other active devices before you reset your password so the Frankfurt computer will get logged out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">He then said: OK, I just sent a reset code to you. It should pop up on your screen and say "84", which sure enough 84 was one of the 3 codes displayed. He said just tap it, then all sessions besides your phone will be signed out. That would have given him access to my account!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Then I started recording the call when I was certain this was a phishing attempt. <a href="https://cloud-3s03ljpcy-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0call_recording.m4a" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the call recording for the last 7 minutes. Note: my iOS device played a recording notification to him when this started recording.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">He had me load up "his" LinkedIn account to verify who he was and that he worked at Google. Then he eventually sent me a super scammy 2 factor text code and hung up on me after I asked more questions about how they did this.</p>
</li>

<p dir="auto">The thing that's crazy is that if I followed the 2 "best practices" of verifying the phone number + getting them to send an email to you from a legit domain, I would have been compromised.</p>
<p dir="auto">I understand how they were able to spoof the "Google" phone call through Google Assistant, but I have no idea how they got access to important.g.co. g.co is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.co" rel="nofollow">legitimate</a> Google URL.</p>
<p dir="auto">Literally 1 button press from being completely pwned. And I'm pretty technical!</p>
