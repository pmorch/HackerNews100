<h2 id="0-how-i-came-up-with-the-idea">How I came up with the idea.</h2>







<p><br>Yes, I know that the mouse is quite questionable in terms of convenience, but the main driver of my idea was these two clips.</p>



<p>Some time ago, I saw this video and immediately thought of what I needed to do to solve the author‚Äôs problem:</p>







<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>A year later, I saw this video and decided my time had come:</p>







<figure><p>
<iframe title="I Tried Building the ULTIMATE Magic Mouse" width="1778" height="1000" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y3lNrRydr4g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<h2 id="1-the-idea">The idea</h2>



<p>It became obvious to me that I should just charge the battery and do not to connect mouse schematics, well as it turns out it worked. Not without some interesting findings, though.</p>



<p>To make it ergonomic and prevent problems with the sensor (which is not working perfectly as it is) I will have to divide the mouse into 2 halves. I was prepared to have to lengthen the cable from the top part (touch sensor), but luckily, the standard length turned out to be enough.</p>







<h2 id="2-implementation">Implementation</h2>



<p>The found models did not fit at all. I had to do it myself, and the first attempts were quite ‚Ä¶. ugly, what can I say?</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="850" src="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.jpg?resize=1024%2C850&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.jpg?resize=1024%2C850&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.jpg?resize=300%2C249&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.jpg?resize=768%2C637&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.jpg?w=1465&amp;ssl=1 1465w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>







<p>Moreover, all the Magic Mouse 3d models I‚Äôve found aren‚Äôt perfect either. So, I adjusted the shape of the enclosure step by step, just by eye. It‚Äôs a concept, after all üôÇ<br>Create-&gt; print -&gt; Adjust -&gt; print -&gt; Adjust -&gt; print -&gt; etc‚Ä¶</p>

<p>A last, but probably not the final option. After all, there is no limit to perfection. But if I were to perfect it, I‚Äôm afraid the project would never see the light of day</p>

<p>In the photo, you can notice a frame-adapter for the upper part of the mouse. It was made in only four iterations</p>

<p>Its task is essentially to repeat and extend the original mount (which, by the way, is quite difficult to disassemble without breaking anything off).<br>There is also a place for a spring (a long metal part near the button) and an offset lever that presses the button.</p>

<p>I was so confident of success that I didn‚Äôt even bother to see if the charging idea would work.<br>Better late than never. The labeling on the battery is not standard (3.61V), but according to the tests, it is a normal one cell that can be charged to 4.2V, which is defined as 100% in the OS.</p>

<p>When I charge the battery using my BMC (TP4056) the mouse is not aware that it is in the process of charging.<br>The TP4056 raises the voltage to ~4.258V when the charge is complete. And then shuts down, and the battery stays at ~4.2V.</p>



<p>So here‚Äôs the finding:<br>If we monitor the percentage of charge in the OS, we see <strong>100%</strong> at 4.15, and then the wonders begin.<br>At ~4.17V, the percentage drops to <strong>99%</strong>.<br>~4.19V ‚Äì <strong>98%</strong><br>~4.21V ‚Äì <strong>97%</strong><br>~4.24V ‚Äì <strong>96%</strong><br>After charging is finished and I restarted the mouse, the percentage is back to <strong>100%</strong>.<br>Maybe I‚Äôve found why the mouse is magical? üôÇ</p>

</div></div>


<p>Next, I soldered a regular TP4056 directly to the battery outputs. Don‚Äôt have to make it complicated. With this battery capacity, it will do the job just fine, there is no need for additional current limiters. Just in case, I monitored the temperature while charging, and everything seemed to be working great.</p>

<p>Wear goggles and have fire extinguishers handy. Trained professionals perform these stunts.</p>

<h2>Assembling</h2>



<p>As in most advanced devices, I used double-sided tape to glue the battery on.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="771" src="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.jpg?resize=1024%2C771&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.jpg?resize=1024%2C771&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.jpg?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.jpg?resize=768%2C578&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>







<p>However, double-sided tape was mostly used for assembly as well. By the way, for the first time, I tried printing on an FDM printer at 60 microns (0.06mm) resolution.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="771" src="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12.jpg?resize=1024%2C771&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12.jpg?resize=1024%2C771&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12.jpg?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12.jpg?resize=768%2C578&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>







<p>I installed this adapter into the top of the mouse and taped it to the battery so it could be disassembled for fine-tuning. Once the exact position has been selected, it makes sense to glue it firmly in place and snap the top part into place.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="771" src="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13.jpg?resize=1024%2C771&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13.jpg?resize=1024%2C771&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13.jpg?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13.jpg?resize=768%2C578&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/uplab.pro/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Trying on</figcaption></figure>

<p>And then there‚Äôs the final view. I added high-tech hot glue (sarcasm) to secure the wires and USB-C port. If it works, why think of anything else?</p>



		<figure>
			
			
		</figure>
		






<p>Carefully connected the FFC cable and secured it with the native fasteners.<br>I added double-sided tape to the plastic extension adapter and simply taped it to the battery at the very end.</p>

<p>Final demo</p>



		<figure>
			
			
		</figure>
		






<p>That‚Äôs it.</p>



<h2>Sources</h2>



<p>repository in progress</p>



<h2>One more thing</h2>



<p>When I started working on the project, I immediately had very global plans.</p>



<p><br>Namely:</p>



<ol>
<li>Add RGB backlighting.</li>



<li>Add a Raspberry Pi RP2040 with an accelerometer to activate the backlighting.</li>



<li>Consider installing additional buttons connecting RP2040 to the Macbook with a separate BT channel or cable.</li>



<li>Install an additional battery to ensure the operation of the backlighting.</li>
</ol>



<p>Fortunately, I came to my senses in time. </p>

<p>But you know, sometimes it‚Äôs so hard to stop yourself.</p>

Panic attacks, I‚Äôve learned, come like an ambulance flashing lights and blaring a siren indicating that my mind and my body are‚Ä¶ experiencing a missed connection in terms of communication ‚Äî they‚Äôre refusing to listen to each other. More accurately: my mind is disregarding the messages from my body, convinced she can think her way through feelings, and so my body goes into panic mode like she‚Äôs on strike."</li><li id="block97">Annie then basically proceeds to mention that "panic attack" doesn't quite feel like her first memory, but doesn't decisively settle on a "first memory." She concludes the article: "TBD on the first memory of that history. Here‚Äôs to exploring."<ol><li id="block98">This becomes relevant later on, as Annie ends up remembering an earlier memory than her panic attacks - Sam sexually assaulting her.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li id="block99"><a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/period-lost-period-found-bbc416865830">Period lost, period found</a> - published Feb 21, 2019<ol><li id="block100">Annie started taking Zoloft at age 13 to help with symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Anxiety, and Depression.</li><li id="block101">Annie tapered herself off of Zoloft at age 22.</li><li id="block102">Annie graduated from college with a major in Biopsychology, a minor and dance, and also completed all of the prerequisite courses for medical school.</li><li id="block103">After graduation, Annie chose not to pursue a pre-med route, opting instead to focus on movement, writing, comedy, music, and food.

She was never going to be an <i>√úbermensch. </i>She‚Äôs always been someone who felt the pain of the world. <u>At age 5, she began waking up in the middle of the night, needing to take a bath to calm her anxiety. By 6, she thought about suicide, though she didn‚Äôt know the word.</u>"</li><li id="block127">&nbsp;"When I visited Annie on Maui this summer, she told me stories that will resonate with anyone who has been the emo-artsy person in a businessy family, or who has felt profoundly hurt by experiences family members seem not to understand. Annie ‚Äî her long dark hair braided, her voice low, measured, and intense ‚Äî <u>told me about visiting Sam in San Francisco in 2018. He had some friends over. One of them asked Annie to sing a song she‚Äôd written. She found her ukulele. She began. ‚ÄúMidway through, Sam gets up wordlessly and walks upstairs to his room,‚Äù</u> she told me over a smoothie in Paia, a hippie town on Maui‚Äôs North Shore. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm like, <i>Do I keep playing? Is he okay? What just happened?</i>‚Äù The next day, she told him she was upset and asked him why he left. ‚ÄúAnd he was kind of like, ‚ÄòMy stomach hurt,‚Äô or ‚ÄòI was too drunk,‚Äô or ‚Äòtoo stoned, I needed to take a moment.‚Äô And I was like, ‚ÄòReally? That moment? You couldn‚Äôt wait another 90 seconds?‚Äô‚Äù That same year, Jerry Altman died. He‚Äôd had his heart issues, along with a lot of stress, partly, Annie told me, from driving to Kansas City to nurse along his real-estate business. The Altmans‚Äô parents had separated. Jerry kept working because he needed the money. After his death, Annie cracked. Her body fell apart. Her mental health fell apart. She‚Äôd always been the family‚Äôs pain sponge. She absorbed more than she could take now. <u>Sam offered to help her with money for a while, then he stopped. In their email and text exchanges, his love ‚Äî and leverage ‚Äî is clear. He wants to encourage Annie to get on her feet. He wants to encourage her to get back on Zoloft, which she‚Äôd quit under the care of a psychiatrist because she hated how it made her feel.</u> Among her various art projects, Annie makes a podcast called <i>All Humans Are Human.</i> The first Thanksgiving after their father‚Äôs death, all the brothers agreed to record an episode with her. <u>Annie wanted to talk on air about the psychological phenomenon of projection: what we put on other people. The brothers steered the conversation into the idea of feedback</u> ‚Äî specifically, how to give feedback at work. After she posted the show online, Annie hoped her siblings, particularly Sam, would share it. He‚Äôd contributed to their brothers‚Äô careers. Jack‚Äôs company, Lattice, had been through YC. <u>‚ÄúI was like, ‚ÄòYou could just tweet the link. That would help. You don‚Äôt want to share your sister‚Äôs podcast that you came on?‚Äô‚Äù He did not. ‚ÄúJack and Sam said it didn‚Äôt align with their businesses.‚Äù</u></li><li id="block128">"In May 2020, she relocated to the Big Island of Hawaii. One day, shortly after she‚Äôd moved to a farm to do a live-work trade, she got an email from Sam <u>asking for her address.</u> He wanted to send her a memorial diamond he‚Äôd made out of some of their father‚Äôs ashes. ‚ÄúPicturing him sending a diamond of my dad‚Äôs ashes to the mailbox where it‚Äôs one of those rural places where there are all these open boxes for all these farms ‚Ä¶ It was so heavy and sad and angering, but it was also so hilarious and so ridiculous. So disconnected-feeling. Just the lack of fucks given.‚Äù Their father never asked to be a diamond. <u>Annie‚Äôs mental health was fragile. She worried about money for groceries.</u> It was hard to interact with somebody for whom money meant everything but also so little. ‚ÄúLike, either you aren‚Äôt realizing or you are not caring about this whole situation here,‚Äù she said. By ‚Äúwhole situation,‚Äù she meant her life.<u> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre willing to spend $5,000 ‚Äî for each one ‚Äî to make this thing that was your idea, not Dad‚Äôs, and you‚Äôre wanting to send that to me instead of sending me $300 so I can have food security. What?‚Äù</u>"</li><li id="block129">"The two are now estranged. <u>Sam offered to buy Annie a house. She doesn‚Äôt want to be controlled.</u> For the past three years, she has supported herself doing sex work, ‚Äúboth in person and virtual,‚Äù she told me. She posts porn on OnlyFans. She posts on Instagram Stories about mutual aid, trying to connect people who have money to share with those who need financial help."</li><li id="block130">"<span>Annie has moved more than 20 times in the past year.</span> When she called me in mid-September, her housing was unstable yet again. She had $1,000 in her bank account. <u>Since 2020, she has been having flashbacks.</u> She knows everybody takes the bits of their life and arranges them into narratives to make sense of their world. <u>As Annie tells her life story, Sam, their brothers, and her mother kept money her father left her from her.</u> As Annie tells her life story, she felt special and loved when, as a child, Sam read her bedtime stories. <u>Now those memories feel like abuse.</u> The Altman family would like the world to know: ‚ÄúWe love Annie and will continue our best efforts to support and protect her, as any family would.‚Äù Annie is working on a one-woman show called the <i>HumAnnie</i> about how nobody really knows how to be a human.

I believe this because:<i>&nbsp;</i><ol><li id="block139">Sam Altman posted a link on Twitter in 2018 to Annie's YouTube channel ("Go check out my sister on Youtube!")&nbsp;</li><li id="block140">Annie did an episode for her podcast featuring her brothers Sam Altman, Jack Altman, and Max Altman in 2018.&nbsp;</li><li id="block141">There are old newspaper reports in various places around the Internet listing Annie as a sibling of Sam, Jack, and Max Altman in, for example, obituary-type webpages related to the death and funeral of their father, Jerry Altman.&nbsp;</li><li id="block142">Both Sam Altman and Annie Altman spoke personally to Elizabeth Weil of nymag for her "Sam Altman Is the Oppenheimer of Our Age" article she published in Sept. 2023.&nbsp;<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/hgtgosg2nmisod5bzwft" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/jn9vaml8znaw7n3ydggr 150w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/hwxtvddzrx0gkdtkguun 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/xflg8zxlzglj4v09z79h 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/tmxgucyjfzgcpkjahxdk 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/jlbdngbvbc3l0ftvrwgu 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/ntjgldwhpmhq8anbzien 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/mgvucqbi9sh7cqhuifqq 1050w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/w8wbqu57pvd30lf6glwd 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/ctxv8ureykhdgkqpoomk 1350w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/kzjjjmj73n8sf8bmgfif 1446w"><i>Picture is taken from </i><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html"><i>this article</i></a><i>.

I believe this because:<ol><li id="block144">Sam shared a link to Annie's Youtube channel in 2018. From this, I infer he is aware of her other social media profiles, where she has made her claims about Sam.</li><li id="block145">Sam and Annie both personally interviewed Elizabeth Weil for her September 2023 nymag article. The article was published, and I infer that Sam, having consented to be interviewed for the article, knows that the article exists and has read it.</li></ol></li><li id="block146">Annie Altman has been posting consistently about being abused by Sam Altman (and Jack Altman, to a lesser extent) for about 4 years (~2019-present) across multiple social media platforms. Annie is largely self-consistent with the claims she makes over time.</li><li id="block147">In my view, Annie's claims have been paid little attention, considering the power and notoriety of the person about whom she is making them - Sam Altman - and the seriousness of the claims she has been making. Besides Elizabeth Weil's nymag article (<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html">here</a>), there has been virtually <i>zero</i> (mainstream) media coverage of the extremely serious claims that Annie has consistently made many, many times against Sam Altman over the past 4 years.&nbsp;</li></ol><p id="block148"><i><span>So -- </span></i><span>since it seems like no writer or journalist on the planet, besides me, for some reason, has ever properly answered this question</span>, I'll take a swing at it:<i>&nbsp;</i></p><p id="block149"><i>What exactly has Annie Altman claimed about Sam Altman</i>?</p><h2 id="My_Personal_Understanding_Interpretation_of_Annie_s_story_and_the_chronology_of_her_life"><u>My Personal Understanding/Interpretation of Annie's story and the chronology of her life</u></h2><p id="block150">The following provides a chronology of Annie's life that I have constructed from her claims. This is <i>my understanding of her claims. </i>This is <i>not</i> me asserting that the following <i>has been proven to be true</i>, as it has not.</p><ol><li id="block151">In ~1998, when Annie is 4 years old, a 13-years-old Sam Altman non-consensually climbs into her bed (<i>implied</i>: sexually assaults Annie.) The specifics are unclear. All that Annie has stated is that Sam was something like her "first {sex work} client", that he used her to "help him figure out his sexuality", and that her brothers "touched her." (<i>implied</i>: in an inappropriate / nonconsensual way that would be classified as sexual abuse.)<ol><li id="block152">Annie, being 4 years old, does not form a concrete memory of this event that she fully understands / comprehends / accepts. That is, as she grows up and develops higher consciousness, sentience, intelligence, and self-awareness, <i>she does not remember what Sam did to her</i>, due to the fact that, when Sam sexually assaulted her (when she was 4 years old), <i>her brain was extremely young, and the event was extremely traumatic for her younger self in a way that was hard for her to even conceptualize, much less understand and remember</i>. Instead, Annie's "remembrances" of Sam's sexual assault of her manifest as extreme anxiety and suicidal thoughts around the age of 5-6, and emotional and mental problems (e.g. issues with relationship with her own body, needing to take antidepressants, depression, etc.)</li></ol></li><li id="block153">Around age 5-6, Annie starts dealing with extreme anxiety and suicidal ideation. As Annie puts it, she "{tells} her birth mother about wanting to end this life thing and being touched by older siblings, and said 'mother' decided to instead protect her sons and demand to receive therapy and chores only from her female child."</li><li id="block154">As she grows up, though Annie does not have a complete memory of the sexual abuse she experienced in her early childhood, she practically embodies the dictionary definition of "symptoms common in those who have experienced sexual abuse in early childhood." Panic attacks, depression, body image problems, eating disorders, anxiety, suicidal thoughts - the list goes on.</li><li id="block155">Annie <a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/period-lost-period-found-bbc416865830">starts using Zoloft at age 13</a> to help with symptoms of OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), anxiety, and depression. She eventually tapers herself off of Zoloft at age 22.<ol><li id="block156">Zoloft becomes relevant again later on in Annie's chronology.</li></ol></li><li id="block157">Annie enters college. She ends up finishing college early (even though she was <a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/my-denied-appeal-letter-for-early-college-graduation-dcd0ca74bca2">trying to graduate even earlier</a>, I think?). However, upon graduating, she is extremely depressed, and ends up forsaking the medical school route. Instead, she seeks out a place to live that, as <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sam-altman-artificial-intelligence-openai-profile.html">Elizabeth Weil writes</a>, "felt better to her. She wanted to make art." <a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/period-lost-period-found-bbc416865830">In Annie's own words</a>, she "majored in Biopsychology in college, with a minor in dance, and took all the prerequisite courses for medical school. Then I noped out of the pre-med route to focus on movement, writing, comedy, music, and food. I got certified as a yoga teacher, worked for an online CSA (community-supported agriculture) company, began writing more frequently, started slowly going to open mic nights and putting videos on YouTube, and began a podcast and this blog."</li><li id="block158">At some point in 2018, Annie visits Sam in San Francisco and plays ukulele to an audience including Sam and his friends. While she is playing the ukulele, Sam abruptly, wordlessly gets up and walks upstairs to his room (as reported in the nymag article; see above.)&nbsp;<ol><li id="block159">The next day, Sam says something along the lines of "his stomach hurt" or "he was too drunk/stoned" or "he needed to take a moment."

She sells some items, returns to an older job, and, for the first time, asks her millionaire brothers/relatives for money, who proceed to haggle her about it and give her a hard time. She does "two family therapy sessions", which terminate when she is professionally advised to stop doing such sessions.</li><li id="block171">She moves back to Big Island (Hawai'i.) For some reason, Sam offers to send her a diamond of her Dad's ashes, even though 1) Annie is low on cash, and could use cash much more than an expensive Dad-ashes-diamond, and 2) Annie's Dad wanted just cremation, not diamond-ification. Annie finds this to be a very odd / insensitive gesture.</li><li id="block172">At this point, Annie has begun speaking out against Sam on social media. She has also begun "survival sex work." That is, because she was sick and broke, her options for (more conventional forms of) employment were very limited, and thus she was forced to resort to sex work to financially support herself.</li><li id="block173">In 2020, Sam offers to buy Annie a house...but there's strings attached. She has to meet with a Sam Altman lawyer. Annie sees this as an attempt by Sam to increase his control over her / suppress her (and her speaking out against him on social media.) She <i>refuses</i> his offer (which she frequently references as a "no contact" or "no family" decision.)</li><li id="block174">In 2020, Annie begins having <i>intense</i>, nearly day-long flashbacks, which last for 18 months. That is -<i> she begins to remember, and realize, that Sam Altman sexually assaulted her at age 4</i>.&nbsp;<ol><li id="block175">From what I understand, these flashbacks are a part of PTSD (relating to Sam's sexual assault of her 4-year-old self) that Annie begins to experience (she mentions PTSD specifically <a href="https://twitter.com/phuckfilosophy/status/1710039374224933175">here</a> and <a href="https://theanniealtmanshow.medium.com/an-open-letter-to-the-emdr-trauma-therapist-who-fired-me-for-doing-sex-work-f5f537218b45">here</a>.)</li></ol></li><li id="block176">Annie seems to think (<a href="https://twitter.com/phuckfilosophy/status/1709629089366348100">here</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/phuckfilosophy/status/1709629659242242058">here</a>) that Sam was hoping that Annie would die or commit suicide before she could do too much damage to Sam' s reputation, carrying her knowledge to the grave.</li><li id="block177">Annie continues to speak out against Sam on social media, including through various posts on Twitter/X (c.f. the <i>Relevant excerpts from Annie's social media accounts</i> section of this post.)</li><li id="block178">In 2023, some of Annie's X posts receive newfound attention / rediscovery on X.<ol><li id="block179">One of the people who sees them first the first time is me.

The brothers steered the conversation into the idea of feedback ‚Äî specifically, how to give feedback at work. After she posted the show online, Annie hoped her siblings, particularly Sam, would share it. He‚Äôd contributed to their brothers‚Äô careers.

The idea of recovered memories was already discredited decades ago after the peak of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_panic">satanic ritual abuse hysteria/panic</a> of the 80's.  At its peak some parents were jailed based on testimonies of children, children that had been coerced (both deliberately and indirectly) into recanting fantastical, increasingly outlandish tales of satanic baby eating rituals.  The FBI even eventually investigated and found 0 evidence, but the turning point was when some lawyers and psychiatrists started winning lawsuits against the psychologists and social workers at the center of the recovered memory movement.</p>
<p>Memories change every time they are rehearsed/reimagined; the magnitude of such change varies and can be significant, and the thin separation between imaginings (imagined memories, memories/stories of others, etc) and 'factual' memories doesn't really erode so much as not really exist in the first place.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, some people's detailed memories from childhood are probably largely accurate, but some detailed childhood memories are complete confabulations based on internalization of external evidence, and some are later confabulations based on attempts to remember or recall and extensive dwelling on the past, and some are complete fiction.

Memory loss has been reported in people who have experienced natural disasters, accidents, war trauma, kidnapping, torture, concentration camps, and physical and sexual abuse. Total memory loss is most common in childhood sexual abuse, with incidence ranging from 19 percent to 38 percent. This issue is not particularly controversial: As early as 1980 the DSM-III recognized the existence of memory loss for traumatic events in the diagnostic criteria for dissociative amnesia: ‚Äúan inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by normal forgetfulness.‚Äù Memory loss has been part of the criteria for PTSD since that diagnosis was first introduced.</p><p>One of the most interesting studies of repressed memory was conducted by Dr. Linda Meyer Williams, which began when she was a graduate student in sociology at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 1970s</p></blockquote><p>... <span>(read more)</span></p></div><div id="PDyHgqK5aWGnWpt5W"><p>I know someone who recovered memories of repeated abuse including from the age of four later in their teenage years.

For instance, things like "they told their mother about the abuse when they were four, and the mother remembered that this conversation happened." Or "the parents spoke to the abuser and he basically admitted it." There was also suicidal ideation at around age six (similarity to Annie's story). In addition, the person remembers things like, when playing with children's toy figures (human-like animals), they would not play with these toy figures like ordinary children and instead think about plots that involve bleeding between legs and sexual assault.

Is it true that someone with psychosis (assuming your judgement is correct) making an allegation of sexual abuse is more likely to be lying/mistaken than not?&nbsp;

I.e someone with psychosis making a claim like the above is less likely than someone without psychosis to be accurately interpreting reality, but is their claim more likely to be false than not? Your argument leans heavily on her having psychosis. Do people with psychosis make more false allegations of sexual assault that true allegations?&nbsp;

Breiding et al., 2014 estimates that around 19.3% of women in the US have been sexually assaulted. Assuming the rate is similar for people with psychosis, more than 1 in 5 women with psychosis would need to make false allegations for the base assumption to be "person has psychosis therefore their sexual assault claim is more likely false than true".</p></div></span></p></div></div></div><div id="nMNwxrMJdQTGzDyBf"><p>Bayes can judge you now: your analysis is half-arsed, which is not a good look when discussing a matter as serious as this. &nbsp;</p><p>All you‚Äôve done is provide one misleading statistic.

<p>A priori when a person makes a bunch of unlikely accusations in public, it would have been reasonable to first consider this as evidence of them not being truthful and sane.

It's probably partly that, but it's also partly that it's considered impolite to point out when someone is mentally ill. In part this is because unfortunately doing so can strengthen a paranoid person's feeling of persecution.

When a friend of mine suffered a psychotic break, she had many technology related delusions, and she reached out to me for advice because I work in technology. I wasn't sure how to handle it so I consulted a professional. Under their advice, I gave her general advice on how to protect herself from breaches (strong passwords, HTTPS everywhere extension, etc.) and didn't otherwise try to disillusion her. My role as a friend was to stay her friend, not try to break her delusions. Paranoid people already have enough enemies, imaginary though they may be.&nbsp;

Of course, once delusions have been put into print, it's now a public forum. (One might question the ethics of publishing such an article). But politeness norms often extend into public forums.&nbsp;

This doesn't mean that these dissmissed women were indeed psychotic and/or wrong in their allegitions. Pre-me-too perception of the world is at least not necessarily more accurate.

If anything, happening of Me-Too movement is an evidence in favor of base rates of sexual assault being highter. You can't use it existence to lower the probability estimate of this particular allegation being true, without contradicting conservation of expected evidence.

Similarly, with mental health issues. They can be downstream of sexual abuse or they can lead to falsly believing that you were abused. Priviledging one hypothesis over the other requires some kind of evidence. What are the rates of abused person developping mental health issues, similar to what can be observed of Annie Altman? What are the rates of people with similar to Annie Altman issues having delusions about sexual assault?

You are comparing wrong numbers. As I've already said what we need to compare is the rate of this kind of mental health symptoms among people who were not sexually abused in their childhood and then developped delusions about sexual assualt with the probability of people being sexually abused in their childhood and then developping this kind of simptoms. This will give us a prior to distinguish between two hypothesis.&nbsp;

All the other complications like shadowbanning, family members conspiring, being written out of the will, etc. are not relevant to the main issue. A scenario where a girl was sexually abused as by her brothers, which resulted in her devolopping mental health issues, which lead her to inaccurately believe that she is shadowbanned in the internet isn't absolving for the brothers. Of course if the other allegations are also true/partially true it makes the situation even more severe. But they have to be examined on their own and not dissmissed all together.</p></div></span></p></div></div></div><div id="htzd7BtAA9upCLkPL"><div><p>I'm confused about and skeptical of the justifiability of all the downvotes this post received.</p><ol><li>If the allegations are true, well, I'm <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QDczBduZorG4dxZiW/sam-altman-s-sister-annie-altman-claims-sam-has-severely?commentId=hcqiBJCAKuXqC9tKP">not sure</a> how important exactly it is, but it seems at least like it passes the bar of "worth knowing about" pretty easily.</li><li>If something passes that bar pretty easily, I guess the next question is how plausible it is.

I think, though I did a pretty good job with being rational in this post, and trying to make rational, unbiased claims from/using the information that exists, I could have been a bit more refined and clear-cut.

I honestly feel a bit bad, because this is an important issue, and I hope I didn't screw things up by (unintentionally) presenting things in a irrational or biased way. I'll try to be very rational and unbiased in this comment.

I think my statement that I was "trying to figure out the truth" in an earlier comment was misguided and imprecise. You were keen to notice this. In a situation like this, there are large amounts of uncertainty, and there is currently no proof of misconduct (that I've seen.)

I think what this post does is {provide a (relatively) accurate description of the state of affairs regarding Annie's claims.} I do feel pretty good about the way in which I presented the information relevant to this matter in this post. Though I don't want to necessarily "take shots" at Elizabeth Weil, whose nymag article provided basically the only significant written third-party acknowledgment of Annie's claims, I will say that I prefer the (hopefully, more) objective, straight-from-the-source, uncertainty-acknowledging approach I've taken here.

The key thing here is that, currently, the primary information we have is:

 1. Claims that Annie has made on social media, as well as a few pictures of her from when she was sick that she took, and a few screenshots of her social media that potentially indicate, but do not provably or definitively, indicate that she experienced shadowbanning, let alone that the low engagement/shadowbanning occured because of Sam.

As I note in my response to "Objection 4", Annie has provided no direct evidence to corroborate her claims, to the best of my knowledge.&nbsp;

I also acknowledge that the links I provided (e.g. from saprea.org) do not meet rigorous standards that would enable me to label them as "scientific" or "empiric" evidence to corroborate Annie's account. I provide them merely as a way of noting that the symptoms that Annie's reported seem plausible.

As I mentioned, the intent of this post is to promote discussion about the claims that Annie has made, and to spread awareness of the fact that Sam has not yet responded to Annie's (very serious claims.) This post does not claim that Annie's claims are provably or indisputably valid. In fact, I think the opposite is true: her claims are not yet corroborated by direct evidence, and they certainly are disputable. I currently hold Sam Altman to be innocent, until proven guilty.&nbsp;

In spite of this, I still thought that this post was worth making, as a means of bringing attention to Annie's claims, which I think have a nonzero probability of being true in whole or in part.</p></div></span></p><div id="b39yT8g7p8f9yHpui"><p><span><div><p><span>3</span><span>tailcalled</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>This seems like a thing that, even if true, would not lead to any direct evidence?

Deviating a bit from your reply to the more general question of "What direct evidence could be provided (e.g. by Annie) to corroborate the claims Annie is making?" -- I do think that a potentially useful piece of evidence that could be provided to corroborate (some of) Annie's claims would be proof that:

Obviously pedophiles are much more likely to sexually assault children than teliophiles are, and from what I've heard pedophiles are more likely to have no particular preference (or only weak preferences) for whether their victims are male or female. But pedophilic child molesters tend to have strong preferences for children, which is in tension with Sam Altman being attracted to adult men.

Alternatively I've heard that some teliophiles molest children out of opportunism, but that seems somewhat counterintuitive to me (in order to see children as a sexual opportunity, wouldn't they need to be attracted to them?). It's less counterintuitive if we're talking about teens (sexual attractiveness to teliophiles tends to gradually increase due to age, rather than suddenly spiking up at the age of consent), but that doesn't square with Annie being four years old. I'm pretty sure this type of child molester tends to have a correspondence between their preference for adults's sex and their preference for children's sex, but I also think their preference for children's sex is weaker than their preference for adult's sex.

These explanations are all making reference to the perpetrator's sexuality, though of course in much more complex and nuanced ways than gay/straight/bi.</p></div></span></p></div></div><div id="GcGdpqhgrMiySch6J"><p><span><div><p><span>8</span><span>DanielFilan</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>[epistemic status: i know nothing]

I do acknowledge that this may not provide an entirely satisfactory explanation of why a 13-year-old Sam (purportedly) chose to sexually abuse a 4-year-old Annie Altman.

 1. I thought its users would probably understand the significance of a claim that Sam Altman has been quietly hiding the fact that he sexually assaulted his 4-year-old sister.
 2. I thought that its users would be good at calling me out on any logical/irrational bullshit that I (unintentionally) propagated. I want to be right, not to feel right. Say what you will about LessWrong, but its users do love to be quite exacting in their arguments about whether or not they think a person is making rational arguments. Indeed, I've modified this post, and my replies, many times in response to comments I've received in a way that I think has been to the benefit of the clarity of this post and its conveyance of my position. I'm glad that my karma score has jumped all over the place as I've updated my post - it means that LessWrong users are actually thinking critically about the degree to which I am being rational.&nbsp;

It seems to me, at this point, one of two things is true:

 1. Annie Altman is lying left, right,. and center, or is deluded, disconnected from reality, or just misinformed/misunderstanding things to the point that she believes she is telling the truth when she is not.
 2. She is not lying (at least, to some degree.)

We can debate whether Sam Altman's alleged offenses are relevant to this forum, but I don't think there's any case to be made that his sister's mental health or honesty is relevant to anyone here. In which case the question isn't "is Annie lying?", it's "what did Sam Altman do? is it a pattern" and perhaps "is there any additional context we should know?"[1].&nbsp;

If this doesn't happen, it's probabilistic evidence against the worst tail scenarios of character traits, which would be helpful if we could significantly discount that.

It's frustrating that we may never know, but one way to think about this is "we'd at least want to find out the truth in the worlds where it's easy to find out."&nbsp;</p></div></span></p></div></div><div id="xpLLkJkreKKofnBxs"><p><span><div><p><span>-3</span><span>unparadoxed</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>Okay, thanks for the context. I appreciate the effort you've taken to collate information.&nbsp;

FWIW the information you have presented makes it seem like you are building a case against Sam Altman moreso than Annie herself is. And looking at the information without consideration for the identities of the alleged perpetrator and victim, I would conclude that the allegations are more likely non-credible than not. (I can elaborate further on why I think so).</p></div></span></p><div id="RayXvGQdJ62sK7sxT"><p><span><div><p><span>1</span><span>pl5015</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;

Actually, right now, I believe that, based upon the information I currently have, it is improper for me to conclude that Sam Altman abused Annie Altman, and that the proper stance is I do not know if Annie Altman's claims are correct or not; therefore, it is only rational to hold Sam Altman innocent.

However -- I'm in the process of gathering more information. Once I've conducted research to a degree I consider satisfactory, I'd be happy to hear your reasoning if, at that point, our conclusions disagree. For now, I'll suggest that you wait until I finish up my research, though feel free to ignore this suggestion if you want :)&nbsp;</p></div></span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="w9bKuLEfGpfApmDT6"><div><p>"I would like to note that this is my first post on LessWrong."

What could cause me to change my mind? Here are my cruxes.

If character assessment posts about particular people can be shown to cause a useful actions or ways of thinking for readers more often than they distract readers by unverifiable gossip.

If character assessment posts about particular people is used as a case study for reasoning about particular people to teach a broader lesson.

If character assessment posts about particular people allows community members to protect themselves from a real danger.

However, my beliefs are that these types of posts are juicy gossip that fuel idle speculation and status hierarchy games and serve no purpose except to make those who engage with content worse people who think more simplistically about human behavior and motivation. Even though this particular post is done fairly well for what it is, I think it is "bad form" and, perhaps, on the wrong site.</p></div></span></p><div id="AzseGSZ6pzwEJ5zqm"><p><span><div><p><span>4</span><span>Adam Zerner</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>It makes me happy to see such a cruxy comment like this. Thanks.

The cruxes seem reasonable. However, I feel like it's appropriate to upvote/downvote based on how confident you are on your position for each of them. Like, if it's really clear that a particular post will have the consequence of pushing people really far towards distracting gossip and away from useful actions, then downvote. If the opposite, maybe upvote. If it's unclear, probably do nothing.

Because this post is about the person who might be the most powerful person in the domain of AI, and thus is perhaps the most important person in the entire world, or even perhaps throughout history, I think it's actually a decently important topic. Because of magnitude, not probability. Like, even if there is a low probability that we figure out the truth, and of P(useful action | figure out truth), the magnitude of the positive impact could very well be large, and so it seems to me like a topic that is plausibly worth exploring. Enough that I upvoted it.

I think I personally have a tendency to see people like Sam Altman and Elon Musk and get caught up in thinking they're so awesome, and then am a victim of the halo effect. I find concrete examples of "wait, they frequently do things that aren't very awesome" helpful. I suspect the same is true for many others.</p></div></span></p></div></div><div id="F4Qoo7qQupEuaZNBW"><p><span><div><p><span>0</span><span>Adam Zerner</span><span>1mo</span></p><p>It makes things more difficult, but by wielding Bayescraft appropriately, discussion and updating can certainly still occur.

Mira Murati, the company‚Äôs chief technology officer, will serve as interim CEO, effective immediately.</p><p>A member of OpenAI‚Äôs leadership team for five years, Mira has played a critical role in OpenAI‚Äôs evolution into a global AI leader. She brings a unique skill set, understanding of the company‚Äôs values, operations, and business, and already leads the company‚Äôs research, product, and safety functions.&nbsp;Given her long tenure and close engagement with all aspects of the company, including her experience in AI governance and policy, the board believes she is uniquely qualified for the role and anticipates a seamless transition while it conducts a formal search for a permanent CEO.</p><p>Mr. Altman‚Äôs departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities. The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI.</p><p>In a statement, the board of directors said: ‚ÄúOpenAI was deliberately structured to advance our mission: to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all humanity. The board remains fully committed to serving this mission. We are grateful for Sam‚Äôs many contributions to the founding and growth of OpenAI. At the same time, we believe new leadership is necessary as we move forward. As the leader of the company‚Äôs research, product, and safety functions, Mira is exceptionally qualified to step into the role of interim CEO. We have the utmost confidence in her ability to lead OpenAI during this transition period.‚Äù</p><p>OpenAI‚Äôs board of directors consists of OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, independent directors Quora CEO Adam D‚ÄôAngelo, technology entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, and Georgetown Center for Security and Emerging Technology‚Äôs Helen Toner.</p><p>As a part of this transition,&nbsp;Greg Brockman will be stepping down as chairman of the board and will remain in his role at the company, reporting to the CEO.</p><p>OpenAI was founded as a non-profit in 2015 with the core mission of ensuring that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. In 2019, OpenAI restructured to ensure that the company could raise capital in pursuit of this mission, while preserving the nonprofit's mission, governance, and oversight. The majority of the board is independent, and the independent directors do not hold equity in OpenAI. While the company has experienced dramatic growth, it remains the fundamental governance responsibility of the board to advance OpenAI‚Äôs mission and preserve the principles of its Charter.<br></p></div></div>]]></description>

As this was many people's first experience with Half-Life, we thought it was finally time to bundle it with the main game‚Äîno sound card purchase necessary.</p>

                            <p>Built by Valve level designers, these new maps push the limits of what's possible in the Half-Life engine.</p>

                                    <p>Two-foot-thick steel doors block off access to this contaminated waste facility, which has questionable scientific goals at best. Strap on a gluon gun and roast all intruders.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>At the Malmo port in southern Sweden, a cargo ship looms over row after row of shiny new cars ‚Äî Volkswagens, Volvos, Mercedes.</p><p>Notably missing are Teslas. That's because dockworkers are refusing to unload them.</p><p>Goran Larsson, a cargo ship inspector, said he's informing the crew on each arriving vessel of the labor action and assessing whether any Teslas are on board.</p><p>"We want there to be good regulation in Sweden ‚Äî law and order all around the workplaces," Larsson said. "And this is the first step that we will do."</p><p>Tesla has long fended off efforts to unionize its workforce around the world. But in Sweden, the electric vehicle maker is facing its first formal labor action over its anti-union stance, with potential ripple effects for the company globally.</p><p>The Swedish metal and industrial workers union, IF Metall, which represents Tesla's roughly 120 workers, launched a walkout at the company in late October.</p><p>And now, Swedish workers of all stripes ‚Äì dockworkers, electricians, cleaners and others ‚Äì are banding together to boycott the U.S. company in solidarity.</p><p>The strike is a response to the company's refusal to sign a collective bargaining agreement for its employees, almost all of them mechanics, because Tesla doesn't have a manufacturing plant in Sweden.</p><h3>Even postal workers will stop delivering mail to Tesla</h3><p>About 90% of the entire Swedish workforce belong to trade unions and they are covered by contracts with their employers, which standardize pay rates, insurance and pensions, among other work conditions, in each sector.</p>
      <hr><p>
      Related Story: <a href="https://text.npr.org/1209109868">Why workers are resorting to more strikes this year to pressure companies </a></p><hr><p>"This is the way we regulate working conditions in Sweden and has been for a long, long time," said IF Metall spokesperson Jesper Pettersson. "It has been very beneficial for both parties ‚Äì both for employers and for employees."</p><p>The Swedish labor movement is rallying behind the relatively small group of Tesla mechanics, who repair Tesla vehicles at service centers.</p><p>Thousands of workers are refusing to touch any Teslas until the company signs a contract. And the boycott keeps expanding. Postal workers have said they will stop delivering mail addressed to the company if there's no deal by Nov. 20.</p><h3>Trade unions are part of the fabric of the Swedish economy</h3><p>They see the American EV maker's efforts to circumvent collective bargaining as an affront to the entire Swedish labor system, where trade unions are part of the fabric of the economy.</p><p>Dockworkers represented by Sweden's transport workers' union have been blocking all imports of Teslas at Sweden's four main ports since last week. And this Friday, they're set to expand their blockade to the entire country.</p><p>Tommy Wreeth, chairman of the transport workers' union, said the Swedish labor system is based on collective bargaining agreements, which Tesla, led by the staunchly anti-union Elon Musk, is reluctant to embrace.</p>

      Related Story: <a href="https://text.npr.org/1198938942">Sky-high CEO pay is in focus as workers everywhere are demanding higher wages</a></p><hr><p>"It's very important to protect our model ‚Äì it's a fight for the model, not just for the Tesla workers," Wreeth said, referring to his union's solidarity boycott.</p><p>Tesla did not respond to NPR's requests for comment. A Tesla representative told Sweden's TT News Agency that the company is choosing not to enter into a collective agreement.</p><p>"We already offer equivalent or better agreements than those covered by collective bargaining and find no reason to sign any other agreement," Tesla told TT.</p><p>A Tesla mechanic in Gothenburg, who requested anonymity due to concern about retaliation by the company, said he thinks a union agreement would provide a financial safety net that "allows us as employees to be able to have security."</p><h3>"Symbolically important" fight</h3><p>Despite the broad nature of the protests lodged by the unions, they have an uphill battle on their hands. Sweden is a relatively small market for Tesla ‚Äì its fifth biggest in Europe this year. And Tesla doesn't manufacture any cars in the Nordic country, meaning it could theoretically decide to leave the country altogether.</p>
      <hr><p>
      Related Story: <a href="https://text.npr.org/1206209107">UAW members aren't all assembling cars. More and more are unionized grad students</a></p><hr><p>But German Bender, a labor market analyst at Stockholm think tank Arena Id√©, said it's unlikely Tesla will leave Sweden. And he doubts the Swedish unions will give up anytime soon ‚Äì their fight, he said, is "too symbolically important" to abandon.</p><p>"And it becomes more symbolically important the longer the strike goes on," Bender said.</p><h3>Europe's one Tesla factory in Germany also has a union drive</h3><p>The strike is, at its core, a domestic issue ‚Äì it's about a foreign company at odds with Sweden's labor norms and values.</p><p>But the labor action comes as unions in bigger markets are also challenging Tesla. Musk is facing, for instance, a union drive at its factory in Germany.</p><p>It is Tesla's only factory in Europe: the Berlin-Brandenburg Gigafactory, one of six such plants worldwide.</p><p>In the United States, the Texas-based automaker has so far thwarted all attempts to unionize its workforce. But the United Auto Workers union has set its sights on Tesla, after negotiating major deals with the Detroit Three automakers.</p><p>"If the Tesla workers in Sweden would manage to sign the first collective agreement ever with Tesla, I think that could have a symbolic importance in other markets," Bender said.</p><p>Atle Hoie, general secretary of IndustriALL Global Union which represents industrial workers around the world, said large-scale strikes like this one are rare in Sweden. He said the solidarity from Swedish unions across sectors, including from dockworkers, is a "big blow to Tesla" both within and beyond the Nordic country, sending the message that Tesla "is not immune to organizing."</p><p>Anders Gustafsson, a former dockworker who now works for the Swedish transport workers' union, said his union has received messages of support from unions in other countries, including in the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>"We hope that Tesla workers all around the world actually take that fight," Gustafsson said. "Somebody needs to be first."</p>

Entirely unique to Rocket, sentinels offer an automatic last line of defense against runtime errors by enabling any type that appears in a route to abort application launch under invalid conditions. For example, the <a href="https://api.rocket.rs/master/rocket/struct.State.html"><code>&amp;State&lt;T&gt;</code></a> guard in v0.5 is a <a href="https://api.rocket.rs/master/rocket/trait.Sentinel.html"><code>Sentinel</code></a> that aborts launch if the type <code>T</code> is not in managed state, thus preventing associated runtime errors.</p><p><a href="https://api.rocket.rs/master/rocket/trait.Sentinel.html"><code>Sentinel</code></a>s can be implemented outside of Rocket, too, and you should seek to do so whenever possible.

This will greatly improve our documentation, which currently calls out the attribute for each affected trait, as well as offer modest performance improvements.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/749"><strong>Typed Catchers</strong></a></p><p>Today's catchers cannot receive strictly typed error data. This results in workarounds where error data is queried for well-typedness at runtime. While it <em>has</em> been possible to implement a form of typed error catching prior, doing so necessitated limiting error data to <code>'static</code> values, as other Rust web frameworks do, a concession we're unwilling to make.</p><p>After much experimentation, we have an approach that is ergonomic to use, safe, and correct, all without the <code>'static</code> limitation. This will allow error catchers to "pattern match" against error types at compile-time. At runtime, Rocket will match emerging error types against the declared catchers and call the appropriate catcher with the fully-typed value.</p></li><li><p><strong>Short-Circuitable Request Processing</strong></p><p>Whether with success or failure, fairings and guards cannot presently terminate request processing early. The rationale for forbidding this functionality was that it would allow third-party crates and plugins to dictate responses without offering any recourse to the top-level application.</p><p>With the advent of typed catchers, however, we now have a mechanism by which a top-level application can intercept early responses via their type, resolving the prior concern. As such, in the next major release, fairings and guards will be able to respond to requests early, and catchers will be able to intercept those early responses at will.</p></li><li><p><strong>Associated Resources</strong></p><p>Often a set of routes will share a set requirements. For example, they may share a URI prefix, subset of guards, and some managed state. In today's Rocket, these common requirements must be repeatedly specified for each route. While this is by design (we <em>want</em> a route's requirements to be obvious), the repetition is arduous and potentially error prone.</p><p>In an upcoming major release, Rocket will introduce new mechanisms by which a set of routes can share an explicitly declared set of requirements. Their <em>explicit</em> and <em>declarative</em> nature results in requirements that are simultaneously obvious <em>and</em> declared once.</p><p>We're really excited about this upcoming change and will be announcing more in the near future.</p></li><li><p><strong>Performance Improvements</strong></p><p>Rocket appears to lag behind other Rust web frameworks in benchmarks. This is partly due to <a href="https://rocket.rs/guide/faq/#performance">poor benchmarking</a>, partly due to security-minded design decisions, and partially due to unexploited opportunities. In the next release, we'll be addressing the latter points. Specifically:</p><ul><li><p><em>Explore making work stealing optional.</em></p><p>Rocket currently defaults to using tokio's multithreaded, work-stealing scheduler. This avoids tail latency issues when faced with irregular and heterogeneous tasks at the expense of throughput due to higher bookkeeping costs associated with work stealing. Other Rust web frameworks instead opt to use tokio's single-threaded scheduler, which while theoretically suboptimal, may yield better performance results in practice, especially when benchmarking homogeneous workloads.</p><p>While we believe work-stealing schedulers are the right choice for the majority of applications desireing robust performance characteristics, we also believe the choice should be the user's. We'll seek to make this choice easier in the next release.</p></li><li><p><em>Reduce conversions from external to internal HTTP types.</em></p><p>Rocket revalidates and sometimes copies incoming HTTP request data. In Rocket v0.5, we began transitioning to a model where we revalidate security insensitive data in debug mode only, allowing for bugs to be caught and reported while reducing performance impacts in production. In the next release, we seek to extend this approach.</p></li></ul></li></ol><h3 id="thank-you">‚ù§Ô∏è Thank You<a href="#thank-you" title="perma link">#</a></h3><p>A very special thank you to <a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/commits?author=jebrosen">Jeb Rosen</a>, Rocket's maintainer from v0.4 to v0.5-rc.1, without whom Rocket v0.5 wouldn't exist.

(US Army/Sgt. 1st Class Marisol Walker)</p></div>
<p><span>WASHINGTON ‚Äî For the sixth year in a row, the Pentagon has failed its </span><a href="https://breakingdefense.com/tag/audit/"><span>annual audit</span></a><span>, while contending it made incremental, year-over-year progress.</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúAuditing the Department‚Äôs $3.8 trillion in assets and $4.0 trillion in liabilities is a massive undertaking‚Ä¶ but the improvements and changes we are making every day as a result of these audits positively affect every soldier, sailor, airman, marine, guardian, and DoD civilian,‚Äù Michael McCord, the Department of Defense (DoD) Under Secretary of Defense and Chief Financial Officer, wrote in a statement Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>The department unveiled its latest audit on Wednesday and, similar to<a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2022/11/not-the-progress-i-would-have-hoped-for-pentagon-fails-latest-financial-audit/"> last year‚Äôs</a>, it examined 29 standalone entities, from the Military Retirement Fund to different military agencies. Of those it gave only seven an ‚Äúunmodified opinion,‚Äù or clean audit, in which auditors determined their financial statements were presented fairly and that they adhered to accounting principles.</p>

<p><span>Only one audit, the Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund, received an ‚Äúqualified opinion‚Äù this year, meaning auditors determined there were misstatements, or potentially undetected misstatements, but those did not adversely influence the financial statements.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While there are still three outstanding audits not yet wrapped up, the DoD reported that the remaining 18 failed, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and National Security Agency.<br>
</span></p>

<p><span>‚ÄúWe are working hard to address audit findings as well as recommendations from the </span><span>Government Accountability Office,‚Äù McCord wrote. ‚ÄúThe components are making good progress resulting in meaningful benefits, but we must do more, and we cannot do this alone.‚Äù&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The department has now failed every audit since 2018, the year the first audit took place. The audit is conducted by the DoD‚Äôs Office of Inspector General along with an independent public accounting firm.<br>
</span></p>


<p><span> In 2020, then-Acting Comptroller Thomas Harker signaled that by 2027 the Pentagon could begin to pass its annual audit, an ascertain </span><span>McCord </span><a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2021/11/as-most-military-agencies-fail-annual-audit-comptroller-claims-steady-progress/"><span>previously stated </span></a><span>might not be viable.</span></p>
<p><span>While there is a lot of heavy lifting to do to get to a clean audit, McCord noted several steps forward this year and outlined additional ones that can be taken to help achieve a passing grade.</span></p>
<p><span>Those additional steps include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>An Oct. 13 memo from Dense Secretary Lloyd Austin to the service secretaries and principal staff assistants emphasizing and reinforcing expectations for supporting the DoD financial statement audits;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>More collaboration across DoD‚Äôs planners and programmers, the DoD financial management community, DoD leadership, the Office of Management and Budget, and Congress ‚Äúto ensure alignment of priorities and resources;‚Äù&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>A call for lawmakers to pass annual budgets on time and avoid continuing resolutions and shutdowns; and&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Asking defense contractors to pitch in by introducing ‚Äúinnovative, time-saving enterprise solutions,‚Äù and bringing their property into audit compliance.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The call for congressional help is a timely one, coming just hours after lawmakers agreed on a new continuing resolution that pushes the DoD‚Äôs budget battle to February next year ‚Äî a regular source of frustration for senior Pentagon officials.</p>

    <p>We hop in the car to get groceries or drop kids at school. But while the car is convenient, these short trips add up in terms of emissions, pollution and petrol cost.  </p>

<p>Close to half (44%) of all Australian commuter trips are by car ‚Äì&nbsp;and under 10km. Of Perth‚Äôs 4.2 million daily car trips, 2.8 are for distances of less than 2km.   </p>

<p>This is common in wealthier countries. In the United States, a staggering 60% of all car trips cover <a href="https://www.urbanismnext.org/resources/summary-of-travel-trends-2017-national-household-travel-survey">less than 10km</a>. </p>

<p>So what‚Äôs the best solution? You might think switching to an electric vehicle is the natural step. In fact, for short trips, an electric bike or moped might be better for you ‚Äì&nbsp;and for the planet. That‚Äôs because these forms of transport ‚Äì collectively known as electric micromobility ‚Äì are cheaper to buy and run. </p>

<p>But it‚Äôs more than that ‚Äì&nbsp;they are actually displacing <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-26/the-rise-of-the-electric-two-wheeler">four times as much demand for oil</a> as all the world‚Äôs electric cars at present, due to their staggering uptake in China and <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2023/9/16/2192859/-EVs-are-cutting-the-world-demand-for-oil-but-not-in-the-way-you-may-think">other nations</a> where mopeds are a common form of transport. </p>

<h2>How can that be?</h2>

<p>On the world‚Äôs roads last year, there were over 20 million electric vehicles and 1.3 million commercial EVs such as buses, delivery vans and trucks. </p>

<p>But these numbers of four or more wheel vehicles are wholly eclipsed by two- and three-wheelers. There were over 280 million electric mopeds, scooters, motorcycles and three-wheelers on the road last year. Their sheer popularity is already cutting demand for oil by a million barrels of oil a day ‚Äì&nbsp;about 1% of the world‚Äôs total oil demand, according to estimates by <a href="https://bnef.turtl.co/story/evo-2022/page/2/1">Bloomberg New Energy Finance</a>. </p>

<p>What about electric vehicles, you ask? After all, EVs have been heralded as a silver bullet for car emissions and air pollution in cities, as their tailpipe emissions are zero. If charged with renewable power, they get even greener. </p>

<p>But to see them as an inarguable good is an error. They are cleaner cars, but they are still cars, taking up space on the roads and requiring a lot of electricity to power them. Their batteries make them heavier than a traditional car, and draw heavily on the extraction of rare earth elements. While EVs are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/climate/electric-vehicles-environment.html">overall much greener</a> than internal combustion engine cars, battery manufacture can undermine <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00532.x">some of the gains</a>.</p>

<p>On the plus side, petrol cars cost about <a href="https://www.carsguide.com.au/ev/advice/do-electric-cars-actually-save-you-money-83060">A$0.14 per kilometre</a> in fuel, or about $1,820 in fuel annually for the <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/industry/tourism-and-transport/survey-motor-vehicle-use-australia/latest-release">average car doing 12,000km</a>. Maintenance averages at $910 a year, bringing the total to $2,730 for a petrol car.</p>

<p>By contrast, charging an EV would cost around $480 for that distance. Maintenance of $240 takes annual running costs to $720. So EVs are much cheaper to run. But they are expensive to buy.   </p>

<h2>What advantages do electric mopeds and bikes have?</h2>

<p>The electric transport revolution is a great chance to rethink how we move through our cities ‚Äì&nbsp;and whether we even need a car at all. </p>

<p>Cars, after all, often have only one occupant. You‚Äôre expending a lot of energy to transport yourself. </p>

<p>By contrast, electric mopeds and bikes use a lot less energy to transport one or two people. They‚Äôre also a lot cheaper to buy and run than electric cars. </p>

<p>If you commute on an e-bike 20km a day, five days a week, your charging cost would be about $20 ‚Äì annually. </p>

<p>In Australia, electric bikes are very rapidly going from a hobbyist pursuit to a serious mode of urban transport. Over 100,000 e-bikes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/08/its-also-just-fun-why-a-growing-number-of-australia-families-are-ditching-cars-for-e-bikes">were sold here</a> last year.</p>

<p>Of course, you‚Äôre unlikely to use electric mopeds or bikes to drive from Sydney to Melbourne. Their real value is in short-hop trips ‚Äì&nbsp;the school run, the milk and bread run or even the commute ‚Äì&nbsp;where they take roughly the same time or shorter than a car. </p>

<p>Smaller electric options like scooters and skateboards also offer a way to overcome the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile_(transportation)">last kilometre problem</a> which plagues public  transport systems. This, in short, is the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-16/study-working-near-public-transit-is-more-important-to-non-car-commuters-than-living-near-it">inconvenient distance</a> between your home and the station or bus stop. Being able to cover this distance fast can be a game-changer for public transport. </p>

<p>If taken up, electric micromobility can cut urban emissions. A study of e-scooter riders in the United Kingdom found <a href="https://www.voi.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/UCL-C_Emissions-Savings-Emissions-from-Shared-E-Scooters.pdf">these trips produced</a> up to 45% less carbon dioxide than alternatives. </p>

<p>US researchers estimate that if e-bike trips expanded to 11% of all vehicle trips, transport emissions <a href="https://www.itdp.org/2019/09/24/e-bikes-e-scooters-drivers-of-climate-action/">would fall by about 7%</a>. </p>

<p>As petrol prices increase and battery prices fall, the cheaper running costs of electric vehicles and even cheaper running costs of electric mopeds, bikes and scooters will keep eating away at the demand for oil. </p>

<p>Global oil demand is now <a href="https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/iea-forecasts-global-oil-demand-peaking-by-2028">projected to peak</a> in 2028 at 105.7 million barrels per day ‚Äì&nbsp;and then begin to fall, according to the International Energy Agency. </p>

<p>Electric vehicles will play a role in cutting oil demand. But it may well be that electric micromobility cuts demand faster, given how fast these cheaper, more plentiful options are being taken up. </p>

<h2>What does this mean for me?</h2>

<p>If you‚Äôre looking to go electric, it‚Äôs worth taking a close look at your transport needs. If you live in an outer suburb or regional towns, you may find the longer range and larger capacity of an electric car is better suited.</p>

<p>But for many people, it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôll have a range of options. You might have one electric vehicle for longer trips, or group trips, as well as an e-bike for the school run or groceries. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article> 
     <div> 
       <p> <img alt="" src="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/electric-vehicle-battery-prices-falling-f/800x450.png"></p> 
       <p> It wasn‚Äôt long ago rising demand and component shortages sparked concern that <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/batteries-the-greenflation-challenge-2.html">‚Äúgreenflation‚Äù would drive up prices</a> for the batteries used in electric vehicles. That‚Äôs subsiding as prices cool for battery metals, which could help make EVs more competitive with traditional cars more quickly.&nbsp;</p> 
        
       <p> Goldman Sachs Research now expects battery prices to fall to $99 per kilowatt hour (kWh) of storage capacity by 2025 ‚Äî a 40% decrease from 2022 (the previous forecast was for a 33% decline). Our analysts estimate that almost half of the decline will come from declining prices of <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/infographics/green-metals/index.html">EV raw materials</a> such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt. Battery pack prices are now expected to fall by an average of 11% per year from 2023 to 2030, writes Nikhil Bhandari, co-head of Goldman Sachs Research‚Äôs Asia-Pacific Natural Resources and Clean Energy Research, in the team‚Äôs report.</p> 
       <p> As battery prices fall, Goldman Sachs Research estimates the EV market could achieve cost parity, without subsidies, with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles around the middle of this decade on a total-cost-of-ownership basis.&nbsp;</p> 
        
       <div><p> ‚ÄúThe reduction in battery costs could lead to more competitive EV pricing, more extensive consumer adoption, and further growth in the total addressable markets for EVs and batteries,‚Äù says Bhandari.</p><p>  The EV market was initially driven by regulatory support around the world, but global EV penetration is starting to retreat from recent highs, a potential driver of which could be governments in Europe and China cutting back on subsidies.</p></div> 
        
       <p> Still, our analysts see the EV market transitioning to a new phase that is more heavily influenced by consumer adoption than government largesse as battery prices drop. The team‚Äôs base case estimate for global EV penetration jumps to 17% in 2025 from just 2% in 2020, and to 35% and 63% by 2030 and 2040, respectively. But its ‚Äúhyper adoption‚Äù scenario sees EVs accounting for 21% of total global vehicle sales by 2025, 47% by 2030, and 86% by 2040.&nbsp;</p> 
        
       <p> So far China is leading the way ‚Äî its EVs are more competitively priced against ICEs in its local market relative to Europe and the US. While EV sales there have been subsidized by Chinese EV producers, which are selling EVs at a loss, the Goldman Sachs Research expects this to eventually change in around the middle of the decade, when battery price declines and a scale-up in EV sales volumes lead to a significant reduction in EV costs. And whereas Chinese consumers are seeing more options of competitively priced EVs, carmakers in the US and Europe have so far focused on larger and more luxurious EV models.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
       <p> ‚ÄúWe believe the EV market in China could be the closest to a consumer-led EV adoption phase,‚Äù Bhandari says.</p> 
       <p> Our analysts also credit new battery technologies for their forecast of a more rapid decline in battery prices. The report highlights a handful of EV battery innovations that could be commercialized this decade, creating ‚Äúpockets of strength‚Äù along the battery value chain. These include novel anode materials featuring silicon that replace or blend with graphite and improve energy density. Bhandari also notes there are new battery structures such as those that increase the size of each battery cell (large cylindrical batteries) that help simplify the pack manufacturing process, ‚Äúleading to a meaningful savings of labor and machine time.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>

<h3>from the <i>gop-living-down-to-its-reputation</i> dept</h3>

<p>For decades, big ISPs like AT&amp;T have refused to upgrade low income and poor communities to fiber, despite billions in subsidies, regulatory favors, and tax breaks that were supposed to accomplish <em>precisely that</em>. Groups like the National Digital Inclusion Alliance (NDIA) have released studies on cities like <a href="https://www.digitalinclusion.org/blog/2017/03/10/atts-digital-redlining-of-cleveland/">Cleveland</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalinclusion.org/blog/2017/09/06/more-digital-redlining-att-deployment-and-poverty-in-detroit-and-toledo/">Detroit</a>, documenting how this discrimination lines up with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america">30s ‚Äúredlining‚Äù efforts</a>. </p>
<p>Section 60506 of the 2021 infrastructure bill dedicated $65 billion in new broadband subsidies. But it also tasked the FCC with creating rules that would prevent future broadband deployment discrimination. The FCC came in just under the wire for Congress‚Äô November 15 deadline, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-adopts-rules-prevent-eliminate-digital-discrimination">finally unveiling its full rules yesterday</a>. </p>
<p>I‚Äôve spent much of the last few weeks talking to consumer groups, activists, and telecom policy experts about the rules.</p>
<p>The general consensus is that it‚Äôs a hugely welcome and long overdue improvement, even though the FCC stubbornly refuses to name and shame ISPs with long histories of clear discrimination (wouldn‚Äôt want to upset <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2015/08/17/new-leaks-confirm-ats-position-as-nsas-favorite-telco-partner/">key domestic surveillance allies</a>), the complaint process isn‚Äôt transparent, and many are worried that this FCC, with its sketchy track record on consumer protection, won‚Äôt consistently enforce them.</p>
<p>FCC boss Jessica Rosenworcel <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-398477A2.pdf">had this to say about the new rules</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúThese rules are strong. When you consider Congress explicitly directed us to ‚Äúprevent‚Äù<br>and ‚Äúeliminate‚Äù digital discrimination of access, they had better be. But I would also argue that they are fair and reasonable.‚Äù</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, these rules are a welcome and long overdue admission by the government that minority and low income Americans have been systematically discriminated against when it comes to broadband deployment, something that‚Äôs documentable and indisputably true, despite industry denials. </p>
<p>Late last year you‚Äôll recall <a href="https://themarkup.org/still-loading/2022/10/19/dollars-to-megabits-you-may-be-paying-400-times-as-much-as-your-neighbor-for-internet-service">The Markup released a story</a> showing that not only do big ISPs systematically discriminate in deployment, they charge low income and minority customers more money for slower service than less diverse, more affluent neighborhoods. It‚Äôs not really a debate. </p>
<p>One thing consumer groups are happy about: the rules govern both ‚Äúdisparate treatment‚Äù (spotty broadband deployment caused by active, provable discrimination) and ‚Äúdisparate impact‚Äù (spotty broadband deployment that falls along discriminatory lines regardless of intent). Telecom execs don‚Äôt often put discriminatory intent in emails to staff, so proving discriminatory intent isn‚Äôt always possible. Other agencies like the NTIA had <a href="https://www.ntia.gov/press-release/2023/ntia-calls-strong-digital-discrimination-rules#:~:text=NTIA's%20filing%20urges%20the%20FCC,an%20ISP%20against%20a%20group.">advised the FCC adopt this broader approach</a>. </p>
<p>‚ÄúStrong rules are needed to identify and remedy unequal access to Internet service, no matter what the cause may be,‚Äù NTIA Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information Alan Davidson wrote<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;‚ÄúRules that combat these inequities will bring lasting relief for vulnerable communities that historically have been left behind online.‚Äù</p>
<p>Giant incumbent telecom monopolies with decades of discrimination under their belt are unsurprisingly upset. Key trade groups have already <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/industry-hints-at-possible-legal-challenges-to-fcc-s-digital-discrimination-rules?mc_cid=e3190e9f79&amp;mc_eid=eb527a594e">threatened to sue</a> over the rules, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/11/internet-providers-say-the-fcc-should-not-investigate-broadband-prices/">seem particularly chaffed</a> that the rules govern discrimination in broadband pricing. They insist the rules interfere with ‚Äúthe practical business choices and profit-related decisions that sustain a vibrant and dynamic free enterprise system.‚Äù</p>
<p>Here in reality, U.S. broadband is anything but a vibrant and dynamic free enterprise system. It‚Äôs a failed market, dominated by a handful of politically powerful regional mono/duopolies, who hoover up untold billions in taxpayer subsidies for networks they routinely fail to fully deploy. All protected by layers upon layers of state and federal corruption policymakers like to pretend doesn‚Äôt exist.</p>
<p>Enter the GOP, which was quick to hyperventilate about the rules at industry‚Äôs prompt. Senator Ted Cruz and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/11/14/fcc-commish-brendan-carr-takes-a-break-from-crying-about-tiktok-to-lie-about-his-agencys-plan-to-combat-racism-in-broadband-deployment/">FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr</a> were particularly incensed, and quickly got to work <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fcc-commissioner-blasts-bidens-digital-equity-plan-unlawful-power-grab">peppering the media with false claims</a> that the rules were a dystopian Biden administration attempt to <a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/gop-to-fcc-back-off-from-overbroad-digital-equity-rules">exert ‚Äúgovernment control over virtually all aspects of the Internet</a>,‚Äù despite it being a congressional mandate. </p>
<p>Recall, Republicans largely voted against the infrastructure bill, despite the fact that they <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/27/republicans-keep-taking-credit-for-billions-in-broadband-subsidies-only-made-possible-by-the-covid-relief-and-infrastructure-bills-they-vehemently-opposed/">still take credit for the numerous broadband projects it‚Äôs funding</a> among local constituents. </p>
<p>Again, I‚Äôm not particularly sure this FCC will consistently enforce the rules (assuming they survive industry legal challenge) or bring any meaningful penalties against big companies, since that‚Äôs never been the agency‚Äôs strong suit. And the FCC‚Äôs failure to name and shape specific ISPs or address very clear past discrimination is a bit feckless. Also, with FCC leadership shifting every election, it‚Äôs extremely unlikely that a Trump-run FCC would ever bother to enforce the rules. </p>
<p>At the same time, absolutely <strong>any</strong> effort to hold big telecom accountable for shitty behavior is treated by the GOP as if it‚Äôs some kind of dystopian hellscape of government overreach (though this is the same GOP that wants to abuse FCC authority to bully social media companies that moderate, however sloppily, the party‚Äôs race-baiting political propaganda). </p>
<p>Still, simply having the U.S. government overtly acknowledge a generation of discrimination in broadband deployment remains a big deal. It at least <strong>attempts</strong> to begin to rebalance the scales after generations of redlining and government apathy, something predatory regional monopolies and their loyal puppies in Congress clearly aren‚Äôt too keen on. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.volvotrucks.com/en-en/news-stories/press-releases/2023/jun/volvo-delivers-74-tonne-electric-truck.html">https://www.volvotrucks.com/en-en/news-stories/press-releases/2023/jun/volvo-delivers-74-tonne-electric-truck.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38302844">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-nc="Text">
      <p>More and more hauliers are now starting to invest in electric trucks, also for heavy transport. Mattson √Ökeri in Gothenburg, Sweden is one of them, and the company has now bought three heavy electric Volvo FH trucks from Volvo.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the past few weeks, testing has been ongoing on one of the trucks in container traffic in the port area of ‚Äã‚ÄãArendal in Gothenburg. The test is a so-called HCT (High-Capacity Transport) project. The truck with two trailers is 32 m long and can handle a gross combination weight of 74 tonnes.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe want to show that all-electric solutions also work in applications with high total weights and a high utilization rate. Together with Mattson √Ökeri, the Swedish Transport Administration and several other partners, we are now looking at how we can optimize the operation of the electric truck, including how charging should take place in the most efficient way,‚Äù explains Lena Larsson, project manager of the HCT project within Volvo's technology organization.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The electric truck being tested is a Volvo FH Electric 6X4 and is charged with green electricity at the two fast 180 kW chargers that Mattsson √Ökeri has installed in the company's depot in Arendal. In the long term, the truck will also run between Gothenburg and the city of Bor√•s, 70 km from Gothenburg.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>In operation 12 hours a day</b></p>
<p>‚ÄúDriving long and heavy loads using electricity works very well so far, and we can carry as much cargo as a diesel truck,‚Äù says Jan-Olof Mattsson, CEO of Mattson √Ökeri. ‚ÄúThe truck runs 12 hours a day, with a stop for charging when the driver takes a break. We charge with green electricity and thus get no CO2 emissions. Silent, electric operation also means a better working environment for the driver.‚Äù<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>Since Volvo Trucks started production of all-electric trucks in 2019, the company has sold nearly 5,000 electric trucks in 40 countries around the world. Volvo today offers the industry's widest product range with six electric models in series production that meet a broad range of needs for transport in and between cities. Globally, Volvo Trucks has set the target that half of all trucks sold are electric by 2030.</p></div>
<p><b>High-Capacity Transports</b><br>
High-Capacity Transports (HCT) means that the vehicle's length and/or gross weight is allowed to increase, which allows for a larger load to be transported per vehicle. HCT can be applied on all types of drivelines. The idea is that HCT will contribute to lower transport costs, reduced environmental impact, higher traffic safety, reduced road wear and lower maintenance costs. In Europe there are a number of ongoing and planned HCT projects. One example is Finland, where it is permitted to drive with 76 tonnes of total weight and 34,5m truck combinations on most roads. Another is Sweden, where it is allowed to drive 74 tonnes (BK4 road network) and test, with permission from authorities, truck combinations of up to 34,5m and 100 tonnes on a defined road network.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="content:encoded"><p>ChatGPT is a bullshit generator. To understand AI, we should think harder about bullshit</p>
<p>This post appears in a blog created in 2019 to focus on AI in Africa. Long before the release of ChatGPT, many wondered why AI would be relevant to Africans. But I‚Äôm writing in a week when US President Biden published an executive order on AI, and British PM Rishi Sunak listened enthusiastically to Elon Musk promising a magical AI future where nobody needs to work. When the richest man in the world talks up a storm with NATO leaders, Africa will get blown around in those political and economic winds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since my fieldwork in Africa, I‚Äôve learned to ask different questions about AI, and in recent months, I‚Äôve started to feel like the boy who questions the emperor‚Äôs new clothes. The problem I see, apparently not reported in coverage of Sunak‚Äôs AI Summit, is that AI <em>literally produces bullshit</em>. (Do I mean ‚Äúliterally‚Äù? My friends complain that I take everything literally, but I‚Äôm not a kleptomaniac).&nbsp;</p>
<p>MIT Professor of AI Rodney Brooks summarises the working principle of ChatGPT as ‚Äúit just makes up stuff that sounds good‚Äù. This is mathematically accurate, where ‚Äúsounds good‚Äù is an algorithm to imitate text found on the internet, while ‚Äúmakes up‚Äù is the basic randomness of relying on predictive text rather than logic or facts. Other leading researchers and professors of AI say the same things, with more technical detail, as in the famous ‚Äústochastic parrots‚Äù paper by Emily Bender, Timnit Gebru and their colleagues, or Murray Shanahan‚Äôs explanation of the text prediction principles (references below).</p>
<p>‚ÄúGodfather of AI‚Äù Geoff Hinton, in recent public talks, explains that one of the greatest risks is not that chatbots will become super-intelligent, but that they will generate text that is super-persuasive without being intelligent, in the manner of Donald Trump or Boris Johnson. In a world where evidence and logic are not respected in public debate, Hinton imagines that systems operating without evidence or logic could become our overlords by becoming superhumanly persuasive, imitating and supplanting the worst kinds of political leader.</p>
<p>If this isn‚Äôt about evidence or logic, what is the scientific principle involved? Quite simply, we are talking about bullshit. Philosopher Harry Frankfurt, in his classic text <em>On Bullshit</em>, explains that the bullshitter ‚Äúdoes not reject the authority of truth, as the liar does [‚Ä¶] He pays no attention to it at all.‚Äù This is exactly what senior AI researchers such as Brooks, Bender, Shanahan and Hinton are telling us, when they explain how ChatGPT works. The problem, as Frankfurt explains, is that ‚Äú[b]y virtue of this, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are.‚Äù (p. 61). At a time when a public enquiry is reporting the astonishing behaviour of our most senior leaders during the Covid pandemic, the British people wonder how we came to elect such such bullshitters to lead us. But as Frankfurt observes, ‚ÄúBullshit is unavoidable whenever circumstances require someone to talk without knowing what he is talking about‚Äù (p.63)</p>
<p>Perhaps this explains why the latest leader of the same government is so impressed by AI, and by billionaires promoting automated bullshit generators? But Frankfurt‚Äôs book is not the only classic text on bullshit. David Graeber‚Äôs famous analysis of <em>Bullshit Jobs</em> explains precisely why Elon Musk‚Äôs claim to the British PM is so revealing of the true nature of AI. Graeber revealed that over 30% of British workers believe their own job contributes nothing of any value to society. These are people who spend their lives writing pointless reports, relaying messages from one person to another, or listening to complaints they can do nothing about. Every part of their job could easily be done by ChatGPT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Graeber observes that aspects of university education prepare young people to expect little more from life, training them to submit to bureaucratic processes, while writing reams of text that few will ever read. In the kind of education that produces a Boris Johnson, verbal fluency and entertaining arguments may be rewarded more highly than close attention to the truth. As Graeber says, we train people for bullshit jobs by training them to generate bullshit. So is Elon Musk right, that nobody will have to work any more once AI is achieved? Perhaps so, if producing bullshit is the only kind of work we need - and you can see how the owner of (eX)Twitter might see the world that way.</p>
<p>AI systems like ChatGPT are trained with text from Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and other huge archives of bullshit, alongside plenty of actual facts (including Wikipedia and text ripped off from professional writers). But there is no algorithm in ChatGPT to check which parts are true. The output is literally bullshit, exactly as defined by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, and as we would expect from Graeber‚Äôs study of bullshit jobs. Just as Twitter encourages bullshitting politicians who don‚Äôt care whether what they say is true or false, the archives of what they have said can be used to train automatic bullshit generators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem isn‚Äôt AI. What we need to regulate is the bullshit. Perhaps the next British PM should convene a summit on bullshit, to figure out whose jobs are worthwhile, and which ones we could happily lose?</p>
<p>If you'd like to read more, my new book on <em>Designing Alternatives to AI,</em> to be published by MIT Press in 2024, is available as an <a href="https://moralcodes.pubpub.org/">online free preview</a>.<br>

By masquerading as legitimate music rightsholders, two men managed to extract over $23 million in revenue from YouTube's Content ID system. Both were arrested and sentenced to prison. In the wake of the criminal proceeding, hundreds of disadvantaged artists came forward, and the court has now ordered the scammers to pay $3.3 million in restitution.

<p>YouTube‚Äôs flagship anti-piracy system is supposed to protect rightsholders but, in this case, it was used to exploit them.</p>
<h2>Multi-Million Dollar Scam</h2>
<p>The scammers‚Äô company, MediaMuv LLC., wasn‚Äôt a direct member of the Content ID program. Instead, it operated through a trusted third-party company, which had access to the platform.</p>
<p>By falsely claiming to own the rights to more than 50,000 copyrighted songs, the scammers generated more than $23 million in revenue.</p>
<p>In 2022, the first defendant confessed to his part in the copyright swindle by pleading guilty. Webster Fernandez admitted it was a simple scheme: find Latin music that wasn‚Äôt yet monetized on YouTube and claim the content as their own.</p>
<p>In February of this year, the second defendant pleaded guilty. Jose Teran signed a plea agreement admitting that he was part of the conspiracy, engaging in wire fraud and money laundering.</p>
<h2>Prison Sentences</h2>
<p>The guilty pleas may have helped to reduce their sentences but the defendants didn‚Äôt get off easily. This summer, a federal court in Arizona handed a <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/court-sentences-youtube-content-id-scammer-to-over-five-years-in-prison-230629/">70 month prison term</a> to Mr. Teran, to be followed by three years of probation. </p>
<p>A few weeks later, the same court sentenced Mr. Fernandez to <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/lead-youtube-content-id-scammer-sentenced-to-46-months-230821/">46 months in prison</a> for his role in the conspiracy, to be followed by three years of supervised release.</p>
<p>In addition to the jail time, both convicts had to forfeit multiple possessions related to their crimes, including bank accounts, several pieces of real estate, and cars.</p>
<h2>$3.3 Million Restitution</h2>
<p>At the time of the sentencing, the authorities requested victims of the YouTube Content ID scam to come forward, as they are entitled to restitution. The MediaMuv operation mostly targeted Spanish language artists, who were not monetizing their content on YouTube yet. </p>
<p>Over the past several weeks, hundreds of these artists submitted their claims, ranging from a few dozen dollars, to well over $100,000. Some of these artists were represented by lawyers or their label and the RIAA submitted a claim on behalf of artists as well. </p>
<p>All told, the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office and defense attorneys agreed to a total restitution amount of more than $3.3 million, which is due immediately. </p>
<p>‚ÄúThe United States, counsel for Webster Batista, and counsel for Jose Teran, respectfully stipulate to the restitution amount of $3,365,352.85,‚Äù the stipulation reads.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlong with the other standard conditions concerning the repayment of restitution, the parties agree that Webster Batista and Jose Teran will be jointly and severally liable for the restitution, restitution is due immediately, and Batista and Teran be ordered to make minimum monthly payments..‚Äù </p>

<p>A quick tally shows that roughly 800 affected artists came forward. One of the largest claims comes from Cecilia Ramirez, widow of the Mexican singer-songwriter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agust%C3%ADn_Ram%C3%ADrez_(singer)">Agust√≠n Ram√≠rez</a>, who was the frontman of the band Los Caminantes. Ram√≠rez passed away last year.</p>

<p>The RIAA‚Äôs claim totals $1,247,719.76 and is based on falsely claimed music of hundreds of artists, as detailed in this <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/webster-judg-c.pdf">57-page exhibit</a>. </p>
<p>Both convicted defendants are jointly and severally liable for the restitution payments. How long it will take to repay the affected artists will depend on their income and available funds. </p>
<p>A copy of the joint stipulation on the restitution amount is available <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/mediamuvrest.pdf">here (pdf)</a>. The amount was agreed upon by all parties and granted by the Arizona federal court earlier this week.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Replicate developer Charlie Holtz <a href="https://x.com/charliebholtz/status/1724815159590293764?s=20">combined</a> GPT-4 Vision (commonly called GPT-4V) and ElevenLabs voice cloning technology to create an unauthorized AI version of the famous naturalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough">David Attenborough</a> narrating Holtz's every move on camera. As of Thursday afternoon, the <a href="https://x.com/charliebholtz/status/1724815159590293764?s=20">X post</a> describing the stunt had garnered over 21,000 likes.</p>

<p>"Here we have a remarkable specimen of <em>Homo sapiens</em> distinguished by his silver circular spectacles and a mane of tousled curly locks," the false Attenborough says in the demo as Holtz looks on with a grin. "He's wearing what appears to be a blue fabric covering, which can only be assumed to be part of his mating display."</p>
<p>"Look closely at the subtle arch of his eyebrow," it continues, as if narrating a BBC wildlife documentary. "It's as if he's in the midst of an intricate ritual of curiosity or skepticism. The backdrop suggests a sheltered habitat, possibly a communal feeding area or watering hole."</p>
<figure>
    
    </figure>
<p>How does it work? Every five seconds, a Python script called "narrator" takes a photo from Holtz's webcam and feeds it to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/chatgpt-goes-multimodal-with-image-recognition-and-speech-synthesis/">GPT-4V</a>‚Äîthe version of OpenAI's language model that can process image inputs‚Äîvia an API, which has a special prompt to make it create text in the style of Attenborough's narrations. Then it feeds that text into an <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/">ElevenLabs</a> AI voice profile trained on audio samples of Attenborough's speech. Holtz provided <a href="https://github.com/cbh123/narrator">the code</a> (called "narrator") that pulls it all together on GitHub, and it requires API tokens for OpenAI and ElevenLabs that cost money to run.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>While some of these capabilities have been available separately for some time, developers have recently begun to experiment with combining these capabilities together thanks to API availability, which can create surprising demonstrations like this one.</p>
<p>During the demo video, when Holtz holds up a cup and takes a drink, the fake Attenborough narrator says, "Ah, in its natural environment, we observe the sophisticated <em>Homo sapiens</em> engaging in the critical ritual of hydration. This male individual has selected a small cylindrical container, likely filled with life-sustaining H<sub>2</sub>O, and is tilting it expertly towards his intake orifice. Such grace, such poise."</p>

<p>In a different demo <a href="https://x.com/skirano/status/1724944550790135926?s=20">posted on X</a> by Pietro Schirano, you can hear the cloned voice of Steve Jobs critiquing designs created in Figma, a design app. Schirano used a similar technique, with an image being streamed to GPT-4V via API (which was prompted to reply in the style of Jobs), then fed into an ElevenLabs clone of Jobs' voice.</p>
<p>We've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/james-earl-jones-signed-darth-vader-voice-rights-to-disney-for-ai-use/">previously</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/microsofts-new-ai-can-simulate-anyones-voice-with-3-seconds-of-audio/">covered</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-koe-recast-you-can-change-your-voice-as-easily-as-your-clothing/">voice cloning</a> technology, which is fraught with ethical and legal concerns where the software creates convincing deepfakes of a person's voice, making them "say" things the real person never said. This has legal implications regarding a celebrity's publicity rights, and it has already been used to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/rising-scams-use-ai-to-mimic-voices-of-loved-ones-in-financial-distress/">scam people</a> by faking the voices of loved ones seeking money. ElevenLabs' <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/terms">terms of service</a> prohibit people from making clones of other people's voices in a way that would violate "Intellectual Property Rights, publicity rights and Copyright," but it's a rule that can be difficult to enforce.</p>
<p>For now, while some people expressed deep discomfort from someone imitating Attenborough's voice without permission, many others seem bemused by the demo. "Okay, I'm going to get David Attenborough to narrate videos of my baby learning how to eat broccoli," <a href="https://x.com/JeremyNguyenPhD/status/1724837709158731887?s=20">quipped</a> Jeremy Nguyen in an X reply.</p>

<p>Google News is known to most people as a big pile of web links, but it actually hosts magazines, too. Before the days of the Internet, a "magazine" was a big bundle of paper full of articles you could get shipped to your door, sort of like if you printed out a website. For a time, you could pay cold, hard cash for a digital copy of a paper magazine through Google and then view that content through whatever the latest Google magazine/news app was.</p>
<p>Magazine content sales were shut down <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/01/03/google-news-killing-digital-magazines-refunds-subscriptions/">in 2020</a>, though, and soon, Google's magazine content will no longer be hosted online. The <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenews/thread/243673441/an-update-to-google-news-magazine-support">company announced</a> on a support page that purchased content will be shut down starting December 18. You can see if you have purchased (or freebie) magazines at <a href="https://news.google.com/my/magazines">this link</a>.</p>
<p>Let's see if we can put on our "Google archeology" hats and figure out where this all came from. Google started selling magazines in 2012 with "<a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2012/06/27/google-play-store-updated-to-bring-new-tv-shows-magazines-and-movies-for-purchase/">Google Play Magazines</a>." You could buy individual magazine issues for around $8 or subscribe yearly for $11. These were all hosted by Google, with access available through the app and web. One year later, in 2013, Play Magazines was merged with another Google news app, Google Currents, to create <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/11/google-launches-play-newsstand-a-hybrid-magazine-store-and-rss-reader/">Google Play Newsstand</a>. Newsstand featured paid magazines and free website content. Google spent 2013‚Äì2016 rolling out purchasing support across more and more countries.</p>                                            
                                                        
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/floorp_gdyDUPo63u.jpg" data-height="1011" data-width="1622" alt="A magazine on Google News."><img alt="A magazine on Google News." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/floorp_gdyDUPo63u-980x611.jpg" width="980" height="611"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/floorp_gdyDUPo63u.jpg" data-height="1011" data-width="1622">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> A magazine on Google News.</p><p>Google</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>By 2018, Play Newsstand <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/05/the-revamped-google-news-app-is-now-available-on-iphones-and-ipads/">was replaced</a> by the first "Google News" app, a long-overdue entry in the Google app portfolio given how much of a powerhouse Google News has been online. The new app focused more on online content but kept a spot for your magazine subscriptions. The Android Google News app still has the same package name from 2012: "com.google.android.apps.magazines."</p>
<p>With sales of new magazines dead in 2020, it was only a matter of time until Google shut down the hosting of old, purchased magazine content. The good news is that you can download a PDF of your purchased magazine before December 18. Anyone who has purchased magazine content should be getting an email with an option to download or, for some magazines, request a refund.</p>
<p>Google says that some magazines will be refund-eligible because they "contain interactive elements that cannot be downloaded and saved for future access." December 18 isn't just the date for the hosting shutdown, but also the deadline for downloads or refund requests.</p>
<p>Offering a PDF download is better than nothing, but static PDFs are a lot more cumbersome and miserable than the slick user experience Google's original magazine offering had across all your devices. Remember, all online content purchases are really just rentals.</p>

Ethernet has become the standard wired local area network around the world, and it is widely used in businesses and homes. It was honored this year as an <a href="https://ieeemilestones.ethw.org/Milestone-Proposal:Ethernet_Local_Area_Network_(LAN),_1973-1985" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Milestone</a>, a half century after it was born.</p><h2>Connecting PARC‚Äôs Alto computers</h2><p> Ethernet‚Äôs development began in 1973, when <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/thacker_1336106.cfm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Charles P. Thacker</a>‚Äîwho was working on the design of the Alto computer‚Äîenvisioned a network that would allow Altos to communicate with each other, as well as with laser printers and with PARC‚Äôs gateway to the <a href="https://ethw.org/ARPANET" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ARPANET</a>. PARC researcher <a href="https://ethw.org/Robert_M._Metcalfe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Robert M. Metcalfe</a>, an IEEE Fellow, took on the challenge of creating the technology. Metcalfe soon was joined by computer scientist <a href="https://ethw.org/David_Boggs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Boggs</a>.</p><p>Metcalfe and Boggs had two criteria: The network had to be fast enough to support their laser printer, and it had to connect hundreds of computers within the same building.</p><p>The Ethernet design was inspired by the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/alohanet-introduced-random-access-protocols-to-the-computing-world" target="_self">Additive Links On-line Hawaii Area network</a> (ALOHAnet), a radio-based system at the <a href="https://www.hawaii.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Hawai‚Äôi</a>. Computers transmitted packets, prefaced by the addresses of the recipients, over a shared channel as soon as they had information to send. If two messages collided, the computers that had sent them would wait a random interval and try again. </p><p>Metcalfe outlined his proposal, then called the Alto Aloha Network, in a <a href="https://ieeemilestones.ethw.org/w/images/a/af/Ref1_PARC_Ethernet_Memo_1973.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">now-famous memo</a> to his colleagues. Using coaxial cables rather than radio waves would allow faster transmission of data and limit interference. The cables also meant that users could join or exit the network without having to shut off the entire system, Metcalfe said in a 2004 <a href="https://ethw.org/Oral-History:Robert_Metcalfe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">oral history</a> conducted by the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/about/history-center/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE History Center</a>.</p><p>‚ÄúThere was something called a cable television tap, which allows one to tap into a coax without cutting it,‚Äù Metcalfe said. ‚ÄúTherefore, [Boggs and I] chose coax as our means of communication. In [the] memo, I described the principles of operation‚Äîvery distributed, no central control, a single piece of ‚Äòether.‚Äô‚Äù</p><p>Metcalfe and Boggs designed the first version of what is now known as Ethernet in 1973. It sent data at up to 2.94 megabits per second and was ‚Äúfast enough to feed the laser printer and easy to send through the coax,‚Äù Metcalfe told the IEEE History Center.</p><p>A 9.5-millimeter thick and stiff coaxial cable was laid in the middle of a hall in the PARC building. The 500-meter cable had 100 transceiver nodes attached to it with N connectors, known as vampire taps. Each of the taps‚Äîsmall boxes with a hard shell‚Äîhad two probes that ‚Äúbit‚Äù through the cable‚Äôs outer insulation to contact its copper core. Thus new nodes could be added while existing connections were live.</p><p>Each vampire tap had a D-type connector socket in it, consisting of a plug with nine pins that matched to a socket with nine jacks. The sockets allowed Alto computers, printers, and file servers to attach to the network.</p><p>To enable the devices to communicate, Metcalfe and Boggs created the first high-speed network interface card (NIC)‚Äîa circuit board that is connected to a computer‚Äôs motherboard. It included what is now known as an Ethernet port.</p><p>The researchers changed the name from the original Alto Aloha Network to Ethernet to make it clearer that the system could support any computer. It reflected a comment Thacker had made early on, that ‚Äúcoaxial cable is nothing but captive ether,‚Äù PARC researcher <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/kay_3972189.cfm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alan Kay</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/xerox-parc" target="_self">recalled</a>.</p><p>Metcalfe, Boggs, Thacker, and <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/lampson_1142421.cfm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Butler W. Lampson</a> were granted a U.S. patent in 1978 for their invention.</p><p>They continued to develop the technology and, in 1980, PARC released Ethernet that ran at 10 Mb/s. The update was done in collaboration with researchers at <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Intel</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Digital Equipment Corp.</a> (DEC) to create a version of Ethernet for broad industry use, according to the Milestone entry.</p><h2>Becoming an IEEE standard</h2><p>Ethernet became commercially available in 1980 and quickly grew into the industry LAN standard. To provide computer companies with a framework for the technology, in June 1983 Ethernet was adopted as a standard by the <a href="https://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/es-ecsg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE 802 Local Area Network Standards Committee</a>.</p><p>Currently, the <a href="https://www.ieee802.org/#:~:text=The%20IEEE%20802%20LAN%2FMAN,them%20on%20a%20global%20basis." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE 802</a> family consists of 67 published standards, with 49 projects under development. The committee works with standards agencies worldwide to publish certain IEEE 802 standards as international guidelines. </p><p>A plaque recognizing the technology is displayed outside the PARC facility. It reads:</p><p><em>Ethernet wired LAN was invented at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in 1973, inspired by the ALOHAnet packet radio network and the ARPANET. In 1980 Xerox, DEC, and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/intel">Intel</a> published a specification for 10 Mbps Ethernet over coaxial cable that became the IEEE 802.3-1985 Standard. Later augmented for higher speeds, and twisted-pair, optical, and wireless media, Ethernet became ubiquitous in home, commercial, industrial, and academic settings worldwide.</em></p><p>Administered by the IEEE History Center and <a href="https://www.ieeefoundation.org/donate_history" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supported by donors</a>, the Milestone program recognizes outstanding technical developments around the world.</p><p>The <a href="https://ieeescv.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Santa Clara Valley Section</a> sponsored the nomination.

  <div><p><span>Manifest V3, Google Chrome‚Äôs soon-to-be definitive basket of changes to the world of web browser extensions, has been framed by its authors as ‚Äúa step in the direction of privacy, security, and performance.‚Äù But we think these changes are a raw deal for users.&nbsp; </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/googles-plans-chrome-extensions-wont-really-help-security" title="We've said that"><span>We‚Äôve said that</span></a><span> since Manifest V3 was announced, and </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/am/deeplinks/2021/11/manifest-v3-open-web-politics-sheeps-clothing"><span>continue to say so</span></a><span> as its implementation is now imminent. Like </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea"><span>FLoC</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/08/dont-play-googles-privacy-sandbox-1"><span>Privacy Sandbox</span></a><span> before it, Manifest V3 is another example of the inherent conflict of interest that comes from Google controlling both the dominant web browser and one of the largest internet advertising networks.</span></p>
<p><span>Manifest V3, or Mv3 for short, is outright harmful to privacy efforts. It will restrict the capabilities of web extensions‚Äîespecially those that are designed to monitor, modify, and compute alongside the conversation your browser has with the websites you visit. Under the new specifications, extensions like these‚Äì like some privacy-protective tracker blockers‚Äì will have greatly reduced capabilities. Google‚Äôs efforts to limit that access is concerning, especially considering that </span><a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/biggest-tracker-networks/"><span>Google has trackers installed on 75% of the top one million websites</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>It‚Äôs also doubtful Mv3 will do much for security. Firefox maintains the largest extension market that‚Äôs not based on Chrome, and the company has said it will adopt Mv3 in the interest of cross-browser compatibility. Yet, at the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpDFS-GUytg&amp;t=416s"><span>2020 AdBlocker Dev Summit</span></a><span>, Firefox‚Äôs Add-On Operations Manager said about the extensions security review process: ‚ÄúFor malicious add-ons, we feel that for Firefox it has been at a manageable level....since the add-ons are mostly interested in grabbing bad data, they can still do that with the current webRequest API that is not blocking.‚Äù In plain English, this means that when a malicious extension sneaks through the security review process, it is usually interested in simply observing the conversation between your browser and whatever websites you visit. The malicious activity happens elsewhere, after the data has already been read. A more thorough review process could improve security, but Chrome hasn‚Äôt said they‚Äôll do that. Instead, their solution is to restrict capabilities for all extensions.</span></p>
<p><span>As for Chrome‚Äôs other justification for Mv3‚Äì performance‚Äì </span><a href="https://kevin.borgolte.me/files/pdf/www2020-privacy-extensions.pdf"><span>a 2020 study by researchers at Princeton and the University of Chicago revealed that privacy extensions</span></a><span>, the very ones that will be hindered by Mv3, actually improve browser performance. <br></span></p>
<p><span>The development specifications of web browser extensions may seem in the weeds, but the broader implications should matter to all internet citizens: it‚Äôs another step towards Google defining how we get to live online. Considering that Google has been </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/may/02/google-and-facebook-bring-in-one-fifth-of-global-ad-revenue"><span>the world‚Äôs largest advertising company</span></a><span> for years now, these new limitations are paternalistic and downright creepy.</span></p>
<p><span><a id="MV3quotes"></a>But don‚Äôt just take our words for it. Here are some thoughts from technologists, privacy advocates, and extension developers who share our concern over Manifest V3:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span>"A web browser is supposed to act on behalf of the user and respect the user's interests. Unfortunately, Chrome now has a track record as a Google agent, not a user agent. It is the only major web browser that lacks meaningful privacy protections by default, shoves users toward linking activity with a Google Account, and implements invasive new advertising capabilities. Google's latest changes will break Chrome privacy extensions, despite academic research demonstrating that no change is necessary. These user-hostile decisions are all directly attributable to Google's surveillance business model and enabled by its dominance of the desktop browser market." <br></span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><span>Jonathan Mayer, Princeton University</span></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><i><span>‚ÄúManifest V3 positions Chrome as the all-powerful arbiter of what software lives and what dies, shattering the ideal of a diverse array of extensions serving the legitimate preferences and values of equally diverse users. In 2017, when </span></i><a href="https://adnauseam.io/free-adnauseam.html"><i><span>Google banned AdNauseam</span></i></a><i><span> from the Chrome store, it summarily cut off tens of thousands of users from data they had accumulated, and deprived them of a free and open-source extension to counter online profiling and manipulation. In hindsight, AdNauseam was the canary in the coal mine, as Mv3 is now poised to cut off users from a range of invaluable privacy tools (including ad blockers) that thousands if not millions rely on. A browser that plays favorites to advance its owners‚Äô interests effectively chokes out innovative, independent developers, while shrinking the options for individuals to shape their online experiences.‚Äù</span></i></p>

We at Ghostery believe that Google's Manifest V3 harms privacy protecting extensions.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>Instead of requiring service workers and removing blocking webRequest, Google should make service workers and declarativeNetRequest optional, providing solutions fit for different use cases. Ultimately, this is about user choice and innovation.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>Instead of having to reinvent the wheel, we at Ghostery would like to focus on finding new ways to prevent tracking. This is after all what browser extensions are and should be, a playing field for innovation and the express lane for browser enhancement.</span><span>‚Äù</span></em></p>

Manifest V3 shrinks extension capabilities and Web users' freedom to customize their browsing experience.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>While there are many reasons to doubt the claimed privacy improvements and the theoretical performance gains, the disruption for existing extensions is painfully real: non-trivial extensions will need to be rewritten, in cases forced to abandon fundamental features.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>But even worse is the severe crunch on browser extensions developers' ability to innovate, and, in the case of privacy and security extensions, to respond to emerging threats promptly and creatively.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It‚Äôs 11:43pm on a Monday night. My 6-week-old son is asleep in my office so my wife can get some uninterrupted rest for the first half of the night. He‚Äôs finally asleep now, and I probably should be also after a full day of work. But I‚Äôm not done for the day. Even though I‚Äôm a software engineer by trade, I‚Äôm also a computer programmer by hobby and passion. So I do what I‚Äôve been doing for well over a decade now: I boot up my computer to write some code.</p><p>What to do, what to do‚Ä¶ Learn something new? Maybe. Write a blog post? Well‚Ä¶ here I am. But‚Ä¶ in the back of my mind I know that I have open source projects that need some attention. One happens to be heavily used. I‚Äôm nearly 3/4 million downloads, and it‚Äôs something that people seem to think has some level of usefullness. Those are the good parts. The bad parts are that there‚Äôs a dozen issues that I haven‚Äôt even reviewed much less triaged, investigated, and fixed. There are a few PRs from the community that I need to look through. There are dependencies that need to be updated. The list goes on and on. This project has hit a not-so-uncommon OSS milestone: Maintainer burnout.</p><h2 id="what-compels-all-software-builders">What compels all software builders</h2><p>I‚Äôm certainly not alone in my pursuits of writing software. And with the fear of overgeneralizing a massive group of us software craftspeople, I think the effort we put into software is a simple equation:</p><p><code>time = passion + money</code></p><p>Every hour we spend writing code is because of some combination of passion and money. Both of those can be zero, but the other part must be great enough to compensate the zeroed value. Let‚Äôs see me as an example:</p><p><img src="https://trstringer.com/images/oss-is-broken1.png" alt="Time and money"></p><p>My job as a software engineer is great. They give me money to write code. I‚Äôm also super lucky that I have a high level of passion for the code I write and the things I build. There‚Äôs also a high level of demand on my work. That‚Äôs a massive win! I‚Äôm lucky. Others may have low or no passion for their work, but their compensation keeps them coming back on Monday morning at 9am. That‚Äôs totally fine too!</p><p>Let‚Äôs see some of my other current projects. My blog, this blog, is one of them. I don‚Äôt get money, but I have a bit of passion with it and that matches the demand well enough. Then there is <code>passion project</code>, which I get no money from but I‚Äôm pretty stoked about so my motivation is pretty high. And there‚Äôs no demand, so I go at my own pace and take it whatever direction I want!</p><p>And then finally, there‚Äôs my <code>uninteresting (to me) OSS project</code>. What once resembled <code>passion project</code> is now unrecognizable from a motivation perspective. But the demand is high. There are lots of users, many in a corporate sense using my software to further progress their organization. And the bad news is, I get no money at all from it. So motivation is essentially nonexistent at this point. Where passion is falling short, money <em>could</em> motivate me to routinely work on this product.</p><h2 id="whats-really-going-on">What‚Äôs really going on?</h2><p>This all boils down to a situation where you have many profit-generating companies using software that some programmer volunteered to write. That software contributes to that company making even more money. But the developer sees none of it because they are just an author on some git commits, and aren‚Äôt on the company‚Äôs payroll.</p><p>This is Volunteering as a Service (VaaS). It is quite literally a free lunch at the expense of hard-working individuals.</p><p>That‚Äôs pretty dark, so let me bring that back a little bit. It is not all companies treating OSS this way. And even the ones that are, I would be willing to bet that 99% of these companies don‚Äôt neglect compensation out of malice. The OSS system is just entirely not equipped to facilitate these companies to pay contributors.</p><h2 id="whats-the-solution">What‚Äôs the solution?</h2><p>So that problem statement isn‚Äôt new. It has bounced around often and in many forms. So what do <em>I</em> think could be a solution? Open source software developers should have compensation that follows this:</p><p><code>money = contributions * usage</code></p><p>If you are an active contributor on a product with high utilization, the payout should reflect that. Likewise, if you‚Äôve submitted a couple of commits on a product that nobody uses, the money (or lack thereof) should represent that. But it‚Äôs not that simple, because there are different types of open source software developers out there. Some write OSS code as part of their employment, in which case they are likely already compensated for their contributions. It comes in their checks twice a month. But the other type of OSS developer is the one that is making those OSS contributors after hours and not affiliated with an organization.</p><p>OSS-using companies should be funding these projects. After all, they are using them. And even though they aren‚Äôt forced to buy licenses from SomeClosedSourceSoftwareCompany, that doesn‚Äôt mean that they <em>shouldn‚Äôt</em> be contributing.</p><h2 id="how-can-companies-contribute">How can companies contribute?</h2><p>The obvious answer is money. The less obvious answer is with developer time. This is quite common. Companies might have employees full or part time contributing to open source software projects. A great example of this is <a href="https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/9/companies-table?orgId=1">Kubernetes, and all the developers that contribute to Kubernetes on company time</a>. Those companies in that list (Google, Red Hat, VMware, and Microsoft to name the top ones) <em>are</em> contributing to the success of those projects. They‚Äôre giving developer time.</p><p>When a company doesn‚Äôt contribute any or enough developer time to the projects, they should be supplementing with money that is distributed to those OSS developers that <em>aren‚Äôt</em> representing their company. Enterprise compensation should resemble the following:</p><p><code>compensation = developers + money</code></p><p>Here‚Äôs another way to look at this:</p><p><img src="https://trstringer.com/images/oss-is-broken2.png" alt="OSS is broken"></p><p>All three of these companies are responsibly contributing to the OSS product, but in different ways. <code>company1</code> contributes both money and developer time, <code>company2</code> sends just money, and finally <code>company3</code> provides adequate developers to the project. <code>company3</code> is the Googles or Microsofts of Kubernetes.</p><h2 id="how-do-dependencies-get-compensated">How do dependencies get compensated?</h2><p>Quick, name all the dependencies of Kubernetes. You can‚Äôt, and I can‚Äôt either. There‚Äôs just too many. It shouldn‚Äôt be only end user facing products that get appropriate compensation. It should be these products that send a portion of their contributions (money and developer time) down to these dependencies in a big happy tree of contributions.</p><h2 id="why-is-this-so-hard">Why is this so hard?</h2><p>There is a lot of challenges to this. And these are only the things I <em>thought</em> of. I‚Äôm sure in reality it‚Äôs even more complicated. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt think the moral reponsibility at the moment falls on these companies. There needs to be a system in place that handles the contributions from users and distributes them to projects and dependency projects. It‚Äôs just too complicated to do otherwise. <code>company2</code> can wake up one day and say ‚ÄúI want to do the right thing and compensate OSS developers.‚Äù But‚Ä¶ uhhhh‚Ä¶ where do they send the money to? I have no clue. There is nobody to send it to without adding a <em>ton</em> of overhead, which isn‚Äôt fair to anybody. And no, I don‚Äôt think GitHub Sponsors is the answer to this.</p><h2 id="summarizing">Summarizing</h2><p>Hopefully one day we do figure out how to fairly compensate open source software builders. It‚Äôs the right thing to do, and I don‚Äôt know anybody (including these companies) that would argue that point. We‚Äôre all in this big software world together.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Renewables alone have powered the Uruguayan economy for nearly four straight months.</p>



<p>In the three months to end-September 2023, the South American nation generated all of its electricity from renewable sources ‚Äî with wind the single-biggest contributor, according to data from the country‚Äôs electricity market operator. And as of October 25, it‚Äôs on track to extend that streak by another month.</p>



<p>Uruguay hit the same milestone in 2022 during the spring months. But it had to turn back to fossil fuels ‚Äî in the form of imported oil ‚Äî over the summer period when a historic drought curbed hydro output. The polluting fuel accounted for roughly 10% of the power mix through 2022.</p>



<p><strong>How it got here:</strong>&nbsp;Uruguay used to rely almost entirely on hydro- and oil &amp; gas-based power. But as the economy grew and electricity demand threatened to overtake supply from the early 2010s, it needed to add additional generating capacity, and fast. New hydro wasn‚Äôt an option as it had already made the most of that resource.</p>



<p>To chart the way forward, the president appointed Ram√≥n M√©ndez Galain, a particle physicist from the private sector, as the country‚Äôs director of energy ‚Äî a position he held until 2015.</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/podcast/how-uruguay-went-almost-completely-fossil-fuel-free/">podcast discussion</a>&nbsp;with the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, M√©ndez Galain said one of his primary goals was to make Uruguay less reliant on volatile imported oil &amp; gas. The quest for energy independence made him rule out nuclear power, which would‚Äôve require uranium imports.</p>



<p>A decision was ultimately made to better exploit the country‚Äôs ample solar, wind, water and biomass waste resources.</p>



<p>Because the state couldn‚Äôt fund a massive energy programme alone, it ran a series of clean power auctions, where it offered project developers 20-year contracts to sell electricity into the national grid at guaranteed rates.</p>



<p>In just five years, $6 billion was invested in renewable energy ‚Äî the equivalent of 12% of Uruguay‚Äôs GDP.</p>



<p><strong>The results:</strong>&nbsp;Power production costs have declined ‚Äúby almost half‚Äù, according to M√©ndez Galain. And the clean energy sector has created 50,000 new jobs ‚Äî the equivalent of 3% of the labour force. Further, Uruguay has become a net exporter of electricity.</p>



<p>The rapid increase in wind power capacity has largely displaced oil use, even as electricity demand has steadily grown. Between 2017 and 2020, renewables made up 97% of the electricity mix and oil &amp; gas just 3%.</p>



<p>‚ÄúYou become independent of all these kinds of wars or other geopolitical events,‚Äù M√©ndez Galain said.</p>



<p>‚ÄúAsk me what was the impact on the electricity sector in Uruguay after this tragic war in Europe ‚Äî zero. We have no impact because we‚Äôre not dependent on energy commodities.‚Äù</p>
