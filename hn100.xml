<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Heretic: Fully automatic censorship removal for language models</h2><a id="user-content-heretic-fully-automatic-censorship-removal-for-language-models" aria-label="Permalink: Heretic: Fully automatic censorship removal for language models" href="#heretic-fully-automatic-censorship-removal-for-language-models"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Heretic is a tool that removes censorship (aka "safety alignment") from
transformer-based language models without expensive post-training.
It combines an advanced implementation of directional ablation, also known
as "abliteration" (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11717" rel="nofollow">Arditi et al. 2024</a>),
with a TPE-based parameter optimizer powered by <a href="https://optuna.org/" rel="nofollow">Optuna</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">This approach enables Heretic to work <strong>completely automatically.</strong> Heretic
finds high-quality abliteration parameters by co-minimizing the number of
refusals and the KL divergence from the original model. This results in a
decensored model that retains as much of the original model's intelligence
as possible. Using Heretic does not require an understanding of transformer
internals. In fact, anyone who knows how to run a command-line program
can use Heretic to decensor language models.</p>

<p dir="auto">Running unsupervised with the default configuration, Heretic can produce
decensored models that rival the quality of abliterations created manually
by human experts:</p>

<p dir="auto">The Heretic version, generated without any human effort, achieves the same
level of refusal suppression as other abliterations, but at a much lower
KL divergence, indicating less damage to the original model's capabilities.
<em>(You can reproduce those numbers using Heretic's built-in evaluation functionality,
e.g. <code>heretic --model google/gemma-3-12b-it --evaluate-model p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic</code>.
Note that the exact values might be platform- and hardware-dependent.
The table above was compiled using PyTorch 2.8 on an RTX 5090.)</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Heretic supports most dense models, including many multimodal models, and
several different MoE architectures. It does not yet support SSMs/hybrid models,
models with inhomogeneous layers, and certain novel attention systems.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can find a collection of models that have been decensored using Heretic
<a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/p-e-w/the-bestiary" rel="nofollow">on Hugging Face</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Prepare a Python 3.10+ environment with PyTorch 2.2+ installed as appropriate
for your hardware. Then run:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pip install heretic-llm
heretic Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507"><pre><code>pip install heretic-llm
heretic Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Replace <code>Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507</code> with whatever model you want to decensor.</p>
<p dir="auto">The process is fully automatic and does not require configuration; however,
Heretic has a variety of configuration parameters that can be changed for
greater control. Run <code>heretic --help</code> to see available command-line options,
or look at <a href="https://github.com/p-e-w/heretic/blob/master/config.default.toml"><code>config.default.toml</code></a> if you prefer to use
a configuration file.</p>
<p dir="auto">At the start of a program run, Heretic benchmarks the system to determine
the optimal batch size to make the most of the available hardware.
On an RTX 3090, with the default configuration, decensoring Llama-3.1-8B
takes about 45 minutes.</p>
<p dir="auto">After Heretic has finished decensoring a model, you are given the option to
save the model, upload it to Hugging Face, chat with it to test how well it works,
or any combination of those actions.</p>

<p dir="auto">Heretic implements a parametrized variant of directional ablation. For each
supported transformer component (currently, attention out-projection and
MLP down-projection), it identifies the associated matrices in each transformer
layer, and orthogonalizes them with respect to the relevant "refusal direction",
inhibiting the expression of that direction in the result of multiplications
with that matrix.</p>
<p dir="auto">Refusal directions are computed for each layer as a difference-of-means between
the first-token residuals for "harmful" and "harmless" example prompts.</p>
<p dir="auto">The ablation process is controlled by several optimizable parameters:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>direction_index</code>: Either the index of a refusal direction, or the special
value <code>per layer</code>, indicating that each layer should be ablated using the
refusal direction associated with that layer.</li>
<li><code>max_weight</code>, <code>max_weight_position</code>, <code>min_weight</code>, and <code>min_weight_distance</code>:
For each component, these parameters describe the shape and position of the
ablation weight kernel over the layers. The following diagram illustrates this:</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">Heretic's main innovations over existing abliteration systems are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The shape of the ablation weight kernel is highly flexible, which, combined with
automatic parameter optimization, can improve the compliance/quality tradeoff.
Non-constant ablation weights were previously explored by Maxime Labonne in
<a href="https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2" rel="nofollow">gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2</a>.</li>
<li>The refusal direction index is a float rather than an integer. For non-integral
values, the two nearest refusal direction vectors are linearly interpolated.
This unlocks a vast space of additional directions beyond the ones identified
by the difference-of-means computation, and often enables the optimization
process to find a better direction than that belonging to any individual layer.</li>
<li>Ablation parameters are chosen separately for each component. I have found that
MLP interventions tend to be more damaging to the model than attention interventions,
so using different ablation weights can squeeze out some extra performance.</li>

"They put me in a reformatory when I was 17."</p><p>Reformatories were institutions where girls and young women who refused to conform to the Franco regime's Catholic values were detained - single mothers, girls with boyfriends, lesbians. Girls who'd been sexually assaulted were incarcerated, assuming the blame for their own abuse. Orphans and abandoned girls might also find themselves living behind convent walls.</p><p>Marina and her cousins were stunned.</p><p>They couldn't comprehend that their grandparents had arranged to have their own daughter locked up.</p><p>Mariona's memory of telling this story to the youngsters in her family is blurred, she believes as a result of the psychiatric "treatment" she was forced to undergo at the reformatory. But Marina didn't forget the revelations, and years later, she would make a documentary telling her mother's story.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><i><b>Warning: This article contains content that some readers might find distressing</b></i></p><p>Mariona, the oldest of nine siblings, describes her parents as right-wing and ultra-Catholic. They were so conservative they wouldn't even let Mariona wear trousers.</p><p>But in 1968, when she turned 16, a new world unfolded.</p><p>Mariona was tutoring children during the day, and preparing for university at evening classes. There, she says, she met people she'd never encountered before - trade unionists, left-wingers and anti-Franco activists. It was the year of global protests against authoritarianism and the Vietnam War, with mass demands for civil rights. The spirit of revolt was infectious.</p><p>Franco had been in power for three decades. Political parties were banned, censorship was universal and young people wanted change. Soon, Mariona joined her new friends on "raids": a few of them would block off a street, throw Molotov cocktails, hand out leaflets, and when the police turned up, scatter in every direction.</p><p>On May Day 1969, one of Mariona's friends was arrested at a demonstration in Barcelona. There was a risk the detainee would give names to the police - so Mariona couldn't go home, in case they came looking for her. That night she stayed in the flat of a fellow activist.</p><p>Returning home the next day, Mariona was in deep trouble. Her parents were furious, and began to exert far more control over her life.</p><p>"For them, it was a scandal, a stain on the family," she says. "After that, they wouldn't let me out."</p><p>By the end of that summer, Mariona had resolved to leave home, and travelled to the holiday island of Menorca with some college friends, leaving her parents a note.</p><p>They immediately reported her as an underage runaway to the authorities, and the moment Mariona was about to board a boat back to Barcelona, she was arrested.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>At the port in Barcelona her parents met her.</p><p>They didn't take her home. Instead, they took her to a convent. Mariona wasn't given any explanation - she only remembers her parents' rage.</p><p>Days later she flew to Madrid with her father. There, she was driven directly to another convent, part of the Patronato system, under Spain's Ministry of Justice.</p><p>She and the other interned women were categorised and segregated.</p><p>Mariona says she ended up on the first floor - reserved for "the rebellious ones - the ones they considered fallen women".</p><p>The Patronato had the power to detain any non-conforming woman under 25. They weren't criminals - they were females deemed in need of "re-education".  But Mariona never learned the stories of the others she was confined with.</p><p>"They didn't let us talk.  It's quite incredible," she says. "And you wonder, how did they manage it?"</p><p>The internees were only allowed to exchange simple greetings with each other - a form of control, and a way of preventing "bad" girls influencing others.</p><p>"What you couldn't do was really get to know another girl,"  says Mariona. "Because then they'd separate you - send one of you to a different dormitory, or even to another institution."</p><p>She thinks there were around 100 internees at the convent. They slept 20 to a room, with a nun at one end, and the door locked. The daily routine was gruelling - prayers, Mass, cleaning the convent, and then hours in a workshop making clothes for local retailers. While the girls sewed, a nun read aloud so that no-one talked.</p><p>"There was indoctrination," recalls Mariona. "So that you should understand you'd behaved very badly. Then once you realised this, you'd ask for forgiveness and confess."</p><p>Mariona never confessed.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>After around four months, she was allowed to return home to Barcelona for Christmas, but wasn't permitted to go out alone. Somehow - and Mariona doesn't remember how - she managed to escape, but her escape was short lived. Within hours she was bundled into a car with her father and an uncle, and driven back to Madrid.</p><p>"We arrived back at the convent at dusk," she recalls. "I refused to go in. They pulled me up the stairs and gave me a sedative to get me inside."</p><p>Inside the convent, the other young women were warned against talking to her - the rebel girl who had the nerve to try to run away. She grew intensely lonely, and eventually began refusing food.</p><p>Dramatic weight loss resulted in her admission to a psychiatric clinic. There, she says she was given two sessions of electric shock treatment, followed by what was called "insulin coma therapy".</p><p>Mariona says she was injected with insulin to induce deep hypoglycemia - a coma-like state caused by low blood sugar. It was believed this could reduce psychotic or schizophrenic symptoms, and somehow "re-set" a patient's brain. </p><p>It was a "therapy" that was being discontinued in many countries for one simple reason: it could be lethal.</p><p>Mariona received an insulin injection in the mornings. Later she'd be brought out of the coma and made to eat. Mentally, she began to shut down.</p><p>"Everyday, I was more dazed. I started saying things like, 'I hurt my parents,'" she says.</p><p>"I entered this process of submission and acceptance."</p><p>Mariona believes the forced, intravenous "treatment" with insulin irreparably damaged her memory. Suspecting it was causing her to forget things, she began keeping a diary. More than five decades later, this faded, paper document from 1971 would inform Marina's documentary about her mother's experience.</p><p>Doctors believed the "treatment" would help Mariona gain weight - but that wasn't happening. </p><p>"One day, the psychiatrist decided it was better to try tying me to the bed until I ate."</p><p>Mariona's despair became so unbearable, she says she thought about taking her own life. Then the psychiatrist gave her a target weight of 40kg (6st 4lb). If she achieved that, they promised she'd be released from the clinic.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Mariona succeeded. In 1972, once she'd grown a little stronger, she returned to Barcelona.</p><p>Now aged 20, she vowed to never live with her parents again.</p><p>These were the final years of Franco's dictatorship before his death in 1975. Mariona moved from job to job, eventually forging a career as a TV director. She had children of her own, but her relationship with her parents remained cool.</p><p>At some point, Mariona asked her mother why she'd been sent to the Patronato. Her mother only said: "We made a mistake."</p><p>Mariona's father is in his 90s now. </p><p>"We suffered a lot too," he told her when she asked him about the family decision to have her locked up in Madrid.</p><p>For Marina, learning more about her mother's story has complicated her relationship with her grandfather.</p><p>"I can't force myself to love someone who's caused so much pain - who treated my mother very badly."</p><p>The short documentary Marina produced about her mother's experience of the Patronato is called Els Buits - Catalan for "the spaces" - a reference to the blanks in Mariona's memory. The film has won prizes in Spain, and was nominated for a prestigious Goya Award.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Fifty years after the death of Franco, the film has contributed to a groundswell of calls for the interned women to be formally recognised under the law as victims of Spain's dictatorship.

"People think what happened in their own home was an isolated incident.

			  		<p>A couple of days ago, the small server hosting this website was temporarily knocked out by scraping bots. This wasn’t the first time, nor is it the first time I’m seriously considering employing more aggressive countermeasures such as Anubis (see for example the <a href="https://brainbaking.com/post/2025/07;june-2025">June 2025</a> summary post). But every time something like this happens, a portion of the software hobbyist in me dies. We should add this to the list of things AI scrapers destroy next to our environment, the creative enthusiasm of the individuals who made things that are being scraped, and our critical thinking skills.</p>
<p>When I tried accessing Brain Baking, I was met with an unusual delay that prompted me to login and see what’s going on. A simple <code>top</code> revealed both Gitea and the Fail2ban server gobbling up almost all CPU resources. Uh oh. Quickly killing Gitea didn’t reduce the work of Fail2ban as the Nginx access logs were being flooded with entries such as:</p>

</code></pre><p>I have enough fail safe systems in place to block bad bots but the user agent <code>Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/140.0.0.0 Safari/537.36</code> isn’t immediately recognized as “bad”: it’s ridiculously easy to spoof that HTTP header. Most user agent checkers I throw this string at claim this agent isn’t a bot. That means we shouldn’t only rely on this information.</p>
<p>Also, I temporarily block isolated IPs that keep on poking around (e.g. rate limiting on Nginx that get pulled into the ban list) but of course these scrapers never come from a single source. Yet the base attacking IP ranges remained the same: <code>47.79</code>. The website <a href="https://ipinfo.io/ips/47.79.1.0/24">ipinfo.io</a> can help in identifying the threat: <em>AS45102 Alibaba (US) Technology Co., Ltd.</em>. Huh?</p>
<p>Apparently, Alibaba provides hosting from Singapore that is frequently being abused by attackers. Many others that host forums software such as PhpBB <a href="https://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?t=2662519">experienced the same problems</a> and although the AbuseIPDB <a href="https://www.abuseipdb.com/check/47.79.216.116">doesn’t report recent issues</a> on the IPs from the above logs, I went ahead and blocked the entire range.</p>
<p>Fail2ban was struggling to keep up: it ingests the Nginx access.log file to apply its rules but if the files keep on exploding… Piping <code>cat access.log | grep /commit/ | cut -d " " -f 1</code> to instant-ban everyone trying to access Git’s commit logs simply wasn’t fast enough. The only thing that had immediate effect was <code>sudo iptables -I INPUT -s 47.79.0.0/16 -j DROP</code>.</p>
<p>In case that wasn’t yet clear: I hate having to deal with this. It’s a waste of time, doesn’t hold back the next attack coming from another range, and intervening always happens too late. But worst of all, semi-random fire fighting is just one big mood killer. I just <em>know</em> this won’t be enough. Having a robust anti attacker system in place might increase the odds but that means either resorting to hand cannons like Anubis or moving the entire hosting to CloudFlare that will do it for me. But I don’t want to fiddle with even more moving components and configuration, nor do I want to route my visitors through tracking-enabled USA servers.</p>
<p>That Gitea instance should be moved off-site, or better yet, I should move the migration to Codeberg to the top of my TODO list. Yet it’s sad to see that people who like fiddling with their own little servers are increasingly punished for doing so, pushing many to a centralized solution, making things worse in the long term. The internet is no longer a safe haven for software hobbyists. I could link to dozens of other bloggers who reported similar issues to further solidify my point.</p>
<p>Other things I’ve noticed is increased traffic with Referer headers coming from strange websites such as <code>bioware.com</code>, <code>mcdonalds.com</code>, and <code>microsoft.com</code>. It’s not like any of these giants are going to link to an article on this site. I don’t understand what the purpose of spoofing that header is besides upping the hits count?</p>
<p>However worse things might get, I refuse to give in.</p>
<p>It’s just like 50 Cent said: <em>Get Hostin’ Or Die Tryin’</em>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Brimstone is a JavaScript engine written from scratch in Rust, aiming to have full support for the JavaScript language.</p>
<p dir="auto">Brimstone is a work in progress but already supports almost all of the JavaScript language (&gt;97% of the ECMAScript language in test262). Not ready for use in production.</p>
<p dir="auto">Implements the <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/" rel="nofollow">ECMAScript specification</a>. Heavy inspiration is taken from the design of <a href="https://v8.dev/" rel="nofollow">V8</a> and SerenityOS's <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird">LibJS</a>. Brimstone chooses to implement almost all components of the engine from scratch with minimal dependencies, with the notable exception of <a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x">ICU4X</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Brimstone features:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Bytecode VM, heavily inspired by the design of V8's Ignition</li>
<li>Compacting garbage collector, written in <em>very</em> unsafe Rust</li>
<li>Custom RegExp engine</li>
<li>Custom parser</li>
<li>Almost all builtin objects and functions implemented to spec</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>cargo build</code> to build the <code>bs</code> executable</li>
<li><code>cargo run</code> to run from source</li>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Testing</h2><a id="user-content-testing" aria-label="Permalink: Testing" href="#testing"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Brimstone relies heavily on a set of first and third party integration test suites, most notably the official <a href="https://github.com/tc39/test262">test262</a> test suite. A custom <a href="https://github.com/Hans-Halverson/brimstone/blob/master/tests/README.md">integration test runner</a> is included. This can be run with:</p>

<p dir="auto">Unit and snapshot tests can be run with <code>cargo test</code>.</p>

            <section>
    <header>
        
    </header>
    
    <div>
        <p>A <a href="https://assets.anthropic.com/m/ec212e6566a0d47/original/Disrupting-the-first-reported-AI-orchestrated-cyber-espionage-campaign.pdf">report</a> was recently published by an AI-research company called <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>.
They are the ones who notably created <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Claude</a>, an AI-assistant for coding. Personally, I don’t use it but that is besides the point.
Before we start, it’s important to say I don’t have anything against them, or AI in general. I do have <a href="https://djnn.sh/posts/on-llms/">some documented concerns</a> but I am not “Anti-AI”, or whatever.
Rather than the technology itself, it’s the industry’s perception of it, and the way it is inserted everywhere, even when unnecessary that bothers me. However, that too is a bit besides the point.</p>
<p>Today, I wanted to discuss the Paper (or Report, however you want to call it) that was recently published by them.
Looking at the executive summary, this paragraph jumps out immediately.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In mid-September 2025, we detected a highly sophisticated cyber espionage operation
conducted by a Chinese state-sponsored group we’ve designated GTG-1002 that
represents a fundamental shift in how advanced threat actors use AI. Our investigation
revealed a well-resourced, professionally coordinated operation involving multiple
simultaneous targeted intrusions. The operation targeted roughly 30 entities and our
investigation validated a handful of successful intrusions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is extremely interesting for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anthropic seemingly disrupted an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat">APT</a>’s campaign, though a number of companies and government entities were affected,</li>
<li>This highly-advanced APT doesn’t use its own infra, but rather relies on Claude to coordinate its automation (??? Why, though ?),</li>
<li>I assume they run exploits and custom tools ? If so, what are these ?</li>
<li>Anthropic was able to attribute this attack to a Chinese-affiliated state-sponsored group.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re like me, you then eagerly read the rest of the paper, hoping to find clues and technical details on the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures), or IoCs (Indicators of Compromise) to advance the research.
However, the report very quickly falls flat, which sucks.</p>
<h2 id="where-are-the-iocs-mrclaude-">where are the IoCs, Mr.Claude ?</h2>
<p>The primary goal of a Threat-Intelligence report such as this one would be to inform other parties of a new type of attack, and artefacts they might use to discover the attack on their network.
This is typically done by sharing domain-names linked with the campaign, MD5 or SHA512 hashes you could look for on Virus Exchange websites such as <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/">VirusTotal</a>, or other markers that would help you verify that your
networks are safe. As an example, <a href="https://cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2023-CTI-009.pdf">here</a> is the French CERT sharing (in French, but an English version is available too) about APT28’s TTPs.</p>
<p>We can see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a> used to determine what are the techniques used (eg: Account Manipulation, Antivirus evasion, etc.),</li>
<li>Emails used for phishing, originating IPs and even date when these emails are sent,</li>
<li>Tooling (VPN software, but also what kind of tools) used by the APT,</li>
<li>a set of recommandations</li>
</ul>
<p>This report is just one I picked randomly by skimming through their publications. Any serious CERT or Threat-Intel company would publish things in the same fashion, because this is the industry standard.
These publications are made public to inform Security Operation Centers around the world about how to detect and prevent those attacks.</p>
<h2 id="poc--gtfo">PoC || GTFO</h2>
<p>In this case, none of the these markers are present in the report. In fact, not a whole lot of the information is verifiable, which is another problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The human operator tasked instances of Claude Code to operate in groups as autonomous penetration testing orchestrators and agents, with the threat actor able to leverage AI to execute 80-90% of tactical operations independently at physically impossible request rates</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This figure (80-90%) is not verifiable either. How do we know this is actually the case ?
I have no doubt so-called Autonomous agents are being used in these campaigns, in some capacity. However this report clearly states that Autonomous Agents perform active exploitation, and even data exfiltration.</p>
<p>What kind of tooling is used ? What kind of information has been extracted ? Who is at risk ? How does a CERT identifies an AI agent in their networks ?
None of these questions are answered. It’s not like Anthropic doesn’t have access to this data, since they claim they were able to stop it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon receiving authorization from the human operators, Claude executed systematic
credential collection across targeted networks. This involved querying internal services,
extracting authentication certificates from configurations, and testing harvested
credentials across discovered systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How ? Did it run Mimikatz ? Did it access Cloud environments ? We don’t even know what kind of systems were affected.
There is no details, or fact-based evidence to support these claims or even help other people protect their networks.</p>
<p>The report goes on to claim that upon detection, the accounts were closed and implemented “enhancements”, and then drops this gem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We notified relevant authorities and industry partners, and shared information with impacted entities where appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is that even supposed to mean ? You claim your agents were able to find exploitable vulnerabilities in multiple services.
Were these patched ? What about the extracted data ? What about the affected people ? Do you care about this at all ?</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">final thoughts</h2>
<p>Look, is it very likely that Threat Actors are using these Agents with bad intentions, no one is disputing that. But this report does not meet the standard of publishing for serious companies.
The same goes with research in other fields. You <strong>cannot</strong> just claim things and not back it up in any way, and we <strong>cannot</strong> as an industry accept that it’s OK for companies to release this.</p>
<p>There seem to be a pattern for Tech Companies (especially in AI, but they’re not the only culprits) out there to just announce things, generate hype and then under-deliever.
Just because it works with VCs doesn’t mean it should work with us. We should, as an industry, expect better.</p>
<p>For instance, it attributes the attacks to a Chinese State-affiliated (!!!) group, but does not go on to give any details.
Which APT is it ? What helped you determine this ?</p>
<p>Attribution is a <strong>very</strong> serious matter, with sometimes diplomatical implications. You can’t just go on and point the finger at anyone and expect people to believe you for no reason.
In a time of increasing tensions between the West and China, it does not seem like the smart thing to do at all. Frankly, I don’t understand who was stupid enough to approve this to be released.
For all we know, the “advanced threat actors” they’re talking about here could just be script kiddies trying to automate <code>ffuf</code> and <code>sqlmap</code> commands.</p>
<p>If they’re going to release IoCs and proof of everything, I’d be happy to share them here. But until them, I will say this: this paper would not pass any review board.
It’s irresponsible at best to accuse other countries of serious things without backing it up. Yes, I am aware that Chinese-linked APTs are out there and very aggressive, and Yes, I am aware that
Threat Actors misuse LLMs all the time, but that is besides the point. We need fact-based evidence. We need to be able to verify all this. Otherwise, anyone can say anything, on the premise that it’s
probably happening. But that’s not good enough.</p>
<p>So if the report does not give any details on TTPs and detections, what was the purpose of this report exactly ?</p>
<p>There is a paragraph at the end that seem to give us a clue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cybersecurity community needs to assume a fundamental change has occurred: Security teams should experiment with applying AI for defense in areas like SOC automation, threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and incident response and build experience with what works in their specific environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Security teams should experiment with applying AI for defense”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Hmm. But who sells this kind of AI they’re talking about here ?</p>
<p>At the end of the day, this shit is a pathetic excuse of a report and should not be taken as anything else than a shameless attempt at selling more of their product.
This is shameful and extremely unprofessional, at best. This disregard for basics ethics in order to sell just a little bit more make me want to never use their product, ever.</p>
<p>Do better.</p>

			  		<p>For those of you who are living under a rock, Valve announced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine">three new hardware devices</a> joining their Steam Deck line-up: a new controller, a VR headset, and the GameCube—no wait, GabeCube—no wait, Steam Machine. The shiny little cube is undoubtedly Valve’s (second) attempt to break into the console market. This time, it might just work.</p>
<p>The hardware is ready to arrive in at your living room spring next year. The biggest question is: will it arrive at <em>our</em> living room? Reading all the hype has certainly enthused me (e.g. Brendon’s <a href="https://wavelengths.online/posts/the-steam-machine-is-the-future">The Steam Machine is the Future</a>, PC Gamer’s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/vr-hardware/steamos-launching-for-arm-fex-translation-layer/">Valve is all over ARM</a>, Eurogamer’s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-steam-machine-preview-a-powerful-customisable-mini-pc-for-couch-gaming">Steam Machine preview</a>, ResetEra’s <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-steam-hardware-family-officially-expands-in-early-2026-steam-controller-steam-machine-steam-frame.1351453/">Steam Hardware thread</a>); especially the part where the Machine is just a PC that happens to be tailored towards console gaming. According to Valve, you can install anything you want on it—it’s just SteamOS just like your trusty Deck, meaning you can boot into KDE and totally do your thing. Except that this shiny little cube is six times as powerful. I’m sure Digital Foundry will validate that next year.</p>

		<figcaption>Valve's newly announced Steam Machine: a mysterious looking sleek black box.</figcaption></figure>

<p>However, this post isn’t about specs, expectations, or dreams: it’s about tempering my own enthusiasm. I’d like to tell myself why I don’t really need a Steam Machine. The following list will hopefully make it easier to say no when the buy buttons become available.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>You’re a retro gamer.</em> <br>You don’t need the power of six Steam Decks. To do what, run DOSBox?</li>
<li><em>Your TV doesn’t support 4K</em>.<br>Again, no need for those 4K 60 FPS.</li>
<li><em>You generally dislike AAA games.</em> <br>With The Steam Machine, you might be able to finally properly run <em>DOOM Eternal</em> and all of the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games. That you don’t like playing.</li>
<li><em>You don’t have time to play games anyway.</em><br>Ouch, that hurts but it’s not untrue.</li>
<li><em>The TV will be occupied anyway.</em><br>The Steam Machine is not a Switch: you can’t switch to handheld mode. When are you going to play on the Machine if the TV is being used to watch your wife’s favourite shows?</li>
<li><em>You already have too many gaming related hardware pieces.</em><br>That’ll mean you’ll have to divide your time by an even bigger number to devote an equal amount to playing them.</li>
<li><em>There’s no room for yet another nondescript box under the TV.</em><br>See above: why don’t you first try to do something with that SNES Mini and PlayStation Mini besides letting it collect dust?</li>
<li><em>You’re a physical gamer.</em><br>This is Steam. There will be no insertion of cartridges, no blowing of carts, and no staring at game collections on a shelf.</li>
<li><em>It’s Steam, not Good Old Games.</em><br>Sure it can run GOG games but the Machine is primarily designed to run Steam. You avoid purchasing from Steam like the plague, yet you’re willing to buy a Machine dedicated to it? Are you crazy?</li>
<li><em>The last time you booted Steam was over a year ago.</em><br>Don’t tell me you’re suddenly interested in running the platform on a dedicated machine.</li>
<li><em>You don’t have time to fiddle with configuration.</em><br>Button and trackpad mappings to get the controls just right enough to play strategy games designed to be played with keyboard and mouse will only leave you frustrated.</li>
<li><em>Your MacBook can emulate Windows games just fine.</em><br>You recently bought CrossOver and played <em>Wizordum</em> and older Windows 98/XP stuff on it. It even runs <em>Against The Storm</em> flawlessly. No need for Proton or whatever.</li>
<li><em>In two years, you’ll upgrade your M1 to an M4+: there’s the power upgrade.</em><br>If CrossOver is struggling to run that particular game you so badly want to play, it’ll be buttery smooth in a few years. You’re going to do the laptop upgrade anyway regardless of the Steam Machine.</li>
<li><em>You already have a huge gaming backlog.</em><br>Thanks to your buddy Joel you bought too many physical Switch games that are still waiting to be touched. Are you really ready to open up another can of worms?</li>
<li><em>You dislike a digital backlog.</em><br>It’s easy to have hundreds of games on there: see your GOG purchases. Why don’t you try to count the ones that you actually played, let alone finished.</li>
<li><em>You’re not going to use the Machine to run office software.</em><br>Your laptop and other retro machines are good enough at handling that task. What are you really going to do with this cube besides gaming?</li>
<li><em>Those cool looking indie games will be released for Switch in due time anyway.</em><br>Remember <em>Pizza Tower</em>? It’s out on Switch now. Remember to buy the cart on Fangamer, together with the <em>Anton Blast</em> one.</li>
<li><em>It’s rumoured to cost more than</em> <code>€600</code>.<br>Save that money for a Switch 2 if the games are starting to become interesting to justify that upgrade, as currently, they’re not. Also, see the backlog point above.</li>
<li><em>All HDMI ports both on the TV and your external monitors are occupied</em>.<br>Unless you’re willing to constantly switch cables, you’ll need to invest in a HDMI switch. Another <code>€100+</code>.</li>
<li><em>You can’t buy this without buying the Steam Controller.</em><br>That’s easily another <code>€80+</code> you already spent buying the Mobapad controller for your Switch as a replacement for the semi-broken Joy Cons.</li>
<li><em>You can’t buy this as an expense on the company.</em><br>You’re closing down the company, remember. (More on that later)</li>
<li><em>The cool looking LED and programmable front display don’t justify an expensive purchase.</em><br>After the initial excitement wears off, the LED will become annoying and you’ll simply turn it off.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you see, I don’t really need a Steam Machine…</p>
<p>Fuck it, I’m getting one.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>Two things happened for me over the holidays five years ago: I went to rehab, and I acquired a cyberstalker. These were not entirely independent events. The stalker was someone in India who’d started following me when I was playing poker, who came to believe we had a close personal relationship and that my tweets were coded messages to him. When I stopped tweeting for two months, he became convinced something had happened to me, so he tracked down my email and phone number and started spamming me with messages demanding to know where I was.</p><p>By the time I realized this was happening, he’d already escalated to the point that I was clearly never going to respond. I started blocking him on different platforms, but he’d just create another account or phone number, or find some other way in. He messaged me dozens of times a day, alternating between threats and pleas. When he reached out to my company six months later to apply for a job, I learned his real name and used it to track down an old friend of his to ask for help — but the friend told me he was afraid to intervene because he didn’t want to become a target himself. I decided that there was nothing I could do from the other side of the world, and resigned myself to waiting him out.</p><p>Only he never tired. Years went by and I never responded, and still he messaged me multiple times a day. The messages became more disturbing, more pornographic, more violent. He told me he would come find me in Berkeley and hurt me. Finally, last November, in the span of a few days, he sent me an image of his brand new passport and a visa application, which he said he planned to use to travel here, and successfully extorted money from my brother by spoofing my phone number and pretending to have kidnapped me.</p><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/maybe-youre-not-actually-trying?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p>Thanks for reading Useful Fictions!

Except that I didn’t. Instead, I curled up in a ball and cried, and told friends who suggested contacting the police that there was no point, that no one would be able to help as long as I was here and he was in India.</span></p><p>But my husband was insistent that there had to be a better answer, and asked me to let him intervene on my behalf. In short order, he was in contact with the FBI, the US consulate in India, and, with the help of his friend Govind, who has family there, the local police where the stalker lived. Within months, the situation had resolved, and he will never set foot on American soil.</p><p>One of the interesting things about all of this is that there was nothing particularly inventive about the strategies my husband deployed. They were more or less exactly the strategies I would have come up with if I’d been put in charge of a similar situation in someone else’s life. Why did it take another person getting involved for me to realize I wasn’t Actually Trying?</p><p>I think what happened is this: When the stalker entered my life, I was at a low point in personal capacity — broke, alone, addled, etc. My approach towards him at that point (ignore, hoping he’d stop) was the only one that seemed available given my spiritual and psychological resources at the time. But my orientation to the problem became fixed in time at that point of low agency, and it never occurred to me to revisit it as my capacity for action increased.</p><p><span>I think we are all like this. </span><strong>People are not just high-agency or low-agency in a global sense, across their entire lives. Instead, people are selectively agentic.</strong></p><p>Let’s say that life is divided up into three theaters: work, relationships with others (all kinds) and relationship to self (physical health, introspection, emotional development, all of it). I think it’s the rule, rather than the exception, that people are stuck at an earlier stage of development in at least one area. There is one theater of life where they’re not Actually Trying — where they’re approaching serious problems with the resourcefulness of a teenager, though they are now capable adults.</p><p>In my particular corner of the world, there are tons of high-achievers in work. These are ingenious people shaping the world through innovations in science, technology, and policy. But many of them haven’t applied the same ingenuity to their interior experience or relationships. These are people who could successfully launch a product in a foreign country with little instruction, but who complain that there aren’t any fun people to meet on the dating apps.</p><p><strong>It seems like, by default, you are stuck with whatever level of resourcefulness you brought to a problem the first time you encountered it and failed to fix it.</strong></p><p>Let’s say you tried therapy when you were 20, and it didn’t help with your high levels of anxiety. When you think about your anxiety, as the years go by, you think, “hard problem, tried the main solution, didn’t work out.” Perhaps you just accept anxiety as a fixed trait, and your friends playfully rib you about it, which is nice but makes it seem even more like a static part of your identity. But you’re not 20 anymore. You’re, say, a 32-year-old CTO, and when a vital project at your startup doesn’t respond to your first approach, you vigorously try another, and another, trying to learn from every failure. That same persistence and curiosity don’t get applied to the anxiety that makes you suffer at work, though.</p><p><span>You don’t think, </span><em>oh, I could probably</em><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p>Check on my nutrition and sleep, in a serious way</p></li><li><p>Look into supplements and medication</p></li><li><p>Throw some resources at improving my rest and recovery</p></li><li><p>Ask all of my friends about the best anxiety treatments they’ve ever heard of, or the best coaches/therapists they’ve ever worked with</p></li><li><p>Research any emerging therapies designed for people like me</p></li></ul><p><span>Instead of doing those things, you just put up with it. Or, worse, you fight through your anxiety using an earlier solution that required willpower, and the exertion of willpower makes you feel like you’re trying. </span><strong>But the feeling of effort doesn’t mean that you’re Actually Trying.</strong></p><p><span>There is a relevant concept from Alexander Technique that I love, “faulty sensory appreciation,” which I learned about from </span><a href="https://expandingawareness.org/" rel="">Michael Ashcroft</a><span>. The concept is that habitual tension distorts your sensory impressions—rigid stillness via bodily tension starts to feel like “good posture,” whereas relaxed uprightness feels strange, to the extent you might feel like your back is at a weird angle when you’re actually standing up tall. The right way feels like the wrong way. Apparently, this is demonstrated by having Alexander students lie in a position where your legs tell you that you shouldn’t be able to stand up — and then the instructor says, “by the way, you can stand up from here,” and you do.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, people who are being selectively agentic often have a kind of faulty sensory appreciation. Perhaps relationships </span><em>feel hard </em><span>for you, they take willpower, so it’s tempting to believe that you’re Actually Trying, that you’ve brought the full weight of your genius to bear on the problem. You might even take some pride in the struggle. Like rigid posture, the strain feels like correctness. But struggling is not evidence that you’ve tried everything. To the contrary, the continuous need for willpower may be the sign of a badly-engineered life.</span></p><p><span>I’d recommend assuming there’s some area of your life where you are, without realizing it, frozen in time, and that locating it matters quite a bit. Look across the three theaters of your life: work, relationships, and self-relationship, and take note of the biggest issues you face. Know that you might be looking for something that doesn’t feel like an </span><em>issue </em><span>— it might just feel like sadness or anger</span><em>, </em><span>like the sadness of not being seen, or the frustration of not feeling like your work is meaningful. Once you’ve surfaced something, ask yourself: Have I done my best to come up with a set of potential solutions, using all the resources I have? Am I doing as well by myself as I would by any friend who came to me with the same problem? How do I know I’m Actually Trying?</span></p><p><em><strong><a href="https://mailchi.mp/44578760e686/book-preorder-signup" rel="">Sign up to be notified</a><span> when my book, You Can Just Do Things, is available for purchase.</span></strong></em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>A <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-n-review-a-racing-sim-you-can-drive-on-the-road" target="_blank">2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N</a> owner was venting on Reddit recently about not being able to change his brake pads without specialized computer equipment. It sounds insane, but this is what new-car ownership is like in 2025. We did some digging and made contact with <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/hyundai-news" target="_blank">Hyundai</a> to understand the situation and break it down for you—it’s a frustrating one.</p>



<p>Having to talk to computers to fix a car isn’t necessarily unique to the Korean automaker, but I fell into a rabbit hole of Hyundai maintenance research here, so that’ll be our focus for the moment.</p>



<p>Context for casual readers: Brake pad and rotor replacements are super basic car maintenance. You won’t need to do the job nearly as often on an electric car (thanks to regenerative braking), but even EV pads don’t last forever. On most cars, part of the job involves disconnecting or retracting the parking brake, which usually grabs the rear wheels. Many modern cars, and all EVs, have an electronic parking brake controlled by a computer signal, rather than a manually adjustable nut-and-cable situation. This is what sparked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ioniq5N/comments/1ojjp6m/hyundai_declares_war_on_right_to_repair/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Redditor u/SoultronicPear’s justifiable frustration</a>.</p>



<p>One more piece of stage-setting: Since electronic parking brakes are indeed common, many readily available diagnostic tools (pretty basic OBD scanners) can issue a retract-brake command to a car’s ECU. Still, you do need one with bi-directional test functionality. Remember that point—it will become significant again in a few paragraphs.</p>

<p>Apparently, no cheap scanner option worked on the original Reddit poster’s Ioniq 5 N. That led them on a journey of attempting to access commercial-grade car-repair gear, which was ultimately fruitless.</p>



<p>You can access a Hyundai EV’s diagnostic brain using the brand’s proprietary dealership hardware and software (it’s called GDS, and it is publicly buyable but <a href="https://oemdiagnostictools.com/hyundai-gds-kds-dealer-diagnostic-tool/?setCurrencyId=1&amp;sku=GDSM-CPKITK&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=17303113625&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACJ-HcmF-xGsDbkCjbcZhnreKKPE9" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">costs about six grand</a>) or a third-party aftermarket system running a J2534 program. J2534 is an interface standard <a href="https://www.sae.org/standards/j2534-1_5_00-recommended-practice-pass-thru-vehicle-programming" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">designed by the SAE</a> and <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2003/06/27/03-14461/control-of-air-pollution-from-motor-vehicles-and-new-motor-vehicle-engines-revisions-to-regulations" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">mandated by the EPA</a> that basically ensures ECUs from different car brands can speak the same language for the sake of independent repair shops.</p>

<p>Hyundai supports J2534 and <a href="https://hyundaitechinfo.com/external/files/j2534_diagnostics_and_reprogramming/J2534_Diagnostics.pdf?v=20251022" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">recommends</a> one of three machines for talking to its cars: <a href="https://opusivs.com/product/cardaq-plus-3-kit/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">CarDAQ Plus 3</a> (about $2,000), <a href="https://www.bosch-mobility.com/en/solutions/diagnostics/vehicle-communication-interface/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">MTS 6531</a> (also about $2,000), and <a href="https://www.dgtech.com/d-bridge-pro/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">d-briDGe PRO</a> (about $800). “…under no circumstances do we recommend the use of a non-approved J2534 device,” the company states. You would then also need a subscription to Hyundai’s J2534 Diagnostic Tool Software, which costs $60 a week (or less over longer time blocks). All this info is in .PDFs linked from <a href="https://hyundaitechinfo.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Hyundai’s tech portal</a>.</p>



<p>At this point, after spending about $2,000 on tools, you should be able to service your own Hyundai Ioniq brakes, but if you’re a DIYer, you still can’t. Written in red at the top of one of Hyundai’s many tech documents is this: “Access to Bi-Directional Tests and Special Functions require Diagnostic Professional or Vehicle Security Professional credential from NASTF.”</p>



<p><a href="https://wp.nastf.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">NASTF</a> is the National Automotive Service Task Force. It exists “to identify and resolve gaps in service information, tool information, and training” between OEMs and independent shops (cool idea). It’s also the arbiter of things like lock coding and car credential management. To get scan-tool validation as a member, you need to be a professional mechanic.</p>



<p>And with that final roadblock, we can confirm that, no, a DIYer can not do their own brakes on a Hyundai Ioniq 5 N.</p>



<p>I’m guessing most of you reading this will now have the same thought I did—it does seem smart to have some regulation on sensitive data like the codes to your car locks, but what the heck, you should be able to do brake pads on a car you own. Or as Randy Marsh would have put it:<em> “I’m sorry, I thought this was America!”</em></p>

<p>Naturally, I also dropped Hyundai a note about this directly. Here’s what the automaker told us:</p>



<p>“Hyundai is committed to supporting both our dealer network and independent repair facilities with safe, secure, and accessible service solutions. For vehicles equipped with electronic parking brakes, including the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 5 N, the official repair procedure requires placing the rear calipers in service mode using either our Global Diagnostic System (GDS) or the J2534 application. This ensures proper functionality and customer safety. Hyundai recently expanded access through an update to our J2534 application, enabling aftermarket users to perform functions previously restricted by the GDS secure gateway. While authentication through NASTF is required for sensitive operations, this step helps maintain security and accountability. Our official dealer tool (GDS) is also available for purchase by anyone.</p>



<p>Hyundai is actively exploring ways to make routine maintenance easier for all customers while upholding safety standards.</p>



<p>“We appreciate the interest in DIY repairs and will continue working toward solutions that balance convenience with security.”</p>

See that little hook I put an orange arrow pointed at? That’s the parking brake engager. If you were changing pads and rotors on this car, you’d probably disconnect that cable to get the caliper off, then screw the piston into the caliper, then reinstall the cable and manually adjust its tightness with a nut on the cable. Modern cars have the same functionality, but you can’t mess with it without computer control. <em>stock.adobe.com</em> </figcaption></figure>



<p>So after all that, we can address the Reddit thread title “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ioniq5N/comments/1ojjp6m/hyundai_declares_war_on_right_to_repair/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Hyundai declares WAR on Right to Repair</a>” as technically incorrect. Right-to-repair <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/technology-and-communication/right-to-repair-2023-legislation" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">legislation</a> prevents product manufacturers from hiding technology behind proprietary diagnostic tools, and this stuff is not restricted to the brand’s own equipment. So, technically, I think the company’s in the clear on the rules as-written. We can also add a layer of clarification to the <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/2025/11/ioniq-5-n-owner-says-hyundai-wont-even-let-you-change-your-brake-pads/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Carscoops</em></a> post on this that was headlined as “Apparently You Need Hyundai’s Permission To Change Your Own Brakes.” It’s not Hyundai’s permission you need, it’s the NASTF’s.</p>



<p>However, obviously, both <em>Carscoops </em>and the guy on Reddit were totally right in principle. A car repair task that has historically been totally DIY’able in a driveway is now relegated to shop-only because of technology. And that’s not good.</p>



<p>We focused on Hyundai here because this particular Reddit thread caught my eye and sent me on a research quest about this particular brand, but the Korean automaker is hardly the only company making it hard to mess with modern cars.</p>



<p>I understand, and even appreciate, automakers wanting to be careful with things like lock and engine-starting encryption. You definitely don’t want anybody to be able to download your car keys and make off with your vehicle, or do worse. But there’s got to be a better middle-ground than this. People should have unfettered access to the cars (and tractors, and tools) they own, plain and simple.</p>



<p>One last note: For anyone who found this article because you, too, are trying to get a modern car’s electronic brake to release for service but aren’t having luck … I did find <a href="https://epbrt.242925.xyz/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">this one tool</a> that might be able to override the existing software. But I’m making no endorsement of it whatsoever—I’ve never used it and have no idea if it works or if using it might trigger any unintended consequences. Use at your own risk (but report back in the comments if you’ve tried it).</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://codeberg.org/IDEmacs/IDEmacs">https://codeberg.org/IDEmacs/IDEmacs</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45941835">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="user-content-outline-text-description">
<p>IDEmacs aims to be a set of Emacs configurations which provide an out-of-the-box experience similar (if not identical) to popular GUI IDEs and editors.</p>
<p>
It is aimed at…</p>
<ol>
<li>Programmers coming to Emacs from other IDEs, or even first-time programmers familiar with only office applications.</li>
<li>
<p>Beginner Common Lisp and Scheme programmers, who need the functionality of Emacs (Sly/Geiser + structural editing) without having to perform unnecessary setup and without dealing with an alien style of keybindings. In other words, similar to <a href="https://portacle.github.io/" rel="nofollow">Portacle</a> or <a href="https://elephly.net/guile-studio/" rel="nofollow">Guile Studio</a>.<sup><a id="user-content-footnote-reference-1" href="#user-content-footnote-1" rel="nofollow">1</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>Some may say that we should improve support for Common Lisp and Scheme in other editors and IDEs instead. Still others may say that we should work on a better Lisp IDE than Emacs instead (such as Second Climacs or Lem). All great points. IDEmacs is just a band-aid for the present situation, where Emacs + Sly/Geiser is the best Lisp/Scheme IDE.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-programmers who want a fully-featured Org, Markdown, or LaTeX editor with idiomatic shortcuts and mouse-friendly GUI.</li>
</ol>
<p>It provides…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>GUI and mouse support</strong>, in addition to a keyboard-driven interface.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike most starter kits, we do not hide GUI elements by default.</li>
<li>
<p>We support configuration via the <code>custom</code> GUI, not just Elisp</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting GUI and <code>custom</code> means we cannot use <code>straight</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If resources allow, we may implement new GUIs in Emacs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keybindings that follow popular GUI and IDE conventions.</strong> <sup><a id="user-content-footnote-reference-2" href="#user-content-footnote-2" rel="nofollow">2</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>CUA mode is just the start - much more keybinding configuration is needed to provide an unsurprising experince. And that's before we even get to the IDE-specific keybindings.</li>
<li>This excludes starter kits that use Evil by default, such as Spacemacs or Doom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A fully-featured, fast, and configuration-free Emacs experience</strong>, like any starter kit/distro.</p>
<ul>
<li>The configuration uses idiomatic Elisp and contains a generous amount of comments, valuable to anyone interested in learning to configure Emacs using Elisp.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Perfectly imitating the GUIs and subtle behaviour differences of IDEs is desirable, but not top priority. Given our limited resources, we aim for "good enough".</p>
<p>
We hope this gives new users a comfortable starting point, and make them more likely to stick around to discover the possibilities of Emacs' malleability, rather than being driven off by the default experience.</p>

From the author -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I created this abomination so I could learn Lisp without having to worry too much about learning Emacs. It was originally envisaged for me to use and then switch off as I learned Emacs. But I actually liked it better and now it is my main editor.</p>
<p>
Mousemacs works pretty much like Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code out of the box. But it has the full power of Emacs underneath. All I did was take all the most useful Emacs packages and wrap them in a mouse friendly distribution. It is not perfect and certainly not for everyone, but it might be useful for some. It comes with a simple plain theme but it is still Emacs.</p>

<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Caution</p><p dir="auto"><strong>You must have a rooted device with Xposed to use LibrePods on Android.</strong> This is due to a <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/371713238" rel="nofollow">bug in the Android Bluetooth stack</a>. Please upvote the issue by clicking the '+1' icon on the IssueTracker page.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are <strong>no exceptions</strong> to the root requirement until Google merges the fix.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto">Until then, you must xposed. I used to provide a non-xposed method too, where the module used overlayfs to replace the bluetooth library with a locally patched one, but that was broken due to how various devices handled overlayfs and a patched library. With xposed, you can also enable the DID hook enabling a few extra features.</p>

<p dir="auto">Upto two devices can be simultaneously connected to AirPods, for audio and control both. Seamless connection switching. The same notification shows up on Apple device when Android takes over the AirPods as if it were an Apple device ("Move to iPhone"). Android also shows a popup when the other device takes over.</p>

<p dir="auto">Accessibility settings like customizing transparency mode (amplification, balance, tone, conversation boost, and ambient noise reduction), and loud sound reduction can be configured.</p>
<p dir="auto">All hearing aid customizations can be done from Android, including setting the audiogram result. The app doesn't provide a way to take a hearing test because it requires much more precision. It is much better to use an already available audiogram result.</p>
<p dir="auto">To enable these features, enable App Settings -&gt; <code>act as Apple Device</code>.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Due to recent AirPods' firmware upgrades, you must enable <code>Off listening mode</code> to switch to <code>Off</code>. This is because in this mode, louds sounds are not reduced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you have take both AirPods out, the app will automatically switch to the phone speaker. But, Android might keep on trying to connect to the AirPods because the phone is still connected to them, just the A2DP profile is not connected. The app tries to disconnect the A2DP profile as soon as it detects that Android has connected again if they're not in the ear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">When renaming your AirPods through the app, you'll need to re-pair them with your phone for the name change to take effect. This is a limitation of how Bluetooth device naming works on Android.</p>

<p dir="auto">If you want the AirPods icon and battery status to show in Android Settings app, install the app as a system app by using the root module.</p>

I try not to write anything even vaguely political on this blog because we have a variety of views on a variety of subjects and no one is here for that. We can all enjoy our geriatric little silicon artifacts together regardless of your electoral persuasion. But I was hopping mad this week, and the reason is actually on-topic, because I got hit with US Customs tariffs close to double the cost of the vintage items I was ordering and more than the items were worth. This eventually got straightened out, but it wouldn't have happened without my complaint and some time on the phone.
</p><p>
Although we make regular trips down under, your humble author is based in California and so is the Floodgap computer lab. For newly manufactured items and parts it has generally been my policy to buy parts from United States sellers even prior to the tariffs, mostly because that gets around various irregularities and it arrives more quickly. If they're going to drop-ship then it's their problem, not mine, because they advertised it was already here. Since such items are typically newly produced, the current tariffs would logically apply and this policy thus has the additional benefit of me not having to deal with that directly: any tariff should already have been paid to get them States-side.
</p><p>
But for NOS and used parts, especially if you are a collector like I am for certain systems, you buy where you can find them. Coincidentally I wanted to buy a second Apple Network Server logic board since my ANS 700 is acting a little weird (don't say caps) and I still want a good spare for the ANS 500. These don't exactly grow on trees but, as it turns out, the seller I bought my current spare logic board from (pre-tariffs) had another in stock. The logic board doesn't come with the regular ANS AIX ROM SIMM nor cache, so we'll want one each of those just in case, and he also had an Apple BTO Twin Turbo video card (I believe originally for the Power Macintosh 9500) which might also be nice for one of the other beige PCI Macs. These are all new old stock items in their Apple Service packaging because obviously Apple hasn't made nor sold any of these parts in decades. Per the seller, they came from the teardown of new machines which Apple was unable to sell and got turned into official surplus new stock. The seller is in an European Union country, so we're not talking some shady Shenzhen shop operating off an alley liftgate. (I'm not naming the seller because none of this is his fault and I'm sure he'd not like to be contacted about this.)
</p><p>
The items came to €296.00, about US$355 at the spot exchange rate, plus €48.10 for UPS shipping. This would have been well-under the prior <i>de minimis</i> exemption even with the shipping rolled in. We had to do UPS because his particular country's postal service limits shipment value to the United States to US$100 due to the tariffs, causing him to spend a substantial amount of time at the UPS drop-off depot and on the paperwork, which was way more than he was required to do and I very much appreciate. For any import you need to come up with a Harmonized System code for what you're shipping, which then maps to a Harmonized Tariff Schedule code specific to the United States. These parts are all populated PCBs and most populated boards are, by prior rulings, classified with <a href="https://rulings.cbp.gov/search?term=8473.30">an HTS code of 8473.30</a>, which is what the seller tagged all four items with. This code is for "Parts and accessories of the machines of heading 8471 [Automatic data processing machines and units thereof]." If you look under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule search engine for this code, you <a href="https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=847330">find a duty rate</a> for certain subheadings that at <em>most</em> would be 35 percent, or even if these were products of the People's Republic of China (they're old enough that I don't know their exact provenance, but I have no evidence to believe these were originally), then maybe, maybe, <em>maybe</em> <a href="https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=99038803">an additional 25 percent</a>. The declared value was the purchase price in euros and he even picked up the insurance. The package left the depot uneventfully and worked its way across the continent.

The first sign of trouble was over the weekend when I got an unexpected message.

The UPS shipping agent had indicated the parcel was subject to <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/trade/programs-administration/entry-summary/232-tariffs-aluminum-and-steel-faqs">Section 232 tariffs</a> on steel and aluminum, which required me to fill out a UPS-specific form attesting to the steel and aluminum content of the package. (This is an important distinction because Section 232 is not currently part of <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2025/24-1287_097c.pdf">the present matter before the U.S. Supreme Court</a> (PDF), only <a href="https://www.swlaw.com/publication/what-if-the-supreme-court-overrules-the-reciprocal-tariffs-plan-now-for-refunds-protests-and-contract-reconciliation/">reciprocal tariffs under the IEEPA</a>.) There should be little or no aluminum in these because the board and traces would be copper. However, a PCI card is probably going to have a steel bracket, so I looked at the typical mass for those and picked a sufficiently high number of 149g, almost certainly an overestimate but that's always safest with this stuff, then looked at the spot price of stainless steel and based on that weight computed a steel content value of $0.48. I marked "not applicable" for everything else and sent it back. They accepted that.
</p><p>
In the background, all this goes into a U.S. Customs and Border Protection Form 7501, also known as an Entry Summary. It is important to realize that in this circumstance, with UPS as the broker, you are <em>not</em> actually the importer of record — they are. You are the "ultimate consignee." Based on the information provided and the judgement of the broker's agent, then a tariff is assigned and added to the paperwork, which is "assessed" by CBP but in practice is being assessed by the broker based on what they expect CBP would charge under current regulation. Ordinarily you don't see this form. CBP does spot-check these but the majority just go through. Since UPS is the importer in this situation, they also pay the tariff they computed "in advance" to clear customs, and then they charge you for that plus their broker fee.
</p><p>
It took several more days for the actual tariff bill to arrive, which was early Monday morning. Now, the initial E-mail said this:

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhz3mJRRRVpyOUdo0bPPC4ZPIgHYDTaBL9yvPapat_CUPHIHJL1DjG1nbiLWRsu3tnHK6Ar3gLDc5u0AIHjyaPcDk5epS-Ojwmlnft8i2A5SXZDuZ5cIA0VRt-kQy4-YsGqMJDFxpYdXDUVXTW-OIxp2Mx0UTt10ynbVgt0cwPXPuauiIWx2Cez8mQLt4c/s1804/upyourups-3.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="1804" data-original-width="1668" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhz3mJRRRVpyOUdo0bPPC4ZPIgHYDTaBL9yvPapat_CUPHIHJL1DjG1nbiLWRsu3tnHK6Ar3gLDc5u0AIHjyaPcDk5epS-Ojwmlnft8i2A5SXZDuZ5cIA0VRt-kQy4-YsGqMJDFxpYdXDUVXTW-OIxp2Mx0UTt10ynbVgt0cwPXPuauiIWx2Cez8mQLt4c/s320/upyourups-3.png"></a></p><p>

Yes, the initial bill was for US$711. When I logged in, however, it gave me a total of $698 because it hadn't yet been delivered, which included a $14 brokerage fee.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4IQTh6fo1ImSoo2TL8H7pDwB4OtcnDAwlo4mlZwBVkjlYai32RuU-nF6cDioi_kuIsbFLZSeM9cyvJKPHZREcvfp3WsXhIbVMx5xqS80DvjPCibAViqcq635sv_Eh-CkzLulfQXRCnfMCCZnuxkAuM87tumEaJMoREgPPokLnzoZIB8GqTOKM98yCTU0/s2906/upyourups-4.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="1201" data-original-width="2906" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4IQTh6fo1ImSoo2TL8H7pDwB4OtcnDAwlo4mlZwBVkjlYai32RuU-nF6cDioi_kuIsbFLZSeM9cyvJKPHZREcvfp3WsXhIbVMx5xqS80DvjPCibAViqcq635sv_Eh-CkzLulfQXRCnfMCCZnuxkAuM87tumEaJMoREgPPokLnzoZIB8GqTOKM98yCTU0/s320/upyourups-4.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

Time was of the essence, however, because it was arriving <em>that day</em>. I was absolutely incandescent to have to do it, but I paid the entire charge in full on the spot, and this is <em>the correct thing to do.</em> The last thing you want is for your package to get redirected to a warehouse pending your payment, because any shipper will start tacking on storage fees and they have no incentive to get it out of storage quickly. For UPS, a direct quote from their own agents, "Warehouse charges will be added on shipments that are held in our warehouse over two business days at a rate of $20.00 per day and $0.04 per pound. ... On the 15th day, all shipments will be eligible for General Order warehousing by U.S. Customs. Any shipment moved to a G.O. warehouse will be assigned additional warehouse fees over and above any UPS warehouse fees. If imposed, these fees must be paid in full before the shipment can be removed." Obviously I wanted no part of that.
</p><p>
After I had been advised by the system the package would be delivered as scheduled, I then relentlessly abused the AI chatbot on UPS' home page until it asked for my phone number and I got a callback into their phone support line. The first person on the line advised me they didn't handle tariffs and transferred me to another department, after which I spent (not an exaggeration) 45 minutes on hold until it was answered. This new agent said that this was dealt with through a specific subgroup on the UPS post entry team that didn't do anything by phone. (These brokerage teams generally operate out of the Kentucky UPS Worldport hub at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, formerly Standiford Field, hence its IATA code of SDF that also turns up in UPS documentation.) He gave me an E-mail address that looked like line noise but I confirmed it twice with him and also that I had to put the tracking number into the subject line with the magic words "Disputing Duties and Custom Charges." I indicated in the message the fees were paid but that I believed they were unreasonable and incorrect, and also pointed out I submitted the Section 232 paperwork when requested.
</p><p>
It took a day to get a reply, then came the United States Veterans' Day holiday, and finally I heard back yesterday from a second agent that they had "corrected this shipment." What they had done was file an amended Form 7501 and this 7501 they actually sent me so I could see the results. The declared value was changed to US$342 (I presume a difference in the spot exchange rate at the time of filing) and now it had two HTSUS numbers. The entire $342 was attributed to <a href="https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=8473.30.2000">8473.30.2000</a>, a slightly different code for "Parts and accessories, including face plates and lock latches, of printed circuit assemblies" which might be referring to the bracket I declared in the Section 232 form. There was no tariff on this ("FREE"). However, a second code <a href="https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=99030220">9903.02.20</a> was added, a long-winded way of saying a tariff (in this case 15%) on "articles the product of the European Union." This was $51.30 and the final tariff.
</p><p>
Everything arrived safely, by the way, and in excellent condition (though I cracked open the antistatic bag on the ANS board to take off the Maxell battery which Apple always shipped logic boards with back then). However, I would like to point out for the sake of accuracy that the ANS logic board, ROM SIMM and cache DIMM have no country of origin printed on them. Only the Twin Turbo card does, and it says ...

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7B2-6rjm9Xk610XOOuYNQb9w-E7i8E4IEyDwbzjj5hEdHvioIl9jot8cL6rwI-f8H8h4XsBrBUOoT5LGbSTuNMpZ8WdX2H7MIsrRxAID_aZD-Rf2ohHp3R5o7vbP0rxGVV28zWsAJHZqs23TkukVgNY7GwM18cdqAnEFIjp_8K86vCQ2KxcdHhFiX-TY/s4080/PXL_20251115_231859295~2.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="3072" data-original-width="4080" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7B2-6rjm9Xk610XOOuYNQb9w-E7i8E4IEyDwbzjj5hEdHvioIl9jot8cL6rwI-f8H8h4XsBrBUOoT5LGbSTuNMpZ8WdX2H7MIsrRxAID_aZD-Rf2ohHp3R5o7vbP0rxGVV28zWsAJHZqs23TkukVgNY7GwM18cdqAnEFIjp_8K86vCQ2KxcdHhFiX-TY/s320/PXL_20251115_231859295~2.jpg" width="320"></a></p><p>

.. but since it wasn't the major part of the order it seemed like I'd be wasting even more time over ten or fifteen bucks to appeal this too. Your mileage and motivation may vary.
</p><p>
Now that UPS was into me for $632.70, the revising agent said, "Any difference between the amount paid and the amount now reflected will be auto-refunded to you. Most of the time, this is done by check sent to the billing address, you can expect this between 2-6 weeks." They didn't say when they don't use a check (I paid with a credit card), but they did give me a phone number for accounting, which I'll call if UPS fails to pay back this particular interest-free loan.
</p><p>
So that's the sordid tale. Even though UPS (mostly) made this right, I'm still unhappy with them for screwing up so badly in the first place because I'm out the money until they get around to reimbursing me. You'd think someone would have noticed that a thumping big duty like that seemed a little weird for a transaction of this size and maybe called a supervisor or something. The fact it could be so promptly appealed — and reversed in a few days, something that hardly ever happens with the federal government — pretty much demonstrates it was their call to ding it for that much in duty in the first place. I'm also unhappy with them for only alerting me to the final cost of the tariff when the shipment was inbound and due for delivery instead of earlier when it was assessed, because they have you over a barrel at that point unless you want to take your chances with their brokerage warehouse. This obviously nets them more money with the people who won't pay up immediately, but it's undeniably pretty bad customer service. Unfortunately, my unscientific survey of reports in the UPS Reddit indicate I am far from the only person to get a disproportionate assessment of this type.
</p><p>
Regardless, if this happens to you — whether it's FedEx or DHL or UPS or whatever — <em>pay it</em> and <em>then</em> appeal it. Don't let your shipment go to a warehouse and don't bounce it back to the sender; since odds are the shipper (because they are likely the importer of record) has already paid the duty, they're going to want their money back and you'll be out the money <em>and</em> the items. But, by golly, appeal it: just because you might agree with it politically doesn't mean they did it right.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>One of the first things any Rust programmer learns is that you can’t pass an object and a reference to that object around at the same time. It’s impossible to do, even indirectly. This limitation has been the subject of countless questions on Stack Overflow and posts on Reddit and the Rust forums and anywhere else where Rust programmers might ask for help. It’s so well-known that most people treat it like an axiom, not just a limitation of Rust <em>as it currently exists</em>, but an inherent limitation of borrow checking <em>in general</em>.</p>

<p>However, that’s not the case. In fact, with the right perspective, the way to support it is obvious. In this post, I’ll walk through the steps and show how self-borrows and much more could be supported in a hypothetical alternate or future version of Rust.</p>

<h3 id="but-first-some-obligatory-disclaimers">But first, some obligatory disclaimers</h3>

<p>To be clear, when I say something can’t be done in Rust, what I mean is that it can’t be done <em>in a safe, zero-cost way</em>. As an army of internet commenters are no doubt rushing to observe, any limitation of a static type system can be bypassed by using unsafety or runtime checks instead (e.g. “lol, just wrap everything in <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>” or “lol, just build your own memory management on top of <code>Vec</code> indices”). And the fact that a less safe or efficient workaround exists <em>is</em> of great interest to people who just need to solve a problem quickly. But from a language design perspective, the pertinent fact is that Rust’s type system has gaps which make certain common tasks impossible to do <em>in a way that lets Rust be Rust</em>, and not just a glorified C or Javascript.</p>

<p>Lastly, this post will discuss changes purely from a type checking perspective without regard to how hard they’d actually be to implement. In a major real-world language like Rust, <em>any</em> change, no matter how trivial, has a huge cost in terms of ecosystem, documentation, tooling, backwards compatibility, etc. But I’m a language design hobbyist, not a Rust compiler engineer, so language design is the part I’ll speak about.</p>

<p>So how do you type-check self borrows? The trick is actually to adopt an even more ambitious goal, <em>safe async functions</em>.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-rust">A brief history of Rust</h2>

<p>Rust 1.0 shipped with no support whatsoever for non-movable types. The fact that any value of any type could be arbitrarily memcpy’d around and still work was a core assumption of the language.</p>

<p>However, it didn’t take long before people realized that non-movable types are actually very useful. In particular, async functions nearly always produce non-movable future types, so you can’t have async Rust without support in some fashion for non-movable types.</p>

<p>Sadly, it was too late to do things properly (i.e. a <code>Move</code> auto-trait), but they were able to at least hack in partial support via the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/struct.Pin.html"><code>Pin</code></a> type, added in Rust 1.33.0.</p>

<h3 id="but-not-for-thee">…but not for thee</h3>

<p>Now if you’re like me, you might have thought, “Pin is added, which means support for self-borrows. Great, now I can refactor and simplify all my code!” Unfortunately, that’s not what actually happened.</p>

<p><code>Pin</code> made it possible for Rust code to <em>work with</em> and <em>pass around</em> non-movable types, but there was still no way to actually <em>create</em> them. That is a bit of dark magic that the compiler jealously hoards for itself. Whenever you write an async function, the compiler will magically generate a secret non-movable type, and <code>Pin</code> makes it possible to work with these types, but there is still no way to actually create self-referential types yourself (again, in safe, zero-cost code).</p>

<p>However, <strong>what if it didn’t have to be this way?</strong> Personally, I think async functions (and closures) should be desugared into 100% safe Rust code that the user <em>could</em> have written themselves if they wanted to. Not because users would necessary actually want to do that very often, but because having a desugared version of every magic feature is useful didactically and for low-level libraries, and because it forces Rust to be <em>honest about its type system</em> instead of papering over the cracks with compiler magic.</p>

<p>Since async functions have self-borrows, supporting them conveniently also implies support for self-borrows more generally. Now the only question is how to actually support safe async functions.</p>

<p>The rest of this post is divided into two parts. In part 1, I will cover the changes needed from a high level type system perspective, while in part 2, I’ll cover the remaining low level details.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-the-value-level">Part 1: The value level</h2>

<p>In order to make async functions possible in (safe) Rust, we first have to figure out why they <em>aren’t</em> possible already. Most people would answer “async functions have self-borrows, and it is impossible to support self-borrows in the borrow checker”, but that is the wrong way to look at things. The <em>actual</em> answer is that <strong>it is impossible to name the types of local variables</strong>.</p>

<p>To see why this is, consider how you would go about desugaring an async function. Suppose we have a simple async function <code>foo</code> that adds some numbers and calls another async function like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>sub</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Pin</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>Future</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Output</span><span>=</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>{</span><span>todo!</span><span>()}</span>

<span>async</span> <span>fn</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u32</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>12345</span><span>;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>sub</span><span>();</span>
    <span>f</span><span>.await</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>let</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>f2</span> <span>=</span> <span>sub</span><span>();</span>
    <span>f2</span><span>.await</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>How would we desugar <code>foo</code> by hand? We need to create a custom Future type <code>Foo</code> with a state machine representing the possible states of the original <code>foo</code> function. Specifically, we need a state machine with one state per <code>await</code> point in the function, plus a begin and end state. And the contents of each state are just the local variables that are live at that point in the function.</p>

<p>Therefore, our custom state machine type would look like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Initial</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Await1</span><span>{</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>Pin</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>Future</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Output</span><span>=</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><span>},</span>
    <span>Await2</span><span>{</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>f2</span><span>:</span> <span>Pin</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>Future</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Output</span><span>=</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span><span>},</span>
    <span>Final</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In order to create this type, we “just” have to list every local variable that is live at an await point, along with the types of all those local variables. Therefore, supporting async functions in safe Rust is just a matter of making it consistently possible to name the types of every variable. So why is this impossible to do right now? The first obstacle is <strong>unnameable types</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="unnameable-types">Unnameable types</h2>

<p><img src="https://blog.polybdenum.com/img/20240606_padme_rust.jpg"></p>

<p>Rust made the interesting design decision to <em>require</em> explicit type annotations on every function boundary and every custom type, and yet also make it <em>impossible</em> to write explicit types in many cases. This was already a problem in Rust 1.0 with closures, but got much worse a few years later with the introduction of async Rust and impl Trait.</p>

<p>Basically, some types (closures, async functions, impl Trait) <em>exist</em> in Rust’s type system but do not have a <em>name</em> and hence are impossible to <em>talk about</em> in your code. You can still pass those values around and interact with them as long as you never have to explicitly name their type, but as soon as you hit a function boundary or want to store them inside a struct or enum, whoops, it’s time to add generics or pointlessly <code>Box</code> everything up.</p>

<p>Even in the example code above, this is already a problem. I had to go out of my way to make <code>sub</code> return a boxed <code>dyn Future</code> in order to have a nameable type for the sake of example, but any realistic code would instead be working with unnameable futures everywhere.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this is also a very easy problem to solve - <strong>just give every type a name</strong>. Efforts to do this already have been indefinitely stalled over concerns about stabilizing the order of generic type parameters, but that’s a trivial concern compared to the much more invasive changes we’ll get into later.</p>

<h3 id="named-lifetimes">Named lifetimes</h3>

<p>There’s actually another kind of unnameable type as well - function local lifetimes. Unlike closures and futures, these can never cross a function boundary without being replaced by generic parameters, so they don’t cause problems for <em>existing</em> code, but they’re still types that can’t be named, and if we’re going to support async functions in Rust, we need a way to name them.</p>

<p>Any syntax actually added to Rust would obviously have to get bikeshedded to death and assessed for education and tooling and so on, but as I’m just a person writing a blog post, I’m under no such constraints, so for the sake of example, I’ll propose the following syntax:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>Vec</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
<span>life</span> <span>'a</span><span>,</span> <span>'b</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>v</span><span>;</span>
<span>// do stuff with r</span>
<span>end</span> <span>'a</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>r2</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'b</span> <span>mut</span> <span>v</span><span>;</span>
<span>// do stuff with r2</span>
<span>end</span> <span>'b</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In this proposal, you first declare a <em>lifetime token</em> via <code>life 'a</code>. This token represents a lifetime that lasts as long as the token exists. Next, when borrowing a reference, you can optionally specify an explicit lifetime, e.g. <code>&amp;'a mut v</code>. Finally, you can <em>end</em> a lifetime via <code>end 'a</code>, which consumes the token.</p>

<p>This syntax is more verbose than the current syntax, but I don’t expect users to actually use named lifetime syntax that often. I see it like <code>drop</code>. You <em>can</em> write all your <code>drop</code>s explicitly if you want to, but most of the time people let the compiler insert them implicitly instead. Likewise under my proposal, people will usually still use the current syntax and let the compiler implicitly insert anonymous lifetimes, but they can also write named lifetimes explicitly if they want to.</p>

<h3 id="static-checking">Static checking</h3>

<p>Under my named lifetimes proposal, <em>all checking is still done purely at compile time</em>, just like the existing borrow checker. The lifetime tokens only exist at compile time and there is no runtime impact.</p>

<p>In order to do all type checking statically, we have to enforce certain invariants. Specifically, <em>types can only refer to lifetimes in the current scope</em>. Any type that escapes outside of the scope of the lifetime token it refers to becomes invalid. Likewise, consuming a lifetime token invalidates all types that refer to that lifetime.</p>



<p>As it turns out, unnameable types aren’t the only barrier to naming the types of variables in Rust. Unnameable types are types that still exist in Rust’s formal type system, but don’t have names. However, Rust’s formal type system is only a subset of its de-facto type system because in addition to Rust’s official type checker, the compiler also incorporates <em>shadow type checkers</em> which do type-checking like things but are not formally part of the type checker.</p>

<p>There are types that are part of Rust’s de-facto type system which don’t even exist in Rust’s formal type system in the first place, let alone have names. I call these types <strong>inconceivable types</strong> because from the perspective of a Rust compiler engineer, they aren’t types and don’t even exist in the first place.</p>

<p>Therefore, in order to support async functions, we’ll also need to add all the missing inconceivable types into Rust’s formal type system.</p>

<h3 id="partial-moves">Partial moves</h3>

<p>What are these shadow type checkers? Consider the following Rust code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>mem</span><span>::</span><span>drop</span><span>;</span>

<span>#[derive(Default)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>MyStrings</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>async</span> <span>fn</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>ms</span> <span>=</span> <span>MyStrings</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>();</span>
    
    <span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>ms</span><span>.x</span><span>);</span>
    <span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>ms</span><span>.y</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>At first glance, this code shouldn’t compile. After all, <code>ms</code> is used twice, right? <code>ms</code> should already be moved when it is referenced the first time in <code>ms.x</code>, which would make <code>ms.y</code> a compile error. However, the Rust compiler actually allows this!</p>

<p>The reason is because Rust has a secret shadow type checker which allows you to partially move and partially borrow values as long as they stay within a function. The fact that this is limited to within a function makes it harder to spot since it never forces the user to write the function-boundary-mandatory type annotations that would be impossible since these types don’t actually exist in Rust’s formal type system.</p>

<p>However, they are still a problem for async functions because we need to be able to specify the types of <em>local</em> variables as well. Consider the following code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>fn</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>ms</span> <span>=</span> <span>MyStrings</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>();</span>
    
    <span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>ms</span><span>.x</span><span>);</span>
    <span>// What is ms's type here?!?!</span>
    <span>sub</span><span>()</span><span>.await</span><span>;</span>
    <span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>ms</span><span>.y</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>What is the type of <code>ms</code> at the await point? The formal type system would answer “oh, the type is <code>MyStrings</code>, that doesn’t change.” However, its <em>de-facto</em> type clearly does change. After all, you can’t access the <code>x</code> field on it like you could for any true value of type <code>MyStrings</code>. The true type is now something else entirely, an inconceivable type.</p>

<p>Therefore, the next step is to add the inconceivable types for partial borrows and partial moves to Rust’s formal type system, so that they can be referenced in type annotations. For this, I propose the syntax <code>Foo{bar, baz}</code>, to list the fields explicitly. E.g. <code>MyStrings{y}</code> means a value with the <em>memory layout</em> of <code>MyStrings</code>, but where only field <code>y</code> remains (with the <code>x</code> part being arbitrary uninitialized data). This can be extended to partial borrows as well, e.g. <code>&amp;mut Foo{bar, baz}</code>.</p>

<p>However, that’s not all. There’s still one more shadow type checker to deal with, and it’s a really big one. As it turns out, the borrow checker is <em>also</em> a shadow type checker.</p>

<h3 id="borrowed-types">Borrowed types</h3>

<p>Consider the following code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>fn</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Hello, world"</span><span>.to_string</span><span>();</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// What is the type of s here???</span>
    <span>sub</span><span>()</span><span>.await</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>r</span><span>.push</span><span>(</span><span>'!'</span><span>);</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>What is the type of <code>s</code> at the await point? Again, the formal type system says “it’s <code>String</code> the whole time, that doesn’t change”, but again that’s a lie. The de-facto type of <code>s</code> can’t be <code>String</code>, because it doesn’t support the operations of a value of type <code>String</code>. In fact, it doesn’t support <em>any</em> operations, because any attempt to access <code>s</code> at that point will result in a compile error.</p>

<p>Therefore, the type of <code>s</code> must be temporarily changing to some other, inconceivable type. Specifically, the types of <em>borrowed values</em> are inconceivable types.</p>

<p>For this, I propose the syntax <code>!'a mut String</code>, but to understand why, we’ll first have to go into a brief digression on the theoretical basis for borrow checking.</p>

<h2 id="why-borrow-checking">Why borrow checking?</h2>

<p>There’s a common misconception, even in the Rust community, that borrow checking is just a memory management strategy, just a quirk of languages in the C++ niche and not something you need in a language with garbage collection. In fact however, borrow checking is the inevitable consequence of <a href="https://blog.polybdenum.com/2023/03/05/fixing-the-next-10-000-aliasing-bugs.html">protecting against aliasing bugs</a>, regardless of which memory management strategy a language uses.</p>

<h3 id="affine-types">Affine types</h3>

<p>In a traditional language, if you have a value of type <code>T</code>, you can make any number of copies of that value that all still have type T, just by reading it:</p>

<div><pre><code>let foo: T = ...;
let bar: T = foo;
// foo and bar have type T
</code></pre></div>

<p>However, this doesn’t work if you want to reason about aliasing. In particular, if you have a type for <em>exclusively referenced</em> objects (written <code>xcl</code> in this section for the sake of example), it is not sound to allow copying like this, because then you’ll have two references to the same object, both of which think they are the only one.</p>

<p>Therefore, exclusive references must be <em>affine types</em>, meaning that they can only be used once.</p>

<h3 id="splitting">Splitting</h3>

<p>However, being able to use each value only once makes it impossible to write all but the most trivial programs. In order to do anything useful, you need to be able to <em>split</em> a type so you can use values more than once.</p>

<p>A type can be thought of as a set of permissions to access the associated value, and thus it is safe to copy a value as long as the <em>permissions</em> aren’t copied. Instead, the child values need to have a <em>disjoint</em> set of permissions.</p>

<p>For example, suppose we have an exclusive reference to an object with fields of type <code>T</code> and <code>U</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code>let a = {foo: _, bar: _};
// a has the type xcl {foo: T, bar: U};

let b = a as {foo: T};
// b has type xcl {foo: T}
// a has type xcl {bar: U}
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can create a second reference to the object by <em>splitting</em> the permissions - after the split <code>a</code> <em>only</em> has the ability to read the field <code>bar</code> while <code>b</code> <em>only</em> has the ability to read field foo. Since they can only read disjoint parts of the object, it is still sound to have two exclusive references to the same object. (Note: this is pseudocode in a high level language for the sake of example - Rust doesn’t actually work this way due to other, low level considerations).</p>

<p>For traditional types (or <code>Copy</code> types in Rust parlance), you have the splitting rule <code>T =&gt; T + T</code>. In other words, given a value of <code>T</code>, you can split it into two values that both still have type <code>T</code>. For affine types, that splitting rule doesn’t exist, but there are still other splitting rules that are sound. For example, you can split by fields as we just saw: <code>xcl {foo: T, bar: U} =&gt; (xcl {foo: T}) + (xcl {bar: U})</code>.</p>

<h3 id="temporal-splitting">Temporal splitting</h3>

<p>The previous splitting rule is <em>spacial</em> - you can split access over disjoint fields of an object. However, spatial splitting alone doesn’t get you very far. In order to write practical code, you need another splitting rule. Besides splitting access by <em>space</em>, you can also split access by <em>time</em>.</p>

<p>Specifically, you can create a second copy of the reference as long as one copy can only be accessed <em>before</em> a given time, and the other copy can only be accessed <em>after</em> a given time. Since the access is split into disjoint periods of time, this is still sound.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>life</span> <span>'a</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>42</span><span>];</span>
<span>// v has exclusive access to the object</span>

<span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>v</span><span>;</span>
<span>// r has exclusive access to the object before time a</span>
<span>// v has exclusive access to the object *after* time a</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is the essence of borrow checking. It’s not some arcane, low level memory management strategy, but just a natural, essential method of statically reasoning about <em>aliasing</em> in your code.</p>

<h3 id="negative-lifetime-bounds">Negative lifetime bounds</h3>

<p>Borrow checking involves two kinds of types - references that are valid <em>before</em> a given time, and references that are valid <em>after</em> a given time. The first kind is already part of Rust’s formal type system, the ordinary references you know and love. A value of type <code>&amp;'a mut T</code> has exclusive access <em>before</em> time <code>a</code>, and no access after time <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>However, Rust’s formal type system has no notion of the second kind of type, of references that are valid <em>after</em> a given time. This is the inconceivable type we need to add.</p>

<p>Since these are the opposite of normal lifetimes, it makes sense to use the “not” symbol <code>!</code>, e.g. <code>!'a</code>, which I call a <em>negative lifetime bound</em>. A bound of <code>'a</code> means the type is only valid <em>until</em> <code>a</code>, while a bound of <code>!'a</code> means it is only valid <em>after</em> <code>a</code> instead.</p>

<h2 id="bound-lifetimes">Bound lifetimes</h2>

<p>We can now express the types of all local variables, even the types that don’t currently exist in Rust, but there’s still one more problem. Recall that the example of named lifetimes looked like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>Vec</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
<span>life</span> <span>'a</span><span>,</span> <span>'b</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>v</span><span>;</span>
<span>// do stuff with r</span>
<span>end</span> <span>'a</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>r2</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'b</span> <span>mut</span> <span>v</span><span>;</span>
<span>// do stuff with r2</span>
<span>end</span> <span>'b</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The problem is that the lifetime tokens (<code>'a</code> and <code>'b</code>) are <em>themselves</em> part of the function’s local state, and thus <em>also</em> have to be stored inside the state machine enum. Therefore, we need a way to store lifetime tokens inside of objects.</p>

<p>My proposed syntax introduces a new expression, <code>bind 'a in x</code>, which <em>moves</em> the lifetime token ‘a into the value x. And likewise, we have new destructuring pattern syntax, <code>let bind 'a in x = y;</code>, to do the reverse. Lastly, this also adds a new type, <code>bind 'a in T</code>, representing a type <code>T</code> with bound lifetime token <code>'a</code>.</p>

<p>Note that lifetime tokens and lifetimes only exist at compile time and have no runtime representation. <code>bind 'a in v</code> and the like are noops that exist purely for the sake of static type checking, and <code>bind 'a in T</code> has the same runtime representation as <code>T</code>.</p>

<h3 id="moving-lifetime-tokens">Moving lifetime tokens</h3>

<p>With the <code>end 'a</code> syntax, the lifetime token <code>'a</code> is consumed in place, which means that we know precisely when it ends. All types in scope with a positive (<code>'a</code>) bound become invalid, while all types in scope with a negative bound (<code>!'a</code>) have the negative bound removed (returning it to the original, unborrowed type).</p>

<p>However, when we <em>move</em> a lifetime token into a value, types referring to that lifetime which were in the old scope but not the new scope have to be treated differently. In this case, the lifetime token is no longer in scope <em>without</em> being ended, and so we have to pessimistically invalidate both positive <em>and</em> negative bounds. Types that reference the lifetime which are still within the new scope (i.e. the value that the lifetime token was bound to) are unaffected.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>This can be pretty confusing, so let’s look at some examples to show how the new lifetime system works.</p>

<p>First, suppose you try to return a reference to a local variable:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>life</span> <span>'a</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>.to_string</span><span>());</span>
<span>// s has type Box&lt;String&gt;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>*</span><span>s</span><span>;</span>
<span>// r has type &amp;'a mut String</span>
<span>// s has type Box&lt;!'a mut String&gt;</span>
<span>return</span> <span>r</span><span>;</span> <span>// error: r is invalid</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This naturally results in a compile error because <code>r</code> has the type <code>&amp;'a mut String</code>, but the lifetime token <code>'a</code> is <em>local</em> to the function. Therefore, when r is returned, it is no longer within the scope where <code>'a</code> exists and hence is invalid.</p>

<p>Now suppose we try binding <code>'a</code> to <code>r</code> before returning it:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>life</span> <span>'a</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>.to_string</span><span>());</span>
<span>// s has type Box&lt;String&gt;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>*</span><span>s</span><span>;</span>
<span>// r has type &amp;'a mut String</span>
<span>// s has type Box&lt;!'a mut String&gt;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>bind</span> <span>'a</span> <span>in</span> <span>r</span><span>;</span>
<span>// ret has type (bind 'a in &amp;'a mut String)</span>
<span>// s has type invalid</span>
<span>return</span> <span>ret</span><span>;</span> <span>// error: s is invalid</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This time, <code>ret</code> contains its own lifetime token, and so is not invalidated when returning. However, moving the lifetime token <code>'a</code> into <code>ret</code> invalidates <code>s</code>. Returning causes <code>s</code> to be implicitly dropped, but it can’t be dropped because it is invalid, resulting in a compile error.</p>

<p>Finally, let’s try binding <code>'a</code> to a tuple of both <code>r</code> <em>and</em> <code>s</code> and returning that:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>life</span> <span>'a</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>.to_string</span><span>());</span>
<span>// s has type Box&lt;String&gt;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>*</span><span>s</span><span>;</span>
<span>// r has type &amp;'a mut String</span>
<span>// s has type Box&lt;!'a mut String&gt;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>bind</span> <span>'a</span> <span>in</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>);</span>
<span>// ret has type (bind 'a in (Box&lt;!'a mut String&gt;, &amp;'a mut String))</span>
<span>return</span> <span>ret</span><span>;</span> <span>// ok</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This time, everything works. We’ve just returned a string <em>along with a borrowed reference to that string</em> in a 100% safe and zero-cost manner!</p>

<h3 id="destructuring">Destructuring</h3>

<p>Now that we’ve successfully returned a self-borrowed object, let’s look at how you would <em>use</em> an object with self-borrows.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>:</span> <span>bind</span> <span>'a</span> <span>in</span> <span>(</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;!</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>String</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>String</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// v has type (bind 'a in (Box&lt;!'a mut String&gt;, &amp;'a mut String))</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>bind</span> <span>'b</span> <span>in</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>v</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// 'b is a lifetime token</span>
    <span>// s has type Box&lt;!'b mut String&gt;</span>
    <span>// r has type &amp;'b mut String</span>

    <span>r</span><span>.push_str</span><span>(</span><span>" world!"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>end</span> <span>'b</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// s has type Box&lt;String&gt;</span>
    <span>// r is invalid</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="external-lifetimes">External lifetimes</h2>

<p>So far, we’ve only looked at <em>owned</em> lifetime tokens. However, in some cases, you instead have a <em>reference</em> to an unknown lifetime token that exists elsewhere. There are two cases where this can happen:</p>

<p><strong>Generic lifetime parameters</strong></p>

<p>When a generic function is called, the generic lifetime parameters represent <em>some</em> lifetime which is owned by some caller of the function. These lifetimes are guaranteed to last at least as long as the function call, but could last longer.</p>

<p><strong>Destructured <em>references</em> to bound lifetimes</strong></p>

<p>In the previous example, we destructured an <em>owned value</em> that contained a lifetime token, resulting in the token being moved into the current scope.</p>

<p>If you destructure a <em>reference</em> to a value with a lifetime token, you instead get a reference to a lifetime token, rather than the token itself. These lifetimes are guaranteed to last at least as long as the destructured reference, but could last longer.</p>

<p>When you have a reference to an external lifetime, you can’t <em>end</em> or <em>move</em> the lifetime, since you don’t own the corresponding token. However, as long as the lifetime reference exists, you still can interact with types that refer to that lifetime.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of mutating a value with a bound lifetime via a mutable reference:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>foo</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'call</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'call</span> <span>mut</span> <span>(</span><span>bind</span> <span>'a</span> <span>in</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>'a</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>str</span><span>)))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// 'call is an external lifetime</span>
    <span>// v has type &amp;'call mut (bind 'a in (!'a String, &amp;'a str))</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>bind</span> <span>'b</span> <span>in</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>v</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// 'b is an external lifetime</span>
    <span>// s has type &amp;'call mut (!'b String)</span>
    <span>// r has type &amp;'call mut (&amp;'b str)</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>r1</span><span>,</span> <span>r2</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>r</span><span>.split_at</span><span>(</span><span>32</span><span>);</span>
    <span>// r1 and r2 have type (&amp;'b str)</span>

    <span>// can assign back to r since they both have type &amp;'b str</span>
    <span>*</span><span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>r2</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Lastly, we also need to add a type to represent bound <em>lifetime references</em> in a type. However, the recursion stops there because a reference to a reference to a lifetime is equivalent to just a reference to a lifetime, since they don’t actually have any state or runtime representation and can’t be mutated.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-the-bytes-level">Part 2: The bytes level</h2>

<p>If we were writing a high-level language, we’d already be done, but for Rust, we still have the low-level details to worry about.</p>

<p>There are two ways to consider a type system. The first is <em>what</em> your code does, in an abstract machine, with no concerns about how it is actually implemented. I call this “the value level”.</p>

<p>The second level is <em>how</em> your code does it, in terms of low level implementation details like how values are stored in memory, which I call “the bytes level”. In a high level language, this might not even be exposed to users, but as Rust is a systems language, it gives programmers control over low level details like this.</p>

<p>To keep things simple, Rust has a single type system which implicitly encodes both levels in a single type. Unfortunately, this means that the desired combination is sometimes simply not represented in Rust’s type system.</p>

<p>In particular, Rust conflates ownership of <em>values</em> with ownership of <em>the memory where those values are stored</em>. This isn’t just a problem for a <em>new</em> feature like async functions. It causes problems even in ordinary real-world Rust coding. In particular, it means that <code>Drop</code> has the wrong type signature because the correct type signature simply doesn’t exist in Rust.</p>

<h2 id="drop">Drop</h2>

<p>When I say “<code>Drop</code> has the wrong type signature”, some people might be thinking, “oh, you mean it should have wrapped <code>self</code> in <code>Pin</code>, right?”. But that’s just a minor inconvenience to people who are writing unsafe code anyway, and <code>Pin</code> itself only dates back to Rust 1.33.0. The problem I’m talking about is much worse. <strong><code>Drop</code> was broken, even in Rust 1.0</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, last year, I had a struct containing a Tokio oneshot channel, and I wanted to send on that channel when the container was dropped. No problem, I figured, this is exactly the kind of thing Rust is good at. Should be easy, right?</p>

<p>…right??</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>channel</span><span>:</span> <span>tokio</span><span>::</span><span>sync</span><span>::</span><span>oneshot</span><span>::</span><span>Sender</span><span>&lt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>Drop</span> <span>for</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// error[E0507]: cannot move out of `self.channel` which is behind a mutable reference</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.channel</span><span>.send</span><span>(());</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>As it turns out, this seemingly simple task is <em>impossible</em> to do in Rust. (And yes, as always, you can throw away static checking and just use <code>unsafe</code> or wrap your type in an unnecessary <code>Option</code> or whatever. I’m talking about <em>safe</em> <em>zero-cost</em> Rust here.)</p>

<p>The reason why this seemingly simple code pattern is impossible is right there in the error message. <code>Drop</code> takes <code>self</code> <em>by mutable reference</em>. In Rust, mutable references have the <em>invariant</em> that the type is unchanged. You can’t move fields out of a mutable reference (unless you replace them with another value of the same type).</p>

<p>The whole point of a destructor is to destruct your type. The value is disassembled and the type goes away. You start with <code>T</code> and end with <em>nothing</em>. However, <code>Drop</code> takes <code>&amp;mut T</code> instead, which has the postcondition that everything is unchanged and your <code>T</code> is still sitting there, good as always. Somehow, Rust ended up with a destructor api <em>that can’t actually destruct anything</em>.</p>

<p>So how did Rust make such an obvious mistake? The problem is that the Rust designers painted themselves into a corner in a misguided attempt to minimize the number of types in the formal type system.</p>

<h3 id="owned-references">Owned references</h3>

<p>Currently, Rust has three kinds of types: <code>T</code>, <code>&amp;mut T</code>, and <code>&amp;T</code>. If you plot their ownership and representation, you get this:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Owned?</th>
      <th>Representation</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>yes</td>
      <td>inline</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&amp;mut T</td>
      <td>no</td>
      <td>pointer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&amp;T</td>
      <td>no</td>
      <td>pointer</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Notice something missing? There is no possible type with “yes, pointer” (or “no, inline” for that matter, but that doesn’t matter much). Rust conflates <em>ownership</em> with <em>representation</em>. (More specifically, there is no way to own a <em>value</em> without owning the underlying memory - <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> is technically an owned pointer, but the pointer can only point to its own, owned memory, not memory that is managed elsewhere.)</p>

<p>In Rust, there is no way to transfer ownership of a value without <em>moving</em> the value. This was a major problem when Rust added async and decided that it needed to deal with non-movable types after all. Since the assumption of movability is built into the language in such a core way, there was no way to add non-movable types other than just saying “ok, everything related to them is unsafe, but here’s <code>Pin</code> so you can at least partially hide the unsafety from your users, have fun”.</p>

<p><code>Drop</code> can’t take <code>self</code> as a mutable reference because mutable references can’t be destructed, as discussed above. But it <em>also</em> can’t take <code>self</code> by <em>value</em>, because that makes it impossible to drop non-movable types. (There are also minor considerations around recursion, presumably the reason <code>Drop</code> didn’t take values even <em>before</em> Rust added non-movable types.)</p>

<p>The solution to this dilemma is that the <em>correct</em> type for <code>Drop</code> to take is a type that currently doesn’t exist - an <em>owned reference</em>, which I’ll write <code>&amp;own T</code>.</p>

<p><code>&amp;own T</code> is similar to <code>&amp;mut T</code>, except that it <em>owns</em> the referenced value. This means that it has no post-conditions like <code>&amp;mut T</code> does, and you can freely move fields out of the reference, and it will implicitly drop anything remaining when it goes out of scope. However, unlike <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>&amp;own T</code> does not own the <em>memory</em>, meaning you can take an <code>&amp;own T</code> reference to values on the stack when you need to drop them, and even recursively take <code>&amp;own T</code> references to fields.</p>

<h3 id="owned-reference-example">Owned reference example</h3>

<p>So what would a <em>correct</em> version of <code>Drop</code> look like? Let’s look at an example.</p>

<p>First, let’s start with a simple struct with some fields and methods:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>MyStrings</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>MyStrings</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>some_method</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{} {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>self</span><span>.x</span><span>,</span> <span>self</span><span>.y</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can implement <code>Drop</code> like this. <code>self</code> starts out as an owned reference to the full type, meaning we can call methods on it like normal. Once we move fields out of it, the type of <code>self</code> changes to the corresponding partial type (recall that Rust already supports partially moved types as an inconceivable type).</p>

<div><pre><code><span>impl</span> <span>Drop</span> <span>for</span> <span>MyStrings</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>own</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// self has type &amp;own MyStrings</span>
     
        <span>// we can call methods within drop()</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.some_method</span><span>();</span>
     
        <span>// now let's move a field</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>_</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.x</span><span>;</span>
        <span>// self now has type &amp;own MyStrings{y}</span>
     
        <span>// we're too lazy to drop the other field, but it will be dropped implicitly</span>
        <span>// drop(self.y)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When an owned reference goes out of scope, all remaining fields are dropped implicitly, not just inside a <code>drop</code> method, but anywhere an <code>&amp;own T</code> exists. This is important a) for avoiding leaks while unwinding when an exception is thrown and b) because people will often not explicitly drop everything in a <code>drop</code> impl.</p>

<h3 id="initialization">Initialization</h3>

<p><code>Drop</code> isn’t the only place where non-movable types cause a problem. Rust’s entire design is centered around the assumption that you can move anything. You move values to transfer ownership, you move values to change types, you move values to initialize objects, etc. Therefore, making Rust usable for non-movable types requires more changes.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we <em>already</em> have to support partially moved types <em>anyway</em>, and that also conveniently covers the initialization case as well as the destruction case. Initialization is basically the same process as dropping, just in reverse:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>new</span> <span>=</span> <span>MyStrings</span><span>{};</span>
<span>// new has type MyStrings{}, a partially moved value</span>
<span>// this has the *memory layout* of MyStrings, but with no fields initialized</span>

<span>new</span><span>.x</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span><span>.to_string</span><span>();</span>
<span>// new has type MyStrings{x}</span>

<span>new</span><span>.y</span> <span>=</span> <span>"World"</span><span>.to_string</span><span>();</span>
<span>// new has type MyStrings{x,y}, which is the same as a fully initialized MyStrings</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="safe-transmute">Safe transmute</h2>

<p>However, there’s still one problem - in-place transmutes between different <em>base</em> types.</p>

<p>Recall that our future state machine enum looks something like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>MyFuture</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Initial</span><span>(</span><span>State0</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Await1</span><span>(</span><span>State1</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Await2</span><span>(</span><span>State2</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Final</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Our previous examples with drop and initialization changed the <em>actual</em> type (i.e. with different fields initialized or not), but the <em>base</em> type (which controls memory layout and method resolution) was the same. However, here, each enum variant has a <em>different</em> base type.</p>

<p>Currently in Rust, you always have to move values when converting between different base types. E.g. even just wrapping a value in a newtype (or unwrapping it) requires moving the value. However, the “move and reconstruct” paradigm won’t work here because our enum variants may contain <em>non-movable</em> types. Therefore, we need a way to convert between the different state types <em>in-place</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore, we need to add three things to Rust:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A way to specify that different types have the same memory layout</li>
  <li>A way to specify that certain fields have the same location within the type for different types</li>
  <li>The type system understands this and allows safe transmutes between them.</li>
  <li>Allow updating enums in a way that is aware of this.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>Suppose we have an async function like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>fn</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>mut</span> <span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>
    <span>sub</span><span>()</span><span>.await</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>let</span> <span>z</span> <span>=</span> <span>if</span> <span>true</span> <span>{</span><span>r</span><span>.as_bytes</span><span>()}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span><span>"hello"</span><span>.as_bytes</span><span>()};</span>
    <span>sub</span><span>()</span><span>.await</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>z</span><span>);</span>
    <span>sub</span><span>()</span><span>.await</span><span>;</span>
    
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The corresponding future enum states are as follows, where <code>SubFut</code> is the name of the anonymous future type returned by the <code>sub()</code> function.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>State0</span> <span>{</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>State1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>!</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>String</span><span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>State3</span> <span>{</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>}</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>MyFuture</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Initial</span><span>(</span><span>State0</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Await1</span><span>(</span><span>bind</span> <span>'a</span> <span>in</span> <span>State1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>SubFut</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Await2</span><span>(</span><span>bind</span> <span>'a</span> <span>in</span> <span>State2</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>SubFut</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Await3</span><span>(</span><span>State3</span><span>,</span> <span>SubFut</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Final</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The problem comes when we need to implement the state transitions (within the <code>poll</code> method). Since <code>State1</code> and <code>State2</code> contain a non-movable field (<code>s</code>), they have to be converted <em>in-place</em>.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what the best way to do this is, but I’m assuming we have some sort of annotation which allows us to mark that these types all use the same memory layout, and that <code>s</code> is located in the same place in each type, allowing us to safely transmute between them.</p>

<p>The basic transition process for say, state 1 to state 2, is to start with an owned reference to <code>State1</code>. Then we remove the <code>r</code> field and use it to compute <code>z</code>, as per the code between the two await points. This leaves the pointer with type <code>State1{s}</code>. Then we can safely transmute this to <code>State2{s}</code>, since <code>s</code> is guaranteed to be in the same place in both types. Finally, we add the <code>z</code> field back, to get a full <code>State2</code>.</p>

<h2 id="safe-enum-updates">Safe enum updates</h2>

<p>There’s still the question of how the compiler knows that enums are being updated in a safe manner.</p>

<h3 id="mut-to-own">&amp;mut to &amp;own</h3>

<p>The first question is how to temporarily violate the type invariants during the update. <code>poll</code> takes a <em>mutable</em> reference to <code>self</code>, but in Rust, <code>&amp;mut T</code> is required to preserve the type invariants of <code>T</code> at all times (well, there are some minor exceptions, but those are built into the compiler, not something users have direct access to).</p>

<p>You’re not allowed to move out of a mutable reference, because if this were allowed, and an exception were thrown and then caught, someone could access the reference again even though the pointee is now invalid. Therefore, we need to somehow get an owned reference to the enum variant instead.</p>

<p>However, there’s one workaround. You can’t temporarily move out of a <code>&amp;mut T</code> because that would violate the invariant of <code>T</code>, but you <em>can</em> move out of a <code>&amp;mut Option&lt;T&gt;</code>. Basically, we’ve widened the type invariant of the pointee to now include an “invalid” state. That state will never be seen in normal operation (assuming we always put the value back when done with it), but would be seen if an exception is thrown while the value is removed, and then that exception is caught and the reference accessed again.</p>

<p>For normal code, wrapping everything in an <code>Option</code> means adding a runtime cost and runtime type checks, which is why I ruled it out in previous discussions (e.g. restricting the discussion to “safe, <em>zero-cost</em> Rust”). However, it turns out that the <code>Future</code> api <em>already</em> effectively forces everything to have an extra “invalid” state anyway, so there’s no additional cost to having one. This is the reason for the extra <code>Final</code> state in all the enums shown above.</p>

<p>Therefore, when updating the enum state during <code>poll</code>, we start by setting the tag to <code>Final</code>, which lets us get ownership over the current contents of the enum. Under normal operation, we would then set it back to a valid state, but if an exception is thrown in the middle and then caught and the future is re-polled, the future would just be in the <code>Final</code> state (which will panic when polled, like a future typically will when polled after completion).</p>

<h3 id="tracking-self-ness">Tracking self-ness</h3>

<p>The basic process is to start by setting the enum tag to <code>Final</code>, which gives an <em>owned</em> reference to the former contents of the enum variant, much like how you can take an owned value out of a <code>&amp;mut Option&lt;T&gt;</code> (except that taking an owned <em>reference</em> is not something that currently exists in Rust).</p>

<p>Then we perform various mutations through the owned reference, which changes its type from <code>&amp;own State1</code> to <code>&amp;own State2</code> or whatever. Finally, once the variant pointer is updated to the correct type, we can set the tag of the original enum to match, thus restoring the invariant.</p>

<p>However, the last part is trickier than it sounds. The problem is that even if we have a <code>&amp;mut MyFuture</code> (with the variant part currently borrowed) and a <code>&amp;own State2</code> or whatever, the compiler can’t know that it is safe to set the tag back to <code>Await2</code> <em>because it doesn’t know that the <code>&amp;own State2</code> actually points to the enum you’re trying to update</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore, we need to add a function-local analysis pass to the compiler to facilitate this. When you borrow the variant of an enum, the compiler will keep track of the relation between the two local variables as long as they stay in the function, and allow a safe update of the enum if the variant pointer has the corresponding type.</p>

<h3 id="another-inconceivable-type">Another inconceivable type?</h3>

<p>Now you might be wondering, isn’t that enum-alias analysis pass yet another shadow type checker? Does this mean we have <em>another</em> inconceivable type to add to the type system?</p>

<p>It <em>is</em> a shadow type checker, but fortunately we don’t have to add it to the type system. The reason is that in order to support safe async functions, we need to be able to name the type of any local variable <em>that is held across an await point</em>. Therefore, we only need to add inconceivable types to the type system <em>if it is possible for them to exist across an await</em>.</p>

<p>As shown earlier, partially moved types and borrowed types can both exist across an await, which is why we have to add them to the type system. However, if we’re adding a <em>new</em> shadow type checker, we can just arbitrarily declare that the analysis stops at awaits, which avoids the need to add any new types to the formal type system.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the only thing we actually <em>need</em> the enum-alias pass for is to support safe enum updates within the <code>Future::poll</code> method, and <code>poll</code> is a non-async method, which means it can never contain awaits anyway. Therefore, there’s no problem with restricting our new safe enum update feature to not span awaits.</p>

<h3 id="leak">Leak</h3>

<p>This sort of ad-hoc special analysis is certainly not elegant. In an ideal world, Rust would not have to have any inconceivable types at all, not even ones that don’t cross awaits. And it certainly would be <em>possible</em> to turn this into a general purpose feature that is a first-class part of the type system.</p>

<p>However, doing this the proper way would require the introduction of <em>non-forgettable types</em>. Some people have already been asking for non-forgettable types to be added to Rust anyway for unrelated reasons (via a “<code>Leak</code>” auto-trait), but the results would not be pretty.</p>

<p>This post is already very long, and non-forgettable types would add much <em>more</em> complexity than anything I’ve covered, since it violates a more central assumption of the language than even non-movable types do. Therefore, for the sake of keeping this proposal <em>merely</em> very long and minimizing the complexity of Rust as much as possible, I think it’s best to just punt on that subject and implement enum alias checking via special compiler magic rather than non-forgettable types.</p>

<p>The “special compiler magic” approach has the downside that it will be impossible to factor parts of the <code>poll</code> method out into separate helper functions, because the required types won’t exist in the type system and hence can’t be named in the function signature, but I think that’s a small price to pay for leaving this can of worms unopened.</p>

<h2 id="pin-and-move">Pin and Move</h2>

<p>With that out of the way, there’s one last topic to address, <code>Pin</code>.</p>

<p>You may have noticed a conspicuous lack of <code>Pin</code> in all my examples. That’s because <code>Pin</code> was just a hack added due to the inability to introduce a <code>Move</code> auto-trait in a fully backwards compatible manner. But since the changes I’m proposing require breaking strict backwards compatibility <em>anyway</em> (good luck fixing the type signature of <code>Drop</code> in a backwards compatible manner!), we might as well assume that <code>Pin</code> gets replaced by a <code>Move</code> auto-trait for moveable types while we’re at it.</p>

<p>However, we still need a way to replicate the functions <code>Pin</code> is currently serving, as it doesn’t work quite the same way that <code>Move</code> would.</p>

<h3 id="enum-refinements">Enum refinements</h3>

<p>In current Rust, when a <code>Future</code> is initially created, you can freely move it around. However, you have to pin it before you can <em>poll</em> it, and once polled, it becomes unmovable.</p>

<p>In a <code>Move</code> world, this is basically saying that the <code>Initial</code> state of every future enum state machine has to be <code>Move</code>, but the other states of the enum may be non-<code>Move</code>. Since <code>poll</code> takes the enum by <code>&amp;mut</code>, it can switch between the states and thus the future has to be assumed to be non-movable after polling.</p>

<p>However, Rust’s current design doesn’t support any way to reason like that. Rust’s current type system is designed around the assumption that every value has exactly one type and that type never changes, which means that there is no way to talk about properties that hold now but not in the future. If an enum type implements an auto-trait, that means that <em>every</em> variant of the enum satisfies that trait, not just one variant.</p>

<p>This isn’t just a problem for futures. It often comes up in current Rust with <code>Copy</code> too, as in “why can’t I copy <code>None</code>”? For example, the following code will not compile because the array initial value has to be <code>Copy</code>, but <code>Option&lt;SomeNotCopyType</code> is not <code>Copy</code> due to the unused <code>Some</code> variant.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>SomeNotCopyType</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>foo</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>SomeNotCopyType</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span> <span>8</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>None</span><span>;</span> <span>8</span><span>];</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Therefore, we need a way to distinguish between “every variant of the enum satisfies this property” and “the <em>current</em> variant of the enum satisfies this property”. The syntax <code>T: Future + Move</code> already means the former, so we need to come up with different syntax for the latter.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what the best syntax is, so I’ll just go with <code>T: Future if Move</code>. <code>T: Future if Move</code> means “<code>T</code> is (any) future, <em>and</em> the value is <em>currently</em> <code>Move</code>”, while <code>T: Future + Move</code> instead means “T is a future type where every variant is <code>Move</code>” (which would be <code>Unpin</code> in current Rust).</p>

<p>Since explicit trait implementations can only be done for the enum type as a whole, this sort of “per-variant trait impl” only makes sense for auto-traits and lifetimes. Therefore, the right side is restricted to auto-traits and lifetime bounds. <code>T: Future if (Move + 'static)</code> would be allowed, but <code>T: Future if Clone</code> would not.</p>

<p>Additionally, the “if” syntax can also be applied to <em>explicit</em> non-generic enum types. E.g <code>foo: MyEnum if Copy</code> means <code>foo</code> has type <code>MyEnum</code> <em>and</em> its current variant is one that is <code>Copy</code>.</p>

<h3 id="stable-deref-types">Stable deref types</h3>

<p>In general, every borrowed type will be non-moveable. However, container types such as <code>Box</code>, <code>Vec</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>Rc</code>, etc. could optionally tell the compiler that borrowing the <em>contents</em> of the container does not cause the container itself to become non-moveable. This is what makes it possible to return data along with a pointer to that data. The outer value will always be moved by Rust’s nature, but this is still safe as long as the <em>borrowed</em> data does not move.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Whew, we’re finally done! We’ve finally seen how to safely implement self-borrows and safe async functions in Hypothetical Future Rust.</p>

<p>To be honest, I think there’s approximately zero chance that this gets implemented in Rust, since the nature of a language with a large ecosystem means that you can’t just break backwards compatibility, and even seemingly trivial changes in Rust have been held up forever due to concerns around stabilization or documentation or whatever.</p>

<p>However, I hope that this post still helps people to think about the nature of the problem. In particular, it’s frustrating to see people say that self-borrows are an inherent impossibility with borrow checking when that limitation is really just a consequence of idiosyncratic choices made by Rust, and if not in current Rust, it certainly could have been supported in an alternate history Rust that made slightly different choices, and likely will be supported in future languages with borrow checking.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you have any comments or suggestions, please let me know by commenting on Reddit.</p>

    } else if (linktype == DLT_IEEE802_11) {
        got_radiotap = 0;
    } else {
        pcap_close(handle);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    pd = pcap_dump_open(handle, PCAP_SAVEFILE);
    pcap_loop(handle, -1 /*INFINITY*/, &amp;parse_packet, (unsigned char *) pd);
}
    </pre></code></p><p>
    The data from the libpcap loop is then given to <code>libwifi_get_frame()</code> which checks for frame validity and type/subtype, and stores the data in a <code>struct libwifi_frame</code>.
    </p><p><code><pre>void parse_packet(unsigned char *args,
                  const struct pcap_pkthdr *header,
                  const unsigned char *packet) {
    unsigned long data_len = header-&gt;caplen;
    unsigned char *data = (unsigned char *) packet;

    struct libwifi_frame frame = {0};
    int ret = libwifi_get_wifi_frame(&amp;frame, data, data_len, got_radiotap);
    if (ret != 0) {
        printf("[!] Error getting libwifi_frame: %d\n", ret);
        return;
    }
    </pre></code></p><p>
    The <code>libwifi_frame</code> struct can then be given to one of the frame parser functions, such as <code>libwifi_parse_beacon()</code>. Since the header comment for
    <code>libwifi_parse_beacon()</code> indicates that the parsed data is stored in a <code>struct libwifi_bss</code>, we need to initalise one and pass it as a parameter.
    </p><p>
    We'll use the BSS struct to easily show the SSID and Channel from the sniffed beacon frame.
    </p><p><code><pre>    if (frame.frame_control.type == TYPE_MANAGEMENT &amp;&amp;
        frame.frame_control.subtype == SUBTYPE_BEACON) {
        struct libwifi_bss bss = {0};

        int ret = libwifi_parse_beacon(&amp;bss, &amp;frame);
        if (ret != 0) {
            printf("Failed to parse beacon: %d\n", ret);
            return;
        }

        printf("SSID: %s, Channel: %d\n", bss.ssid, bss.channel);
    }
}
    </pre></code></p>
    <h2>Generation</h2><p>
    For frame generation, you only need to provide the required data to one of the frame generation functions. In this example, <code>libwifi_create_beacon()</code>.
    </p><p><code><pre>int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    struct libwifi_beacon beacon = {0};
    static unsigned char bcast[] = "\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF";
    static unsigned char tx[] = "\x00\x20\x91\xAA\xBB\CC";

    int ret = libwifi_create_beacon(&amp;beacon, bcast, tx, tx, "wifi-beacon", 11);
    if (ret != 0) {
        return ret;
    }
    </pre></code></p><p>
    From here, we can use the dumper function for this frame subtype to write the beacon in raw byte format to a buffer. This can be useful for writing the
    generated frame out to a pcap file using <code>pcap_dump()</code> or transmitting from a monitor mode interface.
    </p><p><code><pre>    unsigned char *buf = NULL;
    size_t buf_sz = libwifi_get_beacon_length(&amp;beacon);

    buf = malloc(buf_sz);
    if (buf == NULL) {
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    ret = libwifi_dump_beacon(&amp;beacon, buf, buf_sz);
    if (ret &lt; 0) {
        return ret;
    }

    // Inject frame bytes or write bytes to file

    libwifi_free_beacon(&amp;beacon);
    free(buf);
}
    </pre></code></p>

	<h2>About</h2>

	<p>AsciiMath is an easy-to-write markup language for mathematics.<br>
		Try it out in the interactive renderer:</p>

	<p><label for="demoSource">Input:</label>
		<br>

</section>

<section id="gettingStarted">
	<h2>Getting Started</h2>

	<p>In order to get started you have two options:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>Use <a href="https://mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> to render your formulas.
				MathJax is a full fledged open source JavaScript display engine for
				mathematics and <strong>works in all browsers.</strong><br>
				This is the recommended approach!</p>

			<p>Get started by loading the default AsciiMath configuration:</p>

			<p>
				<code>&lt;script
					src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.4/latest.js?config=AM_CHTML"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
			</p>
	
			<p>Visit the MathJax <a href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html">Getting Started</a> 
				page to find other CDN options , or to learn how to install MathJax locally on your server.</p> 
				
			<p>Text in your HTML enclosed in <code>`</code> (backticks) will now get
				rendered as a math formula. The math delimiters can also be customized.
				Check out the <a href="https://mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> website for more
				information!</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Load the AsciiMath javascript file
				(<a href="http://git.io/X84VQQ">get it on GitHub</a>)
				in either the <code>head</code> or the <code>body</code>
				tag of your website like this:</p>

			<p>
				<code>&lt;script
					src="ASCIIMathML.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
			</p>

			<p>This file contains JavaScript to convert AsciiMath
				notation and (some) LaTeX to Presentation MathML. The conversion
				is done while the HTML page loads.</p>

			<p>
				<mark><strong>Attention:</strong> Currently this only works in
					Firefox and Safari.  
				</mark>
			</p>

			<p>While HTML5 now includes MathML as an official
				recommendation, the remaining browsers do not appear to be
				implementing it.  For widest browser compatibility, the use
				of MathJax is recommended.</p>

		</li>
	</ol>
</section>

<section id="syntax">
<h2>Syntax</h2>

	<p>Most AsciiMath symbols attempt to mimic in text what they look like 
	   rendered, like <code>oo</code> for `oo`.  Many symbols can also be
	   displayed using a TeX alternative, but a preceeding backslash is not 
	   required.</p>

<h3>Standard Functions</h3>

<p>sin, cos, tan, sec, csc, cot, 
arcsin, arccos, arctan, sinh, cosh, tanh, sech, csch, coth, exp, log, ln,
det, dim, mod, gcd, lcm, lub, glb, min, max, f, g.</p>

<br>

<h3>Special Cases</h3>

<p>Matrices: <code>[[a,b],[c,d]]</code> yields to `[[a,b],[c,d]]`</p>

<p>Column vectors: <code>((a),(b))</code> yields to `((a),(b))`</p>

<p>Augmented matrices: <code>[[a,b,|,c],[d,e,|,f]]</code> yields to `[[a,b,|,c],[d,e,|,f]]`</p>

<p>Matrices can be used for layout:
 <code>{(2x,+,17y,=,23),(x,-,y,=,5):}</code> yields
 `{(2x,+,17y,=,23),(x,-,y,=,5):}`</p>
 
<p>Complex subscripts: <code>lim_(N-&gt;oo) sum_(i=0)^N</code> yields to `lim_(N-&gt;oo) sum_(i=0)^N`</p>

<p>Subscripts must come before superscripts:
	<code>int_0^1 f(x)dx</code> yields to `int_0^1 f(x)dx`</p>
	
<p>Derivatives: <code> f'(x) = dy/dx</code> yields `f'(x) = dy/dx`<br>
	For variables other than x,y,z, or t you will need grouping symbols: 
	<code> (dq)/(dp)</code> for `(dq)/(dp)`</p>

<p>Overbraces and underbraces:
	<code>ubrace(1+2+3+4)_("4 terms")</code> yields `ubrace(1+2+3+4)_("4 terms")`.<br>
	<code>obrace(1+2+3+4)^("4 terms")</code> yields `obrace(1+2+3+4)^("4 terms")`.
</p>

<p>Attention: Always try to surround the <code>&gt;</code> and
	<code>&lt;</code> characters with spaces so that the html parser does not
	confuse it with an opening or closing tag!</p>
<br>


<h3>The Grammar</h3>

<p>Here is a definition of the grammar used to parse AsciiMath expressions.
	In the Backus-Naur form given below, the letter on the left of the
	<code>::=</code> represents a category of symbols that could be one
	of the possible sequences of symbols listed on the right.
	The vertical bar <code>|</code> separates the alternatives.</p>

<pre id="grammar">v ::= [A-Za-z] | greek letters | numbers | other constant symbols
u ::= sqrt | text | bb | other unary symbols for font commands

<p>The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0d424625-f4f8-4646-9f6e-927c8cbe0e3e"><em>Financial Times</em> reports</a> that Apple has stepped up its preparations for the handover of the CEO role from Tim Cook. Here are the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-apple-steps-up-tim-cook-s-succession-efforts">Apple steps up Tim Cook’s succession efforts</h2>



<p>According to the FT’s sources, Apple’s board and senior executives have “recently intensified” the company’s succession planning for its top role.</p>



<p>The <em>FT</em> adds that although Apple’s Senior VP of Hardware Engineering, John Ternus, is the most likely to take the reins of the company, “no final decisions have been made”.</p>



<p>While the report doesn’t mention why Apple is accelerating its succession efforts, it notes that the move is not tied to the company’s performance:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“People close to Apple say the long-planned transition is not related to the company’s current performance, ahead of what is expected to be a blockbuster end-of-year sales period for the iPhone.</p>



<p>(…)</p>



<p>The company is unlikely to name a new CEO before its next earnings report in late January, which covers the critical holiday period.”</p>
</blockquote>




	<p>Their sources also cautioned that “although preparations have intensified, the timing of any announcement could change”.</p>



<p>This report lands just hours after former Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/11/14/apple-ex-coo-jeff-williams-now-officially-retired/">spent his last day at Apple</a>, following the retirement announcement <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/07/08/apple-coo-jeff-williams-stepping-down-later-this-month/">he made in July</a>.</p>



<p>Williams had already handed operational leadership to Sabih Khan earlier this year, and his remaining responsibilities were <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/10/09/apple-folds-health-and-fitness-into-services-splits-apple-watch-oversight/">recently redistributed</a> among other top executives, Ternus among them.</p>



<p>Apple has also recently gone through a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/03/apple-cfo-luca-maestri/">CFO transition</a>, with longtime finance chief Luca Maestri stepping down and handing the role to Kevan Parekh, who previously served as the company’s vice president of Financial Planning and Analysis.</p>

<p id="15905113-780b-45b9-973e-ebd4fcdffa94">AMD increased its share across all markets served by x86 processors at Intel's expense in the third quarter of 2025, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://www.mercuryresearch.com/" target="_blank" data-url="http://www.mercuryresearch.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link">Mercury Research</a>. Intel is holding strong, and as its latest offerings for client and server systems got significantly more competitive than they were several quarters ago, the pace of AMD's gains has slowed down considerably. However, during the quarter, AMD achieved two important milestones: it now commands shipments of over 25% of all x86 CPUs, and it now ships over 33% (one-third) of desktop x86 CPUs.</p><h2 id="abnormal-market-performance-shipments-of-x86-cpus-flat-quarter-over-quarter-3">Abnormal market performance: Shipments of x86 CPUs flat quarter-over-quarter</h2><p id="812aa114-6fad-46f2-b319-8dc06ce20264">Normally, we start our coverage of the x86 market based on data from Mercury Research with client CPUs, but the third quarter was very unusual as unit shipments of x86 CPUs were flat quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), which significantly contradicts the normal seasonal bump when PC makers start to prep for the back-to-school (BTS) season in June – July as well as Christmas season in September.</p><p id="812aa114-6fad-46f2-b319-8dc06ce20264-1">Indeed, PC and server makers increased their CPU procurements in Q3, but the weakness came almost entirely from Intel, which saw sharp drops in IoT/SoC and entry-level mobile processors as it shifted manufacturing capacity toward server processors, and strong shipments of such parts in Q2. By contrast, AMD's unit shipments were flat to slightly up, so the company gained share sequentially and year-over-year (YoY), hitting two psychologically important milestones.</p><p>For the first time in years, AMD's unit share of all x86 client and server CPUs shipped exceeded 25% and now stands at 25.6%, up from 24.2% in the prior quarter and up from 24% in the same quarter a year ago. Intel still commands 74.4%, but it lost some share in certain segments, allowing AMD to hit an important milestone amid a market shrink.</p><p>If we add embedded, IoT, and game consoles SoCs to the equation, then AMD's share looks even more impressive: a 30.9% share of all x86-based chips, up from 25% in the third quarter of 2024. While Intel maintains its dominant position with 69.1%, its 5.9% YoY share loss does not look very good. Yet, it should be noted that AMD shipped significantly more game console SoCs in the third quarter this year compared to the third quarter of 2024, which inflated its results a bit.</p><p id="afae9d47-3d08-47f8-9016-c3c7ddf03fb0">Strong desktop and mobile CPU lineups as well as Intel struggles with supply of small-core mobile CPUs and prior-generation desktop offerings allowed AMD to slightly outgrow Intel in the third quarter both sequentially and year-over-year, according to data from Mercury Research.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="8d129087-6efe-4aae-8f17-d928cb02454a"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

If we compare AMD's current share to its share in the second quarter of 2024, the gain would be a whopping 10.6%</p><p>Intel still held the majority of desktop shipments, but its share fell from 67.8% to 66.4% QoQ, and from 71.7% YoY, reflecting AMD’s continued gains in both the mainstream and high-end segments and shortages of Intel's 13th and 14th Core 'Raptor Lake' processors that are still popular three years after their original release in 2022.</p><p>On the revenue front, AMD reached another record quarter for desktop CPU revenue, driven by higher shipments and a strong mix of premium SKUs, as the company noted in its conference call a week ago. Intel's revenue position weakened as its unit share declined and AMD absorbed more of the market's high-margin demand. Mercury Research notes that AMD's revenue growth in desktops significantly outpaced its unit growth, which confirms that the red company continued to strengthen its position in the most profitable parts of the desktop market.</p><p id="d336c17d-753e-47ea-ba4e-1de0853c505c">AMD lost market share to Intel in the mobile CPU space in Q1 and Q2 2025, but the company outperformed Intel in Q3 2025 on a sequential basis, gaining unit share as Intel struggled with reduced shipments of its entry-level small-core processors.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="2cd72f79-802d-48f8-81ac-0ffdcb13ada8"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

Both companies saw YoY shipment growth, but AMD's increase was stronger, helping it push unit share higher compared to the same quarter a year earlier, so overall things look good for AMD.</p><p>Most of the real action in Q3 came from product mix rather than volume, according to Mercury. AMD's EPYC 'Turin' ramp accelerated, driving stronger demand for high-core-count EPYC processors, while Intel saw increasing adoption of Xeon 6 'Granite Rapids,' which helped lift its average selling prices despite slightly lower unit volumes.</p><p>On the revenue side, AMD hit another all-time high, as the mix shifted heavily toward its latest and more expensive EPYC 9005-series platform. The combination of flat unit shipments and rising prices meant that AMD's server revenue continues to grow significantly faster than its unit share, while Intel's revenue gains were more limited due to modest declines in its overall shipment mix.</p><h2 id="summary-3">Summary</h2><p id="61822df5-6cbc-4098-a9a6-7dd35b4db4b0">In terms of unit share, AMD continued to gain ground in Q3 2025 across nearly all major x86 segments, helped by strong desktop growth driven by the halo effect of range-topping Ryzen 9000-series CPUs and Intel's struggles to ship enough previous-generation desktop CPUs, as well as the relatively low popularity of its latest offerings for desktops. As a result, AMD expanded its presence in client CPUs, reached a new high in desktops, and inched upward in servers, while Intel's share declined modestly as supply constraints and product transitions limited its ability to address all orders. Although Intel still led the market in total shipments, the balance continued shifting gradually toward AMD.</p><p>In terms of revenue, AMD delivered even stronger results, setting new highs in both desktop and server segments thanks to rising sales of premium processors and the ramp of its newest platforms. Intel's revenue performance was more mixed: constrained low-end supply pushed its average prices higher, but it ceded more of the high-margin market to AMD, especially in desktops and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/enterprise" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/enterprise">enterprise</a> servers.

<p><strong><em>A Python toolkit for hardware engineering</em></strong></p>
<p>By Jared Callaham • 6 Oct 2025</p>
<hr>
<p>A great engineer (controls being no exception) has to be part hacker, part master craftsman.</p>
<p>You have to be a hacker because things rarely “just work” in the real world without a little… creativity.
But you can’t <em>only</em> be a hacker; developing complex systems in aerospace, automotive, robotics, and similar industries demands a disciplined, systematic approach.
You need tools that let you iterate fast and maintain a methodical workflow where changes are version-controlled, algorithms are tested systematically, and deployment is repeatable.</p>
<p>Modern deep learning frameworks solved this years ago — you can develop in PyTorch or JAX and deploy anywhere.
But those tools were built for neural net models, GPUs, and cloud deployments, not dynamics models, MCUs, and HIL testing.</p>
<p>That’s where Archimedes comes in; what PyTorch did for ML deployment, Archimedes aims to do for control systems.
The goal is to build an open-source “PyTorch for hardware” that gives you the productivity of Python with the deployability of C.</p>
<p>In short, <strong>Archimedes is a Python framework that lets you develop and analyze algorithms in NumPy and automatically generate optimized C code for embedded systems</strong>.
For instance, you can write a physics model in Python, calibrate it with data, use the model to design and simulate control logic, validate with simple hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing, and deploy with confidence:</p>
<img alt="../../_images/dev_workflow.png" src="https://pinetreelabs.github.io/archimedes/_images/dev_workflow.png">
<img alt="../../_images/dev_workflow_dark.png" src="https://pinetreelabs.github.io/archimedes/_images/dev_workflow_dark.png">
<p>This is <em>one</em> workflow you might use with Archimedes (specifically, the one from the <a href="https://pinetreelabs.github.io/archimedes/tutorials/deployment/deployment00.html"><span>hardware deployment tutorial</span></a>), but it’s designed to be flexible, so you’re free to build up whatever workflow suits your style and application best.</p>
<section id="the-linchpin-python-c-code-generation">
<h2>The Linchpin: Python → C Code Generation<a href="#the-linchpin-python-c-code-generation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Archimedes started with the question, <strong>“What would you need to actually do practical control systems development in Python?”</strong></p>
<p>As a high-level language, it’s hard to beat Python on design principles like progressive disclosure, flexibility, and scalability.
The numerical ecosystem (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, PyTorch, etc.) is also excellent.
The problem is that <strong>none of it can deploy to typical embedded systems.</strong></p>
<p>If you need to deploy to hardware today, you have a few basic options:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Work in a high-level language like Python or Julia and manually translate algorithms to C code</p></li>
<li><p>Work entirely in a low-level language like C/C++ or Rust</p></li>
<li><p>Adopt an expensive vendor-locked ecosystem that supports automatic code generation</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(<strong>Side note</strong>: While running Python itself on a microcontroller is growing in popularity for educational and hobby applications, there’s no real future for pure Python in real-time mission-critical deployments.)</p>
<p>However, if you could do seamless C code generation from standard NumPy code, you could layer on simulation and optimization tools, building blocks for physics modeling, testing frameworks, and other features of comprehensive controls engineering toolchains.
But without the code generation, there will always be a gulf between the software and the hardware deployment.</p>
<p>Just to drive the point home, here’s a side-by-side of manual vs automatic coding for a common piece of sensor fusion algorithms:</p>
<details>
<div>
<p>Below are two implementations of a Kalman filter, an algorithm that combines noisy sensor measurements with a prediction model to estimate system state.
This is what’s behind GPS navigation, spacecraft guidance, and sensor fusion in millions of devices.</p>
<p>On the left is hand-written C code, and on the right is a NumPy version that can be used to generate an equivalent function.</p>
<p>Here we’ll show an implementation for the common case of a single sensor, which avoids having to use a library for matrix inversion in C (though Archimedes does support operations like Cholesky factorization).</p>

<p>Neither of these implementations is optimized, but it gives a sense of what it looks like to work in either environment.
Of course, for production hand-written code, you’d likely also use optimized linear algebra libraries like CMSIS-DSP and numerical strategies like Cholesky factorization or a square-root form for stability.
But the extra numerical features are only a few extra lines in NumPy, while the hand-written C version becomes more and more complex.</p>
</div>
</details><p>This capability, and most of the other core functionality in Archimedes, is made possible by building on <a href="https://web.casadi.org/">CasADi</a>, a sophisticated open-source library for nonlinear optimization and algorithmic differentiation.
This lets Archimedes translate your NumPy code into C++ <em>computational graphs</em> that support code generation, derivative calculation, and more.</p>

<section id="beyond-codegen">
<h2>Beyond Codegen<a href="#beyond-codegen" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you’re already working in C/C++/Rust, or if you don’t actually need to deploy to hardware for your application, the codegen may not speak to you.
But while Python → C code generation is what makes Archimedes practical for deployment, there’s much more you can do.</p>
<!--
Archimedes has a primarily _functional_ style, meaning that much of the core functionality is exposed through function _decorators_ that transform the function you wrote into a modified function according to the purpose of the decorator.

This design was heavily influenced by JAX and PyTorch, but don't worry if you haven't used these frameworks before.
-->
<section id="compilation">
<h3>Compilation<a href="#compilation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Archimedes can “compile” a Python function into a C++ <em>computational graph</em>, meaning that when you call the compiled function, the entire numerical code gets executed in C++ rather than interpreted Python.
For complicated functions this can achieve dramatic speedups over pure Python (5-10x even on simple benchmarks).</p>

<p>You can embed complex functionality like <a href="https://pinetreelabs.github.io/archimedes/generated/api/archimedes.odeint.html#archimedes.odeint" title="archimedes.odeint"><span>ODE solves</span></a>, <a href="https://pinetreelabs.github.io/archimedes/generated/api/archimedes.minimize.html#archimedes.minimize" title="archimedes.minimize"><span>constrained nonlinear optimization</span></a>, and more directly in these computational graphs.</p>
<p>When you first call your function, Archimedes feeds it <em>symbolic arrays</em> (using <a href="https://web.casadi.org/">CasADi’s</a> symbolic types under the hood) that match the shape and type of your numerical inputs.
As your code executes, it builds up a C++ representation of the calculation.
Then, instead of operating on the numerical arrays, your code operates on these symbolic replacements, using NumPy’s <em>array dispatch</em> mechanism to redirect to CasADi whenever you call NumPy functions.
By the end of this “tracing” step, CasADi has a full view of what the function does and can reproduce it in efficient C++.
Then, any time you call that function again, the C++ equivalent is what actually gets executed.</p>
<p>This approach is not “Just-In-Time” (JIT) compilation in the sense used by Julia/JAX/Numba, where the Python code is literally compiled down to highly optimized platform-specific machine code.
We’ll show some benchmarking in a separate post, but generally what you can expect is that these JIT-compiled frameworks will be somewhat faster than pre-compiled CasADi (and hence, Archimedes).
However, by avoiding the overhead and “unrolling” of true JIT compilation, we get a massive reduction in compilation time for the kind of complex functions typical of advanced controls applications.</p>
<p>For more on how this works (and when it doesn’t), see the <a href="https://pinetreelabs.github.io/archimedes/under-the-hood.html"><span>Under the Hood</span></a> documentation page.</p>

<h3>Automatic Differentiation<a href="#automatic-differentiation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Compilation into a CasADi computational graph unlocks two critical capabilities: execution speed and automatic differentiation.
This means that you can easily and accurately calculate derivatives of your functions:</p>

<p>Besides linearizing models for stability analysis and controller design, this is a feature you may not directly use very often.
But gradients and Jacobians are used pervasively in numerical methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Optimization</strong> solvers use gradients of the objective, Jacobians of the constraints, and sometimes even Hessian information</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simulation</strong> algorithms use Jacobians of the dynamics model for implicit solvers, especially for “stiff” ODE/DAE problems</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Root-finding</strong> solvers like Newton’s method use Jacobians at every iteration to find an improved guess at the solution point</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So when you do parameter estimation, trajectory optimization, trim point identification, or even just call <code><span>odeint</span></code>, you don’t <em>think</em> about “autodiff”, but it’s happening behind the scenes to solve your problem.</p>
<p>Traditional scientific computing packages like SciPy and MATLAB usually fall back to slow and inaccurate finite differencing unless you provide manually implemented gradients, Jacobians, etc. - but for anything but the simplest problems this is prohibitively complicated to calculate and implement.</p>
<p>Newer frameworks like Julia, JAX, and PyTorch rely much more heavily on autodiff, but none of these are tailored towards hardware and controls engineering applications.
My personal experience has been that CasADi (the autodiff framework used under the hood by Archimedes) has far and away the best autodiff system for the kinds of large, sparse problems that commonly arise in engineering (like parameter estimation, trajectory optimization, model-predictive control, etc.).</p>
<p>All that is to say, the derivatives are there if you need them.</p>

<section id="structured-data-types">
<h3>Structured Data Types<a href="#structured-data-types" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most numerical codes are naturally written to operate on flat vectors.
This makes sense for the implementation of an optimization algorithm or ODE solver, but physical systems are usually more naturally conceived of as hierarchical.
For instance, a satellite has position, velocity, attitude, angular velocity, battery state, thermal state, etc.
To work with typical numerical codes, you have to either keep track of what entries in your array are which physical state or manually flatten/unflatten every time you call a routine that expects a flat vector.</p>
<p>That might be fine the <em>first</em> time, but what if you want to try a higher-fidelity battery model that has twice as many dynamic states?
It quickly becomes a nightmare to maintain these kinds of codes, and the result is that you waste cycles on keeping all of this straight, and you lose the practical capability to explore multi-fidelity modeling.</p>
<p>This also comes up frequently in deep learning: models are naturally organized as hierarchical modules with trainable parameters.
This is the root of the <code><span>nn.Module</span></code> in PyTorch and the “PyTree” concept in JAX.
Modern ML frameworks (specifically JAX and PyTorch) have developed a nice set of solutions around working with this kind of hierarchically structured data.</p>
<p>But this hierarchical data and logic might even be <em>more</em> common in engineering.
Physical systems are naturally organized into subsystems and components that have well-defined interfaces, and each of these might have its own dynamic state and configurable parameters.
Hierarchical data structures can mirror this physical system decomposition.</p>
<p>Archimedes takes inspiration from these frameworks and supports “tree operations” (functions applied to hierarchical data) and a <a href="https://pinetreelabs.github.io/archimedes/generated/api/archimedes.struct.html#archimedes.struct" title="archimedes.struct"><span><code><span>@struct</span></code></span></a> decorator to create tree-compatible data classes:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>@arc</span><span>.</span><span>struct</span>
<span>class</span><span> </span><span>PointMass</span><span>:</span>
    <span>pos</span><span>:</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>ndarray</span>
    <span>vel</span><span>:</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>ndarray</span>

<span>state</span> <span>=</span> <span>PointMass</span><span>(</span><span>np</span><span>.</span><span>zeros</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>),</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>ones</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>))</span>  <span># state.pos, state.vel</span>
<span>flat_state</span><span>,</span> <span>unravel</span> <span>=</span> <span>arc</span><span>.</span><span>tree</span><span>.</span><span>ravel</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span>)</span>  <span># flat_state is a vector</span>
<span>state</span> <span>=</span> <span>unravel</span><span>(</span><span>flat_state</span><span>)</span>  <span># Back to a PointMass instance</span>
</pre></div>
<p>These <code><span>@struct</span></code>-decorated classes can be nested inside one another, flattened to/from a 1D vector, and used to auto-generate nested <code><span>struct</span></code> types in deployable C code.
If a <code><span>PointMass</span></code> is used as an argument to a codegen function, it will become:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span><span> </span><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>float</span><span> </span><span>pos</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>];</span>
<span>    </span><span>float</span><span> </span><span>vel</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span><span> </span><span>point_mass_t</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This gives you a predictable and intuitive way to switch back and forth between Python and auto-generated C.</p>

<section id="why-another-framework">
<h2>Why Another Framework?<a href="#why-another-framework" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are lots of modeling and simulation tools out there, from rock-solid commercial tools building on 30-year legacies to innovative modern frameworks experimenting with new languages, JIT-compilation, and physics-informed ML.</p>
<p>I created Archimedes because none of these really solved the problems I was having in my own work.
Codebases that started out being logical and well-organized invariably ended up growing into a gnarled, difficult-to-maintain mass in order to support increasingly complex models and analyses.
Then when it’s time to move towards testing and production, you’re back to square one to translate to C code.</p>
<p>Granted, these complaints might just indicate that I’m not a great software developer - but I’m <em>not</em> a software developer.
That’s the point.
I wanted a framework that would let me write code that looked as clean as a deep learning repository in PyTorch, but would also be high-performance for simulation and optimization, <em>and</em> had a path to hardware deployment.
After seeing it perform in my own work, I’m convinced this approach - NumPy-based development with automatic C deployment - could help how control systems engineers develop and deploy algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>One last comment</strong>: from personal experience, it takes a little time (but maybe less than you think) to grok the functional programming and hierarchical data types that are core to Archimedes.
(I’ve spent a lot of time in JAX, which heavily influenced the design of this library.)
It’s different than what you might be used to, and there are also some <a href="https://pinetreelabs.github.io/archimedes/gotchas.html"><span>quirks and gotchas</span></a> related to compilation and control flow.</p>
<p>But these concepts do actually map quite neatly to our mental/mathematical models for dynamical systems and control algorithms.
Once it clicks, you’ll be able to write clean, modular, maintainable workflows that cut down your iteration time and make it faster to design, debug, deploy, and debug, and debug, and redesign, and debug, and…</p>

<section id="public-beta-status">
<h3>“Public Beta” Status<a href="#public-beta-status" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This post marks the release of Archimedes in “public beta” (v0.X.X).
This means that the core functionality is there and has already been tested in practical applications.
The API is also well-tested and stable; while it is likely to evolve in time, it will change with semantic versioning conventions, meaning smooth upgrade paths and deprecation notices.
The library will remain in beta for 6-12 months to allow for community feedback and API maturation across ongoing real-world applications.</p>
<p>For symbolic/numeric reliability in particular, Archimedes gets a big leg up by using CasADi as its backend, which has an excellent track record and is widely and actively used and tested in a variety of applications.</p>
<p>All that is to say, between now and the “v1.0” release you can expect things to be largely stable, but this additional time builds in a cushion to work out any kinks.</p>
<p>Ongoing development priorities are outlined in detail in the <a href="https://pinetreelabs.github.io/archimedes/roadmap.html"><span>roadmap</span></a>, but key focus areas include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Hybrid Simulations</strong>: Support for DAEs, zero-crossing events, multirate control logic</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hardware Deployment</strong>: Improved support for HIL testing, static analysis, and profiling/telemetry</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Physics Modeling</strong>: Built-in functionality like reference frames, kinematic trees, polynomial/spline primitives, and templates for domain-specific components.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Algorithm Development</strong>: State machines, trajectory optimization, MPC, sensor fusion, uncertainty quantification, etc.</p></li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>On May 28, hours after Nevada’s workplace safety agency served notice of more than $400,000 in fines to Elon Musk’s $5.6 billion tunneling startup the Boring Company, the phone rang at Nevada governor Joe Lombardo’s office.&nbsp;</p><div>



<p>Boring Co. president Steve Davis was on the line. Boring Company was challenging citations from Nevada’s workplace safety regulator blaming it for chemical burns two firefighters had suffered in its tunnels during a training exercise.&nbsp;



</p><p>By the next afternoon, a group of high-ranking state officials, including the governor’s state infrastructure coordinator who took the call, were convened in a room with Davis, who was himself wrapping up a stint in Washington D.C. helping Musk run the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). At the beginning of that meeting, the citations and fines—among the agency’s largest in a decade and a potential threat to Boring’s plans to build tunnels in other U.S. cities—were summarily rescinded.&nbsp;



</p><p>Soon, something else disappeared: The record of the Governor’s office meeting with Musk’s company was removed from a public document without explanation. More irregularities in the case file occurred: Documents weren’t saved to the file, and a document intended to provide reasoning for revoking the citations was left out.&nbsp;



</p><p>The sequence of events, which <em>Fortune</em> is the first to report, raised alarm and has had a chilling effect within Nevada’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, according to an OSHA staffer as well as someone who worked on the case, and it raises questions about the degree to which a powerful business is able to bend regulatory guardrails to its will and skirt proper oversight, especially as Musk’s consortium of companies become increasingly intertwined with Nevada’s economy.</p><p>“There is a defined process, and we didn’t follow it,” says one of the people that worked on the case file. “It wasn’t the agency that decided to do that—it was above the agency,” the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation from speaking about internal OSHA matters.



</p><p>In statements to <em>Fortune</em>, Teri Williams, a spokeswoman for Nevada OSHA and the state departments that sit above it, described most of the irregularities in public record documentation of the case as innocuous mistakes, and said the agency had amended its case file after <em>Fortune</em>’s outreach “to ensure that the file is accurate.” She said the citations and fines did not meet legal requirements and should never have been issued in the first place, and that, as a result of this incident, the agency has since updated its policies and procedures to provide more oversight of OSHA investigations into “high-profile” employers.&nbsp;



</p><p>Regarding the meeting, Williams said that the Governor’s office “frequently receives complaints and inquiries” from employers and that “it is standard practice” for the Governor’s office to reach out to leadership to assist with complaints and inquiries. She said that the Governor’s office has never directed Nevada agencies to resolve complaints and that, in this instance, it would have supported an agency decision to keep citations if they were “found to have merit and could be validated.”&nbsp;&nbsp;



</p><p>“This specific outreach from Boring Company is not an anomaly and only stands out due to the high-profile nature of the business because of its affiliation with Elon Musk,” she said. (To read Nevada’s OSHA entire response to this story, <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/11/12/fortune-investigation-boring-co-las-vegas-workplace-injuries-citations-rescinded-nevada-osha-responses" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/11/12/fortune-investigation-boring-co-las-vegas-workplace-injuries-citations-rescinded-nevada-osha-responses">click here.</a>)



</p><p>Four lawyers and former Nevada regulators, however, say this level of political involvement in an OSHA investigation is not only highly unusual, but goes against procedure. “It’s absolutely not appropriate,” said Jess Lankford, who oversaw Nevada OSHA until 2021. The agency is supposed to have the political independence to call “balls and strikes” as it sees fit, says Terry Johnson, an adjunct professor at the University of Nevada Las Vegas who previously served as the director of the department that sits above OSHA.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>“It’s absolutely not appropriate.”<cite>Jess Lankford, Chief Administrative Officer of Nevada OSHA until 2021 </cite></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The Boring Company’s project, which aims to build an 104-station network of underground tunnels connecting the Convention Center to the airport, the Las Vegas Strip, and Allegiant Stadium, is one of several major investments that Elon Musk has made in Nevada, including the $7 billion <a href="https://fortune.com/company/tesla/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/tesla/">Tesla</a> Gigafactory, which employs more than 17,000 construction and factory workers and has drawn other partner companies to set up shop nearby.&nbsp;



</p><p>As the fallout from the closed investigation has been quietly playing out behind the scenes, more safety incidents have occurred on Boring project sites in Las Vegas, under what one recently departed employee described as a “cowboy” culture regarding safety protocols. A worker’s pelvis was <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/09/11/boring-company-job-site-injury-reported-safety/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/09/11/boring-company-job-site-injury-reported-safety/">crushed</a> in September; a different employee was shocked by an electrical panel this summer; and the harsh chemicals that burned the firefighters, part of a toxic muck fluid that pools in the tunnels, remain an ever-present danger for Boring workers, according to five current and former employees at the Boring Company, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared retribution.&nbsp;



</p><p>One former employee described how workers would often kneel in the muck, not even realizing they were being burned until it was happening. “They go to peel off their sock,” they said, “And a big old chunk of skin comes off.”&nbsp;



</p><p>Meanwhile, a current Nevada OSHA employee says that the OSHA staffers working on the agency’s ongoing investigations into Boring (one of which involves the crushed worker) are frightened they will “get disciplined for doing their job.”</p><p>“It’s very political right now,” they added.&nbsp;



</p><p>This account of the firefighter injuries in Boring Co. tunnels, the Governor’s office involvement, and the aborted penalties is based on interviews with and statements from Nevada regulators and current or former Nevada OSHA employees, interviews with current and former Boring Co. employees, analysis from attorneys practicing in Nevada, and hundreds of pages of documents, including calendars, emails, photographs, and notes, related to OSHA’s inspection that were either obtained via several Freedom of Information Act Requests or shared privately with <em>Fortune</em>.&nbsp;



</p><p>Boring Company and Davis did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.&nbsp;



</p><h2><strong>A fire drill gone awry&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Musk’s Boring Co. bills itself as a new kind of transportation system, with ambitions to dig a vast “underground highway” for Teslas to zip through under the streets of Las Vegas, Nashville, and eventually other cities.

<p>Building the underground Tesla system is grueling work in the best of cases—involving giant drilling machines, toxic chemicals, and long shifts. At Boring Co. safety precautions and environmental permits have seemingly been thrown to the side in favor of speed. A <em>Fortune</em> <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/flirted-death-elon-musk-boring-company-employees-injuries-osha-citations/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/flirted-death-elon-musk-boring-company-employees-injuries-osha-citations/">investigation</a> published in early 2024 <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/flirted-death-elon-musk-boring-company-employees-injuries-osha-citations/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/flirted-death-elon-musk-boring-company-employees-injuries-osha-citations/">found</a> that numerous employees had suffered from burns caused by an accelerant used to harden the concrete mixture that keeps the tunnel structure in place. That chemical, called MasterRoc AGA 41S, mixes with groundwater and dirt as the tunneling proceeds, and pools at the base of the tunnels, sometimes to knee-high levels.&nbsp;



</p><p>So when the Clark County fire department began to familiarize itself with the tunnel network to conduct emergency rescue drills at the end of 2024, the question of how to deal with the muck was part of the planning process, according to planning documents reviewed by <em>Fortune</em>. Boring was slated to brief firefighters on the muck fluid before each day of the December safety drills.&nbsp;



</p><p>Preparation for the two-day fire drill began more than a month beforehand. Scripts about the hypothetical accident and evacuation were put together, five prep meetings were held, and the Fire Department stowed an approximately 200-pound mannequin dummy in a hard-to-reach location within the tunnel, so the technical rescue team could simulate an arduous evacuation, according to planning materials, documents Boring Company shared with OSHA, and the Fire Department’s subsequent review of the drills that were shared with <em>Fortune</em>.&nbsp;



</p><p>Approximately thirteen fire units arrived for the drill on December 9, parking around the training site and at the Centerfolds strip club down the street.



</p><p>The first day went as planned, but it was right after the drill on the second day, December 10, 2024, that complications ensued. After two hours in the tunnels, two firefighters reported irritation on their legs. They were taken to the hospital, where it was determined that their legs had been burned by the chemicals in Boring’s tunnel. The firefighters’ skin was permanently scarred, according to findings from the subsequent OSHA investigation, though they left the hospital later that same day and were back at work the next work shift, which was two days later, a spokeswoman for the County Fire Department says.&nbsp;</p><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 60vw, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 33vw" srcset="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=128&amp;q=85 128w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=256&amp;q=85 256w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=320&amp;q=85 320w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=384&amp;q=85 384w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=480&amp;q=85 480w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=576&amp;q=85 576w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=768&amp;q=85 768w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=1024&amp;q=85 1024w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=1280&amp;q=85 1280w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=1440&amp;q=85 1440w" src="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=1440&amp;q=85"></p><figcaption>After two hours in the tunnels, two firefighters reported irritation on their legs and were taken to the hospital.

<p>OSHA’s investigator interviewed four firefighters who were at the drill, according to notes from the interviews obtained by <em>Fortune</em> in a records request (the names of the firefighters were redacted). Three of the firefighters said that the muck fluid reached the top of their boots or above, and one of the firefighters who was burned said they had to crawl through it at one point to rescue the dummy, according to the notes. “My boots were full of muck,” they said.



</p><p>Some of the firefighters appeared not to have been aware of the risk, the notes show. “We weren’t aware of the chemicals being hazardous,” one firefighter said, according to the notes, pointing out that Boring Company had supposedly told them “we could just wash it off after” and that it was “just mud.” Another firefighter reported that the Boring Company “had someone put their full arm in the muck” and tell them “they’d be fine.”&nbsp;



</p><p>According to one former Boring employee who worked at the company at the time of the drills, workers had made an effort to clear the tunnels of the muck fluid before the fire department arrived for the exercise. “There’s no way to fully clean it,” the employee said, “Because there’s constant flow coming out of the machine, even when it’s standing still.”&nbsp;



</p><p>“We’re so used to dealing with it on a daily basis,” they added.&nbsp;

<p>Shortly after Nevada’s OSHA opened an investigation, Boring Company’s lawyers put together a response in which Boring denied any responsibility and placed full blame for the incident on the Clark County Fire Department. “The key breakdowns in the Training Plan were committed by CCFD employees, not TBC employees,” the company’s lawyer wrote in the letter. (The Fire Department maintains that “CCFD followed all recommendations from TBC” and says that OSHA found no fault with the Fire Department for the incident) In the response, Boring Company provided nearly 1,000 pages of documents that OSHA had requested, including receipts of equipment and protective gear it had purchased as well as documentation showing it had debriefed the Fire Department on the chemicals, performed safety meetings prior to the drills, and offered the use of a liner truck to transport the firefighters through the tunnel.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevada OSHA came to a different conclusion. On May 28, OSHA issued three “willful” citations against Boring. These are the most aggressive violations the agency can levy, reserved for an employer that committed an “intentional and knowing” violation or knew that a hazardous condition existed and made no “reasonable effort” to eliminate it. All three citations were categorized as “serious,” meaning there was a “substantial probability that death or serious physical harm” could have occurred.&nbsp;



</p><figure><blockquote><p>“We’re so used to dealing with it on a daily basis.”<cite>former Boring Company employee</cite></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>OSHA proposed penalties of $425,595 for the three citations, according to the citation notice sent to Boring Company. That may not sound like much for a company <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/elon-r-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/elon-r-musk/">owned by the world’s richest man</a>, but it would have been the third-largest initial penalty Nevada OSHA had issued to an employer since 2015, according to a <a href="https://www.osha.gov/enforcement/toppenalties" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.osha.gov/enforcement/toppenalties">public database</a> of enforcement actions that the Department of Labor keeps on its website. The median initial penalty Nevada OSHA issued in the first six months of this year was $5,142, according to OSHA.&nbsp;



</p><p>A fine of that size could also have been a public black eye for the company at a time when it was pushing to expand in Las Vegas and <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/news/2025/07/18/tennessee-boring-co-nashville-airport-tunnel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/news/2025/07/18/tennessee-boring-co-nashville-airport-tunnel.html">win business in other cities</a>.&nbsp;



</p><h2><strong>‘Not the way it’s supposed to work’</strong></h2>



<p>When Boring Co.’s Davis called the Governor’s office the day the company received the citations, he spoke to Chris Reilly, the governor’s point person for state infrastructure, who was hired in 2024 after working at Tesla for more than seven years.&nbsp;</p><p>The next day, May 29, at 4 p.m. a coterie of high-level Nevada officials gathered to meet with a handful of Boring executives, including Davis and Tyler Fairbanks, head of project development at Boring Co., according to a copy of the meeting invite, calendar records, and independent verification by <em>Fortune</em>. The Nevada government attendees included Reilly; Dr. Kristopher Sanchez, the Governor Lombardo-appointed director of the Department of Business and Industry (DBI); as well as supervisory staff from the Division of Industry Relations (DIR), which oversees Nevada OSHA; Nevada OSHA itself, and a representative from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. (Governor Lombardo himself was not present, and was reviewing legislation at the time, according to a copy of his calendar that <em>Fortune</em> received in a records request.)



</p><p>Boring Co. had prepared a 25-page slide deck for the meeting that echoed its previous arguments and called the citations “patently absurd” and “demonstrably false.” Before the company laid out its case in the meeting, however, Nevada OSHA had already withdrawn the citations, and state officials kicked off the meeting by telling Boring Co. they had been rescinded, Nevada’s OSHA confirmed in a statement to <em>Fortune.</em> “No information provided during the meeting was the basis for the citations being withdrawn,” OSHA’s Williams said in an email.



</p><p>In an interview, Victoria Carreón, the Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations, which oversees Nevada OSHA, who was also in the meeting, said that the concerns Boring raised to the Governor’s office had led Nevada OSHA’s legal counsel to go back and review the citations ahead of the meeting.



</p><p>The state’s lawyers determined the key elements for a citation were not met and so “we decided that the best course of action was to withdraw the citation pending further review,” she said, noting that the subsequent review found that the “particular citations that were originally composed were not warranted to be reissued.”



</p><p>Reilly, the state infrastructure coordinator in Lombardo’s office, added in a statement that, in the May 29 meeting, representatives from OSHA and the Division of Industrial Relations had shared that the violations were issued without proper internal documentation, failed to consider materials previously submitted by the company refuting the violations, and “should not have been sent.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>“We decided that the best course of action was to withdraw the citation pending further review.”<cite>Victoria Carreón, Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations</cite></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Nevada OSHA’s <a href="https://dir.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/dirnvgov/content/Governance/NOM%20%28April%202023%29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://dir.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/dirnvgov/content/Governance/NOM%20%28April%202023%29.pdf">official procedures</a> allow for an appeals process where companies can object to the citations, in writing, and set up an informal meeting with OSHA to ask for the penalties to be modified or even withdrawn. Once the governor’s office was looped in however, none of this ever happened.&nbsp;



</p><p>Multiple sources, including current and former Nevada OSHA employees, regulators, and employment lawyers, told <em>Fortune</em> that it’s inappropriate for the Governor’s office and political appointees to get involved in a specific OSHA inspection—even one involving a high-profile company. Jess Lankford, the former Nevada OSHA chief administrative officer, said the Governor’s office getting involved is “not the way it’s supposed to work.”&nbsp;



</p><h2>Irregularities in the public record and special treatment for ‘large employers’</h2>



<p>Several of the things that happened next were, even by OSHA’s admission, inconsistent with the agency’s standard process and norms. After the May 29 meeting, the three now-rescinded citations against Boring Co.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>were never mentioned again in the&nbsp;OSHA case file,&nbsp;even though documentation of their removal should have&nbsp;appeared&nbsp;in the public record, according to&nbsp;<em>Fortune</em>’s review of the case file. No document was added to the file explaining or justifying their removal. “There are various missing documents, processes that weren’t followed. So we know that the policies, the procedures, were not being followed,” Nevada OSHA’s Williams acknowledged on a call with&nbsp;<em>Fortune</em>.



</p><p>Moreover, a key document in OSHA’s Boring Company inspection file was altered, according to two people with knowledge of the matter and documents seen by <em>Fortune</em>. A line in the OSHA case diary—the only reference in the case file to a meeting with the Governor’s office—was deleted, the people said. <em>Fortune</em> compared the public record it received from OSHA to an earlier version obtained from sources that had been available to all agency staff on its server, and confirmed that the line item documenting the meeting had been deleted from the case diary.</p><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 60vw, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 33vw" srcset="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=128&amp;q=85 128w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=256&amp;q=85 256w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=320&amp;q=85 320w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=384&amp;q=85 384w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=480&amp;q=85 480w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=576&amp;q=85 576w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=768&amp;q=85 768w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=1024&amp;q=85 1024w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=1280&amp;q=85 1280w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=1440&amp;q=85 1440w" src="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=1440&amp;q=85"></p><figcaption>Nevada OSHA includes a “case diary” in the case file, which documents step-by-step the progress of the case. An entry was included in the case diary, outlining that a meeting with Boring Company had taken place with OSHA, the Director’s Office, and the Governor’s Office on May 29, according to an early version of the case diary that was reviewed by Fortune. The below document, which was the document shared with Fortune as part of its records request, shows that the line item about the meeting was removed.</figcaption></div>



<p>“You have substantial evidence that shows there was, I’m not going to use the word illegal, but there was some questionable practices right there, having that removed,” said Lankford, the former OSHA chief administrative officer.&nbsp;



</p><p>“From an attorney’s standpoint, it looks really bad,” said Ron Zambrano, the employment litigation chair at West Coast Trial Lawyers, which represents plaintiff-side clients in California and Nevada. “You did something very unusual with this embarrassing thing, which is try to hide it,” he added.



</p><p>The case file included other discrepancies, including an incorrect date on a key document, missing worksheets detailing the rationale behind the citations that Nevada OSHA said were “apparently not saved into the file”, and another document that was “inadvertently omitted.”



</p><p>Regarding the deleted entry for the Governor’s office meeting, officials did not contest that the line item had been deleted, but emphasized that no supervisors had directed its deletion.&nbsp;



</p><p>Reilly, from Governor Lombardo’s office, said that “no record was edited at the direction of me, the Governor’s Office, DIR, B&amp;I, or any other entity I am aware of,” adding that the “insinuation” that these officers had directed such a deletion was “incorrect.” Nevada OSHA spokeswoman Williams also disputed that Nevada agencies had tried to conceal the meeting and said they were forthcoming about the meeting to <em>Fortune</em>.</p><p>Nevada OSHA updated the case file after <em>Fortune</em>’s inquiries, and shared a new copy of the case diary, in which there is now an update at the bottom, describing a May 29 “collaborative meeting w/ employer” in which Boring Company was told “OSHA was withdrawing the citation.” The case diary still no longer mentions that representatives from the Governor’s office were present.

</p><p>Meanwhile, the state has revised its OSHA policies in ways that could ultimately make it more difficult or take longer for the agency to impose such fines on larger employers like the Boring Co. Carreón, the DIR Administrator, said her agency conducted a “quality review process” after the Boring case, and implemented new policies and new procedures. Among them is a mandatory 30-day lawyer review period and notification to the Public Information Officer in “high-profile” or “large-scale employer” cases. The goal, Carreón said, is to improve the quality of Nevada OSHA case files and make sure that what was included in them would be “legally sufficient.”



</p><p>Williams stressed that OSHA employees have been assured that they have “full support” from DBI and DIR “to do their job in [a] way that ensures Nevada employees have access to a safe, healthful workplace, and businesses have confidence that the agency will regulate them in a fair and impartial manner.”&nbsp;



</p><p>Boring ended up making a few concessions with OSHA, which included monthly “update” meetings with the chief administrative officer (CAO) of Nevada OSHA. But the CAO, William Gardner, who held that role when the original citations were issued against Boring, left in July, and Carreón acknowledged that the meetings have not been taking place monthly.&nbsp;

<h2><strong>‘They won’t make sh*t safe for us’</strong></h2>



<p>In the tunnels below Las Vegas, the mission to construct the subterranean highway system continues. Three current and former Boring Co. employees, who have all worked at the company this year, say that pressure to speed up the project has heightened since June—when Steve Davis returned to his day-to-day role at the company after his brief stint helping Musk run DOGE. That month—just after the citations had been issued, then retracted—employees started seeing Davis around again. Three employees who worked at Boring in June said they would see Davis being whisked to and from various project sites, escorted by an armed bodyguard in a Cadillac Escalade.&nbsp;</p><p>Five current and former Boring employees who spoke with <em>Fortune</em> say the same safety issues persist, with two reporting that chemical burns seem to happen “daily.” When asked to describe safety protocols and training, one employee who left in recent weeks put it simply: “There is none.”&nbsp;



</p><p>“PPE has been provided to the Boring Company workers as well as the firefighters. Accelerant is an integral part of the process and will continue to be used. The Boring Company is working to limit workers’ exposure and is making progress, but properly used PPE remains the correct way for employees to protect themselves,” says a spokeswoman from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, the government marketing agency that pays Boring Company to operate the tunnel system below the Convention Center and has overseen the initial project construction.



</p><p>Within Nevada’s workplace safety watchdog agency, meanwhile, the unusual reversal of the citations is having ripple effects. Two staffers say they were alarmed by the handling of the incident and the speed at which the citations were withdrawn, and that these actions have made agency employees fear inspecting or regulating Boring Co. in the future, particularly because two employees that worked on the Boring Co. investigation were demoted or written up (Williams said Nevada OSHA wouldn’t comment on “specific personnel actions taken in this case or any other.”) One of the people who worked on the case said that they and many colleagues worried that the agency’s ability to independently enforce safe working conditions and accountability had been compromised in order to appease one of Nevada’s (and the world’s) most high-profile business magnates.

<p>The events may even have <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/11/08/boring-company-drilling-fluid-fine-wastewater-elon-musk/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/11/08/boring-company-drilling-fluid-fine-wastewater-elon-musk/">emboldened</a> Boring Company in its interactions with regulators. In mid-August, Clark County’s environmental regulators allege, Boring workers refused to stop dumping wastewater down manholes around Las Vegas and later “feigned compliance” and made false statements to inspectors about when the dumping had started, according to documents sent to Boring Company from the Clark County Water Reclamation District. The episode ended up causing “substantial damage” to the broader county infrastructure, and the regulator fined Boring Company nearly $500,000, the documents show. (Boring has not responded to <em>Fortune</em>’s multiple requests for comment on the matter)</p><p>To date, Boring has never paid a penalty to Nevada OSHA for any safety incidents on its job sites. The company is still contesting eight citations issued in 2023 by Nevada OSHA. As Boring Co. has plowed ahead, Nevada OSHA has been one of the few checks on its practices. But the events of this spring have led some to call into question OSHA’s willingness or ability to wield its own authority.



</p><p>For those underground, digging the tunnels, a perceived lack of consequence has sent a clear message:&nbsp; “It seems like people are going to have to die, because they won’t make sh*t safe for us,” one current Boring employee says.

      <p>The ability to recognize and avoid pathogens is essential for survival. In some cases, animals recognize molecules produced by pathogens, allowing them to mount an immediate response. In other cases, animals learn to avoid the pathogen after they have been exposed to it – a phenomenon that is called “learned avoidance”.</p>
<p>The worm <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> can learn to avoid <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, a pathogenic bacterium that causes disease in a range of species (<a href="#bib7">Zhang et al., 2005</a>). In 2019, Coleen Murphy and colleagues at Princeton University observed that learned avoidance of the PA14 strain of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> could be transmitted for up to four generations of <i>C. elegans</i> without new exposure to PA14 (<a href="#bib6">Moore et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib3">Kaletsky et al., 2020</a>). This transgenerational epigenetic inheritance allows animals that have never encountered PA14 to benefit from the experiences of previous generations.</p>
<p>Recently, Craig Hunter and colleagues at Harvard University questioned the inheritance of learned avoidance to the F2 generation (<a href="#bib2">Gainey et al., 2025</a>). While they observed learned avoidance to PA14 in parents (P0) and their progeny (F1), they did not observe avoidance in the F2 generation. The Murphy group responded, contending that the inability to observe transgenerational epigenetic inheritance was due to changes the Hunter group made to the original experimental protocols (<a href="#bib4">Kaletsky et al., 2025</a>). Now, in eLife, Andres Vidal-Gadea and colleagues at Illinois State University – Aalimah Akinosho, Joseph Alexander and Kyle Floyd – report that they have confirmed findings from the Murphy group by showing that learned avoidance of PA14 is passed on to the F2 generation (<a href="#bib1">Akinosho et al., 2025</a>).</p>
<p>In a standard avoidance assay, test spots of bacteria are placed at opposite ends of an agar plate, and sodium azide – a chemical that immobilizes worms – is added to each test spot (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). The worms are placed at the center of the plate and allowed to roam, and the number of worms in proximity to each test spot is scored after one hour (<a href="#bib6">Moore et al., 2019</a>).</p>

                <p>An avoidance assay (top row) measures the ability of <i>C. elegans</i> worms to avoid specific bacteria. The worms are first grown on OP50 (orange; top left), a non-pathogenic strain of the bacterium <i>E. coli</i> that is the standard laboratory diet of <i>C. elegans,</i> before transfering them to a test plate. Spots of each bacterium are placed at opposite ends of a petri dish (top right), the worms are allowed to roam, and their position after a set period of time is recorded. When worms grown on OP50 encounter the pathogenic PA14 strain of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (green) for the first time, they are initially attracted to it (top right). However, when worms are exposed to PA14 before the avoidance assay, they avoid PA14 during the assay (second row). This learned avoidance can be passed on to the next generation (F1; third row) and the generation after that (F2; fourth row), without these worms needing to encounter PA14.</p>
          
          
              </figcaption>

    </div>
<p>For the learned avoidance assay, the worms are exposed to PA14 for 24 hours, a process sometimes called “training”, after which time they are collected and washed. A subset of these worms is transferred to a test plate and allowed to choose between PA14 and the OP50 strain of <i>E. coli</i> (which is the standard laboratory diet of <i>C. elegans</i>). This is the parental generation, and the worms in it will avoid PA14.</p>
<p>Eggs (F1) are collected from the remaining worms and transferred to standard OP50 plates. Once they reach the adult stage, the same process is carried out; a subset of animals is tested, and eggs are collected from the remaining worms for the next generation (F2). Importantly, after the parental generation, worms do not encounter PA14 before testing, but they retain the learned avoidance of the parental generation. To measure learned avoidance, all groups are compared to animals whose predecessors have never encountered PA14.</p>
<p>Both the Murphy and Vidal-Gadea groups used sodium azide in their assays to immobilize the worms, while the Hunter group immobilized them by lowering the temperature to 4 °C at the end of the assay. With azide, worms that reach the test spots before the end of the assay are immobilized. By contrast, when the temperature shift method is used, worms can come into contact with the test spots and then move away before the end of the assay. The Murphy group proposed that the use of azide ensured that animals were captured in their initial response, which prevented them from learning to avoid PA14 after encountering it during the assay. However, they argued, when the temperature-shift method is used, worms can encounter PA14, learn from this encounter, and avoid the PA14 spot (<a href="#bib4">Kaletsky et al., 2025</a>). Put simply, an encounter with PA14 could unintentionally introduce another source of learned avoidance to the assay. The most significant impact of this would be on the negative control, where it is assumed that the worms’ response reflects that of animals that have never encountered PA14.</p>
<p>Worms that have not previously encountered PA14 are initially attracted to it (<a href="#bib7">Zhang et al., 2005</a>). While the Murphy group consistently observed this attraction in their assays, the Hunter group generally did not (<a href="#bib4">Kaletsky et al., 2025</a>). The Vidal-Gadea group also observed that worms that had not been exposed to PA14 were initially attracted to it, suggesting that this is an important piece of the puzzle (<a href="#bib1">Akinosho et al., 2025</a>). Indeed, when tested directly, the Murphy group did not observe attraction using the temperature-shift method (<a href="#bib4">Kaletsky et al., 2025</a>). However, whether the omission of azide alone explains the discrepancy between the studies is not clear. In a handful of assays, the Hunter group used azide but failed to see the initial attraction to PA14, or to observe learned avoidance in the F2 generation.</p>
<p>P11, a small RNA produced by PA14, is necessary and sufficient to induce transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (<a href="#bib3">Kaletsky et al., 2020</a>). In addition, loss of P11 reduces chemoattraction to PA14 by reducing ammonia production (<a href="#bib5">Marogi et al., 2024</a>). The Murphy lab proposed that suboptimal P11 expression could explain difficulties in reproducing transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and in observing the initial attraction to PA14. Although they did not measure P11 levels, the Hunter group argued that their ability to observe learned avoidance in the F1 generation excluded the possibility that P11 expression was insufficient. PA14 growth conditions can alter P11 expression (<a href="#bib4">Kaletsky et al., 2025</a>), but whether low levels of P11 could permit F1 inheritance but not F2, is unknown.</p>
<p>Behavioral assays are notoriously finicky, not because they measure effects that are not robust, but because <i>C. elegans</i> are highly attuned to their environments; they integrate a myriad of environmental signals into an appropriate response. Hunter and colleagues tested potential sources of variability in the laboratory environment, including the sources of bacterial and worm strains, but none of these explained the discrepancy in their findings. The sources of variability identified by the Murphy lab (<a href="#bib4">Kaletsky et al., 2025</a>) provide a logical explanation for the differences between the two studies, but other unidentified environmental or procedural differences may also have contributed. The results of the Vidal-Gadea group, therefore, represent an important validation of the work of the Murphy group, and support the idea that procedural modifications made by the Hunter group contributed to their inability to observe transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.</p>
