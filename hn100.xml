            <div><p><img width="500" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/speedtest-graph-att-dropoff.png" alt="AT&amp;T Fiber Internet - speedtest graph"></p>

<p>About a week ago, my home Internet (AT&amp;T Fiber) went from the ~1 Gbps I pay for down to about 100 Mbps (<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/monitor-your-internet-raspberry-pi">see how I monitor my home Internet with a Pi</a>). It wasn't too inconvenient, and I considered waiting it out to see if the speed recovered at some point, because latency was fine.</p>

<p>But as you can see around 7/7 on that graph, the 100 Mbps went down to about <em>eight</em>, and that's the point where my wife starts noticing how slow the Internet is. Action level.</p>

<p>So I fired up AT&amp;T's support chat. I'm a programmer, I can usually find ways around the wily ways of chatbots.</p>

<p>Except AT&amp;T's AI-powered chatbot seems to have a fiendish tendency to equate 'WiFi' with 'Internet', no doubt due to so many people thinking they are one and the same.</p>

<p><img width="500" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/att-chatbot-slow-internet-not-wifi.png" alt="ATT Chatbot - Slow Internet not WiFi"></p>

<p>We were stuck in that loop for about 5 minutes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It looks like you're having trouble with your WiFi.</p>
  
  <p><em>No.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After working a few different angles, I finally 'spammed 0'<sup id="fnref:olddays"><a href="#fn:olddays" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> by entering some variation of 'connect me to a support rep'.</p>

<p><img width="300" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/att-chatbot-connect-to-support-rep.png" alt="ATT Chatbot - connect me to support rep"></p>

<p>I'll cut to the chase—after repeating some variation of that about 8 times, eventually I got queued up in the 20 minute line to a human support rep.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me, the human support rep, like so many in the industry, promptly ignored the data I provided in my first chat message to him<sup id="fnref:message"><a href="#fn:message" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and told me switching WiFi channels on the device (on which WiFi is currently disabled completely) would solve my issue. <em>At no cost.</em></p>

<p><img width="300" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/att-chat-support-wifi.png" alt="ATT Support Rep - WiFi is not the problem"></p>

<p>Maybe I should welcome our AI overlords?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>When parents are asked to identify their top fears about the safety of their children, what do you think tops the list? According to a survey last year by </span><a href="https://www.safehome.org/family-safety/parenting-in-america-report/" rel="">Safehome.org</a><span>, it’s not cars, strangers, or any other physical threat; it’s “internet/social media.” That’s not just for parents of teenagers and pre-teens, whose lives seem to revolve around their phones. It’s even true for parents of younger kids, ages 7-9 because every parent sees it coming and few know what to do about it. Parents don’t want their children to disappear into phones, as so many of their friends' children have; some resolve to </span><a href="https://www.waituntil8th.org/" rel="">wait until 8th grade</a><span>, or later. Then their child hits them with the main argument that makes parents buckle: “But everyone else has a phone, so I’m being left out.”</span></p><p><span>For parents who resisted, or who plan to resist, a new report may encourage many more parents to join you: </span><a href="https://sapienlabs.org/" rel="">Sapien Labs</a><span>, which runs an </span><a href="https://sapienlabs.org/global-mind-project/" rel="">ongoing global survey</a><span> of mental health with nearly a million participants so far, </span><a href="https://sapienlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Sapien-Labs-Age-of-First-Smartphone-and-Mental-Wellbeing-Outcomes.pdf" rel="">released a “Rapid Report” today</a><span> on a question they added in January asking young adults (those between ages 18 and 24): </span><em>“At what age did you get your own smartphone or tablet (e.g. iPad) with Internet access that you could carry with you?”</em><span>&nbsp; When they plot the age of first smartphone on the X axis against their extensive set of questions about mental health on the Y axis, they find a consistent pattern: </span><em>the younger the age of getting the first smartphone, the worse the mental health that the young adult reports today.</em><span> This is true in all the regions studied (the survey is offered in English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Arabic, Hindi, and Swahili), and the relationships are consistently stronger for women.</span></p><p>We believe these findings have important implications for parents, heads of K-12 schools, and legislators currently considering bills to raise minimum ages or require age verification for some kinds of sites (especially social media and pornography). We’ll address those implications at the end of this post. But first: what did Sapien Labs do, and what did they find?</p><p><span>Sapien Labs is a non-profit research foundation with the goal of understanding how the rapidly changing social and technological environment is changing human brains and minds. Their main research project has been the </span><a href="https://sapienlabs.org/global-mind-project/" rel="">Global Mind Project</a><span>, an ongoing program that tracks mental well-being around the world using a comprehensive assessment of mental health along with questions about demographics and various cultural, technological, and lifestyle factors. They have issued a </span><a href="https://sapienlabs.org/research-and-reports/" rel="">variety of reports on the state of mental health around the world</a><span>. Among their most important findings is that in all the regions they’ve studied, mental health is worst for the youngest generations.</span></p><p><span>It didn’t used to be this way. There is a well-known finding in happiness research that, </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-020-00797-z" rel="">across nearly all nations</a><span>, happiness or well-being forms a U-shaped curve across the lifespan (See </span><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781466891234/thehappinesscurve" rel="">Rauch, 2018</a><span>). Young adults and people in their 60s and 70s are happier than those in middle age. But that may be changing, </span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.837638/full" rel="">especially for women</a><span>, as Gen Z (born in and after 1996) enters young adulthood. You can see the sudden collapse of young adult mental health in some of our </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/the-teen-mental-illness-epidemic" rel="">previous</a><span> </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/international-mental-illness-part-one" rel="">posts</a><span> on this Substack. For example, Figure 1 shows that up until 2011, young Canadian women were the </span><em>most</em><span> likely to report having excellent or very good mental health. By 2015 they were the</span><em> least</em><span> likely, and the decline in their self-reported mental health accelerated after that, while it changed very little for older women. (The same pattern holds for </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/international-mental-illness-part-one" rel="">Canadian men</a><span>, but to a lesser degree.)</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6432f83-2793-4a51-b24b-5cb5ff86a30f_1350x930.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6432f83-2793-4a51-b24b-5cb5ff86a30f_1350x930.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6432f83-2793-4a51-b24b-5cb5ff86a30f_1350x930.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6432f83-2793-4a51-b24b-5cb5ff86a30f_1350x930.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6432f83-2793-4a51-b24b-5cb5ff86a30f_1350x930.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6432f83-2793-4a51-b24b-5cb5ff86a30f_1350x930.png" width="1350" height="930" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f6432f83-2793-4a51-b24b-5cb5ff86a30f_1350x930.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:930,&quot;width&quot;:1350,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;trends in very good mental health in canada.

These 47 elements are aggregated into a single score called the Mental Health Quotient (MHQ), which gives extra weight to patterns that indicate severe problems.

The second important feature is their international coverage. So, let’s zoom in and explore the six domain scores that make up the MHQ, first for the global sample, and then for the region and culture we know best: the Anglosphere.</p><p><span>As you’ll see if you read </span><a href="https://sapienlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Sapien-Labs-Age-of-First-Smartphone-and-Mental-Wellbeing-Outcomes.pdf" rel="">the full report</a><span>, the next step after examining the overall MHQ scores is to examine scores on the six domains of mental functioning:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>Mood &amp; Outlook</strong><span>: Includes items about optimism, calmness, anxiety, mood swings, sadness, and anger.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Social Self</strong><span>: Includes items about self-worth, relationships with others, empathy, cooperation, aggression toward others&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Adaptability &amp; Resilience</strong><span>: includes items about adaptability to change, ability to learn, and emotional resilience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Drive &amp; Motivation</strong><span>: Includes items about motivation, curiosity, enthusiasm, and addictions.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Cognition</strong><span>: Includes items about memory, decision-making and risk-taking, focus, and concentration, unwanted thoughts, hallucinations</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Mind-Body Connection:</strong><span> Includes items about sleep quality, energy level, appetite, and physical health issues.&nbsp;</span></p></li></ul><p>Figure 3 shows that for young women, all six domain scores show the same basic pattern as the MHQ: a consistent rise. You can also see that a few of the domains seem to rise more slowly or level off somewhat after the age of 13 or 14: Drive and motivation, Mind-body connection, and Cognition. However, the other three dimensions continue to rise all the way to age 18. The domain that rises fastest, meaning that it is most highly correlated with age of first smartphone, is the “social self” domain.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png" width="1300" height="1168" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1168,&quot;width&quot;:1300,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Mental Health Quotient Dimension Scores by age of first smartphone, Women&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Mental Health Quotient Dimension Scores by age of first smartphone, Women" title="Mental Health Quotient Dimension Scores by age of first smartphone, Women" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em><strong>Figure 3:</strong><span> The 6 domains of well-being, for young women, as a function of when they got their first smartphone.

First, the slopes are substantially lower, meaning that the mental health and well-being of young men are not as strongly related to the age at which they got their first smartphone as it is for their sisters, although it is still related.

From SapienLabs.org.</span></em></p><p>One major issue in analyzing an international dataset is that there are just so many differences between countries, regions, and religions that there are many opportunities for confounding variables to lead us astray. For example, in the Sapien Labs dataset, in the less wealthy countries such as India, few young adults had received a smartphone before the age of 10, which means that the data points on the left sides of the graphs contain almost no Indians, whereas the data points on the right side (no phone until 17 or 18) contain many Indians and fewer from the USA. If Indians are mentally healthier than Americans (for other reasons), this could cause the lines to slope even if smartphones had no effect on mental health. It is important, therefore, to look at individual countries and regions. (The Sapien Labs report does this in its appendix, where you can see that the trends hold for each of the world regions).&nbsp;</p><p><span>The region that we (Jon and Zach) know best and have </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/international-mental-illness-part-one" rel="">written on</a><span> </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1diMvsMeRphUH7E6D1d_J7R6WbDdgnzFHDHPx9HXzR5o/edit#" rel="">extensively</a><span> is the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglosphere" rel="">Anglosphere</a><span> (the English-speaking countries of The United States, Canada, The United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and sometimes Ireland).

They added the question about age of first smartphone in January and they are publishing a report, with data from nearly 28,000 participants, in May. We believe that this ability to move quickly is a public service during a global pandemic of teen mental illness. While their rapid report is not a standard academic publication and has not been through peer review (which often takes a year or more), the open access to the data has allowed us to investigate and confirm the trends they are reporting. We hope and expect that other researchers will download the dataset and offer critiques of the data, the analyses, and the conclusions drawn. This sort of “</span><a href="https://scholarlyassessmentreports.org/articles/10.29024/sar.26" rel="">post-publication peer review</a><span>” is becoming increasingly common as the problems with the existing peer review system become more widely known.</span></p><p><span>One issue to keep in mind with the Sapien Labs dataset is that the participants in each country are not a random or representative sample of the people in that country. Such studies would be extremely expensive to run, and now that so few people agree to phone solicitations or even answer their phones, it is unclear how representative such surveys can be. Those who agree to be interviewed, or who are motivated by money to participate, are not representative of the broader population. For this Sapien Labs report, participants came to the site on their own, or from online advertisements paid for by Sapien Labs, for the purpose of getting a detailed report on their wellbeing. So, the means reported for any country should not be treated like direct measures of the true means. However, samples such as these are still very useful for examining differences </span><em>within</em><span> the sample, such as those between men and women, or between those who got a smartphone early and those who got one late. And the much larger size of the Sapien Labs dataset, compared to Gallup and other survey organizations, allows for many additional analyses.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>A second factor to keep in mind is that like all surveys, what we get is correlational data that is open to alternative interpretations. The graphs in the report are likely to suggest to most readers that getting a smartphone early </span><em>causes</em><span> later mental health problems. But with correlational data we must always consider the possibility that the causal arrow could run in reverse. In this case: having low well-being as a young adult could </span><em>cause</em><span> people to believe that they got a smartphone earlier than they did, but this seems unlikely. We must also always consider that there could be “third variables” that cause both of the first two variables to rise. In this case, one plausible confounding third variable is </span><a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/permissive_parenting_style#:~:text=Permissive%20parents%20are%20not%20demanding,than%20children%20of%20a%20parent." rel="">permissive parenting</a><span>. Perhaps permissive parents (in each country) simultaneously do two things: they give their kids smartphones at very young ages, and they also give them few boundaries and little structure, which then interferes with development and produces struggling young adults. While this hypothesis is plausible and should be investigated, it is not clear how it would explain the fact that, in all the regions studied, it is the </span><em>girls</em><span> who show a tighter connection between early phone acquisition and later mental health problems, just as it is the girls who show a </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(18)30060-9/fulltext" rel="">tighter connection between heavy social media use</a><span> and concurrent mental health problems. Nor would it explain why mental health dropped so rapidly in the early 2010s (especially for girls) if permissive parenting (or some other variable about family life) was the real culprit.</span></p><p><span>And finally, we note that no one study is definitive, and more research is needed. We have been able to find a </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X22001439" rel="">few</a><span> </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17482798.2020.1725902" rel="">other</a><span> </span><a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.13851" rel="">studies</a><span> that </span><a href="https://wheatley.byu.edu/00000182-8d78-dff6-afab-8ffd11ce0001/teaching-by-example-pdf" rel="">examined</a><span> the age at which children got their first smartphones (We have created a new appendix [8.14] in our collaborative review doc on </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w-HOfseF2wF9YIpXwUUtP65-olnkPyWcgF5BiAtBEy0/edit#" rel="">Social Media and Mental Health</a><span>). So far they are mostly smaller studies that have produced mixed results. If you know of any others, please add them to the doc or put a link to them in the comments below. We want to get this right.</span></p><p><span>We cannot be </span><em>certain</em><span> that the correlations shown in the data are evidence of causality, but we think it is appropriate for those who care for children to act on the </span><em>preponderance</em><span> of the evidence (which is the standard in a civil trial) rather than waiting for evidence </span><em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em><span>(which is the standard used in a criminal trial. See proposition 2 in </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/why-some-researchers-think-im-wrong" rel="">this post</a><span>.) There is </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gojn35zOhnhfgdgquf5Tj4VsZk7Gtugt-eYS-2fQnpE/edit#" rel="">increasing evidence</a><span> that smartphones have a variety of detrimental effects on child development including reductions of sleep, focus, and time with friends in person, along with increases in addictive behaviors, so it makes sense that the cumulative effect of getting one’s first phone in elementary school would be larger than for those who don’t get a phone until high school. This is an important point made in the Sapien Labs report: The relationships they find suggest that there is a </span><em>cumulative effect</em><span> of having had a smartphone (and its many apps) over many years of childhood; they do not represent the effects of having used a phone a lot in recent days or weeks (which is the focus of </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w-HOfseF2wF9YIpXwUUtP65-olnkPyWcgF5BiAtBEy0/edit" rel="">most of the published research</a><span>).</span></p><p><span>We think the implications for action are strongest for policies related to children and younger teens––those still in elementary and middle school (that is, age 14 and below) In most of the graphs in this post, including those for the Anglosphere, the slopes of the lines are steepest for those ages, and the links are visible for boys as well as girls (though smaller for boys). This concern to protect children before and during early puberty is consistent with a </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29296-3" rel="">study published last year</a><span> which found that in a large longitudinal study of British adolescents, the peak years for evidence of links between social media use and lower satisfaction with life were 11-13 for girls (which corresponds to the early part of puberty), while for boys (who begin puberty a bit later) it was 14-15.</span></p><p>On the other hand, the implications for action related to older teens and especially boys are less clear, at least within the United States and other Anglosphere nations. The lines for boys are somewhat flat in those ages, and the increases for girls generally slow down too. Furthermore, the arguments for why high school students need a smartphone (rather than an alternative, such as a flip-phone) are stronger than the arguments for why elementary and middle school students need one.&nbsp;</p><p>We, therefore, believe that the Sapien Labs findings should motivate us to think carefully about whether and when to give children their own smart devices, especially before high school. It is not the Internet per se that is harmful; so much of the internet is fantastically educational, useful, and entertaining. The most relevant questions, we think, are: 1) At what age do you want to give a child continuous access to the internet and social media, even when away from home, even when sitting in class? 2) At what age do you want to give social media companies, and other companies, continuous access to a child’s attention? And 3) does a child really need a smartphone when other kinds of phones (such as “flip phones” or Light Phones) work just as well for general communication (phone calls and texting)?</p><p><span>The group </span><a href="https://www.waituntil8th.org/" rel="">Wait Until 8th</a><span> was founded to solve the collective action problem that parents and teens are in: Even if most parents wanted to wait until high school to give their children smartphones and social media, as long as most kids have those things by 6th grade, there will be enormous pressure on their children, and hence on the parents, to relent. Unless the parents can coordinate. So Wait Until 8th asks parents to sign a pledge, when their children are in elementary school, that they will wait until 8th grade to give them a smartphone. The pledge only takes effect once ten families in that child’s grade have signed the pledge so that the child will have a community of peers and will not feel so isolated before 8th grade.</span></p><p>We think this is a great idea, we just suggest that the pledge should be: Wait Until 9th. Or Wait Until High School. Children are usually 12 or 13 at the start of 8th grade; that is still within the period of early puberty. Plus, if 8th graders have smartphones, that means that smartphones will be everywhere in middle schools, increasing the desire of 7th graders to get them. To solve collective action problems, we think it’s best to focus on setting good norms within collectives (such as schools): make elementary schools and middle schools be smartphone free.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Parents understandably want to be able to reach their children when they are away from home, and a flip phone or other “dumbphone” is a very reasonable first phone that allows parents and children to reach each other. We suggest that parents not give smartphones as first phones. Let children learn to master a simpler kind of phone, one that cannot be loaded with addictive apps. Wait Until 8th offers an </span><a href="https://www.waituntil8th.org/devices" rel="">excellent list</a><span> of the many smartphone alternatives.</span></p><p><span>Many of the teachers and heads of schools that Jon talks to are bitter about the effects of smartphones on their students and their school culture. They complain about the constant drama unfolding on social media during the school day. They complain about the distraction and the increased difficulty of getting students’ attention during class, since many students sneak looks at their frequently-buzzing phones, especially those sitting in the back rows. Many schools say that they ban phones, but what they often seem to mean is “the rule is that you can’t take out your phone during class.” That means that some students (the ones most suffering from phone addiction) will learn to do it stealthily, and many of the rest will just pull out their phones as soon as class is over, thereby </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103122000634" rel="">missing out on face-to-face interactions</a><span> with the students right next to them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We suggest that schools consider going phone free, meaning that students can use their phones to arrive and depart from school, but once they enter, their phones (smart or dumb) would be placed in a phone locker, or in a lockable pouch. We think the case for doing this in elementary schools and middle schools is strongest. In a few weeks, Jon will write a substack post laying out the empirical evidence that smartphones distract students and disrupt education, </span><a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/691462" rel="">even when they are kept in students’ pockets</a><span>.</span></p><p>We also suggest that school districts collaborate with social scientists to do experiments on entire schools, rather than on individual students. What if a state or district identified 20 middle schools that were willing to cooperate, and then randomly assigned half of them to go phone free?&nbsp; There is no research of this kind that we can find, yet such a simple study would give us results within a single year that could potentially yield findings that improve both mental health and educational outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p><span>If there is a cumulative effect of smartphone ownership in childhood, and if the effect is due in part to heavy use of certain kinds of apps (such as social media) rather than other kinds of apps (such as watching movies, or using Wikipedia), then it becomes even more vital that we develop ways of age-gating certain apps and content. At present, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act" rel="">US law sets a minimum age of 13</a><span> at which children can sign contracts with companies to give away their data (when they check a box on the terms of service). But </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-13-became-the-internets-age-of-adulthood-11560850201" rel="">the law was written such that</a><span> the companies are not required to verify ages. As long as a child </span><em>says</em><span> that she is 13 or older, she’s in and can create a social media account.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This must change. If the minimum age were enforced, it would help parents solve their collective action problem, at least with regard to Instagram, Tiktok, and other social media sites for underage users. It is precisely Congress’s failure to enforce the age 13 rule that puts parents in the trap. Many states are now introducing legislation to remedy this omission. And there is one federal bill that does a particularly good job of focusing on age limits and age verification: The </span><a href="https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-cotton-murphy-britt-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-help-protect-kids-from-harmful-impacts-of-social-media" rel="">Protecting Kids on Social Media Act</a><span>, introduced by Senators Schatz (D-HI), Cotton (R-AR), Murphy (D-CT), and Britt (R-AL). The act would “set a minimum age of 13 to use social media apps and would require parental consent for 13 through 17 year-olds.&nbsp; The bill would also prevent social media companies from feeding content using algorithms to users under the age of 18.” The bill also requires social media companies to develop rigorous age verification methods. (There are already many in existence, and many more would appear if the bill gets passed.) We also think the </span><a href="https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2023/5/blackburn-blumenthal-introduce-bipartisan-kids-online-safety-act" rel="">Kids Online Safety Act of 2022</a><span>, introduced by senators Blumenthal (D-CT) and Blackburn (R-TN) would do a lot to make social media less damaging to children, and easier for parents to control. The fact that so many bills are bipartisan, at both the state and federal level, is a very encouraging sign in our polarized time. Legislators often report seeing the problems in their own children.</span></p><p><strong>In conclusion:</strong><span> there is a great deal that can be done, individually and collectively, to address one of the top fears that parents express, about the safety and health of their children. The Sapien Labs data offers us new insight into the nature of the problem, and it alerts us that the problem may be global. It also guides us to the ages at which reform efforts are most likely to work.</span></p><p>POSTSCRIPTS (added on May 18, 2023)</p><p>1—We welcome additional and deeper analyses of the Sapien Labs data, and will post links here to such reports whether they support or contradict our analyses in this post.</p><p><span>2—One issue we should have discussed in the text is the inclusion of </span><em>tablets</em><span>, along with smartphones, in the Sapien Labs’ questionnaire. If their findings differ from those of other labs which asked only about age of first </span><em>smartphone</em><span>, then we won’t know whether part of the difference is the inclusion of tablets. We hope that future studies will ask about the two devices separately to figure out which devices are associated with harm at which ages (if any). </span></p><p>3—Some commentary online has made the important point that it’s not the phone itself which is harmful; it is the particular apps that the child uses, a child with a particular personality, in the context of a particular family that does (or does not) exercise oversight and apply restrictions. We agree. The original iPhone introduced by Steve Jobs was three devices: a phone, an iPod, and a web browser. Great! Three tools. Probably not harmful. It’s the addition of the app store that turned the smartphone into a portal to everything. If early acquisition of a smartphone is shown to be reliably associated with developmental problems, it would likely be because it enables continuous 18-hour-per-day access to hundreds of activities. </p></div></div>]]></description>

			<p>From a trash-filled Earth to the futuristic <i>Axiom</i> and back again, <i>WALL·E</i> is a finely crafted balance between consumerist dystopia and sixties space-race optimism. Please join me, then, for a detailed dive&nbsp;into the uniquely robotic future of a remarkably human film, as seen through the eyes of its eponymous hero, WALL·E.</p>

<p><em>[This article is from the&nbsp;</em><a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/book/">Typeset in the Future book</a><i>, which is really very good&nbsp;and you’re&nbsp;probably going to want to&nbsp;</i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1419727141/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=titf0f-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1419727141&amp;linkId=b321076a05a18b3ffdfd5fd8924ad645">buy a copy of</a><i>. If you’d rather read the article first, don’t worry—I’ll remind you again later on.]</i></p>
<p>Before we get started, there is an important detail we must clear up. Our hero’s name is not, as you might think, WALL-E. Moreover, it <i>definitely</i> isn’t WALL•E. His name is <em>WALL·E</em>, and that dot is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct">interpunct</a>, not a hyphen or a bullet.</p>
<figure data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_1492" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1492"><a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_02_37_2_full.jpg"><img src="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_02_37_2.jpg?w=1000" alt="walle_0_02_37_2" srcset="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_02_37_2.jpg 560w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_02_37_2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=62 150w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_02_37_2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=125 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1492">WALL·E’s front plate, clearly showing his interpunct.</figcaption></figure>
<p>An interpunct is, of course, a vertically centered dot originally used to separate words in Latin and ancient Greek. (Spaces weren’t invented until several centuries later.) The interpunct is still in use today—it’s the official decimal point in British currency (£9·99), and is used to represent the dot product of two vectors in mathematics (x · y). Most relevantly, it’s used in Japanese to separate titles, names, and positions, as in “課長補佐 · 鈴木” (Assistant Section Head · Suzuki). It is therefore entirely appropriate as the separator in WALL·E, which is short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter · Earth Class.</p>
<p>The bold extended typeface seen on WALL·E’s front plate is Gunship, designed by Dan Zadorozny, one of the unsung heroes of modern sci-fi type design. Dan is an amateur type designer from Texas whose <a href="http://iconian.com/">Iconian Fonts website</a> features more than six hundred free hand-crafted typefaces, many of which have been used by sci-fi movies, TV shows, and book designers.</p>
<p>In addition to WALL·E’s front plate, Gunship is seen on Earth and aboard the <i>Axiom</i>, the flagship spacecraft of megacorporation Buy n Large (BnL, for short), most notably for robot-facing wall and door typography. Its upper- and lowercase variants include different combinations of cutouts and curve orientations, giving designers flexibility when crafting robot signage. (Strictly speaking, this means that our hero’s name, correctly capitalized, is “waLL·e,” with the interpunct as a further customization—Gunship’s own interpunct is rectangular.)</p>

<p>The movie begins with an insight into WALL·E’s typical workday, which is spent building gigantic piles of trash by compacting waste into neat, stackable cubes. After a hard day’s crushing, we follow him on his journey home, learning some useful exposition along the way. This includes a bank of electronic ads for BnL, promoting everything from liquid air to quadruple-patty burgers. Common throughout these ads is an insistence on immediate consumption—“DRINK NOW,” “HUNGRY NOW,” “RUN NOW,” “CONSUME.” And if consuming a product once isn’t enough, you can repeat the experience a second time—the signage seen below includes ads for both “100% Reused Food” and “Regurgi-Shake: Twice the Flavor.”</p>
<p><a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_04_02_full.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_04_02.jpg?w=1000" alt="walle_0_04_02" srcset="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_04_02.jpg 560w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_04_02.jpg?w=150&amp;h=62 150w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_04_02.jpg?w=300&amp;h=125 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px"></a></p>
<p>We’ve seen how corporate mergers, such as <a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/2014/12/01/alien/"><i>Alien</i>’s Weylan Yutani</a> and <a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/2016/06/19/bladerunner/"><i>Blade Runner</i>’s Shimata-Dominguez</a>, are an inevitability in sci-fi futures. <i>WALL·E</i>’s Buy n Large is similar, except that this company was formed by a merger between a frozen yogurt manufacturer (Buy Yogurt) and a maker of suits for the larger gentleman (Large Industries). Clearly a marriage made in heaven, this corporate combination led to a rapid expansion, culminating with Buy n Large owning every company and government in the world.</p>
<p>The Buy n Large logo is an over-italicized customization of Futura Extra Bold Oblique, as demonstrated by a super-distinctive capital G in the BUY N LARGE BANK logotype that WALL·E passes early in the movie.</p>

<p>If the red-and-blue logo feels familiar, it shouldn’t be a surprise—it’s because BnL uses the exact same typeface and color scheme as real-world retail giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costco">Costco Wholesale Corporation</a>.</p>
<figure data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_1499" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1499"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Costco_Wholesale_logo_2010-10-26.svg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_costco_wholesale_logo.png?w=1000" alt="walle_costco_wholesale_logo" srcset="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_costco_wholesale_logo.png 560w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_costco_wholesale_logo.png?w=150&amp;h=45 150w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_costco_wholesale_logo.png?w=300&amp;h=90 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1499">The Costco Wholesale Corporation logo, in Futura Extra Bold Oblique.</figcaption></figure>
<p>There’s another curious BnL subsidiary to be found among the city’s electronic ads, on a beaten-up billboard advertising “Eggman Movers (Creating More Space).” This company is an Easter-egg reference to WALL·E production designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Eggleston">Ralph “Eggman” Eggleston</a>, and it shares the name of the moving company from 1995’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Story">Toy Story</a></em>, for which Ralph was art director.</p>

<p>The presence of a Buy n Large–branded bank means Buy n Large–branded banknotes, which are unusual for being strewn across the floor of the deserted city. If you look closely at the notes, you’ll see that some of them have “10<sup>6</sup>” in the corner, and are marked “ten million dollars.” Others look to be marked “99<sup>6</sup>,” suggesting that Buy n Large stores continued the classic $9.99 pricing trick even after adding six zeroes to the end of everything. (Indeed, it says much about the Buy n Large approach to consumerism that it prints notes with the 99s already included, to avoid customers having to receive any change.)</p>

<p>We discover later in the movie that the <em>Axiom</em> left Earth in the year 2105. This suggests that in the preceding years of overconsumption there was a period of severe hyperinflation, making a $10 million note a necessity. This is not without historical precedent—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe">Earth’s most extreme example of hyperinflation</a> occurred in Zimbabwe in November 2008, just a few months after <em>WALL·E</em>’s release, when the inflation rate for the Zimbabwe dollar reached a staggering 79,600,000,000 percent per month. At this point, a single US dollar was equivalent to 2,621,984,228 Zimbabwe dollars.&nbsp;The largest-denomination note printed during this time was the $100 trillion note, which makes Buy n Large’s $10 million bill seem like small change by comparison.</p>

<p>WALL·E leaves the bank behind and continues his journey via the disused tracks of the BnL Transit monorail system. In the absence of working trains, these concrete tracks provide a convenient route through the middle of the deserted city.</p>

<p>Despite their association with aspirational futures, monorails have been failing to become a global mass-transit system for almost two hundred years. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_monorail">The first passenger monorail</a> opened in 1825 in Cheshunt, England, primarily to transport bricks, though it was also utilized for transporting people, mostly for novelty purposes. Unlike the top-of-rail system seen in <em>WALL·E</em>, Cheshunt’s monorail consisted of carriages suspended beneath an overhead track, and was powered by a single horse.</p>
<p>The Cheshunt style of monorail—with suspended carriages hanging beneath a single rail—was also adopted by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuppertal_Suspension_Railway">Wuppertal Schwebebahn</a>, which began operation along the Wupper River in Wuppertal, Germany, in 1901. The Wuppertal’s suspended system is still in operation today, carrying more than sixty-five thousand passengers on an average weekday.</p>

<p>The monorail seen in <em>WALL·E</em> is of the style popularized by Swedish entrepreneur <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Wenner-Gren">Axel Wenner-Gren</a>, whose prototype ALWEG (<strong>A</strong>xel <strong>L</strong>ennart <strong>We</strong>nner-<strong>G</strong>ren) monorail system came to the attention of Walt Disney after a family visit to Wuppertal gave him monorail fever. Disney saw the potential for a monorail attraction at his new Disneyland theme park in California, and the Disneyland-ALWEG Monorail System opened in June 1959. The system remains in operation today (under the name Disneyland Monorail), and there are similar attractions at Disneyland Tokyo and Walt Disney World in Florida. In total, Disney monorails have transported more than one billion passengers into an aspirational transportational future.</p>

<p>It’s not entirely clear what US city WALL·E lives in, but the presence of a monorail network certainly positions it as a location that was once optimistic about the future. This mid-century futurism is borne out by other architectural features of the city, most notably a curved building seen among the billboards encountered earlier. This building is strongly reminiscent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Needle">Space Needle observation tower</a> in Seattle, Washington, which was built for the city’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_21_Exposition">1962 World’s Fair</a>, together with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Center_Monorail">ALWEG monorail system</a> that is still in operation today.</p>

<p>Near the monorail, WALL·E passes a promotional poster for himself, with the caption “Working to dig you out!” This poster has definite communist propaganda undertones, showing a stylized army of WALL·Es working together to build a brighter future. The implication of this design choice—that communist values are the solution to decades of rampant consumerism—is a pretty bold political statement for what is only the fourth minute of the movie.</p>

<p>Indeed, this gaze is&nbsp;<em>such</em> a common trope that it became the primary styling of the promotional poster for 2014’s banned comedy movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Interview"><em>The Interview</em></a>, in which two Americans travel to North Korea to interview the country’s leader, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un">Kim Jong-un</a>. (The <em>WALL·E</em> poster’s bottom-edge caption, punctuated by an exclamation mark, is a recurring design feature in North Korean propaganda posters.)</p>

<p>This aspirational style is an example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_realism">socialist realist design</a>, the officially sanctioned visual aesthetic of the Soviet Union, which positioned broad-shouldered, purposeful workers as the true heroes of the age. As a robot who is literally a rectangle, there is surely no worker more broad-shouldered and purposeful than our movie’s eponymous hero, WALL·E.</p>
<p>WALL·E’s self-promotional poster is also a fine example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handel_Gothic">Handel Gothic</a>, one of the movie’s supporting typefaces. Originally designed in 1965 by Donald J. Handel, the font has become a mainstay of design futurism. (Indeed, it is quite possibly the originator of one of our <a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/2016/02/18/futuristic/">rules for futuristic type</a>: Make straight things curved.)</p>

<p>My favorite use of the typeface in <em>WALL·E</em> occurs later in the movie, when we see the distinctly curved E of some Handel Gothic… on a handle. (I refuse to believe this is anything but a deliberate typographic joke.)</p>

<p>Handel Gothic enjoyed a particular resurgence when the type family was expanded in the 1980s, and will be immediately familiar to anyone who visited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epcot">EPCOT Center</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World">Walt Disney World</a> in Florida, which opened in 1982. (Later in this article, we’ll look in detail at the theme park, which is now named simply Epcot.) The original EPCOT Center logo was Handel Gothic all the way, making particularly good use of a lowercase n in “Center” to bring some extra curviness, and choosing a font variant with a curved leg in its R for consistency. (It also added <a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/2016/02/18/futuristic/">letter joining and slicing</a> for good futuristic measure.)</p>

<p>The movie that made Handel Gothic synonymous with sci-fi, however, was almost certainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind"><em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em></a>, released in 1977. <em>Close Encounters</em> used the typeface for its theatrical poster and for its opening credits, with the very words “Close Encounters” offering not one but three opportunities to recognize Handel Gothic’s trademark E.</p>

<p>But back to WALL·E’s journey. Toward the end of his trek home, he passes many more WALL·E units, all of them rusted and dead. The sole remaining WALL·E happily cannibalizes a Caterpillar track from a nearby broken unit to replace his own damaged part, and motors onward with the new track in place.</p>
<p>It’s an easy detail to miss, but WALL·E’s home is a broken-down “BnL WALL·E Transport” vehicle, which may once have housed all the dead units he just passed. When he reverses himself into a WALL·E-size bin in a rotatable storage rack a few minutes later and rocks himself to sleep, his loneliness as the last robot on Earth is made all the more acute by the uninhabited bins around him, now filled with ordered trash.</p>

<p>Before he climbs into bed, WALL·E retrieves his favorite VHS cassette from a nearby toaster, and pops it into a VCR. It turns out this is a beaten-up copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello,_Dolly!_(film)"><em>Hello, Dolly!</em></a>—1969’s awkwardly punctuated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Herman">Jerry Herman</a> musical.

<p>WALL·E watches his <em>Hello, Dolly!</em> cassette via a small, portable device that looks almost exactly like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Classic#5th_generation">Apple iPod Video</a>. I say “almost,” because the real-world iPod Video had a smaller click wheel than the one seen in <em>WALL·E</em>, had white labels on its buttons, and did not support external playback from a VHS cassette player. Nonetheless, this iPod is just one example of many in WALL·E’s home that evoke nostalgia for gadgets past, reinforcing that WALL·E himself is the discarded, unwanted technology that humanity left behind.</p>

<p>WALL·E awakes from robotic sleep on day two of the movie, low on power and dynamism. The fact that his head is a big pair of binoculars gives a great opportunity for a visual gag, as we see him literally bleary-eyed before activating the zoom lock on first his left eye, then his right, to reveal an eye-test chart in the opposing rack.</p>

<p>WALL·E’s binocular form is mimicked in the shape of his heads-up display (or HUD), which has the classic “two circles” shape used in many movies to indicate that we are looking from a character’s viewpoint through a pair of binoculars. This HUD raises an interesting question, however. Why does WALL·E have a heads-up display, with information overlaid on a video stream? A heads-up display really makes sense only if you are a human who has eyes; for a robot, any video input is combined with additional metadata from environmental sensors (such as direction, zoom, and power), and fed directly into the robot’s processor. Overlaying environmental information on a video stream implies that the robot has cameras that look at the world, and then <em>more</em> cameras that look at the augmented output of those cameras, which doesn’t make sense at all.</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is that WALL·E has a HUD because movie robots have HUDs, and movie robots have HUDs because they enable the viewer to visualize what the robots are thinking, even if it makes zero sense in technical reality. This trope began in 1973’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(film)"><em>Westworld</em></a>, whose final act shows us the world from the vantage point of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yul_Brynner">Yul Brynner</a>’s gun-slinging robot. Although Brynner’s HUD is not augmented with data, it is nonetheless <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-michael-crichtons-westworld-pioneered-modern-special-effects">the first use of computer-generated imagery in a feature film</a>. Director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton">Michael Crichton</a> cuts several times from a real-world scene to the robot’s pixelated version of the same, including a thermal image when Brynner chases his prey in the movie’s final act.</p>

<p>Day two (and act two) of <em>WALL·E</em> see a Buy n Large scout ship arrive on Earth, disrupting WALL·E’s routine. Most importantly, it introduces us to EVE, who is everything WALL·E is not. EVE’s shiny white design is technologically advanced; she’s the curvy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G4">iMac G4</a> to WALL·E’s boxy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_128K">Mac 128K</a>. Her design evokes sleek Apple products of the 2000s, with her head, in particular, highly reminiscent of a 2002 iMac G4’s base. Even her reboot sound is a futuristic take on Apple’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/24/jim-reekes-the-apple-sound-designer-who-created-sosumi.html">famous startup chime</a>, whereas WALL·E’s post-charge chime is the version Apple introduced in 1998 and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202768">removed altogether in 2016</a>.</p>

<p>EVE’s evocation of Apple product design is not entirely coincidental. In a <a href="http://fortune.com/2008/05/12/fortune-apples-ive-helped-design-the-heroine-of-pixars-wall-e/">2008 interview with <em>Fortune</em> magazine</a>, director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Stanton">Andrew Stanton</a> stated: “I wanted EVE to be high-end technology—no expense spared—and I wanted it to be seamless and for the technology to be sort of hidden and subcutaneous. The more I started describing it, the more I realized I was pretty much describing the Apple playbook for design.” This led to a 2005 call to Steve Jobs—at that time, both owner of Pixar and CEO of Apple—which in turn led to Apple design head <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jony_Ive">Jony Ive</a> spending a day at the Pixar headquarters in Emeryville, consulting on the EVE prototype. (It is surely entirely coincidental that EVE’s wireless arms and hands are reminiscent of Apple’s wireless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Mouse">Magic Mouse</a>, released the year after <em>WALL·E</em>.)</p>

<p>During a dust storm, WALL·E takes EVE back to the safety of his home, where he presents her with a small multicolored cube. In the three seconds the camera pans away for WALL·E to retrieve <em>Hello, Dolly!</em>, EVE solves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube">Rubik’s Cube</a> and returns it to her astonished host.</p>
<figure data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_1556" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1556"><a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_25_15_full.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_25_15.jpg?w=1000" alt="walle_0_25_15" srcset="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_25_15.jpg 560w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_25_15.jpg?w=150&amp;h=62 150w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_25_15.jpg?w=300&amp;h=125 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1556">WALL·E presents EVE with a Rubik’s Cube from his trash collection.</figcaption></figure>
<p>EVE’s cube-solving time would be impressive for a human; the current world record is 4.22 seconds, <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2018/5/feliks-zemdegs-achieves-fastest-time-to-solve-a-rubiks-cube-in-4-22-seconds-524695">set by Feliks Zemdegs in May 2018</a>. Sadly, because of the camera pan, we’ll never know if EVE broke the world record for a robot, which currently stands at a mind-boggling 0.637 seconds. This record was set in November 2016 by <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2017/3/video-robot-breaks-world-record-solving-rubiks-cube-in-0-637-seconds-464392">Sub1 Reloaded</a>, a cube-solving robot built by German engineer Albert Beer. Six high-performance stepper motors turned the cube twenty-one times to complete the task, averaging just 0.03 seconds per rotation.</p>
<figure data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_1557" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1557"><a href="https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/about-infineon/press/press-releases/2016/INFXX201611-014.html"><img loading="lazy" src="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_infineon_rubik_01.jpg?w=1000" alt="walle_infineon_rubik_01" srcset="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_infineon_rubik_01.jpg 560w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_infineon_rubik_01.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_infineon_rubik_01.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1557">Sub1 Reloaded, the world-record-holding Rubik’s Cube robot, in November 2016.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Spare a thought, then, for poor WALL·E. His surprise at EVE’s accomplishment is understandable—he lacks color vision and has only three digits on each hand, which means that Rubik’s Cubes are really not his specialty. (There’s a reason Guinness doesn’t have a “fastest dog” <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/search?term=rubik">Rubik’s Cube category</a>.)</p>
<p>One other point of note: This scene is the only time the color green appears in <em>WALL·E</em> in a scene unrelated to a plant. While this breaks the movie’s careful color scripting, it’s worth it for a good gag.</p>
<p>All seems to be going well with WALL·E and EVE’s introductions, until they are rudely interrupted by EVE’s spotting a plant that WALL·E has excavated from the trash. She subsumes the plant, as per her “directive,” and enters hibernation mode. WALL·E’s attempts to wake her invariably end in comedic pain, though one of them does reveal EVE’s serial number, 051682, set in Handel Gothic. (I can’t help but wonder whether someone in Pixar’s art department was born on May 16, 1982.)</p>
<figure data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_1558" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1558"><a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_30_08_full.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_30_08.jpg?w=1000" alt="walle_0_30_08" srcset="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_30_08.jpg 560w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_30_08.jpg?w=150&amp;h=62 150w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_30_08.jpg?w=300&amp;h=125 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1558">EVE’s serial number, seen on the inside of the door above, is 051682.</figcaption></figure>
<p>WALL·E gives up on reviving EVE and disconsolately returns to his trash-crushing routine. Shortly afterward, the <em>Axiom</em>’s scout ship returns to Earth and collects EVE to take her home. Desperate not to lose his new friend, WALL·E hitches a ride on the outside of the scout, causing him grief when the ship blasts through Earth’s surrounding satellite trash. As the satellites fall away, we see that WALL·E has a Soviet-era <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1">Sputnik 1</a></em> satellite on his head. This is impressive, especially given that <em>Sputnik 1</em>—the first man-made object to orbit Earth—burned up on reentry to Earth’s atmosphere in 1958.</p>

<p>Showing recent space technology as trash or as museum pieces positions our personal experiences of space as archaic and quaint in comparison to the <em>Axiom</em>’s futuristic styling. This further reinforces WALL·E’s own obsolescence as a discarded piece of technology, and sets us up neatly for a transition to the shiny futurism of the <em>Axiom</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Axiom</em> paints a vision of the future where every menial task, no matter how small, has a dedicated robot created expressly for the purpose. Like <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>’s HAL and <em>Alien</em>’s MU/TH/UR, all these robots have cute acronyms to make them human-friendly.</p>

<p>EVE’s acronym, sadly, is even worse. Her denomination as Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator could not be more inaccurate, given that her entire reason for existing is to evaluate vegetation on the planet <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Terra">Terra</a> (as Earth is known in Latin). Presumably, her moniker was chosen for cuteness rather than linguistic accuracy—after all, this movie is about WALL·E and EVE, not WALL·E and TVE.</p>
<p>Also of note is TYP-E, a typingbot who is designed solely to press keys when someone approaches the elevator shaft to the captain’s quarters. TYP-E provides an excuse for one of the movie’s best visual gags—as a robot, he has a keyboard made entirely, of course, from ones and zeroes.</p>

<p>The <em>Axiom</em>’s robots travel around the ship via their own dedicated corridors, separate from the craft’s passenger areas. These passenger areas are split into three classes—economy, coach, and elite—each of which has a distinct architectural style. The classes themselves do not play a functional role in the movie’s plot, but one has to wonder what they mean for the <em>Axiom</em>’s society. Are children born into the classes their ancestors originally purchased, as if into some kind of futuristic caste system? Would the <em>Axiom</em> have its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film)"><em>Titanic</em></a> moment if a passenger from economy bumped hover chairs with someone from elite? One thing’s certain: The styling of each class is extremely useful for helping viewers orient themselves within the ship’s overall structure as the action moves back and forth along its length.</p>
<p>Our introduction to the passenger area starts with the economy deck, which is compact, angular, and concrete in texture and color. Its palette is deliberately sparse, rarely moving outside the Buy n Large blue, red, and white, and making extensive use of the corporation’s Futura Extra Bold Oblique.</p>

<p>The deck’s design is highly reminiscent of the interior of the Contemporary Tower at Walt Disney World <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%27s_Contemporary_Resort">Contemporary Resort</a>, whose A-frame concrete-and-steel structure was so futuristic when it opened in 1971 that it even had a monorail running through the middle. (As anyone who has stayed at the Contemporary can attest, however, its rates can hardly be considered “economy.”)</p>

<p>The coach deck, unlike the economy deck, is curved, eclectic, and spacious, with brightly colored holo-ads scattered everywhere. It mimics Las Vegas’s Strip in gaudiness and style, with artificial neon colors used extensively and every sign encouraging <em>Axiom</em> passengers to spend more money. (How the ship’s financial economy continues to function after a seven-hundred-year flight continues to remain a mystery.)</p>

<p>The ceiling of the coach deck is a gigantic animated screen that can switch between day and night, complete with a BnL-branded sun or moon. The ceiling’s relationship to <em>actual</em> time is somewhat tenuous, as we see when Captain McCrea winds the sky back from 12:30 p.m. to 9:30 a.m. in order to make his morning announcements. In this regard, the ceiling is essentially an amalgam of two Las Vegas landmarks: the painted cloud ceilings of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Forum_Shops_at_Caesars">Forum indoor arcade</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesars_Palace">Caesars Palace</a>, whose lighting <a href="http://www.colorkinetics.com/showcase/installs/Caesars-Palace-Forum-Shops/">ebbs and changes</a> without ever making it nighttime enough for you to want to stop buying things, and the four-block-long overhead screen of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_Street_Experience">Fremont Street Experience</a>—the world’s largest video screen—whose 12.5 million LEDs illuminate Vegas partygoers every night. The result is an entirely fake sky for the <em>Axiom</em>’s population, allowing finely tuned control over their artificial environment.</p>

<p>The coach deck leads to the elite deck, whose styling resembles that of a high-class lido or spa. Despite their very different palettes, the coach and elite decks share a curved, futuristic environmental styling that unifies their overall architecture. <a href="http://www.animationartconservation.com/design-with-a-purpose%2C-an-interview-with-ralph-eggleston.html">According to production designer Ralph Eggleston</a>, the architecture of this shared area is inspired by the work of architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Calatrava">Santiago Calatrava</a>, whose signature curved supports and arches can be seen throughout both decks’ central concourse.</p>

<p>The other main influence for the <em>Axiom</em>’s architecture is the design of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrowland">Tomorrowland</a> area of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland">Disneyland</a>, in California. According to production designer Ralph Eggleston, during the movie’s production <em>WALL·E</em>’s design team visited an exhibition of Tomorrowland concept art and took inspiration from the designs therein.&nbsp;Perhaps the most obvious of these influences is the presence of a PeopleMover transportation system running through the middle of the club and elite decks, in a style very similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PeopleMover">PeopleMover</a> at Tomorrowland. (Do check out DaveLandWeb’s fantastic <a href="https://www.davelandweb.com/peoplemover/">PeopleMover photo page</a> for some great examples of the original in action.)</p>

<p>The evolution of Disney’s PeopleMover concept began with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_New_York_World%27s_Fair">1964–65 New York World’s Fair</a>, for which the Ford Motor Company asked Disney to <a href="https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/67807/#slide=gs-292282">design an attraction</a> to compete with General Motors’ <a href="http://www.nywf64.com/gm06.shtml">Futurama II</a> exhibit. The resulting <a href="https://www.waltdisney.org/blog/beyond-magic-skyway">Magic Skyway</a> gave fairgoers an opportunity to ride in a <a href="https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/361330/">driverless Ford convertible</a>—including the just-launched Ford Mustang—through a diorama that transported them from prehistoric times to a futuristic space city.</p>
<p>Following its success at the World’s Fair, the traction system behind Magic Skyway was adapted into a new feature for Tomorrowland’s 1967 relaunch. The new attraction, known as the WEDway PeopleMover, enabled <strong>W</strong>alter <strong>E</strong>lias <strong>D</strong>isney to follow Axel Lennart Wenner-Gren (of ALWEG monorail fame) in naming a futuristic transportation mechanism with his initials. It also provided an ideal inspiration for the <em>Axiom</em>’s central transport system.</p>
<p>The <em>Axiom</em>’s PeopleMover has much in common with its WEDway counterpart. Both are focused on a main circular loading area in the heart of a central plaza, with a long, straight stretch of track extending away from the loading deck. Both give passengers a tantalizing view of surrounding attractions as they are transported from one area to another. Indeed, I am sure Walt Disney would have been delighted to see his dream of future transportation integrated into the <em>Axiom</em>’s space-age environment, especially given that Disneyland’s PeopleMover was a prototype for Walt’s grander vision of futuristic living. Walt planned to build a larger PeopleMover installation as part of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPCOT_(concept)">Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow</a>, or EPCOT—a new and futuristic city to be created from scratch at his planned Disney World Resort in Florida.</p>
<p>In October 1966, Walt recorded <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/theoriginalepcot/film-transcript">a short film</a> pitching his “Florida Project” to industrialists and legislators, including a detailed description of EPCOT’s transportation system. In this new city, cars and trucks were to be pushed underground, with the community’s twenty thousand residents instead traveling by WEDway and monorail to work, play, and socialize. The concept images below from Walt’s EPCOT film give an idea of just how much imagination the creative brains at WED Enterprises applied, under Walt’s careful guidance, to everyday living challenges.</p>

<p>Tragically, Walt Disney died less than two months after his EPCOT introduction was filmed, passing away before the pitch was screened and before New Tomorrowland opened to the public. His ambitious vision of a prototype community did not become a reality, but its name lives on in the Epcot theme park (formerly “EPCOT Center”) at Walt Disney World in Florida—although the eventual EPCOT park became more of a permanent World’s Fair than a real-life city of the future. The WEDway PeopleMover did not realize its potential, either: The Disneyland attraction closed in 1995, to be replaced by the faster (but short-lived) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Rods">Rocket Rods</a> ride, which itself closed in 2001.</p>
<p>Disneyland park-goers can still see the PeopleMover’s abandoned tracks snaking through Tomorrowland, displaying curved, arched supports that Santiago Calatrava would surely approve of. (Thankfully, a PeopleMover can still be experienced at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Kingdom">Magic Kingdom park</a> at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrowland_Transit_Authority_PeopleMover">Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover</a> continues to provide a leisurely tour of nearby attractions.)</p>

<p>Of course, the PeopleMover also lives on via the <em>Axiom</em>, whose reimagining of the concept is almost a microcosm of Walt’s vision for EPCOT. Aboard the <em>Axiom</em>, it’s a PeopleMover (not a monorail) that fulfills the role of high-speed arterial transport, with individual BnL hover chairs completing the “final mile” of the journey via preset illuminated paths (blue for humans, white for robots, red for stewardbots). It may not match the scale of Disney’s EPCOT dream, but it’s nonetheless fitting that Walt’s vision of a transportational future made the trip into space.</p>

<p>During WALL·E’s tour of the passenger decks, we discover that the <em>Axiom</em>’s computer is voiced by none other than <em>Alien</em>’s Ellen Ripley.

(Weaver also plays a disembodied voice in Andrew Stanton’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finding_Dory"><em>Finding Dory</em></a>, aping her narration of nature documentaries.)</p>

<p><em>Alien</em> and <em>Aliens</em> are not the only sci-fi movies to get a nod from <em>WALL·E</em>. On the <em>Axiom</em> bridge, we meet AUTO, the ship’s autopilot robot. It might be hard to believe just by looking at him, but AUTO is actually an Evil Space-Based Computer. His design is clearly influenced by a certain other ESBC—that central red eye is a direct reference to <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>’s HAL, giving an immediate signal that this robot is not to be trusted.</p>

<p>AUTO’s physical similarity to HAL gives him a practical similarity, too. On the rare occasions we see the world from AUTO’s vantage point, we get an extreme fish-eye view of the surrounding area, just as we did for HAL in <em>2001</em>. WALL·E combines HAL’s fish-eye view with <em>The Terminator</em>’s red HUD hue, making AUTO’s evil intent doubly clear to any discerning fan of sci-fi.</p>

<p>AUTO and HAL belong to a long-standing tradition of sci-fi automata whose glowing red eye(s) give away their evil nature. They really are everywhere in sci-fi movies—from the Model 101 in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator">The Terminator</a></em>, via the replicants in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner">Blade Runner</a></em>, to the evil wriggly thing inserted into Neo’s belly button in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix"><em>The Matrix</em></a>.</p>

<p>That red glow has its benefits, however.

<p>AUTO may look like the movie’s bad guy, but his actions are simply an example of artificial intelligence following its programming too literally. To understand his motives, we must remember that BnL’s original plan was for its star liners to return to Earth as soon as an EVE probe found proof that life was once more sustainable. Five years after their departure, however, BnL autopilots were sent a directive by CEO Shelby Forthright telling them to keep their craft in space indefinitely, because the cleanup process on Earth was not going to succeed. Six hundred and ninety-five years later, with no subsequent instructions to the contrary, AUTO is simply following this command to the letter, blocking any and all attempts to return to Earth.</p>
<p>In this regard, AUTO is eerily similar to <em>2001</em>’s HAL, whose murderous tendencies aboard the <em>Discovery</em> were similarly driven by an inability to reconcile a contradiction in his programming. In the movie’s sequel, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010:_The_Year_We_Make_Contact">2010: The Year We Make Contact</a></em>, we learn that the basic purpose of HAL’s design was “the accurate processing of information without distortion or concealment.” We also discover that HAL was instructed (via Directive NSD 342/23) to lie to Dave and Frank about the real reason for the <em>Discovery</em>’s mission. After lip-reading that they planned to disconnect him, HAL determined that the only logical way for him to both keep processing and avoid lying was for Dave and Frank to die.</p>
<p>AUTO’s own instruction is Directive A113, whose numbering may sound familiar to Pixar fans. “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A113">A113</a>” appears in every Pixar film, from a family license plate in <em>Toy Story</em> to an underwater camera model in <em>Finding Nemo</em>. (Indeed, it’s even in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_(2012_film)">Brave</a></em>, where the roman numerals ACXIII appear carved just above the front door of a witch’s hut.) The reason for its repeated inclusion is that room A1-13 was the classroom for the <a href="https://filmvideo.calarts.edu/programs/character-animation">Character Animation Program</a> at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_the_Arts">California Institute of the Arts</a>, where Pixar alumni <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lasseter">John Lasseter</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Docter">Pete Docter</a>, and Andrew Stanton studied. (This explains why it’s also the number on the door of Riley’s classroom in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Out_(2015_film)"><em>Inside Out</em></a>, and on the Scaring 101 classroom door in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsters_University"><em>Monsters University</em></a>.) <em>WALL·E</em> may be its highest-profile outing, but it’s there in every Pixar movie if you keep your eyes peeled.</p>

<p>The majority of <em>WALL·E</em>’s robots are voiced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Burtt">Ben Burtt</a>, the Academy Award-winning sound designer and creator of R2D2’s bleeps. AUTO’s voice, however, is provided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlainTalk">MacInTalk</a>, a speech synthesis technology <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B-XwPjn9YY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m10s">first used to announce the Apple Macintosh computer in January 1984</a>. (You may also recognize MacInTalk as the lead vocalist on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead">Radiohead</a>’s “Fitter Happier,” from 1997’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK_Computer"><em>OK Computer</em></a> album.)</p>
<p>MacInTalk’s inclusion in <em>WALL·E</em> makes it one of only two Apple voice synthesis technologies to star in a feature film; the other is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri">Siri</a>, who provides the voice for ’Puter, Batman’s high-tech assistant in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lego_Batman_Movie">The LEGO Batman Movie</a></em>.</p>

<p>Despite the technology’s age, I’m happy to report that MacInTalk voices still ship with macOS today. If you’d like to turn your Mac into an Evil Space-Based Computer, simply open the System Preferences application, select Accessibility and then Speech, and enable the “Ralph” system voice.</p>
<p>In addition to AUTO, there are two more nods to <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> in <em>WALL·E</em>, both of which take advantage of preexisting associations for dramatic or comedic effect. The first is WALL·E’s brief escapade in a LifePod, the design of which seems clearly inspired by <em>2001</em>’s EVA pods. That iconic ball-like shape immediately triggers an association with interstellar peril, which WALL·E soon discovers is entirely justified.</p>

<p>Once again, <em>WALL·E</em> is sneakily using prior sci-fi art as a shortcut, re-creating familiar effects so that the <em>Axiom</em>’s quick journey home can be explained without exposition.

<p>As these homages show, <em>WALL·E</em> is not afraid to borrow from its predecessors to gain some free sci-fi association. Indeed, such references are celebrated and elevated, drawing on the production team’s clear fondness for vintage sci-fi to create a movie that is both a love letter to the classics and a worthy addition to the list. <em>WALL·E</em> capitalizes on our existing associations with the future to communicate complex plot points and motives with minimal dialogue and text. It is, to my mind, Pixar’s most realistic vision of an internally consistent world, despite the polar opposites of its Earth- and space-based environments. It’s political and satirical, representing utopia and dystopia with enough humor to poke fun at the downsides of both. In short, <em>WALL·E</em> envisages a future that could so easily be bleak and pessimistic—but is instead inspired by the naïveté of its inhuman heroes to re-create the optimism that took man into space in the first place.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>A global internet sweep that examined the websites and mobile apps of 642 traders has found that <strong>75,7% of them employed at least one dark pattern, and 66,8% of them employed two or more dark patterns</strong>.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>Dark patterns are defined as practices commonly found in online user interfaces and that steer, deceive, coerce, or manipulate consumers into making choices that often are not in their best interests. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>This year’s annual International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN) Sweep took place between January 29 and February 2, 2024. It involved participants, or “sweepers,” from 27 consumer protection enforcement authorities in 26 countries around the world.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>For the first time, the ICPEN sweep was coordinated with the Global Privacy Enforcement Network (GPEN). GPEN is a network of over 80 privacy enforcement authorities, which aims to foster cross-border cooperation across privacy regulators and strengthen personal privacy protections in an increasingly global market. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>The collaboration recognizes the growing intersection between consumer protection and other regulatory spheres. In the case of deceptive design patterns, it was clear to both privacy and consumer protection sweepers that many websites and apps employ techniques that interfere with individuals’ ability to make choices that best protect their consumer or privacy rights.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>Sweepers evaluated the sites and apps based on six indicators identified by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as being characteristic of dark commercial patterns&nbsp;<a href="#_ftn1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span><span>[1]</span></span></span></span></span></a>. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>The ICPEN report found that potential <strong>sneaking</strong> practices, such as the inability of the consumer to turn off auto-renewal of subscription service, and <strong>interface interference</strong>, for example making a subscription that is advantageous to the trader more prominent, were encountered especially frequent during the sweep. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>Both ICPEN and GPEN, who are working together to improve consumer and privacy protection for individuals around the world, published reports outlining their findings today. The ICPEN report can be found <a href="https://icpen.org/sites/default/files/2024-07/Public%20Report%20ICPEN%20Dark%20Patterns%20Sweep.pdf">here</a> and GPEN report can be found on their <a href="https://www.privacyenforcement.net/content/2024-gpen-sweep-deceptive-design-patterns">website</a>. </span></span></span></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>One-time passwords are often sent via SMS. Security researchers from the CCC recently had live access to over 200 million such SMS messages from more than 200 affected companies.</p><div><blockquote><strong>WhatsApp code: 2342</strong><br>You can also tap on this link to verify your phone:<br>v.whatsapp.com/2342<br>Do not share this code.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Transfer to DE63 4306 0967 1239 7690 03</strong><br>Amount: 1,312.00 EUR<br>TAN: 161161<br>Please enter this TAN to complete the transaction.<br>This TAN is valid for 5 minutes.</blockquote>
<h3>Why SMS?</h3>
<p>Two-factor authentication via SMS (2FA-SMS) is a method to increase the security of authentications. Alongside the static password, a dynamic code sent via SMS is required. The user must enter this code during login to prove they know the password (1st factor: knowledge) and have access to the phone number (2nd factor: possession). Thus, a stolen password alone is not enough to take over the user's account.</p>
<h3>Well-Known Attack Vectors</h3>
<p>This method has been under attack for some time. Through techniques like SIM swapping or exploiting SS7 vulnerabilities in mobile networks, attackers can intercept SMS messages. Alternatively, users can be tricked through phishing attacks into revealing their one-time passwords. <a href="https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2013/de-mail-unqualifizierte-makulatur">The CCC advised against using SMS as a second factor as early as 2013</a>. Nonetheless, 2FA-SMS is widespread. It offers more security than simple password authentication.</p>
<h3>Now Also Viewable Online!</h3>
<p>The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) now demonstrates a previously neglected attack on 2FA-SMS: Service providers are commonly used to send these messages. These providers send large volumes of SMS for various companies and services and have access to the SMS content. Thus, the security of the authentication process also depends on the security of these providers.</p>
<p>IdentifyMobile, a provider of 2FA-SMS, shared the sent one-time passwords in real-time on the internet. The CCC happened to be in the right place at the right time and accessed the data. It was sufficient to guess the subdomain "idmdatastore". Besides SMS content, recipients' phone numbers, sender names, and sometimes other account information were visible.</p>
<h3>Nearly 200 Million SMS from Over 200 Companies</h3>
<p>Over 200 companies that entrusted this provider directly or indirectly through other service providers with the security of their authentication were affected. This included companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, as well as Telegram, Airbnb, FedEx, and DHL. Over 198 million SMS leaked in total.</p>
<p>By simply viewing the live feed, it would have been possible to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take over WhatsApp numbers</li>
<li>Conduct financial transactions or log in to various services without access to the phone, provided the password was known</li>
</ul>
<h3>(Not Yet) a Catastrophe</h3>
<p>To truly misuse the SMS codes, attackers would typically still need the password. However, "1-click login" links were also included in the data. For some large affected companies, only individual services were protected by IdentifyMobile. Nevertheless, IdentifyMobile's negligence exposed companies and their customers to significant risk. This is evident from the numerous similar inquiries from data protection departments worldwide now reaching us through all channels.</p>
<p>We are happy to confirm that we did not keep the data. However, we cannot rule out that others may have accessed it.</p>
<h3>2FA-SMS is Better Than Nothing, But Other Methods Don’t rely on IdentifyMobile</h3>
<p>One-time passwords generated in an app or using hardware tokens are more secure and independent of the mobile network. If this option is available, we recommend using it. And any second factor remains better than just one, the password.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Records in the sub ledger will have much more granular data then the general ledger, like who the specific customer is, specific line items in an order, etc. The difference in data between the sub-ledger and GL will depend on the type of business and volume of data you are working with. Some small businesses can get away with not having any sub-ledgers at all, but it is doubtful that they would ever need custom software to manage something that is so low in scale.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Financial Record: </strong><span>This refers to the general ledger and sub-ledgers. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Material: </strong><span>A financial event is considered </span><em>material</em><span> if it is significant enough to impact the decisions of stakeholders based on financial statements. Note that this definition is somewhat ambiguous by design, as different businesses have different materiality thresholds.

This statement is a little broad and up to some interpretation so I will give some real examples.</p><p>If we sell a 10 units of a product that costs $9.99, the corresponding financial records must add up to $99.90. This seems obvious but when you are aggregating thousands (in a lot of cases millions) of transactions, simple summation or rounding errors between systems can cause material inaccuracies. </p><blockquote><p><strong>Wasteman’s Note: </strong><em>People say naming is the hardest problem in computer science, I would say a close second is addition. After working on large scale financial systems for the past few years, I can’t remember how many times the smallest bugs caused large discrepancies in our data. Also don’t get me started on summations over floats. I learned the hard way why you should always use integers.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>The financial record also needs to be </span><strong>complete</strong><span>. More specifically, both the sub-ledger and the general ledger are a complete representation of all business activities that occurred. If there is an event that occurred but is not in the financial record, than the system is not complete. </span></p><blockquote><p><strong>Wasteman’s Note: </strong><em>Another surprisingly really hard problem is guaranteeing completeness. As your system scales, data hops between many systems and at each hop data can easily be mutated or dropped by accident.</em><span> </span></p></blockquote><p>Very related to accuracy, your financial record must be easily auditable so that stakeholders can detect errors and accurately measure performance of your business. And even if you don’t care, the IRS definitely does. </p><p>This one depends entirely on your business and it's specific needs. Small businesses can get away with just dumping all numbers near the end of the month, just in time to close the books. Larger businesses generally want to avoid this, and have a near real time system. This allows them to monitor financials within the month, make decisions based on financial data faster, and reduce the rush to close the month/quarter in the first few days of the month.</p><p><span>But whatever that need is, our accounting system should meet the needs of your business, and whatever </span><strong>timely</strong><span> means to them.</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>Wasteman’s note: </strong><em><span>People tend to get lost in conversations about batch vs streaming systems with respect to timeliness a lot. My take is that this isn’t an important distinction to make. </span><a href="https://www.ververica.com/blog/batch-is-a-special-case-of-streaming" rel="">Batch is just a special case of streaming</a><span>. If you’re data is modeled correctly, its pretty easy to switch between them especially with unified frameworks like </span><a href="https://beam.apache.org/" rel="">Apache Beam</a><span>.</span></em></p></blockquote><p>The three main engineering principles your accounting system should abide by are</p><ol><li><p>Immutability and Durability of data</p></li><li><p>Data should be represented at the smallest grain</p></li><li><p>Code should be Idempotent</p></li></ol><p>This allows for auditability, which helps debugging and in turn accuracy. When data is immutable, you have a record of what the state of the system was at any given time. This makes it really easy to recompute the world from previous states, because no state is every lost.</p><p>Building on, once data is stated in the financial record it cannot be deleted. Any corrections to the system must be represented as a new financial transaction. For example let’s say your system had a bug and accidentally reported that a service was sold for $1000, when it should have been $900. To correct this mistake, you should first reverse the accounting entries corresponding to the mistake, and restate the accounting entry for the correct amount. </p><p>It will look something like this: </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png" width="1456" height="1237" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1237,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:87028,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>So you can see that in the financial record, there is evidence that the balance of Accounts Receivable (AR) and Revenue was $1000 at some point, but was corrected later. Even though that balance was incorrect, we want an audit trail of what the balance was at any given moment.</p><p>Similar to the above principle, this is also critical for enabling a clear audit trail. Even though financial reports and the general ledger are aggregated, they are computed from more granular events. When the data doesn't make sense, you need the most granular data to debug what might have been the issue. </p><p>Saving data at the lowest granularity also makes it really easy to correct data that is derived from that dataset. If a single immutable dataset is the core source of truth for all views of that data, to correct the view all you need to do is rerun the pipeline that creates that view after fixing your data. </p><p>Similarly when accountants are preparing to close the books, they reconcile account balances with all the transactions that occurred to validate that the books are accurate. When a discrepancy is discovered, you can dig into the exact transaction that might be causing the issue.</p><p>Every financial event can only be processed once, duplicates in the financial record will cause obvious inaccuracies. For that reason, all code that produces financial records should be idempotent.</p><p>Over the years, I have run into quite a few gotchas that have caused me a lot of pain. Below are best practices I recommend, to avoid the many pitfalls I have personally faced.</p><p><strong>Use integers to represent financial amounts</strong><span>. Makes arithmetic much easier. Avoid floats at all costs.</span></p><p><strong>Granularity of your financial amounts should support currency conversions with minimal loss of precision</strong><span>. If you are only working with dollars, representing values in cents might be sufficient. If you are a global business, prefer micros or a </span><code>DECIMAL(19, 4)</code><span>.  The decimal choice is quite popular among financial systems, but micros has been the standard for ads financial systems. This limits loss of precision when converting between currencies</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>Wasteman’s note: </strong><em>Micros of a currency = smallest unit * 1,000,000. E.g $1.23 = 1,230,000 micros. I first came across this when working with Google’s metrics API.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Use consistent rounding methodologies</strong><span>. At scale the way you round can create material differences between expected amounts. For example one rounding methodology is to round all values 5 and up to the next significant digit, and 4 and below rounds down. Another valid way is to always round up. All that matters is you are consistent across the board. When you are dealing with millions of transactions, being off by 1 cent per transaction can lead to material differences. (10 million transactions off by 1 cent, leads to a difference of $100k). This may not be material to your business at this scale, but it’s material enough for the government to come after you for underpaying taxes.</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>Wasteman’s note: </strong><em>If you are a global business there can be a lot of gotchas with rounding and currency conversions. I would go as far as saying you should make a centralized library/service to handle both rounding and currency conversions. Different governments respect different rounding rules when calculating taxes, so having all these nuances abstracted into a single service will reduce complexity.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Delay currency conversion as long as you can</strong><span>. Preemptively converting currencies can cause loss of precision. Delay currency conversions until after aggregations occur in their local currency.</span></p><p><strong>Use integer representations of time</strong><span>. This one is a little controversial but I stand by it. There are so many libraries in different technologies that parse timestamps into objects, and they all do them differently. Avoid this headache and just use integers. Unix timestamp, or even integer based UTC datetimes work perfectly fine. The less data conversions that occur between systems, the better. (Read about Etsy’s own problems with timestamp types </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/codeascraft/the-problem-with-timeseries-data-in-machine-learning-feature-systems" rel="">here</a><span>)</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>Wasteman’s note: </strong><em>I haven’t even talked about daylight savings related bugs. Using an incrementing integer can help you avoid this altogether. If you really insist on using datetimestamps, please at least use UTC. You would be surprised at how many very large businesses use non UTC timestamps.</em></p></blockquote><p>Thanks for reading this post, I am sure I made a controversial statement somewhere but please feel free to comment and start a discussion.

</code></pre><p dir="auto">The first column in the output tells you how much space a given entry takes up on your disk.
This can be an overcount, however, because of hard links (identical files that are only stored
once on the disk). Hard links under a directory are deduplicated in the first column's number,
but hard links that go outside of a directory to somewhere else will still be counted here.</p>
<p dir="auto">That's where the second column comes in. It tells you how much of an entry's size is shared
with other entries outside of it because of hard links. In the output above, we can see that
most of the entries have a lot of data shared with other entries, but the root directory only
has 225M shared with others. This tells us that there's a lot of hard links going between all
of the entries shown above.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to see how much of an entry's size is unique to just it, you can subtract the second
column from the first one.</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>dut</code> is a single source file, so all you need is a C11 compiler:</p>
<pre><code>gcc -O3 -flto main.c -o dut
</code></pre><p dir="auto">To install, copy the <code>dut</code> executable to a directory on your PATH, e.g. <code>/usr/local/bin</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>dut</code> is remarkably fast, but it doesn't win in all cases. It loses to a couple programs when
Linux's disk caches aren't populated yet, which is usually the first time you run it on a certain
directory. On subsequent runs, <code>dut</code> beats everything else by a significant margin.</p>

<p dir="auto">It's hard to say. My best guess is they have a really HDD-unfriendly access pattern, since they
both use Rayon for multithreading which uses FIFO ordering for tasks. This results in them doing
a breadth-first search of the filesystem, whereas <code>dut</code> and <code>du</code> both use depth-first search. I
don't know why one ordering is better than the other, but the difference is pretty drastic.</p>
<p dir="auto">I also think that ordering is the reason <code>dut</code> doesn't do so well on SSD either, but I'm not so
sure of that.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>In this paper, we study the highly competitive arena of baby naming. Through making several Extremely Reasonable Assumptions (namely, that parents are myopic, perfectly knowledgeable agents who pick a name based solely on its uniquness), we create a model which is not only tractable and clean, but also perfectly captures the real world. We then extend our investigation with numerical experiments, as well as analysis of large language model tools. We conclude by discussing avenues for future research.

<p>Northwestern Medicine and Brigham and Women’s Hospital scientists have discovered a molecular defect that promotes the pathologic immune response in systemic lupus erythematosus (known as lupus) and in a study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07627-2">published</a> in <em>Nature</em>, show that reversing this defect may potentially reverse the disease.</p>



<p>Lupus affects more than 1.5 million people in the U.S. Until this new study, the causes of this disease were unclear. Lupus can result in life-threatening damage to multiple organs including the kidneys, brain and heart. Existing treatments often fail to control the disease, the study authors said, and have unintended side effects of reducing the immune system’s ability to fight infections.</p>



<p>“Up until this point, all therapy for lupus is a blunt instrument. It’s broad immunosuppression,” said co-corresponding author <a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=33689">Jaehyuk Choi, MD, PhD</a>, the Jack W. Graffin Professor, an associate professor of <a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/sites/dermatology/index.html">Dermatology</a> and a Northwestern Medicine dermatologist. “By identifying a cause for this disease, we have found a potential cure that will not have the side effects of current therapies.”</p>



<p>“We’ve identified a fundamental imbalance in the immune responses that patients with lupus make, and we’ve defined specific mediators that can correct this imbalance to dampen the pathologic autoimmune response,” said co-corresponding author Deepak Rao, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a rheumatologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and co-director of its Center for Cellular Profiling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the study, the scientists reported a new pathway that drives disease in lupus. There are disease-associated changes in multiple molecules in the blood of patients with lupus. Ultimately, these changes lead to insufficient activation of a pathway controlled by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which regulates cells’ response to environmental pollutants, bacteria or metabolites. Insufficient activation of AHR results in too many disease-promoting immune cells, called the T peripheral helper cells, that promote the production of disease-causing autoantibodies.</p>



<p>To show this discovery can be leveraged for treatments, the investigators returned the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-activating molecules to blood samples from lupus patients. This seemed to reprogram these lupus-causing cells into a cell called a Th22 cell that may promote wound healing from the damage caused by this autoimmune disease.</p>



<p>“We found that if we either activate the AHR pathway with small molecule activators or limit the pathologically excessive interferon in the blood, we can reduce the number of these disease-causing cells,” said Choi, who is also a member of the <a href="https://www.cancer.northwestern.edu/">Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>. “If these effects are durable, this may be a potential cure.”</p>



<p>Choi, Rao and colleagues next want to expand their efforts into developing novel treatments for lupus patients. They are now working to find ways to deliver these molecules safely and effectively to people.</p>

The silence is broken by the sound of metal upon metal as a mailbox is opened and closed. Suddenly, a loud scream rends the air. It is followed by a deep, full-throated sobbing and the soft, raspy sound of paper being shredded.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Someone somewhere has just read a review of her novel in the <em>New York Times</em> <em>Book Review</em>, and it is devastating. Someone somewhere now lies splayed in a fuzzy yellow bathrobe and pink bunny slippers, her left cheek imprinted by the grimy pavement while her right hand pounds desperately at the box, as if the action might reverse time itself. Her roommate, following the sound of her cries, has found her and is trying to get her up. The writer’s left hand clutches the now tattered remains of the review; the name “Michiko Kakutani” appears in the byline. A few phrases and words can be seen here and there: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/13/books/13kakutani.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lot of pompous hot air</a>,” “<a href="https://slate.com/culture/2017/07/how-franzen-mailer-and-other-authors-responded-to-michiko-kakutani-s-reviews.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a definite dead end</a>.” Slowly, the two make their way back to their house, the writer still sobbing, her roommate gently holding her up.</p>

<p>Michiko Kakutani’s <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/07/michiko-kakutani-leaving-the-new-york-times" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2017 departure</a> as the chief book critic at the <em>New York Times</em> was greeted with bombastic reverence: <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/07/michiko-kakutani-leaving-the-new-york-times" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Vanity Fair</em></a> declared that she had been “the most powerful book critic in the English-speaking world.” The <em>New Yorker</em>’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/farewell-michiko-kakutani">Alexandra Schwartz</a> wrote that “her assessments of novels and memoirs, works of history, biography, politics, and poetry have guided generations of American readers.” The <a href="https://authorsguild.org/news/legendary-book-critic-michiko-kakutani-steps-new-york-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Authors Guild </a>declared that she had been the rare critic whose reviews could “make or break a book.” And the <em>Times</em>, no doubt keen to inflate its own importance, declared her “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/business/media/michiko-kakutani-times-book-critic-steps-down.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feared and revered</a>” and noted that her departure—“<a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/michiko-kakutani-steps-down-as-chief-book-critic-parul-sehgal-named-book-critic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the changing of the guard among critics</a>” at the paper—was a “<a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/michiko-kakutani-steps-down-as-chief-book-critic-parul-sehgal-named-book-critic/">seismic change</a>.”</p>

<p>Much of this, like the anecdote above, is an exaggeration. Still, Kakutani’s reputation helped solidify the <em>Times’</em>s<em> Book Review</em> and its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Sellers List</a> (which appears in the print version of the <em>Review</em>) as arbiters of taste and quality. This is an entirely undeserved reputation: while Kakutani’s reviews were occasionally, ah, bracing, she often seemed more focused on showing off her dexterity at snideness than reviewing books, sometimes adopting <a href="https://live-legacy-admin.nypl.org/blog/2017/07/31/many-voices-michiko-kakutani?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the voice of a literary character</a> from a different book than the one she was reviewing: Holly Golightly in a review of Truman Capote’s <em>Summer Crossing</em> or Holden Caulfield when reviewing Benjamin Kunkel’s <em>Indecision</em>. (The results were embarrassing.) In recent years, the <em>Book Review</em> has become so anodyne, its reviewers so reluctant to express opinions that even Kakutani’s reviews might now prove a welcome distraction. As for any influence: A 2004 <a href="https://users.ssc.wisc.edu/~sorensen/papers/bookreviews.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> of the impact of the <em>Review</em> on sales by Alan T. Sorensen and Scott J. Rasmussen found that while positive reviews increase sales, even negative reviews can positively impact sales. But the media landscape has since changed vastly. More recently, in 2023, the publicist <a href="https://kathleenschmidt.substack.com/p/book-publicity-what-works-and-what" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kathleen Schmidt </a>opined that “media consumption has changed so much that big publicity isn’t necessarily effective” and that while “many authors dream of being reviewed in <em>The New York Times</em>, […] a review there rarely sells many copies of a book.” In a 2022 essay in <em>The Nation, </em><a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/new-york-times-book-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kyle Paoletta</a> writes about the <em>Review</em> having “less influence than it once had.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>And yet, the <em>Book Review</em>, which has been around <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/insider/book-review-history.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since 1896</a> (the <em>Times</em> was founded in <a href="https://www.nytco.com/company/history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1851</a>),<span><sup>1</sup></span>&nbsp;remains influential, like the dying embers at the center of a slowly ebbing fire, and it continues to exercise its insidious influence upon the public, many readers, and book editors who are looking for examples of what the <em>Review</em> considers “good” or “great” books. Among the many ill effects: the <em>Book Review</em> tokenizes non-white writers in essentialist ways, reducing them to mere standard-bearers of their perceived cultures, and this attitude is too often replicated by even the most seemingly edgy review publications. Its emphasis on the Big Five publishers and book sales has meant that writers likely feel compelled to write towards what they imagine a <em>Book Review</em> critic might want to see. Despite all these issues, and its declining reputation notwithstanding, the <em>Book Review</em> has so long been imitated that its worst characteristics have seeped into that amorphous realm we might term “book culture”—a world where unspoken traditions about how to read and whom to read and why have taken hold and authors are compelled to write in ways that conform to gendered and racialized expectations or the apparently unrelenting public desire for more trauma memoirs.</p>

<p>By reinforcing in its content the worst trends in publishing, the <em>Book Review </em>ultimately perpetuates the material inequality so prevalent in the publishing world. Publishing is massively profitable—but <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/71505-how-much-top-publishing-executives-earn.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only for top executives at a few places</a>: their salaries can run in the millions. For positions lower on the hierarchy, the average salary (some hiked by unionization at places like HarperCollins) <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/92099-starting-salaries-at-big-publishers-grow.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generally starts around $48,000</a>, which is a dismal salary for someone living in a city like New York, where most publishing houses are based. In fact, the book industry is increasingly skewed to include only those who can work for free in unpaid internships or for meager salaries supplemented by family or spousal wealth. In turn, these up-and-coming editors and agents tend to seek writing from those in their own spheres of influence which means that, more and more, fiction and nonfiction work only echo worldviews of a very particular set of people (in mainstream publishing, this means a very liberal mindset rather than any kind of truly left perspective, with rare exceptions). While many have criticized the <em>Book Review</em> on grounds that it is boring and perhaps simply irrelevant, few have considered the long-lasting economic effects of its moribund style.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kakutani’s reputation was built on a 38-year career at the 173-year-old <em>Times</em>, which she <a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/michiko-kakutani-steps-down-as-chief-book-critic-parul-sehgal-named-book-critic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined as a reporter in 1979</a> before becoming a book critic in 1983. Since then, the book review world has changed drastically, with fewer publications devoting money to books. For a while it looked like online blogs and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/about/us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goodreads</a>, a reader-generated online review site, might be plausible alternatives to more conventional media coverage of books, defying the norms set by professional critics. But by the 2010s, <a href="https://frappesandfiction.com/2022/03/19/book-blogging-is-dead-the-future-of-blogs/#:~:text=Well%2C%20in%20my%20personal%20experience,But%20that's%20okay." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the blogs had mostly disappeared</a> as their writers either stopped from the exhaustion of working for free or very little or, ironically, were absorbed into the mainstream. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/01/amazon-goodreads-elizabeth-gilbert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goodreads</a>, founded in 2007, was bought by Amazon in 2013 and has since become notorious as a den of pure spite. In June 2023, the author <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/12/1181714943/elizabeth-gilbert-halts-new-book-release-russia-ukraine">Elizabe</a><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/12/1181714943/elizabeth-gilbert-halts-new-book-release-russia-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">t</a><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/12/1181714943/elizabeth-gilbert-halts-new-book-release-russia-ukraine">h Gilbert</a> announced she was “halting” the release of her forthcoming book <em>The Snow Forest</em> after hundreds of people on the site, many claiming to be Ukrainian, denounced her book for being set in Russia and “<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elizabeth-gilbert-cancels-book-russia-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">romanticizing the aggressor</a>.” No one had read even an advance reader’s copy: all of the outrage was based simply on the fact of the location of the story. Gilbert, much to the consternation of many in the book world, capitulated to the hordes.&nbsp;</p>

<figure><a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/subscribe" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://images.currentaffairs.org/2024/05/Subscribe-Ad-V1.gif" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="534"></a></figure>

<p>Despite the apparent power of social media websites to “cancel” famous writers like Gilbert, these outlets are still more fragile than institutions like the <em>New York Times</em>. Consider, for instance, everything happening now to TikTok, which could be gone by the time this goes to print. Social media trends tend to wax and wane while readers seek reliable reviews. The <em>Book Review</em>, in this fragile and ever-changing world, still exerts too much influence on book culture.</p>

<hr>

<p>Reading the <em>Book Review</em> is a joyless task because it is mostly so massively, stiflingly dull. There is a sameness and a flatness to the reviews, held as they are to some invisible set of <em>Times</em> “standards,” the most obvious one of which seems to be, “Never be interesting.” A recent review of Anthony Fauci’s memoir, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/18/books/review/on-call-anthony-fauci.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>On Call</em></a>, describes it as “a well-pressed gray flannel suit of a book with a white coat buttoned over it,” as if its dullness is the best thing about it. Other than a mild comment about the overuse of “bureaucratese” (phrases like “proof of the pudding” and “pushing the envelope,” which are simply clichés), the entire “review” by Alexandra Jacobs reads like a dutifully written 8th-grade summary.&nbsp; I have read reviews there by some of the wittiest writers whose prose sparkles elsewhere but who, when transplanted to the hallowed and hollow grounds of the <em>Times</em>, quietly shrivel and hush. To enter the world of the <em>Book Review</em> is to stumble into a boring tea party: everyone has nothing but niceties to murmur to each other, everyone is dropping quotes from Joan Didion and some dead white guys, and everyone’s tea is secretly laced with gin just to keep them going.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If there are opinions, especially negative ones, they are offered tremulously, coddled in several caveats, as in the review of Fauci’s book. This is by design. In 2018<em>, </em>Pamela Paul, the <em>Book Review</em> editor from 2013 to 2022, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/reader-center/book-review-conflicts-of-interest.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that it “has a long tradition of being a political Switzerland.” Paul eventually left her post to become an insipid <a href="https://www.hamiltonnolan.com/p/columnists-and-their-lives-of-quiet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bourgeois reactionary columnist for the <em>Times</em></a> opinion section, which indicates that even she grew tired of faking neutrality. But the principle still holds at the publication, where the reviews are so bland and sleep-inducing that one is tempted to hold every reviewer by their feet, upside down and outside a window, threatening to let go: <em>Give me an opinion, damn it! Now! Or I drop you! </em>A book review doesn’t have to be a vicious takedown in order to be interesting, but it should demonstrate some sense of a personality behind the work, of someone unafraid to deliver keen and original insights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Newspapers like the <em>Washington Post</em> and the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> do still have book sections, and there exist some publications devoted to reviews, like the <em>Boston Review </em>(<em>BR</em>)<em>, </em>the <em>New York Review of Books </em>(<em>NYRB</em>),<em> </em>and the <em>Los Angeles Review of Books </em>(<em>LARB</em>). There are transnational publications, like the <em>London Review of Books</em> (<em>LRB</em>) and the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em> (<em>TLS</em>). All of these vary in their purposes and personalities: the <em>LARB</em>, a magazine for refugees from academia, is the Goth-ish graduate student who drops words like “epistemic” in an effort to impress their theory professor. The <em>LRB</em>, the most idiosyncratic (and usually the most lively) of the bunch, is that very clever and slightly high uncle who tells you about the latest book he’s been reading when you stop to chat at the Christmas party. By the end of the very long conversation, you will have learned absolutely nothing about the book, but you will have received some fantastic insights into the career and life of Lord Byron (later, a Google search will reveal that the book is about a 20-century physicist). The <em>NYRB</em> is that very boring family friend who has no idea how to talk to anyone who’s not a tenured professor and consequently spends most of his time in an armchair. The only person who will talk to him is the <em>Book Review</em>, and the two promptly engage in a competition to see who can drop the most quotations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of the newer review publications came about in the shadow of the <em>Book Review.</em> Some were formed as direct rivals (the <em>New York Review of Books </em>slyly took on a similar name at its inception in 1963). Others, like the <em>LRB</em>, which began life as an insert inside the <em>NYRB </em>and is famous for its long essays, usually on academic books, have consciously set out to be different. The <em>Book Review</em>, amidst all this, has resolutely stuck to its guns and persisted in being the most boring of the lot, holding on to its dullness as a badge of pride.</p>

<p>Its age has meant that the <em>Book Review</em> has survived like and alongside the descendants of the robber barons who swooped into New York and stuck around long enough to place their names on public institutions, their money and philanthropy enabling them to buy respectability as a new aristocracy.</p>

<p>Much of the <em>Book Review’s</em> reputation is based on lies and confabulation. For example: the famed bestseller list is, alas, utter bullshit. This fact first came to light in 1983, when William Peter Blatty, the best-selling author of <em>The Exorcist</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Book_Review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued the <em>Book Review </em></a>for not including his novel <em>Legion</em> in its best-seller list. Blatty claimed that the book had been selling well enough to be placed there. Blatty lost the case because the <em>Times</em> <a href="https://www.kallistipublishing.com/the-truth-about-the-new-york-times-best-seller-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> that its decisions about who is included are editorial and not purely based on quantitative figures. In other words, “Yes, you’re right, we ignored your book because we run on a lie. The bestseller list is not about the numbers, it’s about what we like!” Essentially, the <em>Times</em> admitted its “sales” list was meaningless (even as their website densely notes that their “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/methodology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">methodology</a>” involves sales). <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a42189320/the-new-york-times-best-seller-lists-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to <em>Esquire</em> in 2022</a>, Temple University professor Laura McGrath, who teaches courses on the publishing world, “compares <em>The New York Times’</em>&nbsp; list to the original recipe for Coca-Cola: ‘We have a pretty good idea of what goes into it, but not the exact amount of each ingredient.’” In 2013, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2013/02/22/heres-how-you-buy-your-way-onto-the-new-york-times-bestsellers-list/?sh=4d9965c33a7b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Forbes</em></a> wrote about authors gaming their way onto the list with bulk orders.</p>

<p>Given all this, how and why does the <em>Book Review</em>, an armageddon-era cockroach scuttling around in the long shadows of nuclear towers, survive?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like its parent paper, the <em>Book Review</em> is less a cultural mirror (what is happening around you?) and more of a ladder for class ascension (who will or can you be?). The <em>New York Times</em> is not a paper of record as much as a guide to class assimilation and ascension: to read and absorb the <em>Times</em> is to learn (or so people hope) how to exist in a world that is in many ways brought into existence by the <em>Times</em>, one inhabited and controlled by the superrich. The paper’s real estate listings and reporting and its column “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-hunt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hunt</a>” have long demonstrated that its core readership is either the very wealthy or those who aspire to be so. One column is titled, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/23/realestate/hamptons-home-sale-hunt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">She Realized Her American Dream With a Hamptons House</a>” [that only cost $6.75 million]. Similarly, its “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/vows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vows</a>” section features couples from wealthy and often celebrity families. Often, real estates and vows combine, as when wealthy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/20/realestate/rome-italy-apartment-prices-hunt.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-the-hunt&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Interactive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newlyweds</a> go looking for apartments. Over the years, the immensely wealthy have certainly grown more diverse, but their money remains the point. A recent wedding announcement about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/style/captain-sandy-yawn-wedding-leah-shafer.html">Sa</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/style/captain-sandy-yawn-wedding-leah-shafer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">n</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/style/captain-sandy-yawn-wedding-leah-shafer.html">dy Dolores Yawn</a>, a reality television celebrity, and her entrepreneur-gospel star wife, noted that their ceremony took place on a superyacht (we assume this is a term meant to denote a very, very, <em>very</em> big yacht, bigger than all the <em>merely </em>big yachts that the merely rich might use).&nbsp;</p>

<p>New York is always a city of a new Gilded Age, each one representative of its era, and the <em>Times </em>is in charge of shepherding the denizens of each up the social ladder. As with clothing fashions, its fascination with the wealthy shifts according to the political tenor of the day. The paper might now adopt a sniggering tone towards Donald Trump, but in 1984, it was once deeply, madly in love with him: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/11/01/archives/donald-trump-real-estate-promoter-builds-image-as-he-buys-buildings.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 1976 profile</a> began with the words, “He is tall, lean and blond, with dazzling white teeth, and he looks ever so much like Robert Redford.” In 1984, catching up with “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/08/magazine/the-expanding-empire-of-donald-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Expanding Empire of Donald Trump</a>,” William E. Geist gushed about accompanying him on tours of his properties, without questioning the machinations behind his supposedly legendary dealmaking. The long article notes that Trump, who presented himself as a real estate magnate, had ditched his “flashy haberdashery” for more conservative “dark suits, white shirts, subdued ties and loafers.” Then, as now, the <em>Times</em> provided a seal of approval to an aspiring entrepreneur busily taking his family name out of Queens into Manhattan, where the newspaper’s imprimatur was one more step towards entrance into the elite(s) of New York.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Book Review</em> is a ticket for entry into this world because one must not just be rich and successful, but <em>cultured,</em> able to engage in the topics of the day—and the best way to do that is through books. You might <em>buy</em> all the famed artworks you can afford, but to talk about them as a person of the class you’d like to occupy requires that you read all the “best” books that the <em>Times</em> will tell you about. The <em>Book Review</em> is like a culture sommelier, helping you sniff and sip through all the books, books, books, guiding you through an otherwise frightening world of words, words, words: it will tell you what to read or, at least, how to talk about the book you ought to read but might never get around to reading. (Similar to its <em>NYT</em> cousin, “The Ethicist” column, which instructs readers on proper—and often hideous—<a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/2024/04/the-bourgeois-morality-of-the-ethicist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bourgeois morality</a>, the <em>Book Review</em> will instruct you on proper bourgeois literary opinion.)</p>

<p>To ensure its blandness, the <em>Book Review</em> engages in that ever popular and deeply cringe-inducing tradition that we might call the Dinner Party Syndrome: the tendency to valorize writers (at least the big names) as People You Might Love to Know and Invite to A Meal with Other Writers. Bits of this exist everywhere, but it’s especially pronounced in Elisabeth Egan’s breathy and mercifully brief interviews with authors, gathered in her regular <em>Book Review</em> column, “Inside the Best-Seller List.” Egan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/books/review/demon-copperhead-barbara-kingsolver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tells us</a> that Barbara Kingsolver has established a tradition of including recipes in her books: “In <em>Demon Copperhead</em>, a beloved character makes black-eyed peas for New Year’s Day. Readers can practically smell the carrots, onions and essence of Christmas ham.” And she cannot resist a bad pun: “Kingsolver also baked in an important message about addiction.” The Author here is a BFF and down-home neighbor: famous writers are Just Like Us! In an interview with the suspense writer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/books/review/shes-not-sorry-mary-kubica.html?searchResultPosition=13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mary Kubica</a>, we learn that she fosters as many as a dozen cats at a time. As Egan tells us, warmly, “If you think about it, the process [of the family adjusting to the adopted cats] isn’t so different from writing books.” We can see the long-lasting effects of such an approach even in the most cerebral-seeming publications. <a href="https://yalereview.org/article/merve-emre-critic-as-friend?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR1UlNmFL7TsklxldlV7eDbO-2XCcG9y6WM1Lr0dbrP23yMRxwv0guqfa_I_aem_AcrKw5EMml_sTCz2zqjo34zBHzv7pjeLnjt1SSBnK3crgF6ZsKq0DSkbr6jKw690vTnmxiADMd3BVvQl-_PeuhF7%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a recent <em>Yale Review</em> </a>essay, Merve Emre writes rhapsodically about “The Critic as Friend,” ending with her assurance to the reader: “I can suggest that you may come to feel as I feel about a person, a book, that you may want to know it as intimately as I do. I can help it pass gracefully from my hand to another’s, from the present into the future.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The BFF-fication of the critic-subject pair finds its expression in the unhealthy parasocial relationships that authors find themselves compelled to develop with readers on platforms like BookTok and Bookstagram. The result is that they can no longer retreat as, say, <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/movies/2015/08/post_75.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joan Didion was able to</a>, behind their literal walls, to maintain a distance from overly friendly and sometimes dangerously enthusiastic fans. They must instead give in to their demands for actual social relations and are caught in a world of perennial selfies, both virtual and in real life. And yet, as Elizabeth Gilbert found out, no amount of such intimacy can guarantee that your readers will come to your support: her Instagram has long been filled with breathy videos that often start with greetings like, “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5CYkRnM7q3/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hello, Family!</a>” or “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C5JHjRespi3/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s your Lizzy!</a>” and end with phrases like, “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C5JHjRespi3/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sending you a lot of love!</a>” Despite her relentlessly sunny chirpiness, all delivered in the style of an Aunty Karen, Gilbert still felt compelled to cancel herself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In keeping with its sommelier role, the <em>Times</em> only bothers with the <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/89038-over-the-past-25-years-the-big-publishers-got-bigger-and-fewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Five</a> publishers (soon, we suspect, to become The Only One, given the thrust towards consolidation). Forbidden from this world are books from independent publishers and writers without the cachet of known agents and publishers that <em>Times</em> employees are bound to bump into at literary parties. <a href="https://book-publicist.com/how-the-new-york-times-selects-books-for-review-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Self-published books (horrors!) are, of course, out of the question</a>. The <em>Times</em> has never challenged or even really interrogated the increasingly exploitative structure of the publishing world and, indeed, many of its main critics, such as Kakutani, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/dwight-garner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dwight Garner</a>, and Barry Gewen, have been able to use their status as critics at the paper to land publishing deals with places like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Wave-Radical-Disruption-Outsider-ebook/dp/B0C3ZK7W6R/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_w=S7OGp&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.f911c8db-3a2b-4b3e-952f-b80fdcee83f4&amp;pf_rd_p=f911c8db-3a2b-4b3e-952f-b80fdcee83f4&amp;pf_rd_r=139-2639195-3063806&amp;pd_rd_wg=px08Q&amp;pd_rd_r=fbd92857-b33d-484a-95ea-1cd0d0f0b5e5&amp;ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Penguin Random House</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Upstairs-Delicatessen-Eating-Reading-About-ebook/dp/B0BQGHJM5L/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.7nDQglnS2tlCD6IEdjvpxMyPootXHyx0jkmvWiArq9AjAbcwlsQcJkuT8lB2syWHpOFl3SwaVslXVf7PJCMwF2dnc10sR0G7ThQhvWH5QhDwehcul0wXiJ1izljEXaa_DUkinhoeyxqtRl5vZYUZcJtvHrYOF0KqSuFubm3T5287epbK-ZF0HJHMlN3S36NLTHBAu9Qq-jOAlECNxoVZHAwosFNKCXU1tbMpWGPZJe4.romk9gRk_Q5aHMdBDr0rGO9bPWcy8rEzFn7QndXs5Mg&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;qid=1719286773&amp;refinements=p_27%3ADwight+Garner&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Farrar, Straus and Giroux</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inevitability-Tragedy-Henry-Kissinger-World-ebook/dp/B07TK5RJ23/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1U2HHTNYBSYRL&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.GPN9UkRYYuzj01zdTwqGvr6AA722sS0H1xug4jSAepOcszmajScL81MQTk90j1k0.Cxt5U1qIFhAXP-GApriVTHRfue9rJHr3SkwNjJQIoec&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=barry+gewen&amp;qid=1719286810&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=barry+gewen%2Cstripbooks%2C98&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Norton</a>. While they and others might argue that their talent brought them such enviable deals, we should wonder aloud (as few are willing to do) if their (supposed) ability to make or break writing careers did not in some way help them to obtain their publishing contracts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This brings up the complex and occasionally thorny issue of ethics. The <em>Times</em>’s handbook of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/editorial-standards/ethical-journalism.html#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethical Journalism</a> can be found online, and the paper’s critics, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/a-o-scott" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/a-o-scott">.O Scott </a>and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/dwight-garner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dwight Garner</a>, have also posted individual statements online. But, as with its war reporting, ethics magically disappear. Dwight Garner, senior editor at the Book Review from 1998 to 2008 and currently a book critic, is married to Cree LeFavour, who has published<a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/authorpage/cree-lefavour.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a handful of cookbooks</a>, a novel, and a memoir, some of which are mentioned (more than once) or reviewed in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/search?query=Cree+LeFavour" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Times</em></a>. She has also frequently written book reviews. Sometimes there is mention of the fact that she is married to Garner. Food and wine writer Florence Fabricant favorably reviewed a new brand,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/dining/rocket-broth-for-sipping-or-souping.html?searchResultPosition=6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Rocket Broth</a>, noting only that the line is the creation of “Sheryl Moller, a certified health practitioner and nutrition guide, and <a href="http://www.creelefavour.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cree LeFavour</a>, a cookbook writer…” LeFavour’s father, Bruce LeFavour, was a well-known chef. His 2019 obituary in the paper notes that she confirmed his death, but it does not mention her marriage to Garner or that she is also a critic at the paper. Readers ought to know that books and broths recommended by the <em>Times</em> happen to be written and produced by someone who works at the paper (her reviews in the print edition occupy prime real estate) <em>and</em> whose husband occupies an influential position at the paper. But then, as we know from the poor quality of the <a href="https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/ny-times-found-no-7-october-rape-victims-reporter-admits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Times</em>’s coverage, such as their now-debunked Oct. 7 “mass rape” story</a>, “ethics” at the <em>Times</em> is a fungible commodity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And then there is the matter of race and ethnicity. Like every other publication of its ilk, including the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/15/1037323602/new-yorker-lack-of-diversity-magazine-bylines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>New Yorker</em></a>, the <a href="https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2012/why-88-of-books-reviewed-by-the-new-york-times-are-written-by-white-authors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Book Review</em></a> has been accused, justly, of being blazingly white. Kakutani is Japanese American (and perhaps the most powerful woman of color to ever have occupied such a position anywhere), and Gilbert Cruz replaced Pamela Paul in July 2022. There are more people of color reviewing books, and more books by people of color are being reviewed, certainly. And yet: the <em>Book Review</em> remains blindingly white in its outlook, moving between a discomfort with unfamiliar voices and styles to outright racism. The <em>Book Review </em>proves that whiteness—not as a racial identity but as a particular worldview—doesn’t need actual white people to extend its dominion. Karan Mahajan, reviewing Zadie Smith’s <em>The Fraud</em>, notes approvingly that she has a “multicultural eye,” and while we might imagine a giant ocular being surveying the London of the novel, it’s not clear what this brings to the book, which he mildly critiques as uneven in structure before quickly moving on with fulsome praise. But if a writer of the stature of Smith has produced an unevenly structured book, can it really be a fulfilling read or is the reviewer simply assuring white readers that Smith has, yet again, provided a lively cast of non-white people for their pleasure?&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for white critics incapable of engaging with the perceived Other: consider Dwight Garner’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/08/books/review/you-dreamed-of-empires-alvaro-enrigue.html#:~:text=What%20a%20treat%2C%20then%2C%20to,and%20the%20vibe%20is%20hallucinatory." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review</a> of the Mexican writer Álvaro Enrigue’s <em>You Dreamed of Empires</em>, in which he writes: “There are many names in this novel, and they can blur. To American ears, some of the most magnificent—Ahuitzotl, Xocoyotzin—sound like elite anti-depressants of the sort that only Sofia Coppola and Bad Bunny can source.” <a href="https://ohnotheydidnt.livejournal.com/127560643.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Some commenters on social media</a> pointed out that this is not only a deeply racist joke, but that the book includes a guide to pronouncing the names. Garner wrote this in 2024 (two years after Cruz took over), not 1954, as you might expect given its old-timey racism. Reading his words, I was reminded of a colleague’s boss who told his Indian employees that he couldn’t be bothered to learn their “difficult” names and would simply refer to all of them as “Ganesh.” Garner’s review of Enrigue’s book is a positive one, but he cannot resist several jabs, like his point that the writer, who has published several works translated into several languages worldwide, “has probably been best known as half of a literary power couple” and that “before their divorce, they were <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/alvaro-enrigue-valeria-luiselli-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">profiled in <em>Vogue</em></a>, adorably sharing a cigarette.” A white author featured in <em>Vogue </em>as part of a glamorous couple would have been written about with far more reverence, minus the sarcastic “adorably.” Here, Garner treats Enrigue as a curiosity. “Look,” he seems to say, “This adorable little foreigner can actually write! And haha, look at him preening in <em>Vogue</em> like one of us.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>But blatant racism is not the only problem: works by non-white authors are rendered as tokenistic, considered worthy not for their brilliance as novels or nonfiction but as the work of racial and ethnic Others who have something to <em>show</em> us—a part of, say, the immigrant experience. Bich Minh Nguyen’s 2007 memoir, <em>Stealing Buddha’s Dinner</em>, is about growing up as a Vietnamese refugee and the now-standard “torn between two cultures” experience that included a version of the Bento Box story: an immigrant child is mocked for their food and… you can fill in the rest because this trope became so ubiquitous that it is now <a href="https://www.eater.com/22239499/lunchbox-moment-pop-culture-tropes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dismissed as clichéd</a>. Nguyen, who has since changed her first name to Beth, wrote that first memoir when she was 33. Now, at 49, she has written a new one, <em>Owner of a Lonely Heart</em>, that continues the theme of her life story (really, there is only one) but with a new emphasis: her biological mother who stayed behind. But—worry not!—this memoir, reviewed by Sara Austin, also discusses food. Austin writes that Nguyen “was marked as a refugee by hostile stares and cruel jokes as a child, and as an adult in the way she can never quite unpack her bags in a new space.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Same book, new twists. Austin’s review says little about what Nguyen’s work contributes to the ever-growing genre of immigrant memoirs, has nothing to say about its politics, and only notes how it might make the reader <em>feel</em>: it is “poignant,” and “deeply ruminative and therapeutically self-indulgent.” Such is the kind of non-white fiction and nonfiction most favored by the<em> Book Review</em>. The immigrant’s story only exists to make us <em>feel</em> in a therapeutic way. This is not to blame Nguyen but a publishing and book review industry that seems unable to publish or review books by people who happen to be immigrants and are not just conduits for the same old stories. Nguyen had previously written two novels about similar life experiences but in fiction: like a squirrel hoarding its nuts for winter in its cheeks, she must feel compelled to carefully portion out bits and pieces of her life for literary consumption over the course of her writing career. Perhaps, in another decade, she will have the opportunity to capture a different slice of immigrant life, mining herself for yet another memoir (what might it be like to be the <em>mother </em>of second-generation immigrant children? we wonder, breathlessly). Might we ever reach a time when an immigrant writer writes about something other than stock immigrant experiences?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite any appearance of autonomy, Nguyen and others like her are not free to create non-traditional immigrant narratives because the responses of reviewers create a closed loop of influence: when reviewers only react positively to the same stale stories and cannot conceive that the darkies also have interesting lives unrelated to their immigration status, publishers and editors are more likely to demand the same stock texts about immigration or, really, anything else.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Book Review </em>may well wither and die under the weight of its own irrelevance, but it has had deleterious and long-term effects on writers and publishers—and it does not serve readers who look for work that disrupts their assumptions. Instead, the <em>Book Review</em> assumes they just want the same old boring oatmeal (<em>immigrant</em> readers, for instance, might be fed up with the same old trauma narratives). There are better and more interesting ways to think about books and book culture. One is to start thinking and actively writing about the economics of book publishing as part of the practice of reviewing books. Where the <em>Book Review</em> has for too long perpetuated stereotypes of books as fetish objects and authors as Sparkling Snowflakes we want to bring home to Mother, a better and more incisive book review culture would locate books firmly inside the material world, not outside of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this, podcasts—with more freedom and time and less pressure from traditional media—may be going in better, unexplored directions. Andrew Hankinson’s nonfiction podcast <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/sally-hayden-my-fourth-time-we-drowned/id1588244277?i=1000653348281" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Logroll</em></a> features writers who talk eloquently about their books within the context of the economics of publishing. In one episode, Hankinson talks to Sally Hayden, an independent researcher and author of <em>My Fourth Time We Drowned</em>, about refugees seeking to cross the Mediterranean Sea from Africa to Europe only to end up in detention centers in Libya. The conversation deftly connects the enormous difficulties facing these migrants with the trouble she had finding financial support for the project, all without being pedantic or engaging in white saviorism. <a href="https://www.backlisted.fm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Backlisted</em></a>, a fiction podcast fronted by John Mitchinson and Andy Miller, considers little-known authors or lesser-known books by famous authors. The two share a deeply infectious enthusiasm for their subjects and a keen knowledge of literary forms and histories, proving that a “love for books” does not have to mean a choice between weird parasociality and excruciating dryness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In more conventional outlets: the <em>Washington Post</em>’s Ron Charles <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/05/29/second-coming-garth-risk-hallberg-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writes</a> that Garth Halberg’s recent <em>The Second Coming</em> could have done with serious editing. Charles is not engaging in a snarky takedown but reflecting on an industry that churns out books, especially by star authors, <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/columns-and-blogs/soapbox/article/86324-the-end-of-editing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">without investing in committed editors</a>. Editing was once considered an essential part of publishing, but this basic attention to detail is “unheard of today under a business model banking on the continual release of bestsellers and copycat stories.” Or, at least, considered secondary: I recently reviewed a book with passages repeated across chapters, a clear sign that no one at the prestigious imprint had bothered to give it a basic once-over before it went to print. In the <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/10/13/arts/mountains-damned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Boston Globe</em></a>, Lorraine Berry was one of the few (if any) book critics who pointed out that Barbara Kingsolver’s <em>Demon Copperhead</em>, based in Appalachia<em>, </em>is “a form of poverty porn, a slum tour where pity is the price of the ride.” (Berry also wrote about “A Day in the Life of a Freelancer” for <em>Literary Hub</em>, a <a href="https://lithub.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-freelancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rare piece</a> where a writer discusses the near impossibility of creating a writing life of any stability or comfort unless one possesses independent wealth.)</p>

<p>It is, in short, possible to take a deep pleasure in books and the act of reading without submitting to a <em>Book Review</em>-led, ah, fiction that A Life in Books stands apart from the material conditions of the world. The way forward is not to replicate or improve the <em>Book Review</em> but to be done with it and its anodyne presentation, after cataloging its effects on book culture. More works by small indie presses need to be considered in more outlets, and “self-published” should not always be so stigmatized. We might also consider regularly reviewing books of the past, instead of only bowing to the fashions generated by major publishers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There will undoubtedly be resistance to much of this and, sadly, writers are often the most obstinate about perpetuating myths about books and publishing. <em>Esquire</em>’s <a href="https://www.esquire.com/author/10298/kate-dwyer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate Dwyer</a> regularly reports on the publishing world, <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a45751827/make-a-living-as-a-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but her work</a> is based on interviews with celebrity authors like Ayad Akhtar and Tom Perrotta, who are published by the Big Five, get excellent advances, and whose success and/or class status means they don’t have to take on day jobs to pay the bills. In a recent article on debut novels “<a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a60924704/debut-fiction-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failing</a>” to launch, she again focused on books at the Big Five, thus reproducing the idea—made popular by the <em>Book Review</em>—that those are what matter most and what should be counted. In such ways, we see the lingering effects of the cultish era (and aura) of reviewers like Kakutani and the mythology of the publishing world created by the <em>Book Review</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The dawn of the internet did not bring about a democratization of book reviews for the better—let us look again at Goodreads as an example of what can happen and then, quickly, look away. We still need critics to review publications that bring in intellectual and other histories while making judgments about books but without fetishizing books or authors. Good book reviews take their subjects and genres seriously: a romance novel deserves the same consideration as a satire of, oh, say, the publishing world. The style and purpose of the publication matter: a scholarly review will require a different set of facts and suppositions and a demonstration that the reviewer knows the history of a book’s subject; a website devoted to fans of an author or genre might allow for more emotional responses tempered by some kind of critical appraisal; and an outlet like the <em>Boston Globe</em> is more concerned with communicating ideas to a larger, broader range of readers.</p>

<p>Even with all these differences, there are still some basic principles of reviewing: reviews should in some way let readers know whether or not they should buy or borrow the book; readers should be able to trust that there are no conflicts of interest (consider, again, LeFavour and Garner). If a book is about 1950s suburban planning, it is pointless to spend three-quarters of the review ranting about gender imbalances in the workplaces of the time. We get it: you have a feminist politics, yay, but does the book provide an interesting history of its subject? Basic questions should be answered in some way: is the book’s thesis provable? If a novel, does it fulfill the basic requirements of plot and character? If it’s the kind of fiction that eschews such old-fashioned conventions, fine, but does it engage a reader in any way or is it simply like the sticker on a new Hermès bag: it doesn’t exist, and if you have to ask, you don’t know its value? Most of all, a review should deliver an opinion (this may seem like an obvious fact but, again, consider the<em> Book Review</em>).</p>

<hr>

<p>Kakutani retired by <a href="https://observer.com/2017/07/michiko-kakutani-leaves-new-york-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taking a buyout </a>from her employer as the paper struggled to restructure and cut costs. In the years since her departure, she has written lavishly produced books that offer nothing more than warmed-over liberal takes on “democracy,” a favorite subject of hers. They have not gone over well: reviewing her 2018 <em>The Death of Truth</em> in the <em>Times</em>, Chris Hayes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/books/review/michiko-kakutani-death-of-truth.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> with the despair of a man who wondered how to retrieve lost hours, observing that “it feels like spending a few hours scrolling through the #Resist hashtag on Twitter.” Her more recent <em>The Great Wave: The Era of Radical Disruption and the Rise of the Outsider</em> can be described entirely by its title and reads like a transcript of a TED talk: a simple and simplistic claim, repeated ad nauseam with great sincerity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite a lackluster response to her books and even <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2024/02/michiko-kakutani-new-york-times-book-critic-great-wave-review.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">searing critiques</a>, Kakutani will probably keep getting book contracts while far more talented and interesting writers struggle even with article pitches as <a href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2023/2023-news-deserts-report-penny-abernathy-medill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publications everywhere shutter</a> or <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/28/1172599212/web-buzzfeed-vice-gawker-facebook-twitter-media-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">struggle to find resources</a>. The <em>Book Review</em>, in all its stodgy glory, continues to exist. A <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?195760-1/inside-the-york-times-book-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2006</a> C-Span<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?326362-1/tour-new-york-times-book-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> interview </a>with its employees featured editors talking about the seemingly complicated processes that bring it to life, but the <em>Review</em> to date has no explanation for why a “best-selling” author like Miranda July might receive the attention of no fewer than three separate print pieces (invaluable real estate) and a podcast devoted to her latest book, <em>All Fours</em>, while independent publishers and debut writers struggle to get their copies seen. Does the <em>Book Review </em>create the market for a book or reflect it? How much of the coverage of July’s book has to do with her status as a Hollywood-adjacent influencer-style figure, possessed of the kind of glamor rarely seen in the publishing world? Even if it disappears tomorrow, the <em>Book Review</em>’s lasting legacy will be that it perpetuated the inequalities of a publishing world and replicated its false and damaging hierarchies by only paying attention to stardom or the potential thereof. It creates a demand for tired stories, repackaged endlessly in new guises and, too often, the publishing industry forces writers to write towards the <em>Book Review</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the course of its long existence, it has shaped literary tastes without any real commitment to appraisal or critique, and it has taken pride in its ability to carry on a tradition of nothingness, no real engagement with books, only an often smarmy, worshipful reverence for (certain) books and (certain) writers. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/18/books/smash-mouth-criticism.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a 2004 review of Dale Peck’s <em>Hatchet Jobs</em></a>, John Leonard—who hated the book—offered himself up as an exemplar of the best kind of critic. He reveals that, years ago, the <em>Times</em> had asked him to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/07/books/cheever-country.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review John Cheever’s last novel,</a> after the assignment had been turned down by many other critics who had balked because the book was not that good and they didn’t want to simply perform what Leonard called “a random act of kindness” to Cheever, who happened to be dying at the time. Leonard revealed, cheerily, that he was the one who agreed to review the novel because, “it never occurred to me that a thank-you note to a wonderful writer, a valediction as it were, would get me kicked out of any club I wanted to belong to, so I immediately said yes.” In other words, Leonard was unafraid to admit he had no integrity as a reviewer, and the <em>Times</em> was happy to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/07/books/cheever-country.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">print</a> his review.<sup><span>2</span></sup></p>

<p>As <em>Succession’</em>s Logan Roy might put it, these are not serious people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is easy to dismiss any criticism of the <em>Book Review</em> by claiming that it does not matter or that it is simply part of a mainstream publishing world. But as many writers know too well, the shoddy standards set by the <em>Review </em>have long tentacles, creating book markets even in the indie world (where trauma narratives and stock immigrant stories still seem to rule).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, much of the conversation around books and publishing ignores a vital fact: what we need is not a world where writers might aspire to gigantic advances or viral reviews to sell their books but one where they are supported in their work and are free to create and perhaps even fail—to tweak Dwyer’s judgmental term—in their endeavors without worrying about their next month’s rent or meals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We could continue to have long and ultimately meaningless conversations about “The Role of Critics and Criticism” (Emre has created something of a cottage industry in this realm of thought), but these usually ignore—and this bears repeating—the material conditions of publishing. Writers are not creative geniuses spinning books out of thin air but people who have to eat and find shelter while pursuing their work (the same is true of critics, unless, like Emre, they exist in that bubble somewhere between academia and influencer culture). Talking about the economics of publishing does not mean that books are rendered less meaningful or even, dare I say, less magical, less able to transport us from everyday life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But we can (and should) also think about books and their markets as elements of a constructed reality. A bestseller is marked as such by a meaningless gold star on a book cover, which tells us nothing about actual numbers, its quality, or whether a reader ought to read it. Whose books are reviewed or not depends on any number of unseen factors (including whether or not you are at the right parties or, you know, married to the right people). “Diversity” in publishing is often another way to compel non-white authors to provide cultural therapy to white readers.&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>Online and real-life discussions about the influence of the <em>Book Review</em> (waning or not) often <a href="https://www.autumnhouse.org/support-for-independent-publishers-is-more-important-now-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">result in calls to support more independent publishers</a>, who cannot afford to hand out sustainable advances to writers. The underlying logic here is that writers are on their own: if a writer truly wants to write, they will simply find a way. But this assumes that a writer is not a professional writer consumed by their work but, rather, someone who works on the side, perhaps after a long day at work or on the weekends, for whom writing is a hobby. Such an attitude also leaves untouched the world created by the <em>Book Review</em>, where only a few authors receive massive advances (<a href="https://theweek.com/articles/471659/lena-dunhams-new-advice-bookreally-worth-35-million-advance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lena Dunham’s $3.5 million</a> comes to mind, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/3/2/14779892/barack-michelle-obama-65-million-book-deal-penguin-random-house" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as does the Obamas’ $65 million</a>) and others don’t make enough to actually live on but must still, somehow, write. In the meantime, too many writers are persuaded by publications like <em>Esquire</em> that they will be the Special Ones to get big advances when, in fact, the system is rigged. This ecosystem, where writing is simply not considered labor, remains untouched.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The solution is not to continue the dichotomous system where the <em>Book Review</em> and its kin survive by only reviewing Big Five or academic publishers while indie presses (supposedly) deliver different fare. It is also not to fetishize ill-paid “indie” writing and the idea that good writers will just keep writing, because that simply means that “good” writers will also have to be independently wealthy to even write for small presses. For any real change to occur, we have to strip bare the fabrications and confabulations upon which so much of the publishing industry is built. Revealing the cracks and regimes of power within the <em>NYT</em>’s <em>Book Review</em> is only a start. To build a new ecosystem means admitting that the old one is rotten to the core. Karl Marx, as we have pointed out several times in this <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/2023/12/on-the-material-foundations-of-intellectual-production" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">magazine</a>, had to keep pawning his winter coat to survive and could never have produced his work without the financial support of Friedrich Engels. What is true of the original Marxist is also true of countless novelists who have relied on friends, families, lovers, and clients to help keep them writing.</p>

<p>We can fantasize about and through books all we want, but we cannot wish away the fact that books are made in and of the world itself. This includes the books we’ll never read because writers have been denied the means to create them.</p>

	<p>
		While much attention has been focused on high-level software
		architectural patterns, what is, in effect, the de-facto standard
		software architecture is seldom discussed. This paper examines this
		most frequently deployed of software architectures: the <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a>. A <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> is a casually, even
		haphazardly, structured system. Its organization, if one can call it
		that, is dictated more by expediency than design. Yet, its enduring
		popularity cannot merely be indicative of a general disregard for
		architecture.
	</p>

	<p>
		These patterns explore the forces that encourage the emergence of a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a>, and the undeniable
		effectiveness of this approach to software architecture. What are the
		people who build them doing right? If more high-minded architectural
		approaches are to compete, we must understand what the forces that
		lead to a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> are, and
		examine alternative ways to resolve them.
	</p>

	<p>
		A number of additional patterns emerge out of the <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a>. We discuss them in
		turn. Two principal questions underlie these patterns: Why are so many
		existing systems architecturally undistinguished, and what can we do
		to improve them?
	</p>

	<!-- Pattern Header -->
	<a name="Introduction"></a>
	
	<!-- End of Pattern Header -->

	<p>
		Over the last several years, a number of authors [Garlan &amp; Shaw
		1993] [Shaw 1996] [Buschmann et. al. 1996] [Meszaros 1997] have
		presented patterns that characterize high-level software
		architectures, such as PIPELINE and LAYERED ARCHITECTURE. In an ideal
		world, every system would be an exemplar of one or more such
		high-level patterns. Yet, this is not so. The architecture that
		actually predominates in practice has yet to be discussed: the <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a>.
	</p>

	<a href="http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~ba116594/mmt.html"> <img src="http://laputan.org/images/pictures/spaghetti-medium.jpg" width="317" height="437" alt="Lennon Serves Too Much Spaghetti"></a>
	<p>
		A <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> is haphazardly
		structured, sprawling, sloppy, duct-tape and bailing wire, <a href="http://www.mdagroup.com/computing/spaghett.htm">spaghetti</a> <a href="http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~dkw/C-humor/pasta.txt">code</a> <a href="http://leb.net/~tonyk/jargon/entry.cgi?idx=1710">jungle</a>.
		We’ve all seen them. These systems show unmistakable signs of
		unregulated growth, and repeated, <a href="http://home.swbell.net/mck9/cobol/style/rewrite.html">expedient</a>
		repair. Information is shared promiscuously among distant elements of
		the system, often to the point where nearly all the important
		information becomes global or duplicated. The overall structure of the
		system may never have been well defined. If it was, it may have <a href="http://garynorth.com/y2k/detail_.cfm/881">eroded</a> beyond
		recognition. Programmers with a shred of architectural sensibility
		shun these quagmires. Only those who are unconcerned about
		architecture, and, perhaps, are comfortable with the inertia of the
		day-to-day chore of patching the holes in these failing dikes, are
		content to work on such systems.
	</p>

	<p>Still, this approach endures and thrives. Why is this
		architecture so popular? Is it as bad as it seems, or might it serve
		as a way-station on the road to more enduring, elegant artifacts? What
		forces drive good programmers to build ugly systems? Can we avoid
		this? Should we? How can we make such systems better?</p>

	<p>We present the following seven patterns:</p>

		</p>
	</dir>

	<p>
		Why does a system become a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a>? Sometimes, big, ugly systems emerge from <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode"></a><a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode">THROWAWAY
			CODE</a>. <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode">THROWAWAY CODE</a> is
		quick-and-dirty code that was intended to be used only once and then
		discarded. However, such code often takes on a life of its own,
		despite casual structure and poor or non-existent documentation. It
		works, so why fix it? When a related problem arises, the quickest way
		to address it might be to expediently modify this working code, rather
		than design a proper, general program from the ground up. Over time, a
		simple throwaway program begets a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Even systems with well-defined architectures are prone to structural
		erosion. The relentless onslaught of changing requirements that any
		successful system attracts can gradually undermine its structure.
		Systems that were once tidy become overgrown as <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL GROWTH</a> gradually allows
		elements of the system to sprawl in an uncontrolled fashion.
	</p>

	<p>
		If such sprawl continues unabated, the structure of the system can
		become so badly compromised that it must be abandoned. As with a
		decaying neighborhood, a downward spiral ensues. Since the system
		becomes harder and harder to understand, maintenance becomes more
		expensive, and more difficult. Good programmers refuse to work there.
		Investors withdraw their capital. And yet, as with neighborhoods,
		there are ways to avoid, and even reverse, this sort of decline. As
		with anything else in the universe, counteracting entropic forces
		requires an investment of energy. Software <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?gentrification">gentrification</a>
		is no exception. The way to arrest entropy in software is to refactor
		it. A sustained commitment to refactoring can keep a system from
		subsiding into a BIG BALL OF MUD.
	</p>

	<p>
		A major flood, fire, or war may require that a city be evacuated and
		rebuilt from the ground up. More often, change takes place a building
		or block at a time, while the city as a whole continues to function.
		Once established, a strategy of <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#KeepItWorking">KEEPING
			IT WORKING</a> preserves a municipality’s vitality as it grows.
	</p>

	<p>
		Systems and their constituent elements evolve at different rates. As
		they do, things that change quickly tend to become distinct from
		things that change more slowly. The <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ShearingLayers">SHEARING
			LAYERS</a> that develop between them are like fault lines or facets that
		help foster the emergence of enduring abstractions.
	</p>

	<p>
		A simple way to begin to control decline is to cordon off the blighted
		areas, and put an attractive fa�ade around them. We call this strategy
		<a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#SweepingItUnderTheRug">SWEEPING IT UNDER THE RUG</a>.
		In more advanced cases, there may be no alternative but to tear
		everything down and start over. When total <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#Reconstruction">RECONSTRUCTION</a> becomes necessary,
		all that is left to salvage is the patterns that underlie the
		experience.
	</p>

	<p>Some of these patterns might appear at first to be antipatterns
		[Brown et al. 1998] or straw men, but they are not, at least in the
		customary sense. Instead, they seek to examine the gap between what we
		preach and what we practice.</p>

	<p>Still, some of them may strike some readers as having a schizoid
		quality about them. So, for the record, let us put our cards on the
		table. We are in favor of good architecture.</p>

	<p>Our ultimate agenda is to help drain these swamps. Where
		possible, architectural decline should be prevented, arrested, or
		reversed. We discuss ways of doing this. In severe cases,
		architectural abominations may even need to be demolished.</p>

	<p>At the same time, we seek not to cast blame upon those who must
		wallow in these mires. In part, our attitude is to "hate the sin, but
		love the sinner". But, it goes beyond this. Not every backyard storage
		shack needs marble columns. There are significant forces that can
		conspire to compel architecture to take a back seat to functionality,
		particularly early in the evolution of a software artifact.
		Opportunities and insights that can allow for architectural progress
		often are present later rather than earlier in the lifecycle.</p>

	<p>A certain amount of controlled chaos is natural during
		construction, and can be tolerated, as long as you clean up after
		yourself eventually. Even beyond this though, a complex system may be
		an accurate reflection of our immature understanding of a complex
		problem. The class of systems that we can build at all may be larger
		than the class of systems we can build elegantly, at least at first. A
		somewhat ramshackle rat's nest might be a state-of-the-art
		architecture for a poorly understood domain. This should not be the
		end of the story, though. As we gain more experience in such domains,
		we should increasingly direct our energies to gleaning more enduring
		architectural abstractions from them.</p>

	<p>
		The patterns described herein are not intended to stand alone. They
		are instead set in a context that includes a number of other patterns
		that we and others have described. In particular, they are set in
		contrast to the lifecycle patterns, <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/user/cope/Patterns/Process/section38.html">PROTOTYPE</a>
		<a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Prototype">PHASE</a>, <a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Expand">EXPANSIONARY PHASE</a>, and
		<a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Consolidate">CONSOLIDATION
			PHASE</a>, presented in [<a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html">Foote
			&amp; Opdyke 1995</a>] and [Coplien 1995], the <a href="http://laputan.org/metamorphosis/metamorphosis.html#SoftwareTectonics">SOFTWARE
			TECTONICS</a> pattern in [<a href="http://laputan.org/metamorphosis/metamorphosis.html#SoftwareTectonics">Foote
			&amp; Yoder 1996</a>], and the framework development patterns in [<a href="http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/~droberts/evolve.html">Roberts
			&amp; Johnson 1998</a>].
	</p>

	<p>Indeed, to a substantial extent, much of this chapter describes
		the disease, while the patterns above describe what we believe can be
		the cure: a flexible, adaptive, feedback-driven development process in
		which design and refactoring pervade the lifecycle of each artifact,
		component, and framework, within and beyond the applications that
		incubate them.</p>

		A number of forces can conspire to drive even the most architecturally
		conscientious organizations to produce <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALLS OF MUD</a>. These pervasive, <i>"global" forces</i> are
		at work in all the patterns presented. Among these forces:
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Time:</i> There may not be enough <u>time</u> to consider the <a href="http://www.longnow.org/">long-term</a> architectural
		implications of one’s design and implementation decisions. Even
		when systems have been well designed, architectural concerns often
		must yield to more pragmatic ones as a deadline starts to loom.
	</p>

	<p>
		One reason that software architectures are so often mediocre is that
		architecture frequently takes a back seat to more mundane concerns
		such as cost, time-to-market, and programmer skill. Architecture is
		often seen as a luxury or a frill, or the indulgent pursuit of
		lily-gilding compulsives who have no concern for the bottom line.
		Architecture is often treated with neglect, and even disdain. While
		such attitudes are unfortunate, they are not hard to understand.
		Architecture is a long-term concern. The concerns above have to be
		addressed if a product is not to be stillborn in the marketplace,
		while the benefits of good architecture are realized later in the
		lifecycle, as frameworks mature, and reusable black-box components
		emerge [<a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html">Foote &amp; Opdyke
			1995</a>].
	</p>

	<p>
		Architecture can be looked upon as a <i>Risk</i>, that will consume
		resources better directed at meeting a fleeting market window, or as
		an <i>Opportunity</i> to lay the groundwork for a commanding advantage
		down the road.
	</p>

	<p>Indeed, an immature architecture can be an advantage in a
		growing system because data and functionality can migrate to their
		natural places in the system unencumbered by artificial architectural
		constraints. Premature architecture can be more dangerous than none at
		all, as unproved architectural hypotheses turn into straightjackets
		that discourage evolution and experimentation.</p>

	<p>
		<i>Cost:</i> Architecture is expensive, especially when a new domain
		is being explored. Getting the system right seems like a pointless
		luxury once the system is limping well enough to ship. An investment
		in architecture usually does not pay off immediately. Indeed, if
		architectural concerns delay a product’s market entry for too
		long, then long-term concerns may be moot. Who benefits from an
		investment in architecture, and when is a return on this investment
		seen? Money spent on a quick-and-dirty project that allows an
		immediate entry into the market may be better spent than money spent
		on elaborate, speculative architectural fishing expedition. It’s
		hard to recover the value of your architectural assets if you’ve
		long since gone bankrupt.
	</p>

	<p>Programmers with the ability to discern and design quality
		architectures are reputed to command a premium. These expenses must be
		weighed against those of allowing an expensive system to slip into
		premature decline and obsolescence. If you think good architecture is
		expensive, try bad architecture.</p>

	<p>
		<i>Experience:</i> Even when one has the time and inclination to take
		architectural concerns into account, one’s experience, or lack
		thereof, with the domain can limit the degree of architectural
		sophistication that can be brought to a system, particularly early in
		its evolution. Some programmers flourish in environments where they
		can discover and develop new abstractions, while others are more
		comfortable in more constrained environments (for instance, Smalltalk
		vs. <a href="http://www.hamline.edu/~wnk/cpb/199707/0884.html">Visual
			Basic</a> programmers.) Often, initial versions of a system are vehicles
		whereby programmers learn what pieces must be brought into play to
		solve a particular problem. Only after these are identified do the
		architectural boundaries among parts of the system start to emerge.
	</p>

	<p>Inexperience can take a number of guises. There is absolute,
		fresh out of school inexperience. A good architect may lack domain
		experience, or a domain expert who knows the code cold may not have
		architectural experience.</p>

	<p>Employee turnover can wreak havoc on an organization’s
		institutional memory, with the perhaps dubious consolation of bringing
		fresh blood aboard.</p>

	<p>
		<i>Skill:</i> Programmers differ in their levels of skill, as well as
		in expertise, predisposition and temperament. Some programmers have a
		passion for finding good abstractions, while some are skilled at
		navigating the swamps of complex code left to them by others.
		Programmers differ tremendously in their degrees of experience with
		particular domains, and their capacities for adapting to new ones.
		Programmers differ in their language and tool preferences and
		experience as well.
	</p>


	<p>
		<i>Visibility:</i> Buildings are tangible, physical structures. You
		can look at a building. You can watch it being built. You can walk
		inside it, and admire and critique its design.
	</p>

	<p>A program’s user interface presents the public face of a
		program, much as a building’s exterior manifests its
		architecture. However, unlike buildings, only the people who build a
		program see how it looks inside.</p>

	<p>Programs are made of bits. The manner in which we present these
		bits greatly affects our sense of how they are put together. Some
		designers prefer to see systems depicted using modeling languages or
		PowerPoint pictures. Others prefer prose descriptions. Still others
		prefer to see code. The fashion in which we present our architectures
		affects our perceptions of whether they are good or bad, clear or
		muddled, and elegant or muddy.</p>

	<p>Indeed, one of the reasons that architecture is neglected is
		that much of it is "under the hood", where nobody can see
		it. If the system works, and it can be shipped, who cares what it
		looks like on the inside?</p>

	<p>
		<i>Complexity:</i> One reason for a muddled architecture is that
		software often reflects the inherent complexity of the application
		domain. This is what <a href="http://groucho.admin.unc.edu/endeavors/end496/brooks.htm">Brooks</a>
		called "essential complexity" [Brooks 1995]. In other words,
		the software is ugly because the problem is ugly, or at least not well
		understood. Frequently, the organization of the system reflects the
		sprawl and history of the organization that built it (as per <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/user/cope/Patterns/Process/section15.html">CONWAY’S
			LAW</a> [Coplien 1995]) and the compromises that were made along the way.
		Renegotiating these relationships is often difficult once the basic
		boundaries among system elements are drawn. These relationships can
		take on the immutable character of "site" boundaries that <a href="http://www.well.com/user/sbb/index.html"> Brand</a> [Brand
		1994] observed in real cities. Big problems can arises when the needs
		of the applications force unrestrained communication across these
		boundaries. The system becomes a tangled mess, and what little
		structure is there can erode further.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Change:</i> Architecture is a hypothesis about the future that
		holds that subsequent change will be confined to that part of the
		design space encompassed by that architecture. Of course, the world
		has a way of mocking our attempts to make such predictions by tossing
		us the totally unexpected. A problem we might have been told was
		definitely ruled out of consideration for all time may turn out to be
		dear to the heart of a new client we never thought we’d have.
		Such changes may cut directly across the grain of fundamental
		architectural decisions made in the light of the certainty that these
		new contingencies could never arise. The "right" thing to do
		might be to redesign the system. The more likely result is that the
		architecture of the system will be expediently perturbed to address
		the new requirements, with only passing regard for the effect of these
		radical changes on the structure of the system.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Scale:</i> Managing a large project is a qualitatively different
		problem from managing a small one, just as leading a division of
		infantry into battle is different from commanding a small special
		forces team. Obviously, "divide and conquer" is, in general, an
		insufficient answer to the problems posed by scale. Alan Kay, during
		an invited talk at OOPSLA '86 observed that "good ideas don't always
		scale." That observation prompted <a href="http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/people/lieber/">Henry
			Lieberman</a> to inquire "so what do we do, just scale the bad ones?"

	</p>

	<p>
		<a href="http://www.interlog.com/~rodneyb/paraguay/shantypix.html">Shantytowns</a>
		are squalid, sprawling slums. Everyone seems to agree they are a bad
		idea, but forces conspire to promote their emergence anyway. What is
		it that they are doing right?
	</p>

	<p>Shantytowns are usually built from common, inexpensive materials
		and simple tools. Shantytowns can be built using relatively unskilled
		labor. Even though the labor force is "unskilled" in the
		customary sense, the construction and maintenance of this sort of
		housing can be quite labor intensive. There is little specialization.
		Each housing unit is constructed and maintained primarily by its
		inhabitants, and each inhabitant must be a jack of all the necessary
		trades. There is little concern for infrastructure, since
		infrastructure requires coordination and capital, and specialized
		resources, equipment, and skills. There is little overall planning or
		regulation of growth. Shantytowns emerge where there is a need for
		housing, a surplus of unskilled labor, and a dearth of capital
		investment. Shantytowns fulfill an immediate, local need for housing
		by bringing available resources to bear on the problem. Loftier
		architectural goals are a luxury that has to wait.</p>

	<p>Maintaining a shantytown is labor-intensive and requires a broad
		range of skills. One must be able to improvise repairs with the
		materials on-hand, and master tasks from roof repair to ad hoc
		sanitation. However, there is little of the sort of skilled
		specialization that one sees in a mature economy.</p>

	<p>All too many of our software systems are, architecturally,
		little more than shantytowns. Investment in tools and infrastructure
		is too often inadequate. Tools are usually primitive, and
		infrastructure such as libraries and frameworks, is undercapitalized.
		Individual portions of the system grow unchecked, and the lack of
		infrastructure and architecture allows problems in one part of the
		system to erode and pollute adjacent portions. Deadlines loom like
		monsoons, and architectural elegance seems unattainable.</p>

	</p>
	<p>As a system nears completion, its actual users may begin to work
		with it for the first time. This experience may inspire changes to
		data formats and the user interface that undermine architectural
		decisions that had been thought to be settled. Also, as Brooks [Brooks
		1995] has noted, because software is so flexible, it is often asked to
		bear the burden of architectural compromises late in the development
		cycle of hardware/software deliverables precisely because of its
		flexibility.</p>

	<p>
		This phenomenon is not unique to software. <a href="http://www.well.com/user/sbb/index.html">Stewart Brand</a>
		[Brand 1994] has observed that the period just prior to a
		building’s initial occupancy can be a stressful period for both
		architects and their clients. The money is running out, and the
		finishing touches are being put on just those parts of the space that
		will interact the most with its occupants. During this period, it can
		become evident that certain wish-list items are not going to make it,
		and that exotic experiments are not going to work. Compromise becomes
		the "order of the day".
	</p>

	<p>The time and money to chase perfection are seldom available, nor
		should they be. To survive, we must do what it takes to get our
		software working and out the door on time. Indeed, if a team completes
		a project with time to spare, today’s managers are likely to take
		that as a sign to provide less time and money or fewer people the next
		time around.</p>

	<p><span><b>You need to deliver quality
						software on time, and under budget.</b></span></p>

	<p>
		<i>Cost</i>: Architecture is a long-term investment. It is easy for
		the people who are paying the bills to dismiss it, unless there is
		some tangible immediate benefit, such a tax write-off, or unless
		surplus money and time happens to be available. Such is seldom the
		case. More often, the customer needs something working by tomorrow.
		Often, the people who control and manage the development process
		simply do not regard architecture as a pressing concern. If
		programmers know that workmanship is invisible, and managers don't
		want to pay for it anyway, a vicious circle is born.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Skill</i>: Ralph Johnson is fond of observing that is inevitable
		that "on average, average organizations will have average people". One
		reason for the popularity and success of <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> approaches might be
		that this appoach doesn't require a hyperproductive <a href="http://www.onenet.net/~njtdb/casey.html">virtuoso</a> architect
		at every keyboard.
	</p><p>
		<i>Organization</i>: With larger projects, cultural, process,
		organizational and resource allocation issues can overwhelm technical
		concerns such as tools, languages, and architecture.
	</p>

	<p>It may seem to a programmer that whether to don hip boots and
		wade into a swamp is a major quality-of-life matter, but programmer
		comfort is but one concern to a manager, which can conflict with many
		others. Architecture and code quality may strike management as frills
		that have only an indirect impact on their bottom lines.
	</p><p><b><span><u><i>Therefore</i></u>,
						focus first on features and functionality, then focus on
						architecture and performance. </span></b></p>

	<p>
		The case made here resembles Gabriel’s "<a href="http://laputan.org/gabriel/worse-is-better.html">Worse is Better</a>"
		arguments [Gabriel 1991] in a number of respects. Why does so much
		software, despite the best intentions and efforts of developers, turn
		into <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALLS OF MUD</a>? Why do
		slash-and-burn tactics drive out elegance? Does bad architecture drive
		out good architecture?
	</p>

	<p>What does this muddy code look like to the programmers in the
		trenches who must confront it? Data structures may be haphazardly
		constructed, or even next to non-existent. Everything talks to
		everything else. Every shred of important state data may be global.
		There are those who might construe this as a sort of blackboard
		approach [Buschmann 1996], but it more closely resembles a grab bag of
		undifferentiated state. Where state information is compartmentalized,
		it may be passed promiscuously about though Byzantine back channels
		that circumvent the system's original structure.</p>

	<p>Variable and function names might be uninformative, or even
		misleading. Functions themselves may make extensive use of global
		variables, as well as long lists of poorly defined parameters. The
		function themselves are lengthy and convoluted, and perform several
		unrelated tasks. Code is duplicated. The flow of control is hard to
		understand, and difficult to follow. The programmer’s intent is
		next to impossible to discern. The code is simply unreadable, and
		borders on indecipherable. The code exhibits the unmistakable signs of
		patch after patch at the hands of multiple maintainers, each of whom
		barely understood the consequences of what he or she was doing. Did we
		mention documentation? What documentation?</p>

	<p>
		<a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> might be thought
		of as an anti-pattern, since our intention is to show how passivity in
		the face of forces that undermine architecture can lead to a quagmire.
		However, its undeniable popularity leads to the inexorable conclusion
		that it is a pattern in its own right. It is certainly a pervasive,
		recurring solution to the problem of producing a working system in the
		context of software development. It would seem to be the path of least
		resistance when one confronts the sorts of forces discussed above.
		Only by understanding the logic of its appeal can we channel or
		counteract the forces that lead to a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a>.
	</p>

	<p>One thing that isn’t the answer is rigid, totalitarian,
		top-down design. Some analysts, designers, and architects have an
		exaggerated sense of their ability to get things right up-front,
		before moving into implementation. This approach leads to inefficient
		resources utilization, analysis paralysis, and design straightjackets
		and cul-de-sacs.</p>

	<p>Kent Beck has observed that the way to build software is to:
		Make it work. Make it right. Make it fast [Beck 1997]. "Make it
		work" means that we should focus on functionality up-front, and
		get something running. "Make it right" means that we should
		concern ourselves with how to structure the system only after
		we’ve figured out the pieces we need to solve the problem in the
		first place. "Make it fast" means that we should be
		concerned about optimizing performance only after we’ve learned
		how to solve the problem, and after we’ve discerned an
		architecture to elegantly encompass this functionality. Once all this
		has been done, one can consider how to make it cheap.</p>

	<p>
		When it comes to software architecture, form <u>follows</u> function.
		Here we mean "follows" not in the traditional sense of dictating
		function. Instead, we mean that the distinct identities of the
		system�s architectural elements often don�t start to emerge until <u>after</u>
		the code is working.
	</p>

	<p>Domain experience is an essential ingredient in any framework
		design effort. It is hard to try to follow a front-loaded, top-down
		design process under the best of circumstances. Without knowing the
		architectural demands of the domain, such an attempt is premature, if
		not foolhardy. Often, the only way to get domain experience early in
		the lifecycle is to hire someone who has worked in a domain before
		from someone else.</p>

	<p>The quality of one’s tools can influence a system’s
		architecture. If a system’s architectural goals are inadequately
		communicated among members of a team, they will be harder to take into
		account as the system is designed and constructed.</p>

	<p>
		Finally, engineers will differ in their levels of skill and commitment
		to architecture. Sadly, architecture has been undervalued for so long
		that many engineers regard life with a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a> as normal. Indeed some engineers are particularly skilled
		at learning to navigate these quagmires, and guiding others through
		them. Over time, this symbiosis between architecture and skills can
		change the character of the organization itself, as swamp guides
		become more valuable than architects. As per <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/user/cope/Patterns/Process/section15.html">CONWAY’S
			LAW</a> [Coplien 1995], architects depart in futility, while engineers
		who have mastered the muddy details of the system they have built in
		their images prevail. [<a href="http://laputan.org/selfish/selfish.html#LowSurfaceToVolumeRatio">Foote
			&amp; Yoder 1998a</a>] went so far as to observe that inscrutable code
		might, in fact, have a survival advantage over good code, by virtue of
		being difficult to comprehend and change. This advantage can extend to
		those programmers who can find their ways around such code. In a land
		devoid of landmarks, such guides may become indispensable.
	</p>

	<p>The incentives that drive the evolution of such systems can, at
		times, operate perversely. Just as it is easier to be verbose than
		concise, it is easier to build complex systems than it is to build
		simple ones. Skilled programmers may be able to create complexity more
		quickly than their peers, and more quickly than they can document and
		explain it. Like an army outrunning its logistics train, complexity
		increases until it reaches the point where such programmers can no
		longer reliably cope with it.</p>

	<p>
		This is akin to a phenonmenon dubbed the <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?PeterPrincipleProgramming"><i>PeterPrinciple
				of Programming</i></a> by authors on the Wiki-Wiki web [Cunninghan 1999a].
		Complexity increases rapidly until the it reaches a level of
		complexity just beyond that with which programmers can comfortably
		cope. At this point, complexity and our abilities to contain it reach
		an uneasy equilibrium. The blitzkrieg bogs down into a siege. We built
		<a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheMostComplexWhichCanBeMadeToWork">
			the most complicated system that can possible work</a> [Cunningham
		1999b].
	</p>
	<a href="http://www.45thdivisionmuseum.com/Mainmuseum/Mauldin2.htm">
		<img src="http://laputan.org/images/pictures/mauldin-warm-mud.gif">
	</a>

	<p>Such code can become a personal fiefdom, since the author care
		barely understand it anymore, and no one else can come close. Once
		simple repairs become all day affairs, as the code turns to mud. It
		becomes increasingly difficult for management to tell how long such
		repairs ought to take. Simple objectives turn into trench warfare.
		Everyone becomes resigned to a turgid pace. Some even come to prefer
		it, hiding in their cozy foxholes, and making their two line-per-day
		repairs.</p>

	<p>It is interesting to ask whether some of the differences in
		productivity seen between hyper-productive organizations and typical
		shops are due not to differences in talent, but differences in
		terrain. Mud is hard to march through. The hacker in the trenches must
		engage complexity in hand-to-hand combat every day. Sometimes,
		complexity wins.</p>

	<p>Status in the programmer's primate pecking order is often earned
		through ritual displays of cleverness, rather than through
		workman-like displays of simplicity and clarity. That which a culture
		glorifies will flourish.</p>

	<p>
		Yet, a case can be made that the casual, undifferentiated structure of
		a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> is one of its
		secret advantages, since forces acting between two parts of the system
		can be directly addressed without having to worry about undermining
		the system’s grander architectural aspirations. These aspirations
		are modest ones at best in the typical <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a>. Indeed, a casual approach to architecture is emblematic
		of the early phases of a system’s evolution, as programmers,
		architects and users learn their way around the domain [<a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Prototype">Foote &amp; Opdyke
			1995</a>]. During the <a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Prototype">PROTOTYPE</a>
		and <a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Expand">EXPANSIONARY
			PHASES</a> of a systems evolution, expedient, white-box inheritance-based
		code borrowing, and a relaxed approach to encapsulation are common.
		Later, as experience with the system accrues, the grain of the
		architectural domain becomes discernable, and more durable black-box
		components begin to emerge. In other words, it’s okay if the
		system looks at first like a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a>, at least until you know better.

		during the '70s as a <a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~hollan/cs257/description.html">characterization</a>

	<p>
		<a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> architectures
		often emerge from throw-away prototypes, or <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode">THROWAWAY CODE</a>, because the
		prototype is kept, or the disposable code is never disposed of. (One
		might call these "<a href="http://www.muang.com/rice/plant.html">little
			balls of mud</a>".)
	</p>

	<p>
		They also can emerge as gradual maintenance and <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL GROWTH</a> impinges upon
		the structure of a mature system. Once a system is working, a good way
		to encourage its growth is to <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#KeepItWorking">KEEP
			IT WORKING</a>. When the <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ShearingLayers">SHEARING
			LAYERS</a> that emerge as change drives the system's evolution run
		against the existing grain of the system, its structure can be
		undermined, and the result can be a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Prototype">PROTOTYPE
			PHASE</a> and <a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Expand">EXPANSION
			PHASE</a> patterns in [<a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html">Foote
			&amp; Opdyke 1995</a>] both emphasize that a period of exploration and
		experimentation is often beneficial before making enduring
		architectural commitments.
	</p>

	<p>
		However, these activities, which can undermine a system's structure
		should be interspersed with <a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Consolidate">CONSOLIDATION
			PHASES</a> [<a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html">Foote &amp; Opdyke
			1995</a>], during which opportunities to refactor the system to enhance
		its structure are exploited. Proponents of <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/">Extreme Programming</a> [Beck
		2000] also emphasize continuous coding and refactoring.
	</p>

	<p>
		[Brand 1994] observes that buildings with large spaces punctuated with
		regular columns had the paradoxical effect of encouraging the
		innovative reuse of space precisely <u>because</u> they <a href="http://laputan.org/chaos/chaos.html"><i>constrained</i></a> the design space.
		Grandiose flights of architectural fancy weren’t possible, which
		reduced the number of design alternatives that could be put on the
		table. Sometimes <a href="http://laputan.org/dfc/discussion.html#O2isEasy">FREEDOM
			FROM CHOICE</a> [Foote 1988] is what we <u>really</u> want.
	</p>

	<p>One of mud's most effective enemies is sunshine. Subjecting
		convoluted code to scrutiny can set the stage for its refactoring,
		repair, and rehabilitation. Code reviews are one mechanism one can use
		to expose code to daylight.</p>

	<p>
		Another is the <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/">Extreme
			Programming</a> practice of pair programming [Beck 2000]. A pure pair
		programming approach requires that every line of code written be added
		to the system with two programmers present. One types, or "drives",
		while the other "rides shotgun" and looks on. In contrast to
		traditional solitary software production practices, pair programming
		subjects code to immediate scrutiny, and provides a means by which
		knowledge about the system is rapidly disseminated.
	</p>

	<p>Indeed, reviews and pair programming provide programmers with
		something their work would not otherwise have: an audience. Sunlight,
		it is said is a powerful disinfectant. Pair-practices add an element
		of performance to programming. An immediate audience of one's peers
		provides immediate incentives to programmers to keep their code clear
		and comprehensible, as well as functional.</p>

	<p>
		An additional benefit of pairing is that accumulated wisdom and best
		practices can be <a href="http://laputan.org/chaos/chaos.html">rapidly
			disseminated</a> throughout an organization through successive pairings.
		This is, incidentally, the same benefit that sexual reproduction
		brought to the genome.
	</p>

	<p>By contrast, if no one ever looks at code, everyone is free to
		think they are better than average at producing it. Programmers will,
		instead, respond to those relatively perverse incentives that do
		exist. Line of code metrics, design documents, and other indirect
		measurements of progress and quality can become central concerns.</p>

	<p>
		There are three ways to deal with <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALLS OF MUD</a>. The first is to keep the system healthy.
		Conscientiously alternating periods of <a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Expand">EXPANSION</a> with periods
		of <a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Consolidate">CONSOLIDATION</a>,
		refactoring and repair can maintain, and even enhance a system's
		structure as it evolves. The second is to throw the system away and
		start over. The <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#Reconstruction">RECONSTRUCTION</a>
		pattern explores this drastic, but frequently necessary alternative.
		The third is to simply surrender to entropy, and wallow in the mire.

		Since the time of Roman architect <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/vit/www/index.html">Marcus
			Vitruvius</a>, [<a href="http://www.ukans.edu/history/index/europe/ancient_rome/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/home*.html">Vitruvius
			20 B.C.</a>] architects have focused on his trinity of desirables: <i>Firmitas</i>
		(<b>strength</b>), <i>Utilitas</i> (<b>utility</b>), and <i>Venustas</i>
		(<b>beauty</b>). A <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a>
		usually represents a triumph of utility over aesthetics, because
		workmanship is sacrificed for functionality. Structure and durability
		can be sacrificed as well, because an incomprehensible program defies
		attempts at maintenance. The frenzied, feature-driven "bloatware"
		phenomenon seen in many large consumer software products can be seen
		as evidence of designers having allowed purely utilitarian concerns to
		dominate software design.

	<p>A homeowner might erect a temporary storage shed or car port,
		with every intention of quickly tearing it down and replacing it with
		something more permanent. Such structures have a way of enduring
		indefinitely. The money expected to replace them might not become
		available. Or, once the new structure is constructed, the temptation
		to continue to use the old one for "a while" might be hard
		to resist.</p>

	<p>Likewise, when you are prototyping a system, you are not usually
		concerned with how elegant or efficient your code is. You know that
		you will only use it to prove a concept. Once the prototype is done,
		the code will be thrown away and written properly. As the time nears
		to demonstrate the prototype, the temptation to load it with
		impressive but utterly inefficient realizations of the system’s
		expected eventual functionality can be hard to resist. Sometimes, this
		strategy can be a bit too successful. The client, rather than funding
		the next phase of the project, may slate the prototype itself for

		<span><i>Time</i>, or a lack thereof, is frequently the

	<p>
		<span> Quick-and-dirty coding is often rationalized as being a

	<p>
		<a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode">THROWAWAY CODE</a> is often written
		as an alternative to reusing someone else’s more complex code.
		When the deadline looms, the certainty that you can produce a sloppy

	<p>
		Programmers are usually not domain experts, especially at first. Use

		nothing beats building a prototype to help a team learn its way around
		a domain.
	</p>

	<p>When you build a prototype, there is always the risk that

	Not every program need be a palace. A simple throwaway program is like

	The real problem with
	<p>
		<a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode">THROWAWAY CODE</a> comes when it
		isn't thrown away.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span face="Wingdings">v</span><span> </span><span face="Wingdings">v</span><span>

	</p>
	<p>
		The production of <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode">THROWAWAY CODE</a>
		is a nearly universal practice. Any software developer, at any skill
		or experience level, can be expected to have had at least occasional
		first-hand experience with this approach to software development. For
		example, in the patterns community, two examples of quick-and-dirty
		code that have endured are the <a href="http://jerry.cs.uiuc.edu/plop/chili98/chili-register.html">PLoP
			online registration</a> code, and the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors">Wiki-Wiki Web</a>
		pages.
	</p>

	<p>The EuroPLoP/PLoP/UP online registration code was, in effect, a
		distributed web-based application that ran on four different machines
		on two continents. Conference information was maintained on a machine
		in St. Louis, while registration records were kept on machines in
		Illinois and Germany. The system could generate web-based reports of
		registration activity, and now even instantaneously maintaineed an
		online attendees list. It began life in 1995 as a quick-and-dirty
		collection of HTML, scavenged C demonstration code, and csh scripts.
		It was undertaken largely as an experiment in web-based form
		processing prior to PLoP ‘95, and, like so many things on the
		Web, succeeded considerably beyond the expectations of its authors.
		Today, it is still essentially the same collection of HTML, scavenged
		C demonstration code, and csh scripts. As such, it showcases how
		quick-and-dirty code can, when successful, take on a life of its own.</p>

	<p>The original C code and scripts probably contained fewer than
		three dozen original lines of code. Many lines were cut-and-paste jobs
		that differed only in the specific text they generate, or fields that
		they check.</p>

	<p>Here’s an example of one of the scripts that generates the
		attendance report:</p>
	<span face="Lucida Sans Typewriter" size="2">

		<p>
			echo "&lt;H2&gt;Registrations: &lt;B&gt;" `ls | wc -l`
			"&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;"<br> echo
			"&lt;CODE&gt;"<br> echo "Authors: &lt;B&gt;"
			`grep 'Author = Yes' * | wc -l` "&lt;/B&gt;"<br> echo
			"&lt;BR&gt;"<br> echo "Non-Authors:
			&lt;B&gt;" `grep 'Author = No' * | wc -l` "&lt;/B&gt;"<br>
			echo "&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"
		</p>
	</span>

	<p>
		This script is slow and inefficient, particularly as the number of
		registrations increases, but not least among its virtues is the fact
		that it<i> works</i>. Were the number of attendees to exceed more than
		around one hundred, this script would start to perform so badly as to
		be unusable. However, since hundreds of attendees would exceed the
		physical capacity of the conference site, we knew the number of
		registrations would have been limited long before the performance of
		this script became a significant problem. So while this approach is,
		in general, a lousy way to address this problem, it is perfectly
		satisfactory within the confines of the particular purpose for which
		the script has ever actually been used. Such practical constraints are
		typical of <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode">THROWAWAY CODE</a>, and
		are more often than not undocumented. For that matter, everything
		about <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode">THROWAWAY CODE</a> is more
		often than not undocumented. When documentation exists, it is
		frequently not current, and often not accurate.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Wiki-Web <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MoreAboutMechanics">code</a>
		at <a href="http://www.c2.com/">www.c2.com</a> also started as a CGI
		experiment undertaken by Ward Cunningham also succeeded beyond the
		author’s expectations. The name "wiki" is one of
		Ward’s personal jokes, having been taken from a Hawaiian word for
		"quick" that the author had seen on an airport van on a
		vacation in Hawaii. Ward has subsequently used the name for a number
		of quick-and-dirty projects. The Wiki Web is unusual in that <u>any</u>
		visitor may change anything that anyone else has written
		indiscriminately. This would seem like a recipe for vandalism, but in
		practice, it has worked out well. In light of the system’s
		success, the author has subsequently undertaken additional work to
		polish it up, but the same quick-and-dirty Perl CGI core remains at
		the heart of the system.
	</p>

	<p>
		Both systems might be thought of as being on the verge of graduating
		from little balls of mud to <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALLS OF MUD</a>. The registration system’s C code <i><a href="http://laputan.org/dfc/discussion.html#Skeletons">metastasized</a></i> from one of
		the NCSA HTTPD server demos, and still contains zombie code that
		testifies to this heritage. At each step, <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#KeepItWorking">KEEPING IT WORKING</a> is a premiere
		consideration in deciding whether to extend or enhance the system.
		Both systems might be good candidates for <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#Reconstruction">RECONSTRUCTION</a>, were the
		resources, interest, and audience present to justify such an
		undertaking. In the mean time, these systems, which are still
		sufficiently well suited to the particular tasks for which they were
		built, remain in service. Keeping them on the air takes far less
		energy than rewriting them. They continue to evolve, in a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL</a> fashion, a little at a
		time.
	</p>

	<p>You can ameloriate the architectural erosion that can be caused
		by quick-and-dirty code by isolating it from other parts of your
		system, in its own objects, packages, or modules. To the extent that
		such code can be quarantined, its ability to affect the integrity of
		healthy parts of a system is reduced.</p>

	<p>
		Once it becomes evident that a purportedly disposable artifact is
		going to be around for a while, one can turn one's attention to
		improving its structure, either through an iterative process of <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL GROWTH</a>, or via a fresh
		draft, as discussed in the <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#Reconstruction">RECONSTRUCTION</a>
		pattern.

		Urban planning has an <a href="http://www.architectureweek.com/2001/0822/culture_1-2.html">uneven</a>
		history of success. For instance, Washington D.C. was laid out

		designed by the French architect <a href="http://www.nps.gov/nama/lenfant.htm">L’Enfant</a>. The
		capitals of
		<!-- Was: http://www1.estado.com.br/english/brasil/brasili2.html -->
		Brazil (<a href="http://www.macalstr.edu/~geograph/world-urbanization/jmoersch/geography.html">Brasilia</a>)
		and Nigeria (<a href="http://cityguide.lycos.com/africa/westcentral_africa/NGAAbuja.html">Abuja</a>)
		started as paper cities as well. Other cities, such as <a href="http://www.patternlanguage.com/leveltwo/archivesframe.htm?/leveltwo/../archives/alexander1.htm">Houston</a>,
		have grown without any overarching plan to guide them. Each approach
		has its problems. For instance, the radial street plans in
		L’Enftant’s master plan become awkward past a certain
		distance from the center. The lack of any plan at all, on the other
		hand, leads to a patchwork of residential, commercial, and industrial
		areas that is dictated by the capricious interaction of local forces
		such as land ownership, capital, and zoning. Since concerns such as
		recreation, shopping close to homes, and noise and pollution away from
		homes are not brought directly into the mix, they are not adequately
		addressed.
	</p>

	<p>Most cities are more like Houston than Abuja. They may begin as
		settlements, subdivisions, docks, or railway stops. Maybe people were
		drawn by gold, or lumber, access to transportation, or empty land. As
		time goes on, certain settlements achieve a critical mass, and a
		positive feedback cycle ensues. The city’s success draws
		tradesmen, merchants, doctors, and clergymen. The growing population
		is able to support infrastructure, governmental institutions, and
		police protection. These, in turn, draw more people. Different
		sections of town develop distinct identities. With few exceptions,
		(Salt Lake City comes to mind) the founders of these settlements never
		stopped to think that they were founding major cities. Their ambitions
		were usually more modest, and immediate.</p>

	<p>It has become fashionable over the last several years to take
		pot shots at the "traditional" waterfall process model. It may seem to
		the reader that attacking it is tantamount to flogging a dead horse.
		However, if it be a dead horse, it is a tenacious one. While the
		approach itself is seen by many as having been long since discredited,
		it has spawned a legacy of rigid, top-down, front-loaded processes and
		methodologies that endure, in various guises, to this day. We can do
		worse that examine the forces that led to its original development.</p>

	<p>
		In the days before waterfall development, programming pioneers
		employed a simple, casual, relatively undisciplined "code-and-fix"
		approach to software development. Given the primitive nature of the
		problems of the day, this approach was frequently effective. However,
		the result of this lack of discipline was, all too often, a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a>.
	</p>

	<p>The waterfall approach arose in response to this muddy morass.
		While the code-and-fix approach might have been suitable for small
		jobs, it did not scale well. As software became more complex, it would
		not do to simply gather a room full of programmers together and tell
		them to go forth and code. Larger projects demanded better planning
		and coordination. Why, it was asked, can't software be engineered like
		cars and bridges, with a careful analysis of the problem, and a
		detailed up-front design prior to implementation? Indeed, an
		examination of software development costs showed that problems were
		many times more expensive to fix during maintenance than during
		design. Surely it was best to mobilize resources and talent up-front,
		so as to avoid maintenance expenses down the road. It's surely wiser
		to route the plumbing correctly now, before the walls are up, than to
		tear holes in them later. Measure twice, cut once.</p>

	<p>One of the reasons that the waterfall approach was able to
		flourish a generation ago was that computers and business requirements
		changed at a more leisurely pace. Hardware was very expensive, often
		dwarfing the salaries of the programmers hired to tend it. User
		interfaces were primitive by today's standards. You could have any
		user interface you wanted, as long as it was an alphanumeric "green
		screen". Another reason for the popularity of the waterfall approach
		was that it exhibited a comfortable similarity to practices in more
		mature engineering and manufacturing disciplines.</p>

	<p>Today's designers are confronted with a broad onslaught of
		changing requirements. It arises in part from the rapid growth of
		technology itself, and partially from rapid changes in the business
		climate (some of which is driven by technology). Customers are used to
		more sophisticated software these days, and demand more choice and
		flexibility. Products that were once built from the ground up by
		in-house programmers must now be integrated with third-party code and
		applications. User interfaces are complex, both externally and
		internally. Indeed, we often dedicate an entire tier of our system to
		their care and feeding. Change threatens to outpace our ability to
		cope with it.</p>

	<p><span><b>Master plans are often
						rigid, misguided and out of date. Users’ needs change with
						time.</b></span></p>

	<p>
		<i>Change:</i> The fundamental problem with top-down design is that
		real world requirement are inevitably moving targets. You can't simply
		aspire to solve the problem at hand once and for all, because, by the
		time you're done, the problem will have changed out from underneath
		you. You can't simply do what the customer wants, for quite often,
		they don't know what they want. You can't simply plan, you have to
		plan to be able to adapt. If you can't fully anticipate what is going
		to happen, you must be prepared to be nimble.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Aesthetics:</i> The goal of up-front design is to be able to
		discern and specify the significant architectural elements of a system
		before ground is broken for it. A superior design, given this mindset,
		is one that elegantly and completely specifies the system's structure
		before a single line of code has been written. Mismatches between
		these blueprints and reality are considered aberrations, and are
		treated as mistakes on the part of the designer. A better design would
		have anticipated these oversights. In the presence of volatile
		requirements, aspirations towards such design perfection are as vain
		as the desire for a hole-in-one on every hole.
	</p>

	<p>To avoid such embarrassment, the designer may attempt to cover
		him or herself by specifying a more complicated, and more general
		solution to certain problems, secure in the knowledge that others will
		bear the burden of constructing these artifacts. When such predictions
		about where complexity is needed are correct, they can indeed be a
		source of power and satisfaction. This is part of their allure of
		Venustas. However, sometime the anticipated contingencies never arise,
		and the designer and implementers wind up having wasted effort solving
		a problem that no one has ever actually had. Other times, not only is
		the anticipated problem never encountered, its solution introduces
		complexity in a part of the system that turns out to need to evolve in
		another direction. In such cases, speculative complexity can be an
		unnecessary obstacle to subsequent adaptation. It is ironic that the
		impulse towards elegance can be an unintended source of complexity and
		clutter instead.</p>

	<p>In its most virulent form, the desire to anticipate and head off
		change can lead to "analysis paralysis", as the thickening web of
		imagined contingencies grows to the point where the design space seems
		irreconcilably constrained.</p>

	<p><b><u><i>Therefore</i></u>, incrementally
					address forces that encourage change and growth. Allow
					opportunities for growth to be exploited <u>locally</u>, as they
					occur. Refactor unrelentingly.</b></p>

	<p>
		Successful software attracts a wider audience, which can, in turn,
		place a broader range of requirements on it. These new requirements
		can run against the grain of the original design. Nonetheless, they
		can frequently be addressed, but at the cost of cutting across the
		grain of existing architectural assumptions. [Foote 1988] called this
		architectural erosion <i><a href="http://laputan.org/dfc/discussion.html#Specificity">midlife generality loss</a></i>.
	</p>

	<p>
		When designers are faced with a choice between building something
		elegant from the ground up, or undermining the architecture of the
		existing system to quickly address a problem, architecture usually
		loses. Indeed, this is a natural phase in a system’s evolution [<a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html">Foote &amp; Opdyke 1995</a>]. This
		might be thought of as <i>messy kitchen</i> phase, during which pieces
		of the system are scattered across the counter, awaiting an eventual
		cleanup. The danger is that the clean up is never done. With real
		kitchens, the board of health will eventually intervene. With
		software, alas, there is seldom any corresponding agency to police
		such squalor. Uncontrolled growth can ultimately be a malignant force.
		The result of neglecting to contain it can be a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		In <i>How Buildings Learn</i>, Brand [Brand 1994] observed that what
		he called <i>High Road</i> architecture often resulted in buildings
		that were expensive and difficult to change, while vernacular, <i>Low
			Road</i> buildings like bungalows and warehouses were, paradoxically,
		much more adaptable. Brand noted that <i>Function melts form</i>, and
		low road buildings are more amenable to such change. Similarly, with
		software, you may be reluctant to desecrate another programmer’s
		cathedral. Expedient changes to a low road system that exhibits no
		discernable architectural pretensions to begin with are easier to
		rationalize.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the Oregon Experiment [Brand 1994][Alexander 1988] <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/ca/ca/ca.html">Alexander</a> noted:
	</p>
	<dir>
		<i> Large-lump development is based on the idea of <b>replacement</b>.
			Piecemeal Growth is based on the idea of <b>repair</b>. …
			Large-lump development is based on the fallacy that it is possible to
			build perfect buildings. Piecemeal growth is based on the healthier
			and more realistic view that mistakes are inevitable. … Unless
			money is available for repairing these mistakes, every building, once
			built, is condemned to be, to some extent unworkable. …
			Piecemeal growth is based on the assumption that adaptation between
			buildings and their users is necessarily a slow and continuous
			business which cannot, under any circumstances, be achieve in a
			single leap.
		</i>
	</dir>

	<p>Alexander has noted that our mortgage and capital expenditure
		policies make large sums of money available up front, but do nothing
		to provide resources for maintenance, improvement, and evolution
		[Brand 1994][Alexander 1988]. In the software world, we deploy our
		most skilled, experienced people early in the lifecycle. Later on,
		maintenance is relegated to junior staff, when resources can be
		scarce. The so-called maintenance phase is the part of the lifecycle
		in which the price of the fiction of master planning is really paid.
		It is maintenance programmers who are called upon to bear the burden
		of coping with the ever widening divergence between fixed designs and
		a continuously changing world. If the hypothesis that architectural
		insight emerges late in the lifecycle is correct, then this practice
		should be reconsidered.</p>

	<p>
		Brand went on to observe <i>Maintenance <b>is</b> learning.
		</i>He distinguishes three levels of learning in the context of systems.
		This first is habit, where a system dutifully serves its function
		within the parameters for which it was designed. The second level
		comes into play when the system must adapt to change. Here, it usually
		must be modified, and its capacity to sustain such modification
		determines it’s degree of adaptability. The third level is the
		most interesting: <i>learning to learn</i>. With buildings, adding a
		raised floor is an example. Having had to sustain a major upheaval,
		the system adapts so that subsequent adaptations will be much less
		painful.
	</p>

	<p>
		<a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL GROWTH</a> can be
		undertaken in an opportunistic fashion, starting with the existing,
		living, breathing system, and working outward, a step at a time, in
		such a way as to not undermine the system’s viability. You
		enhance the program as you use it. Broad advances on all fronts are
		avoided. Instead, change is broken down into small, manageable chunks.
	</p>

	<p>
		One of the most striking things about <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL GROWTH</a> is the role
		played by <i>Feedback</i>. Herbert Simon [Simon 1969] has observed
		that few of the adaptive systems that have been forged by evolution or
		shaped by man depend on prediction as their main means of coping with
		the future. He notes that two complementary mechanisms, homeostasis,
		and retrospective feedback, are often far more effective. Homeostasis
		insulates the system from short-range fluctuations in its environment,
		while feedback mechanisms respond to long-term discrepancies between a
		system's actual and desired behavior, and adjust it accordingly.
		Alexander [Alexander 1964] has written extensively of the roles that
		homeostasis and feedback play in adaptation as well.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you can adapt quickly to change, predicting it becomes far less
		crucial. Hindsight, as Brand observes [Brand 1994] is better than
		foresight. Such rapid adaptation is the basis of one of the mantras of
		<a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/">Extreme Programming</a> [Beck
		2000]: <i>You're not going to need it</i>.
	</p>

	<p>Proponents of XP (as it is called) say to pretend you are not a
		smart as you think you are, and wait until this clever idea of yours
		is actually required before you take the time to bring it into being.
		In the cases where you were right, hey, you saw it coming, and you
		know what to do. In the cases where you were wrong, you won't have
		wasted any effort solving a problem you've never had when the design
		heads in an unanticipated direction instead.</p>

	<p>
		<a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/">Extreme Programming</a> relies
		heavily on feedback to keep requirements in sync with code, by
		emphasizing short (three week) iterations, and extensive, continuous
		consultation with users regarding design and development priorities
		throughout the development process. Extreme Programmers do not engage
		in extensive up-front planning. Instead, they produce working code as
		quickly as possible, and steer these prototypes towards what the users
		are looking for based on feedback.
	</p>

	<p>Feedback also plays a role in determining coding assignments.
		Coders who miss a deadline are assigned a different task during the
		next iteration, regardless of how close they may have been to
		completing the task. This form of feedback resembles the stern justice
		meted out by the jungle to the fruit of uncompetitive pairings.</p>

	<p>
		<a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/">Extreme Programming</a> also
		emphasizes testing as an integral part of the development process.
		Tests are developed, ideally, before the code itself. Code is
		continuously tested as it is developed.
	</p>

	<p>
		There is a "back-to-the-future" quality to Extreme Programming. In
		many respects, it resembles the blind <i>Code and Fix</i> approach.
		The thing that distinguishes it is the central role played by feedback
		in driving the system's evolution. This evolution is abetted, in turn,
		by modern object-oriented languages and powerful refactoring tools.
	</p>

	<p>Proponents of extreme programming portray it as placing minimal
		emphasis on planning and up-front design. They rely instead on
		feedback and continuous integration. We believe that a certain amount
		of up-front planning and design is not only important, but inevitable.
		No one really goes into any project blindly. The groundwork must be
		laid, the infrastructure must be decided upon, tools must be selected,
		and a general direction must be set. A focus on a shared architectural
		vision and strategy should be established early.</p>

	<p>Unbridled, change can undermine structure. Orderly change can
		enhance it. Change can engender malignant sprawl, or healthy, orderly
		growth.</p>

		A broad consensus that objects emerge from an <i>iterative
			incremental</i> evolutionary process has formed in the object-oriented
		community over the last decade. See for instance [Booch 1994]. The <a href="http://laputan.org/metamorphosis/metamorphosis.html#SoftwareTectonics">SOFTWARE
			TECTONICS</a> pattern [Foote &amp; Yoder 1996] examines how systems can
		incrementally cope with change.
	</p>

	<p>
		The biggest risk associated with <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL
			GROWTH</a> is that it will gradually erode the overall structure of the
		system, and inexorably turn it into a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a>. A strategy of <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#KeepItWorking">KEEPING
			IT WORKING</a> goes hand in hand with <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL
			GROWTH</a>. Both patterns emphasize acute, local concerns at the expense
		of chronic, architectural ones.
	</p>

	<p>
		To counteract these forces, a permanent commitment to <a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Consolidate">CONSOLIDATION</a> and
		<a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Table2">refactoring</a> must be
		made. It is through such a process that local and global forces are
		reconciled over time. This lifecyle perspective has been dubbed the <i><a href="http://laputan.org/frameworks/fractal.html">fractal model</a></i> [<a href="http://laputan.org/lifecycle/lifecycle.html">Foote &amp; Opdyke 1995</a>]. To

		<i>An organic process of growth and repair must create a gradual
			sequence of changes, and these changes must be distributed evenly
			across all levels of scale. [In developing a college campus] there
			must be as much attention to the repair of details—rooms, wings

			buildings. Only then can the environment be balanced both as a whole,

	<p>Once a city establishes its infrastructure, it is imperative
		that it be kept working. For example, if the sewers break, and
		aren’t quickly repaired, the consequences can escalate from
		merely unpleasant to genuinely life threatening. People come to expect
		that they can rely on their public utilities being available 24 hours
		per day. They (rightfully) expect to be able to demand that an outage
		be treated as an emergency.</p>

	<p>
		<span face="Wingdings">v</span><span> </span><span face="Wingdings">v</span><span>

	</p>
	<p>Software can be like this. Often a business becomes dependent
		upon the data driving it. Businesses have become critically dependent
		on their software and computing infrastructures. There are numerous
		mission critical systems that must be on-the-air twenty-four hours a
		day/seven days per week. If these systems go down, inventories can not
		be checked, employees can not be paid, aircraft cannot be routed, and
		so on.</p>

	<p>
		There may be times where taking a system down for a major overhaul can
		be justified, but usually, doing so is fraught with peril. However,
		once the system is brought back up, it is difficult to tell which from
		among a large collection of modifications might have caused a new
		problem. Every change is suspect. This is why deferring such
		integration is a recipe for misery. Capers Jones [Jones 1999] reported
		that the chance that a significant change might contain a new error--a
		phenomenon he ominously referred to as a <i>Bad Fix Injection</i>--
		was about 7% in the United States. This may strike some readers as a
		low figure. Still, it's easy to see that compounding this possibility
		can lead to a situation where multiple upgrades are increasing likely
		to break a system.
	</p>

	<p><b>Maintenance needs have accumulated, but
					an overhaul is unwise, since you might break the system.</b></p>


	<p>
		<i>Workmanship:</i> Architects who live in the house they are building
		have an obvious incentive to insure that things are done properly,
		since they will directly reap the consequences when they do not. The
		idea of the architect-builder is a central theme of Alexander's work.
		Who better to resolve the forces impinging upon each design issue as
		it arises as the person who is going to have to live with these
		decisions? The architect-builder will be the direct beneficiary of his
		or her own workmanship and care. Mistakes and shortcuts will merely
		foul his or her own nest.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Dependability:</i> These days, people rely on our software
		artifacts for their very livelihoods, and even, at time, for their
		very safety. It is imperative that ill-advise changes to elements of a
		system do not drag the entire system down. Modern software systems are
		intricate, elaborate webs of interdependent elements. When an
		essential element is broken, everyone who depends on it will be
		affected. Deadlines can be missed, and tempers can flare. This problem
		is particularly acute in <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALLS
			OF MUD</a>, since a single failure can bring the entire system down like
		a house of cards.
	</p>

	<p><b><u><i>Therefore</i></u>, do what it
					takes to maintain the software and keep it going. Keep it working.</b></p>

	<p>When you are living in the system you�re building, you have an
		acute incentive not to break anything. A plumbing outage will be a
		direct inconvenience, and hence you have a powerful reason to keep it
		brief. You are, at times, working with live wires, and must exhibit
		particular care. A major benefit of working with a live system is that
		feedback is direct, and nearly immediate.</p>

	<p>
		One of the strengths of this strategy is that modifications that break
		the system are rejected immediately. There are always a large number
		of paths forward from any point in a system’s evolution, and most
		of them lead nowhere. By immediately selecting only those that do <u>not</u>
		undermine the system’s viability, obvious dead-ends are avoided.
	</p>

	<p>
		Of course, this sort of reactive approach, that of kicking the
		nearest, meanest woolf from your door, is not necessarily globally
		optimal. Yet, by eliminating obvious wrong turns, <u>only</u> more
		insidiously incorrect paths remain. While these are always harder to
		identify and correct, they are, fortunately less numerous than those
		cases where the best immediate choice is also the best overall choice
		as well.
	</p>

	<p>It may seem that this approach only accommodates minor
		modifications. This is not necessarily so. Large new subsystems might
		be constructed off to the side, perhaps by separate teams, and
		integrated with the running system in such a way as to minimize
		distruption.</p>

	<p>Design space might be thought of as a vast, dark, largely
		unexplored forest. Useful potential paths through it might be thought
		of as encompassing working programs. The space off to the sides of
		these paths is much larger realm of non-working programs. From any
		given point, a few small steps in most directions take you from a
		working to a non-working program. From time to time, there are forks
		in the path, indicating a choice among working alternatives. In
		unexplored territory, the prudent strategy is never to stray too far
		from the path. Now, if one has a map, a shortcut through the trekless
		thicket that might save miles may be evident. Of course, pioneers, by
		definition, don’t have maps. By taking small steps in any
		direction, they know that it is never more than a few steps back to a
		working system.</p>

		<span face="Courier New" size="2">Some years ago, Harlan Mills
			proposed that any software system should be grown by incremental

	</p>
	<p>
		The notion of <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#ShearingLayers">SHEARING LAYERS</a> is
		one of the centerpieces of Brand's <i>How Buildings Learn</i> [Brand
		1994]. Brand, in turn synthesized his ideas from a variety of sources,
		including British designer Frank Duffy, and ecologist R. V. O'Neill.
	</p>
	<a href="http://laputan.org/images/figures/shearing-layers.gif"> <img src="http://laputan.org/images/figures/shearing-small.gif" alt="Brand, Page 13">
	</a>

	<p>Brand quotes Duffy as saying: "Our basic argument is that there
		isn't any such thing as a building. A building properly conceived is
		several layers of longevity of built components".</p>

	<p>Brand distilled Duffy's proposed layers into these six: Site,
		Structure, Skin, Services, Space Plan, and Stuff. Site is geographical
		setting. Structure is the load bearing elements, such as the
		foundation and skeleton. Skin is the exterior surface, such as siding
		and windows. Services are the circulatory and nervous systems of a
		building, such as its heating plant, wiring, and plumbing. The Space
		Plan includes walls, flooring, and ceilings. Stuff includes lamps,
		chairs, appliances, bulletin boards, and paintings.</p>

	<p>These layers change at different rates. Site, they say, is
		eternal. Structure may last from 30 to 300 years. Skin lasts for
		around 20 years, as it responds to the elements, and to the whims of
		fashion. Services succumb to wear and technical obsolescence more
		quickly, in 7 to 15 years. Commercial Space Plans may turn over every
		3 years. Stuff, is, of course, subject to unrelenting flux [Brand
		1994].</p>

		Software systems cannot stand still. Software is often called upon to
		bear the brunt of changing requirements, because, being as that it is
		made of bits, it <u>can</u> change.
	</p>

	<p><span><b>Different artifacts change
						at different rates.</b></span></p>

	<p>
		<i>Adaptability:</i> A system that can cope readily with a wide range
		of requirements, will, all other things being equal, have an advantage
		over one that cannot. Such a system can allow unexpected requirements
		to be met with little or no reengineering, and allow its more skilled
		customers to rapidly address novel challenges.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Stability:</i> Systems succeed by doing what they were designed to
		do as well as they can do it. They earn their niches, by bettering
		their competition along one or more dimensions such as cost, quality,
		features, and performance. See [<a href="http://laputan.org/lingua/lingua.html">Foote
			&amp; Roberts 1998</a>] for a discussion of the occasionally fickle nature of
		such completion. Once they have found their niche, for whatever
		reason, it is essential that short term concerns not be allowed to
		wash away the elements of the system that account for their mastery of
		their niche. Such victories are inevitably hard won, and fruits of
		such victories should not be squandered. Those parts of the system
		that do what the system does well must be protected from fads, whims,
		and other such spasms of poor judgement.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Adaptability</i> and <i>Stability</i> are forces that are in
		constant tension. On one hand, systems must be able to confront
		novelty without blinking. On the other, they should not squander their
		patrimony on spur of the moment misadventures.
	</p>

	<p><b><u><i>Therefore</i></u>, factor your
					system so that artifacts that change at similar rates are together.</b></p>

	<p>
		Most interactions in a system tend to be within layers, or between
		adjacent layers. Individual layers tend to be about things that change
		at similar rates. Things that change at different rates diverge.
		Differential rates of change encourage layers to emerge. Brand notes
		as well that occupational specialties emerge along with these layers.
		The rate at which things change shapes our organizations as well. For
		instance, decorators and painters concern themselves with interiors,
		while architects dwell on site and skin. We expect to see things that
		evolve at different rates emerge as distinct concerns. This is <a href="http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/~droberts/evolve.html#SeparateChangeable">"separate
			that which changes from that which doesn't"</a> [<a href="http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/~droberts/evolve.html">Roberts
			&amp; Johnson 1998</a>] writ large.
	</p>

	<p>Can we identify such layers in software?</p>

	<p>Well, at the bottom, there are data. Things that change most
		quickly migrate into the data, since this is the aspect of software
		that is most amenable to change. Data, in turn, interact with users
		themselves, who produce and consume them.</p>

	<p>Code changes more slowly than data, and is the realm of
		programmers, analysts and designers. In object-oriented languages,
		things that will change quickly are cast as black-box polymorphic
		components. Elements that will change less often may employ white-box
		inheritance.</p>

	<p>The abstract classes and components that constitute an
		object-oriented framework change more slowly than the applications
		that are built from them. Indeed, their role is to distill what is
		common, and enduring, from among the applications that seeded the
		framework.</p>

	<p>
		As frameworks evolve, certain abstractions make their ways from
		individual applications into the frameworks and libraries that
		constitute the system's infrastructure [<a href="http://laputan.org/dfc/discussion.html">Foote 1988</a>]. Not all elements will
		make this journey. Not all should. Those that do are among the most
		valuable legacies of the projects that spawn them. Objects help
		shearing layers to emerge, because they provide places where more
		fine-grained chunks of code and behavior that belong together can
		coalesce.
	</p>

	<p>The Smalltalk programming language is built from a set of
		objects that have proven themselves to be of particular value to
		programmers. Languages change more slowly than frameworks. They are
		the purview of scholars and standards committees. One of the
		traditional functions of such bodies is to ensure that languages
		evolve at a suitably deliberate pace.</p>

	<p>Artifacts that evolve quickly provide a system with dynamism and
		flexibility. They allow a system to be fast on its feet in the face of
		change.</p>

	<p>Slowly evolving objects are bulwarks against change. They embody
		the wisdom that the system has accrued in its prior interactions with
		its environment. Like tenure, tradition, big corporations, and
		conservative politics, they maintain what has worked. They worked
		once, so they are kept around. They had a good idea once, so maybe
		they are a better than even bet to have another one.</p>

	<p>Wide acceptance and deployment causes resistance to change. If
		changing something will break a lot of code, there is considerable
		incentive not to change it. For example, schema reorganization in
		large enterprise databases can be an expensive and time-consuming
		process. Database designers and administrators learn to resist change
		for this reason. Separate job descriptions, and separate hardware,
		together with distinct tiers, help to make these tiers distinct.</p>

	<p>The phenomenon whereby distinct concerns emerge as distinct
		layers and tiers can be seen as well with graphical user interfaces.</p>

	<p>
		Part of the impetus behind using <a href="http://laputan.org/metadata/metadata.html#Metadata">METADATA</a> [<a href="http://laputan.org/metadata/metadata.html">Foote &amp; Yoder 1998b</a>] is the
		observation that pushing complexity and power into the data pushes
		that same power (and complexity) out of the realm of the programmer
		and into the realm of users themselves. Metadata are often used to
		model static facilities such as classes and schemas, in order to allow
		them to change dynamically. The effect is analogous to that seen with
		modular office furniture, which allows office workers to easily,
		quickly, and cheaply move partitions without having to enlist
		architects and contractors in the effort.
	</p>

	<p>Over time, our frameworks, abstract classes, and components come
		to embody what we've learned about the structure of the domains for
		which they are built. More enduring insights gravitate towards the
		primary structural elements of these systems. Things which find
		themselves in flux are spun out into the data, where users can
		interact with them. Software evolution becomes like a centrifuge spun
		by change. The layers that result, over time, can come to a much truer
		accommodation with the forces that shaped them than any top-down
		agenda could have devised.</p>

	<p>
		<span face="Courier New" size="2">Things that are good have a
			certain kind of structure. You can�t get that structure except
			dynamically. Period. In nature you�ve got continuous
			very-small-feedback-loop adaptation going on, which is why things get

		If you don’t come up with an easy to understand interface,

	<p>To begin to get a handle on spaghetti code, find those sections

		well-defined interfaces. Such steps can be the first ones on the road

	<p>
		Putting a fresh interface around a run down region of the system can
		be the first step on the way architectural rehabilitation. This is a

	<p>Atlanta’s Fulton County Stadium was built in 1966 to serve
		as the home of baseball’s Atlanta Braves, and football’s
		Atlanta Falcons. In August of 1997, the stadium was demolished. Two
		factors contributed to its relatively rapid obsolescence. One was that
		the architecture of the original stadium was incapable of
		accommodating the addition of the "sky-box" suites that the
		spreadsheets of ‘90s sporting economics demanded. No conceivable
		retrofit could accommodate this requirement. Addressing it meant
		starting over, from the ground up. The second was that the
		stadium’s attempt to provide a cheap, general solution to the
		problem of providing a forum for both baseball and football audiences
		compromised the needs of both. In only thirty-one years, the balance
		among these forces had shifted decidedly. The facility is being
		replaced by two new single-purpose stadia.</p>

	<p>Might there be lessons for us about unexpected requirements and

				(You Will Anyway)</i> -- Brooks
		</span>
	</p>

	<p>Extreme Programming [Beck 2000] had its genesis in the Chrysler
		Comprehensive Compensation project (C3). It began with a cry for help
		from a foundering project, and a decision to discard a year and a
		half's worth of work. The process they put in place after they started
		anew laid the foundation for XP, and the author's credit these
		approaches for the subsequent success of the C3 effort. However, less
		emphasis is given to value of the experience the team might have
		salvaged from their initial, unsuccessful draft. Could this first
		draft have been the unsung hero of this tale?</p>

	<p><span><b>Your code has declined to
						the point where it is beyond repair, or even comprehension.</b></span></p>


	<p>
		<i>Obsolescence</i>: Of course, one reason to abandon a system is that
		it is in fact technically or economically obsolete. These are distinct
		situations. A system that is no longer state-of-the-art may still sell
		well, while a technically superior system may be overwhelmed by a more
		popular competitor for non-technical reasons.
	</p>

	<p>In the realm of concrete and steel, blight is the symptom, and a
		withdrawal of capital is the cause. Of course, once this process
		begins, it can feed on itself. On the other hand, given a steady
		infusion of resources, buildings can last indefinitely. It's not
		merely entropy, but an unwillingness to counteract it, that allows
		buildings to decline. In Europe, neighborhoods have flourished for
		hundreds of years. They have avoided the boom/bust cycles that
		characterize some New World cities.</p>

	<p>
		<i>Change:</i> Even though software is a highly malleable medium, like
		Fulton County Stadium, new demands can, at times, cut across a
		system’s architectural assumptions in such a ways as to make
		accommodating them next to impossible. In such cases, a total rewrite
		might be the only answer.
	</p>


	<p>
		<i>Cost</i>: Writing-off a system can be traumatic, both to those who
		have worked on it, and to those who have paid for it. Software is
		often treated as an asset by accountants, and can be an expensive
		asset at that. Rewriting a system, of course, does not discard its
		conceptual design, or its staff’s experience. If it is truly the
		case that the value of these assets is in the design experience they
		embody, then accounting practices must recognize this.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Organization:</i> Rebuilding a system from scratch is a
		high-profile undertaking, that will demand considerable time and
		resources, which, in turn, will make high-level management support
		essential.
	</p>

	<p><b><u><i>Therefore</i></u>, throw it away
					and start over.</b></p>

	<p>Sometimes it’s just easier to throw a system away, and
		start over. Examples abound. Our shelves are littered with the
		discarded carcasses of obsolete software and its documentation.
		Starting over can be seen as a defeat at the hands of the old code, or
		a victory over it.</p>
	<a href="http://www.sheridanc.on.ca/~randy/design.dir/disaster.dir/disaster.htm">
		<img src="http://laputan.org/images/pictures/pruitt3.jpg" alt="Pruitt-Igoe">
	</a>

	<p>One reason to start over might be that the previous system was
		written by people who are long gone. Doing a rewrite provides new
		personnel with a way to reestablish contact between the architecture
		and the implementation. Sometimes the only way to understand a system
		it is to write it yourself. Doing a fresh draft is a way to overcome
		neglect. Issues are revisited. A fresh draft adds vigor. You draw back
		to leap. The quagmire vanishes. The swamp is drained.</p>

	<p>Another motivation for building a new system might be that you
		feel that you've got the experience you need to do the job properly.
		One way to have gotten this experience is to have participated at some
		level in the unsuccessful development of a previous version of the
		system.</p>

	<p>Of course, the new system is not designed in a vacuum.
		Brook’s famous tar pit is excavated, and the fossils are
		examined, to see what they can tell the living. It is essential that a
		thorough post-mortem review be done of the old system, to see what it
		did well, and why it failed. Bad code can bog down a good design. A
		good design can isolate and contain bad code.</p>

	<p>
		When a system becomes a <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL
			OF MUD</a>, its relative incomprehensibility may hasten its demise, by
		making it difficult for it to adapt. It can persist, since it resists
		change, but cannot evolve, for the same reason. Instead, its
		inscrutability, even when it is to its s hort-term benefit, sows the
		seeds of its ultimate demise.
	</p>

	<p>If this makes muddiness a frequently terminal condition, is this
		really a bad thing? Or is it a blessing that these sclerotic systems
		yield the stage to more agile successors? Certainly, the departure of
		these ramshackle relics can be a cause for celebration as well as
		sadness.</p>
	<a href="http://www.webslingerz.com/~jhoffman/chcat.html"> <img src="http://laputan.org/images/pictures/chcat1.gif" alt="Cheshire Cat">
	</a>
	<p>Discarding a system dispenses with its implementation, and
		leaves only its conceptual design behind. Only the patterns that
		underlie the system remain, grinning like a Cheshire cat. It is their
		spirits that help to shape the next implementation. With luck, these
		architectural insights will be reincarnated as genuine reusable
		artifacts in the new system, such as abstract classes and frameworks.
		It is by finding these architectural nuggets that the promise of
		objects and reuse can finally be fulfilled.</p>

	<p>
		There are alternatives to throwning your system away and starting
		over. One is to embark on a regimen of incremental refactoring, to
		glean architectural elements and discernable abstractions from the
		mire. Indeed, you can begin by looking for coarse fissures along which
		to separate parts of the system, as was suggested in <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#SweepingItUnderTheRug">SWEEPING IT UNDER THE RUG</a>.
		Of course, refactoring is more effective as a prophylactic measure
		that as a last-restort therapy. As with any edifice, it is a judgement
		call, whether to rehab or restort for the wrecking ball. Another
		alternative is to reassess whether new components and frameworks have
		come along that can replace all or part of the system. When you can
		reuse and retrofit other existing components, you can spare yourself
		the time and expense involved in rebuilding, repairing, and
		maintaining the one you have.

		In the end, software architecture is about how we distill experience
		into wisdom, and disseminate it. We think the patterns herein stand
		alongside other work regarding software architecture and evolution
		that we cited as we went along. Still, we do not consider these
		patterns to be anti-patterns. There are good reasons that good
		programmers build <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALLS OF MUD</a>.
		It may well be that the economics of the software world are such that
		the market moves so fast that long term architectural ambitions are
		foolhardy, and that expedient, slash-and-burn, disposable programming
		is, in fact, a state-of-the-art strategy. The success of these
		approaches, in any case, is undeniable, and seals their pattern-hood.
		People build
	</p><p>
		<a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALLS OF MUD</a> because they <u>work</u>.
		In many domains, they are the only things that have been shown to
		work. Indeed, they work where loftier approaches have yet to
		demonstrate that they can compete.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is not our purpose to condemn <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALLS OF MUD</a>. Casual architecture is natural during the early stages
		of a system’s evolution. The reader must surely suspect, however,
		that our hope is that we can aspire to do better. By recognizing the
		forces and pressures that lead to architectural malaise, and how and
		when they might be confronted, we hope to set the stage for the
		emergence of truly durable artifacts that can put architects in
		dominant positions for years to come. The key is to ensure that the
		system, its programmers, and, indeed the entire organization, <i>learn</i>
		about the domain, and the architectural opportunities looming within
		it, as the system grows and matures.
	</p>

	<p>
		Periods of moderate disorder are a part of the ebb and flow of
		software evolution. As a master chef tolerates a messy kitchen,
		developers must not be afraid to get a little mud on their shoes as
		they explore new territory for the first time. Architectural insight
		is not the product of master plans, but of hard won experience. The
		software architects of yesteryear had little choice other than to
		apply the lessons they learned in successive drafts of their systems,
		since <a href="http://laputan.org/mud/mud.html#Reconstruction">RECONSTRUCTION</a> was often
		the only practical means they had of supplanting a mediocre system
		with a better one. Objects, frameworks, components, and refactoring
		tools provide us with another alternative. Objects present a medium
		for expressing our architectural ideas at a level between
		coarse-grained applications and components and low level code.
		Refactoring tools and techniques finally give us the means to
		cultivate these artifacts as they evolve, and capture these insights.

		better known by it's nickname, St. Basil's. Ivan too is better known
		by his nickname "Ivan the Terrible". Legend has it that once the
		cathedral was completed, Ivan, ever true to his reputation, had the
		architects blinded, so that they could never build anything more
		beautiful. Alas, the state of software architecture today is such that
		few of us need fear for our eyesight.

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said at a press conference Wednesday on Capitol Hill. "There is no reason why members of&nbsp;Congress&nbsp;ought to be profiting off of the information that only they get."</p><p>The proposal is the latest chapter in a yearslong <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-opposes-banning-stock-buys-by-congress-members.html">saga</a> in Congress to pass regulations that limit lawmakers' ability to buy and sell stocks, and the first one to get formal consideration by a Senate committee — in this case the Homeland Security &amp; Governmental Affairs&nbsp;Committee&nbsp;on July 24.</p><p>Ethics experts say that legislators' access to the kind of information they receive gives them the potential of having an unfair advantage to the investing public.</p><p>Wednesday's amendment to an existing stock trading ban bill would immediately forbid members of Congress, the president and the vice president from purchasing stocks and other covered investments. It would also give lawmakers 90 days to sell their stocks.</p><p>Sens. Hawley, Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Gary Peters, D-Mich., negotiated and announced the new details.</p><p>If passed, the bill would also prohibit lawmakers' spouses and dependent children from trading stocks, beginning March 2027. Also starting that year, the U.S. president, vice president and all members of Congress would have to divest from any covered investments.</p><p>The penalty for violating the divestment mandate, as proposed by the senators, would cost a lawmaker&nbsp;the greater amount of&nbsp;either their monthly salary, or 10% of the value of each covered asset in violation.</p><p>The effort to bar members of Congress from trading stocks has been an uphill battle since at least the start of the Biden administration.</p><p>Ossoff first introduced a ban in 2021 and put his own stock portfolio in a blind trust as an example.</p><p>The effort was turbocharged by disclosures that several senators made very profitable trades in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, when members of Congress were getting classified briefings that warned of how disastrous the virus could be for the U.S. economy. The FBI launched insider trading investigations into three senators, but eventually ended the probe without making any charges.</p><p>The effort picked up more steam ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, after former Democratic House Speaker <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-opposes-banning-stock-buys-by-congress-members.html">Nancy Pelosi</a> dropped her opposition to it.</p><p>Pelosi's husband is a multimillionaire investor Paul Pelosi, who regularly makes large and profitable stock trades. The then-speaker had previously written off the trading ban as a misguided effort to prevent lawmakers from participating in the "free market economy."</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

    </div><p>A researcher working alone—apart from the world and the rest of the wider scientific community—is a classic yet misguided image. Research is, in reality, built on continuous exchange within the scientific community: First you understand the work of others, and then you share your findings.</p>


										      
																																	<p>Reading and writing articles published in <a href="https://phys.org/tags/academic+journals/" rel="tag">academic journals</a> and presented at conferences is a central part of being a researcher. When researchers write a scholarly article, they must cite the work of peers to provide context, detail sources of inspiration and explain differences in approaches and results. A positive citation by other researchers is a key measure of visibility for a researcher's own work.</p>
<p>But what happens when this citation system is manipulated? A recent <i>Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology</i><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.24896" target="_blank">article</a> by our team of academic sleuths—which includes information scientists, a computer scientist and a mathematician—has revealed an insidious method to artificially inflate citation counts through metadata manipulations: sneaked references.</p>
<h2>Hidden manipulation</h2>
<p>People are becoming more aware of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/scientific+publications/" rel="tag">scientific publications</a> and how they work, including their potential flaws. Just last year more than <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03974-8" target="_blank">10,000 scientific articles were retracted</a>. The issues around citation gaming and the harm it causes the scientific community, including damaging its credibility, are well documented.</p>
<p>Citations of scientific work abide by a standardized referencing system: Each reference explicitly mentions at least the title, authors' names, publication year, journal or conference name, and page numbers of the cited publication. These details are stored as metadata, not visible in the article's text directly, but assigned to a digital object identifier, or DOI—a unique identifier for each scientific publication.</p>
<p>References in a scientific publication allow authors to justify methodological choices or present the results of past studies, highlighting the iterative and collaborative nature of science.</p>
<p>However, we found through a chance encounter that some unscrupulous actors have added extra references, invisible in the text but present in the articles' metadata, when they submitted the articles to scientific databases. The result? Citation counts for certain researchers or journals have skyrocketed, even though these references were not cited by the authors in their articles.</p>

																																						
																																			<h2>Chance discovery</h2>
<p>The investigation began when Guillaume Cabanac, a professor at the University of Toulouse, wrote a post on <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A172115FC8D0A5F44B31A18B08BB26" target="_blank">PubPeer</a>, a website dedicated to post-publication peer review, in which scientists discuss and analyze publications. In the post, he detailed how he had noticed an inconsistency: a Hindawi journal article that he suspected was fraudulent because it contained awkward phrases had far more citations than downloads, which is very unusual.</p>
<p>The post caught the attention of several sleuths who are now the authors of the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.24896" target="_blank">JASIST article</a>. We used a scientific search engine to look for articles citing the initial article. Google Scholar found none, but Crossref and Dimensions did find references. The difference? Google Scholar is likely to mostly rely on the article's main text to extract the references appearing in the bibliography section, whereas Crossref and Dimensions use metadata provided by publishers.</p>
<h2>A new type of fraud</h2>
<p>To understand the extent of the manipulation, we examined three scientific journals that were published by the Technoscience Academy, the publisher responsible for the articles that contained questionable citations.</p>
<p>Our investigation consisted of three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>We listed the references explicitly present in the HTML or PDF versions of an article.</li>
<li>We compared these lists with the metadata recorded by Crossref, discovering extra references added in the metadata but not appearing in the articles.</li>
<li>We checked Dimensions, a bibliometric platform that uses Crossref as a metadata source, finding further inconsistencies.</li>
</ol>

																																			<p>In the journals published by Technoscience Academy, at least 9% of recorded references were "sneaked references." These additional references were only in the metadata, distorting citation counts and giving certain authors an unfair advantage. Some legitimate references were also lost, meaning they were not present in the metadata.</p>
<p>In addition, when analyzing the sneaked references, we found that they highly benefited some researchers. For example, a single researcher who was associated with Technoscience Academy benefited from more than 3,000 additional illegitimate citations. Some journals from the same publisher benefited from a couple hundred additional sneaked citations.</p>
<p>We wanted our results to be externally validated, so we posted our study <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.02192" target="_blank">as a preprint</a>, informed both Crossref and Dimensions of our findings and gave them a link to the preprinted investigation. Dimensions acknowledged the illegitimate citations and confirmed that their database reflects Crossref's data. Crossref <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/10/09/how-thousands-of-invisible-citations-sneak-into-papers-and-make-for-fake-metrics/" target="_blank">also confirmed</a> the extra references in <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/" target="_blank">Retraction Watch</a> and highlighted that this was the first time that it had been notified of such a problem in its database. The publisher, based on Crossref's investigation, has taken action to fix the problem.</p>

																																						
																																			<h2>Implications and potential solutions</h2>
<p>Why is this discovery important? Citation counts heavily influence research funding, academic promotions and institutional rankings. Manipulating citations can lead to unjust decisions based on false data. More worryingly, this discovery raises questions about the integrity of scientific impact measurement systems, a concern that has been highlighted by researchers for years. These systems can be manipulated to foster unhealthy competition among researchers, tempting them to take shortcuts to publish faster or achieve more citations.</p>
<p>To combat this practice we suggest several measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rigorous verification of metadata by publishers and agencies like Crossref.</li>
<li>Independent audits to ensure data reliability.</li>
<li>Increased transparency in managing references and citations.</li>
</ul>
<p>This study is the first, to our knowledge, to report a manipulation of metadata. It also discusses the impact this may have on the evaluation of researchers. The study highlights, yet again, that the overreliance on metrics to evaluate researchers, their work and their impact may be inherently flawed and wrong.</p>
<p>Such overreliance is likely to promote questionable research practices, including hypothesizing after the results are known, or <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3173715" target="_blank">HARKing</a>; splitting a single set of data into several papers, known as salami slicing; data manipulation; and plagiarism. It also hinders the transparency that is key to more <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-021-01304-y" target="_blank">robust</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60329-9" target="_blank">efficient</a> research. Although the problematic <a href="https://phys.org/tags/citation/" rel="tag">citation</a><a href="https://phys.org/tags/metadata/" rel="tag">metadata</a> and sneaked references have now been apparently fixed, the corrections may have, as is <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001572" target="_blank">often the case with scientific corrections</a>, happened too late.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>If you’ve read my <a href="https://www.timdbg.com/posts/fakers-guide-to-assembly">first post about assembly language</a>, you might expect that this is another post on how to understand assembly language. I will write more about that at some point, but this post is not that. Instead, this post is going to talk about some of the weird things and random trivia I learned while writing an x86 and amd64 emulator. The emulator I wrote was for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/time-travel-debugging-overview">Time Travel Debugging</a>. One piece of TTD is a CPU emulator, which is used to record the entire execution of a process at an instruction level. The first version of TTD was called iDNA, and the emulator for iDNA was written almost completely in assembly code, which was fast but difficult to maintain and extend.</p><p>I wasn’t involved in the first version of TTD, but I was involved in the second version where we rewrote the emulation portion (and eventually most other parts). The new one was written in C++, and we aimed to achieve most of the performance of the assembly language version while having a more maintainable code base. Writing a CPU emulator is, in my opinion, the best way to <em>REALLY</em> understand how a CPU works. You need to pay attention to every detail. This post is a somewhat random collection of the things I learned. If you have a lot of experience with x86 these might be old news, but maybe a few are things you haven’t seen before.</p><h2 id="useless-x86-encoding-trivia">Useless x86 encoding trivia</h2><p>The x86 encoding scheme is a bit funny in that there are often multiple ways to encode the exact same instruction. The <code>int 3</code> instruction can be encoded as <code>CD 03</code>, but can also be encoded in a single byte of <code>CC</code>. This is a very useful encoding because <code>int 3</code> is used as a software breakpoint. That way, it’s always possible to set a breakpoint at any point in a function, even if it’s an instruction that lands at the end of a memory page (with no page mapped after it). Many of these alternate encodings are designed to be shorter for some common case. For instance, adding an immediate value to <code>EAX</code> or <code>RAX</code> with the <code>ADD</code> instruction can be expressed in a compact form that’s shorter than the more general instruction. An <code>add eax, ...</code> instruction can be encoded like this:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>05cccccccc      add     eax,0CCCCCCCCh
</code></pre><p>Doing the same for ECX takes an extra byte:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>81c1cccccccc    add     ecx,0CCCCCCCCh
</code></pre><p>So while both registers are general purpose, the fact that <code>EAX</code> is called the “Accumulator register” is not just a convention, it actually makes a difference to the encoding (and potentially the performance, as a result). Compilers tend to be very smart, and can take advantage of these shorter encodings whenever possible. Shorter instructions mean less data transferred from main memory, and more instructions that can fit in the instruction cache, which is good for performance.</p><p>There are other ways to have equivalent instructions besides just alternate encodings. Instructions in x86 can take “prefix bytes” which modify the behavior of the instruction. The “REX” set of prefixes are commonly used in 64 bit code to access a wider range of registers compared to 32-bit code (and make code sequences <a href="https://www.timdbg.com/posts/recognizing-patterns">easier to recognize</a>). An x86 CPU will happily take one of these prefixes, even if it doesn’t have any effect. Put a “REX” byte on an 8-bit add, and it does nothing:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>4004cc          add     al,0CCh
</code></pre><p>In fact, you can put TWO of these prefixes on. Many disassemblers (including the one in WinDbg) will get confused, but the CPU will execute it just fine:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>0:000&gt; rrax=0
0:000&gt; u . L2
00007ff8`22160950 40              ???
00007ff8`22160951 4004cc          add     al,0CCh
0:000&gt; t
00007ff8`22160954 cc              int     3
0:000&gt; rrax
rax=00000000000000cc
</code></pre><p>Can we add as many prefixes as we want? You can add quite a few until you get to 15 bytes<sup>1</sup>. This length is a hard limit on current x86-compatible CPUs. Any instruction longer than 15 bytes is considered invalid and will generate an exception.</p><p>There are also some other weird prefixes that you might not know about. The “Address override” prefix can be used to reference a 32-bit address when running in 64-bit mode.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>488d0424        lea     rax,[rsp]
67488d0424      lea     rax,[esp] # Note the extra '0x67' prefix
</code></pre><p>And when running 32-bit code, it will switch the address mode to 16-bit addresses! I don’t know that I’ve ever seen a compiler generate code like that, but it’s there. Something interesting to note, however, is that disassembling or interpreting these bytes correctly relies on knowing the default operand size and address size of a code segment (which can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_descriptor">configured by the kernel</a>). If we disassemble the same bytes in 32-bit mode and 64-bit mode, we can get different results.</p><p>In 32-bit mode:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>8b0424          mov     eax,dword ptr [esp]
</code></pre><p>In 64-bit mode:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>8b0424          mov     eax,dword ptr [rsp]
</code></pre><p>It’s not just address sizes either. The entire range that was previous dedicated to <code>INC reg</code> and <code>DEC reg</code> on x86 (40-4F) is now used for the <a href="https://twitter.com/ivanrouzanov/status/1616933010707972097">REX prefix bytes</a> on x64!</p><p>In 32-bit mode, we have this:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>48              dec     eax
030424          add     eax,dword ptr [esp]
</code></pre><p>But in 64-bit mode, those two instructions have merged to form a single instruction!</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>48030424        add     rax,qword ptr [rsp]
</code></pre><p>The encoding space used by <code>INC</code> and <code>DEC</code> was quite large, so it’s understandable why the AMD64 designers decided to use these bytes for the new prefixes to expand the register set in 64 bit mode. There was already a different encoding for these instructions that supported both registers and memory locations, so nothing was really lost (except a slightly larger encoding for a somewhat infrequent instruction).</p><p>I’ll also note that due to this peculiarity and due to the fact that WinDbg will always assemble instructions as if they are in 32-bit mode, trying to assemble an “INC reg” instruction will always fail, because it will generate the single byte form which is actually a REX prefix.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>0:000&gt; a. 
00007ff8`4bfc0950 inc eax
00007ff8`4bfc0951 
0:000&gt; u .
ntdll!LdrpDoDebuggerBreak+0x30:
00007ff8`4bfc0950 40eb00          jmp     ntdll!LdrpDoDebuggerBreak+0x33 (00007ff8`4bfc0953)
</code></pre><p>The <code>inc eax</code> here got turned into a useless REX prefix modifying the next instruction, instead of actually being an <code>inc</code> instruction.</p><h2 id="odd-flag-quirks">Odd flag quirks</h2><p>Speaking of <code>INC</code> and <code>DEC</code>, there’s a slightly odd aspect of these instructions that’s worth noting. You might thing that <code>INC EAX</code> does the same thing as <code>ADD EAX, 1</code>, but they are slightly different. An <code>ADD</code> instruction will update the carry flag but the <code>INC</code> instruction does not! This is an easy thing to miss, and when writing the TTD emulator I got this wrong initially, until I caught it with some unit tests.</p><p>There are a few other outliers worth mentioning. Most arithmetic and logical operations will set the overflow, sign, zero, auxiliary carry, parity, and carry flags. That includes the <code>CMPXCHG</code> (compare and exchange) instruction. Interestingly, it does not include the <code>CMPXCHG8B</code>/<code>CMPXCHG16B</code> instructions, which will only modify the zero flag. Weird, right?</p><p>Other instructions leave some of the flags in an undefined state, although in some cases they are <em>conditionally</em> undefined. The shift and rotate instructions leave the overflow flag undefined if the shift amount was more than one. It seems that the actual behavior of the undefined flags is related to the internal implementation of the shift operation, and is different between different architectures. I’ve heard that the Atom line of CPUs used a cheaper/slower way of doing bit shifts in the ALU, which results in the undefined flags having different values, although I haven’t tested this myself.</p><h2 id="more-surprises-with-shift-instructions">More surprises with shift instructions</h2><p>Consider this instruction:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>66c1e810        shr     ax,10h
</code></pre><p>This instruction is to shift the <code>ax</code> register by 16 bits. Since this is a 16 bit register, it will clear the register to zero. Now consider this instruction:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>c1e820          shr     eax,20h
</code></pre><p>This instruction says that it will shift the eax register 0x20 (32 decimal) bits to the right. Since this is a 32 bit register, you might think that it will clear the <code>eax</code> register. In reality, the value of eax is unchanged! If you read the details of this instruction in the Intel SDM, you’ll see that the count is masked against 1FH, essentially using only the lowest five bits of the rotation.<sup>2</sup> If the <code>REX.W</code> prefix is used, the mask will be 3FH, meaning the maximum shift is 63 bits.</p><h2 id="segment-overrides">Segment overrides</h2><p>While segmented memory might make you think we are back in the days of 16-bit code, it turns out that segments are alive and well in 32-bit and 64-bit code, and they can have real effects. We tend not to think about them very much because for the most part every OS uses a mostly-flat memory model and all of the segments have a base address of 0.<sup>3</sup> The exception to this tends to be for thread local storage, where one of the “extra segment registers” is used, either <code>FS</code> or <code>GS</code> (or both).</p><p><del>What can complicate things is the fact that usermode code doesn’t have access to the CPU configuration that determines the base address of the FS or GS segments. So if you want to know what flat address corresponds to <code>GS:0x12345678</code>, there’s no way to determine that directly unless the OS has a way of querying this information.</del></p><p><strong>CORRECTION</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/sixtyvividtails/status/1621532553873080322">Sixtyvividtails points out</a> that you can read the base of fs/gs segs using the rdfsbase/wrfsbase/rdgsbase/wrgsbase instructions, which are available in unprivileged code. These instructions are available starting on Ivy Bridge (from 2012). Thanks for the correction, sixtyvividtails!</p><p>On Windows, these registers are used for referring to the TEB (Thread Execution Block), and these structures conveniently have a “self” pointer with a flat address to the start of the structure, which also happens to be the base of the segment.</p><p>In 32-bit processes, the TEB is located using <code>FS</code>. We can see how the OS does this by looking at the disassembly of the GetLastError function, which simply accesses a field out of the TEB.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>0:000&gt; u kernelbase!GetLastError

</code></pre><p>It might seem odd that that 64-bit processes use a different segment register for the TEB than a 32-bit process, but there is a very good reason for this. A 32-bit process on a 64-bit OS will have both a 32-bit TEB <em>and</em> a 64-bit TEB, and in some contexts it can be useful to have access to both TEBs (such as the 64-bit WOW code that runs in a 32-bit process).</p><h2 id="segment-overrides-more-trivia">Segment overrides: More trivia</h2><p>I mentioned earlier that the base address of the FS segment and GS segment is determined by CPU configuration. You might be wondering “what CPU configuration?” And the answer is “it depends”. Specifically, it depends on whether you’re in 32-bit mode or 64-bit mode. In 32-bit mode, the actual value of the segment register is used to reference a segment descriptor (defined by the <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Global_Descriptor_Table">Global Descriptor Table</a> and <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Local_Descriptor_Table">Local Descriptor Table</a>). But in 64-bit mode, the base is controlled by two MSRs, the FS Base (IA32_FS_BASE in the Intel SDM) and GS Base (IA32_GS_BASE). A side effect of this scheme is that the actual value of FS and GS don’t matter at all in 64-bit mode. You can see the effect of this in WinDbg by trying to directly read from something in one of those segments. When debugging a 32-bit process, you can dump the contents of the “FS segment” by using the value of the FS register:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>0:000&gt; rfs
fs=00000053
0:000&gt; db 53:0
0053:00000000  60 f2 2f 03 00 00 30 03-00 30 20 03 00 00 00 00 `./...0..0 .....
</code></pre><p>If you try the same thing on a 64-bit process, it doesn’t work because the segment values don’t matter, only the segment override prefixes!</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>0:000&gt; rfs

Most of it totally useless unless you want to write an emulator (which I <em>highly</em> recommend if you ever get the chance). I still think it’s sort of interesting, and gives a little bit of insight into how things “really work”. Some of this I learned through trial and error, but I had some great mentors while writing an x86 emulator, one of whom was Darek Mihocka, who has been doing emulators long enough that he owns <a href="http://emulators.com/">emulators.com</a>. I’d never claim to be an expert myself, but if this sort of thing is interesting to you make sure to check out the fantastic resources on <a href="https://www.agner.org/optimize/">Agner Fog’s website</a>.

Besides the length limitation, some prefixes are also more strict about when they can be used, such as the <code>LOCK</code> prefix (F0)</p><p><sup>2</sup> This actually came up in an interview question at Microsoft. My interviewer was asking me all the ways you could clear a 32-bit register in a single instruction.
