<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Inspired by numerous people migrating their Next.js applications from Vercel to self-hosted VPS on Hetzner due to pricing concerns, I decided to explore self-hosting some of my non-critical applications. Additionally, I wanted to push my technical boundaries by running Llama 3.2 using Ollama and making its API available to power AI applications for my business, Wisp.</p><p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lLmNeOP7HXG0OqaG97wimw/clwdlsohu0000v1qer09du8mo/f532cf09-87ff-435b-bede-be0677b4419f.jpg/public" alt="Home server as a step stool"></p><p>The objective was to breathe new life into an old home server that once ran high-frequency trading and MEV algorithms but had since become a step stool for my daughter to climb onto the TV console.</p><p>This blog post chronicles my journey of setting up Coolify to run Ollama (using Llama 3.2) on my home server, with a particular focus on the challenges and triumphs of enabling GPU acceleration using the CUDA toolkit.</p><p>(Update)</p><p>Since some of you are curious, this is how Llama 3.2 3B perform on a GeForce RTX 2060:</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vhJ6fNW8AI"></iframe></p><h2>My Goals</h2><p>The primary idea was to leverage my home server, previously gathering dust, to perform valuable tasks. Specifically, I wanted it to host and automate AI-related functions. Additionally, this setup would provide a centralized location to run Supabase for storing various data. The broader goal includes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Serving a Next.js website</strong>: This site should be live on the public Internet, auto-deploy from the master branch, work with a public subdomain, and maintain no open public ports for security.</p></li><li><p><strong>Running Llama 3.2</strong>: Utilizing the GPU for agentic tasks and making a locally accessible API.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wildcard domain</strong>: Enabling new services to spin up effortlessly under varied subdomains.</p></li></ul><h2>Overall Experience</h2><p>Setting up this environment was no small feat, but each step was a valuable learning experience. Here's a walkthrough of my journey:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Installing Ubuntu 24</strong>: This was a breeze, requiring only a single reboot.</p></li><li><p><strong>Coolify Installation</strong>: The process was smooth thanks to the handy install script, which ensured most prerequisites were met. A minor hiccup was resolved by running commands as root to avoid permission issues with the <code>/data</code> directory.</p></li><li><p><strong>Configuring Coolify</strong>: Initially, setting the server as <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost/">localhost</a> prevented assigning a domain via Cloudflare Tunnel. The fix involved adding the host as a second 'server'. Moreover, configuring the tunnel and SSL correctly took time but was crucial for security and functionality.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cloudflare Tunnel</strong>: Patience was key here. The wildcard domain setup was essential, and understanding the nuances of Cloudflare’s free SSL certificate coverage saved time and money.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deployment Wins</strong>: Successfully hosting my personal blog using Coolify over a Cloudflare Tunnel was a significant morale boost, fueling the energy needed to proceed with the Ollama setup.</p></li><li><p><strong>Running Ollama</strong>: Coolify made deploying the Ollama service straightforward. However, initial trials showed slow inference speeds and heavy CPU usage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enabling GPU</strong>: Ubuntu 24 had the NVIDIA drivers pre-installed, but CUDA toolkit installation and configuration posed challenges. Persistent efforts led to discovering the need for the <code>nvidia-container-toolkit</code> and Docker service configuration modifications to enable GPU usage. The results were remarkable, reducing inference time by over 10x.</p></li><li><p><strong>API Exposure</strong>: Securing the LLM API with an API key became the next challenge. After unsuccessful attempts with nginx, I found potential solutions by using Caddy. Something I'll work on next after writing this post.</p></li></ol><h2><strong>Server Specifications</strong></h2><p>For context, here are the specifications of my home server:</p><ul><li><p><strong>CPU</strong>: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core</p></li><li><p><strong>GPU</strong>: GeForce RTX 2060</p></li><li><p><strong>RAM</strong>: 4 x 16GB DDR4 3200 MT/s</p></li><li><p><strong>SSD</strong>: 2TB SSD + 8TB SSD</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Step-by-Step Guide</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. Install Ubuntu (For a New Setup)</strong></h3><p>Start by installing Ubuntu on your home server. Follow the detailed guide available on the <a target="_blank" href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop"><strong>official Ubuntu website</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Important Settings:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Avoid using LVM or disk encryption for a smoother reboot experience and easier server management. Note that this trade-off means anyone with physical access can read your data.</p></li><li><p>Ensure the installation of third-party drivers to automatically get the NVIDIA driver.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Install SSH</strong></h3><p>Enable SSH to access your server remotely, which is especially useful if you’re managing it from another machine on your local network. Refer to this <a target="_blank" href="https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-enable-ssh-on-ubuntu-20-04/"><strong>SSH setup guide for Ubuntu 20.04</strong></a>, suitable for Ubuntu 24 as well.</p><h3><strong>Update and Upgrade APT</strong></h3><p>Always perform an update and upgrade for your packages:</p><pre><code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y</code></pre><h3>Useful Commands</h3><p>Here are some additional commands for printing information about your machine and setup:</p><ul><li><p>View CPU usage: <code>htop</code></p></li><li><p>List NVIDIA graphics card information: <code>lspci | grep -i nvidia</code></p></li><li><p>Print architecture, OS distro, release: <code>uname -m &amp;&amp; cat /etc/*release</code></p></li><li><p>Print physical RAM installed: <code>sudo dmidecode --type memory | less</code></p></li><li><p>Print processor info: <code>cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep 'name'| uniq</code></p></li><li><p>Check NVIDIA driver information: <code>nvidia-smi</code></p></li></ul><h3><strong>2. Installing Coolify</strong></h3><p><a target="_blank" href="https://coolify.io/">Coolify</a> is an open-source platform designed to make deploying and managing your applications on self-hosted environments easier. Its key feature is allowing users to manage full-stack applications, databases, and services without relying on complex Kubernetes setups. Coolify streamlines deployments through a user-friendly interface, supporting services like Docker, GitHub, and GitLab.</p><p>To install Coolify, follow the automated installation instructions from <a target="_blank" href="https://coolify.io/docs/installation/">their documentation</a>:</p><pre><code>curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash</code></pre><p><strong>Important Notes</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Ensure you’re logged in as the root user to avoid permission issues.</p></li><li><p>The installation script checks prerequisites, but you may need to troubleshoot some dependency errors if they arise.</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lLmNeOP7HXG0OqaG97wimw/clwdlsohu0000v1qer09du8mo/43c2d6eb-aba3-45ab-aad9-0f47e8895fa5.png/public" alt="Coolify onboarding screen"></p><p>Once Coolify is installed:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Visit the coolify dashboard</strong> at <code>http://localhost:8000</code> . This is also available on the network. Replace localhost with the ip address of the server if you are accessing it from another machine.</p></li><li><p><strong>Set up an admin account</strong> - this is stored locally on your server.</p></li><li><p><strong>Create your first project</strong> by adding a resource and deploying it to <code>localhost</code>. In my case, I deployed my personal blog first to test the setup.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>3. Setting Up a Cloudflare Tunnel on Coolify</strong></h3><p>Cloudflare Tunnel is a secure way to expose services running on your local network to the public internet without having to open ports on your router. For my setup, this was a key feature, as I wanted to keep my server behind a firewall while still allowing external access to some services.</p><p>Cloudflare’s Zero Trust platform ensures that all traffic is encrypted and routed securely, preventing unauthorized access.</p><p>To set up a Cloudflare Tunnel, follow this instructions on Coolify’s <a target="_blank" href="https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels">official documentation</a>. The key is to focus on setting up <strong>wildcard subdomains</strong> for all your services.</p><p>A few key caveats:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Localhost Server Issue</strong>: You cannot assign a domain to the pre-created <code>localhost</code> server directly. To solve this, add your host as a second server within Coolify, using the IP address <code>172.17.0.1</code> for <code>host.docker.internal</code> (since coolify will show an error that <code>host.docker.internal</code> has already been assigned to a server).</p></li><li><p><strong>Wildcard Domain Setup</strong>: Make sure you use a top-level domain like <code>*.example.com</code>. If you use a wildcard on a subdomain, Cloudflare will not provide a free SSL certificate, unless you opt for the ACM plan.</p></li></ol><p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lLmNeOP7HXG0OqaG97wimw/clwdlsohu0000v1qer09du8mo/4c338964-bf9d-4466-975a-fca268f56795.png/public"></p><p>After setting up the Cloudflare Tunnel:</p><ul><li><p>Deploy your resources to the newly added server.</p></li><li><p>Change the domain in the service configuration to match your new subdomain.</p></li><li><p>Once everything is deployed, you should be able to access your service live from its custom domain.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>4. Deploying Ollama</strong></h3><p>Once you’ve set up your Coolify project, the next step is to deploy Ollama. This service allows you to run large language models (LLMs) like Llama 3.2 on your server with a web-based interface.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Add a New Resource</strong>: In your Coolify project, select "Add Resource" and choose <strong>Ollama with Open WebUI</strong> as the service you want to deploy to your new server.</p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lLmNeOP7HXG0OqaG97wimw/clwdlsohu0000v1qer09du8mo/2b634b6c-17db-4f5c-afba-615b4cc1cef0.png/public" alt="Deploying Ollama in Coolify"></li><li><p><strong>Configure the Domain</strong>: After adding Ollama, configure the domain for the Open WebUI service. Assign a domain from the wildcard domain you set up earlier through Cloudflare Tunnel. This will allow you to access the Ollama WebUI directly from the internet.</p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lLmNeOP7HXG0OqaG97wimw/clwdlsohu0000v1qer09du8mo/d7eb2920-5e28-47b9-9d02-9cb3740ca3b5.png/public" alt="Configuring domain on Coolify resource"></li><li><p><strong>Deploy the Service</strong>: Once everything is set up, click on "Deploy."</p><p>You should now be able to access the Open WebUI via the assigned domain. Upon your first login, you'll be prompted to create an admin account. This is important for managing models and access through the UI.</p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lLmNeOP7HXG0OqaG97wimw/clwdlsohu0000v1qer09du8mo/69c5be6f-4570-4bea-b334-123c5b9cb25f.png/public" alt="WebUI for Ollama"></li><li><p><strong>Install Llama 3.2</strong>: With your admin account set up, you can now install the latest Llama model. Head to <a target="_blank" href="https://ollama.com/library">Ollama's library</a> and search for the Llama model you want to use. I opted for <strong>Llama 3.2</strong>, which can be installed using the tag <code>llama3.2</code>.</p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lLmNeOP7HXG0OqaG97wimw/clwdlsohu0000v1qer09du8mo/6d081703-a0eb-4412-97d0-05bb765f3afc.png/public" alt="Downloading models using WebUI with Ollama"></li><li><p><strong>Try Your First Chat</strong>: Once installed, initiate your first chat with Llama 3.2 via the web interface. During this phase, your model will likely run on the CPU, so expect to hear your machine working hard (with increased CPU fan noise).</p><p>To monitor your machine’s performance during this, use the following commands:</p><ul><li><p><code>htop</code> to keep an eye on <strong>CPU usage</strong>.</p></li><li><p><code>watch -n 0.5 nvidia-smi</code> to track <strong>GPU usage</strong> (though at this stage, GPU may not be utilized yet).</p></li></ul><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lLmNeOP7HXG0OqaG97wimw/clwdlsohu0000v1qer09du8mo/6052bfb2-63bb-49cf-a75b-c4f643dee830.png/public" alt="Crazy CPU usage when Llama 3.2 runs using CPU"></li></ol><h3><strong>5. Configuring Ollama to Use GPU</strong></h3><p>Large language models (LLMs) like Llama 3.2 perform significantly better with GPU acceleration. GPUs, particularly those from NVIDIA, are optimized for the heavy parallel computations involved in AI workloads, which is where CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) comes into play. The CUDA toolkit enables direct GPU acceleration for applications like Ollama, drastically reducing inference time and CPU load.</p><p>This is arguably the most challenging step in setting up Ollama on your server, but here’s a breakdown of the process:</p><ol><li><p><strong>(Already Done)</strong>: Install the NVIDIA driver (this should have been handled during your Ubuntu installation).</p></li><li><p><strong>Install the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit</strong>: This toolkit is necessary to unlock GPU acceleration.</p></li><li><p><strong>(Optional)</strong>: Test that the CUDA toolkit is working correctly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit</strong>: This will allow Docker containers (like Ollama) to access the GPU.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enable the Ollama service in Coolify to use the GPU</strong>.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Install the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit</strong></p><p>Follow NVIDIA’s official <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#ubuntu">installation guide</a> to install the CUDA toolkit for your system. I recommend using the <strong>network repository installation method</strong> for the most flexibility and ease of updates.</p><ol><li><p>Install the new <code>cuda-keyring</code> package:</p><pre><code>wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/&lt;distro&gt;/&lt;arch&gt;/cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb</code></pre><p>Replace <code>&lt;distro&gt;/&lt;arch&gt;</code> with the appropriate value for your distribution and architecture:</p><ul><li><p><code>ubuntu2004/arm64</code></p></li><li><p><code>ubuntu2004/sbsa</code></p></li><li><p><code>ubuntu2004/x86_64</code></p></li><li><p><code>ubuntu2204/sbsa</code></p></li><li><p><code>ubuntu2204/x86_64</code></p></li><li><p><code>ubuntu2404/sbsa</code></p></li><li><p><code>ubuntu2404/x86_64</code></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Update the APT repository cache:</p><pre><code>sudo apt-get update</code></pre></li><li><p>Install the CUDA SDK:</p><pre><code>sudo apt-get install cuda-toolkit</code></pre></li><li><p>Set up the environment for CUDA by adding its binaries to your PATH:</p><pre><code>export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.6/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}</code></pre></li><li><p>Reboot the system to ensure all configurations take effect:</p><pre><code>sudo reboot</code></pre></li></ol><p><strong>(Optional) Test that CUDA Toolkit Works</strong></p><p>To ensure that your system is correctly configured for GPU acceleration, test the CUDA installation by compiling and running sample programs provided by NVIDIA (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nvidia/cuda-samples">https://github.com/nvidia/cuda-samples</a>).</p><ol><li><p>First, install the necessary build tools:</p><pre><code>sudo apt install build-essential</code></pre></li><li><p>Clone the CUDA sample repository and build the sample projects:</p><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/nvidia/cuda-samples
cd cuda-samples
make</code></pre></li><li><p>Navigate to the compiled binaries and run the <code>deviceQuery</code> tool to verify your GPU and CUDA installation:</p><pre><code>cd bin/x86_64/linux/release
./deviceQuery</code></pre><p>You should see detailed information about your GPU and CUDA environment, confirming that the toolkit is working correctly.</p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lLmNeOP7HXG0OqaG97wimw/clwdlsohu0000v1qer09du8mo/fba84378-4c3c-4712-9230-ba2476654826.png/public" alt="deviceQuery showing CUDA Capable device(s)"></li></ol><p><strong>Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit</strong></p><p>To enable Docker containers to access your GPU, you'll need to install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit. This toolkit allows Docker to offload GPU-intensive operations to your NVIDIA GPU, essential for speeding up tasks like model inference with Ollama.</p><p>Follow the steps below from <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/r/ollama/ollama">Ollama docker docs</a> to install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Configure the repository</strong>:</p><pre><code>curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey \
    | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list \
    | sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' \
    | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list
sudo apt-get update</code></pre></li><li><p><strong>Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit packages</strong>:</p><pre><code>sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit</code></pre></li></ol><p>With the container toolkit installed, Docker will now be able to use your GPU.</p><p><strong>Enable Ollama Service in Coolify to Use GPU</strong></p><p>To enable GPU support for the Ollama service in Coolify, you'll need to modify the Docker Compose file to allow access to all the GPUs on the host machine.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Edit the Compose File</strong>: Navigate to the Ollama service in Coolify and select "Edit Compose File."</p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lLmNeOP7HXG0OqaG97wimw/clwdlsohu0000v1qer09du8mo/b3cff181-410b-49fc-82fe-6bfbe0280854.png/public" alt="Edit compose file in Coolify"></li><li><p><strong>Add GPU Configuration</strong>: Append the following configuration under the <code>ollama-api</code> resource. This enables Docker to utilize all GPUs available on the host system:</p><pre><code>    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            -
              driver: nvidia
              count: all
              capabilities:
                - gpu</code></pre></li><li><p><strong>Restart the Service</strong>: After saving the changes, restart the Ollama service by clicking the "Restart" button in Coolify.</p></li></ol><p>Once restarted, Ollama will now leverage your GPU for model inference. You can verify that it's using the GPU by running:</p><ul><li><p><code>htop</code> to check CPU usage (it should remain low).</p></li><li><p><code>watch -n 0.5 nvidia-smi</code> to see the GPU usage in action.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Testing GPU Performance</strong></p><p>Try initiating another conversation with Llama 3.2 via the web UI. This time, you should notice a significant reduction in CPU load, as the GPU will handle the inference tasks.</p><p>Congratulations! You’ve successfully configured Ollama to use GPU acceleration through Coolify on your home server!</p><h3><strong>Next Steps</strong></h3><p>The final step in securing your setup is to expose the LLM API to the internet while ensuring it’s protected by an API key.

			<h2 id="when-personhood-is-decided-by-the-big-five">When “personhood” is decided by the Big Five</h2>
<p>My partner and I recently moved states in order to benefit from lower rent and a
more affordable living environment. We found a place on Craigslist for the
winter that was not only scam-free, but extremely cute. We visited it in person,
met the landlord, and agreed to tenancy until April after the threat of frost.
The process, despite its rushed quality, was rather straightforward.</p>
<p>However, we started running into problems when we began updating our address.
Google, it seemed, never heard of our road let alone the fact that there were
houses on it.</p>
<p>I first noticed this issue when I went to update my address with my online
credit union. I was told, in no uncertain terms that the street didn’t exist
after I overrode the Google Maps autocomplete. When I switched to our PO Box
number, an error message popped up and said that “PO Boxes were not appropriate
addresses.”</p>
<p>And so our saga began.</p>
<p>The town, thankfully, knew of the road and gave us no problems when it came to
hyper-local needs like car registration at the downtown office. Signing up for a
new phone service left us both screaming at the computer, then eventually
settling with putting our address as the post office (because, again, PO boxes
aren’t “appropriate addresses”). We just hoped that the town being small enough
would make it so they would know where to put mail should something ever come
from the phone company or any other service that used Google to verify
addresses.</p>
<p>Getting a license was also difficult, since mail was rarely delivered to our
physical address. Instead, both of us needed to sign an affadavit…to prove
that the other person lived with us or at least wasn’t lying about living in the
state.</p>
<p>Which, when you think about it, is weird, right?</p>
<p>Go in with enough random people to say you lived at a place and that was more
legitimate than a letter with your address on top from a propane company that
served half the state.</p>
<p>The letter, you see, doesn’t count because it wasn’t a bill with the account
number on it, even though the mysterious street address was. But of course new
tenants wouldn’t have a bill with the account number on it yet since they had
only just moved in! Proof of car insurance wasn’t enough either because it only
had our mailing address, which is a PO Box…and well, we know what Serious
Institutions think of PO Boxes.</p>
<p>And while we have figured at least some of this out, we also had difficulty
discerning where to begin. Since, to get the PO Box at all, USPS had to know
where we lived and that we had proof of living in the town we wanted the PO Box
at…which caused a headache with Google Maps autocomplete again. Because of
Google, our address wasn’t even present for the USPS, who should have more say
than Google about what is and isn’t an address! It took a sympathetic postmaster
to help us out in person, since everyone in that office had delivered local mail
to our address previously, so knew we weren’t making things up.</p>
<p>This entire debacle is worth mentioning in as full of detail as possible for two
reasons: (1) It shows the extent to which Google can dictate our lives and how
we get to live it. (2) Proof of address is needed for so many things, down to the
basic necessities to be legal within this country.</p>
<p>If I don’t have an address, I cannot have a bank account. I cannot get a
driver’s license, register my car, vote in my town. I cannot even get a library
card.</p>
<p>For an entire week, I was a non-person to this country’s bureaucracy, which in
some respects <em>should</em> feel freeing, but in the end was a massive pain in the
ass. It was frightening to consider that something as simple as an address not
showing up on the world’s most popular maps app meant that, without the
intervention of locals who understood what it meant to live in a largely
unmarked rural area, this non-personhood would’ve potentially been permanent.</p>
<p>On a larger scale, it made me concerned for the use of AI in these kinds of
situations. What if I wasn’t able to intercept a human postmaster who could then
look at my documents and say that I was able to have a PO Box to receive mail
from outside of town? Or talk to a DMV associate who could see that my partner
was right beside me and could vouch for my legitimacy as a state resident?</p>
<p>Technology, of course, is falliable. It cannot account for all cases, all
possibilities. And forbid the thought of politics entering into it. These tools
can easily be manipulated further to label anyone outside of the white,
heteronormative, cisgender conglomerate as a non-person in the eyes of the
larger system. All they need is a huge company like Google to “not recognize” a
few key factors like whole neighborhoods in redlined areas or a gender marker
(as compared to a birth certificate or something).</p>
<p>If nothing else, I learned that nothing beats talking to a real, live human
being, especially those that are just down the street.</p>

<p>Graphite is designed principally as a desktop-grade professional application that is also accessible in-browser for fast, casual usage.</p>
<p>Where's the download? Desktop apps for Windows, Mac, and Linux should be available later in 2024. Until then, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361" target="_blank">install it as a PWA</a>.</p>
<p>Developing and maintaining a native app on four platforms is a big task. To not compromise on the optimal desktop experience—which takes longer to do the right way—priorities called for initially supporting just web, the one platform that stays up-to-date and reaches all devices.</p>
<p>Once it's ready to shine, Graphite's code architecture is structured to deliver native performance for your graphically intensive workloads on desktop platforms and very low overhead on the web thanks to WebAssembly and WebGPU, new high-performance browser technologies.</p>

<div id="proceduralism">
<div>

<hr>
<p>Graphite is the first and only graphic design package built for procedural editing — where everything is nondestructive.</p>
</div>
<div>

<p>Save hours on tedious alterations and make better creative choices. Graphite lets you iterate rapidly by adjusting node parameters instead of individual elements.</p>
<p>Scatter circles with just a couple nodes...<br>
Want them denser? Bigger? Those are sliders.<br>
Want a different placement area? Just tweak the path.</p>
<p><a href="https://editor.graphite.rs/#demo/red-dress">Open this artwork</a> and give it a try yourself.</p>
</div>
<div>

<p>Nondestructive editing means every decision is tied to a parameter you can adjust later on. Use Graphite to interpolate between any states just by dragging sliders.</p>
<p>Blend across color schemes. Morph shapes before they're scattered around the canvas. The possibilities are endless.</p>

Awnings. They were ubiquitous over nearly every window of buildings from the most basic single family home to massive buildings like The White House.</p> <p>Where did all these awnings go and why did they disappear? Before we answer that let’s look at what an awning actually does for a building.</p> <h2>How Do Awnings Work?</h2> <p>Awnings were and still are extremely effective at blocking solar heat gain through windows. We often look at builders from the 19th century with a pitying condescension like they just weren’t as smart as we are today. To me it’s really despicable the lack of respect we give these incredibly talented contractors who were able to design and construct these solid structures that have withstood the test of time without the use of computers, power tools, or energy codes.</p> <div> <figure><img width="500" height="384" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://cdn-adeaj.nitrocdn.com/izJGWTXvtlwmDhipoFmdgKSxsmoFktuh/assets/images/optimized/rev-7b52977/thecraftsmanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/E8523F4B-C6C7-43B7-8262-BC10D21A60DC.jpeg 500w, https://cdn-adeaj.nitrocdn.com/izJGWTXvtlwmDhipoFmdgKSxsmoFktuh/assets/images/optimized/rev-7b52977/thecraftsmanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/E8523F4B-C6C7-43B7-8262-BC10D21A60DC-300x230.jpeg 300w, https://cdn-adeaj.nitrocdn.com/izJGWTXvtlwmDhipoFmdgKSxsmoFktuh/assets/images/optimized/rev-7b52977/thecraftsmanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/E8523F4B-C6C7-43B7-8262-BC10D21A60DC-78x60.jpeg 78w, https://cdn-adeaj.nitrocdn.com/izJGWTXvtlwmDhipoFmdgKSxsmoFktuh/assets/images/optimized/rev-7b52977/thecraftsmanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/E8523F4B-C6C7-43B7-8262-BC10D21A60DC-150x115.jpeg 150w" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-adeaj.nitrocdn.com/izJGWTXvtlwmDhipoFmdgKSxsmoFktuh/assets/images/optimized/rev-7b52977/thecraftsmanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/E8523F4B-C6C7-43B7-8262-BC10D21A60DC.jpeg" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDM4NCIgd2lkdGg9IjUwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIzODQiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+"></figure></div> <p>They built these structures with incredibly clever passive heating and cooling systems like the <a href="https://thecraftsmanblog.com/why-are-there-double-hung-windows/">double-hung window</a>, making the best of the technological limitations of their day to create buildings that could keep people relatively comfortably even in extreme temperatures and awnings were a major part of that.</p> <p>Awnings work by covering the top portion of window and thereby blocking the high summer sun from pouring into the window and heating the room. Since in the winter the sun is lower in the sky the awning, when positioned and sized properly, allows the winter sun into the room to warm things up.</p> <p>No adjusting, no tweaking, just completely passive heating in the winter and cooling in the summer by a thoughtful design. The metal frame could last for decades without needing changing, and the fabric covering would need to be replaced every 8-10 years depending on exposure and climate.</p> <div> <figure><img width="568" height="450" alt="white house awnings" sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://cdn-adeaj.nitrocdn.com/izJGWTXvtlwmDhipoFmdgKSxsmoFktuh/assets/images/optimized/rev-7b52977/thecraftsmanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/7AABF1AE-48DC-41C8-A6ED-059779EBE270.webp 568w, https://cdn-adeaj.nitrocdn.com/izJGWTXvtlwmDhipoFmdgKSxsmoFktuh/assets/images/optimized/rev-7b52977/thecraftsmanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/7AABF1AE-48DC-41C8-A6ED-059779EBE270-300x238.webp 300w, https://cdn-adeaj.nitrocdn.com/izJGWTXvtlwmDhipoFmdgKSxsmoFktuh/assets/images/optimized/rev-7b52977/thecraftsmanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/7AABF1AE-48DC-41C8-A6ED-059779EBE270-76x60.webp 76w, https://cdn-adeaj.nitrocdn.com/izJGWTXvtlwmDhipoFmdgKSxsmoFktuh/assets/images/optimized/rev-7b52977/thecraftsmanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/7AABF1AE-48DC-41C8-A6ED-059779EBE270-150x119.webp 150w" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-adeaj.nitrocdn.com/izJGWTXvtlwmDhipoFmdgKSxsmoFktuh/assets/images/optimized/rev-7b52977/thecraftsmanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/7AABF1AE-48DC-41C8-A6ED-059779EBE270.webp" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTY4IDQ1MCIgd2lkdGg9IjU2OCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI0NTAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+"></figure></div> <h2>Why Awnings Disappeared</h2> <p>So where did all the awnings go? Two simple words…air conditioning. Before the widespread adoption of air conditioning, awnings were the preferred way to keep buildings cooler. But just because we invented AC does that mean we don’t need the help that awnings provide?</p> <p>In the middle of the 20th century as air conditioning was gradually installed in homes across America, awnings came down or wore out and were not replaced because now we had the technology to mechanically cool our buildings.</p> <p>Energy costs were relatively cheap in those decades and one generation later when energy prices jumped up during the 1970s people seemed to have forgotten about awnings for energy savings. We jumped into the insulation craze and began stuffing fiberglass into every wall and ceiling as fast as possible, forgetting what our fathers and grandfathers knew to be true. If you kept the sun out of the windows you could keep the heat out of the building.</p> <p>Today, awnings are mainly used as signage for storefronts and coverings to keep rain off of customers. Retractable awnings to cover decks and patios have picked up in the ensuing decades and remain a market for manufacturers, but the days of covering individual windows with awnings have gone away.</p> <p>In this age of increasing energy prices, I’m hopeful the awning will swing back into popularity since it is an extremely simple way to keep temperatures moderated throughout the year. Time will tell. How about you? Would you consider adding awnings to your house to keep your heating and cooling costs down? If not then why?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>At the Open Compute Project (OCP) Global Summit 2024, we’re showcasing our latest open AI hardware designs with the OCP community.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>These innovations include a new AI platform, cutting-edge open rack designs, and advanced network fabrics and components.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>By sharing our designs, we hope to inspire collaboration and foster innovation. If you’re passionate about building the future of AI, we invite you to engage with us and OCP to help shape the next generation of open hardware for AI.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>AI has been at the core of the experiences Meta has been delivering to people and businesses for years, including AI modeling innovations to optimize and improve on features like </span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/facebook-feed-improvements-ai-show-more-less/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Feed</span></a><span> and our </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/07/10/data-infrastructure/machine-learning-ml-prediction-robustness-meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>ads system</span></a><span>. As we develop and release new, advanced AI models, we are also driven to advance our infrastructure to support our new and emerging AI workloads.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, </span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Llama 3.1 405B</span></a><span>, Meta’s largest model, is a dense transformer with 405B parameters and a context window of up to 128k tokens. To train a large language model (LLM) of this magnitude, with over 15 trillion tokens, we had to make substantial optimizations to our entire training stack. This effort pushed our infrastructure to operate across more than 16,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, making Llama 3.1 405B the first model in the Llama series to be trained at such a massive scale.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Prior to Llama, our largest AI jobs ran on 128 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. ​But things have rapidly accelerated. ​Over the course of 2023, we rapidly scaled up our training clusters from 1K, 2K, 4K, to eventually 16K GPUs to support our AI workloads. Today, we’re training our models on two</span> <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/12/data-center-engineering/building-metas-genai-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>24K-GPU clusters</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>We don’t expect this upward trajectory for AI clusters to slow down any time soon. In fact, we expect the amount of compute needed for AI training will grow significantly from where we are today.</span></p>
<p><span>Building AI clusters requires more than just GPUs. Networking and bandwidth play an important role in ensuring the clusters’ performance. Our systems consist of a tightly integrated HPC compute system and an isolated high-bandwidth compute network that connects all our GPUs and domain-specific accelerators. This design is necessary to meet our injection needs and address the challenges posed by our need for bisection bandwidth.</span></p>
<p><span>In the next few years, we anticipate greater injection bandwidth on the order of a terabyte per second, per accelerator, with equal normalized bisection bandwidth. This represents a growth of more than an order of magnitude compared to today’s networks!</span></p>
<p><span>To support this growth, we need a high-performance, multi-tier, non-blocking network fabric that can utilize modern congestion control to behave predictably under heavy load. This will enable us to fully leverage the power of our AI clusters and ensure they continue to perform optimally as we push the boundaries of what is possible with AI.</span></p>
<p><span>Scaling AI at this speed requires open hardware solutions. Developing new architectures, network fabrics, and system designs is the most efficient and impactful when we can build it on principles of openness. By investing in open hardware, we unlock AI’s full potential and propel ongoing innovation in the field.</span></p>
<h2><span>Introducing Catalina: Open Architecture for AI Infra</span></h2>

<p><span>Today, we announced the upcoming release of Catalina, our new high-powered rack designed for AI workloads, to the OCP community. Catalina is based on the <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-contributes-blackwell-platform-design-to-open-hardware-ecosystem-accelerating-ai-infrastructure-innovation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Blackwell platform full rack-scale solution</a>, with a focus on modularity and flexibility. It is built to support the latest NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip, ensuring it meets the growing demands of modern AI infrastructure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The growing power demands of GPUs means open rack solutions need to support higher power capability. With Catalina we’re introducing the Orv3, a high-power rack (HPR) capable of supporting up to 140kW.</span></p>
<p><span>The full solution is liquid cooled and consists of a power shelf that supports a compute tray, switch tray, the Orv3 HPR, the</span> <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/11/09/data-center-engineering/ocp-summit-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Wedge 400</span></a><span> fabric switch, a management switch, battery backup unit, and a rack management controller.</span></p>
<p><span>We aim for Catalina’s modular design to empower others to customize the rack to meet their specific AI workloads while leveraging both existing and emerging industry standards.</span></p>

<p><span>In 2022, we announced </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/10/18/open-source/ocp-summit-2022-grand-teton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Grand Teton</span></a><span>, our next-generation AI platform (the follow-up to our Zion-EX platform). Grand Teton is designed with compute capacity to support the demands of memory-bandwidth-bound workloads, such as Meta’s <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/dlrm-an-advanced-open-source-deep-learning-recommendation-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep learning recommendation models (</a></span><span>DLRMs</span><span>), as well as compute-bound workloads like content understanding.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, we have expanded the Grand Teton platform to support the AMD Instinct MI300X and will be contributing this new version to OCP. Like its predecessors, this new version of Grand Teton</span><span>&nbsp;features a single monolithic system design with fully integrated power, control, compute, and fabric interfaces. This high level of integration simplifies system deployment, enabling rapid scaling with increased reliability for large-scale AI inference workloads.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to supporting a range of accelerator designs, now including the AMD Instinct MI300x, Grand Teton offers significantly greater compute capacity, allowing faster convergence on a larger set of weights. This is complemented by expanded memory to store and run larger models locally, along with increased network bandwidth to scale up training cluster sizes efficiently.</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/15/intel_amd_x86_future/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/15/intel_amd_x86_future/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41851104">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The shape of the x86 instruction set architecture (ISA) is evolving. On Tuesday, Intel and AMD announced the formation of an ecosystem advisory group intended to drive greater consistency between the brands' x86 implementations.</p>
<p>Intel and AMD have been co-developing the x86-64 instruction for decades. But while end user workloads have enjoyed cross-compatibility between the two chipmakers' products, this has been far from universal.</p>
<p>"x86 is the de facto standard. It's a strong ecosystem, but it's one that really Intel and AMD have co-developed in a way, but an arm's length, and you know, that has caused some inefficiencies and some drift in portions of the ISA over time." AMD EVP of datacenter solutions Forrest Norrod said during a press briefing ahead of the announcement.</p>

    

<p>The introduction of advanced vector extensions (AVX) is the most obvious example of where compatibility across Intel and AMD platforms hasn't always been guaranteed.</p>

        


        

<p>For many years, those who wanted to take advantage of fat 512-bit vector registers have been limited to Intel platforms. In fact, AMD lacked support for AVX-512 until the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/10/amd_96core_epyc/">launch</a> of Zen 4 in 2022, and even then it only supported it by double pumping a 256-bit data path. It wasn't until this year's Zen 5 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/15/amd_spills_the_beans_on/">launch</a> the House of Zen added support for a full 512-bit data path.</p>
<p>Going forward, Intel, AMD, and their industry partners aim to avoid this kind of inconsistency by converging around a more uniform implementation. To support this goal, the duo has solicited the help of Broadcom, Dell, Google, HPE, HP, Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, Red Hat, as well as individuals, including Linux kernel-dev Linus Torvalds and Epic's Tim Sweeney.</p>

        

<p>This advisory group will be tasked with reshaping the x86 ISA to improve cross-compatibility, simplify software development, and address changing demands around emerging technologies.</p>
<p>"We'll have, not only will we have the benefits of performance, flexibility and compatibility across hardware, we'll have it across software, operating systems and a variety of services," Intel EVP of datacenter and AI group Justin Hotard told us.</p>
<p>"I think this will actually enable greater choice in the fundamental products, but reduce the friction of being able to choose from those choices," echoed Norrod.</p>

        

<p>However, it'll be some time before we see the group's influence realized in products. Norrod emphasized that silicon development can take months if not years. As such it's "not something that's going to reflect into products, I don't believe, in the next year or so."</p>
<p>For end users, the benefits are numerous as in theory taking advantage of either Intel or AMD's products will require less specialization, something we're sure the hyperscalers will appreciate.</p>
<p>For the long-time rivals, however, the change could have major implications for the future development of the architecture. While the two chipmakers have caught up with each other on vector extensions, Intel still has its advanced matrix extensions (AMX) for CPU-based AI inference acceleration.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether these extensions will be phased out or if some version of them will eventually make their way into AMD's Epyc and Ryzen processors. We have no doubt that either team's SoC designers would relish the opportunity to reclaim all that die area currently consumed by the NPU.</p>
<p>"I don't think we want to commit to 'we're going to support this or not support this' in a time frame. But I think the intent is we want to support things consistently," Hotard said.</p>
<p>While Norrod and Hotard declined to comment on specific changes coming to x86, recent developments, particularly on Intel's side, give us some idea of the ISA's trajectory.</p>
<p>In June, Intel published an update to its proposed <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/envisioning-future-simplified-architecture.html">x86S spec</a>, a stripped down version of the ISA free of legacy bloat — most notably 32-bit and 16-bit execution modes. As we understand it, 32-bit code would still be able to run, albeit in a compatibility mode.</p>
<p>There's also the AVX10 spec that we <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/15/avx10_intel_interviews/">looked at</a> last year, which made many of AVX512's more attractive functions. Under the new spec, AVX10 compatible chips will, for the most part, share a common feature set — including 32 registers, k-masks, and FP16 support — and minimally support 256 bit wide registers.</p>
<p>AVX10 is important for Intel which has transitioned to a dual-stack Xeon roadmap with P-and E-core CPUs, like Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest, the latter of which lacks support for AVX512.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/10/amd_epyc_turin/">AMD pumps Epyc core count to 192, clocks up to 5 GHz with Turin debut</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/15/samsung_hb3me/">Samsung's HBM3E has been a disaster, but there's a path back</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/24/intel_xeon_6p/">With Granite Rapids, Intel is back to trading blows with AMD</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/19/sifive_ai_accelerator/">SiFive expands from RISC-V cores for AI chips to designing its own full-fat accelerator</a></li>
</ul>
<p>AMD's dense Zen C-cores don't suffer from this limitation, but can be switched to a double pumped 256-bit data path to achieve lower power AVX512 support. Whether Intel will push ahead with AVX10 or borrow AMD's implementation under the newly formed advisory group is another unknown, but given enough time, we can expect the two chipmakers to coalesce around a common implementation whether it be AVX, AMX or something else.</p>
<p>That's assuming, of course, that Intel and AMD can agree on how to address industry needs.</p>
<p>With that said, a more consistent ISA could help stave off the growing number of Arm-compatible CPUs finding homes in cloud datacenters. While the exact cores used by these chips may differ — most use Arm's Neoverse cores, but some, like Ampere have developed their own — most are using either the older ARMv8 or ARMv9 ISAs, ensuring that with few exceptions code developed on one should run without issue on the other. ®</p>

<p>The C23 edition of Modern C is now available for free download from</p>



<p><a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02383654">https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02383654</a></p>



<div><p>This new edition has been the occasion to overhaul the presentation in many places, but its main purpose is the update to the new C standard, <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/82075.html">C23</a>. The goal was to publish this new edition of Modern C at the same time as the new C standard goes through the procedure of ISO publication. The closest approximation of the contents of the new standard in a publically available document can be found <a href="https://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n3220.pdf">here</a>. New releases of major compilers already implement most of the new features that it brings.</p>
<p>Among the most noticeable changes and additions that we handle are those for integers: there are new bit-precise types coined <code>_BitInt(N)</code>, new C library headers <code>(for arithmetic with overflow check) and</code> (for bit manipulation), possibilities for 128 bit types on modern architectures, and substantial improvements for enumeration types. Other new concepts in C23 include a <code>nullptr</code> constant and its underlying type, syntactic annotation with attributes, more tools for type generic programming such as type inference with <code>auto</code> and <code>typeof</code>, default initialization with <code>{}</code>, even for variable length arrays, and <code>constexpr</code> for named constants of any type. Furthermore, new material has been added, discussing compound expressions and lambdas, so-called “internationalization”, a comprehensive approach for program failure.</p>
<p>Also added has been an appendix and a temporary include header for an easy transition to C23 on existing platforms, that will allow you to start off with C23 right away.</p>
<p>Manning’s early access program (MEAP) for the new edition is still open at</p>
<p><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/modern-c-third-edition" rel="nofollow">https://www.manning.com/books/modern-c-third-edition</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately they were not yet able to tell me when their version of the C23 edition will finally be published.</p>

                 <div>The new iPad mini gets a major update with A17 Pro, delivering incredible performance and power efficiency in an ultraportable design. A17 Pro is a powerful chip that unlocks a number of improvements over A15 Bionic in the previous-generation iPad mini. With a 6-core CPU — two performance cores and four efficiency cores — A17 Pro delivers a 30 percent boost in CPU performance.<sup>1</sup> A17 Pro also brings a boost in graphics performance with a 5-core GPU, delivering a 25 percent jump over the previous generation.<sup>1</sup> A17 Pro brings entirely new experiences — including pro apps used by designers, pilots, doctors, and others — and makes it faster than ever for users to edit photos, dive into more immersive AR applications, and more. The new iPad mini brings true-to-life gaming with hardware-accelerated ray tracing — which is 4x faster than software-based ray tracing — as well as support for Dynamic Caching and hardware-accelerated mesh shading. From creating engaging content faster than ever in Affinity Designer, to playing demanding, graphics-intensive AAA games like Zenless Zone Zero, users can take the powerful performance and ultraportable iPad mini anywhere.

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/" target="_blank">Apple Pencil Pro</a> unlocks magical capabilities and powerful interactions, turning iPad mini into a sketchbook users can take anywhere. Apple Pencil Pro can sense a user’s squeeze, bringing up a tool palette to quickly switch tools, line weights, and colors, all without interrupting the creative process. A custom haptic engine delivers a light tap that provides confirmation when users squeeze, double-tap, or snap to a Smart Shape for a remarkably intuitive experience. Users can roll Apple Pencil Pro for precise control of the tool they’re using. Rotating the barrel changes the orientation of shaped pen and brush tools, just like pen and paper, and with Apple Pencil hover, users can visualize the exact orientation of a tool before making a mark. Apple Pencil Pro features support for Find My, and pairs, charges, and is stored through a new magnetic interface on the new iPad mini. iPad mini also supports Apple Pencil (USB-C), ideal for note taking, sketching, annotating, journaling, and more, at a great value.

<li>In the <strong>Notes </strong>app, handwritten notes become more fluid, flexible, and easy to read with <strong>Smart Script</strong> and the power of Apple Pencil. Smart Script unleashes powerful new capabilities for users editing handwritten text, allowing them to easily add space, or even paste typed text in their own handwriting. And as users write with Apple Pencil, their handwriting will be automatically refined in real time to be smoother, straighter, and more legible.</li>

                 <div><ul>
<li>New levels of customization come to iPad, and users have even more options to express themselves through the <strong>Home Screen</strong> with app icons and widgets that can be placed in any open position. App icons and widgets can take on a new look with a dark or tinted effect, and users can make them appear larger to create the experience that is perfect for them. <strong>Control Center </strong>has been redesigned to provide easier access to many of the things users do every day, delivering quick access to new groups of a user’s most-utilized controls. Users can even organize new controls from third-party apps in the redesigned Control Center.</li>

</figure><p>Put aside the hype about the growing number of us who are likely to make it to 100, because the rise in human life expectancy might actually be slowing down. At least, according to a study that analysed mortality data for ten countries or regions over the past three decades<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><p>“There are limits to how far out we can push out the envelope of human survival,” says study co-author S. Jay Olshansky, an epidemiologist at the University of Illinois Chicago. “If you live long enough, you run up against the biological process of ageing.”</p><p>The era of what he calls radical life extension is over, he argues. Some researchers, however, disagree and point out that medical science could yet find a way to push age limits.</p><p>Advances in public health and medicine during the twentieth century increased human life expectancy to about three years per decade. But Olshansky and others have long argued that this rate of improvement is not sustainable, despite more-optimistic forecasts that predict most children born in the twenty-first century would live for a 100 years or more<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>. But this is difficult to confirm, because the only way to be sure is to wait for enough people to die, or not.</p><p>With his colleagues, Olshansky first published the idea<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup> that human life expectancy has a finite limit in 1990. “We have waited 30 years to test this,” he says. “And we now have definitive evidence that the limited lifespan hypothesis is correct.”</p><p>That evidence is based on the numbers of reported deaths in parts of the world with some of the highest current life expectancies, including Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Australia, France, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, the United States and Spain. The analysis looked at the period of 1990 to 2019, to avoid the distorting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The team found that the rate of improvement in life expectancy in the decade of 2010–19 had dropped below that seen between 1990 and 2000. People were still living longer, but not by as much. In fact, in every population except those of Hong Kong and South Korea, the decadal rise in life expectancy decelerated to below two years.</p><p>Overall, the study found that children born since 2010 have a relatively small chance of living to 100 (5.1% chance for women and 1.8% chance for men). The most likely cohort to see a full century are women in Hong Kong, with a 12.8% chance.</p><h2>Can we overcome ageing?</h2><p>It’s clear that further extension of the average lifespan is difficult because that would require researchers to find treatments for illnesses that affect older people, says Dmitri Jdanov, a demographer at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany. Jdanov wrote, together with his colleague Domantas Jasilionis, an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00722-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00722-z" data-track-category="body text link">accompanying commentary on the paper</a>. Both articles are published in <i>Nature Aging</i> today.</p><p>But Jdanov thinks that Olshansky is too pessimistic about possible progress. “Although making another leap might be difficult, the rapid development of new technologies may lead to an unexpected health revolution,” he says.</p><p>A century ago, few researchers would have thought that child mortality could be reduced considerably, he says. But advances in vaccines, education and public health have since slashed the rate from more than 20% in 1950 to less than 4% now.</p><p>“If we cannot imagine something, it doesn’t mean that it’s impossible,” Jdanov says.</p><p>The study also revealed what Olshansky calls a “shocking” decline in the average life expectancy in the United States in the decade starting in 2010 — a trend seen in such a long-lived population only after extreme events, such as war, since 1900. The decline in the United States is driven by increasing numbers of deaths because of conditions such as diabetes and heart disease in people aged roughly 40 to 60.</p><p>“It tells you that something pretty negative is happening among some subgroups of the population to drag the average down, because the wealthier, more highly educated subgroups are actually doing better,” Olshansky says.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>One morning last November, the mathematician <a href="https://www.mat.uc.cl/~hector.pasten/">Hector Pasten</a> finally solved the problem that had been dogging him for more than a decade by using a time-tested productivity hack: procrastination.</p>
<p>He was supposed to be writing a final exam for his number theory class at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile in Santiago. To avoid the task, he started pondering, for the umpteenth time, one of his favorite sequences: 2, 5, 10, 17, 26 and so on, the list of all numbers of the form <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 1 (where <em>n</em> is a whole number).</p>
<p>Mathematicians have used this sequence for over a century to probe the fraught relationship between addition and multiplication, a tension that lies at the heart of number theory. Fundamental problems about multiplication — about, say, how numbers factor into primes — suddenly become much deeper and more challenging as soon as addition enters the picture. One of math’s biggest open questions, for example, asks whether every even number larger than 2 is the sum of two primes; another asks whether there are infinitely many pairs of primes <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-team-up-on-twin-primes-conjecture-20131119/">that differ by only 2</a>, such as 11 and 13.</p>
<p>The <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 1 sequence offers a good starting point for investigating the relationship between addition and multiplication, because it combines one of the simplest types of multiplication (squaring a number) with one of the simplest types of addition (adding 1). That doesn’t mean the sequence itself is simple. Mathematicians still can’t answer elementary questions about it, such as whether it contains infinitely many primes. “It doesn’t take far to get to the boundary of our knowledge,” said <a href="https://dms.umontreal.ca/~andrew/expository.php">Andrew Granville</a> of the University of Montreal. When mathematicians do manage to shift this boundary even a little, the techniques they develop often illuminate much broader questions about addition and multiplication.</p>
<p>Pasten was trying to show that the numbers in the sequence must always have at least one prime factor that is fairly large. On the morning when he should have been writing his final exam, he finally succeeded, by figuring out how to embed information about the prime factors of <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 1 in the structure of an equation called an elliptic curve.</p>
<p>Over lunch that day, he described his proof to his wife, the mathematician <a href="https://www.mat.uc.cl/~natalia.garcia/">Natalia Garcia-Fritz</a>. Given the surprising strength of his result, she “told me that I should probably check this many times,” Pasten said. “That afternoon I did so, and the theorems were still there.”</p>
</div>
    </div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>There was just one wrinkle: Pasten had no exam to give his students. He instead had them write an essay on whatever topic they wanted. “This turned out to result in very high-quality work,” he said.</p>
<p>Pasten submitted <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-024-01244-6">his proof</a> to <em>Inventiones Mathematicae</em>, one of math’s preeminent journals, where it was accepted in just over a month — the blink of an eye by the field’s usual publication standards. “It’s a lovely advance on something that hasn’t seen much progress for essentially 100 years,” said <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/pure-mathematics/cameron-stewart">Cameron Stewart</a> of the University of Waterloo. Mathematicians hope it will translate into advances on related number sequences, too.</p>
<p>Pasten’s technique also enabled him to make progress on certain cases of the <em>abc</em> conjecture, yet another question that deals with the interplay between addition and multiplication, and one of the most famous — and controversial — unsolved problems in mathematics. “New (and correct) ideas in this area have been scarce,” Granville wrote in an email. “The originality and promise of his methods deserve wide attention.”</p>
<h2><strong>Large Primes</strong></h2>
<p>If a sequence of numbers gets larger and larger, that’s no guarantee that their largest prime factors will do likewise. Take the sequence <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> — the numbers 1, 4, 9, 16 and so on. It’s easy to find numbers in this sequence whose prime factors are small. For example, any power of 2 on this list (4, 16, 64, 256, 1024 …) has only one prime factor: 2.</p>
<p>But when you add 1 to this sequence, “you completely destroy all the information you had” about prime factors, Pasten said. The “primes behave in a very wild way.”</p>
<p>In 1898, Carl Størmer <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02559599">proved that</a>, unlike in the <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> sequence, the largest prime factors of numbers in the <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 1 sequence approach infinity as <em>n</em> gets large. This finding showed that “something interesting is happening, something unusual,” Stewart said.</p>

<p>But Størmer couldn’t figure out how quickly the largest prime factors of <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 1 grow — a natural next step in characterizing the behavior of the sequence.</p>
<p>If you start calculating numbers in the sequence, most of them do seem to have at least one very large prime factor. But occasionally there’s a huge dip. For example, one number in the sequence, 586,034,187,508,450, has a prime factor of 67,749,617,053. But the largest prime factor of the next number in the sequence — 586,034,235,924,737 — is just 89. It’s these exceptions that make the problem hard.</p>
<p>In the mid-1930s, Sarvadaman Chowla and Kurt Mahler <a href="https://repository.ias.ac.in/8576/1/8576.pdf">independently</a> <a href="https://carmamaths.org/resources/mahler/docs/032.pdf">showed</a> that for any value of <em>n</em>, the largest prime factor of <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 1 must always be at least as large as about log(log <em>n</em>). But log(log <em>n</em>) grows incredibly slowly — if you graph it, it looks flat to the naked eye. Mathematicians suspected that the largest prime factor of <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 1 actually grows much more quickly. But they couldn’t prove it.</p>
<p>In 2001, Stewart and <a href="https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/~makryu/">Kunrui Yu</a> of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/duke-mathematical-journal/volume-108/issue-1/On-the-abc-conjecture-II/10.1215/S0012-7094-01-10815-6.short">developed a new approach</a> toward studying prime factors in sequences, using an area of mathematics called transcendence theory. Two years later, Julien Haristoy figured out how to apply their method to the <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 1 sequence, eking out a small improvement over Chowla and Mahler’s result.</p>
<p>But since then, the subject has been at an impasse. “We’ve needed a new ingredient for a long time,” Granville said.</p>
<h2><strong>Small Exponents</strong></h2>
<p>Pasten has been cultivating that new ingredient for more than a decade. In 2012, when he was a graduate student at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, his adviser, <a href="https://mast.queensu.ca/~murty/">Ram Murty</a>, suggested that he focus on problems that explore the interplay between addition and multiplication.</p>
<p>One of number theorists’ most potent tools for studying this interplay is to encode numbers into a type of equation called an elliptic curve. For instance, your numbers might appear as solutions to the equation, or in a related calculation called the discriminant. With the right encoding, mathematicians can tap into the rich structure of elliptic curves and make use of associated mathematical objects <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/behold-modular-forms-the-fifth-fundamental-operation-of-math-20230921/">known as modular forms</a>. “Whenever you can bring in those modular forms, for which there is a whole wonderful theory, it brings a lot of information,” said <a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~marc.hindry/home_uk.html">Marc Hindry</a> of Paris Cité University.</p>
<p>Over the years, Pasten developed a new theory involving modular forms and related entities called Shimura curves, which allowed him to tackle many of the questions Murty had given him. “But I was not able to make any progress on the <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 1 problem, absolutely nothing,” he said. “That bothered me for many years.”</p>

<p>On the November morning when Pasten was supposed to be writing his exam, the <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 1 problem represented escape in more ways than one. Earlier that year, his father had died, and Pasten found himself turning to math for comfort. “I found mathematics really helpful for that,” he said. “Mathematics is not just about proving theorems — it’s about a way to interact with reality, maybe.”</p>
<p>Getting direct control over the prime factors of the <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 1 sequence seemed too hard, so Pasten had long ago set his sights on a more indirect attack: getting control over the exponents in the prime factorization. If you’re factoring a large number, it might consist of small primes raised to large exponents, or large primes raised to small exponents. But it can’t consist of small primes raised to small exponents — that wouldn’t make a large enough number. So if you can show that the exponents are small, then at least one of the primes must be large, exactly what Pasten wanted to prove.</p>
<p>As Pasten stared at some calculations on his blackboard from the previous day, he suddenly realized that he might be able to control the exponents in the prime factorization of <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 1 by creating the right kind of elliptic curve. After some experimenting, he found one — the equation <em>y</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>x</em><sup>3</sup> + 3<em>x</em> + 2<em>n</em> — whose discriminant comes out to <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 1 times a factor of −108.</p>
<p>Applying his theory of Shimura curves to this particular elliptic curve, he could show that the product of the exponents of <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 1 must be fairly small. This didn’t necessarily mean that all the exponents must be small, but it gave him enough control over them to be able to bring in Stewart and Yu’s older method from transcendence theory. By using the two techniques together, he was able to prove that the largest prime factor of <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 1 must be at least about (log(log <em>n</em>))<sup>2</sup> — the square of the estimate Chowla and Mahler discovered in the 1930s. Pasten’s new growth rate is much higher than the previous record, though mathematicians suspect the true growth rate is higher still.</p>
<p>Even so, “it’s a remarkable improvement,” Hindry said.</p>
        
        
<p>Pasten was also able to use his techniques to improve estimates for certain cases of the <em>abc</em> conjecture, which says that if three whole numbers <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> and <em>c</em> (which share no prime factors) satisfy the equation <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> = <em>c</em>, then the product of their prime factors must be large compared to <em>c</em>. The conjecture, one of the most important in number theory, has been at the center of <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/titans-of-mathematics-clash-over-epic-proof-of-abc-conjecture-20180920/">a decade-long controversy</a>: The mathematician Shinichi Mochizuki claims to have proved it, but the majority of the mathematical community disagrees. Pasten’s work represents a completely different approach to the problem. While his result is far from a proof of the full conjecture, by some measures it represents the first significant progress in decades. “I feel the <em>abc</em> conjecture is a very stuck subject,” Granville said.</p>
<p>After Chowla and Mahler came up with their bound 90 years ago, mathematicians gradually established the same bound for an infinite family of related sequences, such as <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 3 or <em>n</em><sup>5</sup> + 2. Researchers will likely attempt the same with Pasten’s new bound, while also exploring the ramifications of his method for other problems at the interface of addition and multiplication. “The newness of the attack” makes this an exciting prospect, said <a href="https://sites.harvard.edu/barry-mazur/">Barry Mazur</a> of Harvard University.</p>
<p>Just what will emerge from those explorations is hard to foretell. “That’s the problem with originality,” Granville said. But “he’s definitely got something pretty cool.”</p>

<p dir="auto">Asterinas is a <em>secure</em>, <em>fast</em>, and <em>general-purpose</em> OS kernel
that provides <em>Linux-compatible</em> ABI.
It can serve as a seamless replacement for Linux
while enhancing <em>memory safety</em> and <em>developer friendliness</em>.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Asterinas prioritizes memory safety
by employing Rust as its sole programming language
and limiting the use of <em>unsafe Rust</em>
to a clearly defined and minimal Trusted Computing Base (TCB).
This innovative approach,
known as <a href="https://asterinas.github.io/book/kernel/the-framekernel-architecture.html" rel="nofollow">the framekernel architecture</a>,
establishes Asterinas as a more secure and dependable kernel option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Asterinas surpasses Linux in terms of developer friendliness.
It empowers kernel developers to
(1) utilize the more productive Rust programming language,
(2) leverage a purpose-built toolkit called <a href="https://asterinas.github.io/book/osdk/guide/index.html" rel="nofollow">OSDK</a> to streamline their workflows,
and (3) choose between releasing their kernel modules as open source
or keeping them proprietary,
thanks to the flexibility offered by <a href="#License">MPL</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">While the journey towards a production-grade OS kernel can be challenging,
we are steadfastly progressing towards our goal.
Currently, Asterinas only supports x86-64 VMs.
However, <a href="https://asterinas.github.io/book/kernel/roadmap.html" rel="nofollow">our aim for 2024</a> is
to make Asterinas production-ready on x86-64 VMs.</p>

<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/53112794" width="500" height="367" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
Music by F. Richard Moore. “The most fascinating use of the computer in filmmaking that I have seen recently is in L. Schwartz’ ALAE. Beginning with footage of sea birds in flight, the film image is then optically scanned and transformed by the computer. The geometric overlay on live random motion has the effect of creating new depth, a third dimension. Our perception of the birds’ forms and movements is heightened by the abstract pattern outlining them. Even if you suffer from the delusion that if you’ve seen one computer film, you’ve seen them all, give this stunning, original film a chance. Should you remain unconvinced, ALAE is a good example of the fact that computer technology seems destined to play an important role in animation.” – Jana Varlejs, Cine-Opsis, \f2Wilson Library Bull.\f1, March 1976. Whitney Museum of American Art.</p>

Music Symphony in D Major by Salieri. “As expert hands in the complex techniques of integrating the computer and animation, L. Schwartz makes fascinating use of exotic, flowing forms, colors and electronic music in ‘Metamorphosis’.” – A. H. Weiler, N. Y. Times. “Schwartz’ METAMORPHOSIS is a complex study of evolving lines, planes, and circles, all moving at different speeds, and resulting in subtle color changes. The only computer-generated work on the program, it transcends what many of us have come to expect of such film with its subtle variations and significant use of color.” – Catherine Egan, Sight Lines, Vol. 8, No. 4, Summer 1975.

<p>“Lines and rectangles are the geometric shapes basic to ENIGMA, a computer graphics film full of subliminal and persistent image effects. In a staccato rhythm, the film builds to a climax by instantly replacing one set of shapes with another, each set either changing in composition and color or remaining for a moment to vibrate strobiscopically and then change.” – The Booklist.

<p>Invented first 2D/3D Film without Pixel Shifting.</p>
<p>UFOs involved developing special color filters used on anoptical bench in reshooting original rolls, but to heighten the color saturation exponentially, black frames were inter-edited so that the eyes’ cones were constantly refreshed, the saturation never diminished, and there was a shift in the brain’s alpha rhythm so that observers had conflicting reations. A film breakthrough that literally created an individualized viewing experience.</p>
<p>Music by Emmanuel Ghent. “UFOs proves that computer animation–once a rickety and gimmicky device–is now progressing to the state of an art. The complexity of design and movement, the speed and rhythm, the richness of form and motion, coupled with stroboscopic effects is unsettling. Even more ominously, while design and action are programmed by humans, the ‘result’ in any particular sequence is neither entirely predictable … being created at a rate faster and in concatenations more complex than eye and mind can follow or initiate.” – Amos Vogel, Village Voice. Awards: Ann Arbor-1971; International award-Oberhausen, 1972; 2nd Los Angeles International Film Festival; Museum of Modern Art collection; Commissioned by AT&amp;T. Recent screening at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, December 10, 2012.</p>
<p><strong>1970 “PIXILLATION” – 4 Min.</strong></p>

<p>PIXILLATION occurred at a time when the computer system was linear in time and space; Programs did not yet control pixels as moving, malleable palettes so Lillian F. Schwartz only coded a few lines of computer-generated black and white texture that she intermixed with colored hand animation. She developed an editing technique so that colors between the two media were usually matched, but sometimes mismatched to permit the eye to see an even more saturated color arrangement. The film can be viewed in either 2D or 3D without pixel shifting although one must wear chroma-depth glasses.</p>
<p>“With computer-produced images and Moog-synthesized sound Pixillation is in a sense an introduction to the electronics lab. But its forms are always handsome, its colors bright and appealing, its rhythms complex and inventive.” – Roger Greenspun, N. Y. Times. Golden Eagle-Cine 1971. Moog sound by Gershon Kingsley; Version III: pulls the viewer into a primal experience. Awards:Red Ribbon Award for Special Effects from The National Academy of Television, Arts &amp; Sciences; The Smithsonian Institution and The United States Department of Commerce, Travel Services for Man &amp; His World at the Montreal Expo, ’71; collection The Museum of Modern Art. Commissioned by AT&amp;T. Recent screening at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, December 10, 2012.</p>
