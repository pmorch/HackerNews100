<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I've started working on a new edition of <a href="https://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope">Ruby Under a

<p>Here’s an excerpt from the completely new content for Chapter 4, about YJIT and
ZJIT. I’m still finishing this up… so this content is fresh off the page! It’s
been a lot of fun for me to learn about how JIT compilers work and to brush up
on my Rust skills as well. And it’s very exciting to see all the impressive work
the Ruby team at Shopify and other contributors have done to improve Ruby’s
runtime performance.</p>

<h2>Counting Method and Block Calls</h2>
<p>To find hot spots, YJIT counts how many times your program calls each function
or block. When this count reaches a certain threshold, YJIT stops your program
and converts that section of code into machine language. Later Ruby will execute
the machine language version instead of the original YARV instructions.</p>
<p>To keep track of these counts, YJIT saves an internal counter nearby the YARV
instruction sequence for each function or block.</p>
<p><img width="40%" src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2025/11/17/Figure-4-5.svg"><br>
<span>
Figure 4-5: YJIT saves information adjacent to each set of YARV instructions
</span>
</p>
<p>Figure 4-5 shows the YARV instruction sequence the main Ruby compiler created
for the <span>sum += i</span> block at (3) in Listing 4-1. At the
top, above the YARV instructions, Figure 4-5 shows two YJIT related values:
<span>jit_entry</span> and <span>jit_entry_calls</span>. As we’ll see in a moment, <span>jit_entry</span> starts as a null value but will later hold a
pointer to the machine language instructions YJIT produces for this Ruby block.
Below <span>jit_entry</span>, Figure 4-5 also shows <span>jit_entry_calls</span>, YJIT’s internal counter.</p>
<p>Each time the program in Listing 4-1 calls this block, YJIT increments the value
of <span>jit_entry_calls</span>. Since the range at (1) in Listing
4-1 spans from 1 through 40, this counter will start at zero and increase by 1
each time <span>Range#each</span> calls the block at (3).</p>
<p>When the <span>jit_entry_calls</span> reaches a particular
threshold, YJIT will compile the YARV instructions into machine language. By
default for small Ruby programs YJIT in Ruby 3.5 uses a threshold of 30. Larger
programs, like Ruby on Rails web applications, will use a larger threshold value
of 120. (You can also change the threshold by passing <span>—yjit-call-threshold</span> when you run your Ruby program.)</p>
<h2>YJIT Blocks</h2>
<p>While compiling your Ruby program, YJIT saves the machine language instructions
it creates into <em>YJIT blocks</em>. YJIT blocks, which are distinct from Ruby blocks,
each contain a sequence of machine language instructions for a range of
corresponding YARV instructions. By grouping YARV instructions and compiling
each group into a YJIT block, YJIT can produce more optimized code that is
tailored to your program’s behavior and avoid compiling code that your program
doesn’t need.</p>
<p>As we’ll see next, a single YJIT block doesn’t correspond to a Ruby function or
block. YJIT blocks instead represent smaller sections of code: individual YARV
instructions or a small range of YARV instructions. Each Ruby function or block
typically consists of several YJIT blocks.</p>
<p>Let’s see how this works for our example. After the program in Listing 4-1
executes the Ruby block at (3) 29 times, YJIT will increment the <span>jit_entry_calls</span> counter again, just before Ruby runs the
block for the 30th time. Since <span>jit_entry_calls</span> reaches
the threshold value of 30, YJIT triggers the compilation process.</p>
<p>YJIT compiles the first YARV instruction <span>getlocal_WC_1</span>
and saves machine language instructions that perform the same work as <span>getlocal_WC_1</span> into a new YJIT block:</p>
<p><img width="75%" src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2025/11/17/Figure-4-6.svg"><br>
<span>
Figure 4-6: Creating a YJIT block
</span>
</p>
<p>On the left side, Figure 4-6 shows the YARV instructions for the <span>sum += i</span> Ruby block. On the right, Figure 4-6 shows the new
YJIT block corresponding to <span>getlocal_WC_1</span>.</p>
<p>Next, the YJIT compiler continues and compiles the second YARV instruction from
the left side of Figure 4-7: <span>getlocal_WC_0</span> at index 2.</p>
<p><img width="75%" src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2025/11/17/Figure-4-7.svg"><br>
<span>
Figure 4-7: Appending to a YJIT block
</span>
</p>
<p>On the left side, Figure 4-7 shows the same YARV instructions for the <span>sum += i</span> Ruby block that we saw above in Figure 4-6. But now
the two dotted arrows indicate that the YJIT block on the right contains the
machine language instructions equivalent to both <span>getlocal_WC_1</span> and <span>getlocal_WC_0</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look inside this new block. YJIT compiles or translates the Ruby
YARV instructions into machine language instructions. In this example, running
on my Mac laptop, YJIT writes the following machine language instructions into
this new block:</p>
<p><img width="75%" src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2025/11/17/Figure-4-8.svg"><br>
<span>
Figure 4-8: The contents of one YJIT block
</span>
</p>
<p>Figure 4-8 shows a closer view of the new YJIT block that appeared on the right
side of Figures 4-6 and 4-7. Inside the block, Figure 4-8 shows the assembly
language acronyms corresponding to the ARM64 machine language instructions that
YJIT generated for the two YARV instructions shown on the left. The YARV
instructions on the left are: <span>getlocal_WC_1</span>, which
loads a value from a local variable located in the previous stack frame and
saves it on the YARV stack, and <span>getlocal_WC_0</span>, which
loads a local variable from the current stack from and also saves it on the YARV
stack. The machine language instructions on the right side of Figure 4-8 perform
the same task, loading these values into registers on my M1 microprocessor:
<span>x1</span> and <span>x9</span>. If you’re curious
and would like to learn more about what the machine language instructions mean
and how they work, the section “Adding Two Integers Using Machine Language”
discusses the instructions for this example in more detail.</p>
<h2>YJIT Branch Stubs</h2>
<p>Next, YJIT continues down the sequence of YARV instructions and compiles the
<span>opt_plus</span> YARV instruction at index 4 in Figures 4-6
and 4-7. But this time, YJIT runs into a problem: It doesn’t know the type of
the addition arguments. That is, will <span>opt_plus</span> add two
integers? Or two strings, floating point numbers, or some other types?</p>
<p>Machine language is very specific. To add two 64-bit integers on an M1
microprocessor, YJIT could use the <span>adds</span> assembly
language instruction. But adding two floating pointer numbers would require
different instructions. And, of course, adding or concatenating two strings is
an entirely different operation altogether.</p>
<p>In order for YJIT to know which machine language instructions to save into the
YJIT block for <span>opt_plus</span>, YJIT needs to know exactly
what type of values the Ruby program might ever add at (3) in Listing 4-1. You
and I can tell by reading Listing 4-1 that the Ruby code is adding integers. We
know right away that the <span>sum += 1</span> block at (3) is
always adding one integer to another. But YJIT doesn’t know this.</p>
<p>YJIT uses a clever trick to solve this problem. Instead of analyzing the entire
program ahead of time to determine all of the possible types of values the <span>opt_plus</span> YARV instruction might ever need to add, YJIT
simply waits until the block runs and observes which types the program actually
passes in.</p>
<p>YJIT uses <em>branch stubs</em> to achieve this wait-and-see compile behavior, as shown
in Figure 4-9.</p>
<p><img width="75%" src="https://patshaughnessy.net/assets/2025/11/17/Figure-4-9.svg"><br>
<span>
Figure 4-9: A YJIT block, branch and stub
</span>
</p>
<p>Figure 4-9 shows the YARV instructions on the left, and the YJIT block for
indexes 0000-0002 on the right. But note the bottom right corner of Figure 4-7,
which shows an arrow pointing down from the block to a box labeled stub. This
arrow represents a YJIT branch. Since this new branch doesn’t point to a block
yet, YJIT sets up the branch to point to a branch stub instead.</p>

Apart from the idea of showing enemies in a consistent colour, I like the choice of projections. Instead of opting for the classic projections seen in Western cartography, the authors of these maps choose projections that better balance the shape and size of different countries. They take advantage of the fact that only one region of the globe needs to be represented.</p><p>The encyclopaedia also includes maps of all the oceans, which also incorporate ocean current

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	   
<p><img alt="DDoS" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2025/06/12/DDoS-outage-map-globe.jpg" width="1600"></p>


<p>Microsoft said today that the Aisuru botnet hit its Azure network with a 15.72 terabits per second (Tbps) DDoS attack, launched from over 500,000 IP addresses.</p>


<p>The attack used extremely high-rate UDP floods that targeted a specific public IP address in Australia, reaching nearly 3.64 billion packets per second (bpps).</p>


<p>"The attack originated from Aisuru botnet. Aisuru is a Turbo Mirai-class IoT botnet that frequently causes record-breaking DDoS attacks by exploiting compromised home routers and cameras, mainly in residential ISPs in the United States and other countries," <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azureinfrastructureblog/defending-the-cloud-azure-neutralized-a-record-breaking-15-tbps-ddos-attack/4470422" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> Azure Security senior product marketing manager Sean Whalen.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wiz.io/lp/inside-mcp-security-a-research-guide-on-emerging-risks?utm_source=bleepingcomputer&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_campaign=FY26Q2_INB_FORM_MCP-Security-Research-Guide-Emerging-Risks&amp;sfcid=701Py00000PcNI9IAN&amp;utm_term=FY26Q4-bleepingcomputer-970x250&amp;utm_content=MCP-Security-Guide" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/c/w/wiz/MCP-Research-Guide-970x250.png" alt="Wiz"></a>
</p>


<p>"These sudden UDP bursts had minimal source spoofing and used random source ports, which helped simplify traceback and facilitated provider enforcement."</p>


<p>Cloudflare <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cloudflare-mitigates-new-record-breaking-222-tbps-ddos-attack/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">linked the same botnet</a> to a record-breaking 22.2 terabits per second (Tbps) DDoS attack that reached 10.6 billion packets per second (Bpps) and was mitigated in September 2025. This attack lasted only 40 seconds but was roughly equivalent to streaming one million 4K videos simultaneously.</p>


<p>One week earlier, the XLab research division of Chinese cybersecurity company Qi'anxin attributed another 11.5 Tbps DDoS attack to the <a href="https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/super-large-scale-botnet-aisuru-en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Aisuru botnet</a>, saying that it was controlling around 300,000 bots at the time.</p>


<p>The botnet targets security vulnerabilities in IP cameras, DVRs/NVRs, Realtek chips, and routers from T-Mobile, Zyxel, D-Link, and Linksys. As XLab researchers said, it suddenly ballooned in size in April 2025 after its operators breached a TotoLink router firmware update server and infected approximately 100,000 devices.</p>


<p>Infosec journalist Brian Krebs <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/cloudflare-scrubs-aisuru-botnet-from-top-domains-list/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> earlier this month that Cloudflare removed multiple domains linked to the Aisuru botnet from its public "Top Domains" rankings of the most frequently requested websites (based on DNS query volume) after they began overtaking legitimate sites, such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.</p>


<p>The company stated that Aisuru's operators were deliberately flooding Cloudflare's DNS service (1.1.1.1) with malicious query traffic to boost their domain's popularity while undermining trust in the rankings. Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince also confirmed that the botnet's behavior was severely distorting the ranking system and added that Cloudflare now redacts or completely hides suspected malicious domains to avoid similar incidents in the future.</p>


<p>​As Cloudflare revealed in its 2025 Q1 DDoS Report in April, it <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cloudflare-mitigates-record-number-of-ddos-attacks-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">mitigated a record number of DDoS attacks</a> last year, with a 198% quarter-over-quarter jump and a massive 358% year-over-year increase.</p>


<p>In total, it blocked 21.3 million DDoS attacks targeting its customers throughout 2024, as well as another 6.6 million attacks targeting its own infrastructure during an 18-day multi-vector campaign.</p>

Flock cameras are sold to the gullible and the complicit as simple “license plate readers.” Flock cameras are designed to watch cars. For safety, of course. Because crime. But they are much more. </span></p><p><span>The theory is </span><a href="https://www.govtech.com/biz/flock-safety-gives-users-expanded-vehicle-location-abilities" rel="">this</a><span>: </span></p><blockquote><p>Flock Safety, a fast-growing startup that helps law enforcement find vehicles from fixed cameras, has released a slew of new features meant to make it easier for users to locate vehicles of interest.</p><p>Overall, the moves push the company’s software in the direction of giving police the ability to search for vehicles using whatever cameras are at their disposal — a security camera at an ATM, a homeowner’s Ring doorbell, even a photo somebody took on their cellphone. The company’s new Advanced Search package — which costs between $2,500 and $5,000 a year, depending on how many of Flock Safety’s cameras the agency operates — includes a feature that allows users to upload a picture of a vehicle from any source and then perform a search to see if any of the company’s cameras have seen it.</p><p>It doesn’t just search for license plates, either. The company has designed its software to recognize vehicle features such as paint color, type of vehicle and distinguishing features such as roof racks.</p></blockquote><p><span>The tell is in the name: Flock </span><em>Safety</em><span>. Because “keeping you safe” is the reason for every intrusion. As one police-oriented site </span><a href="https://solutions.lpresearch.org/listing/flock-cameras/" rel="">puts it</a><span> (note: “you” here is the cops):</span></p><blockquote><p>7/10 crimes are committed with the use of a vehicle. Capture the vehicle details you need to track leads and solve crime. Flock Safety’s patented Vehicle Fingerprint™ technology lets you search by vehicle make, color, type, license plate, state of the license plate, missing plate, covered plate, paper plate, and unique vehicle details like roof racks, bumper stickers, and more.</p></blockquote><p>The reach is stunning in breadth. Flock captures everything it sees. Everything. Not just vehicles. People. Everything. </p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://neuburger.substack.com/p/cities-panic-over-having-to-release?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://neuburger.substack.com/p/cities-panic-over-having-to-release?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>Think that’s a problem? So does a Washington state judge, who ruled that the sweep is so great that </span><a href="https://www.newsbreak.com/share/4340028007520-a-judge-s-decision-just-made-cities-panic-over-what-their-cameras-recorded" rel="">its data is a public record</a><span>. Public means open to all. </span></p><p>That freaked out so many towns that the company is starting to lose contracts.</p><blockquote><p><span>Across the United States, thousands of automated license plate readers quietly watch the roads. Some ride along in </span><a href="https://www.carscoops.com/2025/10/police-run-over-biker-high-speed-chase-video/" rel="">police cruisers</a><span> </span><em>[note: unrelated link, but a helluva story]</em><span>, others perch on telephone poles or hang above intersections, clicking away as cars glide past. They record everything in sight, regardless of who’s behind the wheel.</span></p><p>It’s a vast, largely invisible network, one that most people never think twice about until it makes the news.</p><p>Well, it turns out that those pictures are public data, according to a judge’s recent ruling. And almost as soon as the decision landed, local officials scrambled to shut the cameras down.</p></blockquote><p>The tale behind the case is interesting:</p><blockquote><p>The ruling stems from a civil case involving the Washington cities of Sedro-Woolley and Stanwood. Both sued to block public records requests filed by Oregon resident Jose Rodriguez. He works in Walla Walla and sought to access the images as part of a broader inquiry into government surveillance.</p><p>Judge Elizabeth Yost Neidzwski sided with Rodriguez, concluding that the data “do qualify as public records subject to the Public Records Act.”</p><p>The decision immediately led both cities to deactivate their Flock systems. Flock cameras are mounted along public roadways and continuously photograph passing vehicles, including occupants, regardless of whether any crime is suspected.</p></blockquote><p><span>Concerns about privacy are central to the case. City attorneys, defending against Rodriguez’s suit, said releasing the data would compromise the privacy of innocents. But they saw no problem with the </span><em>government</em><span> keeping the same data. </span></p><p><span>This gets us to the central problem of today’s surveillance state. No one running the cameras wants to be observed. One reason that city officials object to releasing Flock data, for example, must that they themselves are among the recorded. The cameras are on them too; they too can be tracked. Everything means </span><em>everything</em><span> for these everywhere cameras. </span></p><p>The rich want to hide their crimes (hello, Mr. Epstein’s friends). ICE wants to mask its thugs. Billionaires think you have no business in their affairs.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8U-W!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d738343-b816-4fce-abe0-ce844aeac737_784x900.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8U-W!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d738343-b816-4fce-abe0-ce844aeac737_784x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8U-W!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d738343-b816-4fce-abe0-ce844aeac737_784x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8U-W!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d738343-b816-4fce-abe0-ce844aeac737_784x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8U-W!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d738343-b816-4fce-abe0-ce844aeac737_784x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8U-W!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d738343-b816-4fce-abe0-ce844aeac737_784x900.jpeg" width="784" height="900" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3d738343-b816-4fce-abe0-ce844aeac737_784x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:900,&quot;width&quot;:784,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Five individuals wearing dark clothing and black masks covering their faces stand on a sidewalk.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="single-article-content">

                        <p>For years, Samsung has shipped its Galaxy M, F, and A series smartphones in India with a little-known app called <strong>AppCloud</strong>. Despite its name, AppCloud isn’t a cloud storage service. It’s essentially an app-installer that surfaces third-party app recommendations during device setup.
</p><div>
<p>On new Galaxy devices in these lineups, AppCloud appears as part of the initial onboarding and forces users to choose whether they want to install certain apps before setup can be completed. You can postpone this by choosing the “later” option, but the app continues to push a persistent notification until you finish the selection process or disable it entirely. </p>
</div><p>For most users, AppCloud has long been regarded as little more than nuisance bloatware, a side effect of Samsung’s need to generate revenue beyond hardware margins while competing with aggressive Chinese smartphone brands in India.<!-- Either there are no banners, they are disabled or none qualified for this location! -->
</p><p>But findings by the non-profit SMEX <a href="https://smex.org/invasive-israeli-software-is-harvesting-data-from-samsung-users-in-wana/?s=09">from earlier this year</a> suggest AppCloud may not be as harmless as once assumed.
</p><p>
<h3 id="h-appcloud-expansion-into-asian-and-african-markets-has-sparked-scrutiny"><strong>AppCloud expansion into Asian and African markets has sparked scrutiny</strong></h3>
</p><p>Since 2022, Samsung has also been preloading AppCloud on its A and M series phones in several West Asian and North African (WANA) markets. This rollout has triggered privacy concerns due to AppCloud’s ties to ironSource, a company founded in Israel and now owned by US-based Unity.
</p><p>While AppCloud can be disabled, it is difficult to remove without root access. Furthermore, its privacy policy is not easily available online, raising questions about transparency, user consent, and what kind of data the app may collect.<!-- Either there are no banners, they are disabled or none qualified for this location! -->
</p><p>ironSource itself has a controversial track record. The company previously operated an “InstallCore” program that became infamous for installing software without clear user permission and for bypassing security warnings, behavior that resulted in widespread criticism and blacklisting by several anti-malware tools.
</p><p>
<h3 id="h-regional-sensitivities-make-things-more-contentious"><strong>Regional sensitivities make things more contentious</strong></h3>
</p><p>The presence of an Israeli-origin technology component on Samsung phones in WANA countries poses additional problems. Several nations in this region legally bar Israeli companies from operating, and in light of the ongoing Israel–Palestine conflict, the preload of an app tied to such a company becomes even more contentious.<!-- Either there are no banners, they are disabled or none qualified for this location! -->
</p><p>ironSource’s Aura technology, which “optimizes device experiences” by surfacing apps, content, and services directly on smartphones, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/ironsource-expands-samsung-partnership-launching-on-samsung-mobile-devices-in-mena">has been used on Samsung devices</a> in Europe, Russia, and Southeast Asia, and by telecom operators in the US; it also appears to do something similar to AppCloud. However, <strong>AppCloud itself is not listed anywhere on ironSource’s website</strong>, which appears to be the major cause for concern, even though the app is now owned by a US company.
</p><p>While there’s no concrete evidence that AppCloud engages in questionable data practices today, the lack of an accessible privacy policy and ironSource's past reputation are causing anxiety among users.
</p><p>
<h3 id="h-people-want-samsung-to-respond"><strong>People want Samsung to respond</strong></h3>
</p><p>Consumer advocates and privacy-focused users are urging Samsung to take immediate steps, like providing a clear opt-out for AppCloud during setup, making its privacy policy public and accessible, and to stop preloading the app entirely in sensitive regions.
</p><p>With concerns rising across multiple markets, Samsung will likely need to issue a statement to reassure customers. We have reached out to the company for comment and will update this story once we hear back.

	<p>Gemini is a new internet technology supporting an electronic library of interconnected text documents.  That's not a new idea, but it's not old fashioned either.  It's timeless, and deserves tools which treat it as a first class concept, not a vestigial corner case.  Gemini isn't about innovation or disruption, it's about providing some respite for those who feel the internet has been disrupted enough already.  We're not out to change the world or destroy other technologies.  We are out to build a lightweight online space where documents are just documents, in the interests of every reader's privacy, attention and bandwidth.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article class="page" lang="en">







<section id="pagebody" role="main">
<p>I wrote a few months ago about <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/google-killing-open-web/">the proxy war by Google against the open web by means of XSLT</a>.
Unsurprisingly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a> <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/deprecating-xslt" title="Deprecating and removing XSLT in the browser">has been moving forward on the deprecation</a>,
still without providing a solid justification on the reasons why other than
“we've been leeching off a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOSS">FLOSS</a> library for which we've finally found enough security bugs to use as an excuse”.
They do not explain why they haven't decided to fix the security issues in the library instead,
or adopt a more modern library written in a safe language, taking the opportunity to upgrade <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/XSLT/" rel="tag">XSLT</a> support
to a more recent, powerful and easier-to-use revision of the standard.</p>

<p>Instead, what they do is to provide a “polyfill”, a piece of <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/javascript/" rel="tag">JavaScript</a> that can allegedly used to supplant the functionality.
Curiously, however, they do <em>not</em> plan to ship such alternative in-browser,
which would allow a transparent transition without even a need to talk about XSLT <em>at all</em>.
No, they specifically refuse to do it, and instead are requesting anyone still relying on XSLT to
replace the invocation of the XSLT with a <em>non-standard</em> invocation of the JavaScript polyfill that should replace it.</p>

<p>This means that at least one of these two things are true:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the polyfill is not, in fact, sufficient to cover all the use cases previously covered by the built-in support for XSLT,
and insofar as it's not, they (Google) do not intend to invest resources in maintaining it,
meaning that the task is being dumped on web developers
(<abbr title="In Other Words">IOW</abbr>, Google is removing a feature that is going to create
<em>more work</em> for web developers just to provide the same functionality that they used to have from the browsers);</p></li>
<li><p>insofar as the polyfill is sufficient to replace the XSLT support in the browser,
the policy to not ship it as a replacement confirms that the security issues in the XSLT library used in Chrome
were nothing more than excuses to give the final blow to <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/rss/" rel="tag">RSS</a> and any other <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/XML/" rel="tag">XML</a> format
that is still the backbone of an independent web.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As I have mentioned <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/deprecating-xslt" title="DO NOT COMPLY.">in the Fediverse thread I wrote before this long-form article</a>,
there's an obvious parallel here with the events that I already mentioned
<a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/google-killing-open-web/">in my previous article</a>:
when <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/mozilla/" rel="tag">Mozilla</a> bent over to <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/google/" rel="tag">Google</a>'s pressure to kill off RSS by removing the “Live Bookmarks” features from the browser,
they did this on presumed technical grounds (citing as usual <a href="https://www.gijsk.com/blog/2018/10/firefox-removes-core-product-support-for-rss-atom-feeds/" title="Firefox removes core product support for RSS/Atom feeds">security and maintenance costs</a>,
but despite paid lip service to their importance for an open and interoperable web,
they didn't provide any official replacement for the functionality,
directing users instead to <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/feed-reader-replacements-firefox" title="Feed reader replacements for Firefox">a number of add-ons that provided similar functionality</a>,
<em>none of which are written or supported by Mozilla</em>.
Compare and contrast with their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket%20%28service%29">Pocket</a> integration that they force-installed everywhere
<a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/future-of-pocket" title="Pocket has shut down - What you need to know">before ultimately killing the service</a></p>

<p>Actions, as they say, speak louder than words.
When a company claims that a service or feature they are removing can be still accessed by other means,
but do not streamline such access said alternative,
and instead require their users to do the work necessary to access it,
you can rest assured that beyond any word of support they may coat their actions with
there is a plain and direct intent at sabotaging said feature,
and you can rest assured that any of the excuses brought forward to defend the choice
are nothing but lies to cover a vested interest in sabotaging the adoption of the service or feature:
the intent is for you to <em>not</em> use that feature at all, because they have a financial interest in you <em>not</em> using it.</p>

<p>And the best defense against that is to attack, and push the use of that feature even harder.</p>

<h2 id="do.not.comply."><a name="index1h2"></a>Do. Not. Comply.</h2>

<p>This is the gist of <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/deprecating-xslt" title="DO NOT COMPLY.">my Fediverse thread</a>.</p>

<p>
Do not install the polyfill.
Do not change your XML files to load it.
Instead, flood their issue tracker with requests to bring back in-browser XSLT support.
Report failed support for XSLT as a broken in browsers, because this is not a website issue.
</p>

<p><strong>I will not comply.</strong>
As I have for <em>years</em> continued using <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/mathml/" rel="tag">MathML</a>, <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/svg/" rel="tag">SVG</a> and <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/smil/" rel="tag">SMIL</a>
(sometimes <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/ars/halving-series/">even all together</a>) despite Google's intent on their deprecation,
I will keep using XSLT, and in fact will look for new opportunities to rely on it.
At most, I'll set up an infobox warning users reading my site about their browser's potential brokenness
and inability to follow standards, just like I've done for MathML and SMIL
(you can see such infoboxes in the page I linked above).
And just like ultimately I was proven right
(after several years, Google ended up fixing both their SMIL and their MathML support in Chrome),
my expectation is that, particularly with more of us pushing through,
the standards will once again prevail.</p>

<p>Remember: there is not technical justification for Google's choice.
This is not about a lone free software developer donating their free time to the community
and finding they do not have the mental or financial resources to provide a particular feature.
This is a trillion-dollar ad company who has been actively destroying the open web
for over a decade <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/773928/google-open-web-rapid-decline" title="Google admits the open web is in ‘rapid decline’">and finally admitting to it</a>
as a consequence of the <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr> push
and <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-men-who-killed-google/" title="The man who killed Google Search">intentional</a> [enshittification of web search]<a href="https://www.404media.co/google-search-really-has-gotten-worse-researchers-find/" title="Google Search Really Has Gotten Worse, Researchers Find">404mediaSearch</a>.</p>

<p>The deprecation of XSLT is entirely political,
fitting within the same grand scheme of the parasitic corporation killing the foundations of its own success
in an effort to grasp more and more control of it.
And the fact that the <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/webkit/" rel="tag">WebKit</a> team at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple%20Inc%2E">Apple</a>
and the <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/firefox/" rel="tag">Firefox</a> team at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla">Mozilla</a>
are intentioned to follow along on the same destructive path is not a counterpoint,
but rather an endorsement of the analysis,
as neither of those companies is interested in providing a <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/not-your-pc/">User Agent</a>
<span id="surveillance">as much as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surveillance%20capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a> tool that you happen to use.</span></p>

<p>(Hence why Mozilla, a company allegedly starved for resources,
is wasting them implementing <a href="https://flamedfury.com/posts/disable-ai-in-firefox/">LLM features nobody wants</a>
instead of <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=155730">fixing much-voted decade-old bugs with several duplicates</a>.
Notice how the bug pertains the (mis)treatment of XML-based formats —like RSS.)</p>

<p>If you have to spend any time at all to confront the Chrome push to deprecate XSLT,
your time is much better spent inventing better uses of XSLT
and reporting broken rendering if/when they start disabling it,
than caving to their destructive requests.</p>

<h2 id="thewhatwgisnotagoodstewardoftheopenweb"><a name="index2h2"></a>The WHATWG is not a good steward of the open web</h2>

<p>I've mentioned it <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/google-killing-open-web/">before</a>,
but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHATWG">WHATWG</a>, even assuming the best of intentions at the time it was founded,
is not a good steward of the open web.
It is more akin to the corrupt takeover you see in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regulatory%20capture">regulatory capture</a>,
except that instead of taking over the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C">W3C</a>
they just decided to get the ball and run with it,
taking advantage of the fact that, as implementors,
they had the final say on what counted as “standard”
(<em lang="lat">de facto</em> if not <em lang="lat">de jure</em>):
exactly the same attitude with which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> tried taking over the web
through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet%20Explorer">Internet Explorer</a> at the time of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First%20browser%20war">First browser war</a>,
an attitude that was rightly condemned at the time
—even as many of those who did, have so far failed to acknowledge the problem
with Google's no less detrimental approach.</p>

<p>The key point here is that,
whatever the <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/WHATWG/" rel="tag">WHATWG</a> was (or was intended to be)
when it was founded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera%20%28company%29">Opera</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla">Mozilla</a> developers,
it is now manifestly a corporate monster.
Their corporate stakeholder have a very different vision of what the Web should be
compared to the vision on which the Web was founded, the vision promoted by the <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/W3C/" rel="tag">W3C</a>,
and the vision that underlies a truly open and independent web.</p>

<p>The WHATWG aim is to turn the Web into an <em>application delivery platform</em>,
a profit-making machine for corporations where the computer
(and the browser through it)
are a means for <em>them</em> to make money off <em>you</em>
rather than for <em>you</em> to gain access to services you may be interested in.
Because of this, the browser in their vision is not a User Agent anymore,
but a tool that sacrifices privacy, actual security and user control
at the behest of the corporations “on the other side of the wire”
—and of their political interests
(refs. for <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/03/tim-cook-apple-donate-1-million-trump-inauguration" title="Scoop: Apple CEO Tim Cook donates $1 million to Trump inauguration">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/09/congress/google-donation-donald-trump-inauguration-00197233" title="Google gives $1 million to Trump inauguration">Google</a>,
and <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/ballroom-donors-white-house-trump" title="White House releases list of donors for Trump’s multi-million-dollar ballroom">a more recent list with all of them together</a>).</p>

<p>Such vision is in direct contrast with that of the Web as a
<em>repository of knowledge</em>, a vast vault of interconnected <em>documents</em>
whose value emerges from organic connections, personalization,
variety, curation and <em>user control</em>.
But who in the WHATWG today would defend such vision?</p>

<h2 id="anewbrowserwar"><a name="index3h2"></a>A new browser war?</h2>

<p>Maybe what we need is a new browser war.
Not one of corporation versus corporation
—doubly more so when all currently involved parties are allied
in their efforts to enclose the Web than in fostering an open and independent one—
but one of users versus corporations,
a war to take <em>back</em> control of the Web and its tools.</p>

<p>It's kind of ironic that in a time when <em>hosting</em> has become almost trivial,
the fight we're going to have to fight is going to be on the <em>client</em> side.
But the biggest question is: who do we have as champions on our side?</p>

<p>I would have liked to see browsers like <a href="https://vivaldi.net/">Vivaldi</a>,
the spiritual successor to <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/opera-requiem/">my beloved classic Opera browser</a>,
amongst our ranks,
but with their dependency on the <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tag/blink/" rel="tag">Blink</a> rendering engine, controlled by Google,
they won't be able to do anything but cave,
as will all other FLOSS browsers relying on Google's or Apple's engines,
none of which I foresee spending any significant efforts rolling back the extensive changes that these deprecations will involve.
(We see this already when it comes to JPEG&nbsp;XL support,
but it's also true that e.g. Vivaldi has made RSS feeds first-class documents,
so who knows, maybe they'll find a way for XSLT through the polyfill that was mentioned above,
or something like that?)</p>

<p>Who else is there?
There is <a href="https://servo.org/">Servo</a>, the rendering engine that was being developed at Mozilla to replace Gecko,
and that turned into an independent project when its team was fired <em lang="lat">en masse</em> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/mozilla-cutting-250-jobs-after-coronavirus-pandemic-cuts-revenue/">in 2020</a>;
but they don't support XSLT yet,
and I don't see why they would prioritize its implementation over, say, stuff like MathML or SVG animations with SMIL
(just to name two of my pet peeves), or optimizing browsing speed
(seriously, try opening <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/">the home page of this site</a> and scrolling through).</p>

<p>What we're left with at the moment is basically just Firefox forks,
and two of these (<a href="https://librewolf.net/">LibreWolf</a> and <a href="https://waterfox.net/">WaterFox</a>)
are basically just “Firefox without the most egregious privacy-invasive misfeatures”,
which leaves the question open about what they will be willing to do when Mozilla helps Google kill XSLT,
and only the other one, <a href="https://palemoon.org/">Pale&nbsp;Moon</a>, has grown into its own independent fork
(since such an old version of Firefox, in fact, that it doesn't support WebExtensions-based plugins,
such as the most recent versions of crucial plugins like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uBlock%20Origin">uBlock Origin</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy%20Badger">Privacy Badger</a>,
although it's possible to install community-supported forks of these plugins designed
for legacy versions of Firefox and forks like Pale&nbsp;Moon).</p>

<p>(Yes, I am aware that there are other minor independent browser projects,
like <a href="https://dillo-browser.github.io/">Dillo</a> and <a href="https://ladybird.org/">Ladybird</a>,
but the former is in no shape of being a serious contender for general use
on more sophisticated pages —just see it in action on this site, as always—
and the latter is not even in alpha phase,
just in case the questionable “no politics” policies
—which consistently prove to be weasel words for “we're right-wingers but too chicken to come out as such”—
weren't enough to stay away from it.)</p>

<p>Periodically, I go through them (the Firefox forks, that is) to check if they are good enough for me to become my daily drivers.
Just for you (not really: just for me, actually), I just tested them again.
They're not ready yet, at least not for me, although I must say that I'm seeing clear improvements since my last foray into the matter,
that wasn't even that long ago.
In some cases, I can attest that they are even better than Firefox:
for example, Pale&nbsp;Moon and WaterFox have good JPEG&nbsp;XL support
(including transparency and animation support,
which break in LibreWolf as they do in the latest nightly version of Firefox I tried),
and Pale&nbsp;Moon still has first-class support for RSS,
from address bar indicator to rendering even in the absence of a stylesheet
(be it CSS or XSLT).</p>

<p>(A suggestion? Look into more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/microformats">microformats</a> support.
An auxiliary bar with previous/<wbr>next/<wbr>up links on pages where this is relevant
would be a nice touch, for example.
<a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/opera-requiem-3/">It's one of those little details that really made classic Opera shine</a>.
EDIT: I <a href="https://pleroma.envs.net/objects/3bafa2dc-9621-4f13-a8f2-89fd000ba862">just found out</a>
that there's <a href="https://addons.palemoon.org/addon/website-navigation-bar/">a relevant addon</a> for Pale Moon!)</p>

<p>An interesting difference is that the user interface of these browsers is perceivably less refined than Firefox'.
It's a bit surprising, given the common roots,
but it emerges in several more and less apparent details,
from the spacing between menu items to overlapping text and icons in context menus,
passing through incomplete support for dark themes and other little details that all add up,
giving these otherwise quite valid browsers and amateurish feeling.</p>

<p>And I get it: UI design is hard, and I myself suck at it, so I'm the last person that should be giving recommendations,
but I'm still able to differentiate between more curated interfaces and ones that need some work;
and if even someone like me who distinctly prefers function over form finds these little details annoying,
I can imagine how much worse this may feel to users who care less about the former and more about the latter.
Sadly, if a new browser war is to be fought to wrestle control from the corporate-controlled WHATWG,
<em>this matters</em>.</p>

<p>In the end, I find myself in a “waiting” position.
How long will it take for Firefox to kill their XSLT support?
What will its closest forks
(WaterFox in particular is the one I'm eyeing)
be able to do about it?
Or will Pale&nbsp;Moon remain the only modern broser with support for it,
as a hard fork that has since long gone its own way?
Will they have matured enough to become my primary browsers?
We'll see in time.</p>

<h2 id="gemini"><a name="index4h2"></a>Another web?</h2>

<p>There's more to the Internet than the World Wide Web built around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">HTTP</a> protocol and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> file format.
There used to be <em>a lot</em> of the Internet beyond the Web,
and while much of it still remains as little more than a shadow of the past,
largely eclipsed by the Web and what has been built on top of it
(not all of it good) outside of some modest revivals,
there's also new parts of it that have tried to learn from the past,
and build towards something different.</p>

<p>This is the case for example of the so-called “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini%20%28protocol%29">Gemini</a> Space”,
a small corner of the Internet that has nothing to do with the LLM Google is trying to shove down everyone's throat,
and in fact not only predates it, <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/google-killing-open-web/">as I've mentioned already</a>,
but is intentionally built around dfferent technology to <em>stay away</em> from the influence of Google and the like.</p>

<p>The Gemini protocol is designed to be conceptually simpler than HTTP,
while providing modern features like built-in transport-level security
and certificate-based client-side authentication,
and its own “native” document format, the so-called <a href="https://geminiprotocol.net/docs/gemtext-specification.gmi" title="Gemini hypertext format, aka 'gemtext', specification">gemtext</a>.</p>

<p>As I said in <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/deprecating-xslt" title="DO NOT COMPLY.">my aforementioned Fediverse thread</a>:</p>

<p>
There's something to be said about not wanting to share your environment with the poison that a large part of the web has become,
but at the same time, there's also something to be said about throwing away the baby with the bathwater.
The problem with the web isn't technical, it's social. The tech itself is fine.
</p>

<p>I'm not going to write up an extensive criticism of the Gemini Space:
you can <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2023/05/28/the-gemini-protocol-seen-by-this-http-client-person/" title="The Gemini protocol seen by this HTTP client person">find here an older opinion</a> by the author of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl%20%28software%29"><code>curl</code></a>,
(although it should be kept in mind that things have changed quite a bit since:
for example, <a href="https://geminiprotocol.net/docs/" title="Gemini protocol documentation">the specification of the different components has been separated</a>,
as suggested by Daniel),
and <a href="https://aartaka.me/gmi-a11y.html" title="Gemtext Is Not Accessible">some criticism about how gemtext is used</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not going to sing the praises of the Gemini protocol or gemtext either,
even though I do like the idea of a web built on lightweight markup formats:
I would love it if browsers had native support for formats like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc">AsciiDoc</a> (and gemtext, for the matter):
it's why I keep the <a href="https://docs.asciidoctor.org/browser-extension/" title="Asciidoctor Browser Extension Documentation">AsciiDoctor Browser Extension</a> installed.</p>

<p>But more in general, the Web (or at least its user agents) should not differentiate.
It should not differentiate by protocol, and it should not differentiate by format.
We've seen it with image formats like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNG">MNG</a> being unfairly excluded,
with [motivations based on alleged code bloat][nomng] that today are manifest in their idiocy
(and yes, it hasn't escaped my that even Pale&nbsp;Moon doesn't support the format),
and we're seeing it today with JPEG&nbsp;XL threatened with a similar fate,
without even gracing us with a ridiculous excuse.
On the upside, we have browsers shipping with <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/">a full-fledged PDF reader</a>,
which is a good step towards the integration of this format with the greater Web.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, browsers would have not deprecated older protocols
like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher%20%28protocol%29">Gopher</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTP">FTP</a>,
and would just add support for new ones like Gemini,
as they would have introduced support for new (open) document formats as they came along.</p>

<p>(<a name="flash">Why insist on the <em>open</em> part?</a>
In <a href="https://mastodon.social/@whitequark/115509662529186486">another Fediverse thread about the XSLT deprecation</a>
I had an interesting discussion with the <abbr title="Original Poster">OP</abbr> about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWF">SWF</a>,
<em>the</em> interactive multimedia format for the Web at the turn of the century.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe%20Flash%20Player">Adobe Flash Player</a> ultimately fell out of favour,
arguably due to the advent of mobile Internet:
it has been argued that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash#End_of_life" title="Adobe Flash - End of life">the iPhone killed Flash</a>,
and while there's some well-deserved criticism of hypocrisy levelled against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve%20Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughts%20on%20Flash">Thoughts on Flash</a> letter,
it <em>is</em> true that what ultimatelly <em>truly</em> killed the format was it being proprietary and not fully documented.
And while we might not want to cry about the death of a proprietary format,
it remains true even today that the loss of even just legacy suport for it
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@whitequark/115512475517697743" title="flash was way more valuable to culture and art than xslt is ever going to be.">has been a significant loss to culture and art</a>,
as argued by <a href="https://mastodon.social/@whitequark">@whiteshark​@mastodon.social</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="awebofinterconnectedsoftware"><a name="index5h2"></a>A Web of interconnected software?</h2>

<p>It shouldn't be up to the User Agent to determine which formats the user is able to access, and through which protocol.
(If I had any artistic prowess (and willpower), I'd hack the “myth of consensual X” meme
representing the user and the server saying “I consent”, and the browser saying “I don't”.)
I do appreciate that there is a non-trivial maintenance cost that grows with the number of formats and protocols,
but <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/opera-requiem-2/">we know from classic Opera</a> that it is indeed quite possible
to <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/opera-requiem-3/">ship a full Internet suite</a> in a browser packaging.</p>

<p>In the old days, browser developers were well-aware that a single vendor couldn't “cover all bases”,
which is how interfaces like the once ubiquituous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPAPI">NPAPI</a> were born.
The plug-in interface has been since removed from most browsers,
an initiative <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/npapi-deprecation/" title="NPAPI deprecation: developer guide">again promoted by Google</a>, announced in 2013 and completed in 2015
(I should really add this to <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/google-killing-open-web/">my previous post on Google killing the open web</a>,
but I also really don't feel like touching that anymore; here will have to suffice),
with the other major browsers quickly following suit,
and its support is now relegated only to independent browsers like Pale&nbsp;Moon.</p>

<p>And even if it can be argued that the NPAPI specifically was indeed mired with unfixable security and portability issues and it had to go,
its removal without a clear cross-browser upgrade path has been <a name="pluginevolution">a significant loss for the evolution of the web</a>,
destroying the primary “escape hatch” to solve the chicken-and-egg problem of client-side format support versus server-side format adoption.
By the way, it was also responsible for the biggest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C">W3C</a> blunder,
the standardization of <abbr title="Digital Restriction Management">DRM</abbr> for the web through the so-called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encrypted%20Media%20Extensions">Encrypted Media Extensions</a>, a betrayal of the W3C own mission statement.</p>

<h3 id="theroleofmultimediastreaminginthedeathoftheuseragent"><a name="index1h3"></a>The role of multimedia streaming in the death of the User Agent</h3>

<p>The timeline here is quite interesting, and correlates with <a href="#flash">the already briefly mentioned history of Flash</a>,
and its short-lived <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft%20Silverlight">Microsoft Silverlight</a> competitor, that were largely responsible for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media#Business_developments">the early expansive growth of multimedia streaming services</a> in the early years of the XXI century:
with the tension between Apple's effort to kill Flash
and the need of emerging streaming services like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix">Netflix</a>' and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu">Hulu</a>'s
to support in-browser multimedia streaming,
there was a need to improve support for multimedia formats in the nascent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a> specification,
but also a requirement from the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/MAFIAA"><abbr title="Music And Film Industry Associations of America">MAFIAA</abbr></a> partners
that such a support would allow enforcing the necessary restrictions that would, among other things, prevent users from saving a local copy of the stream,
something that could be more easily enforced within the Flash players the industries had control over
than in a <em>User Agent</em> controlled by <em>the user</em>.</p>

<p>This is where the development of <abbr title="Encrypted Media Extensions">EME</abbr> came in in 2013:
this finally allowed a relatively quick phasing out of the Flash plugin,
and <em lang="lat">a posteriori</em> of the plugin interface that allowed its integration with the browsers:
by that time, the Flash plugin was by and large <em>the</em> plugin the API existed for,
and the plugin itself was indeed still supported by the browsers for some time after support for the API was otherwise discontinued
(sometimes through alternative interfaces such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPAPI">PPAPI</a>,
other times by keeping the NPAPI support around, but only enabled for the Flash plugin).</p>

<p>There are several interesting consideration that emerge from this little glimpse at the history of Flash and the EME.</p>

<p>First of all,
this is one more piece of history that goes to show how pivotal the year 2013 was for the enshittification of the World Wide Web,
<a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/google-killing-open-web/#2013">as discussed already</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly,
it shows how the developers of major browsers are more than willing to provide a smooth transition path with no user intervention,
at least when catering to the interests of major industries.
This indicates that when they don't, it's not because they <em>can't</em>:
it's because <em>they have a vested interest in not doing it</em>.
Major browser development is now (and has been for over a decade at least)
beholden not to the needs and wants of <em>their own users</em>,
but to those of other industries.
<a href="#surveillance">But I repeat myself</a>.</p>

<p>And thirdly, it's an excellent example, for the good and the bad, of how the plugin interface has helped drive the evolution of the web,
<a href="#pluginevolution">as I was saying</a>.</p>

<h3 id="controlledevolution"><a name="index2h3"></a>Controlled evolution</h3>

<p>The removal of NPAPI support,
followed a few years later by the removal of the (largely Chrome-specific) PPAPI interface
(that was supposed to be the “safer, more portable” evolution of NPAPI),
without providing <em>any</em> alternative,
is a very strong indication of the path that browser development has taken in the last “decade plus”:
a path where the Web is entirely controlled by what Google, Apple and Microsoft
(hey look, it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAFAM">GAFAM</a> all over again!) decide about what is allowed on it,
and what is <em>not</em> allowed to <em>not</em> be on it (to wit, ads and other user tracking implements).</p>

<p>In this perspective,
the transition from plugins to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/browser%20extensions">browser extensions</a> cannot be viewed (just) as a matter of security and portability,
but —more importantly, in fact— as a matter of crippled functionality:
indeed, extensions maintain <em>enough capabilities</em> to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension#Unwanted_behavior" title="Browser extension - Unwanted behavior">a vector of malware and adware</a>,
but <em>not enough</em> to circumvent unwanted browser behavior,
doubly more so with the so-called <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3" title="Extensions / Manifest V3">Extension Manifest V3</a>
specifically designed to thwart ad blocking
<a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/google-killing-open-web/#mv3">as I've already mentioned in the previous post of the series</a>.</p>

<p>With plugins, <em>anything</em> could be integrated in the World Wide Web,
and such integration would be close to as efficient as could be.
Without plugins, such integration, when possible at all,
becomes clumsier and more expensive.</p>

<p>As an example, there are browser extensions that can introduce support for JPEG&nbsp;XL to browsers that don't have native support.
This provides a workaround to display such images in said browsers,
but when a picture with multiple formats is offered
(which is what I do e.g. to provide a PNG fallback for the JXL images I provide),
this results in <em>both</em> the PNG <em>and</em> JXL formats being downloaded,
<em>increasing</em> the amount of data transferred instead of decreasing it
(one of the many benefits of JXL over PNG).
By contrast, a plugin could register itself a handler for the JPEG&nbsp;XL format,
and the browser would then be able to delegate rendering of the image to the plugin,
only falling back to the PNG in case of failure,
thus maximizing the usefulness of the format pending a built-in implementation.</p>

<p>The poster child of this lack of efficiency is arguably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathJax">MathJax</a>,
that has been carrying for nearly two decades the burden of bringing math to the web while browser implementors slacked off on their MathML support.
And while MathJax <em>does</em> offer more than just MathML support for browers without native implementations,
there is little doubt that it would be more effective in delivering the services it delivers
if it could be a plugin rather than a multi-megabyte
(any efforts to minimize its size notwithstanding)
JavaScript library each math-oriented website needs to load.</p>

<p>(In fact, it is somewhat surprising that there isn't a browser extesion version of MathJax that I can find
other than a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GreaseMonkey">GreaseMonkey</a> <a href="https://docs.mathjax.org/en/v1.0/dynamic.html#mathjax-and-greasemonkey" title="MathJax and GreaseMonkey">user script with convoluted usage requirements</a>,
but I guess this is the cost we have to pay for the library flexibility,
and the sandboxing requirements enforced on JavaScript in modern browsers.)</p>

<p>Since apparently “defensive writing” is a thing we need when jotting down an article such as this
(as if it even matters, given how little attention people give to what they read —if they read it at all— before commenting),
I should clarify that I'm not necessarily for a return to NPAPI advocating.
We have decades of experience about what could be considered the actual technical issues with that interface,
and how they can be improved upon
(which is for example what PPAPI allegedly did,
before Google decided it would be better off to kill plugins entirely
and thus gain full control of the Web as a platform),
as we do about sandboxing external code running in browsers
(largely through the efforts to sandbox JavaScript).
A better plugin API could be designed.</p>

<p>It's not going to happen.
It is now apparent that the major browsers explicitly and intentionally do not want to allow the kind of flexibility that plugins would allow,
hiding their controlling efforts behind security excuses.
It would thus be up to the minority browsers to come up with such an interface
(or actually multiple ones, at least one for protocols and one for document types),
but with most of them beholden to the rendering engines controlled by Google
(for the most part), Apple (some, still using WebKit over Blink), and Mozilla (the few Firefox forks),
they are left with very little leeway, if any at all, in terms of what they can support.</p>

<p>But even if, by some miraculous convergence, they did manage to agree on and implement support for such an API,
would there actually be an interest by third party to develop plugins for it?
I can envision this as a way for browsers to share coding efforts in supporting new protocols and formats before integrating them as first-class
(for example, the <a href="#gemini">already mentioned</a> Gemini protocol and gemtext format could be implemented first as a plugin
to the benefit of any browsers supporting such hypothetical interfaces)
but there be any interest in developing for it, rather tha just trying to get the feature implemented in the browsers themselves?</p>

<h3 id="ameshofbuildingblocks"><a name="index3h3"></a>A mesh of building blocks</h3>

<p>Still, let me dream a bit of something like this,
a browser made up of composable components,
protocol handlers separate from primary document renderers separate from attachment handlers.</p>

<dl>
<dt>A new protocol comes out?</dt>
<dd>Implement a plugin to handle that, and you can test it by delivering the same content over it,
and see it rendered just the same from the other components in the chain.</dd>
<dt>A new document format comes out?</dt>
<dd>Implement a plugin to handle that, and it will be used to render documents in the new format.</dd>
<dt>A new image format comes out?</dt>
<dd>Implement a plugin to handle that, and any image in the new format will be visible.</dd>
<dt>A new scripting language comes out?</dt>
<dd>You guessed it: implement a plugin to handle that&nbsp;…</dd>
</dl>

<p>How much tech would have had a real chance at proving itself in the field if this had been the case,
or would have survived being ousted not by technical limitations,
but by unfriendly corporate control?
Who knows, maybe
RSS and Atom integration would still be trivially at everybody's hand;
nobody would have had to fight with the long-standing bugs in PNG rendering from Internet Explorer,
MNG would have flourished, JPEG&nbsp;XL would have become ubiquituous six months after the specification had been finalized;
we would have seen HTML+SMIL provide declarative interactive documents without JavaScript as far back as 2008;
XSLT 2 and 3 would have long superseded XSLT 1 as <em>the</em> templating languages for the web,
or XSLT would have been supplanted by the considerably more accessible XQuery;
XHTML2 would have lived and grown alongside HTML5,
offering more sensible markup for many common features,
and much-wanted capabilities such as client-side includes.</p>

<p>The web would have been very different from what it is today,
and most importantly we would never would have had to worry
about a single corporation getting to dictate what is and what isn't allowed on the Web.</p>

<p>But the reality is much harsher and darker.
Google has control, and we do need to wrestle it out of their hands.</p>

<h2 id="resist"><a name="index6h2"></a>Resist</h2>

<p>So, do not comply.<br>
Resist.<br>
Force the unwanted tech through.<br>
Use RSS.<br>
Use XSLT.<br>
Adopt JPEG&nbsp;XL as your primary image format.<br>
And report newly broken sites for what they are:<br>
a browser fault, not a content issue.</p>

<h2 id="postscriptum"><a name="index7h2"></a>Post scriptum</h2>

<p>I would like to add here any <em lang="fr">pièces de résistance</em> for XSLT.</p>

<p>I'm going to inaugurate with a link <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2025/11/xslt-rip/">I've just discovered</a> thanks to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JWZ">JWZ</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://xslt.rip/">xslt.rip</a> (best viewed with a browser that supports XSLT; viewing the source is highly recommended);</p></li>
<li><p>and last but not least (yeah I know, doesn't make much sense with the current short list, but still),
a shameless plug of <a href="https://wok.oblomov.eu/">my own website</a>, of course,
because of the idea to use XSLT not to produce HTML, but to produce SVG.</p></li>

Posted <span>November 17, 2025</span> by  </p><ul> <li> <a href="https://replicate.com/bfirsh"> bfirsh </a> </li> </ul> </div><div> <video src="https://replicate.com/_content/assets/sky-loop.BBa_Oct6.mp4" muted="true" autoplay="" loop="" playsinline=""></video>
<p>Big news: We’re joining Cloudflare.</p>
<p>Replicate’s going to carry on as a distinct brand, and all that’ll happen is that it’s going to get way better. It’ll be faster, we’ll have more resources, and it’ll integrate with the rest of Cloudflare’s Developer Platform.</p>
<p>The API isn’t changing. The models you’re using today will keep working. If you’ve built something on Replicate, it’ll keep running just like it does now.</p>
<p>So, why are we doing this?</p>
<p>At Replicate, we’re building the primitives for AI: the tools and abstractions that let software developers use AI without having to understand all the complex stuff underneath.</p>
<p>We started with <a href="https://github.com/replicate/cog">Cog</a>, an open-source tool which defines a standard format for what a model is. Then, we created Replicate, a platform where people can share models and run them with an API. We’ve defined what a model is, how you publish it, how you run it, how you get data in and out.</p>
<p>These abstractions are like the low-level primitives of an operating system. But what’s interesting is that these primitives are running in the cloud. They have to — they need specialized GPUs and clusters to scale up in production. It’s like a distributed operating system for AI, running in the cloud. In other words, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-network-is-the-computer/">the network is the computer</a>.</p>
<p>Who has the best network? Cloudflare.</p>
<p>Cloudflare has built so many other parts of this operating system. Workers is the perfect platform for running agents and glue code. Durable Objects for managing state, R2 for storing files, WebRTC for streaming media.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve got these low-level abstractions, we can build higher-level abstractions. Ways to orchestrate models and build agents. Ways to run real-time models, or run models on the edge.</p>
<p>This is why we’re joining Cloudflare.</p>
<p>For my whole career, I’ve looked up to Cloudflare. How they built a product for developers, and turned that into a huge enterprise business. It’s the only public company that actually <em>gets</em> developers and knows how to build good products for them.</p>
<p>Cloudflare is the default for building web apps. From day one of Replicate, when we were building a prototype to apply to Y Combinator, we put Cloudflare in front of it.</p>
<p>Together, we’re going to become the default for building AI apps.</p>

<p dir="auto">The FreeMDU project provides open hardware and software tools for communicating with Miele appliances via their optical diagnostic interface. It serves as a free and open alternative to the proprietary <strong>Miele Diagnostic Utility (MDU)</strong> software, which is only available to registered service technicians.</p>
<p dir="auto">Most Miele devices manufactured after 1996 include an optical infrared-based diagnostic interface, hidden behind one of the indicator lights on the front panel. On older appliances, this interface is marked by a <strong>Program Correction (PC)</strong> label.</p>
<p dir="auto">Until now, communication with this interface required an expensive infrared adapter sold exclusively by Miele, along with their closed-source software. The goal of FreeMDU is to make this interface accessible to everyone for diagnostic and home automation purposes.</p>
<p dir="auto">The project is split into three main components:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/medusalix/FreeMDU/blob/master/protocol"><strong>Protocol</strong></a>: core protocol library and device implementations</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/medusalix/FreeMDU/blob/master/tui"><strong>TUI</strong></a>: terminal-based device diagnostic and testing tool</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/medusalix/FreeMDU/blob/master/home"><strong>Home</strong></a>: communication adapter firmware with MQTT integration for Home Assistant</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">More details about the proprietary diagnostic interface and the reverse-engineering process behind this project can be found in this <a href="https://medusalix.github.io/posts/miele-interface" rel="nofollow"><strong>blog post</strong></a>.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Caution</p><p dir="auto">This project is highly experimental and can cause permanent damage to your Miele devices if not used responsibly. Proceed at your own risk.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Supported devices</h2><a id="user-content-supported-devices" aria-label="Permalink: Supported devices" href="#supported-devices"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When a connection is established via the diagnostic interface, the appliance responds with its <strong>software ID</strong>, a 16-bit number that uniquely identifies the firmware version running on the device's microcontroller. However, this ID does not directly correspond to a specific model or board type, so it's impossible to provide a comprehensive list of supported models.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following table lists the software IDs and device/board combinations that have been confirmed to work with FreeMDU:</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>

<p dir="auto">If your appliance is not listed here but has a model number similar to one of the above, it might already be compatible. In all other cases, determining the <strong>software ID</strong> is the first step toward adding support for new devices.</p>
<p dir="auto">Details for adding support for new devices will be provided soon.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>Have you ever noticed just how much of the drama in movies is generated by an unspoken rule that the characters aren’t allowed to communicate well? Instead of naming the problem, they’re forced to skirt around it until the plot makes it impossible to ignore. It’s the cheapest way to build effective drama, but if you don’t fully dissolve yourself in the movie logic, the whole time you want to scream, “can’t anyone just talk about what’s happening directly?!”</p><p><span>Take </span><em>La La Land. </em><span>A huge part of the drama of the movie could have been avoided if the Ryan Gosling character said to the Emma Stone character: “I feel pressure to get a steady gig that includes lots of time on the road because I sense you want me to grow up and get real about my career. Could we talk about whether that’s what you actually want, and get clearer about our priorities?” Instead, they never talk about it, and the relationship explodes as a result of their misaligned expectations.</span></p><p><span>Or: </span><em>Good Will Hunting. </em><span>The entire movie feels like it could’ve been skipped if literally any emotionally intelligent person said to Matt Damon’s character: “I feel like you have a tremendous amount of intellectual potential that you’re wasting here — why are you getting in fights rather than trying to do something interesting?”</span></p><p><span>Communication failures like these make for good storytelling where we, the audience, get to watch the characters stumble towards understanding. But you shouldn’t </span><em>live</em><span> like someone waiting for the screenwriter of your life to arrange a convenient resolution. Functional people don’t let things linger unspoken — they name what’s facing them out loud.</span></p><p>It sounds like such a simple thing. And yet, so many of us don’t do it. It’s my experience that movie logic is endemic in dysfunctional organizations, friendships, and marriages. People walk around in a haze of denial, simply assuming that their concerns will disappear. They wait until the problem can’t possibly be ignored anymore, instead of naming it well before it becomes critical. Maybe they don’t even realize at a conscious level that the dynamic in question is capable of being named; they just take it as a background fact about the universe that they can strain against but not change.</p><p>What does it look like when you break out of movie logic? I remember the first time I realized I could do this. I was at a bar during my first year of law school with a bunch of people from my class, including a woman with whom I had an awkward dynamic stemming from an unfortunate misunderstanding about a guy. This awkwardness had calcified in my emotional brain to “we don’t like each other, we have beef.” But on that particular evening I had a moment of clarity, and instead of trying to avoid her I walked up to her and said, “I feel like we got off on the wrong foot because of that stupid thing, and I’m sorry about that — I don’t have anything against you at all.” In an instant, the look of flat wariness she’d put on when she saw me walking over melted into relief, and she said “I’m so glad you said that, I’ve been feeling awful about it.” She went on to be my closest friend in law school.</p><p><span>Outcomes like this are common when you figure out how to break the fourth wall. Whether or not both of you were already conscious of the real, underlying issue, when it is spoken out loud, the result is usually </span><em>relief</em><span>, like a spell has been broken. Even if the content is uncomfortable, it feels good in the way cutting through layers of unreality always does.</span></p><p>Some other lines of dialogue that would make for bad movies, but good living:</p><ul><li><p>“I’ve noticed that lately, every time we have plans to hang out one-on-one, you invite someone else to join us — is that intentional?”</p></li><li><p>“I always feel a little awkward around you, and I’m worried it comes across as me not liking you — I just wanted to say that’s not the case.”</p></li><li><p>“I’ve been feeling a low-level tension between us, like maybe we’re quietly annoyed at each other but trying to stay polite. Is that just me?”</p></li><li><p>“It sometimes seems like when I push back in meetings, it changes the energy in the room — like maybe you’re afraid to engage with me as directly as you do other people. Does that feel true?”</p></li></ul><p>Reading these examples, you might have noticed that it’s rare to hear people talk like this. I think there are a couple of reasons for that.</p><p>One is that it’s easy to mistake silence for informed diplomacy. If your manager is stressing you out, and you are putting up with it, it’s easy to think that you’re just being a good employee, and everyone is aware of how good you’re being. But unless your manager is quite emotionally intelligent, they may have no idea that you’re unhappy, especially if you’re engaging in people-pleasing behavior to try and cover it up.</p><p>Another reason is that it can feel like by naming an issue, you are making it into a big deal. But problems are real, and exert a toll on you, whether you name them or not. Naming the issue means you can interact with it.</p><p><span>Finally — often, the people who are most eager to name issues </span><em>kind of suck. </em><span>They are critical, judgmental people who lob opinions about how others should live without skill. Think of the person you’ve just met who confidently offers unsolicited advice about whatever they imagine your problem is.</span></p><p>But the answer to this is not to maintain the conspiracy of silence. The answer is to get skillful at naming issues.</p><p><strong>Tip 1: Take yourself outside the movie</strong></p><p>Before you even name an issue, it can help to ask: Actually, is this really the important issue to name? Or is my feeling about the issue a manifestation of something deeper that would be even more powerful to tackle?</p><p>For example, let’s say you want to tell a friend that you were bothered by the way they were bragging about how lavish and expensive their wedding was. Is that really the root issue? Or is the real issue an underlying dynamic of competitiveness stoked by both parties, where the relationship is worse off because both of you fill every conversation with social status claims?</p><p>To locate the possibility of going deeper, it can be helpful to take the movie metaphor literally — if you were an audience member watching the movie, what would you be screaming at yourself to say? What would a reader of this screenplay say the real, big unnamed issue is?</p><p><strong>Tip 2: If you feel you can’t name the problem, say that</strong></p><p>Let’s say you want to name a problem in one of your relationships, but you’re worried that presenting the problem would start an argument. Congratulations. You have now found the problem to name. You are allowed to say the following: “There’s an issue I see in our relationship, and I want to address it so our relationship is stronger. But I’m nervous about naming it, because I’m worried that it could start an argument, and I really don’t want you to feel attacked.”</p><p><span>This is advice that is applicable annoyingly often, to any meta-problem that makes a conversation difficult. </span><strong>You can always address the secondary problem.</strong><span> Many relationship advice conversations I have with friends go like this.</span></p><p><span>Friend: “I want to talk about [issue]</span><strong> </strong><span>with my partner, but when I get into the issue, I get flustered about it and stop making sense.”</span></p><p>Me: “Okay, what if you say that: I want to talk about this issue but it makes me flustered, and I stop making sense.”</p><p>Friend: “... Oh, why didn’t I think of that?”</p><p>The reason that they don’t think of it, I suspect, is that one way to avoid difficult conversations is to come up with a secondary problem that offers an excuse for avoiding the conflict, and then assume it’s impassable.</p><p><strong>Tip 3: Name things before you’re sure of what they are</strong></p><p>Sometimes, it’s hard to name a problem because you don’t fully understand it yet. But that’s completely okay — in many settings, you don’t even have to fully understand your feelings, or what is wrong, before you name a conflict. It can be powerful to say: “Something felt off about that meeting, like maybe something important wasn’t being said.” Or: “I think there’s something weird happening in this conversation, but I don’t know what it is.”</p><p>Human beings are near-telepathic in our ability to sense when an interpersonal dynamic is off — when someone is emotionally uncomfortable, or engaging in concealment. We all know the itchy feeling when nobody in an interaction is really being sincere. Pretty amazing how psychic we are, right?</p><p><span>Yes, we are psychic, but we are also stupid. Our sense that</span><em> something is weird </em><span>is often accurate, but our stories about precisely what the weirdness represents</span><em> </em><span>are often way, way off. So, in order to move from an interesting intuition to an accurate story about reality, it helps to enlist other people in the discussion by naming the intuition.</span></p><p>I’ve historically been hesitant to present my intuitions, because it feels sloppy. But having on more than one occasion overcome a “funny feeling” about a good-on-paper candidate to bad results, I’m now eager to make statements like: “It might not mean anything, but I can’t shake a weird feeling about that person. Do you get that same thing?”</p><p>This requires a little social discernment, of course. If you are a junior employee in a new workplace, it might not be tactically prudent to approach the CEO with the statement, “hey, couldn’t help but notice that the vibes are off.” But if you work closely with someone, err on the side of transparency.</p><p>You might ask — ultimately, what is so wrong with movie logic? Maybe you don’t have to address everything now. Sometimes a solution will present itself. And, I agree. It’s not fatal to, on occasion, engage in a little bit of hopeful silence, to see whether the problem you’re having with someone else is just a mood that might shift.</p><p>But over time, hopeful silence has corrosive effects. If you don’t name the real problems in your life, you eventually become alienated from your inner compass. You stop paying attention to your life on an experiential level, because you want to live in a pretend world of self-consolation. You lose the ability to see your life honestly.</p><p>Sometimes, I notice this when working with people who have spent time in organizations with poor feedback cultures. They have been taught that it’s so bad to name problems that they focus on resolving acute issues while keeping the peace, all the while navigating an invisible psychological obstacle course. Over time, they become trapped in people-pleasing, and this can blind them to real issues in the substance of their work. When people are like this, it’s difficult to get them to improve, because they see it as psychologically damaging to recognize their own limitations.</p><p>This is a skill I’m still working to get better at. It’s truly rare that someone reaches the ceiling — having no resistance to naming issues, and being maximally skillful about doing it. I’m not there yet. But I’m on my way, and it feels good to be moving in that direction. The better I get at it, the less I’m threatened by conflict, and the more it seems like an opportunity to clarify what’s really going on, to grow closer to myself and others. I don’t want to be the character in the movie who’s hopelessly buffeted by intrigue and too scared to investigate it dispassionately. I want to be like the director, who thoroughly understands the drama of each character, and finds the scene all the more interesting as a result.</p><p><em><strong><a href="https://mailchi.mp/44578760e686/book-preorder-signup" rel="">Sign up to be notified</a><span> when my book, You Can Just Do Things, is available for purchase.</span></strong></em></p></div></div>]]></description>

    <p><em>The story of how I wrote a leak-free, thread-safe grep in C23 without shooting yourself in the foot, and how you can too!</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Let's be honest: most people have a love-hate relationship with C. We love its raw speed, its direct connection to the metal, and its elegant simplicity. But we hate its footguns, its dragons, the untamed beasts. The segfaults that appear from nowhere, the memory leaks that slowly drain the life from our applications, and the endless goto cleanup; chains that make our code look like a plate of spaghetti pasta.</p>
<p>This is the classic C curse: power without guardrails...at least that's the <em>fear mongering mantra</em> being said again and again. But is that still relevant in today's world with all the tools available for C devs like static analyzer and dynamic sanitizers? I've written about this <a href="https://hwisnu.bearblog.dev/make-c-safe-again/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://hwisnu.bearblog.dev/debunking-the-unsafe-c-myths-part-2/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>What if, with the help of the modern tools and a custom header file (600 loc), you could tame those footguns beasts? What if you could keep C's power but wrap it in a suit of modern armor? That's what the custom header file safe_c.h is for. It's designed to give C some <mark>safety and convenience features from C++ and Rust</mark>, and I'm using it to build a high-performance grep clone called cgrep as my test case.</p>
<p>By the end this article I hope it could provide the audience with the idea of C is super flexible and extensible, sort of <em>"do whatever you want with it"</em> kind of thing. And this is why C (and its close cousin: Zig) remain to be my favorite language to write programs in; it's the language of freedom!</p>
<h2 id="safe_ch">safe_c.h</h2><p>Is a custom C header file that takes features mainly from C++ and Rust and implements them into our C code ~ [write C code, get C++ and Rust features!]</p>
<p>It starts by bridging the gap between old and new C. C23 gave us <code>[[cleanup]]</code> attributes, but in the real world, you need code that compiles on GCC 11 or Clang 18. safe_c.h detects your compiler and gives you the same RAII semantics everywhere. No more <code>#ifdef</code> soup.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>// The magic behind CLEANUP: zero overhead, maximum safety
#if defined(__STDC_VERSION__) &amp;&amp; __STDC_VERSION__ &gt;= 202311L
#define CLEANUP(func) [[cleanup(func)]]
#else
#define CLEANUP(func) __attribute__((cleanup(func)))
#endif

// Branch prediction that actually matters in hot paths
#ifdef __GNUC__
#define LIKELY(x)   __builtin_expect(!!(x), 1)
#define UNLIKELY(x) __builtin_expect(!!(x), 0)
#else
#define LIKELY(x)   (x)
#define UNLIKELY(x) (x)
#endif
</pre></div>
<p>Your cleanup code runs even if you return early, goto out, or panic. It's <code>finally</code>, but for C.</p>
<h2 id="the-memory-management-beast-slain-with-smart-pointers-c-feature">The Memory Management Beast: Slain with Smart Pointers (C++ feature)</h2><p>The oldest, fiercest and most feared by devs: manual memory management.</p>
<p>Before: the highway path to leaks.<br>
Forgetting a single <code>free()</code> is a disaster. In cgrep, parsing command-line options the old way is a breeding ground for CVEs and its bestiary. You have to remember to free the memory on every single exit path, difficult for the undisciplined.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// The Old Way (don't do this)</span>
<span>char</span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>include_pattern</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>optarg</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>include_pattern</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>strdup</span><span>(</span><span>optarg</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>// ...200 lines later...</span>
<span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>some_error</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>include_pattern</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>free</span><span>(</span><span>include_pattern</span><span>);</span><span> </span><span>// Did I free it? Did I??</span>
<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>// And remember to free it at *every* return path...</span>
</pre></div>
<p>After: memory that <strong>automatically</strong> cleans itself up.<br>
UniquePtr is a "smart pointer" that owns a resource. When the UniquePtr variable goes out of scope, its resource is automatically freed. It's impossible to forget.</p>
<p>Here's the machinery inside <code>safe_c.h</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>// The UniquePtr machinery: a struct + automatic cleanup
typedef struct {
    void* ptr;
    void (*deleter)(void*);
} UniquePtr;

#define AUTO_UNIQUE_PTR(name, ptr, deleter) \
    UniquePtr name CLEANUP(unique_ptr_cleanup) = UNIQUE_PTR_INIT(ptr, deleter)

static inline void unique_ptr_cleanup(UniquePtr* uptr) {
    if (uptr &amp;&amp; uptr-&gt;ptr &amp;&amp; uptr-&gt;deleter) {
        uptr-&gt;deleter(uptr-&gt;ptr);
        uptr-&gt;ptr = NULL;
    }
}
</pre></div>
<p>And here's how cgrep uses it. The cleanup is automatic, even if errors happen:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// In cgrep, we use this for command-line arguments</span>
<span>AUTO_UNIQUE_PTR</span><span>(</span><span>include_pattern_ptr</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>NULL</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>options_string_deleter</span><span>);</span>

<span>// When we get a new pattern, the old one is automatically freed!</span>
<span>unique_ptr_delete</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>include_pattern_ptr</span><span>);</span>
<span>include_pattern_ptr</span><span>.</span><span>ptr</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>strdup</span><span>(</span><span>optarg</span><span>);</span>
<span>// No leaks, even if an error happens later!</span>
</pre></div>
<p><strong>Sharing Safely with SharedPtr</strong></p>
<p>Before: manual, bug-prone reference counting.<br>
You'd have to implement reference counting by hand, creating a complex and fragile system where a single mistake leads to a leak or a use-after-free bug.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// The old way of manual reference counting</span>
<span>typedef</span><span> </span><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>{</span>

<span>    </span><span>pthread_mutex_t</span><span> </span><span>mutex</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span> </span><span>SharedStore</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span><span> </span><span>release_store</span><span>(</span><span>SharedStore</span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>

<span>    </span><span>pthread_mutex_unlock</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>s</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mutex</span><span>);</span>

<span>    </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>is_last</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>match_store_deleter</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>store</span><span>);</span>
<span>        </span><span>free</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>);</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>After: automated reference counting.<br>
SharedPtr automates this entire process. The last thread to finish using the object automatically triggers its destruction.
The machinery:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>// The SharedPtr machinery: reference counting without the boilerplate
typedef struct {
    void* ptr;
    void (*deleter)(void*);
    size_t* ref_count;
} SharedPtr;

#define AUTO_SHARED_PTR(name) \
    SharedPtr name CLEANUP(shared_ptr_cleanup) = {.ptr = NULL, .deleter = NULL, .ref_count = NULL}

static inline void shared_ptr_cleanup(SharedPtr* sptr) {
    shared_ptr_delete(sptr); // Decrement and free if last reference
}
</pre></div>
<p>The usage is clean and safe. No more manual counting.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// In our thread worker context, multiple threads access the same results store</span>
<span>typedef</span><span> </span><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>{</span>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In the end, cgrep is 2,300 lines of C. Without safe_c.h, it would have required over 50 manual free() calls ~ a recipe for leaks and segfaults. With the custom header file, it's 2,300 lines that compile to the same assembly, run just as fast, and are fundamentally safer.</p>
<p>This proves that the best abstraction is the one you don't pay for and can't forget to use. It enables a clear and powerful development pattern: validate inputs at the boundary, then unleash C's raw speed on the core logic. You get all the power of C without the infamous self-inflicted footgun wounds.</p>
<p>C simplicity makes writing programs with it becomes fun, however there are ways to make it both <strong>fun and safe</strong>..just like using condoms, you know?</p>
<p>This post has gotten too long for comfort, but I have one final food for thought for you the readers: after all these guard rails, what do you think of cgrep's performance? Check the screenshots below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>grep bench on recursive directories
<img src="https://i.ibb.co.com/ZpKKd4FS/grep-bench-recursive-Dirs.png" alt="recursive-Dirs"></p>
</li>
<li><p>grep bench on single large file
<img src="https://i.ibb.co.com/qMKqFhmm/grep-bench-single-Large-File.png" alt="Large-File">
<strong>NOTE: make sure you check the memory usage comparison between cgrep and ripgrep</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<hr>
<p>In the next article, I will discuss how I built cgrep, the design I chose for it, why and how cgrep managed to be a couple of times faster than ripgrep (more than 2x faster in the recursive directory bench) while being super efficient with resource usage (20x smaller memory footprint in the single large file bench).</p>
<p>It's gonna be a lot of fun! Cheers!</p>

                <h2>Why Build Your Own?</h2>
<p>Look, I know what you're thinking. "Why not just use Elasticsearch?" or "What about Algolia?" Those are valid options, but they come with complexity. You need to learn their APIs, manage their infrastructure, and deal with their quirks.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just want something that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Works with your existing database</li>
<li>Doesn't require external services</li>
<li>Is easy to understand and debug</li>
<li>Actually finds relevant results</li>
</ul>
<p>That's what I built. A search engine that uses your existing database, respects your current architecture, and gives you full control over how it works.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Core Idea</h2>
<p>The concept is simple: <strong>tokenize everything, store it, then match tokens when searching</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Indexing</strong>: When you add or update content, we split it into tokens (words, prefixes, n-grams) and store them with weights</li>
<li><strong>Searching</strong>: When someone searches, we tokenize their query the same way, find matching tokens, and score the results</li>
<li><strong>Scoring</strong>: We use the stored weights to calculate relevance scores</li>
</ol>
<p>The magic is in the tokenization and weighting. Let me show you what I mean.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Building Block 1: The Database Schema</h2>
<p>We need two simple tables: <code>index_tokens</code> and <code>index_entries</code>.</p>
<h3>index_tokens</h3>
<p>This table stores all unique tokens with their tokenizer weights. Each token name can have multiple records with different weights—one per tokenizer.</p>
<pre><code>// index_tokens table structure
id | name    | weight
---|---------|-------
1  | parser  | 20     // From WordTokenizer
2  | parser  | 5      // From PrefixTokenizer
3  | parser  | 1      // From NGramsTokenizer
4  | parser  | 10     // From SingularTokenizer
</code></pre>
<p>Why store separate tokens per weight? Different tokenizers produce the same token with different weights. For example, "parser" from WordTokenizer has weight 20, but "parser" from PrefixTokenizer has weight 5. We need separate records to properly score matches.</p>
<p>The unique constraint is on <code>(name, weight)</code>, so the same token name can exist multiple times with different weights.</p>
<h3>index_entries</h3>
<p>This table links tokens to documents with field-specific weights.</p>
<pre><code>// index_entries table structure
id | token_id | document_type | field_id | document_id | weight
---|----------|---------------|----------|-------------|-------
1  | 1        | 1             | 1        | 42          | 2000
2  | 2        | 1             | 1        | 42          | 500
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>weight</code> here is the final calculated weight: <code>field_weight × tokenizer_weight × ceil(sqrt(token_length))</code>. This encodes everything we need for scoring. We will talk about scoring later in the post.</p>
<p>We add indexes on:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(document_type, document_id)</code> - for fast document lookups</li>
<li><code>token_id</code> - for fast token lookups</li>
<li><code>(document_type, field_id)</code> - for field-specific queries</li>
<li><code>weight</code> - for filtering by weight</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this structure? Simple, efficient, and leverages what databases do best.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Building Block 2: Tokenization</h2>
<p>What is tokenization? It's breaking text into searchable pieces. The word "parser" becomes tokens like <code>["parser"]</code>, <code>["par", "pars", "parse", "parser"]</code>, or <code>["par", "ars", "rse", "ser"]</code> depending on which tokenizer we use.</p>
<p>Why multiple tokenizers? Different strategies for different matching needs. One tokenizer for exact matches, another for partial matches, another for typos.</p>
<p>All tokenizers implement a simple interface:</p>
<pre><code>interface TokenizerInterface
{
    public function tokenize(string $text): array;  // Returns array of Token objects
    public function getWeight(): int;               // Returns tokenizer weight
}
</code></pre>
<p>Simple contract, easy to extend.</p>
<h3>Word Tokenizer</h3>
<p>This one is straightforward—it splits text into individual words. "parser" becomes just <code>["parser"]</code>. Simple, but powerful for exact matches.</p>
<p>First, we normalize the text. Lowercase everything, remove special characters, normalize whitespace:</p>
<pre><code>class WordTokenizer implements TokenizerInterface
{
    public function tokenize(string $text): array
    {
        // Normalize: lowercase, remove special chars
        $text = mb_strtolower(trim($text));
        $text = preg_replace('/[^a-z0-9]/', ' ', $text);
        $text = preg_replace('/\s+/', ' ', $text);
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we split into words and filter out short ones:</p>
<pre><code>        // Split into words, filter short ones
        $words = explode(' ', $text);
        $words = array_filter($words, fn($w) =&gt; mb_strlen($w) &gt;= 2);
</code></pre>
<p>Why filter short words? Single-character words are usually too common to be useful. "a", "I", "x" don't help with search.</p>
<p>Finally, we return unique words as Token objects:</p>
<pre><code>        // Return as Token objects with weight
        return array_map(
            fn($word) =&gt; new Token($word, $this-&gt;weight),
            array_unique($words)
        );
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Weight: 20 (high priority for exact matches)</p>
<h3>Prefix Tokenizer</h3>
<p>This generates word prefixes. "parser" becomes <code>["par", "pars", "parse", "parser"]</code> (with min length 4). This helps with partial matches and autocomplete-like behavior.</p>
<p>First, we extract words (same normalization as WordTokenizer):</p>
<pre><code>class PrefixTokenizer implements TokenizerInterface
{
    public function __construct(
        private int $minPrefixLength = 4,
        private int $weight = 5
    ) {}
    
    public function tokenize(string $text): array
    {
        // Normalize same as WordTokenizer
        $words = $this-&gt;extractWords($text);
</code></pre>
<p>Then, for each word, we generate prefixes from the minimum length to the full word:</p>
<pre><code>        $tokens = [];
        foreach ($words as $word) {
            $wordLength = mb_strlen($word);
            // Generate prefixes from min length to full word
            for ($i = $this-&gt;minPrefixLength; $i &lt;= $wordLength; $i++) {
                $prefix = mb_substr($word, 0, $i);
                $tokens[$prefix] = true; // Use associative array for uniqueness
            }
        }
</code></pre>
<p>Why use an associative array? It ensures uniqueness. If "parser" appears twice in the text, we only want one "parser" token.</p>
<p>Finally, we convert the keys to Token objects:</p>
<pre><code>        return array_map(
            fn($prefix) =&gt; new Token($prefix, $this-&gt;weight),
            array_keys($tokens)
        );
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Weight: 5 (medium priority)</p>
<p>Why min length? Avoid too many tiny tokens. Prefixes shorter than 4 characters are usually too common to be useful.</p>
<h3>N-Grams Tokenizer</h3>
<p>This creates character sequences of a fixed length (I use 3). "parser" becomes <code>["par", "ars", "rse", "ser"]</code>. This catches typos and partial word matches.</p>
<p>First, we extract words:</p>
<pre><code>class NGramsTokenizer implements TokenizerInterface
{
    public function __construct(
        private int $ngramLength = 3,
        private int $weight = 1
    ) {}
    
    public function tokenize(string $text): array
    {
        $words = $this-&gt;extractWords($text);
</code></pre>
<p>Then, for each word, we slide a window of fixed length across it:</p>
<pre><code>        $tokens = [];
        foreach ($words as $word) {
            $wordLength = mb_strlen($word);
            // Sliding window of fixed length
            for ($i = 0; $i &lt;= $wordLength - $this-&gt;ngramLength; $i++) {
                $ngram = mb_substr($word, $i, $this-&gt;ngramLength);
                $tokens[$ngram] = true;
            }
        }
</code></pre>
<p>The sliding window: for "parser" with length 3, we get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Position 0: "par"</li>
<li>Position 1: "ars"</li>
<li>Position 2: "rse"</li>
<li>Position 3: "ser"</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this works? Even if someone types "parsr" (typo), we still get "par" and "ars" tokens, which match the correctly spelled "parser".</p>
<p>Finally, we convert to Token objects:</p>
<pre><code>        return array_map(
            fn($ngram) =&gt; new Token($ngram, $this-&gt;weight),
            array_keys($tokens)
        );
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Weight: 1 (low priority, but catches edge cases)</p>
<p>Why 3? Balance between coverage and noise. Too short and you get too many matches, too long and you miss typos.</p>
<h3>Normalization</h3>
<p>All tokenizers do the same normalization:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lowercase everything</li>
<li>Remove special characters (keep only alphanumerical)</li>
<li>Normalize whitespace (multiple spaces to single space)</li>
</ul>
<p>This ensures consistent matching regardless of input format.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Building Block 3: The Weight System</h2>
<p>We have three levels of weights working together:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Field weights</strong>: Title vs content vs keywords</li>
<li><strong>Tokenizer weights</strong>: Word vs prefix vs n-gram (stored in index_tokens)</li>
<li><strong>Document weights</strong>: Stored in index_entries (calculated: <code>field_weight × tokenizer_weight × ceil(sqrt(token_length))</code>)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Final Weight Calculation</h3>
<p>When indexing, we calculate the final weight like this:</p>
<pre><code>$finalWeight = $fieldWeight * $tokenizerWeight * ceil(sqrt($tokenLength));
</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title field: weight 10</li>
<li>Word tokenizer: weight 20</li>
<li>Token "parser": length 6</li>
<li>Final weight: <code>10 × 20 × ceil(sqrt(6)) = 10 × 20 × 3 = 600</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Why use <code>ceil(sqrt())</code>? Longer tokens are more specific, but we don't want weights to blow up with very long tokens. "parser" is more specific than "par", but a 100-character token shouldn't have 100x the weight. The square root function gives us diminishing returns—longer tokens still score higher, but not linearly. We use <code>ceil()</code> to round up to the nearest integer, keeping weights as whole numbers.</p>
<h3>Tuning Weights</h3>
<p>You can adjust weights for your use case:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase field weights for titles if titles are most important</li>
<li>Increase tokenizer weights for exact matches if you want to prioritize exact matches</li>
<li>Adjust the token length function (ceil(sqrt), log, or linear) if you want longer tokens to matter more or less</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see exactly how weights are calculated and adjust them as needed.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Building Block 4: The Indexing Service</h2>
<p>The indexing service takes a document and stores all its tokens in the database.</p>
<h3>The Interface</h3>
<p>Documents that can be indexed implement <code>IndexableDocumentInterface</code>:</p>
<pre><code>interface IndexableDocumentInterface
{
    public function getDocumentId(): int;
    public function getDocumentType(): DocumentType;
    public function getIndexableFields(): IndexableFields;
}
</code></pre>
<p>To make a document searchable, you implement these three methods:</p>
<pre><code>class Post implements IndexableDocumentInterface
{
    public function getDocumentId(): int
    {
        return $this-&gt;id ?? 0;
    }
    
    public function getDocumentType(): DocumentType
    {
        return DocumentType::POST;
    }
    
    public function getIndexableFields(): IndexableFields
    {
        $fields = IndexableFields::create()
            -&gt;addField(FieldId::TITLE, $this-&gt;title ?? '', 10)
            -&gt;addField(FieldId::CONTENT, $this-&gt;content ?? '', 1);
        
        // Add keywords if present
        if (!empty($this-&gt;keywords)) {
            $fields-&gt;addField(FieldId::KEYWORDS, $this-&gt;keywords, 20);
        }
        
        return $fields;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Three methods to implement:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getDocumentType()</code>: returns the document type enum</li>
<li><code>getDocumentId()</code>: returns the document ID</li>
<li><code>getIndexableFields()</code>: builds fields with weights using fluent API</li>
</ul>
<p>You can index documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>On create/update (via event listeners)</li>
<li>Via commands: <code>app:index-document</code>, <code>app:reindex-documents</code></li>
<li>Via cron (for batch reindexing)</li>
</ul>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>Here's the indexing process, step by step.</p>
<p>First, we get the document information:</p>
<pre><code>class SearchIndexingService
{
    public function indexDocument(IndexableDocumentInterface $document): void
    {
        // 1. Get document info
        $documentType = $document-&gt;getDocumentType();
        $documentId = $document-&gt;getDocumentId();
        $indexableFields = $document-&gt;getIndexableFields();
        $fields = $indexableFields-&gt;getFields();
        $weights = $indexableFields-&gt;getWeights();
</code></pre>
<p>The document provides its fields and weights via the <code>IndexableFields</code> builder.</p>
<p>Next, we remove the existing index for this document. This handles updates—if the document changed, we need to reindex it:</p>
<pre><code>        // 2. Remove existing index for this document
        $this-&gt;removeDocumentIndex($documentType, $documentId);
        
        // 3. Prepare batch insert data
        $insertData = [];
</code></pre>
<p>Why remove first? If we just add new tokens, we'll have duplicates. Better to start fresh.</p>
<p>Now, we process each field. For each field, we run all tokenizers:</p>
<pre><code>        // 4. Process each field
        foreach ($fields as $fieldIdValue =&gt; $content) {
            if (empty($content)) {
                continue;
            }
            
            $fieldId = FieldId::from($fieldIdValue);
            $fieldWeight = $weights[$fieldIdValue] ?? 0;
            
            // 5. Run all tokenizers on this field
            foreach ($this-&gt;tokenizers as $tokenizer) {
                $tokens = $tokenizer-&gt;tokenize($content);
</code></pre>
<p>For each tokenizer, we get tokens. Then, for each token, we find or create it in the database and calculate the final weight:</p>
<pre><code>                foreach ($tokens as $token) {
                    $tokenValue = $token-&gt;value;
                    $tokenWeight = $token-&gt;weight;
                    
                    // 6. Find or create token in index_tokens
                    $tokenId = $this-&gt;findOrCreateToken($tokenValue, $tokenWeight);
                    
                    // 7. Calculate final weight
                    $tokenLength = mb_strlen($tokenValue);
                    $finalWeight = (int) ($fieldWeight * $tokenWeight * ceil(sqrt($tokenLength)));
                    
                    // 8. Add to batch insert
                    $insertData[] = [
                        'token_id' =&gt; $tokenId,
                        'document_type' =&gt; $documentType-&gt;value,
                        'field_id' =&gt; $fieldId-&gt;value,
                        'document_id' =&gt; $documentId,
                        'weight' =&gt; $finalWeight,
                    ];
                }
            }
        }
</code></pre>
<p>Why batch insert? Performance. Instead of inserting one row at a time, we collect all rows and insert them in one query.</p>
<p>Finally, we batch insert everything:</p>
<pre><code>        // 9. Batch insert for performance
        if (!empty($insertData)) {
            $this-&gt;batchInsertSearchDocuments($insertData);
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>findOrCreateToken</code> method is straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>    private function findOrCreateToken(string $name, int $weight): int
    {
        // Try to find existing token with same name and weight
        $sql = "SELECT id FROM index_tokens WHERE name = ? AND weight = ?";
        $result = $this-&gt;connection-&gt;executeQuery($sql, [$name, $weight])-&gt;fetchAssociative();
        
        if ($result) {
            return (int) $result['id'];
        }
        
        // Create new token
        $insertSql = "INSERT INTO index_tokens (name, weight) VALUES (?, ?)";
        $this-&gt;connection-&gt;executeStatement($insertSql, [$name, $weight]);
        
        return (int) $this-&gt;connection-&gt;lastInsertId();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Why find or create? Tokens are shared across documents. If "parser" already exists with weight 20, we reuse it. No need to create duplicates.</p>
<p>The key points:</p>
<ul>

<h2>Building Block 5: The Search Service</h2>
<p>The search service takes a query string and finds relevant documents. It tokenizes the query the same way we tokenized documents during indexing, then matches those tokens against the indexed tokens in the database. The results are scored by relevance and returned as document IDs with scores.</p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>Here's the search process, step by step.</p>
<p>First, we tokenize the query using all tokenizers:</p>
<pre><code>class SearchService
{
    public function search(DocumentType $documentType, string $query, ?int $limit = null): array
    {
        // 1. Tokenize query using all tokenizers
        $queryTokens = $this-&gt;tokenizeQuery($query);
        
        if (empty($queryTokens)) {
            return [];
        }
</code></pre>
<p>If the query produces no tokens (e.g., only special characters), we return empty results.</p>
<h3>Why Tokenize the Query Using the Same Tokenizers?</h3>
<p>Different tokenizers produce different token values. If we index with one set and search with another, we'll miss matches.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indexing with PrefixTokenizer creates tokens: "par", "pars", "parse", "parser"</li>
<li>Searching with only WordTokenizer creates token: "parser"</li>
<li>We'll find "parser", but we won't find documents that only have "par" or "pars" tokens</li>
<li>Result: Incomplete matches, missing relevant documents!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The solution</strong>: Use the same tokenizers for both indexing and searching. Same tokenization strategy = same token values = complete matches.</p>
<p>This is why the <code>SearchService</code> and <code>SearchIndexingService</code> both receive the same set of tokenizers.</p>
<p>Next, we extract unique token values. Multiple tokenizers might produce the same token value, so we deduplicate:</p>
<pre><code>        // 2. Extract unique token values
        $tokenValues = array_unique(array_map(
            fn($token) =&gt; $token instanceof Token ? $token-&gt;value : $token,
            $queryTokens
        ));
</code></pre>
<p>Why extract values? We search by token name, not by weight. We need the unique token names to search for.</p>
<p>Then, we sort tokens by length (longest first). This prioritizes specific matches:</p>
<pre><code>        // 3. Sort tokens (longest first - prioritize specific matches)
        usort($tokenValues, fn($a, $b) =&gt; mb_strlen($b) &lt;=&gt; mb_strlen($a));
</code></pre>
<p>Why sort? Longer tokens are more specific. "parser" is more specific than "par", so we want to search for "parser" first.</p>
<p>We also limit the token count to prevent DoS attacks with huge queries:</p>
<pre><code>        // 4. Limit token count (prevent DoS with huge queries)
        if (count($tokenValues) &gt; 300) {
            $tokenValues = array_slice($tokenValues, 0, 300);
        }
</code></pre>
<p>Why limit? A malicious user could send a query that produces thousands of tokens, causing performance issues. We keep the longest 300 tokens (already sorted).</p>
<p>Now, we execute the optimized SQL query. The <code>executeSearch()</code> method builds the SQL query and executes it:</p>
<pre><code>        // 5. Execute optimized SQL query
        $results = $this-&gt;executeSearch($documentType, $tokenValues, $limit);
</code></pre>
<p>Inside <code>executeSearch()</code>, we build the SQL query with parameter placeholders, execute it, filter low-scoring results, and convert to SearchResult objects:</p>
<pre><code>private function executeSearch(DocumentType $documentType, array $tokenValues, int $tokenCount, ?int $limit, int $minTokenWeight): array
{
    // Build parameter placeholders for token values
    $tokenPlaceholders = implode(',', array_fill(0, $tokenCount, '?'));
    
    // Build the SQL query (shown in full in "The SQL Query" section below)
    $sql = "SELECT sd.document_id, ... FROM index_entries sd ...";
    
    // Build parameters array
    $params = [
        $documentType-&gt;value,  // document_type
        ...$tokenValues,       // token values for IN clause
        $documentType-&gt;value,  // for subquery
        ...$tokenValues,       // token values for subquery
        $minTokenWeight,      // minimum token weight
        // ... more parameters
    ];
    
    // Execute query with parameter binding
    $results = $this-&gt;connection-&gt;executeQuery($sql, $params)-&gt;fetchAllAssociative();
    
    // Filter out results with low normalized scores (below threshold)
    $results = array_filter($results, fn($r) =&gt; (float) $r['score'] &gt;= 0.05);
    
    // Convert to SearchResult objects
    return array_map(
        fn($result) =&gt; new SearchResult(
            documentId: (int) $result['document_id'],
            score: (float) $result['score']
        ),
        $results
    );
}
</code></pre>
<p>The SQL query does the heavy lifting: finds matching documents, calculates scores, and sorts by relevance. We use raw SQL for performance and full control—we can optimize the query exactly how we need it.</p>
<p>The query uses JOINs to connect tokens and documents, subqueries for normalization, aggregation for scoring, and indexes on token name, document type, and weight. We use parameter binding for security (prevents SQL injection).</p>
<p>We'll see the full query in the next section.</p>
<p>The main <code>search()</code> method then returns the results:</p>
<pre><code>        // 5. Return results
        return $results;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>The Scoring Algorithm</h3>
<p>The scoring algorithm balances multiple factors. Let's break it down step by step.</p>
<p>The base score is the sum of all matched token weights:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT 
    sd.document_id,
    SUM(sd.weight) as base_score
FROM index_entries sd
INNER JOIN index_tokens st ON sd.token_id = st.id
WHERE 
    sd.document_type = ?
    AND st.name IN (?, ?, ?)  -- Query tokens
GROUP BY sd.document_id
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>sd.weight</code>: from index_entries (field_weight × tokenizer_weight × ceil(sqrt(token_length)))</li>
</ul>
<p>Why not multiply by <code>st.weight</code>? The tokenizer weight is already included in <code>sd.weight</code> during indexing. The <code>st.weight</code> from <code>index_tokens</code> is used only in the full SQL query's WHERE clause for filtering (ensures at least one token with weight &gt;= minTokenWeight).</p>
<p>This gives us the raw score. But we need more than that.</p>
<p>We add a token diversity boost. Documents matching more unique tokens score higher:</p>
<pre><code>(1.0 + LOG(1.0 + COUNT(DISTINCT sd.token_id))) * base_score
</code></pre>
<p>Why? A document matching 5 different tokens is more relevant than one matching the same token 5 times. The LOG function makes this boost logarithmic—matching 10 tokens doesn't give 10x the boost.</p>
<p>We also add an average weight quality boost. Documents with higher quality matches score higher:</p>
<pre><code>(1.0 + LOG(1.0 + AVG(sd.weight))) * base_score
</code></pre>
<p>Why? A document with high-weight matches (e.g., title matches) is more relevant than one with low-weight matches (e.g., content matches). Again, LOG makes this logarithmic.</p>
<p>We apply a document length penalty. Prevents long documents from dominating:</p>
<pre><code>base_score / (1.0 + LOG(1.0 + doc_token_count.token_count))
</code></pre>
<p>Why? A 1000-word document doesn't automatically beat a 100-word document just because it has more tokens. The LOG function makes this penalty logarithmic—a 10x longer document doesn't get 10x the penalty.</p>
<p>Finally, we normalize by dividing by the maximum score:</p>
<pre><code>score / GREATEST(1.0, max_score) as normalized_score
</code></pre>
<p>This gives us a 0-1 range, making scores comparable across different queries.</p>
<p>The full formula looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT 
    sd.document_id,
    (
        SUM(sd.weight) *                                  -- Base score
        (1.0 + LOG(1.0 + COUNT(DISTINCT sd.token_id))) * -- Token diversity boost
        (1.0 + LOG(1.0 + AVG(sd.weight))) /              -- Average weight quality boost
        (1.0 + LOG(1.0 + doc_token_count.token_count))   -- Document length penalty
    ) / GREATEST(1.0, max_score) as score                -- Normalization
FROM index_entries sd
INNER JOIN index_tokens st ON sd.token_id = st.id
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT document_id, COUNT(*) as token_count
    FROM index_entries
    WHERE document_type = ?
    GROUP BY document_id
) doc_token_count ON sd.document_id = doc_token_count.document_id
WHERE 
    sd.document_type = ?
    AND st.name IN (?, ?, ?)  -- Query tokens
    AND sd.document_id IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT document_id
        FROM index_entries sd2
        INNER JOIN index_tokens st2 ON sd2.token_id = st2.id
        WHERE sd2.document_type = ?
        AND st2.name IN (?, ?, ?)
        AND st2.weight &gt;= ?  -- Ensure at least one token with meaningful weight
    )
GROUP BY sd.document_id
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT ?
</code></pre>
<p>Why the subquery with <code>st2.weight &gt;= ?</code>? This ensures we only include documents that have at least one matching token with a meaningful tokenizer weight. Without this filter, a document matching only low-priority tokens (like n-grams with weight 1) would be included even if it doesn't match any high-priority tokens (like words with weight 20). This subquery filters out documents that only match noise. We want documents that match at least one meaningful token.</p>
<p>Why this formula? It balances multiple factors for relevance. Exact matches score high, but so do documents matching many tokens. Long documents don't dominate, but high-quality matches do.</p>
<p>If no results with weight 10, we retry with weight 1 (fallback for edge cases).</p>
<h3>Converting IDs to Documents</h3>
<p>The search service returns <code>SearchResult</code> objects with document IDs and scores:</p>
<pre><code>class SearchResult
{
    public function __construct(
        public readonly int $documentId,
        public readonly float $score
    ) {}
}
</code></pre>
<p>But we need actual documents, not just IDs. We convert them using repositories:</p>
<pre><code>// Perform search
$searchResults = $this-&gt;searchService-&gt;search(
    DocumentType::POST,
    $query,
    $limit
);

// Get document IDs from search results (preserving order)
$documentIds = array_map(fn($result) =&gt; $result-&gt;documentId, $searchResults);

// Get documents by IDs (preserving order from search results)
$documents = $this-&gt;documentRepository-&gt;findByIds($documentIds);
</code></pre>
<p>Why preserve order? The search results are sorted by relevance score. We want to keep that order when displaying results.</p>
<p>The repository method handles the conversion:</p>
<pre><code>public function findByIds(array $ids): array
{
    if (empty($ids)) {
        return [];
    }
    
    return $this-&gt;createQueryBuilder('d')
        -&gt;where('d.id IN (:ids)')
        -&gt;setParameter('ids', $ids)
        -&gt;orderBy('FIELD(d.id, :ids)')  // Preserve order from IDs array
        -&gt;getQuery()
        -&gt;getResult();
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>FIELD()</code> function preserves the order from the IDs array, so documents appear in the same order as search results.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Result: What You Get</h2>
<p>What you get is a search engine that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finds relevant results quickly</strong> (leverages database indexes)</li>
<li><strong>Handles typos</strong> (n-grams catch partial matches)</li>
<li><strong>Handles partial words</strong> (prefix tokenizer)</li>
<li><strong>Prioritizes exact matches</strong> (word tokenizer has highest weight)</li>
<li><strong>Works with existing database</strong> (no external services)</li>
<li><strong>Easy to understand and debug</strong> (everything is transparent)</li>
<li><strong>Full control over behavior</strong> (adjust weights, add tokenizers, modify scoring)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Extending the System</h2>
<p>Want to add a new tokenizer? Implement <code>TokenizerInterface</code>:</p>
<pre><code>class StemmingTokenizer implements TokenizerInterface
{
    public function tokenize(string $text): array
    {
        // Your stemming logic here
        // Return array of Token objects
    }
    
    public function getWeight(): int
    {
        return 15; // Your weight
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Register it in your services configuration, and it's automatically used for both indexing and searching.</p>
<p>Want to add a new document type? Implement <code>IndexableDocumentInterface</code>:</p>
<pre><code>class Comment implements IndexableDocumentInterface
{
    public function getIndexableFields(): IndexableFields
    {
        return IndexableFields::create()
            -&gt;addField(FieldId::CONTENT, $this-&gt;content ?? '', 5);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Want to adjust weights? Change the configuration. Want to modify scoring? Edit the SQL query. Everything is under your control.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So there you have it. A simple search engine that actually works. It's not fancy, and it doesn't need a lot of infrastructure, but for most use cases, it's perfect.</p>
<p>The key insight? Sometimes the best solution is the one you understand. No magic, no black boxes, just straightforward code that does what it says.</p>
<p>You own it, you control it, you can debug it. And that's worth a lot.</p>

Let me explain.</p><p>The <em>uKc7FPnEO++lVhHWHFlGbQ</em> value (iPad) needs to be added to <em>mtrAoWJ3gsq+I90ZnQ0vQw</em>, which is <strong>DeviceClassNumber</strong>, like this:</p><p><em>mtrAoWJ3gsq+I90ZnQ0vQw</em> : <em>uKc7FPnEO++lVhHWHFlGbQ</em></p><p>Which translates to <strong>DeviceClassNumber</strong> : 3 (iPad)</p><p>But how can you add this if the CacheData section is garbled?</p><h2>Finding the right offset inside the libmobilegestalt.dylib</h2><p>The <strong>/usr/lib/libMobileGestalt.dylib</strong> is not accessible from the sandbox, so we cannot read it via an Xcode-made app like before, but we can dlopen the libmobilegestalt.dylib and parse its segments. If we can do that, we can look for the encrypted key <em>mtrAoWJ3gsq+I90ZnQ0vQw</em> and find the offset.</p><p>Then we would know where to place our modified keys.</p><p>You can adapt the SwiftUI app from earlier to <strong>dlopen</strong> the dylib quite easily.

            <h3>The expiry of key patents for LFP battery chemistry in 2022 transformed the EV industry. With technology now freely accessible, global battery strategies are shifting as former IP barriers fall.</h3>
    <p>An LFP battery is a type of lithium-ion battery that uses lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) as the cathode material. LFP’s appeal in the EV sector is clear: lower cost compared to batteries based on nickel and cobalt chemistries, low toxicity and good safety due to their superior thermal stability. Tesla’s use of LFP in some of its standard-range models signalled the beginning of a broader trend, now accelerating across Western markets. LFP batteries are also proving a popular choice for renewable energy storage.</p>
<p>However, barriers to commercialisation of LFP technology remain. With the core chemistry now in the public domain, the focus of intellectual property protection has shifted. Companies are securing patents around secondary innovation, with a focus on enhancing energy density, improving safety, fast-charging capabilities and reducing costs. For example, CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited) has developed and commercialised cell-to-pack technology with its Quilin battery. BYD and Tesla, amongst others, also own patents relating to LFP technology. Such proprietary engineering technology will still deliver competitive advantage. Trade secrets and manufacturing know-how are also becoming increasingly valuable.</p>
<p>Freedom-to-operate (FTO) analysis therefore remains critical for market entrants. Whilst the primary patents have expired, a dense web of secondary patents, covering additives, coatings, and production methods, still poses infringement risks. Firms entering the LFP space need to engage in increasingly nuanced FTO due diligence to navigate this residual IP thicket and minimise their risk of being on the receiving end of an infringement lawsuit.</p>
<p>Aside from the patent landscape, there are other structural and strategic barriers for exploitation of LFP technology:</p>
<ul>
    <li>recycling economics: as LFP batteries lack high-value metals like cobalt and nickel, they are less attractive to recyclers. This poses a challenge in light of EU regulations requiring lithium-ion batteries to contain at least 6% recycled lithium by 2031, rising to 12% by 2036. Whilst companies are developing new capabilities, for example UK-based Altilium’s proprietary EcoCathode technology, which promises to recover 97% lithium and 99% graphite from used LFP cells, these technologies are in their infancy.</li>
    <li>supply chain dependencies: Western manufacturers remain heavily reliant on Chinese suppliers for high tap-density iron phosphate precursors (which allows for increased energy density in the battery) and cell manufacturing expertise.</li>
    <li>infrastructure misalignment: the UK’s charging infrastructure still needs to be significantly developed to encourage uptake of EVs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the LFP patent cliff is not the end of the story. Rather it is the beginning of a new chapter in EV innovation, where competitive advantage can still be obtained through further technological developments. For IP professionals and EV strategists, the task is to develop protection strategies that reflect this new paradigm. Effective trade secret and patent protection will be essential components of this, as well as the formation of strategic partnerships.&nbsp;</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>Can PicoIDE emulate more than 1 drive at a time?</dt>
                <dd>Currently PicoIDE only emulates one drive, but the hardware is capable of supporting two devices simultaneously. Enabling this is a priority for development after the PicoIDE is released.</dd>

                <dt>Can you add [hardware feature]?</dt>
                <dd>The current hardware design is locked in, but who knows what the future may bring.</dd>

                <dt>Will PicoIDE work in my device?</dt>
                <dd>The primary development/testing platform for PicoIDE is 90s-era PCs, but PicoIDE has a high level of compatibility with the ATA and ATAPI standards, so there's a good chance it will work in your device. If your device is particularly finicky, that sounds like a fun development challenge!</dd>

                <dt>What about UDMA support?</dt>
                <dd>In the interest of providing a cost-effective design, PicoIDE's hardware doesn't support UDMA, but faster systems are very well served in the area of fast HDD replacements by CF, SD, and M.2 to IDE adapters, and for optical, PicoIDE's MWDMA mode 2 and PIO mode 4 support is as fast as a 52X CD-ROM drive, plenty for fast systems.</dd>

                <dt>Will there be a 5.25" or 2.5" version?</dt>
                <dd>PicoIDE will launch with a 3.5" enclosure only, but depending how things go, other form factors may be made available.</dd>

                <dt>When will PicoIDE be available?</dt>
                <dd>PicoIDE will be launching soon™. Sign up below to be notified when it becomes available for purchase.</dd>
                
                <dt>Where will I be able to purchase a PicoIDE? How much will it cost?</dt>
                <dd>Availability and pricing will be announced when PicoIDE is launched. If you're familiar with <a href="https://picog.us/">PicoGUS</a>, you know I value making attainable hardware.</dd>

						It is a little known fact, that Ms Spears is an expert in semiconductor
						physics. Not content with just singing and acting, in the following pages, she
						will guide you in the fundamentals of the vital semiconductor laser components that have made it possible to hear her super music in a digital format.

However, such treatments offer a very different outlook with regard to recurring revenue versus chronic therapies," analyst Salveen Richter wrote in the note to clients Tuesday. "While this proposition carries tremendous value for patients and society, it could represent a challenge for genome medicine developers looking for sustained cash flow."</p></div><div id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-105119182" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder" role="region" tabindex="0" data-vilynx-id="7000012181" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-105119182"><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105119335-2ED1-PL-MegT-040918.jpg?v=1529477963&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="Biotech shares soar on dealmaking, drug progress"><span></span><span></span></p></div><div><p>Richter cited <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-1"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GILD/">Gilead Sciences'</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> treatments for hepatitis C, which achieved cure rates of more than 90 percent. The company's U.S. sales for these hepatitis C treatments peaked at $12.5 billion in 2015, but have been falling ever since. Goldman estimates the U.S. sales for these treatments will be less than $4 billion this year, according to a table in the report.</p><p>"GILD is a case in point, where the success of its hepatitis C franchise has gradually exhausted the available pool of treatable patients," the analyst wrote. "In the case of infectious diseases such as hepatitis C, curing existing patients also decreases the number of carriers able to transmit the virus to new patients, thus the incident pool also declines … Where an incident pool remains stable (eg, in cancer) the potential for a cure poses less risk to the sustainability of a franchise."</p><p>The analyst didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The report suggested three potential solutions for biotech firms:</p><div><p>"Solution 1: Address large markets: Hemophilia is a $9-10bn WW market (hemophilia A, B), growing at ~6-7% annually."</p><p> "Solution 2: Address disorders with high incidence: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) affects the cells (neurons) in the spinal cord, impacting the ability to walk, eat, or breathe."</p><p> "Solution 3: Constant innovation and portfolio expansion: There are hundreds of inherited retinal diseases (genetics forms of blindness) … Pace of innovation will also play a role as future programs can offset the declining revenue trajectory of prior assets."</p></div></div></div></div>]]></description>
