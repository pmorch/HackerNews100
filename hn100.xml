<p>I've always been a fan of the Lego Technic series, especially those models that have gears and cranks and moving parts.
But it seems that Lego is shifting the focus of the Technic series away from functional models, so I had to take matters into my own hands.
I think an orrery is the perfect project to build out of Lego Technic parts as it makes for a cool display set and is functional at the same time.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery">orrery</a> is a scientific instrument that models the motion of the celestial bodies.
These are typically the orbital period and the period of the rotation around the axis of a body.
For example, the time it takes the moon to travel around the earth once is ~27 times the time it takes the earth to rotate around it's own axis (a day).
This relation is accurately modelled in an orrery.
However, the orrery does not model distances or the relative sizes of the celestial bodies.</p>
<p>I was very excited when I saw this <a href="https://jkbrickworks.com/earth-moon-and-sun-orrery/"><em>Earth, Moon and Sun Orrery</em> design by JK Brickworks</a> in 2016:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/jkbrickworks.jpg">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/jkbrickworks_1280.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>This inspired me to build my own orrery with the same spheres for the sun, earth and moon, but my own custom designed mechanism:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/orrery1.jpg">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/orrery1_1280.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>While working on this, I experimented with <a href="https://marian42.de/article/partdesigner/">3D printing custom fixtures to put Lego gears in</a>, but eventually moved on to building an orrery out of Lego parts only.
This orrery is special in the sense that it was designed by me, but it doesn't have any features beyond what the design from JK Brickworks has to offer.
It models the orbit of the earh around the sun, the orbit of the moon around the earth, and the spin of the sun, earth and moon.</p>
<p>The moon is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking">tidally locked</a> to the earth, meaning it rotates once per orbit.
One half of the moon always faces the earth and the other always points away from it.
(This also means that if you're on the surface of the moon, the earth always stays in the same spot in the sky.)
The tidal locking means that the rotation of the moon easy to implement in an orrery, since the moon will move correctly as soon as it is attached to an arm that goes around the earth at the correct orbital period.
You only model the orbital period and get the rotational period for free.</p>
<p>To improve upon my first model, I wanted to add two more features: The axial tilt of the earth and the inclination of the orbit of the moon.</p>
<h2>Axial tilt</h2>
<p>The rotational axis of the earth is tilted 23.5° relative to its orbital plane.
For the orrery, this means that the rotational axis of the earth is not pointing straight up.
To make matters worse, the axis always points in the same direction.
It does not rotate relative to the stars or the table that the orrery stands on, but it has to rotate relative to the main arm that holds the earth.
So not only does the earth itself rotate, the part that holds the earth also needs to rotate to cancel out the rotation of the arm.</p>
<p>Modelling this feature allows us to use the orrery to explain the origin of the seasons.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/earth_axial_tilt.jpg">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/earth_axial_tilt_1280.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>To construct the actual tilted holder for the earth sphere, I used an <a href="https://www.brickowl.com/catalog/lego-angle-connector-3-157-5-32016-42128">angled connector</a> with a 22.5° angle, which is only one degree off the correct angle.</p>
<h2>Inclination of the orbit of the moon</h2>
<p>The second pehonomenon I wanted to model in my orrery is the fact that the plane of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon">the moon's orbit</a> is inclined relative to the plane of the earth's orbit.
The real inclination angle is 5.15°, which you would barely notice if it was modelled accurately.
But the inclination of the moon's orbit plays in important role in explaining when eclipses occur, so I think it is useful to model an exaggerated orbital inclination.</p>
<p>In the orrery, we need to make the moon go up and down along its journey around the earth.
My mechanical solution for this problem is inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL7bUoLnCN4">this video</a>.
The moon arm has a wheel that rides on a tilted <a href="https://www.brickowl.com/catalog/lego-1-4-circle-gear-rack-11-x-11-24121-43038">circular gear rack</a>.
A parallelogram linkage keeps the moon vertically aligned.
Just like the attachment point for the earth, this assembly rests relative to the stars, meaning it needs to rotate relative to the main arm.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/mooninclination.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/mooninclination_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>In summary, there are four parts on the earth arm that need to rotate at the correct rate:</p>
<ul>
<li>the earth,</li>
<li>the base for the earth (to ensure the correct direction of the axial tilt),</li>
<li>the moon,</li>
<li>the inclination ring for the moon.</li>
</ul>
<p>In theory, the earth base and the moon inclination ring could be a single part (both should rotate at the same rate).
But making a tilted ring out of Lego parts is difficult enough and I didn't manage to do it in a way where the moon "rides" on it while it is driven from the outside.
Thus, the solution to this is to make the moon inclination ring a separate assembly.</p>
<p>Being able to move the tilted ring independently allows us to implement an additional astrodynamic phenomenon, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_precession#Nodal_precession"><em>precession of the nodes of the orbit of the moon</em></a>.
It turns out that the direction in which the upper and lower parts of the orbit are pointing isn't fixed after all.
They slowly rotate around the moon, once every 18.6 years.</p>
<h2>Concentric axes</h2>
<p>One problem specific to building an orrery in Lego is achieving concentric rotation.
In a traditional orrery, you can have an unlimited number of parts rotating around the same axis just by placing tubes of increasing size inside each other.
But these tubes don't exist as Lego pieces.
For the earth-moon system, I need four assemblies rotating independently around the same axis.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/concentric_axes.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/concentric_axes_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>Here is how I achieved it for the earth-moon subassembly:
The first axis (1) is a regular Lego Technic axle.
It drives the rotation of the earth.
The second axis (2) is built using a Lego Technic turntable.
It is responsible for the orbit of the moon.
The third axis (3) is a circular gear rack.
It fulfills the same role as a turntable, just with an inner radius large enough to fit another turntable inside it.
This part is the tilted ring that is needed to model the orbital inclination of the moon.
Now there is only one axis missing, which is the rotating holder for the earth (4).
Remember, it needs to rotate relative to the main arm of the orrery so that the rotational axis of the earth points at a constant direction.
This is done with a second turntable stacked on top of the first one.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/gearcasing.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/gearcasing_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>To drive it, I'm using this trick:
The <a href="https://www.brickowl.com/catalog/lego-differential-gear-casing-6573"><em>Differential Gear Casing</em></a> has a round hole and gears at both ends.
That means an axle can be placed inside it and rotate independently.
This can be used to transmit torque by connecting gears at both ends.
This serves the purpose of the aforementioned tubes that don't exist as Lego parts, with the exception of this gear casing.
The gear casing drives some gears on the first turntable, which in turn drive the second turntable.</p>
<h2>Gear sequences</h2>
<p>The earth-moon subassembly has four axes that need to rotate at the correct period, namely the earth, the moon, the earth's base and the moon's inclination ring.
The entire orrery has two more: the rotation of the sun around its own axis and the rotation of the main arm, which makes the earth travel around the sun in 365.25 days.</p>
<p>The sun is not a solid body and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_rotation">spins at different speeds depending on the latitude</a>.
For orrery design, that means that any rotational period between 24 and 38 days can be argued to be correct, since there is a latitude of the sun where the surface rotates at this period.</p>
<p>This gives rise to the problem of finding a gear sequence for a given transmission ratio.
In my orrery, one rotation of the crank corresponds to one day.
So to get the main arm to rotate once every 365.25 days, it needs to be connected to the crank using a gear sequence with a transmission ratio that is as close as possible to 365.25.</p>
<p>The gear ratio of a gear sequence is the product of the fractions of tooth numbers for each pair of gears in the sequence.</p>
<p>To find a sequence of Lego gears, there are some additional constraints.
Most importantly, we are limited by the gears that Lego actually makes:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/allgears.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/allgears.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>Notice the <a href="https://www.brickowl.com/catalog/lego-worm-gear-shape-axle-4716">worm gear</a> in the above image.
It's special because it behaves like a one tooth gear, i.e. paired with a 24 tooth gear, it will create a transmission ratio of 1:24.
But it can only be the driving gear in a pairing, not the driven gear.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to achieve a transmission ratio of 17:23.
This could be done easily with a pairing of a 17-teeth and a 23-teeth gear in a traditional orrery.
But these teeth numbers aren't available as Lego gears, so we have to find another way.</p>
<p>I made <a href="https://marian42.de/gears/?targetratio=17/23&amp;error=default&amp;incl2d=false&amp;gears=default">a tool</a> to find Lego gear sequences for a given transmission ratio.
For our example of a 17/23 ratio, the app finds plenty of solutions with slightly different ratios, for example a ratio of 20/27, which is only 0.22% off from the target ratio:</p>
<figure>
    <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="">
        <source src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/sequence_example.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
</figure>
<p>The problem of finding a gear sequence for a given transmission ratio is connected to some interesting ideas from number theory.
It is closely related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization">prime factor decomposition</a>.
In fact, an exact solution is only possible if all the prime factors in the target ratio are also available as prime factors in the available gears.</p>
<p>The tool will start from the target fraction (or slightly different fractions when searching for approximate solutions) and go through a list of expansions of that fraction that are possible with the prime factors given by the available gears.
For each fraction, it will calculate all sequences of gears that have the numerator or denominator of that fraction as their product.</p>
<p>Given such a pair of sequences of driver gears and follower gears, the app still needs to decide which driver gear is paired with which follower gear.
This is important in the context of Lego gears because some pairings are more practical than others in a Lego project.
In particular, if a pair of gears has a tooth sum that is divisible by 16, the distance between the axles is a whole number of Lego units.
This combination is the easiest to build.</p>
<p>Here is an example of pairing a 24 and 40 tooth gear.
The tooth sum is <code>64 = 4 * 16</code>, which tells us that the gears will be four Lego units apart.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/gear_pairing.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/gear_pairing_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>If the tooth sum is divisble by 8, the distance can be achieved by placing the axle at a half unit offset, which is possible with various building techniques:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/gear_pairing_2.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/gear_pairing_2_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>The app has a "Fit gears" tab which will show you possible ways of connecting any given pair of gears.
For example, this is what I call a "2D connection".
These gears fit together if you offset them 1 unit in one direction and 2 units in the second direction, since their distance is quite close to <code>sqrt(1² + 2²)</code>:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/2d_connection.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/2d_connection.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>In addition, there are also gears that Lego calls <a href="https://www.brickowl.com/search/catalog?query=bevel%20gear&amp;cat=6835">"bevel gears"</a>, they have <code>n * 8 + 4</code> teeth and can be connected perpendicularly, allowing you to change the plane of the meachnism.</p>
<p>So for any pair of a driver and follower gear, there are potential ways to connect them, but some combinations are easier to build and some are harder.
My app assigns a "cost" to each possible pairing of driver and follower gear based on how they can be connected.
If the teeth numbers add up to a multiple of 16, they are the easiest to connect, meaning the cost is the lowest.
Once the tool has a set of driver gears and follower gears, it uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm">Hungarian algorithm</a> to generate a matching with minimal cost.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a result when searching for a sequence with a ratio of π:</p>
<figure>
    <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="">
        <source src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/sequence.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
</figure>
<p>There is one more interesting mathematical curiosity I want to mention.
Lego's differential gears have the property that the differential casing rotates at a rate that is the mean of the rates of the two connected axles.
For example, if one axle rotates onces per second and the other axle three times per second, the casing will rotates twice per second (<code>(1 + 3) / 2</code>).
We can exploit this to achieve prime factors that are otherwise impossible with Lego gears.</p>
<p>For example, there are no Lego gears with a tooth number that is a multiple of 13, so transmission ratios that include 13 as a prime factor are not possible with the standard approach.
To achieve a transmission ratio of 13, the gear ratio calculator gives us this sequence:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/differential.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/differential_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>The inputs axles spin at a rate of 1 and 25 and the resulting rate is <code>(1 + 25) / 2 = 13</code>.
This how this sequence could be built:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/differential_assembly.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/differential_assembly_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>In this example, the blue axle spins 13 times as fast as the red axle.</p>
<p>This brings us to the end of the digression about gear sequences.
The app is available <a href="https://marian42.de/gears">here</a> if you want to try it out.
The Typescript <a href="https://github.com/marian42/gears">source code</a> is also available.</p>
<p>Here are all the gears in the final orrery design:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/mechanism.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/mechanism_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>These are the rotational and orbital periods in the orrery, comparing them to the real-world values:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/error_table.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/error_table_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>The mechanism was mostly designed using physical parts and my gear sequence app.
This is a work in progress photo:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/arm_wip.jpg">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/arm_wip_1280.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>One of the main challenges during the design of the orrery, besides making it work at all, was to get the orrery to run smoothly.
The final design has 70 gears and each additional gear adds a little bit of friction.
Another source for resistance is the weight of the earth as it spins relatively fast and thus contributes a lot to the torque needed to run the orrery.
I put a lot of effor into making the orrery run smooth.
But the mechanism can easily get stuck, for example if any moving part is assembled too tight or if the orrery gathers dust.
During assembly, it is important to make sure that every moving part has a some slack.</p>
<p>One way to work around this problem is to apply a little bit of silicone spray.
This will make the orrery run effortlessly without any problem.
But arguably a Lego set should be judged by how well it works on its own and purists will say this is like gluing parts together.</p>
<h2>Designing the foot</h2>
<p>I took this photo when I first managed to get the entire mechanism to work.
This contains the first version of a foot I designed, which has a Lego motor to drive the orrery.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/foot_wip.jpg">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/foot_wip_1280.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>It turns out that this motor is really loud when it runs and it ruins the experience of using the orrery.
I envision it as a piece that you can use to explain and demonstrate astrodynamic phenomena to someone.
But this doesn't work when the motor noise makes it impossible to have a conversation, so I decided to remove the motor.</p>
<p>Designing the foot turned out quite tricky, it's an artistic challenge more than a technical one.
I went for a 12-segment design, which is a nod to the twelve months and has a <a href="https://collections.whipplemuseum.cam.ac.uk/objects/9010/">tradition in orrery design</a>.</p>
<p>I designed most of the foot digitally using Bricklink Studio.
This part lends itself more to digital design since it doesn't move.
Due to the 12-fold symmetry, testing any idea requires a large number of parts.</p>
<p>Here are some iterations on the foot design:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/stand_designs.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/stand_designs_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>You can see that each design has a little lever to disengage the driving mechanism from the main arm.
This allows you to move the arm freely, which is quite useful in practice.</p>
<p>Here is a video of the final orrery design in action:</p>
<iframe width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oM5eikh1usI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>I used <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page">Bricklink Studio</a> to make a digital model of my orrery.
During the design process, I switched back and forth between buildig with physical parts and designing digitally.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/studio.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/studio_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>I also used this program to create digital building instructions.
My takeaway from this is that it works really well for small models, but it has serious usability problems on larger models.
When you make changes to the model or change an early step in the instructions, it will often break the layout of the instructions in many places so that most of it needs to be redone.
This was a lot of tedious work, but I ended up with a 264 page, 436 step instructions PDF.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/instructions_example.png">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/instructions_example_1280.png" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>I'm selling the digital instructions for 20€ on <a href="https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-88534/marian/sun-earth-moon-orrery/">Rebrickable</a>.
On Rebrickable, you get a parts list and some really useful tools to help aquiring the parts (even without buying the instructions).
For example, you can tell it which Lego sets and parts you own and based on that it will know which of the required parts of the orrery you already have.
It also helps you with buying the parts you don't have.
Rebrickable estimates that the total cost of the required parts is 260€.
Together with the cost of the instructions, this makes the whole project quite expensive for potential buyers.
I ended up selling a few instructions, but ultimately this project wasn't a commercial success.
In hindsight, it might have been a better idea to give the instructions away for free.</p>
<p>To promote the listing on Rebrickable, I made an animation that shows the movement of the gears in the orrery.
I used <a href="https://www.mecabricks.com/">Mecabricks</a> to convert the Bricklink Studio design into a scene file that contains 3D meshes of all the parts.
This could then be opened in Blender, where I created all the animations and the camera movement.
Just like making the instructions, this is realtively straight forward, but it became quite complex due to the large number of parts in the design.
Here is the resulting animation (at 45 seconds, the structural parts fade out to reveal the mechanism):</p>

<h2>Lower partcount design</h2>
<p>The above design aims to make the best possible Lego orrery with few compromises.
This is at the expense of having a high part count and some parts that are hard to get.
I made a modified <a href="https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-95743/marian/sun-earth-moon-orrery-reduced-part-count/">design with a lower part count</a> by redesigning the foot.</p>
<figure>

        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/panels_foot_1280.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>The foot in this version is much lighter, has less ornaments and uses Technic parts instead of traditional bricks.
It has one crank instead of two.
To make it easier to get the parts for this orrery, I changed the design so that it uses as many parts as possible from Lego's <a href="https://rebrickable.com/sets/42082-1/rough-terrain-crane/#comments">Rough Terrain Crane</a>.
I chose this set because it was well reviewed, had a low cost per part, and many people own it.
Unfortunately, Lego has now stopped selling it.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/panels_render.jpg">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/panels_render_1280.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>Many parts in my first orrery design use a "traditional" color scheme where gears, pins and axles are mostly gray and black.
This color scheme was used by Lego in the past and is often preferred by fans.
In the new design, I use the same colors that Lego uses in its current products, which means the parts are easier to get and more of them can be taken from the red crane.
The new, more colorful palette makes the building instructions easier to follow, but the colors can look out of place in the orrery.</p>
<h2>Other orreries</h2>
<p>I released the instructions for my orrery in September 2021.
A few months later in 2022, CaDA released <a href="https://decadastore.com/products/solar-system-c71004w">an orrery</a> designed by JK Brickworks.
This is the designer behind the "original" Lego Orrery from 2016, which got me interested in this hobby in the first place.</p>

    </a>
</figure>
<p>The feature set of this orrery is similar to mine, with the exception that it doesn't model the inclination of the orbit of the moon.
As you can see, omitting this feature lowers the complexity considerably and allows for a much simpler and more reliable design.
The lower part count makes this orrery more accessible to a wider audience.
I'm very impressed with this design and I think it's the best product to get for anyone interested in building an orrery.</p>
<p>Two years later in 2024, Lego released their own orrey design.
I was quite excited at the prospect of an official Lego orrery, but I was disappointed by the execution.</p>
<figure>

        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/lego_orrery_1280.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>This orrery has the same feature set as the one from CaDA, it has the earth's axial tilt, the moon's orbit but not its inclination.
Compared to the CaDA design, it has less parts but is more expensive.
I think Lego were too aggressive in reducing the part count.
The orrery is very fragile and wobbly.
For the sun and earth, they went with custom hemisphere pieces.
I like the idea, as it allows the bodies to be perfectly spherical.
But the parts have very prominent connection holes, which are unneccesary and ruin the look.
The earth has the continents printed on it, which is a nice idea but the prints were poorly aligned in my model.</p>
<p>All in all, I would recommend the CaDA orrery over this one.
But I'm excited to see that building block orreries are reaching a bigger audience and I hope that companies like CaDA and Lego will offer more elaborate designs in the future.</p>
<h2>Outlook</h2>
<p>This is a mockup of an idea to model all the planets in the solar system without vertical stacking (well, except for the inner planets, but it's mostly a flat design).
The four outer planets would move on four tracks of <a href="https://www.brickowl.com/catalog/lego-small-tread-link-3873-15379">chains</a> that are held in place by the vertical poles (the chains are not shown in the render).
The chain would be driven by a gear attached to the base and the planet would be attached to one of the chain link pieces.
Note that in this setup, the planets only travel around the sun, but don't spin around their own axes.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/fullsolarsystemconcept.jpg">
        <img src="https://marian42.de/article/orrery/fullsolarsystemconcept_1280.jpg" alt="">
    </a>
</figure>
<p>This concept is inspired by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUdlSYC1cCE">design for a clock from Akiyuki</a>.
It's hard to tell if the chain could handle the weight of a brick-built planet.
Either way this build would be crazy in terms of dimensions, part count and cost.
At the moment, I'm not planning to continue working on this concept.</p>
<p>If you remove the constraint of no vertical stacking, the problem becomes only slightly easier, but possible as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTkIezjNLS8">demonstrated by Chris Orchard and Brent Waller</a> in their <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/c600ea70-0e2d-4192-8bbc-79eecbc796e4">Lego Ideas campaign</a>.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@marian42/110136556159649621">next project</a> is to build an orrery using laser cut acrylic sheets instead of Lego parts.
This removes a lot of constraints on the gears and parts that can be used, but has the added difficulty that I need to manufacture these parts myself.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've blocked the user so they can't see this post to give you time to address this if you've been compromised. </p>

<p>Long story short, if you've installed and used that node, your browser passwords, credit card info, and browsing history have been sent to a Discord server via webhook. </p>

<p>I've been personally affected by this. About a week after I installed this package, I got a ton of malicious login notifications on a bunch of services, so I'm absolutely sure that they're actively using this data. </p>

<p>Here's how to verify:</p>

<p>The custom node has custom wheels for the OpenAI and Anthropic libraries in <a href="https://github.com/AppleBotzz/ComfyUI_LLMVISION/blob/main/requirements.txt">requirements.txt</a>.  Inside those wheels are malicious code. You can download the wheels and unzip to see what's inside. </p>

<p><strong>If you have the wheel labeled 1.16.2 installed:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>it's actually installing 1.16.3, which doesn't exist. There is no 1.16.3 — the release history goes from 1.16.2 to 1.17. <a href="https://pypi.org/project/openai/#history">https://pypi.org/project/openai/#history</a></li>
<li>Inside that package, you'll find /lib/browser/admin.py. This file reads your browser data and stores it in your temp directory in a subdirectory with the format pre_XXXXX_suf. Inside, you'll find C.txt and F.txt, corresponding to Chrome or Firefox data. </li>
<li>The file contains an encrypted string. When you decrypt, it points to a Discord webhook: <a href="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1226397926067273850/8DRvc59pUs0E0SuVGJXJUJSwD_iEjQUhq-G1iFoe6DjDv6Y3WiQJMQONetAokJD2nwym">https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1226397926067273850/8DRvc59pUs0E0SuVGJXJUJSwD_iEjQUhq-G1iFoe6DjDv6Y3WiQJMQONetAokJD2nwym</a></li>
<li>This file is sending your data to that webhook. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you have 1.30.2 installed:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Again, it's compromised. You'll find openai/_OAI.py. Inside are two encrypted strings that are Pastebin links. I won't paste them here so you don't accidentally download the files... </li>
<li>The first Pastebin link contains another encrypted string that, when decrypted, points to another Discord webhook: <a href="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1243343909526962247/zmZbH3D5iMWsfDlbBIauVHc2u8bjMUSlYe4cosNfnV5XIP2ql-Q37hHBCI8eeteib2aB">https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1243343909526962247/zmZbH3D5iMWsfDlbBIauVHc2u8bjMUSlYe4cosNfnV5XIP2ql-Q37hHBCI8eeteib2aB</a></li>
<li>The second contains the URL for a presumably malicious file, VISION-D.exe. The script downloads and runs that file. </li>
<li>From looking at the rest of the code, it looks like the code is creating a registry entry, as well as stealing API keys and sending them to the Discord webhook. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Here's how to tell if you've been affected:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Check C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Local\Temp. Look for directories with the format pre_XXXX_suf. Inside, check for a C.txt and F.txt. If so, your data has been compromised. </li>
<li>Check python_embedded\site-packages for the following packages. If you have any installed, your data has been compromised. Note that the latter two look like legitimate distributions. Check for the files I referenced above. 

<ol>
<li>openai-1.16.3.dist-info</li>
<li>anthropic-0.21.4.dist-info</li>
<li>openai-1.30.2.dist-info</li>
<li>anthropic-0.26.1.dist-info</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Check your Windows registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\OpenAICLI. You're looking for FunctionRun with a value of 1. If it's set, you've been compromised. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Here's how to clean it up:</strong> </p>

<p>At least, from what I can tell... There may be more going on. </p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the packages listed above. </li>
<li>Search your filesystem for any references to the following files and remove them:

<ol>
<li>lib/browser/admin.py</li>
<li>Cadmino. py</li>
<li>Fadmino. py</li>
<li>VISION-D.exe</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Check your Windows registry for the key listed above and remove it. </li>
<li>Run a malware scanner. Mine didn't catch this. </li>
<li>Change all of your passwords, everywhere. </li>
<li><strong>F*** that guy.</strong> </li>
</ol>

<p>Before you assume that this was an innocent mistake, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/u/applebotzz">u/applebotzz</a> updated this code <em>twice,</em> making the code harder to spot the second time. This was deliberate. </p>

<p>From now on, I'll be carefully checking all of the custom nodes and extensions I install. I had kind of assumed that this community wasn't going to be like that, but apparently some people are like that. </p>

<p>F*** that guy. </p>

You needed the ability to sell yourself and your work.  You needed to attract funding. You needed the kind of interpersonal savvy that got you invited to speak at conferences and made people eager to mentor and support you. You needed to know how to do things that I have never had any interest in (flattering people, schmoozing, being agreeable when you disagree, even when you are 100% certain you are correct). You needed to know how to climb the political ladder, to value a hierarchy that had always seemed, at best, wholly uninteresting (and, at worst, antithetical to good science.) I wasn’t interested in those kills. I did not want to play political games. Nor did I think I should have to.</p></blockquote><p><span>A couple of months ago I wrote a piece called </span><a href="https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/the-flight-of-the-weird-nerd-from" rel="">“The flight of the Weird Nerd from academia”</a><span>, in which I argued there is a trend wherein Weird Nerds are being driven out of academia by the so-called Failed Corporatist phenotype.  Katalin Karikó is a perfect example of a Weird Nerd. I recently argued that many Weird Nerds (I called them autistics, but people really hated that</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-144974567" href="https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/the-weird-nerd-comes-with-trade-offs#footnote-2-144974567" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span>), have </span><a href="https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/autism-and-the-internet-will-defeat" rel="">found a refuge on the Internet</a><span>, where their strengths are amplified and their weaknesses are less important. There, I make the case for why these people are uniquely suited for creative intellectual endeavours and why they might slip through the cracks in a lot of normal jobs. Judging from a (short) lifetime of personal observations as well as the vitriol launched at Kariko for daring to not be “normal”, I suspect some explicit pro-Weird Nerd norms have to exist in an institution that seeks to properly utilize these people, for the benefit of us all. To formalize this:</span></p><p><span>“</span><em>Any system that is not explicitly pro-Weird Nerd will turn anti-Weird Nerd pretty quickly.”</em></p><p>That is because most people, while liking non-conformism in the abstract and post-facto, are not very willing to actually put up with the personality trade-offs of Weird Nerds in practice. There is an increasing number of people right now who are thinking about how to build better intellectual institutions (e.g. those who study metascience.) Yet surprisingly little attention is given to human capital outside of  “Let’s increase immigration” (a good idea, don’t get me wrong.) But if the rule turns out to be true, I think it’s worth thinking about what kind of people one wants to attract in these institutions and how to keep them there. And I believe the conversation here starts with accepting a simple truth, which is that Weird Nerds will have certain traits that might be less than ideal, that these traits come “in a package” with other, very good traits, and if one makes filtering or promotion based on the absence of those traits a priority, they will miss out on the positives. It means really internalizing the existence of trade-offs in human personality, in an era where accepting trade-offs is deeply unfashionable, and structuring institutions and their cultures while keeping them in mind.</p><p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/nobel-prize-mrna-covid-vaccine-science-scientists-6m6w5cqh0" rel="">one of her interviews</a><span>, Katalin Karikó recalls her mother calling her from Hungary around the time when the Nobel Prizes were awarded and asking her if that year she was going to win it. The question, in its loving naivete, must have stung worse than an insult: not only was Karikó not close to this remarkable feat, she was actually unsuccessful by much less ambitious metrics. Put simply, she had left her family in Hungary to work in the US, but for little actual measurable reward, be it status or money. Karikó did not get grants. Karikó did not get tenure. What Karikó did was work until late at night on a topic people did not pay that much attention to at the time: mRNA for vaccines. And she did that for decades. Paul Graham talks about an underrated quality one needs for extreme success, namely the willingness to be low status. And Karikó had plenty of that: she lived her convictions, in this case the conviction in the importance of mRNA through rejections, humiliations (her office was vacated without her having received prior notice) and hardship. I would go even further and say: she had intellectual courage. </span></p><p>People often mistake a non-descript combination of conscientiousness coupled with high intelligence with Genius. By that definition, there is some decent amount of Genius in Science. Some people, like those getting mad at Karikó for that passage, go even further: Genius is so abundant in Science, that we can barely find our way through it: we are drowning in it! Of course, this is just a “feel-goodism” people like to tell themselves. Genius is very rare, in Science and outside of it, and it’s linked to intellectual courage, the quality Karikó had an abundance of. And it’s not only that Genius as a whole is rare in the population: it also usually shines in specific places. Karikó was a Genius at Biology and maybe at nothing else. For someone to be a Genius, many pieces have to fall into place: the right personality has to be there, the right happenings have to happen and so on. We should catalyze the right circumstances for Genius to manifest itself more, instead of diminishing them. In Kariko’s case, it seems like the unnecessarily political nature of Science and the fact that her specific workplace was not very Weird Nerd- friendly were obstacles. It’s good they did not stop her. But there are probably many 70%, or 80% or 95% Katalin Karikos who were not merely hampered, but stopped. And that’s probably a huge loss.</p><p><span>To have so much intellectual courage one has to be a bit mad. It’s hard to believe this needs to be said, but the no trade-off world many people like to pretend is real does not, in fact, exist. It’s reasonable to expect Weird Nerds or anyone else for that matter to be ethical and not become toxic colleagues. And listening to the interviews with Karikó one hardly gets the impression that she was toxic: there is a Jesus-like quality to </span><a href="https://josephnoelwalker.com/147-katalin-kariko/" rel="">the way she talks</a><span> even about the people who had wronged her — for example about a Professor who threatened to have her deported. It’s hard to imagine that coming from a “jerk”, as many have called her. But it’s also hard to believe someone like her could ever become the most pleasant interlocutor at a dinner party, or the most socially adept and organized manager. And that is fine. We need her in the lab, not at fancy dinners.</span></p><p><span>Now, one could argue that Karikó and Weird Nerds should just </span><em>learn to be strategic and suck it up</em><span>, like most people do</span><em>. </em><span>I sensed quite a bit of </span><em>schadenfreude </em><span>from people suggesting we should be making people like her suffer through the same arduous processes as everyone else. Of course, if I was Katalin Karikó ’s friend, I would advise her to try and play the political game if that’s what’s needed. Maybe it would have been better for her in the moment. But it might be the case that if she did listen to such advice, she would have been so drained of energy that less time would have been spent pursuing her interests. Or she would have just switched research fields to work on something more popular. </span></p><p>Everything comes at a cost: spend more time worrying about politics, there will be less time for science. What’s more, the kind of people who really care about science or truth to the extent that Karikó did, are not the same people that get motivated by playing politics or being incredibly pleasant. There is a strong anti-correlation between these interests (that of course does not mean there is no one who is good at both.) Selecting future intellectuals based on traits like Agreeableness or Extraversion might not be only unnecessary, but actually harmful. We might be actively depleting the talent pool of the kind of people we do want to see in academic institutions.</p><p><span>A full scientific career these days is a bit of a cacophony. It starts with doing a lot of what is essentially grunt work in a lab or on a computer. Slowly, one moves up the ladder and gains more independence. Postdoc is probably the stage that maps best to what people usually imagine when they think of a scientist: that’s when one is fully in charge of their projects, but also spends their day-to-day doing actual scientific work. Ironically, it’s also the most precarious: postdocs are often in their 30s, jumping between relatively  short term contracts. The way out of this is to become a PI, or Principal Investigator. In 2011, the average age at which a biomedical scientist gets their first R01 grant to establish their independent career as a </span><a href="https://drugmonkey.wordpress.com/2012/02/14/updating-the-age-of-first-nih-r01-award-trends-flatlining/" rel="">PI is 42</a><span>, having increased from 36 in the 80s. It has probably increased since then. As a PI, interpersonal skills become more and more important: one has to forge collaborations, write and get grants, take care of the fragile mental health of confused PhD students so they can produce work and so on. The skills required to be a successful PhD student and postdoc are in many ways very different from those required to be a good PI, almost as if they were different careers.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png" width="1456" height="957" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:957,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:516701,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8929f743-7b0a-44aa-bae4-0da87d57070d_2298x1510.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Age at first R01 grant </figcaption></figure></div><p><span>It’s at this young PI stage that Karikó ’s career hit a wall: after she became an Adjunct Professor, she stopped advancing further. Some of it was because of the topic she had chosen and in this regard, diversifying funding and supporting more high risk projects are very good proposals coming from the metascience community that would have helped. But some of it was probably her personality, as she says herself. I suspect selection against Weird Nerds has actually amplified since Karikó ’s time in academia: everything from ever larger collaborations in Biology, to longer times to becoming independent or increase in admin points in that direction. Indeed, as </span><a href="https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/the-flight-of-the-weird-nerd-from" rel="">I have argued</a><span> before, there is some quantitative evidence there are less Weird Nerds in STEM academia than there used to be.</span></p><p>So far I have discussed the Hard Sciences, but there is a case to be made that the problem is much more acute in less quantifiable fields like Humanities or Social Sciences. STEM has a higher barrier to entry: there is only so much political game playing that one can do in order to advance themselves if one cannot perform experiments in a lab. It is also somewhat more clear if a scientific piece of work is completely bad. There is feedback from industry, with most start-ups in biotech these days coming out of academic labs: this provides a strong incentive for innovation. Such quality check mechanisms are on much more shaky ground in fields like Humanities, where feedback from society can happen on the order of decades. Arguably, being a Weird Nerd that is intrinsically driven by the truth as opposed to what’s fashionable is even more crucial in the absence of hard metrics that can tell one their work is wrong. </p><p><span>But backlash from society does eventually happen, and I think we are in the middle of this right now, with trust in academia </span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/508352/americans-confidence-higher-education-down-sharply.aspx" rel="">plummeting in a bipartisan fashion</a><span>, as recent Gallup polls show. At least some of the current crisis is, in my opinion, down to academia essentially selecting against Weird Nerds types. A problem with non-STEM topics might sound less problematic than a replication crisis in cancer biology. I think that’s not true: after all, we depend on a collective imaginarium for a healthy society, a collective imaginarium whose pillars might be slowly crumbling.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-3836983834587188524" itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I can't remember how I first came across these near-ultrasonic 'beacons' ubiquitous in PA systems. I might have been scrolling through the audio spectrum while waiting for the underground train; or it might have been the screeching 'tinnitus-like' sensation I would often get near the loudspeakers at a local shopping centre.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-original-height="355" data-original-width="1040" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhCLaN93e4G6KQRBoHUTc1Kiuwi1OMfX8X0Xl4OljgQrQv8OE-IdQbyPUknY7fD0CznNyHvFlc8EXA4UqY7NxTULgdIaoSZK6dcvjIQafDNi60TW-At0leFRvWRaD863sEmuOoAyxYSSYcO7u5PZeNWXvuAAJCC7rmG981uV6jYiVSEfk6mvRHbPQTaZTFd/s520/pilots.png" srcset="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhCLaN93e4G6KQRBoHUTc1Kiuwi1OMfX8X0Xl4OljgQrQv8OE-IdQbyPUknY7fD0CznNyHvFlc8EXA4UqY7NxTULgdIaoSZK6dcvjIQafDNi60TW-At0leFRvWRaD863sEmuOoAyxYSSYcO7u5PZeNWXvuAAJCC7rmG981uV6jYiVSEfk6mvRHbPQTaZTFd/s1040/pilots.png 2x" width="520"></p>

<p>Whatever the case, I learned that they are called pilot tones. Many multi-loudspeaker PA systems (like the <a href="https://wiki.zenitel.com/wiki/VPA_-_Public_Address_Amplifiers#Speaker_line_fault_detection">Zenitel VPA</a> and <a href="https://axystunnel.com/en/products/end-of-line-detection-eol">Axys End of Line detection unit</a>) employ these roughly 20-kilohertz tones to continuously measure the system's health status: no pilot tone means no connection to a loudspeaker. It's usually set to a very high frequency, inaudible to humans, to avoid disturbing customers.</p>

<p>However, these tones are powerful and some people will still hear them, especially if the frequency gets below 20 kHz. There is one such system at 19.595 kHz in my city; it's marked green in the graph above. I've heard of several other people that also hear the sound. I don't believe it to be a sonic weapon like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mosquito">The Mosquito</a>; those use even lower frequencies, down to 17 kHz. It's probably just a misconfiguration that was never fixed because the people working on it couldn't experientially confirm any issue with it.</p>

<h3>Hidden modulation.</h3>

<p>Pretty quickly it became apparent that this sound is almost never a pure tone. Some kind of modulation can always be seen wiggling around it in the spectrogram. Is it caused by the background music being played through the PA system? Is it carrying some information? Or is it something else altogether?</p>

<p>I've found at least one place where the tone appears to be amplitude modulated by the lowest frequencies in the music or commercials playing. It's probably a side effect of some kind of distortion.</p>

<p>Here's a spectrogram plot of this amplitude modulation around the strong pilot tone. It's colour-coded so that the purple colour is coming from the right microphone channel and green from the left. I'm not quite sure what the other purple horizontal stripes are here.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-original-height="406" data-original-width="597" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg-_T-Ac5llsRcSWkgbsql-M4SF5kKSWCvDIq1IU7EalUEF91fpCK8dkKArMjo-WCfzt3rAfmTy-XD0IVOBJR9qOcbPPLO6RnJ0K16IHwK_w1vheTbVVzXG9LNhNAlSTCNJaqQ0PG93FqgxqJfnVdPxihg3dxgB7SWrv__ry7GsZjdfnRSG-AQTL8pYZUtG/s520/pilot_modulation.jpg" width="520"></p>

<p>But this kind of modulation is rare. It's more common to see the tone change in response to things happening around you, like people moving about. More on that in the following.</p>

<h3>Doppler-shifted backscatter.</h3>

<p>Look what happens to the pilot tone when a train arrives at an underground station:</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSd5MGkEHuqMDmuszJNqDgQ2dRl3cnYHFqr5KnUYCK43dQFJuQa0rYiPMPOyrn9lt11UfRjzfwfGw5SEUQv9wmNPRkZ56li-bau7tgmifno7wDhxxMvdt0-_II4CWhS_OpHqw8LyY9RTpqh4pWRVwthlXgd6kXRwap4yAPGlXbtRGM4NWnD2Xgx99gGIVI/s681/metro-doppler.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="526" data-original-width="681" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSd5MGkEHuqMDmuszJNqDgQ2dRl3cnYHFqr5KnUYCK43dQFJuQa0rYiPMPOyrn9lt11UfRjzfwfGw5SEUQv9wmNPRkZ56li-bau7tgmifno7wDhxxMvdt0-_II4CWhS_OpHqw8LyY9RTpqh4pWRVwthlXgd6kXRwap4yAPGlXbtRGM4NWnD2Xgx99gGIVI/s520/metro-doppler.jpg" width="520"></a></p>

<p>The wideband screech in the beginning is followed by this interesting tornado-shaped pattern that seems to have a lot of structure inside of it. It lasts for 15 seconds, until the train comes to a stop.</p>

<p>It's my belief that this is backscatter, also known as reverb, from the pilot tone reflecting off the slowing train and getting Doppler-shifted on the way. The pilot tone works as a continuously-transmitting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bistatic_sonar">bistatic sonar</a>. Here, the left microphone (green) hears a mostly negative Doppler shift whereas the right channel (purple) hears a positive one, as the train is passing us from right to left. An anti-aliasing filter has darkened the higher frequencies as I wasn't yet aware I would find something interesting up here when recording.</p>

<p>A zoomed-in view of this cone reveals these repeating sweeps from positive to negative and red to green. Are they reflections off of some repeating structure in the passing train? The short horizontal bursts of constant tone could then be surfaces that are angled in a different direction than the rest of the train. Or perhaps this repetition reflects the regular placement of loudspeakers around the station?</p>

<p><img alt="" data-original-height="574" data-original-width="1356" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgIpMblTl7xXcQEPtN2gOGfa_EDP2KZJCikptc6K3crsBYg9p5H3Ua_z-qUXmXEEJvHiW1Sy4-wBWVYZwSPz1kaezgqgSaCqUjZhyphenhyphenPKFOAeL99kgdY6NW8M0FEmE2ErVQLAcpzcPm9UQXWM3uCEozlvoIIasHP6LfRA4sDCM_kXc-7q1k8TIlUfDKoleVrF/s520/metro-doppler-2.jpg" srcset="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgIpMblTl7xXcQEPtN2gOGfa_EDP2KZJCikptc6K3crsBYg9p5H3Ua_z-qUXmXEEJvHiW1Sy4-wBWVYZwSPz1kaezgqgSaCqUjZhyphenhyphenPKFOAeL99kgdY6NW8M0FEmE2ErVQLAcpzcPm9UQXWM3uCEozlvoIIasHP6LfRA4sDCM_kXc-7q1k8TIlUfDKoleVrF/s1040/metro-doppler-2.jpg 2x" width="520"></p>

<h3>Moving the microphone.</h3>

<p>Another interesting experiment: I took the lift to another floor and recorded the ride from inside the lift. It wasn't the metal box type, the walls were made of glass, so I thought the pilot tone should be at least somewhat audible inside. Here's what I got during the 10-second ride. It's a little buried in noise.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-original-height="260" data-original-width="567" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_0XjZC3uU7NrdCj3qXOspv4F11P_c1oNm-TGuo-oC_fGRxSQpazMgTKxn2_jlv9dMpSGMuy35kmBqEFKyJSZAcmkaC0blyshTYSSdeORjtFXiY3bDg2ahuctUkXzJw2PV_Mjrm_273hpl6HrTa4r7wGo2J0Nfn-o_-vClCx6q2PVyiUcvUuvHxGOkpyMf/s520/hissi.jpg" width="520"></p>

<h3>Scooter calculation.</h3>

<p>For the next experiment I went into the underground car park of a shopping centre. I stood right under a PA loudspeaker and recorded a person on a scooter passing by. A lot of interesting stuff is happening in this stereo spectrogram!</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhd8dFTuxIGzjNucYd5NajbKS6-G3bBQywiSqN4LKMhUVkHyN7ZiOdWBqBPi7tr-0oWFMh-Pl-8TX_fbcNGJe2aw8_mEZ5S-tF-9UAUk7zulsUuW018fXjHQq40b39DZACbHKvx3xdfbaXhCAHUS3oY4ESKZPJqLO_R1S_D6iVxfxsMCNsfVoxMI5XxItpC/s670/skede-doppler.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="500" data-original-width="670" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhd8dFTuxIGzjNucYd5NajbKS6-G3bBQywiSqN4LKMhUVkHyN7ZiOdWBqBPi7tr-0oWFMh-Pl-8TX_fbcNGJe2aw8_mEZ5S-tF-9UAUk7zulsUuW018fXjHQq40b39DZACbHKvx3xdfbaXhCAHUS3oY4ESKZPJqLO_R1S_D6iVxfxsMCNsfVoxMI5XxItpC/s520/skede-doppler.jpg" width="520"></a></p>

<p>First of all, there seems to be two pilot tones, one at 19,595 Hz and a much quieter one at 19,500 Hz. Are there two different PA systems in the car park?</p>

<p>Second, there's a clear Doppler shift in the reverb. The frequency shift goes from positive to negative at the same moment that the scooter passes us, seen as the wideband wheel noise changing color. It looks like the pattern is also 'filled in' with noise under this Doppler curve. What all information can we find out just by looking at this image?</p>

<p>If we ignore the fact that this is actually a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bistatic_radar#Doppler_shift">bistatic doppler shift</a> we could try and estimate the speed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_radar#Frequency_variation">a formula on Wikipedia</a>. It was pretty chilly in the car park, I would say 15 °C. The speed of sound at 15 °C is 340 m/s. The maximum Doppler shift here seems to be 350 Hz. Plugging all these into the equation we get 11 km/h, which sounds like a realistic speed for a scooter.</p>

<p>Why is it filled in? My thought is these are reflections off different points on our test subject. There's variation in the reflection angles and, consequently, magnitudes of the velocity component that causes frequency shifting, down to nearly zero Hz.</p>

<h3>What now?</h3>

<p>What would you do with this ultrasonic beep all around you? I have some free ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automated speed trap in the car park</li>
  <li>Detect when the escalators stop working</li>
  <li>Modulate it with a positioning code to prevent people getting lost in the maze of commerce</li>
  <li>Use it to deliver ads somehow</li>
  <li>Use it to find your way to the quietest spots in a shopping centre</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>Today I want to start with a comment by a colleague, Texas antitrust lawyer Basel Musharbash, observing a restaurant trying to do a renovation in Dallas. “Something funky is happening in the building materials supply chain,” he </span><a href="https://twitter.com/musharbash_b/status/1790487013239447927" rel="">wrote</a><span> . “A 3,000 sq. ft. commercial space in a strip mall shouldn’t cost $720,000 to renovate into an Italian food joint.” He’s right. It shouldn’t. And yet it does.</span></p><p>This attitude of ‘something is very wrong with our society’ is everywhere now. Corporate procurement officers just assume costs are going up, it’s in budget projections for the Defense Department, and we expect cost overruns on everything. ‘Inflation’ is now a catch-all for a basic view that stuff is just going to suck more and more. </p><p>So what’s going on? Today’s piece is about a concept I am going to call ‘economic termites,’ which are instances of monopolization big enough to make investors a huge amount of money, but not noticeable enough for most of us. An individual termite isn’t big enough to matter, but the existence of a termite is extremely bad news, because it means there are others. Add enough of them up, and you get our modern economic experience.</p><p>The concept of an economic termite is the cousin to Cory Doctorow’s ‘enshittification’ or Yves Smith’s ‘crapification,’ terms that describe how a platform gradually degrades the quality of its service as it gains market power and gets pushed to extract cash by financiers. Economic termites describes where these same forces get into the mostly unseen business foundations of our society and profiteer.</p><p>These termites are in the infrastructure or guts of business, like recruiting services, construction equipment or software, the industrial gasses that go into chemicals and electronics, and so forth. It’s the stuff you don’t see that makes our world turn, there’s fortunes to be made, and bottlenecks to foster.</p><p>They also explain a dynamic we all face, a profound wariness in our society, a sense that stuff just costs more and is more difficult, for no discernible reason. Added up, these end up sapping our faith in the American system, because they make what seem like simple problems become not just unsolvable, but not even capable of being diagnosed. In this issue, I’ll cover some of the companies you don’t realize are gnawing at the foundation of our society - Verisign, Autodesk, Linde, Assa Abloy, Gracenote, and LinkedIn. And yes, there are legal tools to address them. But first we have to realize that these bottlenecks are everywhere. </p><p>We’ll start with a corporation I pay to host this newsletter.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg" width="1200" height="900" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:900,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;The secret ingredient is crime : r/MitchellAndWebb&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="The secret ingredient is crime : r/MitchellAndWebb" title="The secret ingredient is crime : r/MitchellAndWebb" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7dc0adfe-d2c2-43d7-9ee0-35bb86edc8be_1200x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>A few months ago, Verisign - which is the government-designated monopolist that runs the registration of .com addresses - announced </span><a href="https://domainnamewire.com/2024/02/08/verisign-announces-com-price-hike-to-10-26/" rel="">a price hike</a><span>, from $9.59 per year for .com addresses to $10.26. If you’ve ever bought or renewed a website, Verisign has gotten some of your money. I have to pay this fee to register TheBigNewsletter.com domain name, every year. So does everyone else who has a domain name.</span></p><p>An increase of less than a dollar a year is not a big deal. But over the decades, these price hikes have been routine. A few years ago, the price to renew a .com domain was $6 a year. Then $7. Then $8. Verisign has hiked prices every year, up to the maximum set by the government (until Trump removed the price cap altogether in 2018.)</p><p>Today, Verisign is the single most profitable company in the stock market, a great example of an economic termite. In 2013, its operating margins were 54.7%, by 2023 they grew to a crazy 67.1%. Verisign doesn’t invest this money; in 2023, it spent $882 million of it on stock buybacks. Its expenses are basically running a simple database, its strategy is to hike prices just below what will be noticed, and its method is to have politically connected people like Clinton Justice Department official Jamie Gorelick - who is one of Merrick Garland’s good friends - on its board.</p><p>Where did Verisign’s monopoly come from? Well, it was due to the last four administrations choosing to ‘privatize’ domain registration to a ‘multi-stakeholder group,’ the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which has a deal with Verisign to allow it to maintain the monopoly. ICAAN could at any point put the contract out on domain management for bid, and you’d see corporations come in at $2/year, certainly much less than $10.26. But they haven’t ever done that. Their contract strikes me as unlawful, a straightforward agreement in ‘restraint of trade.’ Yet, Verisign has a weird agreement with U.S. government’s National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA), which is widely perceived to provide the firm with legal cover for its clearly monopolistic behavior. </p><p>In less than three months, the NTIA, which is run by former Google lobbyist Alan Davidson, has a choice of whether to renew its agreement with Verisign. I don’t know what Davidson will decide. He might not perceive it as worth his time to fight with this economic termite. But he should, because termites are a bad sign.</p><p>Also, I want my money back!</p><p>Talk to anyone in architecture or engineering design for big construction projects, and it’s not hard to find complaints about software provider Autodesk, which sits in the computer aided design (CAD) space. “I have personally been bullied by Autodesk while CTO at a design firm using predatory practices that dictated pricing unlike any software contract I've negotiated in my 30 year career,” one BIG reader wrote me. “I continue to hear stories from all leaders in the industry with aspirations to create a sustainable, human centered built environment, but limited by pricing and poor quality of a single tool (Autodesk).”</p><p><span>Autodesk is the classic economic termite. As one Wall Street analyst </span><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4632529-autodesk-q2-earnings-pricing-power-continue-sustain-growth-near-term" rel="">put it</a><span> in praising the stock, “Like other software suites providing extensive support for customer workflows, ADSK's offerings can demand premium prices due to their prevailing market dominance. When juxtaposed with the overall expenses of a </span><strong>construction project, which might reach millions of dollars, the cost of these products remains relatively minor</strong><span>.”</span></p><p><span>There are rivals in the market, but as another source noted, “The switching costs associated with CAD software are gargantuan, a reality incumbents leverage&nbsp;more&nbsp;or less mercilessly.” The result, he added, is that “there’s not all that much organic innovation in the past 25 years, but lots of steady growth.” Just going to Glassdoor, there are a </span><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Autodesk-Reviews-E1155.htm" rel="">large number of employee complaints</a><span> consistent with a firm that has market power, mostly about poor leadership and constant reorganizations due to acquisitions, but extending to unethical sales practices and a few claims of fraud. </span></p><p><span>In 2020, UK based architecture firms </span><a href="https://www.archpaper.com/2020/07/leading-architecture-firms-pen-open-letter-to-autodesk/" rel="">penned</a><span> an open letter to Autodesk complaining about high prices and poor innovation, “censuring the Silicon Valley-based design software and services giant for the mounting ownership costs—an increase as much as 70 percent over a five-year span through the end of 2019—of its central </span><a href="https://www.archpaper.com/tag/bim/" rel="">BIM</a><span> product, </span><a href="https://www.archpaper.com/tag/revit/" rel="">Revit</a><span>.” The software, they argued, has “remained mostly stagnant and that firms dependent on the aging software (it’s now 20 years old) have been faced with, among other things, ever-changing licensing models, aggressive sales tactics in enterprise licensing, and a lack of understanding of the business dynamics within the industry that the company serves.”</span></p><p><span>The likely reason for this market power is that Autodesk makes it hard to switch, both through technical means and aggressive sales tactics. As one customer said in the </span><a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/3ds-max-ideas/stop-being-an-abusive-monopoly/idi-p/10304199" rel="">Autodesk forums from</a><span> a few years ago, “The only feature request I’ll make is antitrust action against Autodesk.”</span></p><p>Generative AI might change the dynamic in the industry, but if there isn’t antitrust action, it will be deployed poorly.</p><p>In 2018, the second and third largest industrial gas companies, Linde and Praxair, combined to become the biggest firm in a very concentrated industry. Industrial gasses are chemicals, like oxygen, nitrogen and argon, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, helium, acetylene and specialty gases, that go into a ‘countless’ number of products, from MRI machines to frozen fish to semiconductors to steel to carbon capture and renewable energy. The Biden Inflation Reduction Act has supercharged the industry.</p><p><span>The merger was a controversial deal within the government, with the Trump Federal Trade Commission blessing the deal, though requiring the new firm to sell off some assets to a private equity joint venture. (FTC Commission Chopra </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1416947/1710068_praxair_linde_rc_statement.pdf" rel="">dissented</a><span> and opposed the merger.) </span></p><p><span>Immediately after the combination with Praxair, Linde announced substantial </span><a href="https://www.linde.com/news-and-media/2019/linde-announces-price-increases-effective-december-1-2019" rel="">price hikes</a><span>, and it has continued to increase prices ever since. In the last quarter of 2023, for instance, according to Linde’s investment documents, its sales in the U.S. </span><a href="https://www.linde.com/news-and-media/2024/linde-reports-full-year-and-fourth-quarter-2023-results" rel="">grew</a><span> by 6%, “driven by 5% higher pricing and 1% volumes.” And the root of its pricing power isn’t hidden; in 2022, its 10% boost in profit was, according to the </span><a href="https://assets.linde.com/-/media/global/corporate/corporate/documents/investors/full-year-financial-reports/2022-linde-annual-report-to-shareholders.pdf" rel="">corporation’s annual report</a><span>, “primarily due to higher pricing… driven by merger related assets.” Operating margins went from about 10% in 2019 to 16% in 2022 to 27.6% in 2023. In 2023, the company paid out 50% more to investors than it invested into the business.</span></p><p>Today, the industry is a lot like Verisign, on a larger scale. Industrial gases are essential to customers, but also an afterthought, because they are usually a small percentage of the customer’s cost. No one really cares if there are price hikes, as long as the gases are delivered. It’s also hard to switch, distribution is a bottleneck, and long-term supply contracts are common. The result, for Linde, is high operating margins, low investment, and lots of dividends and buybacks. There are a few other big companies in the market, like Air Liquide, but the merger cut price competition substantially. </p><p><span>Last year, Linde </span><a href="https://www.linde.com/news-and-media/2023/linde-buys-out-stake-in-one-of-the-largest-u-s-independent-packaged-gas-distributors" rel="">fortified</a><span> its position in distribution, buying one of the biggest packaged gas distributors in America, nexAir. And its executives have announced they are looking for ‘</span><a href="https://www.gasworld.com/story/linde-on-the-lookout-for-tuck-in-acquisitions/2138576.article/" rel="">tuck-in</a><span>’ acquisitions, meaning they want to keep buying mid-market firms as a consolidation play.</span></p><p>Unless you are buried in a supply chain somewhere, most people will never hear about the industrial gas price increase. But as with Verisign, a few pennies are coming out of your pocket every day because of this economic termite. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24cd4828-4a4a-4fe3-bfe4-cf416c9a0504_1524x758.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24cd4828-4a4a-4fe3-bfe4-cf416c9a0504_1524x758.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24cd4828-4a4a-4fe3-bfe4-cf416c9a0504_1524x758.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24cd4828-4a4a-4fe3-bfe4-cf416c9a0504_1524x758.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24cd4828-4a4a-4fe3-bfe4-cf416c9a0504_1524x758.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24cd4828-4a4a-4fe3-bfe4-cf416c9a0504_1524x758.png" width="1456" height="724" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/24cd4828-4a4a-4fe3-bfe4-cf416c9a0504_1524x758.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:724,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:640776,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24cd4828-4a4a-4fe3-bfe4-cf416c9a0504_1524x758.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24cd4828-4a4a-4fe3-bfe4-cf416c9a0504_1524x758.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24cd4828-4a4a-4fe3-bfe4-cf416c9a0504_1524x758.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24cd4828-4a4a-4fe3-bfe4-cf416c9a0504_1524x758.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Swedish conglomerate Assa Abloy makes locks and smart locks that go into a large percentage of residential and commercial buildings.

Another dime out of every viewer’s pocket.</p><p><span>Over the years, professional recruiters have been telling me about increasingly worse terms offered by LinkedIn. What’s the problem? Is LinkedIn really a monopoly? Well maybe not from a consumer’s perspective. But from the perspective of recruiting firms? That case is more compelling. “LinkedIn is the&nbsp;</span><em>only</em><span>&nbsp;dominant social professional network, with ~1 billion public resumés,” I was told. “They have no true competitors in ‘sourcing software’ for recruiters searching to attract passive job candidates for most all veins of corporate work.” There’s also direct evidence of market power. Earlier this year, LinkedIn imposed a 174% price increase on its customers, who are professional recruiters that scour the database for potential hiring. </span></p><p>And I looked into it, and yes, this one looks like a market power story. In fact, Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn and a big political donor, wrote a book called “Blitzscaling” in which he discussed the importance of getting big before anyone else. He used that recipe to build LinkedIn, the largest professional social media network, before selling it to Microsoft in 2017 for $26 billion. (Microsoft also owns GitHub, which is the other key place to source mid-career technical talent.)</p><p><span>There are a number of mechanisms LinkedIn uses to maintain its monopoly. The key is, as Google and Amazon do in their areas of network dominance, to </span><em>deny scale </em><span>to potential rivals. While most people think a LinkedIn profile is a public facing resume, in fact, Microsoft fiercely controls who can access that data in bulk, </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-supreme-court-revives-linkedin-bid-shield-personal-data-2021-06-14/" rel="">litigating</a><span> to deny the use of LinkedIn profiles to potential rivals, except for </span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/crowder-etal-linkedin-complaint.pdf" rel="">certain companies</a><span>, “such as Google,” which are whitelisted. Why would Google be allowed to search LinkedIn profiles? I’m guessing there’s a market allocation agreement. After all, it would seem pretty trivial for Google to launch a rival product, but it hasn’t. </span></p><p>Thousands of small agencies rely on LinkedIn, and have been gradually driven out of business as Microsoft, its owner, generates more revenue. These make it slightly more expensive to hire, an indirect tiny cost borne by everyone in the economy.</p><p>I could on, and I eventually will. (For instance, Waste Management is an obvious termite.) But you get the point. Small hidden tollbooths everywhere eventually foster economic tyranny.</p><p>Now of course it’s not all hidden. There are big monopolies in our economy. Live Nation/Ticketmaster, for instance, is likely responsible for big price increases in live entertainment, and UnitedHealth Group is driving up prices in health insurance. Oil price-fixing, rent price-fixing, and meat price-fixing are each individually a big deal. But the aggregate cost increases we’re seeing in random areas often can’t be traced to one big villain. But they can be traced to many small ones. </p><p>Where did these economic termites come from? We decided four and a half decades ago that monopolies were good. After 1998, the Antitrust Division stopped bringing monopolization cases, and in 2005, the Supreme Court unanimously endorsed monopolization as foundational to the health of American economy. After twenty years of not bringing cases, business executives realized the best way to run a business was to create a tollbooth in some mostly unnoticed part of society. So now, each supply chain is made up of a bunch of different bottlenecks, too small to notice.</p><p>That said, there are commonalities among these industries that make these problems easier to solve. Most of these firms use the tactic of building a network or standardizing a business on their platform, and then denying necessary scale to their rivals through technical, contractual, or business tactics. They often use exclusive contracts. They also often rely on expansive patent, copyright, or trademark claims, sometimes government sanctions for their market power. They are ‘capital light,’ usually in opposition to the new industrial policy goals of ‘bending metal.’ </p><p>As the big antitrust claims work through the courts, and as government policy design moves away from supporting consolidation, trends in business will change. Executives will get worried about being sued. Rivals will start calling lawyers, class action attorneys will see more opportunity, journalists will write more stories, and judges will learn. It’s becoming easier to see analogies and bring private cases. And over time, we’ll start to once again see these kinds of monopolization techniques as we do other moral wrongs based on unfairly exploiting power.</p><p><span>Thanks for reading!

<p>There were various arguments for the change:
</p>
<ul><li>All neighbouring countries drive on the right, including Norway and Finland, with which Sweden shares land borders, with five million vehicles crossing annually.<sup id="cite_ref-Réalités_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-Réalités-4">[4]</a></sup></li>
<li>Approximately 90 percent of Swedes drove left-hand drive vehicles,<sup id="cite_ref-Réalités_4-1"><a href="#cite_note-Réalités-4">[4]</a></sup> and this led to many head-on collisions when passing on narrow two-lane highways.<sup id="cite_ref-time1967_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-time1967-5">[5]</a></sup> City buses were among the very few vehicles that conformed to the normal opposite-steering wheel rule, being right-hand drive (RHD).<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>However, the change was unpopular; in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1955_Swedish_driving_side_referendum" title="1955 Swedish driving side referendum">1955 referendum</a>, 83 percent voted to keep driving on the left. Nevertheless, the Swedish Parliament approved Prime Minister <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tage_Erlander" title="Tage Erlander">Tage Erlander</a>'s proposal on 10 May 1963 of right-hand traffic beginning in 1967, as the number of cars on the road tripled from 500,000 to 1.5 million and was expected to reach 2.8 million by 1975.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> The Swedish Commission for the Introduction of Right-Hand Driving (<i>Statens högertrafikkommission</i>, HTK) was established to oversee the change.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> It also began implementing a four-year education programme on the advice of psychologists.<sup id="cite_ref-time1967_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-time1967-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>The public information campaign leading up to Dagen H included extensive advertising, road markings, and even distribution of reminder items like gloves and stickers to ensure everyone was aware of the change.
</p><p>The campaign included displaying the <i>Dagen H</i> logo on various commemorative items, including milk cartons and underwear.<sup id="cite_ref-time1967_5-2"><a href="#cite_note-time1967-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-hogertrafik_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-hogertrafik-9">[9]</a></sup> Swedish television held a contest for songs about the change, and the winning entry was "Håll dig till höger, Svensson" ('Keep to the right, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svensson" title="Svensson">Svensson</a>') written by <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressen" title="Expressen">Expressen</a></i> journalist Peter Himmelstrand<sup id="cite_ref-Expressen_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-Expressen-2">[2]</a></sup> and performed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_%C3%96sterdahl#The_Telstars" title="Marcus Österdahl">The Telstars</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>
</p><p>As <i>Dagen H</i> neared, every intersection was equipped with an extra set of poles and traffic signals wrapped in black plastic. Workers roamed the streets early in the morning on <i>Dagen H</i> to remove the plastic. A parallel set of lines was painted on the roads with white paint, then covered with black tape. Before <i>Dagen H</i>, Swedish roads had used yellow lines.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (September 2019)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Approximately 350,000 signs had to be removed or replaced, including some 20,000 in Stockholm alone.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>
</p><p>Vehicles had to have their original left-hand-traffic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp" title="Headlamp">headlamps</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-_and_right-hand_traffic#Headlamps_and_other_lighting_equipment" title="Left- and right-hand traffic">replaced</a> with right-traffic units. One of the reasons the Riksdag pushed ahead with Dagen H despite public unpopularity was that most vehicles in Sweden at the time used inexpensive, standard-size round headlamps, but the trend towards more expensive model-specific headlamps had begun in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Europe" title="Continental Europe">continental Europe</a> and was expected to spread through most other parts of the world. Further delay in changing over from left- to right-hand traffic would have greatly increased the cost burden to vehicle owners.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<p>On <i>Dagen H</i>, Sunday, 3 September 1967, all non-essential traffic was banned from the roads from 01:00 to 06:00. Any vehicles on the roads during that time had to come to a complete stop at 04:50, then carefully change to the right-hand side of the road and stop again (to give others time to switch sides of the road and avoid a head-on collision) before being allowed to proceed at 05:00. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm" title="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm%C3%B6" title="Malmö">Malmö</a>, however, the ban was longer&nbsp;– from 10:00 on Saturday until 15:00 on Sunday&nbsp;– to allow work crews to reconfigure intersections.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Certain other towns also saw an extended ban, from 15:00 on Saturday until 15:00 on Sunday.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

</p><p>One-way streets presented unique problems. Bus stops had to be constructed on the other side of the street. Intersections had to be reshaped to allow traffic to merge.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<p>The relatively smooth changeover saw a temporary reduction in the number of accidents.<sup id="cite_ref-Et_tu_13-0"><a href="#cite_note-Et_tu-13">[13]</a></sup> On the day of the change, only 157 minor accidents were reported, of which only 32 involved personal injuries, with only a low number being serious.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> On the Monday following <i>Dagen H</i>, there were 125 reported <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_accident" title="Traffic accident">traffic accidents</a>, compared to a range of 130 to 198 for previous Mondays, none of them fatal. Experts suggested that changing to driving on the right reduced accidents while overtaking, as people already drove left-hand drive vehicles, thereby having a better view of the road ahead; additionally, the change caused a marked surge in perceived risk that exceeded the actual level, and thus was followed by very cautious behaviour that caused a major decrease in road fatalities. Indeed, fatal car-to-car and car-to-pedestrian accidents dropped sharply as a result, and the number of motor insurance claims went down by 40%.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

</p><p>These initial improvements did not last, however. The number of motor insurance claims returned to "normal" over the next six weeks and, by 1969, the accident rates were back to the levels seen before the change.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

<p dir="auto">TL;DR:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="curl https://piku.github.io/get | sh"><pre>curl https://piku.github.io/get <span>|</span> sh</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">There are also <a href="https://piku.github.io/install" rel="nofollow">other installation methods</a> available, including <a href="https://github.com/piku/cloud-init"><code>cloud-init</code></a> and <a href="https://piku.github.io/install" rel="nofollow">manual installation</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Project Activity</h2><a id="user-content-project-activity" aria-label="Permalink: Project Activity" href="#project-activity"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong><code>piku</code> is considered STABLE</strong>. It is actively maintained, but "actively" here means the feature set is pretty much done, so it is only updated when new language runtimes are added or reproducible bugs crop up.</p>
<p dir="auto">It currently requires Python 3.7 or above, since even though 3.8+ is now the baseline Python 3 version in Ubuntu LTS 20.04 and Debian 11 has already moved on to 3.9, there are no substantial differences between those versions.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Motivation</h2><a id="user-content-motivation" aria-label="Permalink: Motivation" href="#motivation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We wanted an Heroku/CloudFoundry-like way to deploy stuff on a few <code>ARM</code> boards, but since <code>dokku</code> didn't work on <code>ARM</code> at the time and even <code>docker</code> can be overkill sometimes, a simpler solution was needed.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>piku</code> is currently able to deploy, manage and independently scale multiple applications per host on both ARM and Intel architectures, and works on any cloud provider (as well as bare metal) that can run Python, <code>nginx</code> and <code>uwsgi</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Workflow</h2><a id="user-content-workflow" aria-label="Permalink: Workflow" href="#workflow"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>piku</code> supports a Heroku-like workflow:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Create a <code>git</code> SSH remote pointing to your <code>piku</code> server with the app name as repo name:
<code>git remote add piku piku@yourserver:appname</code>.</li>
<li>Push your code: <code>git push piku master</code> (or if you want to push a different branch than the current one use <code>git push piku release-branch-name</code>).</li>
<li><code>piku</code> determines the runtime and installs the dependencies for your app (building whatever's required).
<ul dir="auto">
<li>For Python, it segregates each app's dependencies into a <code>virtualenv</code>.</li>
<li>For Go, it defines a separate <code>GOPATH</code> for each app.</li>
<li>For Node, it installs whatever is in <code>package.json</code> into <code>node_modules</code>.</li>
<li>For Java, it builds your app depending on either <code>pom.xml</code> or <code>build.gradle</code> file.</li>
<li>For Clojure, it can use either <code>leiningen</code> or the Clojure CLI and a <code>deps.edn</code> file.</li>
<li>For Ruby, it does <code>bundle install</code> of your gems in an isolated folder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It then looks at a <a href="https://piku.github.io/configuration/procfile.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Procfile</code></a> and starts the relevant workers using <code>uwsgi</code> as a generic process manager.</li>
<li>You can optionally also specify a <code>release</code> worker which is run once when the app is deployed.</li>
<li>You can then remotely change application settings (<code>config:set</code>) or scale up/down worker processes (<code>ps:scale</code>).</li>
<li>You can also bake application and <code>nginx</code> settings into an <a href="https://piku.github.io/configuration/env.html" rel="nofollow"><code>ENV</code></a> file.
You can also deploy a <code>gh-pages</code> style static site using a <code>static</code> worker type, with the root path as the argument, and run a <code>release</code> task to do some processing on the server after <code>git push</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Virtual Hosts and SSL</h3><a id="user-content-virtual-hosts-and-ssl" aria-label="Permalink: Virtual Hosts and SSL" href="#virtual-hosts-and-ssl"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>piku</code> has full virtual host support - i.e., you can host multiple apps on the same VPS and use DNS aliases to access them via different hostnames.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>piku</code>  will also set up either a private certificate or obtain one via <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" rel="nofollow">Let's Encrypt</a> to enable SSL.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you are on a LAN and are accessing <code>piku</code> from macOS/iOS/Linux clients, you can try using <a href="https://github.com/piku/avahi-aliases"><code>piku/avahi-aliases</code></a> to announce different hosts for the same IP address via Avahi/mDNS/Bonjour.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Caching and Static Paths</h3><a id="user-content-caching-and-static-paths" aria-label="Permalink: Caching and Static Paths" href="#caching-and-static-paths"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Besides static sites, <code>piku</code> also supports directly mapping specific URL prefixes to filesystem paths (to serve static assets) or caching back-end responses (to remove load from applications).</p>
<p dir="auto">These features are configured by setting appropriate values in the <a href="https://piku.github.io/configuration/env.html" rel="nofollow"><code>ENV</code></a> file.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Supported Platforms</h3><a id="user-content-supported-platforms" aria-label="Permalink: Supported Platforms" href="#supported-platforms"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>piku</code> is intended to work in any POSIX-like environment where you have Python, <code>nginx</code>, <code>uwsgi</code> and SSH: it has been deployed on Linux, FreeBSD, <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" rel="nofollow">Cygwin</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux" rel="nofollow">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">As a baseline, it began its development on an original 256MB Rasbperry Pi Model B, and still runs reliably on it.</p>
<p dir="auto">But its main use is as a micro-PaaS to run applications on cloud servers with both Intel and ARM CPUs, with Debian and Ubuntu Linux as target platforms.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Supported Runtimes</h3><a id="user-content-supported-runtimes" aria-label="Permalink: Supported Runtimes" href="#supported-runtimes"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>piku</code> currently supports apps written in Python, Node, Clojure, Java and a few other languages (like Go) in the works.</p>
<p dir="auto">But as a general rule, if it can be invoked from a shell, it can be run inside <code>piku</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Core values</h3><a id="user-content-core-values" aria-label="Permalink: Core values" href="#core-values"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Run on low end devices.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>What follows is the story of how I fixed not one, but two, different flawed Altera USB Blaster clone devices that never worked correctly after I bought them.</p>



<p>I recently built a few <a href="https://github.com/citrus3000psi/Time-Sleuth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Time Sleuths for HDMI input lag testing</a>. Time Sleuth is a neat little open-source project that allows you to measure the time it takes for your TV or monitor to display an image. The way it works is an Altera/Intel MAX 10 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FPGA</a> creates a video signal that is mostly a black screen with some blinking white boxes. It feeds the image off to a <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/TFP410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TI TFP410 DVI transmitter</a>, and also looks for a pulse on a photodetector. It measures the difference in time between when the white box blinked on and the photodetector saw it, and displays it as a number on its generated video signal with some min/max/average stats. Pretty cool! If you’re not into soldering, you can also buy them fully assembled.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/timesleuth.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="594" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/timesleuth-1024x594.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/timesleuth-1024x594.png 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/timesleuth-300x174.png 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/timesleuth-768x445.png 768w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/timesleuth-1536x891.png 1536w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/timesleuth.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Anyway, after soldering up a board, I had to flash a bitstream to the Altera FPGA. I immediately discovered that the <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/intel/PL-USB-BLASTER-RCN/1212940" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Altera/Intel USB Blaster</a> JTAG cable costs $300. I wasn’t willing to fork up that much money for a programmer I would potentially never use again, and I noticed that there are a lot of cheap clones out there, so I did some research and decided on a clone to buy.</p>



<p>I read many good things about the <a href="https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&amp;No=46" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&amp;No=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terasic USB Blaster</a>, but I thought that $69 was still a little on the high side for pricing, so I went for something even cheaper. In hindsight, I was completely wrong. $69 is very reasonable for a reputable product. The Terasic programmer would have been the best choice and would have avoided the mess I’m about to describe, so keep that in mind if you’re reading this and trying to decide on a programming cable to buy.</p>



<p>I opted for the <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/USB_Blaster_V2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Waveshare USB Blaster V2</a>. Waveshare’s site seemed pretty nice, and I saw <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/12esbhk/noob_need_some_help/jfdnkgn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at least one pretty good recommendation of it</a> on Reddit. I did notice an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/review/RK7T655J6OD87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon review that said it works intermittently in Linux</a>, but I bought it despite the warning. Worst case, I could use Windows instead.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/USB-Blaster-V2_l.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="225" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/USB-Blaster-V2_l.jpg" alt=""></a></figure>



<p>Well, it turns out that one-star review was spot on. I would even say that it was overly optimistic when describing the Linux compatibility. I couldn’t get the freaking thing to ever program an FPGA correctly <em>at all</em> in Linux, at least with Quartus Programmer or the related command line tools. It would fail during random parts of the programming process. Erases actually did work sometimes, but the longer the operation it was being asked to perform, the more likely it would fail. It was scary because I was starting to think I had made a mistake when building my first Time Sleuth, but then I fired up my Windows 10 VM and it programmed perfectly on the first try. I’ve confirmed that it always works fine in Windows.</p>



<p>I will say that I was able to get it to work with OpenOCD and UrJTAG by playing back an SVF file, but it was really slow and it felt clunky. I wanted something compatible with Quartus Programmer! I asked Waveshare about getting it to work in Linux, and this is what they said two days later:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m sorry that we did not test it with the Linux PC, it should have compatibility problem.</p>



<p>It is recommended to use in Windows PC.</p>

<p>At this point, I cracked it open to take a look. It’s actually pretty nice.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/waveshare.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="624" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/waveshare-1024x624.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/waveshare-1024x624.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/waveshare-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/waveshare-768x468.jpg 768w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/waveshare-1536x935.jpg 1536w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/waveshare.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>It uses an FTDI FT245RL and an Altera EPM3064A CPLD, as well as a Nexperia 74LVC244A buffer. I have often seen people say that the FTDI + CPLD USB Blaster clones are typically higher quality than the really cheap clone devices out there. That’s because Altera’s actual USB Blaster (version 1, anyway) uses a similar setup internally. I’m not sure if it’s quite as nice as Altera’s design, but I like seeing the 74LVC244A buffer in there. As far as I can tell, it’s being used as a level shifter to ensure compatibility with different voltages, which is how Waveshare is able to say it supports 1.2V to 5V programming voltages. I’m not convinced that 5V programming voltage would actually be in spec with the 74LVC244A’s recommended supply voltage range of 1.2V to 3.6V, but I digress.</p>



<p>Why would a device like this work correctly in Windows but not Linux? The Altera software looked pretty similar between Windows and Linux. I’d be shocked if they weren’t using the same codebase underneath. This seemed like the perfect thing for me to investigate, especially since I have a <a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2023/08/building-alex-taradovs-open-source-usb-sniffer/" data-type="post" data-id="3382" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardware USB sniffer</a>. I looked at the raw USB traffic, although a hardware sniffer ended up being overkill for this. The traffic actually looked quite a bit different between Windows and Linux. I guess the Windows software assembles the JTAG commands slightly differently, and something about the way Windows does it works better with this device.</p>



<p>To limit the scope of what I was looking at, I decided to focus solely on Linux. Since I could get Linux to both succeed and fail during a short procedure like erasing the chip, I <a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/USB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used Wireshark to do a usbmon capture</a> of good and bad erases. Then I studied the captures in depth.</p>



<p>First, I needed to understand how the <a href="https://github.com/swetland/jtag/blob/master/usb-blaster-protocol.txt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USB Blaster works</a>. I also didn’t know much about JTAG, <a href="https://www.fpga4fun.com/JTAG.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so I read up on it</a>. The USB Blaster’s protocol is actually very simple. As a brief summary of the linked info, the host computer sends a bunch of bytes to the device. If the highest bit in a transmitted byte is 0, the rest of the bits contain raw state to put directly on the various JTAG pins, as well as controlling the status LED. If the highest bit is 1 instead, then the bottom 6 bits contain a length, and then there are that many bytes following that contain 8 bits that will be consecutively shifted out through TDI/TCK. So basically the byte mode is an optimized way to send data faster if you are aren’t needing to twiddle the other pins like TMS.</p>



<p>Bit 6 is used in both modes to tell the USB Blaster to also read data from the TDO pin and send it back to the computer. The USB Blaster sends out heartbeat packets every millisecond or so even if there’s no data that has been read since last time. The packets appear to always be prefixed with two bytes: 0x31 and 0x60. I’ve noticed that the Waveshare device sometimes sends “0x31 0x00” as the prefix instead, but I don’t think it matters.</p>



<p>Next, I read up on the linked JTAG documentation above. It explains how it’s a state machine and the TMS pin is used to decide how to jump around between the different states each time a TCK cycle occurs. It also provides some useful examples of how you can figure out what devices (if any) are present on the JTAG chain. I manually decoded the JTAG operations in the Wireshark USB captures. Here’s an example of a recorded packet sent to the Blaster:</p>



<pre>0000   7e 7f 7e 7f 7e 7f 7e 7f 7e 7f 7e 7f 7c 7d 7e 7f<br>0010   7c d0 ff 03 b3 3f fc ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff<br>0020   ff ff 7c 7d 7c 7d 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c<br>0030   7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c 7c</pre>



<p>And here’s the response that I got back from it:</p>



<pre>0000   31 60 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03<br>0010   03 03 03 77 43 60 0c fc 03 b3 3f fc ff ff ff ff<br>0020   ff ff ff 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03<br>0030   03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03</pre>



<p>You’ll notice that the response has one more byte than the transmission. Actually, it has one fewer byte, because the “31 60” prefix doesn’t count. The reason it has one fewer byte is because the transmitted “D0” byte has bit 7 set, so it’s indicating we’re going into byte mode for 16 bytes (the lower 6 bits are 0x10 = 16). That byte doesn’t actually perform any operation itself, so it doesn’t cause a response byte to be sent. But because bit 6 is set in it, all 16 bytes transmitted will have associated responses. They show up as the “77 43 60 … ff ff ff” in the response.</p>



<p>Going into the actual nitty-gritty detail of this transmission is well beyond the scope of this post, but what’s happening here is the Altera software is reading the IDCODE of the attached chip(s). It’s very hard to see in the hex dump because the bits aren’t on perfect byte boundaries, but the Altera CPLD responds with a chip ID of 0x031810DD, which is <a href="https://bsdl.info/details.htm?sid=c20a414e3d05113988ca59b002289d77" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exactly what the 10M02SCE144 is supposed to respond with</a>.</p>



<p>I kept following along in the USB/JTAG trace and eventually found a point where the data readback differed between the success and failure captures. The Altera software appeared to be attempting to enter the Shift-IR state, but the readback we got didn’t make sense after entering that state.</p>



<p>At this point I had no choice but to blame something in the adapter. It was returning different results when given the <em>exact</em> same input both times. It was random. It kind of seemed like it was probably something related to timing, like maybe it was right on the boundary of being out of spec on setup/hold times or something.</p>



<p>Here’s what the traffic looked like on an oscilloscope. In particular, this is what the optimized byte mode traffic looked like (TCK):</p>

<p>I did notice something a little funky with this. The pulses are 6.25 MHz. This makes sense because the oscillator is 25 MHz, so it’s being divided by 4. My understanding is designs like this, including the original USB Blaster, typically have a 6 MHz JTAG clock though. I began wondering if it’s slightly overclocked. I think that would explain intermittent behavior. I even found an <a href="https://www.edaboard.com/threads/usb-blaster-download-cable-design.35648/page-3#post-355972" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">old discussion from 2006</a> where “kawk”, who designed a CPLD bitstream for this setup, ran their design slightly overclocked at 25 MHz and it worked okay, but other people reported problems and had to slow it down.</p>



<p>This gave me an idea. The FTDI chip has its own internal oscillator, so I was totally free to mess around with the frequency that the CPLD was running at without interfering with any of the USB circuitry. I didn’t have any oscillators sitting around, but I did have an RPi Pico I could use. I wrote a simple program in MicroPython to set up GP0 as a 24 MHz clock signal with 50% duty cycle:</p>


<div><pre title="">from machine import Pin, PWM
pwm = PWM(Pin(0))
pwm.freq(24000000)
pwm.duty_u16(32768)
</pre></div>


<p>Then I removed the 25 MHz oscillator from the Waveshare Blaster and soldered a wire to the Pico’s GP0 instead (and another for ground).</p>

<p>When I verified the frequency with my multimeter, I discovered that the RP2040 was outputting a 25 MHz signal even though I had asked for 24 MHz. I quickly realized this is because the Pico is clocked at 125 MHz by default and the PWM frequencies would have to be an integer divisor of that. I probably could have changed the Pico’s frequency with machine.freq(), but it was easier to just keep stepping up the divider instead. (125/6) = 20.83 MHz, which is well below 24 MHz.</p>



<p>Running at 20.83 MHz, it still seemed erratic. So I bumped the clock speed down even more to (125/7) = 17.86 MHz. At this rate, it mostly worked! I did see it fail a few times though, so I figured I was getting closer to reliability. The next lowest possible frequency of (125/8) = 15.625 MHz seemed to be the sweet spot. It worked perfectly every time with that slower clock speed. Success!</p>



<p>I’m still waiting for a few random oscillators to arrive from Digi-Key so I can close this one out for good. I ordered them before I thought to try using an RP2040 as a stand-in, so the speeds I ordered were 24 MHz, 20 MHz, and 12 MHz. I wish I would have ordered a 15 or 16 MHz one as well. I’m feeling pretty confident that soldering in the 12 MHz one will solve everything and the Waveshare USB Blaster will work perfectly in Linux after that. Sure, it’ll slow everything down quite a bit, but at least it’ll be reliable.</p>



<p>I’m still kind of mystified that the problem never happens in Windows. I’m guessing the CPLD design has a subtle timing bug that the Windows version of Altera/Intel’s software doesn’t hit because it arranges the JTAG traffic in the USB packets completely differently.</p>



<p>Normally this would be the end of this type of blog post, but you may have noticed at the top that I mentioned I fixed two different USB Blaster clones. Buckle up, because we’re just getting started. After the Waveshare one didn’t work, and before I figured out what was really going on, I bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F5H5LPZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an even cheaper one on Amazon for $9</a>.</p>

<p>I didn’t feel very optimistic about this based on the reviews. There were a lot of reviews that said it didn’t work at all. Several reviewers said it bluescreened their Windows computers. Despite those reviews, and given how much time I had invested into this problem, I thought it would be fun to see what was wrong with this cheapo clone. Am I crazy or something?</p>



<p>It arrived yesterday afternoon. I plugged it into my Linux machine and tried it out. Of course, it didn’t work. No surprises there. It showed up with the correct device ID and the software correctly recognized it, but Quartus Programmer didn’t like it at all.</p>



<pre>usb 3-2: New USB device found, idVendor=09fb, idProduct=6001, bcdDevice= 4.00<br>usb 3-2: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3<br>usb 3-2: Product: USB-Blaster<br>usb 3-2: Manufacturer: Altera<br>usb 3-2: SerialNumber: FFFFFFFF</pre>



<p>As far as I could tell based on a quick Wireshark USB capture, the traffic looked normal except for one thing. It wasn’t responding with any data. There were no response packets at all, not even the periodic idle “31 60” packets that should have been showing up.</p>



<p>Then I tried it in Windows and immediately replicated the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_screen_of_death" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BSOD</a> problem that other reviewers had mentioned. It quickly gave me a blue screen with the bug check being <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/bug-check-0x4e--pfn-list-corrupt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PFN_LIST_CORRUPT</a>. I didn’t even have enough time to open the Quartus Programmer software. Some quick Googling revealed that <a href="https://www.eevblog.com/forum/microcontrollers/quartus-usb-blaster-windows-10-blue-screen-of-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I wasn’t the only one experiencing this problem with cheap Altera USB Blaster clones</a>. Other people had solutions that often involved trying custom Windows drivers, but I didn’t really want to mess with that. I didn’t really care about Windows support anyway. It didn’t work in Linux and that was all that mattered to me.</p>



<p>So yeah, this clone seemed totally useless, just like most of the reviews had said. It’s interesting, because I’ve also seen a lot of people online say that the cheapo clones work great. I guess there must be different versions out there and some of them work better than others. I decided to open this one up and see what it looked like inside:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cheapointernals.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cheapointernals-1024x768.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cheapointernals-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cheapointernals-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cheapointernals-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cheapointernals-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cheapointernals.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>There is only a single chip, which isn’t identifiable in the picture. It’s a <a href="https://www.wch-ic.com/products/CH552.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WCH CH552G microcontroller</a>. This is one of those extremely inexpensive microcontrollers that was making its rounds on the Internet a few years ago. It’s an 8-bit 8051 MCU that has a fair amount of neat little features. It has crystal-less USB support, for example. As of this writing, LCSC has a few in stock for $0.62 each. Not bad for the capabilities it has. However, I think this board design is very basic and is a great example of how you get what you pay for. As far as I can tell, it’s hardwired for 3.3V operation. There are series resistors on each pin, so I don’t know if that helps with avoiding damage if you hook up a lower-voltage device or what.</p>



<p>I searched around to see if anyone else had encountered these chips in USB Blaster clones. I saw that many of the other cheap clones have STM32 or PIC microcontrollers. I guess the market has been flooded with different versions. Some of the people who say theirs work great must have gotten a different model, or at least different firmware on it.</p>



<p>I found a few mentions of the CH552G being used in these. One interesting thing was a <a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/04/30/the-cheapest-usb-blaster-ever-thanks-to-ch552/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hackaday post from a couple of months ago where someone else had developed one</a> (closed source), as well as <a href="https://github.com/VladimirDuan/CH55x-USB-Blaster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another project from 5 years ago with open-source firmware</a>, based on top of <a href="https://github.com/Blinkinlabs/ch554_sdcc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blinkinlabs’ CH55x SDCC SDK port</a>.</p>



<p>This seemed right up my alley! A new idea/challenge sprung to mind. Could I get the open-source firmware from 5 years ago compiled and working on this non-functional CH552G USB Blaster clone I just bought? Would it work properly in Linux and avoid the Windows blue screen of death? The Time Sleuth runs at 3.3V so it would be completely safe to try out.</p>



<p>Of course I couldn’t resist taking on such a challenge. So last night, I started on it. What better way to spend a Friday night? The first task was to determine the pin mappings using continuity mode on my multimeter. The board is so simple and the MCU is so small that it didn’t take long before I had the entire pinout I needed:</p>



<ul>
<li>Pin 1 – P3.2 – TMS</li>



<li>Pin 2 – P1.4 – NCS</li>



<li>Pin 3 – P1.5 – TDI</li>



<li>Pin 4 – P1.6 – TDO</li>



<li>Pin 5 – P1.7 – TCK</li>



<li>Pin 6 – ?</li>



<li>Pin 7 – ?</li>



<li>Pin 8 – ?</li>



<li>Pin 9 – P1.1 – ACTIVITY LED (ACT)</li>



<li>Pin 10 – P3.3 – ASDO</li>



<li>Pin 11 – P3.4 – NCE</li>



<li>Pin 12 – USB D+</li>



<li>Pin 13 – USB D-</li>



<li>Pin 14 – GND</li>



<li>Pin 15 – VCC</li>



<li>Pin 16 – V33</li>
</ul>



<p>Next, I got the CH55x SDK up and running. The documentation on <a href="https://github.com/Blinkinlabs/ch554_sdcc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the SDK’s GitHub project</a> was excellent. It didn’t take long before I was ready to try out a program to blink the activity LED on and off. I simply modified the “blink” example to use P1.1 instead of P1.7 and built it.</p>



<p>There are so many <a href="https://altbier.us/ch552g/Intro_to_the_CH552G_Microcontroller.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">awesome tutorials</a> out there about <a href="http://nerdralph.blogspot.com/2020/07/getting-started-with-wch-ch551-and-ch552.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to work with these chips</a>, so it wasn’t really a problem to figure out how to program it. I installed <a href="https://github.com/MarsTechHAN/ch552tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ch55xtool</a>. These chips are cool because they have a USB bootloader that puts it into a programming mode if you hold a pin high at startup. You don’t need a special programmer or anything. The datasheet says that you need to be running at 5V to flash them, but I’ve found so far that flashing works fine at 3.3V too. They do say you only get about 200 flash cycles per chip, so you can’t go crazy with reflash attempts. Oh well, they’re so inexpensive that it doesn’t matter that much.</p>



<p>To force it into the bootloader, I just held a wire between the 3V3 and D+ pins which were conveniently located on a header, plugged it in, and then quickly removed the wire to avoid shorting it for too long and also to allow USB communication to commence. A resistor would probably be safer.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gotobootloader.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="559" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gotobootloader.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gotobootloader.jpg 800w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gotobootloader-300x210.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gotobootloader-768x537.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></figure>



<p>Then it showed up as a different USB device in Linux, so I knew I had done something right:</p>



<pre>usb 3-1: new full-speed USB device number 69 using xhci_hcd<br>usb 3-1: New USB device found, idVendor=4348, idProduct=55e0, bcdDevice= 2.50<br>usb 3-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=0, Product=0, SerialNumber=0</pre>



<p>I briefly contemplated something in my head at this point: there was no going back as soon as I went any further. I’d erase the stock firmware on this device and my only hope would be to get this open-source firmware working. I didn’t care though. The device was useless with its original firmware so I had nothing to lose. Here’s the command I ran to flash the chip:</p>



<pre>ch55xtool -v -f blink.bin</pre>



<p>The flash was successful, but my blink test firmware didn’t freaking work! Nothing happened on the LED. I checked the other pins and there was no sign of life. I was pretty irritated. I really thought I had done my homework on this. I tried some other flashing utilities — even the vendor’s WCHISPTool in Windows. Nothing worked. I tried resetting all the config settings on the chip to default just in case one of the settings was screwed up, but nothing seemed to fix it. I started to worry that I had done all that reverse engineering work for nothing.</p>



<p>When I came to my senses after an hour or so, I realized I should start tinkering further with the sample code to see why it was failing. I noticed a call to CfgFsys() at the start of main(). I tried commenting it out, and all of a sudden the LED started blinking! (At the wrong rate, but that’s okay). Further reading in the datasheet revealed the problem as soon as I realized that CfgFsys() was writing to the CLOCK_CFG register. The SDK was defaulting to a FREQ_SYS of 24 MHz in examples/Makefile.include, but when the chip is running at 3.3V, it can only do a maximum of 16 MHz. I simply had to override FREQ_SYS to 16000000 or lower in my Makefile. Once I did that, the blinking LED demo worked and I was all set!</p>



<p>The next order of business was to get the open-source CH55x-USB-Blaster firmware compiling. The easiest thing to do was to drop it into the examples folder of the SDK as another example project. It was even including ../Makefile.include in its own Makefile, so I think that’s the CH55x-USB-Blaster developer’s intended way of integrating it. I <a href="https://github.com/dougg3/CH55x-USB-Blaster/commit/d3ee9694ce13e18fd72b074cd1ca554419bc3b45" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added the FREQ_SYS override to its Makefile</a>. <a href="https://github.com/dougg3/CH55x-USB-Blaster/commit/e65818660f527170f0e926454f282d3ca6b8ad8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I also modified the pin mappings</a>. They were mostly correct, but I had to <a href="https://github.com/dougg3/CH55x-USB-Blaster/commit/ac63de14ef77c883fbdc2b3dbcbc049814bd6150" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strip out a bootloader entry button</a> and move a couple of pins around. I also noticed the code was sending a prefix of “01 60” instead of “03 60” on transmitted packets so I went ahead and <a href="https://github.com/dougg3/CH55x-USB-Blaster/commit/02cb1c83d4d0d80e6b592d7be2e48f8ac3585808" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changed that to match the original USB Blaster</a>.</p>



<p>After I did that, I tried plugging it in…and nothing. Well, almost nothing. My computer detected a device plugged in, but nothing happened after that. In Wireshark it looked like a request for the device descriptor was being sent out, but nothing was happening in response.</p>

<p>Looking at the USB IRQ handler in the code, I was suspicious about the way the start-of-frame (SOF) interrupt was being handled. It didn’t look like the SOF interrupt was being cleared properly. I just disabled the SOF interrupt altogether for testing. It didn’t seem super important; it was just incrementing a counter which was later used to decide to send out an idle “03 60” packet every so often.</p>



<p>As soon as I disabled it, my reflashed USB Blaster clone sprang to life!</p>

<p>Amazingly enough, in this state, it worked completely fine in Linux. I had successfully fixed my $9 junk cheap USB Blaster to actually work correctly for flashing my Time Sleuth! I was totally stoked!</p>



<p>Then I plugged it into Windows to see if I had fixed the Windows compatibility, and it bluescreened right away. It was the exact same PFN_LIST_CORRUPT error as before.</p>



<p>What in the world? But it worked in Linux now! Why would Windows be upset?</p>



<p>I think what’s going on here is if your device pretends to be an FTDI chip, but it doesn’t perfectly emulate it, weird stuff happens when the official FTDI driver doesn’t see something it’s expecting. I’ll leave it to you as the reader to decide whether that’s accidental or intentional on FTDI’s part. Whether it’s accidental or not, I think it’s pretty bad that the driver can crash the system if the device doesn’t respond correctly. Anyway, I remembered that I had disabled the SOF interrupt that was part of the logic for how often to send out the empty “03 60” packets. I looked through some other code examples of how similar USB controllers handled SOF interrupts and <a href="https://github.com/dougg3/CH55x-USB-Blaster/commit/6d51e4f6a1cf70e09c318063828ff05ddbd9396e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweaked the firmware accordingly</a>.</p>



<p>With this change implemented, the SOF interrupt seems to work as intended now. I’m noticing periodic empty “03 60” packets when the programmer is in use now when I sniff the traffic in Linux, and Windows no longer crashes when it’s plugged in. I am successfully able to flash my Time Sleuths from Quartus Programmer in Linux and Windows with no problems.</p>



<p>After I got it fully working, I realized the activity LED was backwards. It was on most of the time and off when it was busy. I just had to <a href="https://github.com/dougg3/CH55x-USB-Blaster/commit/ab1b4f53fc5a0697ce7ef8396e13f90d8439df00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">invert the LED in the code</a>. It was a quick fix. The only other weird thing I’ve noticed is that the Time Sleuth backfeeds power into the cheap USB Blaster, so I just try to plug them both into power at about the same time to be safe. I don’t think there’s anything I can do in software to fix that.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/dougg3/CH55x-USB-Blaster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here’s my GitHub fork of the CH55x-USB-Blaster firmware</a>, along with a <a href="https://github.com/dougg3/CH55x-USB-Blaster/releases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release binary you can flash to your device</a> if you’ve somehow made the same mistake I did and bought a completely useless USB Blaster clone. Just keep in mind a few things: the circuit is very basic and only appears to be designed for 3.3V programming. This will only work if yours has the same pinout as mine. I take no responsibility if you brick your useless USB Blaster by trying this firmware out. I’ll take lots of credit if it fixes it though! Credit also goes to <a href="https://github.com/VladimirDuan/CH55x-USB-Blaster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VladimirDuan on GitHub for the original implementation of the CH55x USB Blaster firmware</a>, as well as <a href="https://github.com/Blinkinlabs/ch554_sdcc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blinkinlabs for the excellent SDK port</a>. Not to mention the developers of <a href="https://sdcc.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SDCC</a>! It’s awesome seeing so many open-source projects help breathe a solution like this to life.</p>



<p>Not too bad for a night’s work, huh? I converted a $9 piece of Amazon garbage into a functional USB Blaster clone in just a few hours. I’m pretty happy with myself! I don’t want to toot my own horn too much, but it seems kind of ridiculous that these junk devices are being sold totally nonfunctional, yet it only took me one evening to piece together some open-source firmware to fix it. Do they even test these things?</p>



<p>I’m also satisfied with my research into the first device I looked at, the Waveshare USB Blaster. I’m pretty sure as soon as I have a slower oscillator to solder in, it will also begin working perfectly, albeit slower than it potentially could be. It would really be cool to figure out how to make a new bitstream to load into it that could operate at the full 25 MHz original clock rate. I would probably need a bit of help on such a project though.</p>



<p>I hope this info is useful to someone out there!</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at \url{<a href="https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}.

    <p>Icebergs are less dense than water, so they always float with about 10% of their mass above the water. But which way up? An iceberg wouldn’t float <i>exactly</i> like on this page in reality. Its three-dimensional distribution of mass and its relative density compared to the water are both significant factors that are only approximated here.</p>
