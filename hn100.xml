                    <p>At long last, the <strong>first release of <span>GIMP</span> 3.0 is here</strong>! This is the end result of
seven years of hard work by volunteer developers, designers, artists, and community members (for reference, <span>GIMP</span> 2.10 was first <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2018/04/27/gimp-2-10-0-released/">published in 2018</a>

				<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Amazon is set to cut around 14,000 managerial positions by early 2025, aiming to save between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion annually. This reduction marks a 13% drop in Amazon’s global management workforce, shrinking the number of managers from 105,770 to 91,936.</p>
<p>This move follows <a href="https://techstartups.com/2025/01/30/amazon-lays-off-employees-in-communications-and-sustainability-units-in-latest-round-of-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent layoffs</a> in Amazon’s communications and sustainability units, as the company pushes to streamline operations and restructure teams.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-could-cut-managers-save-3-billion-analysts-2024-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business Insider</a>, the<span> job cut is part of</span> CEO Andy Jassy’s strategy to simplify decision-making and speed up processes. Last month, Jassy announced plans to boost the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. He emphasized that reducing managerial layers would streamline operations and enable Amazon to make faster decisions without getting bogged down by bureaucracy.</p>
<p>In a note released Thursday, Morgan Stanley projected that Amazon’s plan could cut around 13,834 managerial roles by early next year, saving the company between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion.&nbsp;The estimate is based on the assumption that managers make up 7% of Amazon’s workforce.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Morgan Stanley estimated that this effort could lead to the elimination of roughly 13,834 manager roles by early next year, resulting in cost savings of $2.1 billion to $3.6 billion,” Business Insider reported.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>As part of this plan, Amazon has launched a “bureaucracy tipline,” encouraging employees to flag inefficient procedures that slow down work. Managers have also been instructed to increase their direct reports, limit senior hires, and review pay structures to support the shift toward a leaner management model.</p>
<p>This layoff wave continues Amazon’s cost-cutting efforts that saw over 27,000 job cuts in 2022 and 2023. The company has also pulled back on projects that didn’t yield profits, including its “Try Before You Buy” clothing initiative and a speedy brick-and-mortar delivery service.</p>
<p>Amazon’s workforce saw significant growth during the pandemic, swelling to over 1.6 million by the end of 2021, up from 798,000 in late 2019. Although numbers have dipped since then, the company is still recalibrating its staffing needs.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Amazon mandated that corporate employees return to the office five days a week. Some staff were asked to relocate to designated office hubs, prompting some to leave rather than move.</p>
<p>Management restructuring is another key part of Jassy’s approach, with efforts to reduce layers between employees and leadership.</p>
<p>This move places Amazon alongside other tech companies trimming their workforce. Layoffs.FYI, a site tracking job cuts in tech, <a href="https://layoffs.fyi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that 81 tech companies have eliminated 22,692 jobs so far this year.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>This article looks at how different types of shoes can affect game development and examines how games deal with this in practice.</p>



<p>Before we dive in, let’s have a look what’s possible with high heels:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/realworld_01-1.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Sources: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-ymWhRhoQ2o" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-ymWhRhoQ2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@blumineck/video/7282440261223992609" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.tiktok.com/@blumineck/video/7282440261223992609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2DriKlNOJcc" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2DriKlNOJcc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#3</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/L-rvdMHA9ec" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/L-rvdMHA9ec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#4</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/79n-62kQttA" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/79n-62kQttA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#5</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Just in case I mess up the terminology, here is a little chart:</p>

<h2 id="height">Character Height</h2>







<p>Different character body sizes mean a lot of extra work for game developers. Here’s a great example for Dragons Dogma 2, where characters with different body sizes still manage to kiss:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ddogma_kiss_01.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: Dragons Dogma 2 Let’s Play <a href="https://youtu.be/4s31tU19dT8" data-type="link" data-id="https://youtu.be/4s31tU19dT8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1</a> &amp; <a href="https://youtu.be/LK44InP2Tdo" data-type="link" data-id="https://youtu.be/LK44InP2Tdo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Here we can see how the animation is adjusted so that the lips can meet. The camera also does a lot of work:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ddogma_kiss_02.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: Dragons Dogma 2 Let’s Play <a href="https://youtu.be/4s31tU19dT8" data-type="link" data-id="https://youtu.be/4s31tU19dT8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1</a> &amp; <a href="https://youtu.be/LK44InP2Tdo" data-type="link" data-id="https://youtu.be/LK44InP2Tdo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>But even if all characters have the <strong>same</strong> height, different shoes can influence the height of a character as well! This results in new bone positions, so that, for example, a finger no longer hits a button on the wall.</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/zombie_posture_plateau-1.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.mixamo.com/#/?page=1&amp;type=Character" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.mixamo.com/#/?page=1&amp;type=Character" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mixamo “Romero”</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Apart from precise interactions, there may be other special cases in which heels could lead to a problem: For example, you should be careful that heels do not give the player away behind cover:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/zombie_crouch_high_heels_compare.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.mixamo.com/#/?page=1&amp;type=Character" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.mixamo.com/#/?page=1&amp;type=Character" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mixamo “Romero”</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>If the character’s height changes, you may also need to update the <strong>hit collision volumes</strong> – especially in competitive games. This depends on how the engine handles such volumes. Better double-check!</p>



<p>Game developers are now on a cross road. Choose wisely!</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/meme_adjust.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="500" height="756" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/meme_adjust.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/meme_adjust.jpg 500w, https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/meme_adjust-198x300.jpg 198w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></figure></div>


<p>Let’s talk about option A first, where we adjust the height of the character correctly and realistically!</p>



<h2>💡 Solution A: “Adjust Height”</h2>



<p>There are three ways to deal with the consequences of the characters’ different shoe heights:</p>



<ol>
<li>Hope for the best</li>



<li>Fix Manually</li>



<li>Fix Dynamically</li>
</ol>



<h3>🙈 1. Hope for the best</h3>



<p>Some games can afford to adjust the character height because there are only <strong>few precise interactions</strong> with NPCs or the environment. When playing Infinity Nikki, for example, I mostly found animations where it doesn’t matter whether Nikki is 10cm taller or shorter (like opening a chest):</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nikki_open_chest.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/fr/p/infinity-nikki-71fc64" data-type="link" data-id="https://store.epicgames.com/fr/p/infinity-nikki-71fc64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Infinity Nikki</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>And I can’t remember any precise interaction in the cutscenes either (e.g. a handshake). So, raising the body is not much of an issue:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nikki_01.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/fr/p/infinity-nikki-71fc64" data-type="link" data-id="https://store.epicgames.com/fr/p/infinity-nikki-71fc64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Infinity Nikki</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, there is one exception: I have noticed a situation in which there is close interaction: Grooming. There are two outfits for this: one <strong>with</strong> and one <strong>without</strong> heels:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nikki_grooming.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/fr/p/infinity-nikki-71fc64" data-type="link" data-id="https://store.epicgames.com/fr/p/infinity-nikki-71fc64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Infinity Nikki</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>I think if I look <strong>very closely</strong>, I can see that there is a slight clipping problem with the animation with heels. Could be due to the different terrain though. I’m not sure, but it’s definitely not a big deal.</p>



<figure><a href="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nikki_grooming.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nikki_grooming-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nikki_grooming-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nikki_grooming-300x169.jpg 300w, https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nikki_grooming-768x432.jpg 768w, https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nikki_grooming-624x351.jpg 624w, https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nikki_grooming.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Saints Row is another game that correctly resizes the character, and it’s the only game I’ve stumbled across where you can wear heels as a <strong>male</strong> character:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/sr5.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/742420/Saints_Row/" data-type="link" data-id="https://store.steampowered.com/app/742420/Saints_Row/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saints Row</a></figcaption></figure>



<h3>💪 2. Manual Labor</h3>



<p>If the game needs it, animators could create unique animations (per shoe type) where e.g. the hand positions are corrected. They will love it!</p>

<p>But be careful! If not <strong>all animations</strong> are adapted, this can lead to problems. Here, for example, a specific golf animation only seems to be available for flat shoes:</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gtav_gold_high_heels.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-online" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA Online</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The same happens with the drinking animation (right), which only seems to be available for flat shoes. Special cases such as motorcycling also require special attention when heels are involved:</p>





<p>Here’s a closer look at what happens: The feet have to strike a different pose when high heels are worn (right). Otherwise it looks funny (left):</p>





<p>Incidentally, the same behavior can also be seen in Nikki for a <strong>single frame</strong> when the shoes are swapped. The shoe mesh is replaced one frame before the pose adjusts:</p>

<h3>⚙️ 3. Dynamic Systems</h3>



<p><strong>Manual adjustment</strong> is a lot of work! Isn’t there a way to automate this? For example, it would be a nightmare if you wanted to have a hand-holding mechanic and then you need tons of animations to make sure that the hands of characters with different shoe heights still meet precisely.</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/unreal_hand_holding.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://youtu.be/x8I2Xi8bRL8" data-type="link" data-id="https://youtu.be/x8I2Xi8bRL8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hand Holding Mechanics</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>IK to the rescue!</p>



<p>Modern engines offer real-time IK systems. Most players are already familiar with them, as these systems adapt the foot orientation to the terrain:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nikki_terrain_ik.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/fr/p/infinity-nikki-71fc64" data-type="link" data-id="https://store.epicgames.com/fr/p/infinity-nikki-71fc64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Infinity Nikki</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Such systems can also be used for atmospheric procedural animations such as touching a wall as you walk by:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/uncharted_wall_ik.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://youtu.be/dlQqiJYdyYM" data-type="link" data-id="https://youtu.be/dlQqiJYdyYM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iHeartGameDev | Uncharted</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Or, and this is particularly exciting for our topic, to dynamically adjust the hand position in the direction of a target, so that the character itself can have a different height and/or the target can be at a dynamic height in the level:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/unreal_example_ik.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: Unreal Content Examples: IK Rig</figcaption></figure>



<p>But be careful. If the IK target is not used correctly, you may end up with NSFW animations. You have been warned!</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fun_unreal_example_01.mp4" playsinline=""></video></figure>



<h2>💡 Solution B: “Find Workaround”</h2>



<p>Don’t want to manually adjust all animations or use a dynamic system? No problem!<br>Let’s take a look at some ways to equip characters with high heels <strong>without</strong> changing the actual body height to get around the things mentioned above.</p>



<p>Again, we have three options:</p>



<ol>
<li>Hide</li>



<li>Shorten</li>



<li>Bend</li>
</ol>



<h3>🙈 1. Hide!</h3>



<p>If the shoe allows it, you can “hide” your feet in the soles. This makes the leg look shorter (just like in the next section) but neither the leg nor the shoe needs to be altered:</p>





<h3>🦶 2. Shorten</h3>



<p>I have seen this solution <strong>very often</strong> in my research: The lower leg is simply shortened so as not to change the height of the character.</p>



<p>Here is an example in Sims 4, as you can see: The hip stays in place, the upper leg <strong>doesn’t</strong> change, but the lower leg is shortened (the angle is moved up):</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/sims4_kitchen-1.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1222670/The_Sims_4/" data-type="link" data-id="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1222670/The_Sims_4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sims 4</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Another example while seated:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/sims4_table-1.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1222670/The_Sims_4/" data-type="link" data-id="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1222670/The_Sims_4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sims 4</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The same in Watchdog Legions. However, the <strong>shape</strong> of the lower leg changes here as it is slightly compressed:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/watchdogs_comparison-1.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2239550/Watch_Dogs_Legion/" data-type="link" data-id="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2239550/Watch_Dogs_Legion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watchdog Legions</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>And another example, this time from Cyberpunk:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cyberpunk_01.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cyberpunk.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Normally the leg geometry is exchanged for a different one. Theoretically, <strong>blend shapes</strong> could also be used, but these are <strong>expensive</strong>.</p>



<p>⚠️ <strong>Important</strong>: Only the mesh changes, <strong>not</strong> the skeleton. This means that the ankle around which the foot rotates still has the same position:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/blender_ankle_demo-1.mp4" playsinline=""></video></figure>



<p>This can lead to strong visual distortions like in Final Fantasy 14:</p>





<p>In contrast, the ankle should be at this point when wearing high heels. Of course, you can never switch to flat shoes in Nier, so they could fit the skeleton perfectly:</p>





<h3>🦵 3. Bend</h3>



<p>Here’s a nice example where sychnorized character heights are very important (otherwise the lips wouldn’t meet when kissing), but <strong>instead</strong> of shortening the lower leg, the legs are simply <strong>bent</strong> a bit more:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/3dsv-1.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.thrixxx.com/games/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.thrixxx.com/games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3D Sex Villa 2</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="posture">Posture</h2>



<p>If you want to do it right, it’s <strong>not enough</strong> to just lift the hips and turn the feet into the “high heel” pose. According to <a href="https://www.oceansidepodiatrist.com/blog/item/1212-the-impact-of-high-heels-on-walking" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.oceansidepodiatrist.com/blog/item/1212-the-impact-of-high-heels-on-walking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this</a> and <a href="https://www.learningmethods.com/downloads/pdf/rossi--why.shoes.make.normal.gait.impossible.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.learningmethods.com/downloads/pdf/rossi--why.shoes.make.normal.gait.impossible.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article</a>, the whole posture changes! The main differences:</p>



<ul>
<li>redistribution of body weight</li>



<li>forward tilted pelvis, spine arches gently</li>



<li>engaged calf muscles</li>



<li>accentuated curve of the buttocks</li>
</ul>





<p>I tried to adapt this to my zombie by doing the following (I refrained from doing a blended shape for a fuller bum though):</p>



<ul>
<li>Raise the hips</li>



<li>Rotate the feet (so that they meet the floor again)</li>



<li>Redistribute the body weight by tilting the pelvis and arch the spine</li>
</ul>

<p>And I did a test with a walking animation. I added my posture change as an <strong>additive</strong> to a mixamo walking animation and it worked! Check out my sexy zombie :)</p>

<p>By the way #1, I noticed a little detail in Cyberpunk: when the shoe is swapped, we can briefly see how the foot pose changes:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cyberpunk_02.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cyberpunk.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>By the way #2: If you want to be really precise, you should also change the orientation of your big toe, as it is often squeezed unnaturally into the shoe:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/foot_in_high_heel.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://youtu.be/dq9oyn9OlgA" data-type="link" data-id="https://youtu.be/dq9oyn9OlgA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foot in High Heel Turntable</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="animation">Animation</h2>



<p>Apart from height and posture, you may also need to change the entire animation, as high heels can drastically alter the gait:</p>



<p><em><a href="https://www.oceansidepodiatrist.com/blog/item/1212-the-impact-of-high-heels-on-walking" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.oceansidepodiatrist.com/blog/item/1212-the-impact-of-high-heels-on-walking">“High heels encourage shorter, more deliberate strides, leading to a smoother and more controlled walking motion”</a></em></p>

They did a lot of motion capture analysis with 12 women:</p>





<p>And here we are at <strong>another</strong> cross road for game developers!</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/meme_unique_anims.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="756" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/meme_unique_anims.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/meme_unique_anims.jpg 500w, https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/meme_unique_anims-198x300.jpg 198w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></figure></div>


<p>If you’ve decided to reuse only the flat shoe animations, don’t sweat it! I’ll give you two reasons not to worry too much:</p>



<ol>
<li>Other developers do the same</li>



<li>Even in high heels a “normal” walk is possible</li>
</ol>



<h3>😊 1. Other developers do the same</h3>



<p>Most games simply reuse their animations. The only example I could find where <strong>custom animations</strong> are used is a Skyrim <strong>MOD</strong>! There, the animation of the high heels leads to a crossing of the legs and a more accentuated hip movement:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/skyrim_conditional_high_heel_walk-1.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75174" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75174" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Conditional High Heel Walk</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>And yes, it is true that such a gait can be observed in real life:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/walk_male_female.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2DriKlNOJcc" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2DriKlNOJcc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Who says men not walk in heels</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>But…</p>



<h3>👠 2. “Normal” Walk in High Heels</h3>



<p>Such a <strong>cross-over</strong> gait is also possible with <strong>FLAT shoes (left)</strong>, while a moderate cross-over (center) or no cross-over at all (right) is also possible with high heels:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/walk_female_high_heel_vs_flat.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/video/search/models/1058618608" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.shutterstock.com/video/search/models/1058618608" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shutterstock</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>So wearing high heels <strong>doesn’t</strong> mean that your legs <strong>automatically</strong> cross and your hips go crazy. But if that’s what you want and your game “only” offers flat shoes, you can still do it. Anything is possible!</p>



<p>By the way, not even Nikki has a unique animation per shoe and this game is all about outfits and dressing in style:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nikki_03.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/fr/p/infinity-nikki-71fc64" data-type="link" data-id="https://store.epicgames.com/fr/p/infinity-nikki-71fc64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Infinity Nikki</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>What they do have, however, are different idle animations. I counted <strong>four different</strong> ones, depending on which shoe you’re wearing. That’s quite a lot in my eyes:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nikki_02.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/fr/p/infinity-nikki-71fc64" data-type="link" data-id="https://store.epicgames.com/fr/p/infinity-nikki-71fc64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Infinity Nikki</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="clipping">Optimization</h2>



<p>What happens to the polygons of the leg when it is covered by a shoe? Good handling can help prevent clipping, and of course it’s a nice optimization. </p>



<p>This is what we want to prevent:</p>





<p>Some games hide the polygons inside shoes. In Saints Row, the legs are made up of different pieces and can be hidden if necessary:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/sr5_wireframe.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/742420/Saints_Row/" data-type="link" data-id="https://store.steampowered.com/app/742420/Saints_Row/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saints Row</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Watchdogs is also an interesting example:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Left</strong>: The whole leg is a <strong>single draw call</strong> and it is complete (the toes are there, even though they are covered by the shoe)</li>



<li><strong>Right</strong>: same location, only with a flat shoe. Now the leg is made up of <strong>multiple meshes</strong> (aka draw calls). I’m not sure why, as both shoes show about the same amount of skin…. strange! But in this case, the toes are optimized away!</li>
</ul>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/watchdogs_comparison_wireframe.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2239550/Watch_Dogs_Legion/" data-type="link" data-id="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2239550/Watch_Dogs_Legion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watchdog Legions</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Here is a static comparison of how the game handles the reduction of polygons:</p>



<ul>
<li>High Heels: Full leg (with toes) is used.</li>



<li>Flats: Leg made of several pieces; Toes are removed.</li>



<li>Boots: Leg made of several pieces; Lower leg removed.</li>
</ul>





<p>And cyberpunk? They just keep the whole leg, even if the boots are massive and cover most of it!</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cyberpunk_03.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cyberpunk.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="audio">Audio</h2>



<p>Depending on whether the shoe has a stiletto heel, the steps should sound different. The same applies if you are not wearing any shoes at all (barefoot). Cyberpunk does a good job here:</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cyberpunk_footstep_sound.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cyberpunk.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’re playing a <strong>competitive game</strong>, high heels might give away the player’s position more easily as they’re usually louder. This could be a balancing issue!</p>



<h2 id="bonus">Bonus Work</h2>



<p>You’ve already built high heels into your game, everything works perfectly and now you’re bored? Here are some challenges:</p>



<ul>
<li>Implement a real-time muscle simulation to fulfill this: <em><a href="https://www.oceansidepodiatrist.com/blog/item/1212-the-impact-of-high-heels-on-walking" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.oceansidepodiatrist.com/blog/item/1212-the-impact-of-high-heels-on-walking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“The lifted heel also engages the calf muscles and accentuates the curve of the buttocks […]”</a></em>.</li>



<li>If you do a life-simulation where people can get injuries, you can implement long-term side effects of wearing high heels like joint degeneration, shrinking calf muscles, nerve tissue thickening and many more (<a href="https://youtu.be/tyeIaTJ0IEE" data-type="link" data-id="https://youtu.be/tyeIaTJ0IEE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">source video</a>). Does Dwarf Fortress simulate this already?</li>



<li>Implement a “Sink into the ground” feature depending on the heel and soil type:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Implement a higher range and damage for fighters wearing high heels but also add a 5% chance that they slip and need a long pause to recover:</li>
</ul>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://simonschreibt.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/realworld_01_fight_and_fail.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/aj81fNQFYH0?si=SullodiHCRVwOput" data-type="link" data-id="https://youtube.com/shorts/aj81fNQFYH0?si=SullodiHCRVwOput" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/C-cqUj99zMI" data-type="link" data-id="https://youtu.be/C-cqUj99zMI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>



<ul>
<li>Supporting different shoe types may change the characters height and foot orientation (and maybe hit volumes).</li>



<li>If precise interaction with the environment or NPCs is necessary, the consequences for the height change require solutions (unique animations, IK systems) or workarounds (shorten lower legs, bent legs)</li>



<li>Different shoe types may also change the posture, gait and footstep sound (the latter could pose a balance problem in competitive games).</li>



<li>Many games use the same animation for all shoe types (but special cases such as motorcycling or sneaking with high heels may require special attention).</li>



<li>Sometimes the polygons that are covered by the shoe are removed for optimization (can also prevent clipping). Usually meshes are swapped as blend shapes are too expensive.</li>



<li>A graceful gait (crossed legs, accentuated hips) is also possible with flat shoes, while a “normal” gait is also possible with high heels.</li>
</ul>



<h2>History Lesson</h2>



<p>Originally, men started wearing high heels and then women adopted – <em><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21151350" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21151350" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“it was in an effort to masculinise their outfits”</a></em>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2><p>
I'm honored to appear in what I believe is the final series of these seminars. Most of my previous appearances have focused on debunking some conventional wisdom, and this one is no exception. My parting gift to you is to stop you wasting time and resources on yet another seductive but impractical idea — that the solution to storing archival data is quasi-immortal media. As usual, you don't have to take notes. The full text of my talk with the slides and links to the sources will go up on my blog shortly after the seminar.</p><h2>Backups</h2>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXKlNGhJKcHdX4_k6tqmciQHF7bSn3qg5ytFYOIkZhGgB-fsJC3G5qdJQA2Lfni9EsxDaM5s5CDDjPb3t1o6MqhTn2iY7nz3bsL_MDlIR6hX0PE25SbGdCVE7AFOaxe6nsaW2RxVWsUSeDb7mnrJF24Tz_nR-QPzwbuqV3rDcKFEz7BIV_EYKuJ4RZZk-k/s5184/Backups.JPG"><img data-original-height="5184" data-original-width="3888" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXKlNGhJKcHdX4_k6tqmciQHF7bSn3qg5ytFYOIkZhGgB-fsJC3G5qdJQA2Lfni9EsxDaM5s5CDDjPb3t1o6MqhTn2iY7nz3bsL_MDlIR6hX0PE25SbGdCVE7AFOaxe6nsaW2RxVWsUSeDb7mnrJF24Tz_nR-QPzwbuqV3rDcKFEz7BIV_EYKuJ4RZZk-k/s320/Backups.JPG" width="240"></a>
</p><p>
Archival data is often confused with backup data. Everyone should back up their data. After nearly two decades working in digital preservation, here is how I back up my four important systems:</p><ul>
  <li>I run my own mail and Web server. It is on my DMZ network, exposed to the Internet. It is backed up to a Raspberry Pi, also on the DMZ network but not directly accessible from the Internet. Once a week there is a full backup, and daily an incremental backup. Every week the full and incremental backups for the week are written to two DVD-Rs.</li>
  <li>My desktop PC creates a full backup on an external hard drive nightly. The drive is one of a cycle of three.</li>
  <li>I back up my iPhone to my Mac Air laptop every day.</li>
  <li>I create a Time Machine backup of my Mac Air laptop, which includes the most recent iPhone backup, every day on one of a cycle of <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/01/a-lesson-learned.html">three external SSDs</a>.</li>
</ul><p>
Each week the DVD-Rs, the current SSD and the current hard drive are moved off-site. Why am I doing all this? In case of disasters such as fire or ransomware I want to be able to recover to a state as close as possible to that before the disaster. In my case, the worst case is not more than one week.</p><p>

Note the implication that the useful life of backup data is only the time that elapses between the last backup before a disaster and the recovery. Media life span is irrelevant to backup data; that is why backups and archiving are <i>completely different problems</i>.</p><p>

The fact that the data encoded in magnetic grains on the platters of the three hard drives is <a href="https://www.abitare.org/papers/ISandT2008.pdf">good for a quarter-century</a> is interesting but irrelevant to the backup task.</p><div>

</div><p>
I have saved many hundreds of pairs of weekly DVD-Rs but the only ones that are ever accessed more than a few weeks after being written are the ones I use for my annual series of <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/08/2024-optical-media-durability-update.html"><i>Optical Media Durability Update</i></a> posts. It is interesting that:</p><blockquote>
  with no special storage precautions, generic low-cost media, and consumer drives, I'm getting good data from CD-Rs more than 20 years old, and from DVD-Rs nearly 18 years old.
</blockquote><p>
But the DVD-R media lifetime is not why I'm writing backups to them. The attribute I'm interested in is that DVD-Rs are <i>write-once</i>; the backup data could be destroyed but it can't be modified.</p><p>

Note that the good data from 18-year-old DVD-Rs means that consumers have an affordable, effective archival technology. But the market for optical media and drives is dying, killed off by streaming, which suggests that consumers don't really care about archiving their data. Cathy Marshall's 2008 talk <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/fast08/tech/marshall.pdf"><i>Its Like A Fire, You Just Have To Move On</i></a> vividly describes this attitude. Her subtitle is "Rethinking personal digital archiving".</p><h2>Archival Data</h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Over time, data falls down the storage hierarchy.</li>
<li>Data is archived when it can't earn its keep on near-line media.</li>
<li>Lower cost is purchased with longer access latency.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>
What is a useful definition of archival data? It is data that can no longer earn its keep on readily accessible storage. Thus the fundamental design goal for archival storage systems is to reduce costs by tolerating increased access latency. Data is archived, that is moved to an archival storage system, to save money. Archiving is an <i>economic</i> rather than a technical issue.</p><p>
How long should the archived data last? The <a href="https://longnow.org/">Long Now Foundation</a> is building the <a href="https://longnow.org/clock/">Clock of the Long Now</a>, intended to keep time for 10,000 years. They would like to accompany it with a 10,000-year archive. That is at least two orders of magnitude longer than I am talking about here. We are only just over 75 years from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Baby">first stored-program computer</a>, so designing a digital archive for a century is a very ambitious goal.</p><h2>Archival Media</h2>
<p>
The mainstream media occasionally comes out with an announcement like this from the <i>Daily Mail</i> in 2013. Note the extrapolation from "a 26 second excerpt" to "every film and TV program ever created in a teacup".</p><p>
Six years later, this is a picture of, as far as I know, the only write-to-read DNA storage drive ever demonstrated. It is from the Microsoft/University of Washington team that has done much of the research in DNA storage. They published it in 2019's <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41228-8"><i>Demonstration of End-to-End Automation of DNA Data Storage</i></a>. It cost about $10K and took 21 hours to write then read 5 bytes. </p><p>

 The technical press is equally guilty.  The canonical article about some development in the lab starts with the famous IDC graph projecting the amount of data that will be generated in the future. It goes on to describe the amazing density some research team achieved by writing say a gigabyte into their favorite medium in the lab, and how this density could store all the world's data in a teacup for ever. This conveys five false impressions.</p><h3>Market Size</h3><p>
First, that there is some possibility the researchers could scale their process up to a meaningful fraction of IDC's projected demand, or even to the microscopic fraction of the projected demand that makes sense to archive. There is no such possibility. Archival media is a much <i>smaller</i> market than regular media. In 2018's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/03/archival-media-not-good-business.html"><i>Archival Media: Not a Good Business</i></a> I wrote:</p><blockquote>

Archival-only media such as <a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/meetings/DSA2016/Day2/HUMMEL_G47-Bit_Plane_Image-Live_Fast_Pitch.pdf">steel tape</a>, <a href="https://www.storagenewsletter.com/2014/10/31/rd-hitachi-rw-of-digital-data-in-fused-silica-glass/">silica DVDs</a>, <a href="http://phys.org/news/2016-02-eternal-5d-storage-history-humankind.html">5D quartz DVDs</a>, and now <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/02/dnas-niche-in-storage-market.html">DNA</a> face some fundamental business model problems because they function only at the very bottom of the storage hierarchy. The usual diagram of the storage hierarchy, like this one from the Microsoft/UW team researching DNA storage, makes it look like the size of the market increases downwards. But that's very far from the case.<br>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://digitalpreservation.gov/meetings/DSA2024/loc_dsa2024_website_0104_Lauhoff_Libary_of_Congress_2024_IBM.pdf">IBM's Georg Lauhoff and Gary M Decad's slide</a> shows that the size of the market in dollar terms <i>decreases</i> downwards. LTO tape is less than 1% of the media market in dollar terms and less than 5% in capacity terms. Archival media are a very small part of the storage market. It is noteworthy that in 2023 Optical Archival (OD-3), the most recent archive-only medium, was canceled for lack of a large enough market. It was a 1TB optical disk, an upgrade from Blu-Ray.</p><h3>Timescales</h3><p>
Second, that the researcher's favorite medium could make it into the market in the timescale of IDC's projections. Because the reliability and performance requirements of storage media are so challenging, time scales in the storage market are much longer than the industry's marketeers like to suggest.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMEtHjIgtxAHlXzy_DQUhs8BB0KgahIURfneVHh3b49Byhf-rd_j7Qf9_7aSbFmWjIArop5kBHWS95UuOMYFrA9hbiNoEyDGnJNb7MOjLGtqRGFHfe9jb7HfpcbAsMVNGyh_-meN9PY7LEz1C4vIzDQDynC6EhUX3PV8K0wJ55NZwt2Hmk187QRdN5_pyr/s730/DaveAnderson.png"><img data-original-height="497" data-original-width="730" height="218" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMEtHjIgtxAHlXzy_DQUhs8BB0KgahIURfneVHh3b49Byhf-rd_j7Qf9_7aSbFmWjIArop5kBHWS95UuOMYFrA9hbiNoEyDGnJNb7MOjLGtqRGFHfe9jb7HfpcbAsMVNGyh_-meN9PY7LEz1C4vIzDQDynC6EhUX3PV8K0wJ55NZwt2Hmk187QRdN5_pyr/s320/DaveAnderson.png" width="320"></a>
</p><p>
Take, for example, Seagate's development of the next generation of hard disk technology, HAMR, where research started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190813175046/https://www.seagate.com/news/news-archive/seagate-swings-increase-disc-drive-densities-master-pr/">twenty-six years ago</a>. Nine years later in 2008 they published this graph, showing HAMR entering the market in 2009. Seventeen years later it is only now starting to be shipped to the hyper-scalers. Research on data in silica started <a href="https://www.storagenewsletter.com/2014/10/31/rd-hitachi-rw-of-digital-data-in-fused-silica-glass/">fifteen years ago</a>. Research on the DNA medium started <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/777811">thirty-six years ago</a>. Neither is within five years of market entry.</p><h3>Customers</h3><p>
Third, that even if the researcher's favorite medium did make it into the market it would be a product that consumers could use. As <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Kestutis Patiejunas figured out</a> at Facebook more than a decade ago, because the systems that surround archival media rather than the media themselves are the major cost, the only way to make the economics of archival storage work is to do it at data-center scale but in warehouse space and harvest the synergies that come from not needing data-center power, cooling, staffing, etc.</p><p>
Storage has an analog of Moore's Law called <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kryders-law/">Kryder's Law</a>, which states that over time the density of bits on a storage medium increases exponentially. Given the need to reduce costs at data-center scale, Kryder's Law limits the service life of even quasi-immortal media. As we see with tape robots, where data is routinely migrated to newer, denser media long before its theoretical lifespan, what matters is the economic, not the technical lifespan of a medium.</p><p>

Hard disks are replaced every five years although the magnetically encoded data on the platters is <a href="https://www.abitare.org/papers/ISandT2008.pdf">good for a quarter-century</a>. They are engineered to have a five-year life because Kryder's Law implies that they will be replaced after five years even though they still work perfectly. Seagate actually built drives with 25-year life but found that no-one would pay the extra for the longer life.</p><h3>The Cloud</h3>
<p>
Fourth, that anyone either cares or even knows what medium their archived data lives on. Only the hyper-scalers do. Consumers believe their data is safe in the cloud. Why bother backing it up, let alone archiving it, if it is safe anyway? If anyone really cares about archiving they use a service such as Glacier, when they definitely have no idea what medium is being used.</p><h3>Threats</h3>
<p>
Fifth, that bit rot is the only threat that matters; the idea that with quasi-immortal media you don't need Lots Of Copies to Keep Stuff Safe.</p><p>

No medium is perfect. They all have a specified Unrecoverable Bit Error Rate (UBER) rate. For example, typical <a href="https://www.seagate.com/content/dam/seagate/en/content-fragments/products/datasheets/exos-x24/exos-x24-DS2080-2307US-en_US.pdf">disk UBERs are 10<sup>-15</sup></a>. A petabyte is 8*10<sup>15</sup> bits, so if the drive is within its specified performance you can expect up to 8 errors when reading a petabyte. The specified UBER is an upper limit, you will normally see <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2005/12/tr-2005-166.pdf">far fewer</a>. The <a href="https://cdn.allbound.com/iq-ab/2022/12/LTO-9-TB00068A.pdf">UBER for LT09 tape is 10<sup>-20</sup></a>, so unrecoverable errors on a new tape are very unlikely. But not impossible, and the rate goes up steeply with tape wear.</p><p>

The property that classifies a medium as quasi-immortal is not that its reliability is greater than regular media to start with, although as with tape it may be. It is rather that its reliability decays more slowly than that of regular media. Thus archival systems need to use erasure coding to mitigate both UBER data loss and media failures such as disk crashes and tape wear-out.</p><p>

Another reason for needing erasure codes is that media errors are not the only ones needing mitigation. What matters is the reliability the system delivers to the end user.  Research has shown that the <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2008/03/more-bad-news-on-storage-reliability.html">majority of end user errors</a> come from layers of the system above the actual media.</p><p>

The archive may contain personally identifiable or other sensitive data. If so, the data on the medium must be encrypted. This is a double-edged sword, because the encryption key becomes a single point of failure; its loss or corruption renders the entire archive inaccessible. So you need Lots Of Copies to keep the key safe. But the more copies the greater the risk of key compromise.</p><p>

Media such as silica, DNA, quartz DVDs, steel tape and so on address bit rot, which is only one of the threats to which long-lived data is subject.  Clearly a single copy on such media, even if erasure coded, is still subject to threats including fire, flood, earthquake, ransomware, and insider attacks.  Thus even an archive needs to maintain multiple copies. This greatly increases the cost, bringing us back to the economic threat.</p><h2>Archival Storage Systems</h2><p>
At Facebook Patiejunas built rack-scale systems, each holding 10,000 100GB optical disks for a Petabyte per rack. Writable Blu-Ray disks are about 80 cents each, so the media to fill the rack would cost about $8K. This is clearly much less than the cost of the robotics and the drives.</p><p>
Let's drive this point home with another example. An <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ts4300">IBM TS4300</a> LTO tape robot <a href="https://www.ibm.com/flashsystem/pricing/us-en/family/TP9JK5">starts at $20K</a>. Two 20-pack tape cartridges to fill it cost about $4K, so the media is about 16% of the total system capex. The opex for the robot includes power, cooling, space, staff and an IBM maintenance contract. The opex for the tapes is essentially zero.</p><p>

The media is an insignificant part of the total lifecycle cost of storing archival data on tape. What matters for the economic viability of an archival storage system is minimizing the total system cost, not the cost of the media. No-one is going to spend $24K on a rack-mount tape system from IBM to store 720TB for their home or small business. The economics only work at data-center scale.</p><p>

The reason why this focus on media is a distraction is that the fundamental problem of digital preservation is economic, not technical.  No-one wants to pay for preserving data that isn't earning its keep, pretty much the definition of archived data.  The cost per terabyte of the <i>medium</i> is irrelevant, what drives the economic threat is the capital and operational cost of the <i>system</i>. Take tape for example. The media capital cost is low, but the much higher system capital cost includes the drives and the robotics. Then there are the operational costs of the data center space, power, cooling and staff. It is only by operating at data-center scale and thus amortizing the capital and operational costs over very large amounts of data that the system costs per terabyte can be made competitive.</p><p>

Operating at data center scale, as <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Patiejunas discovered</a> and <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/01/storage-roundup.html">Microsoft understands</a>, means that one of the parameters that determines the system cost is <i>write bandwidth</i>. Each of Facebook's racks wrote 12 optical disks in parallel almost continuously. It would take over 800 times the time to write an entire disk to fill the rack.  At the 8x write speed it takes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray#Drive_speeds">22.5 minutes</a> to fill a disk, so it would take around 18,750 minutes to fill the rack, or about two weeks. It isn't clear how many racks Facebook needed simultaneously doing this to keep up with the flow of user-generated content, but it was likely enough to fill a reasonable-size warehouse. Similarly, it would take about 8.5 days to fill the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/dtl?topic=performance-lto-specifications">base model TS4300</a>.</p><h3>Project Silica</h3><p>
I wrote about <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">Microsoft's Project Silica</a> a year ago, in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/03/microsofts-archival-storage-research.html"><i>Microsoft's Archival Storage Research</i></a>. It uses femtosecond lasers to write data into platters of silica.
Like Facebook's, the prototype Silica systems are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">data-center size</a>:</p><div>
<blockquote>
A <i>Silica library</i> is a sequence of contiguous write, read, and storage racks interconnected by a platter delivery system.  Along all racks there are parallel horizontal rails that span the entire library. We refer to a side of the library (spanning all racks) as a <i>panel</i>. A set of <i>free roaming</i> robots called <i>shuttles</i> are used to move platters between locations.<br>
...<br>
A read rack contains multiple read drives. Each read drive is independent and has slots into which platters are inserted and removed. The number of shuttles active on a panel is limited to twice the number of read drives in the panel. The write drive is full-rack-sized and writes multiple platters concurrently.
</blockquote>
</div><p>
Their performance evaluation focuses on the ability to respond to read requests within 15 hours. Their cost evaluation, like Facebook's, focuses on the savings from using warehouse-type space to house the equipment, although is isn't clear that they have actually done so. The rest of their cost evaluation is somewhat hand-wavy, as is natural for a system that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">isn't yet in production</a>:</p><div>
<blockquote>
The Silica read drives use polarization microscopy, which is a commoditized technique widely used in many applications and is low-cost. Currently, system cost in Silica is dominated by the write drives, as they use femtosecond lasers which are currently expensive and used in niche applications.  ...  As the Silica technology proliferates, it will drive up the demand for femtosecond lasers, commoditizing the technology.
</blockquote>
</div><p>
I'm skeptical of "commoditizing the technology". Archival systems are a niche in the IT market, and one on which companies are loath to spend money. Realistically, there aren't going to be a vast number of Silica write heads. The only customers for systems like Silica are the large cloud providers, who will be reluctant to commit their archives to technology owned by a competitor. Unless a mass-market application for femtosecond lasers emerges, the scope for cost reduction is limited.</p><p>

But the more I think about this technology, which is still in the lab, the more I think it probably has the best chance of impacting the market among all the rival archival storage technologies. Not great, but better than its competitors:</p><ul>
<li>The media is very cheap and very dense, so the effect of Kryder's Law economics driving media replacement and thus its economic rather than technical lifetime is minimal.</li>
<li>The media is quasi-immortal and survives benign neglect, so opex once written is minimal.</li>
<li>The media is write-once, and the write and read heads are physically separate, so the data cannot be encrypted or erased by malware. The long read latency makes exfiltrating large amounts of data hard.</li>
<li>The robotics are simple and highly redundant. Any of the shuttles can reach any of the platters. They should be much less troublesome than tape library robotics because, unlike tape, a robot failure only renders a small fraction of the library inaccessible and is easily repaired.</li>
<li>All the technologies needed are in the market now, the only breakthroughs needed are economic, not technological.</li>
<li>The team has worked on improving the  write bandwidth which is a critical issue for archival storage at scale. They can currently write hundreds of megabytes a second.</li>
<li>Like <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Facebook's archival storage technologies</a>, Project Silica enjoys the synergies of data center scale without needing full data center environmental and power resources.</li>
<li>Like Facebook's technologies, Project Silica has an in-house customer, Azure's archival storage, with a need for a product like this.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The expensive part of the system is the write head. It is an entire rack using femtosecond lasers, which start at around $50K. The eventual system's economics will depend upon the progress made in cost-reducing the lasers.</p><h2>Retrieval</h2>
<p>
The Svalbard archipelago is where I spent the summer of 1969 doing a geological survey.</p><p>

The most important part of an archiving strategy is knowing how you will get stuff out of the archive. Putting stuff in and keeping it safe are important and relatively easy, but if you can't get stuff out when you need it what's the point?</p><p>

In some cases access is only needed to a small proportion of the archive. At Facebook, Patiejunas expected that the major reason for access would be to respond to a subpoena. In other cases, such as migrating to a new archival system, bulk data retrieval is required.</p><p>

But if the reason for needing access is disaster recovery it is important to have a vision of what resources are likley to be available after the disaster. Microsoft gained a lot of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-11-13/microsoft-apocalypse-proofs-open-source-code-in-an-arctic-cave">valuable PR</a> by encoding much of the world's open source software in QR codes on film and storing the cans of film in an abandoned coal mine in Svalbard so it would "survive the apocalypse". In <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2019/11/seeds-or-code.html"><i>Seeds Or Code?</i></a> I had a lot of fun imagining how the survivors of the apocalypse would be able to access the archive.</p><div>

</div><p>
To make a long story short, after even a mild apocalypse, they wouldn't be able to. Let's just point out that the first steps after the apocalypse are getting to Svalbard. They won't be able to fly to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard_Airport">LYR</a>. As the crow flies, the voyage from Tromsø is 591 miles across very stormy seas. It takes several days, and getting to Tromsø won't be easy either.</p><h2>Archival Storage Services</h2><p>
Because technologies have very strong economies of scale, the economics of most forms of IT work in favor of the hyper-scalers. These forces are especially strong for archival data, both because it is almost pure cost with no income, and because as I discussed earlier the economics of archival storage only work at data-center scale. It will be the rare institution that can avoid using cloud archival storage. I analyzed the way these economic forces operate in 2019's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2019/02/cloud-for-preservation.html"><i>Cloud For Preservation</i></a>:</p><div>
<blockquote>
Much of the attraction of cloud technology for organizations, especially public institutions funded through a government's annual budget process, is that they transfer costs from capital to operational expenditure. It is easy to believe that this increases financial flexibility. As regards ingest and dissemination, this may be true. Ingesting some items can be delayed to the next budget cycle, or the access rate limit lowered temporarily. But as regards preservation, it isn't true. It is unlikely that parts of the institution's collection can be de-accessioned in a budget crunch, only to be re-accessioned later when funds are adequate. Even were the content still available to be re-ingested, the cost of ingest is a significant fraction of the total life-cycle cost of preserving digital content.
</blockquote>
</div><p>
Cloud services typically charge differently for ingest, storage and retrieval. The service's goal in designing their pricing structure is to create lock-in, by analogy with the drug-dealer's algorithm "the first one's free".
In 2019 I used the published rates to compute the cost of ingesting in a month, storing for a year, and retrieving in a month a petabyte using the archive services of the three main cloud providers. Here is that table, with the costs adjusted for inflation to 2024 using the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics' calculator</a>:</p><div>
<table cols="6"><tbody>
<tr>
    <th colspan="6">Archival Services</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Service</th>
    <th>In</th>
    <th>Store</th>
    <th>Out</th>
    <th>Total</th>
    <th>Lock-in</th>
  </tr>
<tr> <td><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/pricing/">AMZN Glacier</a></td> <td>$2,821</td> <td>$60,182</td> <td>$69,260</td> <td>$132,263</td> <td>13.8</td></tr>
<tr> <td><a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing">GOOG Coldline</a></td> <td>$4,514</td> <td>$105,319</td> <td>$105,144</td> <td>$214,977</td> <td>12.0</td></tr>
<tr> <td><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/blobs/">MSFT Archive</a></td> <td>$7,962</td> <td>$30,091</td> <td>$20,387</td> <td>$58,440</td> <td>8.1</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div><p>
The "Lock-in" column is the approximate number of months of storage cost that getting the Petabyte out in a month represents. Note that:</p><ul>
<li>In all cases getting data out is much more expensive than putting it in.</li>
<li>The lower cost of archival storage compared to the same service's near-line storage is purchased at the expense of a much stronger lock-in.</li>
<li>Since the whole point of archival storage is keeping data for the long term, the service will earn much more in storage charges over the longer life of archival data than the shorter life of near-line data.</li>
</ul><p>
There may well be reasons why retrieving data from archival storage is expensive. Most storage technologies have unified read/write heads, so retrieval competes with ingest which, as Patiejunas figured out, is the critical performance parameter for archival storage. This is because, to minimize cost, archival systems are designed assuming bulk retrieval is rare. When it happens, whether from a user request or to migrate data to new media, it is disruptive. For example, emptying a base model TS4300 occupies it for more than a week.</p><p>

Six years later, things have changed significantly. Here is the current version of the archival services table:</p><p>
Points to note:</p><ul>
<li>Glacier is the only one of the three that is significantly cheaper in real terms than it was 6 years ago.</li>
<li>Glacier can do this because Kryder's Law has made their storage about a factor of about 6 cheaper in real terms in six years, or about a 35% Kryder rate. This is somewhat faster than the rate of areal density increase of tape, and much faster than that of disk. The guess is that Glacier Deep Archive is on tape.</li>
<li>Google's pricing indicates they aren't serious about the archival market.</li>
<li>Archive services now have differentiated tiers of service. This table uses S3 Deep Archive, Google Archive and Microsoft Archive.</li>
<li>Lock-in has increased from 13.8/12.0/8.1 to 50/175/20. It is also increased by additional charges for data lifetimes less than a threshold, 180/365/180 days. So my cost estimate for Google is too low, because the data would suffer these charges. But accounting for this would skew the comparison.</li>
<li>Bandwidth charges are a big factor in lock-in. For Amazon they are 77%, for Google they are 38%, for Microsoft they are 32%.  Amazon's marketing is smart, hoping you won't notice the outbound bandwidth charges.</li>
</ul><p>
Looking at these numbers it is hard to see how anyone can justify any archive storage other than S3 Deep Archive. It is the only one delivering Kryder's Law to the customer, and as my <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2017/08/economic-model-of-long-term-storage.html">economic model</a> shows, delivering Kryder's Law is essential to affordable long-term storage. A petabyte for a decade costs under $120K before taking Kryder's Law into account and you can get it all out for under $50K.</p><h2>LOCKSS</h2>

</div><p>
The fundamental idea behind LOCKSS was that, given a limited budget and a realistic range of threats, data would survive better in many cheap, unreliable, loosely-coupled replicas than in a single expensive, durable one.</p><div>
<blockquote>
Replacing one drive takes about 15 minutes of work. If we have 30,000 drives and 2 percent fail, it takes 150 hours to replace those.  In other words, one employee for one month of 8 hour days. Getting the failure rate down to 1 percent means you save 2 weeks of employee salary - maybe $5,000 total? The 30,000 drives costs you $4m.<p>

The $5k/$4m means the Hitachis are worth 1/10th of 1 per cent higher cost to us. ACTUALLY we pay even more than that for them, but not more than a few dollars per drive (maybe 2 or 3 percent more).</p><p>

Moral of the story: design for failure and buy the cheapest components you can. :-)
</p></blockquote>
</div><p>
Brian Wilson, CTO of BackBlaze <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/04/evercloud-workshop.html">pointed out</a> eleven years ago that in their long-term storage environment <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/17/backblaze_how_not_to_evaluate_disk_reliability/">"Double the reliability is only worth 1/10th of 1 percent cost increase"</a>.

<p><span>One week after</span> Hamas’s October 7 attack, thousands rallied outside the Israeli Consulate in Los Angeles to protest the country’s retaliatory assault on Gaza. The protestors were peaceful, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-10-14/thousands-of-pro-palestinian-groups-gather-in-front-of-federal-building-in-westwood">according to local media</a>, “carrying signs that said ‘Free Palestine’ and ‘End the Occupation,’” and watched over by a “sizable police presence in the area.” The LAPD knew the protests were coming: Two days earlier, the department received advanced warning on Dataminr, a social media surveillance firm and “<a href="https://partners.x.com/en/partners/dataminr">official partner</a>” of X.</p>



<p>Internal Los Angeles Police Department emails obtained via public records request show city police used Dataminr to track Gaza-related demonstrations and other constitutionally protected speech. The department receives real-time alerts from Dataminr not only about protests in progress, but also warnings of upcoming demonstrations as well. Police were tipped off about protests in the Los Angeles area and across the country. On at least one occasion, the emails show a Dataminr employee contacted the LAPD directly to inform officers of a protest being planned that apparently hadn’t been picked up by the company’s automated scanning.</p>



<p>Based on the records obtained by The Intercept, which span October 2023 to April 2024, Dataminr alerted the LAPD of more than 50 different protests, including at least a dozen before they occurred.</p>



<p>It’s unclear whether the LAPD used any of these notifications to inform its response to the wave of pro-Palestine protests that spread across Southern California over the last two years, which have resulted in hundreds of arrests.</p>



<p>Neither the LAPD nor Dataminr responded to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Privacy and civil liberties experts argue that police surveillance of First Amendment activity from afar has chilling effect on political association, discourse and dissent.</p>



<div><p>“Police departments are surveilling protests which are First Amendment protected political activity about a matter of public importance,” Jennifer Granick, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, told The Intercept. “They are using taxpayer money to enlist companies to conduct this surveillance on social media. This is especially worrisome now that the Administration is targeting Gaza protesters for arrest and deportation based on protected activity.”</p><!-- BLOCK(promote-post)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22slug%22%3A%22israel-palestine%22%2C%22crop%22%3A%22promo%22%7D) -->  </div>

<p><span>The alerts began</span> pouring in on October 9, when Dataminr flagged a “Protest mentioning Israel” blocking traffic in Beverly Hills, citing a tweet. Over the course of the month, Dataminr tipped off the LAPD to six different protests against the war across Los Angeles. These alerts included information about protests already in progress and information about the time and place of at least one LA protest planned for a future date.</p>



<p>Emails produced by the LAPD in response to The Intercept’s records request show that along with its regular feed of information about constitutionally protected speech, it also provides the department with alerts curated through feeds with titles like “Domestic Demonstrations Awareness,” “LA demonstrations,” “LA unrest,” and “demonstrations,” indicating the department proactively monitors First Amendment gatherings using the platform.</p>



<p>The department also began receiving a regular flow of alerts about protests thousands of miles away, including a “protest mentioning Palestinian territories outside the Consulate General of Israel” in Chicago,” and tweets from journalist Talia Jane, who was providing real-time updates on an antiwar rally in New York City.</p>



<p>Jane told The Intercept that she objects to the monitoring of her reporting by police, and also said Dataminr’s summary of her posts were at times inaccurate. In one instance, she says, Dataminr attributed a Manhattan road closure to protesters, when it had in fact been closed by the NYPD. “It’s absurd any agency would spend money on a service that is apparently completely incapable of parsing information correctly,” she said, adding that “the surveillance of journalists’ social media to suppress First Amendment activity is exactly why members of the press have a responsibility to ensure their work is not used to harm people.”</p>



<p>On October 17, Dataminr sent an “urgent update” to the department warning of a “Demonstration mentioning Palestinian territories planned for today at 17:00 in Rittenhouse Square area of Philadelphia,” based on a tweet. Three days later, a similar update noted another “Demonstration mentioning Palestinian territories” planned for Boston’s Copley Square. Another warned of a “protest mentioning Palestinian territories” in the planning stages at the Oregon State Capitol. It’s unclear if the department intended to cast such a wide net, or if the out-of-state protest alerts were sent in error. Dataminr’s threat notifications are known to turn up false positives; multiple tweets by angry Taylor Swift fans aimed at Ticketmaster were forwarded to the LAPD as “L.A. Threats and Disruptions,” the records show.</p>



<p>Materials obtained by The Intercept also show that despite Dataminr’s marketing claims of being an “AI” intermediary between public data and customers, the firm has put its human fingers on the scales. On October 12, a Dataminr account manager emailed three LAPD officers, whose names are redacted, with the subject line “FYSA,” military shorthand meaning “for your situational awareness.” The email informed the officers of a “Protest planned for October 14 at 12:30 at Consulate General of Israel in Los Angeles,” with a link to a tweet by a Los Angeles university professor. It’s unclear if the LAPD has requested these manual tip-offs from Dataminr, or whether such personal service is routine; Dataminr did not respond when asked if it was a standard practice. But the hands-on approach undercuts Dataminr’s prior claims that it just passively provides alerts to customers about social media speech germane to their interests.</p>



<p>A company spokesperson previously told The Intercept that “Every First Alert user has access to the exact same alerts and can choose to receive the alerts most relevant to them.””</p>

<p><span>Dataminr pitches its</span> clients across the private and public sector a social media superpower: What if you had immediate access tweet relevant to your interests — without having to even conduct a search? The company, founded in 2016 and valued at over $4 billion, claims a wide variety of customers, from media newsrooms to government agencies, including lucrative federal contracts with the Department of Defense. It has also found an avid customer base in law enforcement. While its direct access to Twitter has been a primary selling point, Dataminr also scours apps like Snap and Telegram.</p>



<p>The company — which boasts both Twitter and the CIA as early investors — pitches its&nbsp;“First Alert” software platform as a public safety-oriented newsfeed of breaking events.</p>



<p>It has for years defended its police work as simply news reporting, arguing it can’t be considered a surveillance tool because the information relayed to police is public and differs in no way from what an ordinary user browsing social media could access.</p>



<p>Privacy advocates and civil libertarians have countered that the software provides the government with visibility that far surpasses what any individual user or even team of human officers could accomplish. Indeed, Dataminr’s own law enforcement marketing materials <a href="https://www.dataminr.com/resources/solution-sheet/use-public-data-to-make-decisions-faster/">claim</a> “30k people working 24/7 would only process 1% of all the data Dataminr ingests each day.”&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>The company has this power because of its long-standing “official partner” status with both Twitter and now X. Dataminr purchases access to the platform’s data “firehose,” allowing it to query every single post and scan them on behalf of clients in real-time.</p>



<p>Previous reporting by The Intercept has shown Dataminr has used this privileged access to surveil <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/05/15/abortion-surveillance-dataminr/">abortion rights rallies</a>, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/07/09/twitter-dataminr-police-spy-surveillance-black-lives-matter-protests/">Black Lives Matter protests</a>, and other constitutionally protected speech on behalf of both local and federal police. Dataminr <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/10/21/dataminr-twitter-surveillance-racial-profiling/">sources told The Intercept in 2020</a> how the company’s human analysts, helping tailor the service to its various police and military customers, at time demonstrated implicit biases in their work — an allegation the company denied.</p>

<p>In its previous incarnation as Twitter before its purchase by Elon Musk, and today as X, the social media platform for years <a href="https://developer.x.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy">expressly prohibited</a> third parties from using its user data for “monitoring sensitive events (including but not limited to protests, rallies, or community organizing meetings),” per its terms of service. Both companies have previously claimed that Dataminr’s service by definition cannot be considered surveillance because it is applied against public discourse; critics have often pointed out that while posts are technically public, only a company with data access as powerful as Dataminr’s would ever be able to find and flag all of these specific posts amid hundreds of millions of others. Neither company has directly addressed how Dataminr’s monitoring of protests is compatible with Twitter and X’s explicit prohibition against monitoring protests.</p>



<p>Neither X nor Dataminr responded when asked about this contradiction.</p>



  



<p>While Dataminr’s monitoring of campus protests began before the second Trump administration, it has taken on greater significance now given the White House’s <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/03/13/briefing-podcast-mahmoud-khalil-free-speech/">overt attempts to criminalize speech</a> critical of Israel and the war in Gaza. Earlier this month, former Columbia graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, who helped organize Columbia University’s student protests against the war, was abruptly arrested and jailed by plainclothes Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. The State Department and White House quickly confirmed the arrest was a function of Khalil’s antiwar protest efforts, which the administration has described without evidence or explanation as “aligned to Hamas.” The White House has<a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/03/11/mahmoud-khalil-columbia-ice-louisiana/"> pledged to arrest and deport</a> more individuals who have taken part in similar campus protests against the war.</p>



<p>Civil libertarians have long objected to dragnet monitoring of political speech on the grounds that it will have a chilling effect on speech guaranteed by the First Amendment. While fires, shootings, and natural disasters are of obvious interest to police, these critics frequently argue that if people know their tweets are subject to police scrutiny without any evidence of wrongdoing, they may tend to self-censor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Political action supporting any kind of government-disfavored viewpoint could be subject to the same over-policing: gun rights, animal rights, climate change are just a few examples,” the ACLU’s Granick added. “Law enforcement should leave online organizing alone.”</p>

<p>Taara is spinning out of X to become an independent company with a mission to bring high-speed, affordable and abundant connectivity to people everywhere using beams of light.</p>
<p><span>Mahesh Krishnaswamy, CEO of Taara</span><span>/</span><span>March 17, 2025</span></p>

</div>
</section>
<div>
<p>Today, we’re announcing that the Taara team is graduating from The Moonshot Factory to become an independent company. We’ve raised a round of funding led by <a href="https://seriesx.capital/">Series X Capital</a> to deploy and scale Taara’s groundbreaking new approach to wireless optical communications, which uses light to deliver high-speed, high-capacity connectivity over long distances.</p>
<p>As I shared in today’s episode of <a href="https://x.company/moonshotpodcast/">The Moonshot Podcast</a>, the journey to becoming a company has been a series of adventures. Inspired by <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/02/google-shot-laser-60-miles-just-send-copy-real-genius/">Loon’s breakthrough work</a> establishing connectivity between two stratospheric balloons, our philosophy building Taara has always been to take technology out of the lab and test it with partners to learn as quickly as possible.&nbsp;From beaming connectivity over the world's <a href="https://x.company/blog/posts/taara-beaming-broadband-across-congo/">deepest river</a>, to deploying in densely populated <a href="https://x.company/case-study/taara-in-africa/">neighborhoods</a>, every pilot project and every partnership has helped bring us closer to overcoming the stubborn connectivity gaps that prevent nearly <a href="https://www.itu.int/itu-d/reports/statistics/2022/11/24/ff22-internet-use/">3 billion people</a> from accessing the internet.</p>

<p>Episode 2 of <a href="https://x.company/moonshotpodcast/">The Moonshot Podcast</a>, "Essential Connections" looks at X’s mission to find radical new ways to connect the unconnected—starting with Loon balloons and evolving into Taara’s light-beamed internet.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>My passion for connectivity was sparked while I was applying for universities in the U.S. from an internet cafe in Chennai.&nbsp;Listening to the beeps and chirps of the dial up modem. I became obsessed with connectivity, and I wanted to bring its economic, educational, and social benefits to more people. Our entire Taara team shares this passion—a diverse group of manufacturing experts, telco industry veterans, optical and photonics engineers and more.</p>
<h2>Moving to the Light Generation</h2>
<p>The connectivity challenge is only becoming more urgent as the world’s demand for data increases. Fiber is the gold standard for high-speed connectivity, but it's often difficult to lay because it's costly, impractical or geographically impossible. Where fiber fails to reach, operators and service providers often turn to radio frequency to fill the gap. However, traditional radio frequency bands are congested and running out of available bandwidth, making it harder to support 5G expansion and keep up the growing <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/05/data-growth-drives-ict-energy-innovation/">global demand</a> for fast, reliable connectivity.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.company/projects/taara/">Taara Lightbridge</a> brings fast, fiber-like internet access to areas where it’s too difficult or expensive to install traditional fiber, like in dense city neighborhoods, over rivers and seas, or across rugged terrains and national parks. In the same way fiber optic cables in the ground use light to carry data, Taara uses narrow, invisible light beams to transmit information through the air, at speeds as high as 20 gigabits per second and across distances up to 20 kilometers. Taara’s Lightbridge units deliver high speed, high quality internet and require only a few hours to set up, without the time and cost associated with digging trenches or stringing cables.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Deep neural networks are often seen as different from other model classes by defying conventional notions of generalization. Popular examples of anomalous generalization behaviour include benign overfitting, double descent, and the success of overparametrization. We argue that these phenomena are not distinct to neural networks, or particularly mysterious. Moreover, this generalization behaviour can be intuitively understood, and rigorously characterized using long-standing generalization frameworks such as PAC-Bayes and countable hypothesis bounds. We present soft inductive biases as a key unifying principle in explaining these phenomena: rather than restricting the hypothesis space to avoid overfitting, embrace a flexible hypothesis space, with a soft preference for simpler solutions that are consistent with the data. This principle can be encoded in many model classes, and thus deep learning is not as mysterious or different from other model classes as it might seem. However, we also highlight how deep learning is relatively distinct in other ways, such as its ability for representation learning, phenomena such as mode connectivity, and its relative universality.

Portuguese sea exploration was driven by navigation schools and historic voyages <i>“through seas never sailed before”</i> (<i>“Por mares nunca dantes navegados” </i>in Portuguese), as described by Portugal’s famous poet, Luís Vaz de Camões, born 500 years ago (1524).</p><p>Anyone familiar with Portugal knows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Portugal#Naval_exploration_and_Portuguese_Empire_(15th%E2%80%9316th_centuries)"><u>sea is central</u></a> to its identity.

          </p>
        <p>As Cloudflare’s CEO, Matthew Prince, <a href="https://x.com/eastdakota/status/1899226252956827846"><u>said</u></a> recently, this new wall of entropy began with an idea back in 2023: “What could we use for randomness that was like our lava lamp wall in San Francisco but represented our team in Portugal?”</p><p>The original inspiration came from wave motion machine desk toys, which were popular among some of our team members. Waves and the ocean not only provide a source of movement and randomness, but also align with Portugal’s maritime history and the office’s scenic view.</p><p>However, this was easier said than done. It turns out that making a wave machine wall is a real challenge, given that these toys are not as popular as they were in the past,&nbsp; and aren’t being manufactured in the size we needed any more. We scoured eBay and other sources but couldn't find enough, consistent in style and in working order wave machines. We also discovered that off-the-shelf models weren’t designed to run 24/7, which was a critical requirement for our use.</p><h4>Artistry to create wave machines</h4><p>Undaunted, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-top-100-most-loved-workplaces-in-2022"><u>Cloudflare’s Places team</u></a>, which ensures our offices reflect our values and culture, found a <a href="https://wavemotionmachines.com/"><u>U.S.-based artisan</u></a> that specializes in ocean wave displays to create the wave machines for us. Since 2009, his one-person business, <a href="https://wavemotionmachines.com/"><u>Hughes Wave Motion Machines</u></a>, has blended artistry, engineering, and research, following his transition from Lockheed Martin Space Systems, where he designed military and commercial satellites.</p>
<p><sup><i>Timelapse of the mesmerizing office waves, set to the tune of an AI-generated song.</i></sup></p><p>Collaborating closely, we developed a custom rectangular wave machine (18 inches/45 cm long) that runs nonstop — not an easy task — which required hundreds of hours of testing and many iterations. Featuring rotating wheels, continuous motors, and a unique fluid formula, these machines create realistic ocean-like waves in green, blue, and Cloudflare’s signature orange.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a quote from the artist himself about these wave machines:</p><blockquote><p><i>“The machine’s design is a balancing act of matching components and their placement to how the fluid responds in a given configuration. There is a complex yet delicate relationship between viscosity, specific gravity, the size and design of the vessel, and the placement of each mechanical interface. Everything must be precisely aligned, centered around the fluid like a mathematical function. I like to say it’s akin to ’balancing a checkerboard on a beach ball in the wind.’”</i></p></blockquote>

          </p>
        <p>Cloudflare’s servers handle 71 million HTTP requests per second on average, with 100 million HTTP requests per second at peak. <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#http-vs-https"><u>Most of these requests are secured via TLS</u></a>, which relies on secure randomness for cryptographic integrity. A Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator (<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/lava-lamp-encryption/"><u>CSPRNG</u></a>) ensures unpredictability, but only when seeded with high-quality entropy. Since chaotic movement in the real world is truly random, Cloudflare designed a system to harness it. Our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/harnessing-office-chaos/"><u>2024 blog post</u></a> expands on this topic in a more technical way, but here’s a quick summary.</p><p>In <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/randomness-101-lavarand-in-production/"><u>2017</u></a>, Cloudflare launched LavaRand, inspired by <a href="https://www.wired.com/1997/03/lava-lites-easy-to-break-hard-to-crack/"><u>Silicon Graphics’ 1997 concept</u></a> However, the need for randomness in security was already a hot topic on our blog before that, such as in our discussions of <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-randomness-matters/"><u>securing systems</u></a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/"><u>cryptography</u></a>. Originally, LavaRand collected entropy from a wall of lava lamps in our San Francisco office, feeding an internal API that servers periodically query to include in their entropy pools. Over time, we expanded LavaRand beyond lava lamps, incorporating <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/harnessing-office-chaos/#londons-unpredictable-pendulums"><u>new sources of office chaos</u></a> while maintaining the same core method.</p>

          </figure><p>A camera captures images of dynamic, unpredictable randomness displays. Shadows, lighting changes, and even sensor noise contribute entropy. Each image is then processed into a compact hash, converting it into a sequence of random bytes. These, combined with the previous seed and local system entropy, serve as input for a Key Derivation Function (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function"><u>KDF</u></a>), which generates a new seed for a CSPRNG — capable of producing virtually unlimited random bytes upon request. The waves in our Lisbon office are now contributing to this pool of randomness.</p>

          </figure><p>Cloudflare’s LavaRand API makes this randomness accessible internally, strengthening cryptographic security across our global infrastructure. For example, when you use <i>Math.random()</i> in <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/"><u>Cloudflare Workers</u></a>, part of that randomness comes from LavaRand. Similarly, querying our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/harnessing-office-chaos/#drand-distributed-and-verifiable-public-randomness"><u>drand API</u></a> taps into LavaRand as well. Cloudflare offers this API to enable anyone to generate random numbers and even seed their own systems.</p>

The visual elements create a cohesive experience, reinforcing a sense of motion. Each meeting room embraces this maritime theme, named after famous Portuguese beaches — including, naturally, Nazaré.</p><p>We partnered with an incredible group of local Portuguese vendors for this construction project, where all the leads were women — something incredibly rare for the industry. The local teams worked with passion, proudly wore Cloudflare t-shirts, and fostered a warm, family-like atmosphere. They openly expressed pride in the project, sharing how it stood out from anything they had worked on before.</p>

At the time, Krapivin didn’t give it much thought. But two years later, when he finally set aside time to go through the paper (“just for fun,” as he put it), his efforts would lead to a rethinking of a widely used tool in computer science.</p><p>The paper’s title, “<a data-offer-url="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12800" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12800&quot;}" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12800" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tiny Pointers</a>,” referred to arrowlike entities that can direct you to a piece of information, or element, in a computer’s memory. Krapivin soon came up with a potential way to further miniaturize the pointers so they consumed less memory. However, to achieve that, he needed a better way of organizing the data that the pointers would point to.</p><p>He turned to a common approach for storing data known as a hash table. But in the midst of his tinkering, Krapivin realized that he had invented a new kind of hash table, one that worked faster than expected—taking less time and fewer steps to find specific elements.</p><p><a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/martin-farach-colton" target="_blank">Martín Farach-Colton</a>, a coauthor of the “Tiny Pointers” paper and Krapivin’s former professor at Rutgers, was initially skeptical of Krapivin’s new design. Hash tables are among the most thoroughly studied data structures in all of computer science; the advance sounded too good to be true. But just to be sure, he asked a frequent collaborator (and a “Tiny Pointers” coauthor), <a data-offer-url="https://csd.cmu.edu/people/faculty/william-kuszmaul" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://csd.cmu.edu/people/faculty/william-kuszmaul&quot;}" href="https://csd.cmu.edu/people/faculty/william-kuszmaul" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">William Kuszmaul</a> of Carnegie Mellon University, to check out his student’s invention. Kuszmaul had a different reaction. “You didn’t just come up with a cool hash table,” he remembers telling Krapivin. “You’ve actually completely wiped out a 40-year-old conjecture!”</p><figure><p><span><p>Without setting out to do so, Andrew Krapivin upended the common thinking around hash tables—one of the best-studied tools in computer science.</p>
</span><span>Photograph: Phillip Ammon for Quanta Magazine</span></p></figure><p>Together, Krapivin (now a graduate student at the University of Cambridge), Farach-Colton (now at New York University), and Kuszmaul demonstrated in a <a data-offer-url="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02305" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02305&quot;}" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02305" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">January 2025 paper</a> that this new hash table can indeed find elements faster than was considered possible. ln so doing, they had disproved a conjecture long held to be true.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“It’s an important paper,” said <a data-offer-url="https://ajhconway.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://ajhconway.com/&quot;}" href="https://ajhconway.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Alex Conway</a> of Cornell Tech in New York City. “Hash tables are among the oldest data structures we have. And they’re still one of the most efficient ways to store data.” Yet open questions remain about how they work, he said. “This paper answers a couple of them in surprising ways.”</p><p>Hash tables have become ubiquitous in computing, partly because of their simplicity and ease of use. They’re designed to allow users to do exactly three things: “query” (search for) an element, delete an element, or insert one into an empty slot. The first hash tables date back to the early 1950s, and computer scientists have studied and used them ever since. Among other things, researchers wanted to figure out the speed limits for some of these operations. How fast, for example, could a new search or insertion possibly be?</p><figure><p><span><p>Martín Farach-Colton helped Krapivin prove that his new hash table contradicted a long-standing conjecture.</p>
</span><span>Photograph: Andrew Farach-Colton</span></p></figure><p>The answer generally depends on the amount of time it takes to find an empty spot in a hash table. This, in turn, typically depends on how full the hash table is. Fullness can be described in terms of an overall percentage—this table is 50 percent full, that one’s 90 percent—but researchers often deal with much fuller tables. So instead, they may use a whole number, denoted by <em>x</em>, to specify how close the hash table is to 100 percent full. If <em>x</em> is 100, then the table is 99 percent full. If <em>x</em> is 1,000, the table is 99.9 percent full. This measure of fullness offers a convenient way to evaluate how long it should take to perform actions like queries or insertions.</p><p>Researchers have long known that for certain common hash tables, the expected time required to make the worst possible insertion—putting an item into, say, the last remaining open spot—is proportional to <em>x</em>. “If your hash table is 99 percent full,” Kuszmaul said, “it makes sense that you would have to look at around 100 different positions to find a free slot.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In a <a data-offer-url="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3828.3836" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3828.3836&quot;}" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3828.3836" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">1985 paper</a>, the computer scientist <a data-offer-url="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/yao_1611524.cfm" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/yao_1611524.cfm&quot;}" href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/yao_1611524.cfm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Andrew Yao</a>, who would go on to win the A.M. Turing Award, asserted that among hash tables with a specific set of properties, the best way to find an individual element or an empty spot is to just go through potential spots randomly—an approach known as uniform probing. He also stated that, in the worst-case scenario, where you’re searching for the last remaining open spot, you can never do better than <em>x</em>. For 40 years, most computer scientists assumed that Yao’s conjecture was true.</p><p>Krapivin was not held back by the conventional wisdom for the simple reason that he was unaware of it. “I did this without knowing about Yao’s conjecture,” he said. His explorations with tiny pointers led to a new kind of hash table—one that did not rely on uniform probing. And for this new hash table, the time required for worst-case queries and insertions is proportional to (log <em>x</em>)<sup>2</sup>—far faster than <em>x</em>. This result directly contradicted Yao’s conjecture. Farach-Colton and Kuszmaul helped Krapivin show that (log <em>x</em>)<sup>2</sup> is the optimal, unbeatable bound for the popular class of hash tables Yao had written about.</p><p>“This result is beautiful in that it addresses and solves such a classic problem,” said <a data-offer-url="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/&quot;}" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Guy Blelloch</a> of Carnegie Mellon.</p><p>“It’s not just that they disproved [Yao’s conjecture], they also found the best possible answer to his question,” said <a data-offer-url="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/about/people/sassadi" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/about/people/sassadi&quot;}" href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/about/people/sassadi" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sepehr Assadi</a> of the University of Waterloo. “We could have gone another 40 years before we knew the right answer.”</p><figure><p><span><p>Krapivin on the King’s College Bridge at the University of Cambridge.

</span><span>Photoraph: Phillip Ammon for Quanta Magazine</span></p></figure><p>In addition to refuting Yao’s conjecture, the new paper also contains what many consider an even more astonishing result. It pertains to a related, though slightly different, situation: In 1985, Yao looked not only at the worst-case times for queries, but also at the average time taken across all possible queries. He proved that hash tables with certain properties—including those that are labeled “greedy,” which means that new elements must be placed in the first available spot—could never achieve an average time better than log <em>x</em>.</p><p>Farach-Colton, Krapivin, and Kuszmaul wanted to see if that same limit also applied to non-greedy hash tables. They showed that it did not by providing a counterexample, a non-greedy hash table with an average query time that’s much, much better than log <em>x</em>. In fact, it doesn’t depend on <em>x</em> at all. “You get a number,” Farach-Colton said, “something that is just a constant and doesn’t depend on how full the hash table is.” The fact that you can achieve a constant average query time, regardless of the hash table’s fullness, was wholly unexpected—even to the authors themselves.</p><p>The team’s results may not lead to any immediate applications, but that’s not all that matters, Conway said. “It’s important to understand these kinds of data structures better. You don’t know when a result like this will unlock something that lets you do better in practice.”</p><hr><p><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/undergraduate-upends-a-40-year-old-data-science-conjecture-20250210/"><em>Original story</em></a> <em>reprinted with permission from <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/">Quanta Magazine</a>, an editorially independent publication of the</em> <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/"><em>Simons Foundation</em></a> <em>whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

Raspberry Pi last year announced the RP2350 second-generation micro-controller that debuted within their $5 Raspberry Pi Pico 2 single board computer. Today they announced the RP2350 micro-controller is now available to purchase for your own micro-controller needs.
</p><p>
The Raspberry Pi RP2350 features two Arm Cortex-M33 processors at 150MHz and with floating point and DSP support. The RP2350A 7×7 QFN60 is priced at $1.10 USD per unit or the RP2350B 10×10 QFN80 is priced at $1.20 per unit when purchasing individually. Or if buying the RP2350A on a 13" reel for 3400 units it comes down to just $0.80 USD per unit or $0.90 for the RP2350B. There are also 7" reel 500 unit options for $0.90 or $1.00 as well.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2025&amp;image=rp2350" alt="Raspberry Pi RP2350"></p>
<p>Raspberry Pi is also working on RP2354A and RP2354B variants that will feature 2MB of stacked flash memory. Those Raspberry Pi micro-controllers with stacked memory should be in mass production later this year and available via approved resellers.

<p>The dreaded Akira ransomware attack has had another hole blown through its hull. Blogger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tinyhack.com/2025/03/13/decrypting-encrypted-files-from-akira-ransomware-linux-esxi-variant-2024-using-a-bunch-of-gpus/" data-url="https://tinyhack.com/2025/03/13/decrypting-encrypted-files-from-akira-ransomware-linux-esxi-variant-2024-using-a-bunch-of-gpus/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Tinyhack</a> has discovered a new exploit to brute-force the virus's encryption and has reportedly already used it to restore the data of an attacked company. Akira, a well-known ransomware cyberattack, may now be escapable by affected companies thanks to a GPU-based brute-force counterattack. With an RTX 4090, the Tinyhack found they could crack the encrypted ransomware'd files in seven days, and with 16 GPUs, the process would take just over ten hours.</p><p>Akira is a ransomware attack aimed at high-profile targets, first discovered in 2023 and known for ludicrously high ransom requests (sometimes reaching tens of millions of dollars). In 2023, Avast's Threat Research Team found the method Akira used to encrypt victim files, and published a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://decoded.avast.io/threatresearch/decrypted-akira-ransomware/" data-url="https://decoded.avast.io/threatresearch/decrypted-akira-ransomware/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">free encryption breaker tool</a> to free computers from the dreaded attack. Akira then patched this high-profile crack, adding some bespoke details to its originally publicly-available encryption methods.</p><p>At least one Akira variant uses an encryption method that can be decrypted via the new GPU-based brute-force method over a period of days or weeks. The Akira attack uses the chacha8 and Kcipher2 encryption methods to generate per-file encryption keys, using four distinct timestamps, in nanoseconds, as seeds. These timestamps can be deduced to a tight range of on average 5 million nanoseconds (0.005 seconds), and then precisely found with brute-force, a process which requires the use of top-end GPUs such as Nvidia's RTX 3090 or 4090.</p><p>Several things must go right for those hoping to execute the decryption method. Encrypted files must be untouched following the encryption so the timestamp that the file was last accessed can be found and used for the brute-force. Using a NFS (as opposed to files just living on the network's local disks) can also complicate decryption, as server lag will make it more difficult to determine the true timestamps used by the encryption.</p><p>Using an RTX 4090, decrypting a single file by running through every possible nanosecond in the average range of 4.5 million nanoseconds, finding the correct four timestamps, and generating the appropriate decryption keys takes around 7 days. Affected organizations are recommended to rent servers through services like runpod or vast.ai, using multiple GPU servers to bring the time down. Tinyhack's client took around 3 weeks to successfully decrypt a full set of VM files.</p><p>Ransomware attacks are most often impossible to decrypt without paying ransom, so finding a method to circumvent the attack is a big win for cybersecurity research. While those behind Akira will likely quickly patch this method for future attacks as they did after the Avast decryption release, those already hit by Akira may be able to free infected systems with this method.</p><p>Tinyhack's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tinyhack.com/2025/03/13/decrypting-encrypted-files-from-akira-ransomware-linux-esxi-variant-2024-using-a-bunch-of-gpus/" data-url="https://tinyhack.com/2025/03/13/decrypting-encrypted-files-from-akira-ransomware-linux-esxi-variant-2024-using-a-bunch-of-gpus/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">blog post</a> runs through the entire process of discovering the vulnerability and full instructions to decrypt with it, so please head there to get an exhaustive look at brute-forcing a way into Akira.

						<p>In the early 1930s, Pascual Jordan attempted to formalise the algebraic properties of Hermitian matrices. In particular:</p>

<p>Now, this symmetrised product <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%5Ccirc+B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="A \circ B"> is commutative by definition, and is also (bi)linear: <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Clambda+A+%2B+%5Cmu+B%29+%5Ccirc+C+%3D+%5Clambda+%28A+%5Ccirc+C%29+%2B+%5Cmu+%28B+%5Ccirc+C%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(\lambda A + \mu B) \circ C = \lambda (A \circ C) + \mu (B \circ C)">. What other algebraic properties must this product satisfy? The important ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power-associativity:</strong> the expression <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5En+%3D+A+%5Ccirc+%5Ccdots+%5Ccirc+A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="A^n = A \circ \cdots \circ A"> does not depend on the parenthesisation.</li>
<li><strong>Formal reality:</strong> a sum of squares is zero if and only if all of the summands are zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second of these conditions means that we can say that an element of the Jordan algebra is ‘nonnegative’ if it can be expressed as a sum of squares. (In the familiar context of real symmetric matrices, this coincides with the property of the matrix being positive-semidefinite.) The nonnegative elements form a ‘cone’ closed under multiplication by positive real scalars and addition.</p>
<p>Jordan, von Neumann, and Wigner proceeded to classify all of the finite-dimensional algebras of this form (known as <em>formally real Jordan algebras</em>). They showed that every such algebra is a direct sum of ‘simple’ algebras, each of which is isomorphic to [at least] one of the following:</p>

<p>The qualification ‘at least’ is because there are some isomorphisms here:</p>

<p>Exactly one of these simple formally real Jordan algebras fails to fit into any of the four infinite families. This exceptional Jordan algebra is <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathfrak%7Bh%7D_3%28%5Cmathbb%7BO%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathfrak{h}_3(\mathbb{O})">, the 3-by-3 self-adjoint octonionic matrices endowed with the symmetrised product. Viewed as a real vector space, it is 27-dimensional: an arbitrary element can be described uniquely by specifying the three diagonal elements (which must be real) and three lower off-diagonal elements (which can be arbitrary octonions); the three upper off-diagonal elements are then determined.</p>
<h3>Projective spaces from Jordan algebras</h3>
<p>Given a formally real Jordan algebra, we can consider the idempotent elements satisfying <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%5Ccirc+A+%3D+A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="A \circ A = A">. For the Jordan algebras built from <em>n</em>-by-<em>n</em> real, complex, or quaternionic matrices, these are the matrices with eigenvalues 0 and 1.</p>
<p>We get a partial order on these ‘projection’ matrices: <em>A</em> ‘contains’ <em>B</em> if and only if <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%5Ccirc+B+%3D+B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="A \circ B = B">. This partially-ordered set can be identified with the stratified collection of subspaces in the (<em>n</em>−1)-dimensional projective space over the base field:</p>
<ul>
<li>the zero matrix corresponds to the empty space;</li>
<li>the rank-1 projection matrices correspond to points;</li>
<li>the rank-2 projection matrices correspond to lines;</li>
<li>…</li>
<li>the rank-(<em>n</em>−1) projection matrices correspond to hyperplanes;</li>
<li>the identity matrix corresponds to the full projective space itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>The exceptional Jordan algebra gives us the <em>octonionic projective plane</em>, discovered by Ruth Moufang. We can’t get any higher-dimensional octonionic projective spaces because Desargues’ theorem is false in the octonionic projective plane, whereas it’s true in any plane that can be embedded in a 3-dimensional projective space. We mentioned this <a href="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2013/09/01/pappian-and-desarguesian-planes/">seven years ago</a>.</p>
<p>This hints at why 4-by-4 and higher octonionic matrices have no hope of forming a formally real Jordan algebra: we’d be able to define an octonionic projective 3-space, which is impossible.</p>
<p>What about the spin factors? The idempotents in <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En+%5Coplus+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb{R}^n \oplus \mathbb{R}"> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the zero element (0, 0), corresponding to the ’empty space’;</li>
<li>the identity element (0, 1), corresponding to the ‘full space’;</li>
<li>the points (<em>x</em>, ½) where&nbsp;<em>x </em>is an arbitrary vector of length ½.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, these correspond to spheres! Recall that the real, complex, quaternionic, and octonionic projective lines are (as topological manifolds) just the 1-, 2-, 4-, and 8-spheres, respectively; we can think of the spin factors as ‘projective lines’ built from arbitrary-dimensional spheres.</p>
<p>As for non-simple formally real Jordan algebras, the corresponding ‘projective spaces’ are just Cartesian products of the ‘projective spaces’ corresponding to the direct summands.</p>
<h3>An exotic spacetime</h3>
<p>In August of this year, Blake Stacey posted the following comment on John Baez’s essay:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/stacey.png" alt="" width="720" height="600" srcset="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/stacey.png 720w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/stacey-300x250.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></p>
<p>Now for some context: it is possible to define the determinant of a 3-by-3 octonionic Hermitian matrix, and the group of linear operators (viewing <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathfrak%7Bh%7D_3%28%5Cmathbb%7BO%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathfrak{h}_3(\mathbb{O})"> as a 27-dimensional real vector space) that preserves the determinant is a noncompact real form of the Lie group E6.</p>
<p>This group E6 is transitive on the positive-definite matrices of determinant 1. The subgroup fixing any one of these (without loss of generality, the identity matrix) is the compact real Lie group F4, which also preserves the Jordan product. This means that it maps idempotents to idempotents, so can be seen as acting on the octonionic projective plane as its group of projective transformations.</p>
<p>This group F4 is transitive on the rank-1 idempotent matrices, and the subgroup fixing any one of these is Spin(9). (As a result, we can describe the octonionic projective plane as the quotient F4 / Spin(9). Elie Cartan proved that all compact <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_space">Riemannian symmetric spaces</a> are quotients of compact Lie groups.)</p>
<p>What’s the analogy for familiar (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime?</p>
<ul>
<li>the full group (analogous to E6) is the proper orthochronous Lorentz group;</li>
<li>the subgroup fixing a timelike vector (analogous to F4) is the rotation group SO(3);</li>
<li>the subgroup additionally fixing a lightlike vector (analogous to Spin(9)) is the rotation group SO(2);</li>
<li>the symmetric space (analogous to the octonionic projective plane) is the quotient SO(3) / SO(2), which is just the familiar 2-sphere.</li>
</ul>
<h3>A lattice in this exotic spacetime</h3>
<p>It is natural to consider the ‘integer points’ in this spacetime, namely the octonionic Hermitian matrices where the off-diagonal elements are Cayley integers and the diagonal elements are ordinary integers. John Baez <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/integers/integers_8.html">mentions</a> that this is the unique integral unimodular lattice in (26+1)-dimensional spacetime, and it can be seen as the direct sum <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=II_%7B25%2C1%7D+%5Coplus+%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="II_{25,1} \oplus \mathbb{Z}"> of the exceptional Lorentzian lattice with a copy of the integers.</p>
<p>This lattice was thoroughly investigated in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/imrn/article-abstract/1996/14/665/717554">a marvellous paper by Noam Elkies and Benedict Gross</a>. Possibly the most surprising discovery in this paper is that whilst E6 acts transitively on the positive-definite matrices of determinant 1, this no longer holds when you ‘discretise’! More precisely, the positive-definite ‘integer points’ of determinant 1 form two distinct orbits under the discrete subgroup of E6 that preserves the lattice.</p>
<p>One of these orbits contains the identity matrix; the other contains the circulant matrix with elements {2, η, η*} where <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta+%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B-1+%2B+%5Csqrt%7B-7%7D%7D%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\eta = \dfrac{-1 + \sqrt{-7}}{2}">. [Note: there’s a 6-dimensional sphere of octonionic square-roots of -7. You’ll need to choose one that results in η being a Cayley integer.] If you use this other matrix E as your quadratic form instead of the identity matrix I, this leads to a very natural construction of the Leech lattice.</p>
<p>Specifically, as shown in the Elkies-Gross paper, triples of Cayley integers with the norm <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+x+%7C+E+%7C+x+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\langle x | E | x \rangle"> form an isometric copy of the Leech lattice! By contrast, the usual inner product <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+x+%7C+I+%7C+x+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\langle x | I | x \rangle"> using the identity matrix as the quadratic form gives the direct sum <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E_8+%5Coplus+E_8+%5Coplus+E_8&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="E_8 \oplus E_8 \oplus E_8"> — again an even unimodular lattice in 24 dimensions, but not as exceptional or beautiful or efficient as the Leech lattice.</p>
<h3>Further reading</h3>
<p>To get a full understanding of the octonions, Cayley integers, and exceptional Jordan algebra, I recommend reading all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>John Baez’s articles on <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/integers/">integral octonions</a>;</li>
<li><em>On Quaternions and Octonions</em>, by Conway and Smith;</li>
<li><a href="https://academic.oup.com/imrn/article-abstract/1996/14/665/717554">The Exceptional Cone and the Leech Lattice</a>, by Elkies and Gross.</li>
</ul>
<p>Robert Wilson has also constructed the Leech lattice from the integral octonions (see <a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/wilsonleech.pdf">here</a> and <a href="http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~raw/pubs_files/octoConway.pdf">here</a>). Wilson’s construction also involves <img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta+%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B-1+%2B+%5Csqrt%7B-7%7D%7D%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\eta = \dfrac{-1 + \sqrt{-7}}{2}">, so it may be possible to show reasonably directly that it’s equivalent to the Elkies-Gross construction.</p>
