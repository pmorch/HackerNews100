<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article_text">
            <p>OpenStreetMap (OSM) has been hosting raster tiles of its dataset for much of its 20-year history. These maps have had their rules and styles defined ahead of their rendering and present the end user with static PNGs. Below is a screenshot of the area around the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.</p>
<p><a href="https://tech.marksblogg.com/theme/images/osm_mvt/Screenshot_20241119_124330_Brave.jpg"><img alt="OSM" src="https://tech.marksblogg.com/theme/images/osm_mvt/Screenshot_20241119_124330_Brave.jpg"></a></p><p>This week, OSM began hosting vector tiles in Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT) format.</p>
<p>This allows for the end user to adjust the style and rendering rules as well as extract the underlying information within each of the tiles. Imagery should appear much sharper and switching the language of the labels should become possible.</p>
<p>Below is the same area in Dubai but rendered with OSM's new vector tiles.</p>
<p><a href="https://tech.marksblogg.com/theme/images/osm_mvt/Screenshot_20241119_124340_Brave.jpg"><img alt="OSM" src="https://tech.marksblogg.com/theme/images/osm_mvt/Screenshot_20241119_124340_Brave.jpg"></a></p><p>The raster imagery OSM produced used larger iconography for points of interest (POI) but I suspect it is only a matter of time before the OSM community releases some spectacular and fine-tuned styles for the new vector tiles.</p>
<p><a href="https://tech.marksblogg.com/theme/images/osm_mvt/Screenshot_20241119_124405_Brave.jpg"><img alt="OSM" src="https://tech.marksblogg.com/theme/images/osm_mvt/Screenshot_20241119_124405_Brave.jpg"></a></p><p>This is the current iteration of the tiles rendering with a style sheet that I'll discuss in further detail below.</p>
<p><a href="https://tech.marksblogg.com/theme/images/osm_mvt/Screenshot_20241119_124410_Brave.jpg"><img alt="OSM" src="https://tech.marksblogg.com/theme/images/osm_mvt/Screenshot_20241119_124410_Brave.jpg"></a></p><p>In this post, I'll walk through visualising and analysing OSM's vector tiles.</p>
<div id="my-workstation">
<h2>My Workstation</h2>
<p>I'm using a 6 GHz Intel Core <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/236773/intel-core-i9-processor-14900k-36m-cache-up-to-6-00-ghz/specifications.html">i9-14900K</a> CPU. It has 8 performance cores and 16 efficiency cores with a total of 32 threads and 32 MB of L2 cache. It has a liquid cooler attached and is housed in a spacious, full-sized, Cooler Master HAF 700 computer case. I've come across videos on YouTube where people have managed to overclock the i9-14900KF to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb7pl7PZOYo">9.1 GHz</a>.</p>
<p>The system has 96 GB of DDR5 RAM clocked at 6,000 MT/s and a 5th-generation, Crucial T700 4 TB NVMe M.2 SSD which can read at speeds up to 12,400 MB/s. There is a heatsink on the SSD to help keep its temperature down. This is my system's C drive.</p>
<p>The system is powered by a 1,200-watt, fully modular, Corsair Power Supply and is sat on an ASRock Z790 Pro RS Motherboard.</p>
<p>I'm running Ubuntu 22 LTS via Microsoft's Ubuntu for Windows on Windows 11 Pro. In case you're wondering why I don't run a Linux-based desktop as my primary work environment, I'm still using an Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU which has better driver support on Windows and I use ArcGIS Pro from time to time which only supports Windows natively.</p>

<div id="installing-prerequisites">
<h2>Installing Prerequisites</h2>
<p>I'll use Python and a few other tools to help visualise OSM's data in this post.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$<span> </span>sudo<span> </span>apt<span> </span>update
$<span> </span>sudo<span> </span>apt<span> </span>install<span> </span><span>\</span>

<p>The maps in this post were rendered with <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html">QGIS</a> version 3.40. QGIS is a desktop application that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. The application has grown in popularity in recent years and has ~15M application launches from users all around the world each month.</p>

<h2>OSM's Vector Tiles in QGIS</h2>
<p>You can view OSM's vector tiles, along with an example style sheet in QGIS by clicking the Layer Menu -&gt; Add Layer -&gt; Add Vector Tile Layer.</p>
<p>Create a new connection and set its Style URL to:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>https://pnorman.github.io/tilekiln-shortbread-demo/colorful.json
</pre></div>
<p>Then set the Source URL to:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>https://vector.openstreetmap.org/shortbread_v1/{z}/{x}/{y}.mvt
</pre></div>
<p>Below is what the connection UI should look like. Click OK and then Add to add OSM's vector tiles to your project.</p>
<p><a href="https://tech.marksblogg.com/theme/images/osm_mvt/qgis-bin_StwIB57kOY.png"><img alt="OSM" src="https://tech.marksblogg.com/theme/images/osm_mvt/qgis-bin_StwIB57kOY.png"></a></p><p>Below is a rendering of Dubai with the connection that was set up above.</p>
<p><a href="https://tech.marksblogg.com/theme/images/osm_mvt/qgis-bin_cEKxMUuySP.png"><img alt="OSM" src="https://tech.marksblogg.com/theme/images/osm_mvt/qgis-bin_cEKxMUuySP.png"></a></p><p>The style sheet is optional and without it, QGIS can still render the vector data, albeit with colours it'll pick randomly.</p>
<p><a href="https://tech.marksblogg.com/theme/images/osm_mvt/qgis-bin_h51w6JgL8o.jpg"><img alt="OSM" src="https://tech.marksblogg.com/theme/images/osm_mvt/qgis-bin_h51w6JgL8o.jpg"></a></p><p>The only <a href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/59492">issue</a> I've come across is the rendering of iconography seems to be off. Other mapping tools can render the sprites for this style just fine but they appear as blurry black icons in QGIS for some reason.</p>

</pre></div>
<p>I'll open <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8888/">http://127.0.0.1:8888/</a> and type in the password I set above. I'll click the "New" button in the top right and pick "Python 3 (ipykernel)" to create a new notebook to work in.</p>
<p>Below I'll render the area around the Burj Khalifa again. The POI icons render properly.</p>

<p>Below I'll download a zoom-level 14 tile near the Burj Khalifa.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The MP3, the file type of most songs you listen to on a computer, is compressed. Part of the reason people love vinyl records so much (even though they <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/4/19/5626058/vinyls-great-but-its-not-better-than-cds">don’t necessarily sound “better”</a> than digital formats), is that they are closer in format to the way you would actually hear a song if you were standing in the room with Rihanna instead of listening to “FourFiveSeconds” on your phone.</p><p>Compression happened because (especially in the 1990s when this change was happening) file size needed to be small enough to live on your computer in mass quantities without slowing it down. Now, many computers have the space for higher-quality formats, but the MP3 format has become an industry standard. And information is lost as songs are converted to MP3 format.</p><p>The very first song to become an MP3 was Suzanne Vega’s “Tom’s Diner.” A German engineer played the song over and over again as he tried to squeeze the song into a smaller size without changing its sound too much. Here’s “Tom’s Diner” in its MP3 format.</p><div><p><iframe frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-26hsZqwveA" height="480" width="640"></iframe></p></div><p>The MP3 format can reduce the file size of a song as much as 10-fold, but in the process something has to be filtered out. Which sounds get filtered out of a song to make the file smaller was determined in 1993 by a group of European sound engineers using songs like Tracy Chapman’s “Fast Car,” and Vega’s “Tom’s Diner.” In 1994, MP3s became a public format and, after the advent and widespread use of the internet, they are now the primary format that most people listen to music in.</p><p>But what happened to those filtered out sounds?</p><p>Ryan MaGuire, a a Ph.D. student in Composition and Computer Technologies at the University of Virginia Center for Computer Music, created a project called “moDernisT” to find out. McGuire’s project pulls out those missing sounds and lets them live on their own. Here is the lost material from “Tom’s Diner” as found by MaGuire:</p><div><p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/107845118" width="500" height="375" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div><p>You can hear so many unnecessarily rejected sounds. The buzzing of the small diner, in the first verse for example, and even some of Vega’s softer vocal tones in verse 5.</p><p>What MaGuire has proved here is that the songs we listen to every single day are not the exact master copy that the artist recorded and wanted for us to hear. Instead, they are slightly stripped versions of their art run through a set of standards created by a bunch of engineers in 1993. For many people, that won’t matter. The songs sound almost the same, but the compression of music into an MP3 format is an important question to weigh when considering artistic intent and analyzing songs that aren’t exactly the original.</p><div><p>For a heavier analysis, check out<a href="http://theghostinthemp3.com/theghostinthemp3.html"> MaGuire’s personal </a>findings and his <a href="https://soundcloud.com/magwhyr">Soundcloud account</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>We crafted our first rodent car from a plastic cereal container. After trial and error, my colleagues and I found that rats could learn to drive forward by grasping a small wire that acted like a gas pedal. Before long, they were steering with surprising precision to reach a Froot Loop treat. </p>

<p>As expected, rats housed in enriched environments – complete with toys, space and companions – learned to drive faster than those in standard cages. This finding supported the idea that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2019.112309">complex environments enhance neuroplasticity</a>: the brain’s ability to change across the lifespan in response to environmental demands.</p>

<p>After we published our research, the story of driving rats <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81318943">went viral</a> <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/the-nature-of-things/why-rats-can-teach-us-a-lot-about-relieving-stress-1.6711679">in the media</a>. The project continues in my lab with new, improved rat-operated vehicles, or ROVs, designed by robotics professor <a href="https://www.rmc.edu/profile/john-w-mcmanus/">John McManus</a> and his students. These upgraded electrical ROVs – featuring rat-proof wiring, indestructible tires and ergonomic driving levers – are akin to a rodent version of Tesla’s Cybertruck.</p>

<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=elVzfF0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">As a neuroscientist</a> <a href="https://www.kellylambertlab.com/">who advocates for</a> housing and testing laboratory animals in natural habitats, I’ve found it amusing to see how far we’ve strayed from my lab practices with this project. Rats typically prefer dirt, sticks and rocks over plastic objects. Now, we had them driving cars.</p>

<p>But humans didn’t evolve to drive either. Although our ancient ancestors didn’t have cars, <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1126/science.aad7445">they had flexible brains</a> that enabled them to acquire new skills – fire, language, stone tools and agriculture. And some time after the invention of the wheel, humans made cars.</p>

<p>Although cars made for rats are far from anything they would encounter in the wild, we believed that driving represented an interesting way to study how rodents acquire new skills. Unexpectedly, we found that the rats had an intense motivation for their driving training, often jumping into the car and revving the “lever engine” before their vehicle hit the road. Why was that?</p>

            <figcaption><span>Some rats training to drive press a lever before their car is placed on the track, as if they’re eagerly anticipating the ride ahead.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<h2>The new destination of joy</h2>

<p>Concepts from introductory psychology textbooks took on a new, hands-on dimension in our rodent driving laboratory. Building on foundational learning approaches such as <a href="https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/6-3-operant-conditioning">operant conditioning</a>, which reinforces targeted behavior through strategic incentives, we trained the rats step-by-step in their driver’s ed programs. </p>

<p>Initially, they learned basic movements, such as climbing into the car and pressing a lever. But with practice, these simple actions evolved into more complex behaviors, such as steering the car toward a specific destination. </p>

<p>The rats also taught me something profound one morning during the pandemic.</p>

<p>It was the summer of 2020, a period marked by emotional isolation for almost everyone on the planet, even laboratory rats. When I walked into the lab, I noticed something unusual: The three driving-trained rats eagerly ran to the side of the cage, jumping up like my dog does when asked if he wants to take a walk.</p>

<p>Had the rats always done this and I just hadn’t noticed? Were they just eager for a Froot Loop, or anticipating the drive itself? Whatever the case, they appeared to be feeling something positive – perhaps excitement and anticipation. </p>

<p>Behaviors associated with positive experiences are associated with joy in humans, but what about rats? Was I seeing something akin to joy in a rat? Maybe so, considering that neuroscience research is increasingly suggesting that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12965">joy and positive emotions</a> play a critical role in the health of both human and nonhuman animals.</p>

<p>With that, my team and I shifted focus from topics such as how chronic stress influences brains to how positive events – and anticipation for these events – shape neural functions. </p>

<p>Working with postdoctoral fellow <a href="https://neuroscience.richmond.edu/faculty/stryon/">Kitty Hartvigsen</a>, I designed a new protocol that used waiting periods to ramp up anticipation before a positive event. Bringing <a href="https://theconversation.com/hes-pavlov-and-were-the-dogs-how-associative-learning-really-works-in-human-psychology-86191">Pavlovian conditioning</a> into the mix, rats had to wait 15 minutes after a Lego block was placed in their cage before they received a Froot Loop. They also had to wait in their transport cage for a few minutes before entering Rat Park, their play area. We also added challenges, such as making them shell sunflower seeds before eating. </p>

<p>This became our <a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/20433/presentation/21386">Wait For It</a> research program. We dubbed this new line of study UPERs – unpredictable positive experience responses – where rats were trained to wait for rewards. In contrast, control rats received their rewards immediately. After about a month of training, we expose the rats to different tests to determine how waiting for positive experiences affects how they learn and behave. We’re currently peering into their brains to map the neural footprint of extended positive experiences.</p>

<p>Preliminary results suggest that rats required to wait for their rewards show signs of shifting from a pessimistic cognitive style to an optimistic one in a test designed to measure rodent optimism. They performed better on cognitive tasks and were bolder in their problem-solving strategies. We linked this program to our lab’s broader interest in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOJL3gjc8ak">behaviorceuticals</a>, a term I coined to suggest that experiences can alter brain chemistry similarly to pharmaceuticals. </p>

<p>This research provides further support of how anticipation can reinforce behavior. Previous work with lab rats has shown that rats pressing a bar for cocaine – a stimulant that increases dopamine activation – <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/422573a">already experience a surge of dopamine</a> as they anticipate a dose of cocaine. </p>

<h2>The tale of rat tails</h2>

<p>It wasn’t just the effects of anticipation on rat behavior that caught our attention. One day, a student noticed something strange: One of the rats in the group trained to expect positive experiences had its tail straight up with a crook at the end, resembling the handle of an old-fashioned umbrella. </p>

<p>I had never seen this in my decades of working with rats. Reviewing the video footage, we found that the rats trained to anticipate positive experiences were more likely to hold their tails high than untrained rats. But what, exactly, did this mean?</p>

<p>Curious, I posted a picture of the behavior on social media. Fellow neuroscientists identified this as a gentler form of what’s called <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1476-5381.1960.tb00277.x">Straub tail</a>, typically seen in rats given the opioid morphine. This S-shaped curl is also <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0306-3623(93)90022-p">linked to dopamine</a>. When dopamine is blocked, the Straub tail behavior subsides.</p>

<p>Natural forms of opiates and dopamine – key players in brain pathways that diminish pain and enhance reward – seem to be telltale ingredients of the elevated tails in our anticipation training program. Observing tail posture in rats adds a new layer to our understanding of rat emotional expression, reminding us that emotions are expressed throughout the entire body.</p>

<p>While we can’t directly ask rats whether they like to drive, we devised a behavioral test to assess their motivation to drive. This time, instead of only giving rats the option of driving to the Froot Loop Tree, they could also make a shorter journey on foot – or paw, in this case.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, two of the three rats chose to take the less efficient path of turning away from the reward and running to the car to drive to their Froot Loop destination. This response suggests that the rats enjoy both the journey and the rewarding destination. </p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1010972750?h=e738d94f6a&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479frameborder=&quot;0&quot;" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" title="Enjoying the Ride" width="100%" height="400"></iframe>

<h2>Rat lessons on enjoying the journey</h2>

<p>We’re not the only team investigating positive emotions in animals. </p>

<p>Neuroscientist <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8BYBejUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Jaak Panksepp</a> famously <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s0031-9384(03)00159-8">tickled rats</a>, demonstrating their <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12965">capacity for joy</a>. </p>

<p>Research has also shown that desirable low-stress rat environments <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fnn2061">retune their brains’ reward circuits</a>, such as the nucleus accumbens. When animals are housed in their favored environments, the area of the nucleus accumbens that responds to appetitive experiences expands. Alternatively, when rats are housed in stressful contexts, the fear-generating zones of their nucleus accumbens expand. It is as if the brain is a piano the environment can tune. </p>

<p>Neuroscientist Curt Richter also made the case for <a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/00006842-195705000-00004">rats having hope</a>. In a study that wouldn’t be permitted today, rats swam in glass cylinders filled with water, eventually drowning from exhaustion if they weren’t rescued. Lab rats frequently handled by humans swam for hours to days. Wild rats gave up after just a few minutes. If the wild rats were briefly rescued, however, their survival time extended dramatically, sometimes by days. It seemed that being rescued gave the rats hope and spurred them on. </p>

<p>The driving rats project has opened new and unexpected doors in my behavioral neuroscience research lab. While it’s vital to study negative emotions such as fear and stress, positive experiences also shape the brain in significant ways. </p>

<p>As animals – human or otherwise – navigate the unpredictability of life, anticipating positive experiences helps drive a persistence to keep searching for life’s rewards. In a world of immediate gratification, these rats offer insights into the neural principles guiding everyday behavior. Rather than pushing buttons for instant rewards, they remind us that planning, anticipating and enjoying the ride may be key to a healthy brain. That’s a lesson my lab rats <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/306554/the-lab-rat-chronicles-by-kelly-lambert/">have taught me well</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://cerebras.ai/blog/llama-405b-inference">https://cerebras.ai/blog/llama-405b-inference</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42178761">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Frontier AI now runs at instant speed. Last week we ran a customer workload on Llama 3.1 405B at 969 tokens/s –&nbsp;a new record for Meta’s frontier model. Llama 3.1 405B on Cerebras is by far the fastest frontier model in the world –&nbsp;12x faster than GPT-4o and 18x faster than Claude 3.5 Sonnet. In addition, we achieved the highest performance at 128K context length and shortest time-to-first-token latency, as measured by Artificial Analysis.</p>
</div><div><h3>Llama 3.1 405B on Cerebras Inference highlights:</h3>
<ul>
<li>969 output tokens per second – 12x faster than best GPU result</li>
<li>240ms time to first token<span>&nbsp; </span>–<span>&nbsp; </span>a fraction of most APIs</li>
<li>128K context length support –&nbsp;highest recorded performance</li>
<li>16-bit weights –&nbsp;full model accuracy</li>
<li>Q1 general availability at $6/M input tokens and $12/M output tokens</li>
</ul>
<h3>Frontier AI at Instant Speed</h3>
<p>This year Cerebras pushed Llama 3.1 8B and 70B to over 2,000 tokens/s, but frontier models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3.1 405B have never exceeded 200 tokens/s on any GPU, ASIC, or cloud. As a result, developers have had to choose between second tier models that run fast or frontier models that run slow. Cerebras Inference fixes this. Responding to a customer request to show Llama 3.1 405B on Cerebras Inference at full 128K context, we deployed a instance that broke every record in output speed, long context performance, and time-to-first-token as measured by Artificial Analysis.</p>
</div><div><p>Cerebras Inference generated 969 output tokens/s when given a 1,000 token prompt. This is the first time a frontier model is running at instant speed, allowing entire pages of text, code, and math to be complete in a flash. This result was 8x faster than SambaNova, 12x faster than the fastest GPU cloud, and 75x faster than AWS.</p>
</div><div><p>When the input prompt was extended to 100,000 tokens, only six vendors returned a result with Cerebras being the only non-GPU vendor to complete the benchmark. Cerebras achieved 539 tokens/s –&nbsp;11x faster than Fireworks and 44x faster than AWS.</p>
<h3>Best-in-Class Latency</h3>
</div><div><p>Time-to-first-token is perhaps the most important metric for real-world applications – it’s what users actually experience when interacting with AI. At just 240 milliseconds, Cerebras delivers the fastest time-to-first-token of any platform running Llama 3.1-405B. This is a fraction of what users experience with GPU-based solutions, where initial response times can stretch into seconds. The impact is dramatic: customers switching from GPT-4 to Cerebras Inference report a 75% drop in total latency, dramatically improving the user experience for voice and video AI applications where real-time interaction is crucial.</p>
<h3>Availability</h3>
<p>Cerebras Inference for Llama 3.1-405B is available in customer trials today, with general availability coming in Q1 2025. Pricing is $6 per million input tokens and $12 per million output tokens. Our output price is 20% lower than AWS, Azure, and GCP.</p>
<h3>Open Models Are the Fastest Models</h3>
<p>We’re proud to contribute to the Llama ecosystem and the broader open source AI movement. Thanks to the combination of Meta’s open approach and Cerebras’s breakthrough inference technology, Llama 3.1-405B now runs more than 10 times faster than closed frontier models, making it the perfect foundation for voice, video, and reasoning applications where minimal latency and maximum reasoning steps are crucial. Stay tuned for more exciting updates as we push the frontier of instant AI.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<p><span>Earlier this week, Laura Helmuth resigned as editor in chief of </span><i><span>Scientific American</span></i><span>, the oldest continuously published magazine in the United States. "I've decided to leave Scientific American after an exciting 4.5 years as editor in chief,"</span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/laurahelmuth.bsky.social/post/3lawlkjh6ns23"> <span>she wrote on Bluesky</span></a><span>. "I'm going to take some time to think about what comes next (and go birdwatching), but for now I'd like to share a very small sample of the work I've been so proud to support (thread)."</span></p> <p><span>Helmuth may in fact have been itching to spend more time bird watching—who wouldn't be?—but it seems likely that her departure was precipitated by a bilious Bluesky rant she posted after Donald Trump was reelected.</span></p> <p><span>In it, she accused her generation, Generation X, of being "full of fucking fascists," complained about how sexist and racist her home state of Indiana was, and so on. </span></p> <p><span>"Fuck them to the moon and back," she said of the dumb high school bullies supposedly celebrating Trump's victory.</span></p>   <p><span>Whether or not Helmuth's resignation was voluntary, it should go without saying that a few bad social media posts should not end someone's job. If that were the whole story here—an otherwise well-performing editor was ousted over a few bad posts—this would arguably be a case of "cancel culture," or whatever we're calling it these days.</span></p> <p><span>But Helmuth's posts were symptoms of a much larger problem with her reign as editor. They accurately reflected the political agenda she brought with her when she came on as EiC at </span><i><span>SciAm</span></i><span>—a political agenda that has turned the once-respected magazine into a frequent laughingstock.</span></p> <p><span>Sometimes, yes, </span><i><span>SciAm</span></i><span> still acts like the leading popular science magazine it used to be—a magazine, I should add, that I received in print form every month during my childhood.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But increasingly, during Helmuth's tenure, </span><i><span>SciAm </span></i><span>seemed a bit more like a marketing firm dedicated to churning out borderline-unreadable press releases for the day's social justice </span><i><span>cause du jour</span></i><span>. In the process, </span><i><span>SciAm</span></i><span> played a small but important role in the self-immolation of scientific authority—a terrible event</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-expected-to-nominate-rfk-jr-hhs-secretary/"> <span>whose fallout</span></a><span> we'll be living with for a long time.</span></p> <p><span>When </span><i><span>Scientific American </span></i><span>was bad under Helmuth, it was </span><i><span>really</span></i><span> bad. For example, did you know that "</span><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/denial-of-evolution-is-a-form-of-white-supremacy/"><span>Denial of Evolution Is a Form of White Supremacy</span></a><span>"? Or that the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"><span>normal distribution</span></a><span>—a vital and basic statistical concept—is inherently suspect? No, really: Three days after the legendary biologist and author E.O. Wilson died, </span><i><span>SciAm</span></i><span> published a surreal hit piece about him</span><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-complicated-legacy-of-e-o-wilson/"><span> in which the author</span></a><span> lamented "his dangerous ideas on what factors influence human behavior." That author also explained that "the so-called normal distribution of statistics assumes that there are default humans who serve as the standard that the rest of us can be accurately measured against." But the normal distribution doesn't make any such value judgments, and only someone lacking in basic education about stats—someone who definitely shouldn't be writing about the subject for a top magazine—could make such a claim.</span></p> <p><span>Some of the magazine's Helmuth-era output made the posthumous drive-by against Wilson look Pulitzer-worthy by comparison. Perhaps the most infamous entry in this oeuvre came in September 2021: "</span><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-the-term-jedi-is-problematic-for-describing-programs-that-promote-justice-equity-diversity-and-inclusion/"><span>Why the Term 'JEDI' Is Problematic for Describing Programs That Promote Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion.</span></a><span>" That article sternly informed readers that an acronym many of them had likely never heard of in the first place—</span><i><span>JEDI</span></i><span>, standing for "justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion"—ought to be avoided on social justice grounds. You see, in the Star Wars franchise, the Jedi "are a religious order of</span><a href="https://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2015/10/9/9486477/jedi-coup-politics"> <span>intergalactic police-monks</span></a><span>, prone to (white) saviorism and toxically masculine approaches to conflict resolution (</span><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_duel"><span>violent duels with phallic lightsabers</span></a><span>, gaslighting by means of "</span><a href="https://www.starwars.com/databank/jedi-mind-trick"><span>Jedi mind tricks</span></a><span>," etc.)"</span></p> <p><span>You probably think I'm trolling or being trolled. There's no way that actual sentence got published in </span><i><span>Scientific American</span></i><span>, right? No, it's very real.</span></p> <p><span>But what really caught my eye was </span><i><span>SciAm</span></i><span>'s coverage of the youth gender medicine debate. This is one of the few scientific subjects on which I've established a modicum of expertise: I've written articles about it for major outlets like</span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/when-a-child-says-shes-trans/561749/"> <i><span>The Atlantic</span></i></a><span> and</span><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/06/27/research-into-trans-medicine-has-been-manipulated"> <i><span>The Economist</span></i></a><span>, and am</span><a href="https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/im-writing-another-book"> <span>working on a book</span></a><span>. I found </span><i><span>SciAm</span></i><span>'s coverage to not just be stupid (JEDI) or insulting or uncharitable (the Wilson story), but actually a little bit dangerous.</span></p> <p><span>I know, I know: We're not supposed to call mere words "dangerous." Hear me out: The evidence for youth gender medicine—blockers, hormones, and (sometimes) surgery for minors to treat their gender dysphoria—is scant. We really don't know which treatments help which kids in which situations. Every major government or government-backed effort to look into this question, most recently the U.K.'s Cass Review, has</span><a href="https://cass.independent-review.uk/home/publications/final-report/"> <span>come to this conclusion</span></a><span>. The supposed leading professional organization, WPATH, is mired in scandal, with evidence from court cases </span><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/06/27/research-into-trans-medicine-has-been-manipulated"><span>strongly suggesting it has suppressed negative research results</span></a><span>. One of the leading clinicians and researchers in the country</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/science/puberty-blockers-olson-kennedy.html"> <i><span>admitted</span></i><span> to the </span><i><span>New York Times</span></i></a><span> that she and her team suppressed negative research results (</span><a href="https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/on-scientific-transparency-researcher"><span>not the first time</span></a><span>, I don't think).&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Rather than cover these important developments, </span><i><span>Scientific American</span></i><span> has hermetically sealed itself and its readers inside a comforting, delusional cocoon in which we </span><i><span>know</span></i><span> youth gender medicine works, beyond a shadow of a doubt, and only bigots and ignoramuses suggest otherwise. Over and over, </span><i><span>SciAm </span></i><span>simply took what certain activist groups were saying about these treatments and repeated it, basically verbatim, effectively laundering medical misinformation and providing it with the imprimatur of a highly regarded science magazine.</span></p> <p><span>This was a chronic problem at </span><i><span>Scientific American</span></i><span>. One article, to which I</span><a href="https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/a-critique-of-scientific-americans"> <span>wrote a rebuttal for my newsletter</span></a><span>, contained countless errors and misinterpretations: Most importantly, it falsely claimed that there is solid evidence youth gender medicine ameliorates adolescent suicidality, when we absolutely do not know that to any degree of certainty. As far as I can tell, every article </span><i><span>SciAm</span></i><span> published on this subject during Helmuth's tenure followed the exact same playbook of reciting activist claims — often long after they'd been debunked.</span></p> <p><span>Some of these articles might have done serious damage to the public's understanding of this issue. For example, </span><i><span>SciAm</span></i><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-u-k-s-cass-review-badly-fails-trans-children/"> <span>ran a response</span></a><span> to the Cass Review written by a pair of writers who were somehow able to issue a searing critique of the review despite having clearly never read it. They wrote that the document's problems "help explain why the Cass recommendations differ from previous academic reviews and expert guidance from major medical organisations such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) and the American Academy of Pediatrics." But part of the Cass Review's remit was to evaluate the strength of these exact pieces of expert guidance—the Cass Review explicitly explains why the WPATH and AAP guidelines are weak and untrustworthy. Anyone who read the document would have understood that. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the Cass Review argued that the WPATH and AAP guidelines were shoddily constructed, and SciAm published a response accusing the Cass Review of differing from the WPATH and AAP guidelines. That's the sort of error that can only occur in the context of lax editorial standards married to ideological certitude.</span></p> <p><span>People trust </span><i><span>Scientific American</span></i><span>. It's not out of the question that parents of trans or gender-questioning kids, who are (unfortunately) more likely to get their information on this subject from media outlets than from carefully conducted efforts like the Cass Review, will 'learn' from </span><i><span>SciAm</span></i><span> that blockers and hormones are safe, effective, and likely to reduce suicidality—even as the jury is still out on </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> these claims. This false belief could prove disastrous for obvious reasons, and yet </span><i><span>SciAm</span></i><span> has had no qualms about spreading what can only be described as medical misinformation on this subject—</span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascientificamerican.com+medical+misinformation&amp;sca_esv=31bc3a22d96d9e0a&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1034US1034&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIKTOltf6J_nrlGpiqbJHIhrBLj4Tw%3A1731699526522&amp;ei=RqM3Z6TCH4zIwt0P1uzZsAo&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik_Yq5i9-JAxUMpLAFHVZ2FqYQ4dUDCBE&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=site%3Ascientificamerican.com+medical+misinformation&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiMnNpdGU6c2NpZW50aWZpY2FtZXJpY2FuLmNvbSBtZWRpY2FsIG1pc2luZm9ybWF0aW9uSPxHUNIRWK1BcAR4AJABAZgBrAOgAYIaqgEIMjguNS40LTG4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgGgAnPCAggQABiABBiiBJgDAIgGAZIHAzAuMaAHtSs&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp"><span>something it decries</span></a><span> when the sources and claims in question are right-coded.</span></p> <p><span>To be sure, </span><i><span>Scientific American</span></i><span> was not alone in its abysmal coverage of the youth gender medicine debate. The popular science show </span><i><span>Science Vs</span></i><span>, which bills itself as a swashbuckling effort to cut through politics and get to the truth of scientific controversy,</span><a href="https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/science-vs-cited-seven-studies-to"> <span>repeatedly</span></a><a href="https://carolinacurmudgeon.substack.com/p/sciencevs-revisits-the-issue-of-gender"> <span>debased</span></a><span> itself on this subject, and CNN took such a hard turn toward propaganda on gender medicine&nbsp; that it recycled the same false passage about the supposedly strong evidence base for youth gender medicine</span><a href="https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/why-is-the-same-misleading-language"> <span>in dozens of its articles</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The crisis of expert authority has many causes. But one of them is experts mortgaging their own credibility. When magazines like </span><i><span>Scientific American</span></i><span> are run by ideologues like Helmuth, producing biased dreck as a result, it only makes it more difficult to defend the institution of science itself from relentless attack.

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Basic benchmarks</h3><a id="user-content-basic-benchmarks" aria-label="Permalink: Basic benchmarks" href="#basic-benchmarks"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To run a benchmark, you can simply call <code>hyperfine &lt;command&gt;...</code>. The argument(s) can be any
shell command. For example:</p>

<p dir="auto">Hyperfine will automatically determine the number of runs to perform for each command. By default,
it will perform <em>at least</em> 10 benchmarking runs and measure for at least 3 seconds. To change this,
you can use the <code>-r</code>/<code>--runs</code> option:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="hyperfine --runs 5 'sleep 0.3'"><pre>hyperfine --runs 5 <span><span>'</span>sleep 0.3<span>'</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If you want to compare the runtimes of different programs, you can pass multiple commands:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="hyperfine 'hexdump file' 'xxd file'"><pre>hyperfine <span><span>'</span>hexdump file<span>'</span></span> <span><span>'</span>xxd file<span>'</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Warmup runs and preparation commands</h3><a id="user-content-warmup-runs-and-preparation-commands" aria-label="Permalink: Warmup runs and preparation commands" href="#warmup-runs-and-preparation-commands"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For programs that perform a lot of disk I/O, the benchmarking results can be heavily influenced
by disk caches and whether they are cold or warm.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to run the benchmark on a warm cache, you can use the <code>-w</code>/<code>--warmup</code> option to
perform a certain number of program executions before the actual benchmark:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="hyperfine --warmup 3 'grep -R TODO *'"><pre>hyperfine --warmup 3 <span><span>'</span>grep -R TODO *<span>'</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Conversely, if you want to run the benchmark for a cold cache, you can use the <code>-p</code>/<code>--prepare</code>
option to run a special command before <em>each</em> timing run. For example, to clear harddisk caches
on Linux, you can run</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sync; echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"><pre>sync<span>;</span> <span>echo</span> 3 <span>|</span> sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To use this specific command with hyperfine, call <code>sudo -v</code> to temporarily gain sudo permissions
and then call:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="hyperfine --prepare 'sync; echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches' 'grep -R TODO *'"><pre>hyperfine --prepare <span><span>'</span>sync; echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches<span>'</span></span> <span><span>'</span>grep -R TODO *<span>'</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Parameterized benchmarks</h3><a id="user-content-parameterized-benchmarks" aria-label="Permalink: Parameterized benchmarks" href="#parameterized-benchmarks"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to run a series of benchmarks where a single parameter is varied (say, the number of
threads), you can use the <code>-P</code>/<code>--parameter-scan</code> option and call:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="hyperfine --prepare 'make clean' --parameter-scan num_threads 1 12 'make -j {num_threads}'"><pre>hyperfine --prepare <span><span>'</span>make clean<span>'</span></span> --parameter-scan num_threads 1 12 <span><span>'</span>make -j {num_threads}<span>'</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This also works with decimal numbers. The <code>-D</code>/<code>--parameter-step-size</code> option can be used
to control the step size:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="hyperfine --parameter-scan delay 0.3 0.7 -D 0.2 'sleep {delay}'"><pre>hyperfine --parameter-scan delay 0.3 0.7 -D 0.2 <span><span>'</span>sleep {delay}<span>'</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This runs <code>sleep 0.3</code>, <code>sleep 0.5</code> and <code>sleep 0.7</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">For non-numeric parameters, you can also supply a list of values with the <code>-L</code>/<code>--parameter-list</code>
option:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="hyperfine -L compiler gcc,clang '{compiler} -O2 main.cpp'"><pre><code>hyperfine -L compiler gcc,clang '{compiler} -O2 main.cpp'
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Intermediate shell</h3><a id="user-content-intermediate-shell" aria-label="Permalink: Intermediate shell" href="#intermediate-shell"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">By default, commands are executed using a predefined shell (<code>/bin/sh</code> on Unix, <code>cmd.exe</code> on Windows).
If you want to use a different shell, you can use the <code>-S, --shell &lt;SHELL&gt;</code> option:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="hyperfine --shell zsh 'for i in {1..10000}; do echo test; done'"><pre>hyperfine --shell zsh <span><span>'</span>for i in {1..10000}; do echo test; done<span>'</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note that hyperfine always <em>corrects for the shell spawning time</em>. To do this, it performs a calibration
procedure where it runs the shell with an empty command (multiple times), to measure the startup time
of the shell. It will then subtract this time from the total to show the actual time used by the command
in question.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to run a benchmark <em>without an intermediate shell</em>, you can use the <code>-N</code> or <code>--shell=none</code>
option. This is helpful for very fast commands (&lt; 5 ms) where the shell startup overhead correction would
produce a significant amount of noise. Note that you cannot use shell syntax like <code>*</code> or <code>~</code> in this case.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="hyperfine -N 'grep TODO /home/user'"><pre><code>hyperfine -N 'grep TODO /home/user'
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Shell functions and aliases</h3><a id="user-content-shell-functions-and-aliases" aria-label="Permalink: Shell functions and aliases" href="#shell-functions-and-aliases"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you are using bash, you can export shell functions to directly benchmark them with hyperfine:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="my_function() { sleep 1; }
export -f my_function
hyperfine --shell=bash my_function"><pre><span>my_function</span>() { sleep 1<span>;</span> }
<span>export</span> -f my_function
hyperfine --shell=bash my_function</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Otherwise, inline them into or source them from the benchmarked program:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="hyperfine 'my_function() { sleep 1; }; my_function'

echo 'alias my_alias=&quot;sleep 1&quot;' > /tmp/my_alias.sh
hyperfine '. /tmp/my_alias.sh; my_alias'"><pre>hyperfine <span><span>'</span>my_function() { sleep 1; }; my_function<span>'</span></span>

<span>echo</span> <span><span>'</span>alias my_alias="sleep 1"<span>'</span></span> <span>&gt;</span> /tmp/my_alias.sh
hyperfine <span><span>'</span>. /tmp/my_alias.sh; my_alias<span>'</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Exporting results</h3><a id="user-content-exporting-results" aria-label="Permalink: Exporting results" href="#exporting-results"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Hyperfine has multiple options for exporting benchmark results to CSV, JSON, Markdown and other
formats (see <code>--help</code> text for details).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Markdown</h4><a id="user-content-markdown" aria-label="Permalink: Markdown" href="#markdown"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can use the <code>--export-markdown &lt;file&gt;</code> option to create tables like the following:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>A DNA testing company that promised clients insights into their genetic disposition has suddenly disappeared. The BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7wl7rpndjo">reports</a> it tried several methods to reach the company but failed in this effort.</p>



<p>London offices are closed, nobody answers the phone, and clients are no longer capable of accessing their online records. All the company’s social media accounts haven’t been updated since 2023 at the latest.</p>



<p>The atlasbiomed.com domain appears to be inactive. Customers were only able to look at their test results online, these were not downloadable, so now they are not only unable to see them, but they also have no idea what has happened to that data.</p>



<p>Although there is no evidence that any of the data has been misused, it is worrying to not know who now has access to the data, especially now that the investigation shows that there might be ties to Russia.</p>



<p>While four out of eight company officers have resigned, two of those that remain are listed at the same address in Moscow. That happens to be the same address as that of a Russian billionaire, who is described as a now resigned director.</p>



<p>DNA testing has become so commonplace that many people have blindly participated without truly understanding the implications. It has always been a problem to figure out who you could trust with your genetic data. For some people it’s their cheapest chance of finding out whether they are affected by some genetic disorder.</p>



<p>Since those early days, we’ve had several warnings about how submitting your genetic data can go sideways.</p>



<p>In 2018, MyHeritage suffered <a href="https://blog.myheritage.com/2018/06/myheritage-statement-about-a-cybersecurity-incident/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a security incident</a> which exposed the email addresses and hashed passwords of 92 million users.</p>



<p>In 2020, <a href="https://www.blackstone.com/news/press/blackstone-completes-acquisition-of-ancestry-leading-online-family-history-business-for-4-7-billion/">Ancestry was acquired by investment firm Blackstone</a> for $4.7 billion, which raised questions about the potential commercialization of genetic data and its transfer to new owners.</p>



<p>And the <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/10/23andme-will-retain-your-genetic-information-even-if-you-delete-the-account">ongoing saga</a> of what happened at 23andMe is the clearest example of why people would be hesitant to submit genetic data. In 2023, cybercriminals put up information belonging to as many as <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/10/23andme">seven million 23andMe customers</a> for sale on criminal forums following a credential stuffing attack against the genomics company.</p>



<p>Since then all board members have resigned, except for CEO Anne Wojcicki who has stood by her plans to take the company private, raising again the subject of what happens to customer genetic data when a company is sold.</p>



<p>Data breaches happen to the best companies. So, even if a company has good intentions, there is still a risk of your genetic data being linked to your personally identifiable information (PII). This makes the information a treasure trove for advertisers, insurance companies, and Big Pharma.</p>



<p>All of this makes it very understandable that customers of Atlas Biomed are worried about where their data might end up.</p>



<h2 id="h-words-of-warning">Words of warning</h2>



<p>The UK regulator, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has confirmed it has received a complaint about Atlas Biomed, saying in a statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“People have the right to expect that organizations will handle their personal information securely and responsibly.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, we know that not all organizations will meet that expectation, so there are a few things you should keep in mind.</p>



<p>If you submit genetic material, research the company you want to trust with it thoroughly.</p>



<p>Only share the personal information you absolutely have to provide with the genetic testing company. Lie if you must and create a separate free email account so the information can’t be tied to your main account.</p>



<p>Make sure to familiarize yourself with the company’s privacy policy and opt out of sharing information where possible. Make sure to stay informed about any policy updates or changes from the company.</p>



<p>As a wise lady and one of my former editors once <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/library/blog/consumer-dna-testing-kits-are-a-privacy-risk-now-and-in-the-future">wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Many a friend and family member have scoffed at my warnings to stay away from consumer DNA testing kits, remarking that they have nothing to hide or that there’s no harm in releasing their DNA into the hands of researchers. I honestly hope they’re right.</p>



<p>I hope they never have to fear having their health insurance ripped away because of pre-existing conditions or an increased risk of developing certain diseases. I hope they aren’t inundated with marketing emails about cancer-preventative nutrition or the best new medicines to prolong the onset of Alzheimer’s. I sincerely hope they’re never targeted by racial-profiling police officers, denied a job by a prejudiced employer or buried in paperwork after having their identity stolen by a hacker. And I fervently hope they’ll never have to hide their genetic profile from a government hell-bent on ridding its country of a certain ethnicity or race.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There has been a lot more churn on the November Top500 supercomputer rankings that is the talk of the SC24 conference in Atlanta this week than there was in the list that came out in June at the ISC24 conference in Hamburg, Germany back in May, and there are some interesting developments in the new machinery that is being installed.</p>
<p>The big news, of course, is that the long-awaited “El Capitan” system being built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise with hybrid CPU-GPU compute engines from AMD is up and running and is, as expected, the new top flopper on the rankings. And by a wide margin over its competition in the United States and the rumored specifications of exascale-class machines in China.</p>
<p>A substantial portion of El Capitan – we don’t yet know how big of a portion yet as we write this – with 43,808 of AMD’s “Antares-A” Instinct MI300A devices (by our math) has been tested by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on a variety of benchmarks, including the High Performance Linpack test that has been used to rank supercomputers since 1993. The part of El Capitan that was tested using HPL has a peak theoretical performance of 2,746.4 petaflops, which is significantly higher than the 2.3 exaflops to 2.5 exaflops that we were expecting. (This is, of course, for floating point math at 64-bit precision.) The peak sustained performance on the HPL test is 1,742 petaflops, which yields a computational efficiency of 63.4 percent. This is about the level of efficiency that we expect when a new accelerated system comes to market (our touchstone is 65 percent), and we expect in subsequent rankings in 2025 that El Capitan will bring more of its theoretical capacity to bear on benchmarks as the system works its way towards acceptance by Lawrence Livermore.</p>
<p>As a reminder, <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/12/06/amd-is-the-undisputed-datacenter-gpu-performance-champ-for-now/">the MI300A was revealed alongside its MI300X sibling</a> (which has eight GPU chiplets and no CPU cores) back in December 2023. The MI300A has three chiplets with two dozen “Genoa” Epyc cores in total and six chiplets of Antares GPU streaming multiprocessors running at 1.8 GHz. In the Cray EX systems, all of the MI300A compute engines are linked to each other with HPE’s “Rosetta” Slingshot 11 Ethernet interconnect. All told, there are 1.05 million Genoa cores and just a hair under 10 million streaming multiprocessors on the GPU chiplets in the section of El Capitan tested. This is obviously an enormous amount of concurrency to manage. But it is not crazy. The Sunway “TaihuLight” supercomputer at the National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi, China, which has been on the Top500 rankings since 2016 and is still the fifteenth most powerful machine in the world (of those tested using HPL at least) had a total of 10.65 million cores.</p>
<p>We will be drilling down into the architecture of the El Capitan machine separately after a briefing at SC24 by Lawrence Livermore, and we will crosslink to that story here.</p>
<p>Each Top500 list is a mix of old and new machinery, and as new machines are tested using HPL and their owners submit results, the less powerful machines that were on the prior list fall off and are no longer part of the Top500 universe – even if they are still being used. Moreover, many machines in the United States, Europe, and China that do not do HPC simulation and modeling as their day jobs are included in the list because companies and their OEM partners want to rig the list. Having HPL information on generic clusters is interesting, but it distorts the rankings of supposed supercomputers. To be honest, we have only really looked at the Top50 machines as true supercomputers for a long time and have sought to come up with some way to make this ranking more useful.</p>
<p>Back in June, we decided to only look at the new entrants on the list to try to use this as a gauge of what was happening in HPC. And we are once again going to dice and slice the November 2024 rankings and see what people have recently bought and tested. There are some interesting trends, and we intend to keep an eye on these changes in this manner from this point forward.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2024/05/15/top500-supers-nvidia-utterly-dominates-those-shiny-new-machines/">With the June 2024 rankings</a>, there were 49 new machines on the Top500 list, and of the 1,226.7 petaflops of aggregate peak performance at 64-bit floating point precision across these new machines, seven new supercomputers – and they really were supercomputers doing HPC work – based on Nvidia’s “Grace” Arm server CPUs and “Hopper” H100 GPU accelerators accounted for a combined 663.7 petaflops of peak, or 54.1 percent of the additional capacity that came onto the June 2024 list. Systems using AMD Epyc processors combined with Nvidia GPUs accounted for another 8.1 percent of new compute capacity, and systems using Intel Xeon processors combined with Nvidia GPUs made up another 17.5 percent of the capacity installed between late November 2023 and early June 2024 and tested using HPL. There were another 23 all-CPU machines, which are still necessary in a lot of HPC environments for software compatibility, but the aggregate compute in these machines still only comprised 12.1 percent of all new 64-bit flops.</p>
<p>This time around, on the November 2024 Top500 rankings, AMD is the big winner in terms of adding capacity to the HPC base. There are 61 new machines on the list, and here they are sorted by compute engine architecture:</p>
<figure id="attachment_145003" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145003"><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-new-system-salients.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-145003"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-new-system-salients.jpg" alt="" width="1431" height="1349" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-new-system-salients.jpg 1431w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-new-system-salients-768x724.jpg 768w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-new-system-salients-600x566.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1431px) 100vw, 1431px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-145003">Click to enlarge</figcaption></figure>
<p>This time around, there are only four new Grace-Hopper systems, and they are fairly modest in size and only represent 3.8 percent of the 5,211.6 petaflops of aggregate peak performance for the new machines on the list.</p>
<p>There are, however, 25 new machines that have Intel Xeon CPUs on the host and Nvidia GPUs as offload engines, and these combine to have 969.6 aggregate petaflops of compute or 18.6 percent of the total new compute on the list. Interestingly, Dell built a 5.3 petaflops machine, nicknamed “IronMan,” for its own use that pairs AMD Instinct MI300A accelerators with Intel Xeon CPUs. (<em>Why?</em>) And there are eleven machines that have AMD Epyc CPU hosts supporting Nvidia GPU accelerators, with a total of 247.7 petaflops of peak oomph. The combined Nvidia GPU machines made up 39 percent of the total compute added for the November 2024 Top500 list.</p>
<p>El Capitan and four of its smaller siblings based on the MI300A hybrid compute engines just blew Nvidia away this time around, with 3,134.6 petaflops of FP64 oomph and representing 60.1 percent of the total compute coming all shiny and new to the current Top500 list. Thanks largely to the HPC6 machine being installed at Eni SpA in Italy, <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2024/01/24/energy-giant-eni-boosts-its-hpc-oomph-by-an-order-of-magnitude/">which we wrote about back in January</a> and which is basically a smaller clone of the “Frontier” supercomputer installed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States, there is another 619.3 petaflops of oomph that was added in the November list from two machines based on AMD CPUs paired with AMD MI250X GPUs.</p>
<p>Add it all up and AMD GPUs drove 72.1 percent of the new performance added for the November 2024 rankings.</p>
<p>Now, let’s widen the lens out to the complete Top500 list for November and look at all 209 of the accelerated systems in the list. Take a look at how this breaks down in this pretty treemap:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-accelerator-type-chart.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-145002"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-accelerator-type-chart.jpg" alt="" width="918" height="532" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-accelerator-type-chart.jpg 918w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-accelerator-type-chart-768x445.jpg 768w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-accelerator-type-chart-600x348.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 918px) 100vw, 918px"></a></p>
<p>The box sizes in the chart above represent aggregate sustained performance on HPL.</p>
<p>That green neighborhood in the upper left is anchored by El Capitan and Frontier and includes all machines that use a combination of AMD CPUs and GPUs. Nvidia Grace-Hopper machines are in the upper right, and machines using various Nvidia GPUs are in the blue, gray, and red boxes; Intel GPU machines (the few that there are) are in the teal at the bottom right, and the burnt orange machines are CPU-only systems.</p>
<p>Just for fun, we sorted the 209 accelerated machines on the list by accelerator type and aggregated system counts, peak teraflops, and total cores by architecture. Have a gander at this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-accelerator-table-tnp.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-145001"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-accelerator-table-tnp.jpg" alt="" width="573" height="302"></a></p>
<p>At this point, the machines using the Intel “Ponte Vecchio” Max GPU accelerators represent only four systems (1.9 percent of the 500), but 14 percent of the peak performance, and the overwhelming majority of that comes from the “Aurora” system installed at Argonne National Laboratory.</p>
<p>There are 183 machines that use Nvidia GPUs with any manner of hosts, and they comprise 87.6 percent of installed accelerated machines on the November 2024 list but only 40.3 percent of aggregate peak capacity at FP64 precision. There are 19 machines using AMD GPUs for the bulk of their compute, and that is only 9.1 percent of the accelerated machines. But that is 44.9 percent of aggregate peak FP64 capacity. Thanks to El Capitan, Frontier, HPC6, and sixteen other machines, AMD now has beaten Nvidia on this front on the Top500 list.</p>
<p>If you look across all 500 machines on the list, accelerated systems represent 41.8 percent of machines, 83.4 percent of the aggregate 17,705 petaflops, and 55.4 percent of the 128.6 million total cores plus streaming multiprocessors on the November 2024 list.</p>
<h3>Looking At Broader Trends</h3>
<p>It has been harder to break through the exascale barrier than many had thought, and this is due mostly to constraints on budgets and power consumption, not to any underlying technical issue. The exascale machines in China – “Tianhe-3” and “OceanLight” – have not submitted formal HPL performance results to the Top500 organizers and therefore are not ranked, but they show that if you don’t care about how much power you use or the cost of the machines, then getting exascale machines in the field a few years ago was not only possible, but done. (<a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/11/13/top500-supercomputers-who-gets-the-most-out-of-peak-performance/">Our best guess from a year ago</a> was that Tianhe-3 had a peak FP64 performance of 2.05 exaflops and OceanLight was at 1.5 exaflops.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-performance-over-time.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-145004"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-performance-over-time.jpg" alt="" width="766" height="594" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-performance-over-time.jpg 766w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/top500-nov-2024-performance-over-time-600x465.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px"></a></p>
<p>The bottom of the Top500 list is really having trouble keeping pace with the log plot that we expect for HPC systems historically, and we have no reason to believe that future 10 exaflops and larger machines, should they materialize, will pull up the class average. If we want to get back on the log curve, machines have to get less expensive, and they are getting more expensive even as the cost per unit of performance keeps going down.</p>
<p>This time around, to get onto the Top500 required a machine that had at least 2.31 petaflops on the HPL benchmark. The entry into the Top100 was 12.8 petaflops. Interestingly, the aggregate HPL performance on the list is 11.72 exaflops, up from 8.21 exaflops in June 2024, 7.01 exaflops in November 2023, and 5.24 exaflops in June 2023. Those big machines are pulling up the aggregate performance, but smaller HPC centers are not adding capacity fast enough to double it every two years across the five hundred machines on the list. This may coincide with the rise of HPC on the cloud, or not. It is hard to say without some data from the cloud builders.</p>

<h2 id="updating-my-website"><a href="#updating-my-website" aria-label="updating my website permalink"></a>Updating my website</h2>
<p>It’s been a long while since I wrote anything on this site. The framework I used was <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gatsby</a> which in 2020 was one of the hot ways of getting a good looking blog up and running quickly. With over 41 dependencies, and god knows how many more sub-dependencies, this thing was a beast.</p>
<p>Time to run it after not touching it for nearly 4 years.</p>
<h2 id="how-hard-could-it-be-to-run-an-old-node-project"><a href="#how-hard-could-it-be-to-run-an-old-node-project" aria-label="how hard could it be to run an old node project permalink"></a>How hard could it be to run an old node project?</h2>
<p>Pretty hard actually.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>npm install

&lt;1000 lines of red and failures later&gt;

Failure could not find python2...</code></pre></div>
<p>What? Why do I need python2 to install a node package. What’s it doing? Do I have python2? There probably something wrong with this old <code>node_modules</code> folder. Let me delete it.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>rm -rf node_modules/
npm install

...

Failure could not find python2</code></pre></div>
<p>Okay, you win. I’ll install python2 even though this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>30 mintues later after fiddling with installing python2 using pyenv, hoping to not ruin my python3 setup, I finally got python2.</p>
<h2 id="the-complexity-grows-what-am-i-getting-myself-into"><a href="#the-complexity-grows-what-am-i-getting-myself-into" aria-label="the complexity grows what am i getting myself into permalink"></a>The complexity grows. What am I getting myself into</h2>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>npm install

...

npm remove_cv_t’ is not a member of ‘std’; did you mean ‘remove_cv’</code></pre></div>
<p>What? That looks like C, or maybe C++. Why the heck is C++ code building so that I can install some node packages that just manage basic web files.</p>
<p>Some Google searching and I land on a GitHub issues page for <code>node-gyp</code> and apparently my C++ version is below 14. <strong>That does not seem right.</strong> I’ve got to have something <em>really</em> wrong because I’m down the wrong path.</p>
<p>Then it dawns on me. Do I have the right node version or is there another one I used 4 years ago back in 2020? The only one in my node version manager is <strong>v16</strong>.</p>
<p>I tried doing some Googling on how to know what node version was used in a package.json. Turns out you can’t unless the project specifically sets it.. and I didn’t. Great.</p>
<p>Now all I’m thinking is “Please let me find this node version because I don’t want to start over with this blog site.” Then I stumble upon another GitHub issues page facing a similar C++ compile error. And they mention a broken build using v12.3 and the user should revert back to v12.2</p>
<p>I install node v12 and everything works.</p>
<p>Two hours of my life gone, just to pick up where I left off.</p>
<p>I’m tired and going to bed.</p></div></div>]]></description>

          <h2>Basic explainer</h2>
          <p>Google Scholar is a tool that helps researchers find and read research papers. It started 20 years ago, and it's been growing ever since.  It's like a giant library for research, with lots of cool features. You can even use it to find legal cases, save articles, and follow your favorite authors.  It's been used in some surprising ways, like helping people reconnect with family history and even getting marriage proposals!</p>

        <p data-block-key="7l8nl">Google Scholar, a tool used by researchers around the world, was founded by two researchers. We started Scholar in 2004, physically delivering hard drives to the office (see fact number 2), and two decades later adding new AI features (see fact number 6). To celebrate 20 years of Google Scholar, here are 20 fun facts about its origins, how you can use it and what’s new.</p>

    <div data-component="uni-article-paragraph" data-analytics-module="{
           &quot;module_name&quot;: &quot;Paragraph&quot;,
           &quot;section_header&quot;: &quot;20 things you didn’t know about Google Scholar&quot;
         }"><h2 data-block-key="54fr1">The early days</h2><p data-block-key="5kgpf"><b>1. The team started with just two of us.</b> Back in 2004, access to academic information was difficult to navigate and often restricted behind paywalls. We wanted to make it possible for researchers to be able to find and read what their peers had written. After nine months of development, our vision came to life as Google Scholar, which would end up making it easy for people to discover and engage with research.</p><p data-block-key="fouk8"><b>2. We physically delivered files at first.</b> In the early days of Google Scholar, slow, flaky internet speeds made it hard to gather research to build this online research library. As a workaround, the team embraced a low-tech solution dubbed the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet">Sneakernet.</a>” Instead of relying solely on slow downloads, publishers would load articles on physical hard drives and we would pick up these drives on the way to the office.</p><p data-block-key="atfso"><b>3. A baby set the deadline for launching Scholar.</b> It was crunch time leading up to Thanksgiving, and Alex was awaiting the birth of his son, Nicholas. He was heading out on paternity leave shortly, but we still had a lot of work to bring Scholar into the world. We pulled some all-nighters to meet our deadline — and to make sure Alex wouldn’t miss the birth of his child.</p><p data-block-key="3fuma"><b>4. Scholar’s product motto pays tribute to our fellow researchers.</b> In the research community, we build on the foundation laid by others, hence our product motto: “Standing on the shoulders of giants.” It's a testament to the collaborative nature of discovery and Scholar’s goal to help researchers everywhere readily access and build upon the accumulated knowledge of those who have come before. We hope to always be able to help researchers everywhere see further.</p><p data-block-key="5fp45"><b>5. Our goal is to make Scholar comprehensive.</b> Imagine a library with tons of books, articles and research papers, in numerous languages, from every corner of the world. That’s what we aim to do with Scholar. On its index, you can find peer-reviewed online academic journals and books, conference papers, theses and dissertations, preprints, abstracts, technical reports and other scholarly literature.</p></div>

Now with AI outlines, you can quickly grasp the main points or delve into specific details that pique your interest, explore methods, results, discussions or any intriguing nuance.</p><p data-block-key="4b8k5"><b>7. Unlock the law with Scholar’s “Case law” button.</b> For most of the first 250 years of U.S. history, accessing legal documents was a challenge because they weren't easily accessible. But thanks to Google Scholar's comprehensive case law collection, anyone can explore the laws that govern them. Just select "Case law" below the search bar, type your query and dive in.</p><p data-block-key="1ip9q"><b>8. Copy article citations in the style of your choice.</b> No more manually formatting bibliographies. With a click of the "cite" button, Google Scholar provides ready-to-use citations in a number of different formats. Simply select and use the style you need.</p><p data-block-key="22ure"><b>9. Celebrate research milestones.</b> At Scholar, we know how hard it is to reach the finish line. That’s why we take celebrating milestones pretty seriously and have a <a href="https://x.com/search?q=%22google+scholar%22+balloons+citations&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top">balloon display</a> on the Scholar homepage for users who reach a milestone number of citations.</p></div>

Expand your access to research.</b>Today Google Scholar partners with libraries and publishers worldwide to ensure access to subscription-based articles directly within your search results. And if a free version exists (like a preprint), Scholar will point you there, too.</p><p data-block-key="4huak"><b>11. Create your own research library.</b> With Google Scholar, you can save articles to your personal library with a single click. Organize your research, create custom folders and access your library from anywhere with an internet connection.</p><p data-block-key="65ig"><b>12. Become a research “superfan.”</b> In the fast-paced world of academia, staying current is essential. On Scholar, you can follow specific authors to receive email alerts every time they publish something new. This feature allows researchers and students to easily track new discoveries, trends, debates and stay up-to-date on the latest research from the people who matter most to you and of course your competitors.</p><p data-block-key="ep5f9"><b>13. More papers, not less, during the pandemic:</b> Library subscriptions are usually available only while you’re on campus. Once you go home you lose all access. When COVID-19 hit, researchers everywhere were locked out of their labs and worked from home. Thanks to work we had done with publisher partners on portable subscriptions — Scholar’s off-campus access program — researchers could still get their work done. In fact, during the pandemic, researchers read and wrote more than ever before, leading to a sharp jump in papers published between 2020 and 2021.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        <article id="post-289503">
                                

                            <p>U.S. consumers risk using flooring products made of wood illegally logged from Cambodia’s rainforests, a recent <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2024/10/cambodian-logging-syndicate-tied-to-major-u-s-wood-flooring-supply-chains/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span>Mongabay investigation</span></a> suggests.</p>
<p>The investigation focused on companies in Cambodia’s Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone (SEZ) that manufacture furniture and engineered wood flooring for the U.S. market. One company in particular, Chinese-owned Nature Flooring (Cambodia), sources its plywood cores from Angkor Plywood, our team found. Angkor Plywood is a Cambodian company that’s been accused of illegally logging timber from protected areas like <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2023/12/immense-body-of-knowledge-at-stake-in-cambodias-prey-lang-as-deforestation-soars/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span>Prey Lang Wildlife Sanctuary</span></a>.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“</span>We buy from Angkor Plywood … the company provides eucalyptus and acacia, they have their own plantation in Kandal province,” Jin Tian Liao, a translator for Nature Flooring’s management, told Mongabay. He admitted, however, that the company staff had never visited the plantation. <span>“</span>They grow it, we buy it, we produce flooring and sell that to the U.S.,” he said.</p>
<p>Past investigations have found that <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2020/05/they-never-intended-to-conserve-it-outcry-as-loggers-gut-cambodian-reserve/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span>Angkor Plywood</span></a>, co-owned by former logger Chea Pov and Taiwanese national Lu Chu Chang, doesn’t have a plantation in Kandal, only a factory.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Chang also heads Think Biotech, a company later rebranded to Holy Plantation, that, on paper, has a timber plantation in Kratie province on the border of Prey Lang Wildlife Sanctuary. While Jin indicated Nature Flooring was buying acacia and eucalyptus from this plantation, Holy Plantation has been accused of relying heavily on wood illegally logged from inside Prey Lang rather than timber that<span>’</span>s plantation-grown.</p>
<p><span>“</span>They [Nature Flooring] themselves don<span>’</span>t know what it is that they<span>’</span>re selling,” a timber industry insider told Mongabay, adding that minimal testing is done to check the species or origin of the wood. <span>“</span>If the customers in the U.S. who actually want a green home … realize they<span>’</span>re actually walking on a jungle that they helped to cut down, people will get upset.”</p>
<p>Nature Flooring has had recurring issues with tracing the origin of the wood it purchases. In 2017, the company had to <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2017/08/us-retailers-halt-sales-of-hardwood-flooring-linked-to-illegal-logging-in-png/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span>stop importing wood</span></a> from Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands after being accused of purchasing illegally harvested wood.</p>
<p>At the same time, Nature Flooring’s parent company, Nature Home, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231202055334/https:/www.nature-cn.cn/overseas.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span>claims</span></a> to be a “green” company on its website.</p>
<p>Mongabay’s investigation suggests that Nature Flooring sells the plywood it sources from Angkor Plywood to factories like Fine Flooring, a subsidiary of Pennsylvania-based AHF Products, which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ahfproducts.com/en-us/solutions.html%2523:~:text=AHF%2525252520is%2525252520the%2525252520largest%2525252520wood,,%2525252520hickory,%2525252520maple%2525252520and%2525252520walnut." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external"><span>claims to be the largest U.S. wood flooring manufacturer</span></a>. When contacted, AHF told Mongabay in an emailed response that it “does not use any illegally harvested wood products.”</p>
<p>“We have a rigorous supplier vetting and compliance program to verify all wood products are legally sourced. Any inferences to the contrary are simply not true,” AHF said.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
  

<p>Catches mail and serves it through a dream.</p>
<p>MailCatcher runs a super simple SMTP server which catches any message sent to it to display in a web interface. Run mailcatcher, set your favourite app to deliver to smtp://127.0.0.1:1025 instead of your default SMTP server, then check out <a href="http://127.0.0.1:1080/" rel="nofollow">http://127.0.0.1:1080</a> to see the mail that's arrived so far.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14028/14093249/4100f904-f598-11e5-936b-e6a396f18e39.png"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14028/14093249/4100f904-f598-11e5-936b-e6a396f18e39.png" alt="MailCatcher screenshot"></a></p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Catches all mail and stores it for display.</li>
<li>Shows HTML, Plain Text and Source version of messages, as applicable.</li>
<li>Rewrites HTML enabling display of embedded, inline images/etc and opens links in a new window.</li>
<li>Lists attachments and allows separate downloading of parts.</li>
<li>Download original email to view in your native mail client(s).</li>
<li>Command line options to override the default SMTP/HTTP IP and port settings.</li>
<li>Mail appears instantly if your browser supports <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-socket-protocol/" rel="nofollow">WebSockets</a>, otherwise updates every thirty seconds.</li>
<li>Runs as a daemon in the background, optionally in foreground.</li>
<li>Sendmail-analogue command, <code>catchmail</code>, makes using mailcatcher from PHP a lot easier.</li>
<li>Keyboard navigation between messages</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how">How</h2>
<ol>
<li><code>gem install mailcatcher</code></li>
<li><code>mailcatcher</code></li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:1080/" rel="nofollow">http://127.0.0.1:1080/</a></li>
<li>Send mail through smtp://127.0.0.1:1025</li>
</ol>
<p>Use <code>mailcatcher --help</code> to see the command line options. The brave can get the source from <a href="https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher">the GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<h3>Bundler</h3>
<p>Please don't put mailcatcher into your Gemfile. It will conflict with your applications gems at some point.</p>
<p>Instead, pop a note in your README stating you use mailcatcher, and to run <code>gem install mailcatcher</code> then <code>mailcatcher</code> to get started.</p>
<h3>RVM</h3>
<p>Under RVM your mailcatcher command may only be available under the ruby you install mailcatcher into. To prevent this, and to prevent gem conflicts, install mailcatcher into a dedicated gemset with a wrapper script:</p>
<pre><code>rvm default@mailcatcher --create do gem install mailcatcher
ln -s "$(rvm default@mailcatcher do rvm wrapper show mailcatcher)" "$rvm_bin_path/"
</code></pre>
<h3>Rails</h3>
<p>To set up your rails app, I recommend adding this to your <code>environments/development.rb</code>:</p>
<pre><code>config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = { :address =&gt; '127.0.0.1', :port =&gt; 1025 }
config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = false
</code></pre>
<h3>PHP</h3>
<p>For projects using PHP, or PHP frameworks and application platforms like Drupal, you can set <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/mail.configuration.php" rel="nofollow">PHP's mail configuration</a> in your <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.php" rel="nofollow">php.ini</a> to send via MailCatcher with:</p>
<pre><code>sendmail_path = /usr/bin/env catchmail -f some@from.address
</code></pre>
<p>You can do this in your <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.php" rel="nofollow">Apache configuration</a> like so:</p>
<pre><code>php_admin_value sendmail_path "/usr/bin/env catchmail -f some@from.address"
</code></pre>
<p>If you've installed via RVM this probably won't work unless you've manually added your RVM bin paths to your system environment's PATH. In that case, run <code>which catchmail</code> and put that path into the <code>sendmail_path</code> directive above instead of <code>/usr/bin/env catchmail</code>.</p>
<p>If starting <code>mailcatcher</code> on alternative SMTP IP and/or port with parameters like <code>--smtp-ip 192.168.0.1 --smtp-port 10025</code>, add the same parameters to your <code>catchmail</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>sendmail_path = /usr/bin/env catchmail --smtp-ip 192.160.0.1 --smtp-port 10025 -f some@from.address
</code></pre>
<h3>Django</h3>
<p>For use in Django, add the following configuration to your projects' settings.py</p>
<div><pre><span>if</span> <span>DEBUG</span>:
    <span>EMAIL_HOST</span> <span>=</span> <span>'127.0.0.1'</span>
    <span>EMAIL_HOST_USER</span> <span>=</span> <span>''</span>
    <span>EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD</span> <span>=</span> <span>''</span>
    <span>EMAIL_PORT</span> <span>=</span> <span>1025</span>
    <span>EMAIL_USE_TLS</span> <span>=</span> <span>False</span></pre></div>
<h3>API</h3>
<p>A fairly RESTful URL schema means you can download a list of messages in JSON from <code>/messages</code>, each message's metadata with <code>/messages/:id.json</code>, and then the pertinent parts with <code>/messages/:id.html</code> and <code>/messages/:id.plain</code> for the default HTML and plain text version, <code>/messages/:id/:cid</code> for individual attachments by CID, or the whole message with <code>/messages/:id.source</code>.</p>
<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mail processing is fairly basic but easily modified. If something doesn't work for you, fork and fix it or <a href="https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher/issues">file an issue</a> and let me know. Include the whole message you're having problems with.</li>
<li>Encodings are difficult. MailCatcher does not completely support utf-8 straight over the wire, you must use a mail library which encodes things properly based on SMTP server capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add mail delivery on request, optionally multiple times.</li>
<li>Compatibility testing against CampaignMonitor's <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/design-guidelines/" rel="nofollow">design guidelines</a> and <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/" rel="nofollow">CSS support matrix</a>.</li>
<li>Forward mail to rendering service, maybe CampaignMonitor?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>
<p>MailCatcher is just a mishmash of other people's hard work. Thank you so much to the people who have built the wonderful guts on which this project relies.</p>
<h2 id="donations">Donations</h2>
<p>I work on MailCatcher mostly in my own spare time. If you've found Mailcatcher useful and would like to help feed me and fund continued development and new features, please <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=522WUPLRWUSKE" rel="nofollow">donate via PayPal</a>.

    <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN, I’m Hunter the founder of Regatta Storage (<a href="https://regattastorage.com/">https://regattastorage.com</a>). Regatta Storage is a new cloud file system that provides unlimited pay-as-you-go capacity, local-like performance, and automatic synchronization to S3-compatible storage. For example, you can use Regatta to instantly access massive data sets in S3 with Spark, Pytorch, or pandas without paying for large, local disks or waiting for the data to download.</p><p>Check out an overview of how the service works here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh1q5p7E4JY" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh1q5p7E4JY</a>, and you can try it for free at <a href="https://regattastorage.com/">https://regattastorage.com</a> after signing up for an account. We wanted to let you try it without an account, but we figured that “Hacker News shares a file system and S3 bucket” wouldn’t be the best experience for the community.</p><p>I built Regatta after spending nearly a decade building and operating at-scale cloud storage at places like Amazon’s Elastic File System (EFS) and Netflix. During my 8 years at EFS, I learned a lot about how teams thought about their storage usage. Users frequently told me that they loved how simple and scalable EFS was, and -- like S3 -- they didn’t have to guess how much capacity they needed up front.</p><p>When I got to Netflix, I was surprised that there wasn’t more usage of EFS. If you looked around, it seemed like a natural fit. Every application needed a POSIX file system. Lots of applications had unclear or spikey storage needs. Often, developers wanted their storage to last beyond the lifetime of an individual instance or container. In fact, if you looked across all Netflix applications, some ridiculous amount of money was being spent on <i>empty storage space</i> because each of these local drives had to be overprovisioned for potential usage.</p><p>I tried to evangelize EFS, but I got consistent pushback. Other engineers told me that NFS was slow or chatty and couldn’t deliver adequate performance for their applications. Most of these applications were transferring data from S3 for analysis, and then uploading some set of results. Using EFS as the backing storage system meant that the teams would need to “clean up” this temporary data when the jobs were done.</p><p>At this point, I realized that there was a missing solution in the cloud storage market which wasn’t being filled by either block or file storage, and I decided to build Regatta.</p><p>Regatta is a pay-as-you-go cloud file system that automatically expands with your application. Because it automatically synchronizes with S3 using native file formats, you can connect it to existing data sets and use recently written file data directly from S3. When data isn’t actively being used, it’s removed from the Regatta cache, so you only pay for the backing S3 storage. Finally, we’re developing a custom file protocol which allows us to achieve local-like performance for small-file workloads <i>and</i> Lustre-like scale-out performance for distributed data jobs.</p><p>Under the hood, customers mount a Regatta file system by connecting to our fleet of caching instances over NFSv3 (soon, our custom protocol). Our instances then connect to the customer’s S3 bucket on the backend, and provide sub-millisecond cached-read and write performance. This durable cache allows us to provide a strongly consistent, efficient view of the file system to all connected file clients. We can perform challenging operations (like directory renaming) quickly and durably, while they asynchronously propagate to the S3 bucket.</p><p>We’re excited to see users share our vision for Regatta. We have teams who are using us to build totally serverless Jupyter notebook servers for their AI researchers who prefer to upload and share data using the S3 web UI. We have teams who are using us as a distributed caching layer on top of S3 for low-latency access to common files. We have teams who are replacing their thin-provisioned Ceph boot volumes with Regatta for significant savings. We can’t wait to see what other things people will build and we hope you’ll give us a try at regattastorage.com.</p><p>We’d love to get any early feedback from the community, ideas for future direction, or experiences in this space. I’ll be in the comments for the next few hours to respond!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<a href="https://www.modelscope.cn/studios/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Turbo-1M-Demo" target="_blank">ModelScope Demo</a></p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>After the release of Qwen2.5, we heard the community’s demand for processing longer contexts. In recent months, we have made many optimizations for the model capabilities and inference performance of extremely long context. Today, we are proud to introduce the new Qwen2.5-Turbo version, which features:</p><ol><li><strong>Longer Context Support</strong>: We have extended the model’s context length from 128k to <strong>1M</strong>, which is approximately <strong>1 million English words or 1.5 million Chinese characters</strong>, equivalent to 10 full-length novels, 150 hours of speech transcripts, or 30,000 lines of code. The model achieves <strong>100%</strong> accuracy in the 1M length Passkey Retrieval task and scores <strong>93.1</strong> on the long text evaluation benchmark RULER, surpassing GPT-4’s 91.6 and GLM4-9B-1M’s 89.9. Additionally, the model maintains very strong competitiveness in short sequence capabilities, on par with GPT-4o-mini.</li><li><strong>Faster Inference Speed</strong>: Using sparse attention mechanisms, we successfully reduced the time to first token for processing a context of 1M tokens from 4.9 minutes to 68 seconds, <strong>achieving a 4.3x speedup</strong>.</li><li><strong>Lower Cost</strong>: The price remains ¥0.3 / 1M tokens. At the same cost, Qwen2.5-Turbo can process <strong>3.6 times the number of tokens</strong> as GPT-4o-mini.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-Turbo/cover_en.png#center" width="100%"></figure><p>Now, you can use it through the API service of <a href="https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/getting-started/what-is-model-studio">Alibaba Cloud Model Studio [Chinese]</a>, or through <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Turbo-1M-Demo">HuggingFace Demo</a> or <a href="https://www.modelscope.cn/studios/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Turbo-1M-Demo">ModelScope Demo</a>.</p><h2 id="demo">Demo</h2><p>We have prepared some demos to showcase the new uses that Qwen2.5-Turbo can bring, covering deep understanding of long novels, repository-level code assistant, and reading multiple papers.</p><div><p><span>Example: Understanding Long Novels</span>
<a>Next</a></p><div><p>User</p><div><p>[Upload the three Chinese novels of <code>The Three-Body Problem</code>, which contain 690k tokens.]</p><p>Provide a summary of the plots of these three novels in English</p></div><p>Qwen2.5-Turbo</p><div><p>The three novels you mentioned from the “Earth’s Past” series are interconnected and form a trilogy that delves into the complex interactions between Earth and an alien civilization known as the Trisolarans.</p><p><strong>First Novel: “Earth’s Past”</strong>
In the first novel, the narrative focuses on the development of a top-secret project called “Red Coast” (红岸) initiated by the Chinese military. The protagonist, Ye Wenjie, is a scientist who discovers that the Trisolarans have begun listening to the universe. Her actions, particularly her decision to respond to the Trisolarans, drastically alter the course of human history. She sets up a powerful signal to send to the Trisolarans using the sun as an amplifier. This action marks the beginning of a new era where humanity faces a significant existential threat.</p><p><strong>Second Novel: “Dark Forest”</strong>
The second novel, titled “Dark Forest,” delves into the concept of the “Dark Forest Theory.” According to this theory, the universe is a vast battlefield where civilizations must remain silent to avoid detection and subsequent destruction. The Trisolarans and humans engage in a complex strategic game, with the Trisolarans deploying advanced weapons known as “water drops” (水滴). These water drops are capable of destroying entire planets by disrupting their ecosystems. Meanwhile, humans develop their own strategies, including the “Wall-Bearing Plan” (面壁计划), which involves four individuals who devise plans to counter the Trisolaran threat without revealing their intentions to the outside world. The story follows one of these face-bearers, Luo Ji, as he struggles with the ethical implications of his mission.</p><p><strong>Third Novel: “Death’s End”</strong>
In “Death’s End,” Luo Ji becomes the ultimate guardian of the Dark Forest Theory. He holds the key to the survival of both human and Trisolaran civilizations. However, his position as the guardian (执剑人) brings him immense personal struggle and psychological turmoil. As Luo Ji’s time as the guardian nears its end, he must make a critical decision about the future of humanity. Meanwhile, the Trisolarans continue their efforts to colonize and assimilate other worlds. The novel explores the consequences of this decision and the broader impact on the universe. It also introduces a new element: the creation of micro-black holes (黑域) by humans, which could potentially isolate them from the rest of the universe. However, the effectiveness of this strategy is questioned when six of these micro-black holes begin to move and accelerate towards Earth.
The trilogy as a whole explores themes of survival, technological advancement, and the ethical dilemmas faced by humanity in the face of extraterrestrial threats. Each novel builds upon the previous one, revealing more about the intricate relationship between the two civilizations and the universe they inhabit.</p></div></div></div><h2 id="how-to-use-the-api">How to Use the API</h2><p>The latest Qwen2.5-Turbo supporting 1M tokens is used in the same way as the standard Qwen API and is compatible with the OpenAI API.

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="model-performance">Model Performance</h2><p>In this section, we evaluate the performance of Qwen2.5-Turbo through various benchmark tests and improvements in inference speed.</p><h2 id="passkey-retrieval">Passkey Retrieval</h2><p>We first conducted experiments on the 1M-token Passkey Retrieval task. The results show that Qwen2.5-Turbo can perfectly capture all hidden numbers in the 1M tokens of irrelevant text, demonstrating the model’s ability to capture detailed information in ultra-long contexts.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-Turbo/passkey_retrieval.png#center" width="100%"></figure><h2 id="more-complex-long-text-tasks">More Complex Long Text Tasks</h2><p>We select several datasets of long text understanding to test the model, including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/hsiehjackson/RULER">RULER</a>: An extended benchmark based on Needle in a Haystack, tasks include finding multiple “needles” in irrelevant contexts, answering multiple questions, or finding the most or least frequent words in the context. The maximum context length is 128K.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/infinigence/LVEval">LV-Eval</a>: A benchmark test requiring simultaneous understanding of numerous evidence fragments. We adjust the evaluation metrics in the original version of LV-Eval to avoid false negatives caused by overly strict matching rules. The maximum context length is 256K.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/THUDM/LongAlign">LongbenchChat</a>: A dataset evaluating human preference alignment in the tasks of long context. The maximum context length is 100K.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-Turbo/long_result.png#center" width="100%"></figure><p>The results show that Qwen2.5-Turbo has advantages in various tasks of long context:</p><ul><li>In the RULER benchmark test, Qwen2.5-Turbo scores 93.1, surpassing GPT-4o-mini and even GPT-4, proving its excellent ability to handle long text tasks.</li><li>In more tasks of long context understanding like LV-Eval and LongBench-Chat, Qwen2.5-Turbo surpasses GPT-4o-mini in most dimensions and can process tasks with a context of over 128K tokens.</li></ul><h2 id="short-text-tasks">Short Text Tasks</h2><p>In addition to performance improvements in tasks of long context, we are also concerned about the model’s performance in tasks of short context. The existing context length extension methods often lead to significant performance degradation when processing short texts. Therefore, we have paid special attention to this issue when building Qwen2.5-Turbo, ensuring that the extension of context length almost does not affect the ability of short text understanding.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-Turbo/short_result.png#center" width="100%"></figure><p>Results on short text benchmarks show that Qwen2.5-Turbo significantly surpasses previous open-source models with a context length of 1M tokens in most tasks; compared to GPT-4o-mini and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct models, Qwen2.5-Turbo achieves similar performance in short text tasks while supporting 8 times the context length.</p><h2 id="inference-speed">Inference Speed</h2><p>We tested the TTFT (time to first token) for inputs of different lengths. On the sequences of 1M tokens, we used sparse attention to compress the computation of the attention by about 12.5 times, achieving a speedup of 3.2 to 4.3 times under different hardware configurations.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-Turbo/inference_speed.png#center" width="70%"></figure><h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2><p>While we are pleased to finally extend the context of Qwen2.5-Turbo to 1M tokens, we also recognize that the current model does not always perform satisfactorily when solving long sequence tasks in real applications. There are many unresolved challenges, such as the model’s performance being more unstable in long sequence tasks, and the cost of inference making it difficult to use larger models. However, we will actively explore further alignment of human preferences in long sequences, optimize inference efficiency to reduce computation time, and attempt to launch larger and stronger long-context models. We look forward to sharing new progress in developing long-context models with you soon, so stay tuned!</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

Instead, the menu opened using our no-JavaScript fallback behaviour.</p><p><em>That's strange.</em> 💭</p><p>When we looked into it a bit more, we found out that the bug only happened when her web browser window was on one of her external monitors. She had two external monitors and it happened on both. But when she clicked the button on her laptop screen, the button worked as expected.</p><p><em>What?</em> 🤯</p><p>And to make it even stranger, the bug didn't happen in Safari.</p><p><em>What? What? What?</em> 🤯 🤯 🤯</p><p>So why on earth was something like a user's external monitor set up affecting <code>click</code> events on our website?

It was very strange indeed.</p><h2 id="heading-reproducing-the-issue">Reproducing the issue<a href="#heading-reproducing-the-issue"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>We wanted to be able to reproduce the bug to properly investigate it, so we needed to understand what it was in her home environment that triggered it.</p><p>Since the bug only occurred on her external monitors, we noticed that it stopped if she repositioned them in the OS settings. Her external monitors were positioned above her laptop, so once we replicated that arrangement in our OS settings, we were finally able to reproduce the bug, too.</p><p><em>Bingo!</em></p><p><img src="https://www.joshtumath.uk/images/2024-11-08-multi-monitor-negative.png" alt="Screenshot of macOS display settings.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="section-JpdKgivGGY" data-effects="eyJ0ZXh0UGVyTGluZSI6ZmFsc2UsImhhc0VmZmVjdHMiOmZhbHNlLCJuZWVkc0JhY2tncm91bmRDbG9uZSI6ZmFsc2UsImVuY29kZWQiOiIifQ==">
                <p><em>Navaornis</em> is named after William Nava, director of the Museu de Paleontologia de Marília in Brazil’s São Paolo State, who discovered the fossil in 2016 at a site in the neighbouring locality of Presidente Prudente. Tens of millions of years ago, this site was likely a dry area with slow-flowing creeks, which enabled the fossil’s exquisite preservation. This preservation allowed the researchers to use advanced micro-CT scanning technology to reconstruct the bird’s skull and brain in remarkable detail.</p>
                <p>“This fossil is truly so one-of-a-kind that I was awestruck from the moment I first saw it to the moment I finished assembling all the skull bones and the brain, which lets us fully appreciate the anatomy of this early bird,” said Navalón.</p>
                <p>“Modern birds have some of the most advanced cognitive capabilities in the animal kingdom, comparable only with mammals,” said Professor Daniel Field from Cambridge’s Department of Earth Sciences, senior author of the research. “But scientists have struggled to understand how and when the unique brains and remarkable intelligence of birds evolved—the field has been awaiting the discovery of a fossil exactly like this one.”</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Before this discovery, knowledge of the evolutionary transition between the brains of <em>Archaeopteryx</em> and modern birds was practically non-existent. “This represents nearly 70 million years of avian evolution in which all the major lineages of Mesozoic birds originated - including the first representatives of the birds that live today,” said Navalón. “<em>Navaornis</em> sits right in the middle of this 70-million-year gap and informs us about what happened between these two evolutionary points.”</p>
                <p>While the skull of <em>Navaornis</em> somewhat resembles that of a small pigeon at first glance, closer inspection reveals that it is not a modern bird at all but instead a member of a group of early birds named enantiornithines, or the ‘opposite birds.’</p>
                <p>‘Opposite birds’ diverged from modern birds more than 130 million years ago, but had complex feathers and were likely competent flyers like modern birds. However, the brain anatomy of <em>Navaornis</em> poses a new question: how did opposite birds control their flight without the full suite of brain features observed in living birds, including an expanded cerebellum, which is a living bird’s spatial control centre?</p>
                <p>“This fossil represents a species at the midpoint along the evolutionary journey of bird cognition,” said Field, who is also the Strickland Curator of Ornithology at Cambridge’s Museum of Zoology. “Its cognitive abilities may have given <em>Navaornis</em> an advantage when it came to finding food or shelter, and it may have been capable of elaborate mating displays or other complex social behaviour.”</p>
                <p>“This discovery shows that some of the birds flying over the heads of dinosaurs already had a fully modern skull geometry more than 80 million years ago,” said co-lead author Dr Luis Chiappe from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.</p>
                <p>While <em>Navaornis</em> is one of the best-preserved bird fossils ever found from the Mesozoic Era, the researchers believe many more finds from the Brazilian site where it was found could offer further insights into bird evolution.</p>
                <p>“This might be just one fossil, but it’s a key piece in the puzzle of bird brain evolution,” said Field. “With <em>Navaornis</em>, we’ve got a clearer view of the evolutionary changes that occurred between <em>Archaeopteryx</em> and today’s intelligent, behaviourally complex birds like crows and parrots.”</p>
                <p>While the discovery is a significant breakthrough, the researchers say it is only the first step in understanding the evolution of bird intelligence. Future studies may reveal how <em>Navaornis</em> interacted with its environment, helping to answer broader questions about the evolution of bird cognition over time.</p>

                <p><em>Navaornis</em> is the most recent in a quartet of Mesozoic fossil birds described by <a href="https://www.fieldpalaeo.com/">Field’s research group</a> since 2018, joining <em>Ichthyornis</em>, <em>Asteriornis</em> (<a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/wonderchicken">the ‘Wonderchicken’</a>), and <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/the-last-toothed-bird"><em>Janavis</em></a>. The group’s work on new fossil discoveries combined with advanced visualisation and analytical techniques have revealed fundamental insights into the origins of birds, the most diverse group of living vertebrate animals.</p>
                <p>The research was supported in part by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Daniel Field is a Fellow of Christ’s College, Cambridge.</p>

            Two undersea internet cables in the Baltic Sea have been suddenly disrupted, according to local telecommunications companies, amid fresh warnings of possible Russian interference with global undersea infrastructure.

            A communications cable between Lithuania and Sweden was cut on Sunday morning around 10:00 a.m. local time, a spokesperson from telecommunications company Telia Lithuania confirmed to CNN.

            The company’s monitoring systems could tell there was a cut due to the traffic disruption, and that the cause was likely physical damage to the cable itself, Telia Lithuania spokesperson Audrius Stasiulaitis told CNN. “We can confirm that the internet traffic disruption was not caused by equipment failure but by physical damage to the fiber optic cable.”

            Another cable linking Finland and Germany was also disrupted, according to Cinia, the state-controlled Finnish company that runs the link. The C-Lion cable – the only direct connection of its kind between Finland and Central Europe – spans nearly 1,200 kilometers (730 miles), alongside other key pieces of infrastructure, including gas pipelines and power cables.

            The area that was disrupted along the Finnish-German cable is roughly 60 to 65 miles away from the Lithuanian-Swedish cable that was cut, a CNN analysis of the undersea routes shows.

            It is unclear what exactly caused the fault in the C-Lion cable – Cinia said in a statement that it is still investigating the issue. A physical inspection has not yet been conducted, Reuters reported citing the company’s chief executive Ari-Jussi Knaapila, who told a press conference on Monday that the sudden outage implied that the cable was cut by an outside force.

            “The fact that such an incident immediately raises suspicions of intentional damage speaks volumes about the volatility of our times.

            The extent of the disruption caused by Cinia’s C-Lion fault revealed Monday is unclear. The most important data flows are usually routed through several different cables, to avoid overreliance on a single link.

            A repair vessel is ready to go to the site of the fault, Cinia said in a statement Monday evening. It said it did not know how long repairs would take, but added it typically takes between five and 15 days for submarine cables.

            Lithuanian state media was first to report the cut between Lithuania and Sweden, and quoted Telia Lithuania’s chief technology officer Andrius Šemeškevičius saying that the cable handled roughly a third of Lithuania’s internet capacity. Capacity has been restored since the disruption.

            The cable is operated by Arelion, a Swedish telecommunications company. Martin Sjögren, a spokesperson for the company, confirmed the damage to the BCS East-West link and said that the company is in contact with Sweden’s military and civil authorities about the incident. The cable had connected Gotland, Sweden and Šventoji, Lithuania, he said.

            The issue was detected on Sunday during routine 24/7 monitoring of the company’s network, and the cable is expected to be repaired over the next few weeks, depending on weather conditions, he added.

            Cinia did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for further details. CNN has reached out to the Swedish and Lithuanian foreign ministries for comment.
