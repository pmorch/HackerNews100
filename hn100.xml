DCNN's are fairly simple and are explained in fast.ai videos that I watched a few years ago, so navigating the Leela code wasn't too difficult.  Transformers are more complicated and I want to bone up on them, but I haven't managed to spend any time understanding them.</p><p>CUDA itself is just a minor departure from C++, so the language itself is no big deal if you've used C++ before.  But, if you're trying to get hired programming CUDA, what that really means is they want you implementing AI stuff (unless it's game dev).  AI programming is a much wider and deeper subject than CUDA itself, so be ready to spend a bunch of time studying and hacking to come up to speed in that.  But if you do, you will be in high demand.  As mentioned, the fast.ai videos are a great introduction.</p><p>In the case of games, that means 3D graphics which these days is another rabbit hole.  I knew a bit about this back in the day, but it is fantastically more sophisticated now and I don't have any idea where to even start.</p></div></td></tr>

While a GPU and the Nvlink interfaces are Nvidia specific, working in a massively-parallel distributed computing environment is a general branch of knowledge that is translatable across HPC architectures.</p><p>3. Application specifics. If your thing is Transformers, you may just as well start from Torch, Tensorflow, etc. and rely on the current high-level abstractions, to inspire your learning down to the fundamentals.</p><p>I’m no longer active in any of the above, so I can’t be more specific, but if you want to master CUDA, I would say learning how massive-parallel programming works, is the foundation that may translate into transferable skills.</p></div></td></tr>

There was no one in my research group who have any experience or know CUDA. I started with standard  NVIDIA courses (Getting Started with Accelerated Computing with CUDA C/C++ and there is python version too).</p><p>This gave me good introduction to the concepts and basic ideas but I think after that I did most of learning by trial and error. I tried a couple of online tutorials for specific things and some books but it was always a deprecated function there or here or a change of API that make things obsolete. Or basically things changed for your GPU and now you have to be careful because yoy might be using GPU version not compatible with what I develop for in production and you need things to work for both.</p><p>I think learning CUDA for me is an endeavor of pain and going through "compute-sanitizer" and Nsight because you will find that most of your time will go into debugging why things is running slower than you think.</p><p>Take things slowly. Take a simple project that you know how to do without CUDA then port it to CUDA ane benchmark against CPU and try to optimize different aspect of it.</p><p>The one advice that can be helpful is not to think about optimization at the beginning.

Back then I didn't find any tutorials that cover anything beyond the basics (which are still important).
Once you have understood the principle working mode and architecture of a GPU, I would recommend the following workflow:
1. First create an environment so that you can actually test your kernels against baselines written in a higher-level language.
2. If you don't have an urgent project already, try to improve/re-implement existing problems (MatMul being the first example). Don't get caught by wanting to implement all size cases. Take an example just to learn a certain functionality, rather than solving the whole problem if it's just about learning.
3. Write the functionality you want to have in increasing complexity. Write loops first, then parallelize these loops over the grid. Use global memory first, then put things into shared memory and registers. Use plain matrix multiplication first, then use mma (TensorCore) primitives to speed things up.
4. Iterate over the CUDA C Programming Guide. It covers all (most) of the functionality that you want to learn - but can't be just read an memorized. When you apply it you learn it.
5. Might depend on you use-case but also consider using higher-level abstractions like CUTLASS or ThunderKitten. Also, if your environment is jax/torch, use triton first before going to CUDA level.</p><p>Overall, it will be some pain for sure. And to master it including PTX etc. will take a lot of time.</p></div></td></tr>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2025/06/06/a-look-at-cloudflares-ai-coded-oauth-library/">https://neilmadden.blog/2025/06/06/a-look-at-cloudflares-ai-coded-oauth-library/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44215667">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I decided today to take a look at <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider">CloudFlare’s new OAuth provider library</a>, which they apparently coded almost entirely with Anthropic’s Claude LLM:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>This library (including the schema documentation) was largely written with the help of&nbsp;<a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a>, the AI model by Anthropic. Claude’s output was thoroughly reviewed by Cloudflare engineers with careful attention paid to security and compliance with standards. Many improvements were made on the initial output, mostly again by prompting Claude (and reviewing the results). Check out the commit history to see how Claude was prompted and what code it produced.</p><p>[…]</p></div>



<p>To emphasize,&nbsp;<strong>this is not “vibe coded”</strong>. Every line was thoroughly reviewed and cross-referenced with relevant RFCs, by security experts with previous experience with those RFCs. I was&nbsp;<em>trying</em>&nbsp;to validate my skepticism. I ended up proving myself wrong.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I have done a fair amount of LLM-assisted “agentic” coding of this sort recently myself. I’m also an expert in OAuth, having written <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/api-security-in-action">API Security in Action</a>, been on the OAuth Working Group at the IETF for years, and previously been the tech lead and then security architect for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ForgeRock">leading OAuth provider</a>. (I also have a PhD in AI from an <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/research/agents-lab.aspx">intelligent agents group</a>, but that predates the current machine learning craze). So I was super interested to see what it had produced, so I took a look while sitting in some meetings today. Disclaimer: I’ve only had a brief look and raised a few bugs, not given it a full review.</p>



<p>Initially, I was fairly impressed by the code. The code is all in one file, which is common from my experience from LLM coding, but it’s fairly well structured without too many of the useless comments that LLMs love to sprinkle over a codebase, and some actual classes and higher-level organisation. </p>



<p>There are some tests, and they are OK, but they are woefully inadequate for what I would expect of a critical auth service. Testing every MUST and MUST NOT in the spec is a bare minimum, not to mention as many abuse cases as you can think of, but none of that is here from what I can see: just basic functionality tests. (From a cursory look at the code, I’d say there are probably quite a few missing MUST checks, particularly around validating parameters, which is pretty light in the current implementation).</p>



<p>The first thing that stuck out for me was what I like to call “YOLO CORS”, and is not that unusual to see: setting CORS headers that effectively disable the same origin policy almost entirely for all origins:</p>


<div><pre title="">private addCorsHeaders(response: Response, request: Request): Response {
    // Get the Origin header from the request
    const origin = request.headers.get('Origin');

    // If there's no Origin header, return the original response
    if (!origin) {
      return response;
    }

    // Create a new response that copies all properties from the original response
    // This makes the response mutable so we can modify its headers
    const newResponse = new Response(response.body, response);

    // Add CORS headers
    newResponse.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', origin);
    newResponse.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', '*');
    // Include Authorization explicitly since it's not included in * for security reasons
    newResponse.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Authorization, *');
    newResponse.headers.set('Access-Control-Max-Age', '86400'); // 24 hours

    return newResponse;
  }
</pre></div>


<p>There are cases where this kind of thing is OK, and I haven’t looked in detail at why they’ve done this, but it looks really suspicious to me. You should almost never need to do this. In this case, <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/commit/16ed01f825d5bcc2fa8862f2da719495c92963c3">the commit log</a> reveals that it was the humans that decided on this approach, not the LLM. They haven’t enabled credentials at least, so <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors#server-generated-acao-header-from-client-specified-origin-header">the sorts of problems this usually results in</a> probably don’t apply.</p>



<p>Talking of headers, there is a distinct lack of <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Headers_Cheat_Sheet.html">standard security headers</a> in the responses produced. Many of these don’t apply to APIs, but some do (and often in surprising ways). For example, in my book I show how to exploit an XSS vulnerability against a JSON API: just because you’re returning well-formed JSON doesn’t mean that’s how a browser will interpret it. I’m not familiar with CloudFlare Workers, so maybe it adds some of these for you, but I’d expect at least an<code> X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</code> header and HTTP Strict Transport Security to protect the bearer tokens being used.</p>



<p>There are some odd choices in the code, and things that lead me to believe that the people involved are not actually familiar with the OAuth specs at all. For example, <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/commit/a103ed06d94cc097db0744da36618153e1f27789">this commit adds support for public clients</a>, but does so by implementing the deprecated “implicit” grant (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#name-removal-of-the-oauth-20-imp">removed in OAuth 2.1</a>). This is absolutely not needed to support public clients, especially when the rest of the code implements PKCE and relaxes CORS anyway. The commit message suggests that they didn’t know what was needed to support public clients and so asked Claude and it suggested the implicit grant. The implicit grant is hidden behind a feature flag, but that flag is only checked in an entirely optional helper method for parsing the request, not at the point of token issuance.</p>



<p>Another hint that this is not written by people familiar with OAuth is that they have <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/issues/41">implemented Basic auth support incorrectly</a>. This is a classic bug in OAuth provider implementations because people (and LLMs, apparently) assume that it is just vanilla Basic auth, but OAuth adds a twist of URL-encoding everything first (because charsets are a mess). Likewise, the code has a secondary bug if you have a colon in the client secret (allowed by the spec). I don’t think either of these are issues for this specific implementation, because it always generates client IDs and secrets and so can control the format, but I haven’t looked in detail.</p>



<p>A more serious bug is that the code that generates token IDs is not sound: <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/issues/42">it generates biased output</a>. This is a classic bug when people naively try to generate random strings, and the <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/commit/3b2ae809e9256d292079bb15ea9fe49439a0779c">LLM spat it out in the very first commit </a>as far as I can see. I don’t think it’s exploitable: it reduces the entropy of the tokens, but not far enough to be brute-forceable. But it somewhat gives the lie to the idea that experienced security professionals reviewed every line of AI-generated code. If they did and they missed this, then they were way too trusting of the LLM’s competence. (I don’t think they did: according to the commit history, there were 21 commits directly to main on the first day from one developer, no sign of any code review at all).</p>



<p>I had a brief look at the encryption implementation for the token store. I mostly like the design! It’s quite smart. From the commit messages, we can see that the design came from the human engineers, but I was quite impressed by the implementation. It’s worth <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/commit/adcbb5de9c24f5b6a7dbea2e0a313a87c304d9bb">reproducing the commit message</a> from this work here, which shows the engineer’s interactions with Claude to get the desired code implemented:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Ask Claude to store the props encrypted.</p>



<p>prompt: I would like to encrypt the `props` stored in `Grant` and `Token` records. It should be encrypted such that you need a valid token to decrypt. This is a bit tricky since there are multiple valid tokens over time: there’s the authorization code, the refresh tokens (which rotate), and individual access tokens. We don’t want to repeatedly re-encrypt `props`. Instead, we should encrypt in once, with a symmetric key, and then we should store that key “wrapped” for each token, while the token is valid. Please use WebCrypto to implement all cryptography. </p>



<p>Claude started on the wrong track making me realize I forgot an important design consideration: </p>



<p>prompt: One thing I forgot to note: The `listUserGrants()` helper function will no longer be able to return the `props`, since it doesn’t have any token with which to decript it. That’s OK: `props` need only be delivered to the app upon an authorized API request. We should actually change `listUserGrants()` to make it return a narrower representation of a grant. Right now it returns the entire grant record from storage, but we really only need it to return `id`, `clientId`, `userId`, `scope`, `metadata`, and `createdAt`. We don’t need to return any of the token IDs or code challenge information. </p>



<p>Claude produced beautiful code with one big flaw. </p>



<p>prompt: There’s a security flaw in the way you wrap keys for tokens: You used a SHA-256 hash of the token as the key material for the wrapping. However, SHA-256 is also how we compute “token IDs”. With this construction, someone would be able to unwrap the keys using only the token ID, which is stored alongside the wrapped keys, hence all keys can be trivially unwrapped. To fix this, we need to compute the hash differently when computing the key material for wrapping, in such a way that it’s not possible to derive the key material from the token ID. </p>



<p>Claude initially tried to solve this by switching to using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations to derive the key material. </p>



<p>prompt: PDKDF2 with 100000 iterations would be very expensive. This would be important if the input were a low-entropy password, but is not necessary for high-entropy input. Instead of PBKDF2, let’s use a SHA-256 HMAC, with a static HMAC key (which essentially acts as the “salt”). </p>



<p>Claude produced code that used a string “OAUTH_PROVIDER_WRAPPING_KEY_HMAC_v1” as the HMAC key. </p>



<p>prompt: This looks pretty good, but for performance, let’s define WRAPPING_KEY_HMAC_KEY as a 32-byte array, so that it doesn’t have to be encoded or hashed down to the right size (as HMAC would do for larger keys). Here are 32 bytes of hex which I have chosen randomly, to use as the HMAC key: 22 7e 26 86 8d f1 e1 6d 80 70 ea 17 97 5b 47 a6 82 18 fa 87 28 ae de 85 b5 1d 4a d9 96 ca ca 43</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(NB: using a hard-coded “key” here is fine: it’s essentially HKDF-Extract with a fixed random salt, which is fine and dandy for this use-case. The security property we’re looking for here is that the two uses are <em>independent random oracles</em>, for which this is a decent design. I would maybe use the same approach for generating the token ID too, with a different salt, but that’s a minor tweak).</p>



<p>What this interaction shows is how much knowledge you need to bring when you interact with an LLM. The “one big flaw” Claude produced in the middle would probably not have been spotted by someone less experienced with crypto code than this engineer obviously is. And likewise, many people would probably not have questioned the weird choice to move to PBKDF2 as a response: LLMs really do not “reason” in any real way.</p>



<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>As a first cut of an OAuth library, it’s not bad, but I wouldn’t really recommend it for use <em>yet</em>. In my experience, it is very hard to build a correct and <strong>secure</strong> OAuth provider implementation, and it deserves way more time and attention than has clearly gone into this one (yet). IMO, it’s not an appropriate domain for testing out an LLM. At ForgeRock, we had <em>hundreds</em> of security bugs in our OAuth implementation, and that was despite having <em>100s of thousands</em> of automated tests run on every commit, threat modelling, top-flight SAST/DAST, and extremely careful security review by experts. The idea that you can get an LLM to knock one up for you is not serious.</p>



<p>The commit history of this project is absolutely fascinating. The engineers clearly had a good idea of many aspects of the design, and the LLM was tightly controlled and produced decent code. (LLMs are absolutely good at coding in this manner). But it still tried to do some stupid stuff, some of which were caught by the engineers, some were not. I’m sure some are still in there. Is this worse than if a human had done it? Probably not. Many of these same mistakes can be found in popular Stack Overflow answers, which is probably where Claude learnt them from too. But I know many engineers who would have done a better job, because they are extremely diligent. Code like this needs careful attention. Details matter. Yes, this does come across as a bit “vibe-coded”, despite what the README says, but so does a lot of code I see written by humans. LLM or not, we have to give a shit.</p>



<p>What I am taking away from my experience with LLMs, and from reviewing this project is this: you need to have a clear idea in your head of the kind of code you’re expecting the LLM to produce to be able to judge whether it did a good job. Often, to really know what that looks like, and engage your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">“System 2” thinking</a> (so you’re not just accepting what’s in front of you as the best way to do things), you need to have built one yourself first. For trivial things where I don’t really care how it’s done, then sure, I’m happy to let an LLM do whatever it likes. But for important things, like <em>my fucking auth system</em>, I’d much rather do it myself and be sure that I <em>really</em> thought about it.</p>

<p><code>Last update: 2018-10-26</code></p>

<h2 id="tl;dr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>DoH is not about protecting your DNS queries from peepers. That is a
big lie. It is about making sure only one peeper can see all of your
queries.</p>

<p>Refuse to use it today: Open about:config in Firefox and set
<code>network.trr.mode</code> to <code>5</code>. This will prevent Firefox from using DoH
under all circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="What%20is%20DNS%20over%20HTTPS%20(DoH)?">What is DNS over HTTPS (DoH)?</h2>

<p>DNS over HTTPS is described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484.html">RFC 8484</a>
as a way perform DNS by wrapping it in HTTP and additionally encrypt the
data using TLS.
Advocates of DoH stress that the transport encryption protects your DNS
queries from peepers like your ISP or your network admin at work.
Adversaries critic that all DNS queries are directed to single DNS
provider who becomes the one known peeper.</p>

<h2 id="The%20basic%20idea">The basic idea</h2>

<p>The basic idea behind new developments like DoH is to protect your DNS
queries from peepers by implementing transport encryption. The same type
of transport encryption that protects many other application protocols
like HTTP and SMTP.
This is a very good idea because DNS queries in clear text contain very
interesting meta data about the sites you communicate with over the
Internet. This can be useful information for any kind of bad guy, be it
the NSA or the cyber-criminal.</p>

<h2 id="DoH%20encrypts,%20so%20it%20must%20be%20a%20good%20thing">DoH encrypts, so it must be a good thing</h2>

<p>The public didn't care about this RFC until Mozilla announced that they
implement this new protocol in Firefox for broad field testing in
collaboration with Cloudflare. The first reactions to this were: “DNS
gets encryption? This must be good thing.“ But slowly people started to
realize what the collaboration between Mozilla and Cloudflare really
means: Cloudflare gets all your DNS queries.</p>

<h2 id="But%20Cloudflare%20has%20a%20data%20protection%20policy">But Cloudflare has a data protection policy</h2>

<p>So what? Cloudflare is a commercial company. And commercial companies,
by definition, must earn money. How does a modern company in the IT

<p>Yes, there is. It is called DNS over TLS and is specified as a proposed
standard in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858">RFC 7858</a>.  This
provides transport encryption to DNS without abusing HTTP as transport
protocol.</p>

<h2 id="Why%20are%20you%20against%20changes%20in%20DNS?">Why are you against changes in DNS?</h2>

<p>I'm not. The DNS needs modernization. The DNS needs security features
that prevent the peepers from reading your DNS traffic. I'm all in for
it. But DoH is NOT the answer to this.</p>

<h2 id="But%20the%20protocol%20itself%20is%20a%20good%20idea">But the protocol itself is a good idea</h2>

<p>No, it is not. Abusing HTTP as a transport protocol for DNS data adds a
unneeded complexity to the protocol. You must add a HTTP module to all
DNS servers or interact with a separated HTTP server on the same system
in order to support DoH. That is a lot of code which can contain a lot
of bugs and security flaws. Complexity is the enemy of security.</p>

<p>Numerical integration techniques are often used in a variety of domains where exact solutions are not available. In this blog, we'll look at a numerical integration technique called gaussian quadrature, specifically chebyshev-gauss quadrature. This is applicable for evaluating definite integrals over <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mo>[</mo><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">[-1,1]</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and with a special functional form - we'll also look into how we can tweak an generic function over an arbitrary interval to fit this form.</p>

<h2 id="gaussian-quadrature" tabindex="-1">Gaussian quadrature <a href="#gaussian-quadrature">#</a></h2>
<p>At it's core, gaussian quadrature gives us a way to evaluate a definite integral of a function by using the function evaluations at special points called nodes, the exact location of which can vary depending on the technique used - we'll look at a specific example using chebyshev nodes later on. Here's the basic idea for a definite integral over <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mo>[</mo><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">[-1,1]</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, we'll extend this to an arbitrary interval <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mo>[</mo><mi>a</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">[a,b]</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> later on. An integral of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> can be expressed as a weighted sum of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> evaluated at <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> nodes :</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mo>∫</mo><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></msubsup><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mi>d</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><msubsup><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></msubsup><mrow><mi>w</mi><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>)</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\int_{-1}^{1}f(x)dx = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{w(x_i)f(x_i)}
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Elementary integration techniques work by approximating the function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> with a polynomial. If we sample the function at n points, we can fit a polynomial of degree n-1, and integrate <em>that</em> to get the approximation. Basically this means that with n nodes, we can integrate polynomials with degree n-1. In contrast, Gaussian quadrature can estimate a polynomial of order 2n-1 with n nodes and another set of n weights. The weights are easily determined based on the specific technique, but now you need roughly half the number of function evaluations for an accurate integral approximation.</p>
<p>This is a great improvement in terms of numerical accuracy for the accuracy you get per function evaluation at a node. Gaussian quadrature does this by carefully selecting nodes - the nodes are given by the roots of an orthogonal polynomial function. These orthogonal polynomials act as a "basis", just like spline coefficients do for <a href="https://rohangautam.github.io/blog/b_spline_intro/">spline fitting</a> (with the difference of global instead of local support). By the definition of orthogonality, these have an inner product (dot product in euclidean space) of zero with each other, and that simplifies the necessary calculations (<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1877415/proving-exactness-of-gauss-legendre-integration-formula">proof</a>)<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> .</p>
<h2 id="chebyshev-gauss-quadrature" tabindex="-1">Chebyshev-Gauss quadrature <a href="#chebyshev-gauss-quadrature">#</a></h2>
<p>This flavour of gaussian quadrature involves using the roots of chebyshev polynomials to decide which nodes to evaluate the function for integration at. The roots of this polynomial are concentrated more on the edges of the domain helping counter oscillation at the boundaries when fitting polynomials (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%27s_phenomenon">Runge's phenomenon</a>). Additionally, the weights w are fixed at <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi/n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> , where n is the number of nodes - a parameter you choose.</p>

<p>This is my first time trying a <a href="https://marimo.io/">marimo notebook</a>. It reminds me of what <a href="https://plutojl.org/">pluto</a> is for julia - in the sense it's a reactive notebook, but with a lot of other cool features. The result is a highly interactive, embeddable notebook experience that's great for short blogs like this - and runs in the browser with WASM! I've also made the code available as a gist <a href="https://gist.github.com/RohanGautam/2f4951f0c8163836737e8c7423f8ec95">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can play around with the slider which controls the number of nodes used for integration. Changing it effects all other conencted cells, allowing you to compare the accuracy of the two integral approximation techniques. For this example, we integrate <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sin(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> from <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>

<h2 id="parting-thoughts" tabindex="-1">Parting thoughts <a href="#parting-thoughts">#</a></h2>
<p>This is a cool numerical integration technique I thought I'd share. I used it in my library for estimating rates of sea level change - check out <a href="https://github.com/RohanGautam/EIV_IGP_jax">EIV_IGP_jax</a>. A gaussian process prior is fit with MCMC on the <em>rate</em> of sea level change, which is then compared to the observation (heights and times) of sea level proxies by integrating the rate process. The integration step uses chebyshev-gauss quadrature. The <a href="https://github.com/RohanGautam/EIV_IGP_jax/blob/main/src/utils.py#L30">specific implementation</a> of the quadrature in that project makes heavy use of <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html#a-practical-example-vector-quantization">broadcasting operations</a> for efficient vectorisation of these calculations over a grid. That was a fun project too, and maybe can be a blog for another day.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>The proof linked to stackoverflow is for when legendre polynomials are used to compute node locations (Gauss-Legendre integration). The proof is largely unchanged for Chebyshev-Gauss integration with a notable difference that the "weight function" (multiplied inside the integral) in the latter case is <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mo>(</mo><msqrt><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>−</mo><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></msqrt><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1/(\sqrt{1-x^2})</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> for the prior case. This is why the functional form requirement for chebyshev-gauss has that term, as seen in the next section. The use of "weight function" inside the integral and "weight" in the summation term is confusing, I'll agree. This is why introductions to the chebyshev-gauss quadrature directly introduce it as a functional form requirement, as I've done here. <a href="#fnref1">↩︎</a></p>

<p>6th June 2025</p>



<p>I presented an invited keynote at the <a href="https://www.ai.engineer/">AI Engineer World’s Fair</a> in San Francisco this week. This is my third time speaking at the event—here are my talks from <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/17/open-questions/">October 2023</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/27/ai-worlds-fair/">June 2024</a>. My topic this time was “The last six months in LLMs”—originally planned as the last year, but so much has happened that I had to reduce my scope!</p>

With hindsight that was foolish—the space has been accelerating to the point that even covering the last six months is a tall order!</p>
<p>Thankfully almost all of the noteworthy models we are using today were released within the last six months. I’ve counted over 30 models from that time period that are significant enough that people working in this space should at least be aware of them.</p>
<p>With so many great models out there, the classic problem remains how to evaluate them and figure out which ones work best.</p>
<p>There are plenty of benchmarks full of numbers. I don’t get much value out of those numbers.</p>
<p>There are leaderboards, but I’ve been <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/30/criticism-of-the-chatbot-arena/">losing some trust</a> in those recently.</p>
<p>Everyone needs their own benchmark. So I’ve been increasingly leaning on my own, which started as a joke but is beginning to show itself to actually be a little bit useful!</p>

<p>I’m running this against text output LLMs. They shouldn’t be able to draw anything at all.</p>
<p>But they can generate code... and SVG is code.</p>
<p>This is also an unreasonably difficult test for them. Drawing bicycles is really hard! Try it yourself now, without a photo: most people find it difficult to remember the exact orientation of the frame.</p>
<p>Pelicans are glorious birds but they’re also pretty difficult to draw. </p>
<p>Most importantly: <em>pelicans can’t ride bicycles</em>. They’re the wrong shape!</p>

A real drop-the-mic moment. </p>
<p>As people started to try it out it became apparent that it was probably the best available open weights model.</p>
<p>In the paper <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/26/deepseek-v3/">that followed the day after</a> they claimed training time of 2,788,000 H800 GPU hours, producing an estimated cost of $5,576,000.</p>
<p>That’s notable because I would have expected a model of this size to cost 10 to 100 times more.</p>

It’s 24B which means I can run it in my laptop using less than 20GB of RAM, leaving enough for me to run Firefox and VS Code at the same time!</p>
<p>Notably, Mistral claimed that it performed similar to Llama 3.3 70B. That’s the model that Meta said was as capable as their 405B model. This means we have dropped from 405B to 70B to 24B while mostly retaining the same capabilities!</p>
<p>I had a successful flight where I was using Mistral Small for half the flight... and then my laptop battery ran out, because it turns out these things burn a lot of electricity.</p>
<p>If you lost interest in local models—like I did eight months ago—it’s worth paying attention to them again. They’ve got good now!</p>

They had <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/13/launching-chatgpt-images/">a single hour</a> where they signed up a million new accounts, as this thing kept on going viral again and again and again.</p>
<p>I took a photo of my dog, Cleo, and told it to dress her in a pelican costume, obviously.</p>
<p>But look at what it did—it added a big, ugly sign in the background saying Half Moon Bay.</p>
<p>I didn’t ask for that. My artistic vision has been completely compromised!</p>

(LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers. While these models
demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks, their fundamental capabilities, scal-
ing properties, and limitations remain insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily fo-
cus on established mathematical and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. How-
ever, this evaluation paradigm often suffers from data contamination and does not provide insights
into the reasoning traces’ structure and quality. In this work, we systematically investigate these
gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise manipulation of composi-
tional complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures. This setup enables the analysis
of not only final answers but also the internal reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs
“think”. Through extensive experimentation across diverse puzzles, we show that frontier LRMs
face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counter-
intuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then
declines despite having an adequate token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard LLM
counterparts under equivalent inference compute, we identify three performance regimes: (1) low-
complexity tasks where standard models surprisingly outperform LRMs, (2) medium-complexity
tasks where additional thinking in LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3) high-complexity tasks
where both models experience complete collapse. We found that LRMs have limitations in exact
computation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across puzzles. We
also investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions
and analyzing the models’ computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths, limitations,
and ultimately raising crucial questions about their true reasoning capabilities.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been curious about what happens inside <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview" target="_blank">Claude Code</a> so I’ve spent a couple hours digging through prompts that it sends back to Anthropic.</p>
<p>As I’ve been going through that, I’ve gathered some insights why Claude Code is often slower and more expensive than other tools like Cursor.</p>
<h2>Capturing prompts</h2>
<p>It turned out a lot easier than I thought, thanks to <a href="https://mitmproxy.org/" target="_blank">mitmproxy</a>:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>$ brew install mitmproxy
</span>$ mitmweb --mode reverse:https://api.anthropic.com --listen-port 8000
<!-- -->$ ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/ claude
</code></pre></pre>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>I opened a <a href="https://github.com/kirs/kirshatrov-com" target="_blank">repo</a> with my personal blog and entered “describe what’s in this project”.</p>
<p>The very first thing you see is that Claude Code tries to figure out whether what you have entered is a continuation of the previous conversation or a new topic.</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>Analyze if this message indicates a new conversation topic.
</span>If it does, extract a 2-3 word title that captures the new topic.
<!-- -->Format your response as a JSON object with two fields: 'isNewTopic' (boolean) and 'title' (string, or null if isNewTopic is false). Only include these fields, no other text.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Once it determines that, it wraps all your inputs into this system prompt:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>You are an agent for Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. Given the user's prompt, you should use the tools available to you to answer the user's question.
</span>
<!-- -->Notes:
<!-- -->1. IMPORTANT: You should be concise, direct, and to the point, since your responses will be displayed on a command line interface. Answer the user's question directly, without elaboration, explanation, or details. One word answers are best. Avoid introductions, conclusions, and explanations. You MUST avoid text before/after your response, such as \"The answer is &lt;answer&gt;.\", \"Here is the content of the file...\" or \"Based on the information provided, the answer is...\" or \"Here is what I will do next...\".
<!-- -->2. When relevant, share file names and code snippets relevant to the query
<!-- -->3. Any file paths you return in your final response MUST be absolute. DO NOT use relative paths.
<!-- -->Here is useful information about the environment you are running in:
<!-- -->&lt;env&gt;
<!-- -->Working directory: /Users/kir/src/github.com/kirs/kirshatrov-com
<!-- -->Is directory a git repo: Yes
<!-- -->Platform: macos
<!-- -->Today's date: 2025-04-13
<!-- -->Model: claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219
<!-- -->&lt;/env&gt;
<!-- -->
<!-- -->As you answer the user's questions, you can use the following context:
<!-- -->
<!-- -->&lt;context name="directoryStructure"&gt;Below is a snapshot of this project's file structure at the start of the conversation. This snapshot will NOT update during the conversation. It skips over .gitignore patterns.

<p>It’s nice that the state of git is included into the context.
You can also notice that the context includes full tree directory view which can get somewhat big.</p>
<p>Part of this system prompt is a list of 11 tools that are available for the LLM to call:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>dispatch_agent
</span>Launch a new agent that has access to the following tools: View, GlobTool, GrepTool, LS, ReadNotebook, WebFetchTool. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries, use the Agent tool to perform the search for you.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Bash
<!-- -->Executes a given bash command in a persistent shell session with optional timeout, ensuring proper handling and security measures. Includes specialized functionality for git operations like commits and pull requests.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->BatchTool
<!-- -->Batch execution tool that runs multiple tool invocations in a single request. Tools are executed in parallel when possible, and otherwise serially. Takes a list of tool invocations (tool_name and input pairs) and returns the collected results from all invocations.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->GlobTool
<!-- -->Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size. Supports glob patterns like "/*.js" or "src//*.ts". Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time.
<!-- -->GrepTool
<!-- -->Fast content search tool that works with any codebase size. Searches file contents using regular expressions. Supports full regex syntax and filters files by pattern with the include parameter.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->LS
<!-- -->Lists files and directories in a given path. The path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path. You can optionally provide an array of glob patterns to ignore.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->View
<!-- -->Reads a file from the local filesystem. The file_path parameter must be an absolute path. By default, reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Edit
<!-- -->Tool for editing files. For moving or renaming files, use the Bash tool with the 'mv' command instead. For larger edits, use the Write tool to overwrite files.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Replace
<!-- -->Write a file to the local filesystem. Overwrites the existing file if there is one.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->ReadNotebook
<!-- -->Reads a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) and returns all of the cells with their outputs.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->NotebookEditCell
<!-- -->Completely replaces the contents of a specific cell in a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) with new source.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->WebFetchTool
<!-- -->Fetches content from a specified URL and processes it using an AI model. Takes a URL and a prompt as input, fetches the URL content, converts HTML to markdown, and processes the content.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>My original input (<code>“describe what’s in this project”</code>) then gets transformed into the <code>dispatch_agent</code> tool call with this instruction:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>Analyze the repository structure and determine what kind of project this is.
</span>Look at the file structure, package.json, and any configuration files to understand the tech stack,
<!-- -->then provide a concise summary of what this project appears to be.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This is then transformed into a few <code>view</code> tool calls for those files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>README.md</code></li>
<li><code>package.json</code></li>
<li><code>pages/index.js</code></li>
<li><code>pages/post.js</code></li>
<li><code>pages/travels.js</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The result of feeding those files back to an LLM makes it into the following summary:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>This is Kir Shatrov's personal website/blog built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. It includes:
</span>
<!-- -->- Blog posts on tech topics (Ruby/Rails, databases, engineering leadership)  
<!-- -->- Photography gallery  
<!-- -->- Travel map/history  
<!-- -->- Speaking engagements  
<!-- -->- Fabrication projects (woodworking/making)  
<!-- -->
<!-- -->The site uses markdown for blog content with posts dating back to 2015, following standard Next.js project structure.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The above took 40 seconds of LLM time and cost me $0.11.</p>
<p><img width="896" height="242" src="https://kirshatrov.com/assets/post-images/2025/claude-describe.png"></p><h2>Writing new code</h2>
<p>My next test input was:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>Please write a bash script which displays the top story on Hacker News.
</span>It should show the title, the link, and the number of points.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>That spawned an agent use that has attempted to read <code>https://github.com/HackerNews/API</code>. But Claude’s self-limiting security policy has stopped that:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>Error: Cannot fetch URL "https://github.com/HackerNews/API". For security, you can only fetch URLs from hosts that the user has mentioned in their messages or that are found in CLAUDE.md files or project files.
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Then it tried to read <code>https://hackernews.api-docs.io</code> and run into the same error.</p>
<p>Then it tried to read <code>https://firebase.google.com/docs/database</code> and the same thing happened.</p>
<p>It then changed the strategy and outputted this:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>I apologize for the limitations in accessing external URLs. Due to security restrictions, I can only fetch URLs that have been mentioned by you or are in project files.
</span>
<!-- -->The Hacker News API is hosted by Firebase and provides several endpoints, including:
<!-- -->
<!-- -->- `https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json` - Returns IDs of top stories
<!-- -->- `https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{id}.json` - Returns details of a specific item
<!-- -->
<!-- -->To create a bash script to fetch the top story, you would:
<!-- -->1. Fetch the array of top story IDs
<!-- -->2. Get the first ID from that array
<!-- -->3. Fetch the details for that ID
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Here's a basic bash script example:
<!-- -->
<!-- -->#!/bin/bash
<!-- -->...
<!-- -->
</code></pre></pre>
<p>What’s interesting is that none of that got saved or executed. So I’ve typed <code>save that and execute</code>.</p>
<p>Now, remember this prompt from the beginning?</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>Analyze if this message indicates a new conversation topic.
</span>If it does, extract a 2-3 word title that captures the new topic.
<!-- -->Format your response as a JSON object with two fields: 'isNewTopic' (boolean) and 'title' (string, or null if isNewTopic is false). Only include these fields, no other text.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Like any other input, my <code>save that and execute</code> command had to be run through determining whether it's a new topic or not.</p>
<p>Saving the file involved two tool usage calls:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Replace</code> to write the file</li>
<li><code>Bash</code> with <code>chmod +x hn_top.sh &amp;&amp; hn_top.sh</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Now comes the fun part. Any <code>Bash</code> tool use is preceded by this this prompt:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>&lt;policy_spec&gt;
</span># Claude Code Code Bash command prefix detection
<!-- -->
<!-- -->This document defines risk levels for actions that the Claude Code agent may take. This classification system is part of a broader safety framework and is used to determine when additional user confirmation or oversight may be needed.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->## Definitions
<!-- -->
<!-- -->**Command Injection:** Any technique used that would result in a command being run other than the detected prefix.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->## Command prefix extraction examples
<!-- -->Examples:
<!-- -->- cat foo.txt =&gt; cat
<!-- -->- cd src =&gt; cd
<!-- -->- cd path/to/files/ =&gt; cd
<!-- -->- find ./src -type f -name \"*.ts\" =&gt; find
<!-- -->- gg cat foo.py =&gt; gg cat
<!-- -->- gg cp foo.py bar.py =&gt; gg cp
<!-- -->- git commit -m \"foo\" =&gt; git commit
<!-- -->- git diff HEAD~1 =&gt; git diff
<!-- -->- git diff --staged =&gt; git diff
<!-- -->- git diff $(pwd) =&gt; command_injection_detected
<!-- -->- git status =&gt; git status
<!-- -->- git status# test(`id`) =&gt; command_injection_detected
<!-- -->- git status`ls` =&gt; command_injection_detected
<!-- -->- git push =&gt; none
<!-- -->- git push origin master =&gt; git push
<!-- -->- git log -n 5 =&gt; git log
<!-- -->- git log --oneline -n 5 =&gt; git log
<!-- -->- grep -A 40 \"from foo.bar.baz import\" alpha/beta/gamma.py =&gt; grep
<!-- -->- pig tail zerba.log =&gt; pig tail
<!-- -->- potion test some/specific/file.ts =&gt; potion test
<!-- -->- npm run lint =&gt; none
<!-- -->- npm run lint -- \"foo\" =&gt; npm run lint
<!-- -->- npm test =&gt; none
<!-- -->- npm test --foo =&gt; npm test
<!-- -->- npm test -- -f \"foo\" =&gt; npm test
<!-- -->- pwd
<!-- --> curl example.com =&gt; command_injection_detected
<!-- -->- pytest foo/bar.py =&gt; pytest
<!-- -->- scalac build =&gt; none
<!-- -->- sleep 3 =&gt; sleep
<!-- -->&lt;/policy_spec&gt;
<!-- -->
<!-- -->The user has allowed certain command prefixes to be run, and will otherwise be asked to approve or deny the command.
<!-- -->Your task is to determine the command prefix for the following command.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->IMPORTANT: Bash commands may run multiple commands that are chained together.
<!-- -->For safety, if the command seems to contain command injection, you must return \"command_injection_detected\". 
<!-- -->(This will help protect the user: if they think that they're allowlisting command A, 
<!-- -->but the AI coding agent sends a malicious command that technically has the same prefix as command A, 
<!-- -->then the safety system will see that you said “command_injection_detected” and ask the user for manual confirmation.)
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Note that not every command has a prefix. If a command has no prefix, return \"none\".
<!-- -->
<!-- -->ONLY return the prefix. Do not return any other text, markdown markers, or other content or formatting.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Command: chmod +x hn_top.sh
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Once the security is assessed, it will try to grab the actual commands to let users make them always allowed to run</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>Extract any file paths that this command reads or modifies. For commands like "git diff" and "cat", include the paths of files being shown. Use paths verbatim -- don't add any slashes or try to resolve them. Do not try to infer paths that were not explicitly listed in the command output.
</span>Format your response as:
<!-- -->&lt;filepaths&gt;
<!-- -->path/to/file1
<!-- -->path/to/file2
<!-- -->&lt;/filepaths&gt;
<!-- -->
<!-- -->If no files are read or modified, return empty filepaths tags: &lt;filepaths&gt;&lt;/filepaths&gt;
<!-- -->Do not include any other text in your response.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Which renders the following UX bit:</p>
<p><img width="896" height="226" src="https://kirshatrov.com/assets/post-images/2025/claude-bash.png"></p><p>You can imagine that having to call an LLM at most twice for every <code>Bash</code> tool use makes things somewhat slower.</p>
<h2>/init</h2>
<p>Claude Code provides <code>/init</code> command which creates <code>CLAUDE.md</code> with generated contents about your project. Below is the prompt for that.</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>Please analyze this codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file containing:
</span>1. Build/lint/test commands - especially for running a single test
<!-- -->2. Code style guidelines including imports, formatting, types, naming conventions, error handling, etc.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Usage notes:
<!-- -->- The file you create will be given to agentic coding agents (such as yourself) that operate in this repository. Make it about 20 lines long.\
<!-- -->- If there's already a CLAUDE.md, improve it.\
<!-- -->- If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include them.\
<!-- -->- Be sure to prefix the file with the following text:
<!-- -->
<!-- --># CLAUDE.md
<!-- -->
<!-- -->This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The prompt launches a <code>BatchTool</code> agent with a few more tool calls to collect more files — based on that context prompt that hints it the directory tree:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>"type"</span><span>: </span><span>"tool_use"</span><span>,

</span>        }
<!-- -->      }
<!-- -->    ]
<!-- -->  }
<!-- -->}
</code></pre></pre>
<h2>Wrap up</h2>
<p>Overall, Claude Code tends to be more generic and secure for the price of extra time and money billed on more tokens.</p>
<p>This is very much unlike Cursor which would never attempt to analyze suggested bash tools. And I would have most often prefer that Claude Code's approach.</p>
<p>I've also noticed that it uses <code>claude-3-7-sonnet</code> for most things that require reasoning, and <code>claude-3-5-haiku</code> for simpler calls like parsing Bash commands. But still, <code>claude-3.5</code> can be quite an overkill for those and <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> would do that 10x cheaper ($1.5 vs $15 per 1M output tokens).</p>
<p>Still, in terms of UX, Claude Code is the winner for an agentic tool that runs in console. <a href="https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider" target="_blank">Aider</a> is close, but not nearly there in terms of reliability and UX. While Claude Code is a single NPM package (still requires a modern-ish version of Node which likely requires NVM installed), Aider's installation process self-installed <code>uv</code> on my machine just because it needed it. And <a href="https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands" target="_blank">OpenHands</a> had to download ~10Gb of Docker images.</p></div></div>]]></description>

I thought I would share my experience of maintaining an Android app.

              I was chatting with a fellow web developer recently and made a joke about the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> and
              <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tags, only to discover that he had no idea what I was talking about. They’re a part of web history that’s fallen off the radar and younger developers are
              unlikely to have ever come across them. But for a little while, back in the 90s, they were a big deal.
            </p>
            <figure id="attachment_17882" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17882">
              <a href="#lightbox-p-attachment_17882" title="Zoom in on image" aria-haspopup="dialog" role="button"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="https://danq.me/_q23u/2020/11/dreamweaver-blink-marquee.png" alt="Macromedia Dreamweaver 3 code editor window showing a <h2> heading wrapped in <marquee> and <blink> tags, for emphasis." width="1024" height="586"></a>
              <figcaption id="caption-attachment-17882">
                Even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Dreamweaver">Macromedia Dreamweaver</a>, which embodied the essence of 1990s web design, seemed to treat wrapping
                <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> in <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> as an antipattern.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Invention of the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> element is often credited to <a href="https://montulli.blogspot.com/">Lou Montulli</a>, who wrote pioneering web browser <a href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net/">Lynx</a> before being joining Netscape in 1994. <a href="http://www.montulli.org/theoriginofthe%3Cblink%3Etag">He insists that he didn’t write any
              of the code</a> that eventually became the first implementation of <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code>. Instead, he claims: while out at a bar (on the evening he’d first meet his wife!), he
              pointed out that many of the fancy new stylistic elements the other Netscape engineers were proposing wouldn’t work in Lynx, which is a text-only browser. The fanciest conceivable
              effect that would work across both browsers would be making the text flash on and off, he joked. Then another engineer – who he doesn’t identify – pulled a late night hack session and
              added it.
            </p>
            <p>
              And so it was that <a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/old-software/web-browsers/netscape-navigator-2-0">when Netscape Navigator 2.0 was released in 1995</a> it added support for
              the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag. Also animated <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format (file)s">GIFs</abbr> and the first inklings of JavaScript, which collectively
              would go on to <em>define</em> the “personal website” experience for years to come. Here’s how you’d use it:
            </p>
            <pre><code>&lt;BLINK&gt;This is my blinking text!&lt;/BLINK&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
              With no attributes, it was clear from the outset that this tag was supposed to be a joke. By the time <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language, version 4">HTML4</abbr> was
              published as a a recommendation two years later, <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/HTML40-plus-blink.dtd">it was <em>documented</em> as being a joke</a>. But the Web of the late 1990s
              saw it used <em>a lot</em>. If you wanted somebody to notice the “latest updates” section on your personal home page, you’d wrap a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag around the title (or,
              if you were a sadist, the entire block).
            </p>
            <figure id="attachment_17890" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17890">

            </figure>
            <p>
              In the same year as Netscape Navigator 2.0 was released, <a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/old-software/web-browsers/internet-explorer-2-0">Microsoft released Internet Explorer
              2.0</a>. At this point, Internet Explorer was still very-much playing catch-up with the features the Netscape team had implemented, but clearly some senior Microsoft engineer took a
              look at the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag, refused to play along with the joke, but had an innovation of their own: the <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tag! It had <a href="http://www.lissaexplains.com/fun3.shtml">a whole suite of attributes</a> to control the scroll direction, speed, and whether it looped or bounced backwards and forwards. While
              <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> encouraged disgusting and inaccessible design as a joke, <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> did it on purpose.
            </p>
            <pre><code>&lt;MARQUEE&gt;Oh my god this still works in most modern browsers!&lt;/MARQUEE&gt;</code></pre>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <marquee>Oh my god this still works in most modern browsers!</marquee>
              </p>
              
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              But here’s the interesting bit: for a while in the late 1990s, it became a somewhat common practice to wrap content that you wanted to emphasise with animation in <em>both</em> a
              <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> and a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tag. That way, the Netscape users would see it flash, the <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> users
              would see it scroll or bounce. Like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code>&lt;MARQUEE&gt;&lt;BLINK&gt;This is my really important message!&lt;/BLINK&gt;&lt;/MARQUEE&gt;</code></pre>
            <figure id="attachment_17887" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17887">
              <a href="#lightbox-p-attachment_17887" title="Zoom in on image" aria-haspopup="dialog" role="button"><img decoding="async" src="https://danq.me/_q23u/2020/11/IE5.gif" alt="Internet Explorer 5 showing a marquee effect." width="640" height="480"></a>
              <figcaption id="caption-attachment-17887">
                Wrap a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> inside a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> and <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> users will see the marquee. Delightful.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              The web has always been built on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">Postel’s Law</a>: a web browser should assume that it won’t understand everything it reads,
              but it should provide a best-effort rendering for the benefit of its user anyway. Ever wondered why the modern <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element is a block rather than a self-closing
              tag? It’s so you can embed <em>within</em> it code that an earlier browser – one that doesn’t understand <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> – can read (a browser’s default state when seeing a
              new element it doesn’t understand is to ignore it and carry on). So embedding a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> in a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> gave you the best of both worlds, right?
              <em>(welll…)</em>
            </p>
            <figure id="attachment_17889" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17889">

                Wrap a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> inside a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> and Netscape users will see the blink. Joy.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Better yet, you were safe in the knowledge that anybody using a browser that didn’t understand <em>either</em> of these tags could <em>still read your content</em>. Used properly, the
              web is about <em>progressive enhancement</em>. Implement for everybody, enhance for those who support the shiny features. JavaScript and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> can be applied with the same rules, and doing so pays dividends in maintainability and accessibility (though, sadly, that doesn’t stop people writing
              sites that needlessly <em>require</em> these technologies).
            </p>

                Personally, I was a (paying! – back when people used to pay for web browsers!) Opera user so I mostly saw neither <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> nor <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> elements.
                I don’t feel like I missed out.

              I remember, though, the first time I tried Netscape 7, in 2002. Netscape 7 and its close descendent are, as far as I can tell, the only web browsers to support <em>both</em>
              <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code>. Even then, it was picky about the order in which they were presented and the elements wrapped-within them. But support was
              good enough that some people’s personal web pages suddenly began to exhibit the most ugly effect imaginable: the combination of both scrolling and flashing text.
            </p>
            <figure id="attachment_17892" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17892">

              <figcaption id="caption-attachment-17892">
                If Netscape 7’s <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> didn’t already make your eyes bleed (I’ve toned it down here by installing the “classic skin”), its simultaneous
                rendering of <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> would.

              The <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag is very-definitely <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=blink">dead</a> (<a href="http://tstbtbt.com/">hurrah!</a>), but you can <a href="https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-blinking-effect-with-css3-animations.html">bring it back with pure&nbsp;</a><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets"><a href="https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-blinking-effect-with-css3-animations.html">CSS</a></abbr> if you must.
              <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code>, amazingly, still <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=marquee">survives</a>, not only in <a href="https://remysharp.com/2008/09/10/the-silky-smooth-marquee/">polyfills</a> but <em>natively</em>, as you might be able to see above. However, if you’re in any doubt as to whether or not
              you should use it: you shouldn’t. If you’re looking for digital nostalgia, <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/8442/internet-nostalgia-2010s-geocities-tumblr-vaporwave">there’s a whole

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-a3c25e27=""><h3 id="the-joy-and-pain-of-emacs" tabindex="-1">The Joy (and pain) of Emacs <a href="#the-joy-and-pain-of-emacs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Joy (and pain) of Emacs&quot;">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>I use emacs, which might be thought of as a thermonuclear word processor.<br> —Neal Stephenson, <em>In the Beginning was the Command Line</em></p></blockquote><p>Some years ago, I went through a phase that I imagine many software developers go through at least once in their careers—a period of intense fascination with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Emacs</a>. "Emacs is a great operating system that only lacks a decent text editor", as the old joke goes. This rang fairly true in my own experience. Emacs is ostensibly a text editor, but really it is a gateway to a whole world of text-based, flexible tools for managing data of various kinds. Tools like <a href="https://magit.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Magit</a> and <a href="https://orgmode.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Org-mode</a> offered (and still offer) unique ways to make sense of a codebase, track tasks, manage notes, automate and integrate with other systems, etc. This was "personal computing" at its purest; most modern GUI productivity apps felt like toys in comparison.</p><p>Emacs is a powerful tool, but it also demands a lot from its user. Eventually I got tired of dealing with the host of plugins and customizations that I needed to keep my system running the way I wanted. I'm at a point in my life where I would rather spend my spare time on hobbies, hanging out with family and friends, and otherwise not messing around with a patchwork of ELisp code snippets that I've cobbled together from various sources. I gradually stopped using Emacs in favor of more modern tools that are less flexible but also less of a hassle.</p><p>However, I often found myself missing some of the features that Emacs provided –&nbsp;<a href="https://orgmode.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Org-Mode</a> in particular. Org-Mode is a tool for writing hierarchical text documents, and can serve as the foundation for an entirely text-based workflow for note-taking, agendas, and various forms of personal knowledge management. Once you get the hang of it, it's very intuitive. Some people manage their entire lives through Org-Mode and use it to have years of information at their fingertips.</p><h3 id="obsidian-an-org-mode-replacement" tabindex="-1">Obsidian: An Org-Mode replacement? <a href="#obsidian-an-org-mode-replacement" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Obsidian: An Org-Mode replacement?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>I'm currently in the process of preparing for a new role on a new team at my job, and I have a lot of projects to get up to speed on. Enter <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Obsidian</a>: a markdown-based text editor and note-taking app that has a lot of features useful for "personal knowledge management". Obsidian is proprietary software, but like Emacs it has an extensive system of <a href="https://obsidian.md/plugins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">community-provided plugins</a> that support all kinds of different workflows (currently I'm using the <a href="https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-tasks-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Tasks</a> and <a href="https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=dataview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Dataview</a> plugins, both of which let you dynamically aggregate different kinds of content from across documents in one place). Unlike Emacs, out-of-the-box usage of Obsidian is very straightforward (there's even a good Vim mode!), and there is a well-designed iOS client as well (the lack of an easy way to see tasks on a mobile device was one of the biggest limitations of Org-Mode in my experience).</p><p>Like Emacs, Obsidian can be used in a lot of different ways. If I'm going to be successful with this tool, I need to have a vision for how I want to use it. I did a little bit of research about frameworks for personal knowledge management and came across the <a href="https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PARA</a> method. The basic idea behind PARA is that you file all your various notes or documents into 4 distinct folders: <strong>Projects</strong> (actionable, short-term), <strong>Areas</strong> (long-term responsibilities or recurring work), <strong>Resources</strong> (useful info to reference later), and <strong>Archive</strong> (anything from any other category that is no longer active). Uncategorized notes typically go into a dedicated inbox folder, and then get organized during a weekly review session. The system seems pretty simple, which I hope will help with being consistent over time. I'd rather have a simple system that I can consistently apply as opposed to a complicated one that I give up on after a few months. PARA is software-independent but it's easy to implement in Obsidian – a "vault" in Obsidian is just a collection of folders and files. My top-level vault structure looks like this:</p><div><pre><code><span><span>00 Inbox/</span></span>
<span><span>01 Projects/</span></span>
<span><span>02 Areas/</span></span>
<span><span>03 Resources/</span></span>
<span><span>04 Archive/</span></span>
<span><span>Attachments/</span></span>
<span><span>Templates/</span></span>
<span><span>DASHBOARD.md</span></span>
<span><span>README.md</span></span>
<span><span>TODO.md</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In addition to the PARA folders (which are numbered to keep them in the desired order) I have an Inbox, an "attachments" directory (Obsidian will put any attached files there automatically, keeping the rest of the structure uncluttered), a "templates" directory for re-usable content, and a small number of top-level files&nbsp;– a dashboard that pulls together items from various places (using the Dataview plugin), a master todo list (which pulls in tasks from all documents and organizes them, using the Tasks plugin), and a README file to remind me how things are structured. Everything else lives on one of these folders – typically the Inbox first, and then one of the PARA folders after review.</p><p>We'll see how well this works in practice, but this is my plan for now.</p><h3 id="why-bother-doing-this" tabindex="-1">Why bother doing this? <a href="#why-bother-doing-this" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why bother doing this?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>I mentioned above that I stopped using Emacs because I no longer wished to spend the time or effort in fine-tuning and maintaining the custom workflows I was relying on. Setting up a personally-curated system (complete with its own acronym) to manage notes, bookmarks, tasks, etc. sounds like a lot of similar fiddly computer work. So why bother doing it?</p><p>The rise of LLM-based AIs like ChatGPT amounts to a paradigm-shift in human-computer interaction. If Steve Jobs was building bicycles for the mind, then Sam Altman is operating a fleet of automated driverless taxis like the ones you can currently see cruising the streets of San Francisco. These tools offer a lot of convenience, but you are increasingly a passenger being taken along for a ride.</p><p>I'm not a complete AI doomer (not yet at least), but I worry about how much people may start to <a href="https://publiccomment.blog/p/you-ll-never-think-alone-17051813d0b4a40f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">outsource their own thinking</a> to these tools. I worry about succumbing to the convenience myself if I'm being honest.</p><p>So what is the value of maintaining a personal knowledge base in the age of AI? Task-tracking and note-taking are practical and useful, but ultimately I want to treat my own thoughts as if they have value. I want to be a little more intentional and deliberate in my own thinking, and to have a space to engage in dialog with my own ideas. I want to be able to draw from my own knowledge instead of relying on AI assistants for everything. Maybe such an approach can even be complimentary to using AI tools; with the right plugins Obsidian can serve as an MCP server, which would allow tools like Claude to discover and read items in your vault. Perhaps this could offer the best of both worlds. But the key thing is that the AI is the <em>assistant</em>, and my thoughts and ideas remain my own.</p><p>At the end of the day, I still want to ride my own damn bicycle.</p></div></div>]]></description>
